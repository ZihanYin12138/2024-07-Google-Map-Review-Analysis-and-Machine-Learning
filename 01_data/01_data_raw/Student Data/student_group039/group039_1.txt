This company is great.  John came to my residence and took great care of us. He is professional, punctual and very knowledgeable. He had my system with a blown motor up and running in no time. I'm so glad there are companies like this still out there.< /Text>

The first company came out and while barely looking said we needed a new system and it would cost upwards of $20K. We called to get a second quote from another company. They came out and did the evaluation and then we never heard anything again after that. Finally we called Grizzly and FINALLY felt like we got good quality service. They were very honest and straight forward. They didn't sugar coat things, but I also felt like they were only telling me what I actually needed repaired. Very professional and responsive. I will definitely use them again anytime I need HVAC service.</Review></record>

Damon with Grizzly Mechanical came to our property and worked diligently to repair our issue. This company has great customer service and go out of their way to make sure the customer is satisfied. I highly recommend Grizzly Mechanical.
John with Grizzly Mechanical was very professional and thorough and it was evident that he knows yhis trade very well.
He explained all of the options to rectify our situation and when he left our AC was blowing cold air again.
I am very pleased with our experience and I would highly recommend Grizzly Mechanical to anyone who needs this service.<//Text>

I noticed my AC wasnt running as well as it had in the past and had Grizzly come out for a diagnostic. Matthew was on time, very professional and was great at communicating what he was doing, the issue found, and recommended process of repair. I am highly satisfied with the quality of service I received and will be my go-to heating and air company moving forward.< /Review>

Grizzly Mechanical did a fantastic job! The service provider my home warranty sent either didn't know what they were doing or they were trying to swindle me.
John came out and had the problem diagnosed and fixed within 30 minutes. He was very professional, friendly, and understanding of the situation. He thoroughly explained everything to me, completed the repair, and did the proper diagnostics after installing the capacitor.
I am so thankful that Grizzly Mechanical was available soon (appointment was on the calendar for two days after my call). I will most certainly be calling them for future issues, and I will definitely recommend them to any of my friends and clients.<//text>

Owner David gave me a consultation on installing a whole house fan. While I declined getting the service done due to having a lathe-plaster ceiling which the cutout in my ceiling may hurt the structural integrity of my ceiling, I appreciated the honesty, professionalism, and options given by him. Definitely consider them for your heating and AC needs.<//Text>

< Review>
Grizzly was sure up to the challenge trying to install a central heating and air conditioning system in my old farm house.  As if that wasn't enough I also had a 2 1/2 foot false celling.  I wasn't sure it was even possible!  They said it was and did an excellent job of it.  Nothing came through the false celling except the vents.  They were all very patient and knowable while answering my questions.  I would recommend them to everyone.</Review>

<Review>I wish I could give 1,000 stars! I can’t say enough how IMPRESSED I am with Grizzly. From Dave coming to do the bid, to everyone in the office and ESPECIALLY the techs that came out to do the work. They were so friendly, professional and knowledgeable. I even had to leave my house for awhile and completely trusted them all. I don’t think we’ve ever encountered such amazing customer service. A HUGE thank you to everyone. You will not be disappointed if you need their services.< /Review><time>1595528603466< /time>< Resp>

Each step was seamless.  The few requests that I made were taken care of without question and the quote was very competitive.  They also installed an air purifier that is keeping me very comfortable as I have problems with allergies and asthma.  I'm hoping I'll be in better shape come next fire season.  All their workers were professional, helpful and friendly.  Brandon even helped me install the app for the WIFI thermostat and helped me understand how to use it and operate the thermostat on the wall.  BTW it's really good.  I highly recommend Grizzly Mechanical.<//Text>< Rating>

<Text>First, Grizzly quoted a better system at a competitive price.  The two technicians who installed the system were very knowledgeable and professional.

John, the technician, has been out to our house a few times for AC issues and has been prompt and professional every time.  Grizzly Mechanical is an excellent value.  They are professional, responsive, the quality of work is excellent and they are always on time and if they are running late they will call with an ETA.  I highly recommend them for all your AC work.<//text>

<review>Our heater went out Dec 23rd and Grizzly came to the rescue that same day. Dave was very polite and respectful to our home. I was surprised and pleased Grizzly was able to come out day of and had the part we need to fix our heater. My family had a warm Christmas thanks to Dave and Grizzly Mechanical.</review>< pics>

<review>Just had Dave at Grizzly Mechanical install a whole house fan for me last week. Dave is friendly, knowledgeable, and meticulously clean. He explained everything to me beforehand, showed up on time, and got the job finished sooner than expected. He even handled getting the permit for me, and was able to come back when the inspector arrived to answer any questions. I highly recommend Grizzly Mechanical!<//review>< pictures>

The first time fixed it we thought but I had a inspector come out for bug issues. That inspector said it was leaking from a hole. Sean came back out but there was no hole just a lot of condensation. The next week he came back and recapped my line so there was no longer a condensation problem. The entire time Sean and everybody from Grizzly were very professional, kind and just plain awesome. I would definitely use them again in the future! And I have to say it's nice having a home that's not 90 degrees on one side now.</text></record>

Very fast response time for an AC problem on a hot day.  Showed up on time, very professional, thorough and reasonably priced service.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Turned out to be a minor problem with programming a WIFI thermostat after a power failure and a homeowner (me) that did not know the difference in HVAC programming code for a heat pump or heater.  The tech quickly diagnosed the problem, inspected the heat pump, added some refrigerant and tested operation.  The tech discussed regulatory changes making R-22 obsolete and offered alternative suggestions for replacement of the old (1995) unit and operating tips.  Great service for a minor issue with thermostat.<//Review>

< review>
Can't say enough great things about Dave and the entire crew at Grizzly. We started working with them about two years ago (when our winery moved into a new location) and the experience could not have been better. Dave came out for an estimate, we talked through a few different options and he put together a super-competitive quote (one that even included some of my thoughts). When it came time for install...Dave and John were there on time and even managed to finish the job ahead of schedule. It is worth noting that we had several different trades in the building at the same time...but that didn't seem to bother them at all. After things were wrapped up, Dave took the time to program each component of the system and go over all the specifics (it's kind of a complicated set-up...at least for a novice like me).

And their service after the fact is spot on as well. We've had to call them out a couple of times for issues (equipment defects) and they have always come through...usually within an hour or two. For our money...Dave and the folks at Grizzly are just the best.<//review>

Dave from Grizzly Mechanical did a wonderful job repairing my air conditioner.  He is a hard worker and explained to me everything that he was repairing. He came out the next day I called him.   The air conditioner has not worked this well for 20 years.

The weather was 104F to 106F for several days and I had hired another licensed air conditioner contractor a few days prior to finding Grizzly. After paying them, they abandoned the job and would not answer my calls.

Grizzly was a great experience and I recommend them highly.</Text>

<Name>Barbara Guffey</Name><Text>We called to ask how much it would be for a bath and a trim for our 50 pound chow. Was told about 50.00.
Made the appointment for 9:00am. Dropped our dog off at 9:00 and they said they would call us when he's done.
Never heard from them until my husband went over there about 3 and was told he still wasn't done. They called us at 4 to say he was done.
When we picked him up they charged us 85.00 but that wasn't the worst part.
He was SHAVED down to his skin!! This was supposed to be a trim!!! Then they shaved his back legs but left his front legs  long.
I don't know where these people got there training but they need to listen to there customer!!!< /Text>< rate>

So many amazing features for one space. Dog grooming school, puppy training,  and they keep puppy while you and your family head out of town for a weekend get away. Perfect space for your little fur babies.</review>

Allen's is the best. We have never used another hotel. I was referred to this wonderful business by a co-worker and I actually travel more now because I am so confident in my pet's care and she loves this place more than our house I think haha. Awesome people who care and the prices are very reasonable.< /Review>

Mollie must have enjoyed her stay.  When the attendant brought her out from the kennel, she didn't want to leave.  I paid for extra long walks, because she is use to walking and walking with me.  I will use Allen's Pet Resort again and again.  Allen's was recommended to me from other friends.<//Text>

The staff at Allen's Pet Resort is so very helpful and caring!  I had to find a new boarding facility this year after my former Vet/boarder retired and closed the practice  I found Allen's and I wish I had known them all along!  Huge facility, with lots of extra exercise optlions that you can add to your pet's stay. But even without "extras" your pet will be openly exercised individually in a large play area.  The kennels are very large with indoor/outdoor access.

This is a great Resort for pets and I guarantee you'll love the staff!< /Text>

<text>My pup was excited to see me, and he was settled and tired which is exactly how I want to bring him home. He wasn't stressed and settled back at home very easily.  The staff kept me updated on how he was doing during his stay. I know now the next time he stays there he's in very good hands. They are awesome!!!!< /text><user_id>112039726063802740776</user_id></record>

<review>This is the best place for grooming your pet! We have been coming here for years. My grandparents took their dogs here for grooming, my parents take their dogs there for grooming, now my husband and I take our dog there for grooming. My dog is now 13 and she has been coming here since she was a pup. They always recognize her and the staff is so friendly. They always shave her and bathe her however we ask, never too short or too long. Thanks guys!< /review>< resp>

<review>Boarded my 3 cats there for just over 2 weeks. The staff were friendly and were caring to my cats. We called to check on them and were always given a thorough report. Place is out in the country. Clean and safe.  My cats were happy and healthy when we picked them up.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I felt they knew my pup.  We were in a pinch and had to leave him there for daycare.  Julianna gave us a report card and was spot on my puppy personality.  In the day was there I know his needs were met and good care.   The rates are reasonable and they offer 45 mins play time 30 min walk which is a plus for my high energy nervous whippet.  Thanks again Allen’s pet resort.<//text>

<text>We drove from Texas to northern California for a wedding; the dogs had to be boarded while we were on site at the wedding. I was worried about finding a boarding facility relatively close by that I would trust with my two pups. Allen's Pet Resort was very friendly and responsive while booking the dogs' stay and it seemed like the dogs had a great time and were well cared for. I felt very comfortable leaving my dogs there.< /text>< pictures>

Friendly, professional and caring staff. I have used Allen's Pet Resort many times over the years and can't speak highly enough of the staff. Very clean and safe kennel out in farm and orchard country between Stockton and Lodi. Your beloved pet (s) will receive safe and caring boarding and services there.< /Text>

We have been taking our dog to Allen's Pet Resort for over 2 years. I enjoy and true their staff. No hidden fees. It seems our dog enjoys it as well.</Review>

Boarded my dog for a week while on vacation. Received no phone calls about any problems. My dog was skin and bones when I picked him up. It didn't look like he ate the entire time I was gone. I've worked at kennels, and we'd always call if a dog goes longer then 2 days not eating. Horrible experience and I'd NEVER recommend.<//review>

Our first time boarding here, and wont be our last! Pleasantly surprised they treated our 100lb. Siberian Husky to a bath...and he looked amazing! I appreciate the care they took with him. Thank you for keeping him happy and well taken care of for us!</text>

I just want to say that this is more this is more of a shelter than a resort all they do is they keep the dogs in kennels and go outside two times a day they do not interact with other puppies or dogs and they don’t provide you with the update and how they’re doing while you gone and every time I call to ask about them I get a rude respond, also I think they should provide them a bath if they there for more than a week, I paid separately for a bath and that wasn’t even a good job they were super stinky they were super stinky from the kennels, the whole time they been telling that they were eating good and when I picked them up they were much skinnier,I would never ever go again!!!</review>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>I couldn't give this business enough praise if I tried. We are in a situation with our dogs where we are having to keep them in a boarding place for a long period of time, and the people at Allen's Pet Resort have been so helpful and understanding.  I can really tell that everyone who works there cares about the animals they are taking care of.  When I call to check up on our dogs, the people know my dogs by name , and can tell me specific details about how my dogs are doing.  Everyone is just so caring, you can tell that they love working there.  I have been to 2 other boarding places in the area, and I didn't have good experiences at either one.  I'm not taking my dogs to anywhere else but Allen's Pet Resort.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been using Allen's Pet Resort since early 2000.  I have had nothing but wonderful service and loving care for my animals.  I have a special needs cat and feel very comfortable leaving his at the "spa".  I know they care.<//text>

<Review>Who would have thought you could get great sushi two hours outside of Sacramento. This spot has obviously been around for awhile and they have their food dialed in perfectly!

You'd be hard pressed to find tempura that strikes the appropriate balance more perfectly and as you get into the sushi each plate kept on delivering one after the other.

Highly recommend trying this spot out!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Service outdoors was exceptional! We didn't care for the sushi rolls that we ordered. We'd like to go back and try other types, to tell the truth, we haven't been there for years, until they have the outdoor seating. The tea was delicious and hot. We only tried to sushi rolls and there is so much more on the menu. When they open again I would definitely go back.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809b703c13955a49:0xe883c4300b10c06a<//GmapID></record>

Great service even though they were down a server.   We had the Bali Hi Roll and the Ray's roll and both were equally good.   The adamant need salt and the mission was kind of plain but over all a good meal.<//Review>

This is truly the best sushi in town. The service is very very good the wait time is somewhat long but so worth the amazing sushi that comes out it's pure art. the Miso soup is amazing and they have craft Japanese beers that are absolutely mind-blowing. We went with her family with her 6 months old daughter and that was fear was great there were other families there. We had a great time and will definitely be coming back and make this place our go-to for Japanese style cuisine. I'm a chef so I speak from a professional perspective. Truly impressed by this place's quality :)</review>

<Review>So... they changed their menu-not the best move. We went a week prior to their menu change and couldn't wait to come back.
Their rolls were to die for but... they took those off. Along with many other tasty treats.
We ordered a side of broccoli and they literally gave us 7 small pieces of broccoli- thanks for that laugh.
One star because their shrimp tempura is still the best.
Disappointed. Not going back.< /Review>< user>

The tempura is the lightest and best you can find, and the new menu gives you more choices. All of the food is high quality, and the green tea ice cream dessert was perfect!< /Review>

Delicious.Our table enjoyed salmon kama--a special surprise!   We also shared a few rolls, the one with mango was so fresh, with many distinct flavors that somehow harmonized perfectly. Thanks for a great experience.<//review>

We liked the decor and the cleanliness of the restaurant. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. She was also very helpful with menu selections. I expected a bit of a language barrier  but was pleased to find that there were none. The sushi, sashimi, soft-shell crab, and tempura vegetables with shrimp were all wonderful and well prepared. I only wish that there were more of a variety of dipping sauces for the sashimi. Thumbs up Kaido's!< /review>

I appreciated and enjoyed the recommendation of one of the employees ( I think his name was Matt), who recommended a dish based on the criteria of what I told him that I like. Lets just say I will definitely go back and continue to try other items on the menu. Awesome experience for a lets just say, less than novice sushi lover..< /review>< gmapID>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>We have gone to this restaurant several times and the food is always outstanding, really! That said, last time we went, we experienced an unusually long wait time between ordering and having our food served. The cook came out personally to apologize and offered free dessert, but a half-hour of sitting at a table, watching other's food was being served is completely unacceptable. Also, phone reservations cannot be made until 4:00 PM, and the restaurant opens at 5:00. Less than convenient.</text><resp>None</resp>< Time>

<text>So was bout 6pm Was looking for sushi for take out...was told this place was good/great went in to order was greeted by hostess was givin menu while looking at menu literally 5 sec later was told by her there was a 3 hr wait i looked around at a empty restaurant with bout 3 tables she said the wait was because of a 11 top party comin in ne moment n there was lack of cooks in kitchen now we drove 20min to this place and ten min trying to find parking, because i was told about how good it was n its the best in town well the sushi might be good but the lack of hospitality by the hostess really threw us a curve ball all my girlfriend an i wanted was 3 rolls  togo... i understand if the restaurant was busy but that was not the case the way the hostess talk to us n said "ya like its going b like a 2 n half hour to 3 hrs wait"we asked for dine in she said "both" n i asked if theres n other sushi places round here n said theres one in nevada city like 30 min away n took your menus n we walked out, shame cause we found a nice sushi place 2min from there place called Aozora with a great friendly hostess asked us if wanted water will we were decideing on our rolls she recommended some rolls she likes, which we got one of, basically a total different experience! n Aozora had some music on just a better vibe there, n was same amount of tables in aozora then at kadio. And only took 15 min to make our food at Aozora shouldve dined in maybe next time cause there will b a next time at Aozora 5 stats for them! Maybe we wernt dressed nice enough for kadio but just felt judged right when we walked in...<//text>< pictures>

Great atmosphere, staff is fantastic.

Rolls were great as was the sake nigiri.

Minus a star as we went with the chefs choice dinners (mix of nigiri and sashimi) expecting a omesake type dinner. Many if the dishes weren't up to par in my opinion.

Overall you'll have a good time and receive above average cuisine. I recommend sticking with rolls and appetizers.<//review>

<review>The Lucy roll is the only real vegan options for entree's...I'd like to see more vegan options on the menu don't they know fish in the Pacific is completely saturated in radiation from the  Fukushima plume...and farm raised fish is concentated filth, steroids hormones antibiotics and tortured beings....more items of vegan choices please the Lucy roll the wakame salad and miss soup were great vegan items...no murder needed!

Always excellent fresh fish. Good attentive service. Best sushi in GV and NC.  Owners committed to great food and service. The tempura is the best I have ever had.  Dead on consistent. Can't go wrong here. Kaz, mrs. Kaz and sushi chefs are wonderful people.<//review>

<username>Lily Lu<//username><Resp>None<//Resp><review>Foster City has great quiet neighborhoods that was respectful of one another.  We went to Boothbay Park to celebrate Easter with family.  There was several families at the park and we all kept our distance from one another and wore our mask.  The park was clean and had plenty of picnic benches for everyone along with BBQ grills.  Plenty of shade from trees to a large pergola.  There is also two playground,  one for younger kids, that everyone had a blast on. Great place to go,  especially during covid.  We had no worries as everyone played respectfully and kept their mask on.</review><time>1617586261564</time><user>101494456476095781591< /user><gmap_id>0x808f9f31c4fc2763:0xea4d1df70b663e7</gmap_id>< Rating>

Beautiful outside space. As someone in the business I can appreciate the beautiful job the landscapers do. The separated parks for big kids and little kids was a nice touch, saving my daughter from being overwhelmed by equipment or kids too big for her</review>

Boothbay offers tennis, softball and soccer fields. The children's playground is one of the better ones and is well visited. Bathrooms are open dawn to dusk. It also has a large group event area with shaded tables and BBQs that can be booked through FC Parks & Rec. For any dog owners, the area behind the tennis courts provides a great play area away from the roads - you often find other dogs here especially early in the morning.< /Review>< user_name>

Reasonably spacious park. It's has a nice playground for kids including a small one for little kids. Several BBQ grills including a covered one (it can be reserved). It also has tennis courts, baseball field, basketball court, nice space for biking and a small parking lot. It gets quite windy during summer but I always have fun here.< /Review>

<text>Boothbay Park is only a couple of blocks from our house, so we go here pretty regularly with our kids.  The playground is great, and there's plenty of space to run around.  There are also tennis courts and a basketball court, as well as a huge field for soccer and baseball.  They have a nice, covered seating area for parties and BBQs.</text>< Pics>

<text>I too was there for the event now know as "Boothbay Miracle." For those interested, it was the day Joel DiSosta flipped a quarter and it landed on it's side.

Why was a quarter flipped you ask? To determine whether an ancient alien race would destroy all humans or destroy all cheese products. Thank Chan none of them had to happen. It was a Christmas miracle.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f9f31c4fc2763:0xea4d1df70b663e7< /gmapID></record>

Great store. They have great prices in fish supplies, and prices matches my heater to almost half the price. They have a good selection of cat and dog supplies too. They even have a self service dog wash, they have everything but a dog. Totally recommend.< /review>

I came in to buy supplies to care for a stray cat in my backyard (while we were waiting for her to be adopted) and they were extremely helpful. I hadn't idea what I needed and they helped pick everything out. If I decide to adopt, I'd come here to buy my first supplies after my great experience.<//review>

They have a self dog washing area, for a great deal of $40 for five washes! Used the area 3 times already after 3 separate beach trips. Saved us tons of time, because the set up makes washing a dog so easy!

Also had our expensive hard to find dog food of choice! Staff is super friendly.< /review>

Hayden recommend a kibble dog food to me that he has had success with.  My dog has gotten tired of her kibble, and only wants home cooked meat.  I tried Hayden's recommendation, and my dog dived into her bowl and ate every morsel.  Thank you, Hayden!</text>

The dog wash is very nice. They provide shampoo and towels. If you buy a dirty dog card for $25 you get 5 washes. A very good deal.<//review>

The dog wash stations alone are worth the visit. Two deep tubs include shampoo, towels, blow dyer and apron all at a reasonable price. You can save more if you buy pre-pay for five washes. On site grooming and vaccination and a good selection of other pet sundries.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><text>It sure is a petshop. Has things for pets, and sells them too. Like a shop, but for pets. Well, obviously not for pets, it's for humans. Pets aren't capable of the abstract concept of purchasing goods with faith based currency (at least I think). So don't try to get your cat to buy you anything from the store. Trust me, they won't know what to do. It's like, where are your manners, cat? Not even a simple "Hi, how are you doing?" to the employees or anything. Maybe it's my fault for not raising my cats with manners or gratitude, but I can't say I didn't try.

So anyway, yeah, it's a pet store.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I just uploaded a few pictures on the Pet Supplies Website , called and wrote to the mgr. I took my dog on Tuesday October 9th to the groomer. And i had been noticing my dog sleeping more, walking less. Well i picked her up and notice the groomer cut my dog, underneath her leg. And didnt even let me know she basically pulled my dogs skin.. This is the worst experience ever. Since Martha left this place is worthless .... dont take your dog here.< /Review></record>

Food was delicious. Everything came out super fast. Flavor was just the way I wanted it. You get to pick the flavor for everything.  Server was super nice. Everyone was friendly.  They even have a cool little robot that brings your food out.<//Review>

Lobster had to much garlic for me was good though garlic bread was garlic bread corn on the cob was unbutterered. Or seasoned. They serve beer. Short ribs are probably my favorite
.Service was adequate Substituted salad for French fries. Whole thing cost about $80.Also has a robot named Bella for a waitress</review>

<Review>The food was great. The best shrimp I have ever had and my husband had the king crab legs. I understand business's trying to keep operating costs down but there are some things you just can't. I have never seen king crab legs served in a bag with cheap shell cracker, no small pronged fork to get the meat out and small cheap thin paper napkins. $42.00 market price for only the crab legs, nothing else comes with the meal.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x8091439f69f4043f:0x670fee008af117a9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was there because it is highly recommend from someone I trust with my appetite. I had the fish and chips and it was delicious. Nice  cut potato fries and several slightly crispy pieces of cod . My friend had fried shrimp which were tasty too.
You're given a container of tarter and one of ketchup. Hot sauce you got to ask...
I'm returning...<//Text>

I was really looking forward to experiencing a great fish restaurant here in Merced.   I paid for my order at 4:42pm; ordered fish sandwich ' garlic noodles, shrimp and fried soft shell crab with salad. I waited just a little under  45 minutes for my order as I watched people who came after me who were "dining in" get there food. The music which was playing was totally inappropriate with sexual remarks and racial slurs. I wish  I could share a picture of my BREAD  sandwich, the fries were cold, the shrimp was tasty but cold, the only thing warm were the garlic noodles, which were also tasty. Sadly I will have to continue to wait for a good fish restaurant to come to town.</review>

< Review>
It's with a heavy heart that I leave this one star review. As a bag of crab customer since opening day I've seen the quality steadily decline although I do admit they have a good product. I just cannot continue to pay 30 to $35 without a drink by the way for food that is subpar over fried or cold. After receiving cold clam chowder and shrimp that was so over fried that it was like eating a taco shell over my shrimp along with the usual pile of cold soggy fries I've decided I can no longer eat at bag of crab. If you are willing to roll the dice this is for you but it's not for me good luck bag of crab. I won't be back.<//Review>

10/10 If you're a garlic lover and want a buttery yet a BAM in your face spice, go for the atomic sauce &  Dynamite X for heat.. I placed an order for C3, shrimps (heads on) with king crab legs! Super savory! I would definitely recommend this place!</review>

<text>Horrible experience. Went to eat with my husband his food came out and about 15 min later the waitress came to tell me my food should be out shortly. My husband was just about done with his food so I told her to cancel my food. She looked shocked and said she had to go tell her manager. The manager came over asked if I wanted to cancel in which I replied yes. What is the point of going out to eat together if your not eating together.< /text>< resp>

Had my wife go get dinner for the first time there.Well I told her to get me the Crab salad..My Crab was both cold and burned.We will never go back.Next time if we want some warm not burned fish we will just go to Long John Silvers.Or we will take the trip up north go Moss Landing and enjoy some real crab and the view of the ocean.Thats what good fish dinners be 👍<//Review>

Care to explain why the 6 piece wing is $6.95 and the 10 piece wing is $11.95?
The 6 piece is literally 4 cents cheaper per wing. The smaller order is cheaper. I just cant understand. Anyway I am trying this today, if it is not 5 stars I will update my review. If I don't update, it was great. But for the love of god why is the 10 piece a worse deal -_-.< /review>

Theres no option for zero stars. The soft shell crab was almost nonexistent on the sandwich. Maybe make you're bread smaller if that's what you are going to use. It didnt even cover 1/4. Lots of fries but they were very over done.<//Review>

<Text>If I could give 100 stars I would. We ordered on a busy Friday night for takeout. We had two crab boil bags with potatoes, corn, & sausage added to each bag. We also added an extra pound of crab on the side, some garlic parm noodles & some lemon pepper wings.. let me tell you something this was hands down the best seafood and wings we have ever had and my hubby and I cook boils often at our own home which we love! Service was great, food was ready in 15 minutes, portions were perfect, seasoned well, and the price for all of that was under 100$!! Support this business! We need them here in Merced. Thank you bag-o-crab. We will be forever customers.</Text>< Pictures>

The food is great. The spaghetti was actually more like alfredo. The shrimp was large and fresh. The po boy sandwich was large and delicious. The clam chowder was also delicious. The place just blew past my expectations.</Review>

It's so nice to have a cajun place in Merced. Food was delicious! If you want Hot..order medium. Extra hot ..order dynamite. We had the original cajun and it was good. We will try the atomic next.< /Review>

<Review>I am very disappointed in this place I order a lb of mussle, a lb of king crab, and a lb of headless shrimp the  lb of mussel  was only 8 mussels in my order my pound of shrimp is like 1/2 a lb. And let's just say I only received 4 thin legs of king crab I doubt it was 1lb. I dont mind spending money but this is ridiculous. the flavor is not all that great no salt only butter and I ordered mild received spicy. I dont recommend  this place not worth the money.  People stick to the boiling crab or jade garden.<//Review><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Just had a Strimp Po Boy and cajun fries. Every thing was delicious but couldn't eat the bread without scraping
off the tartar sauce, The sauce tasted terrible.( About 2 months later I tried out the Chicken Po Boy, had No lettuce and Nasty Mayo. I also got Garlic fries which I didn't bother eating because they were cold plain fries with a dash of dried garlic sprinkled on top ,the rest were plain. Also I ordered the Lemon Pepper Chicken Wings, they were ok but we're all drumletts,no flats.< /Text>

<Date>1609980866424</Date><rate>1<//rate><Text>Overall, I like the food. But what I am upset about is that I went to order inside just like an hour ago, and they wrote my name wrong and also got my order wrong and missed one of my order. I ordered a drink along with my food, but the lady told me that the drink should be in the bag but it was not. Also, I ordered a coke, but they put sprite on the order even though she repeated the order back to me as a coke for the drink. Yet, I did not even get the drink at all, which I have paid for. My server name was kimberlee. I ordered on January 6, 2021 at 4:02pm.

My fave rehearsal studio. Sad that money and greed cause such independent businesses to close its doors. 😪</Review>

Called the studios on the off chance that there may be space at short notice for me to practice the drums and spoke to the main man, Joe. Lovely fella. He just said come on down, we'll sort you out. $24 for two hours - great deal if you finish before 5pm. And he threw in the cymbals for good measure as it was my first time there. Really good quality kit and head and really great, punchy sound in the studio.< /Text>

< review>
This the Bay Area's least diverse mosque. The ladies in women section are very unwelcoming to outsiders or new muslims. Durning Ramandan its very hard to pray because the parents allow their children to run wild. The English translation is done by phone and if it does work the translator is too busy answering questions or dealing with kids to translate.<//review>

She comes off standoffish at first but I think the area they're located makes her be that way. She's a nice lady down inside once you get her to open up. .... She gave me a free charger for my batteries because she knew I haven't upgraded my stuff since like 2012... That's how I knew she had a heart of gold but you gotta dig a little. If I was local, this would be the only place I'd go. Thanks for your help lady... I'll never forget you.< /Text>< Pics>

Best e-cig place around here. By far the biggest selection and good prices. Cool promos like a freebie if you spend over $100. Shane is super helpful and always makes sure all the flavors my wife and I like are in stock. Plus they always have new stuff to try out.</review>

<Review>Nice place, decent prices. The employee I talked to wasn't very knowledgeable about the products though. Wanted a beginner set up that doesn't leak, got a tank that's well known for leaking. Found a better one online after a couple hours of research.<//Review>< rate>

<text>One of their employees has almost 0 knowledge  on vapes, and said vaping is just as bad as smoking gave me some fake bad juice reccomendations and then woulnt give me my free vape juice even though i pointed out the buy 3 get 1 free sign right behind his head. If a shop is gunna hire tweakers that have 0 knowledge and 0 respect id much rather buy my vape supplys online for half the price.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Build an Ecig is the only vape shop I go to.
Who ever left a bad review  sorry for your experience yet the company of juice has nothing to do with the owner. Do some research on the FDA regulations because in fact not one vape shop can give you testers unless you pay any more. Vaping is  different to everyone, just like eating we all have different taste buds. To blame it on the owner is just childish. I've had some juice I didn't like either it's not the staffs fault.  It's the company so maybe the real problem here is the company you tried. Remember keep it local so our community can thrive.    Regardless of this rant build an Ecig is the only place all ever go to.  Friendly staff huge selection and there willing to help with anything😍😍😍😍😍😘< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808164f92111efeb:0xaceca3e5ed1bedfb</Gmap_id></record>

Like a lot of smokers, I thought I would save some money by purchasing vaping products, but as soon as cigarette prices went up, so did vape prices. Way to unnecessarily gouge our wallets guys. Box-$90 batteries-$20 charger for those batteries-$37 vape juice for 2 weeks-$70...
*UPDATE* I'm all for supporting local business, but they're ripping you guys off. Seriously, look on eBay, $40 for combo tank and mod, $15 for 100ml good ejuice 4port charger $15. That's like a 200% markup on ejuice. Shameful guys.<//review>

They provided an extremely professional and quality tinting job with zero complaints. Most definitely the place you should go if you are looking to get your windows tinted and are concerned about quality. I will be back with any future vehicles.<//review><Response>None</Response>< pictures>

I called and spoke with Robert about re-tinting all my windows in a 2015 Altima. We spoke about Wincos Ceramic films and how much heat rejection they provide during the summertime in the Valley. Man, was he right!...that Wincos tint really does help cut down the heat in my car! It does make a huge difference having all my windows tinted.

After about a week or so of them being done, I noticed an issue with one of the front windows. I called him and told him what I was seeing, he said it was not a problem to get the issue fixed. We set another time for me to bring my car back based on my schedule. He told me to hang out a bit if I had time to wait (which I was good with), they got on it right away and got me back out of there and on with my day in no time!!!

A fair price, from a nice and friendly guy who does quality work and stands by it! I’ll be sure to bring our Edge Sport in to have some Wincos tint installed on it as well! Thanks Robert!</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><username>Tyler Williams<//username><review>Tint Masters is great! They were able to get my GF's car tinted in under 2 hours while I waited in their eclectic waiting room. For a gear head like myself all the vintage car parts and photos on display in the shop was like heaven. Great conversation with Robert the owner, and I'll be sure to go back for any auto tint needs in the future. Highly recommend!<//review><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

<review>Robert has great product selection and his installers are detailed and meticulous. I've taken all my cars there,  BMWs, Ftypes, Landrovers, and the tint always looks amazing.. Lasts.. Doesn't bubble, peel, chip or fade. It keeps the ultraviolet heat off my face and protects the interior. They have great customer service skills... Just go.<//review>< Name>

Owner and employee's treated me and the wife great with respect and honesty, took the required steps and time to help me understand what the differences were between different options.

In the end we paid a great price, and the car looks amazing already, but Robert said the tint would look even better after another 2 days of curing in the sun.

I would for sure go back and do it again, and you owe it to yourself to take a look here if you want tinting done on your baby.<//review>

Wow. The reviews were not wrong. These guys are the best. Matt & Robert are amazing. Very friendly and do a great job of explaining the various types of tints they offer and the different levels with a heating test. Quality of work is spot on and it only took about 2 hours. Pricing is also affordable compared to the competition. Waiting room is very nice. I can't recommend this place enough.  I will be bringing all of my cars here and recommending them to all of my friends and family. Great job guys!!!!<//Text>

Thanks to everyone at Tint Master City! I highly recommend this place as Robert and the team are very friendly and professional. I had my front windshield done and it came out perfect with no bubbles at all. I highly recommend this place for anyone that needs window tints for their vehicles.</Review>

These guys are awesome! Matt was extremely helpful, both with getting me an appointment that worked with my timeline and with choosing tint based on darkness and heat reduction. All in all they had me in and out in one day, and even stayed late to make sure my car was done. Two hard working guys, it shows in their level of service.<//text>

I've had my previous car tinted at some other random company years ago and was met with the worst service, so for my current car i was way more paranoid than a normal person, i was instantly like this place is gotta be good right? all these 5 stars, theres gotta be something up, but no, nothing was up, this place really is too good to be true, took my wifes audi here aswell as my truck, back to back, the audi i cant even change the oil cuz its so complicated of a car, but man these guys were go gentle and left no sign whatsoever of them even being there, no loose door panels or bubbles, solid job, 10/10 would 100% come back as well as recommend to others!</Text>

First time here they do a temp check, and check your ID.  They make you wait and someone comes and takes you to the back. They have a assortment of different "Items" Drinks, Flowers, etc. If it is your first time they give you a discount and free t shirt. I would definitely recommend stopping by everyone was nice and friendly.</review>

The Higher Path is a great place to for all your cannabis desires. The plants, excellent music, engaging art, and skylights all contribute to a vibe that enhance your experience here. The number one reason I will be returning though is due to Cat! She was exceptionally knowledgable and genuinely cared about helping me find the right products for my needs. She even assisted me with choosing products that supported business with a cause, which was of particular interest to me. I highly recommend coming to The Higher Path so you can see what I mean, don't forget to ask for Cat.<//review>

I love the overall look and feel of the place. It has a very open and comfortable vibe that is complimented by the music choice.
Cat was extremely helpful and took time to answer questions I had about products I was unfamiliar with.
I think I just found my green forever home. Thank you, Cat 😊</Text>

The only thing is that I couldn't sample the topicals but that could be for covered safety reasons as many places. That would have been helpful the prices are a little up but it is also a good experience where it is worth it so I would totally go back there and not somewhere else in the future and they have consistency in their products so the item will not vanish if you've used it and decided to go for it again like many other dispensaries. I got a cute little t-shirt as well with my order.<//text><GmapID>0x80c297d32af426d1:0x596f47189055bdd6< /GmapID>< resp>

<Text>I love this place. The vibes that they give off are immaculate. I just recently went in because it was my first time there and i liked what i saw as far as reviews. The woman when i came in was very sweet and uplifting. Adding to that, my bud tender was awesome. His energy was great, he showed me his shoe collection (we both happened to be sneaker heads) and he told me about his wife. He also told me his story with cannabis and he will give me advice in ways to save. You can tell that the individuals here take pride in their work and their energy isn’t comparable to any other dispensary I have been to. I plan to continue trying to drive out to LA every week to pick up from them! You’ll instantly love the vibes here.</Text>< user>

< Review>
As an older person, just using for the first time, there is some hesitancy with what to try and how to use it. Your customer service as provided by Cat, put me at ease and really helped educate me and ease me in. She is very friendly, knows her products well, and the differences between them. Really takes the mystery out of choosing when one is new to the game.< /Review>

I have been coming to The Higher Path for years now. The service and quality is honestly unmatched. It's just such a good overall vibe and experience. The staff is super friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable. My most recent experience was with "Rocky". He was so positive and helpful and put me in such a great mood. I truly have never had a bad experience here. Great selection of products, super kind staff and just an overall great time. 10/10< /text>

<Text>The Higher path is my go-to dispensary. From the decor, ambiance, selection, and personal service, this shop has it all. Legitimately the most comfortable and seamless experience, it’s the reason I’ve been coming back for years. Not to mention, their weed is very high quality.
Budtender today was Rocky. Super genuine guy, very helpful and had an awesome attitude, despite some difficulty on my end.

Thanks to the whole establishment, I’ll definitely be back.< /Text>< pictures>

I really enjoy going to the place I have been going there ever since I moved to Sherman Oaks. Not only is there a store absolutely beautiful but their service is really spot on everybody is very knowledgeable I usually get the house joints which I enjoy they are fairly priced. A few of the workers there like Rocky Tristan and a few of the girls are just so sweet and it’s awesome that you can just order online and pick up behind their store very easy access and I always feel calm once I get my goodies</Review>

<text>Very good selection of products, Budtener are very knowledgeable and respectful. All buds I've got from this business have been near dry! not damp as a rag! (Dry Bud good! Wet bud bad!) The Prerolls are well worth the try and Reasonable prices! The big plus of shopping here is they give you a shirt and every time you show up to shop with shirt on you get a $1 house joint. The house joints are not cheap and I often buy a few with every visit I've made and even had them deliver too all A++ service.< /text><GmapID>0x80c297d32af426d1:0x596f47189055bdd6</GmapID>< Rate>

Placed a quick online order and it was ready within 10 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised when I received a text message asking me for my size for my free shirt! The Higher Path is not hard to find and there’s parking all around. I picked up my order and got my $1 joint, plus my free shirt. I was in and out within 5 minutes. Nico was very informative and so friendly! Even the guard that checks your id as soon as you get in was extremely friendly. Good vibes all around, I will definitely be back.

My favorite dispensary.
The customer service is great, & their selection is amazing.
The protocol for COVID-19 is excellent, no concerns at all. Everything is clean, and know that their attention to sanitation/disinfection is a priority.
I appreciate the knowledge that the staff has, and appreciate their guidance when wanting to try something new.
The drive up/pick up in the back is super convenient.<//text>

<Name>Heather Herazo< /Name><review>First, let me say I have been coming here since 2017, and always has impeccable customer service. However, lately it’s seems they have gone down hill with that. I needed a something to smoke shatter, and  the person help by at least me by sending out a more knowledgeable employee. Although, I what I am disappointed in is the fact that I was overcharged 10$ From the first product I was originally going to purchase. Also, I was not told I needed to buy butane, as I was buying a torch as well. I guess they assumed I knew that. (But actually I have never used a dab rig or torch) I drove back and they did refund me the 10$. To be fair I did use the drive up in the back. I think the best way to solve this rushed customer service issue is to hire a couple more people in the drive up area. I will still return as this was just one incident. I just felt I needed to express this.< /review><user>100845083855921829699</user><Time>1616726278959<//Time><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

Seems like a good place I will try one more time. The only thing that I did not like is not automatically getting the new customer discount. When someone pays $70 for an 1/8 for the first time, you want to make sure you keep those customers. This was good bud but I am not so sure it is worth the price. This seems like another $50 1/8. So it might be that this place has high prices but I always let the Cannabis speak for itself.

This was my mistake you guys did give the discount. Sorry..</Review>

I positively love this place. It’s the first dispensary I ever visited that didn’t feel the least bit shady or the slightest bit unsafe. Feels like you’re about to visit a spa or something. Even during Covid times, they are warm and friendly and relaxed. Alex helped me today and she’s a total sweetheart. Was funny and kind and helpful! I cannot recommend highly enough. ❤️👍👍<//review>

I had tried some product through a friend & then decided to get some of my own. Teresa was super-helpful online helping me decide what to try, & the woman who met me curbside was very friendly. They also gave me a first-time discount. Will definitely be back.<//review>

I love this store. It is my favorite dispensary, in the Valley and probably the city also. The $1 pre-roll alone are worth going there for, but the prices on shatter and sauce were very reasonable. The budtender that helped me (I think her name is Sylvia) was awesome! She helped me get the most bang for my buck. I really enjoyed her energy. A+++.<//Review>

Excellent customer service and products! Also a ton of specials every day of the week. Ever since recreational became legal I have consistently been going to the Higher Path specifically because of their selections, staff, selections, and deals. Never had a single bad experience over 2 years. Easy 5/5<//review>

< Review>
I spoke to a budtender named Teresa online while trying to determine the best products for my specific pain needs. Teresa was fantastic and helped me not only find a variety of product that could choose from fitting my criteria, but also explained how the different strains and percentages affected pain relief!  Thank you so much Teresa!< /Review>

Rubber ducky here! Updating you on my new found extended family. They are now offering us Patients (very ill) a wonderful program called “compassion program”. Please call or get online and chat with the wonderful very well educated budtenders like Lauren (knows everything in products and services). Call them and find out what and how you can join the program. Trust me I am on their program and they have saved me in so many different ways! Blessings to you all and run not just for the goods but the knowledge 🙏😷<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Seems like a good place I will try one more time. The only thing that I did not like is not automatically getting the new customer discount. When someone pays $70 for an 1/8 for the first time, you want to make sure you keep those customers. This was good bud but I am not so sure it is worth the price. This seems like another $50 1/8. So it might be that this place has high prices but I always let the Cannabis speak for itself.

This was my mistake you guys did give the discount. Sorry..</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzViDXQCDsPPsFtnw5MQNiwLY7cA-2PGHsH3zh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_aW1jAzl_5PFCQlYBqq5qFyyxrTJtvwj5qUcr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6FNL53UeRV8KcXM7HYsD4GLwtk3-LC0GF09vB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlYG46gThKi58siOa9Arah7sAbMV4QyVAYNUsU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQdIagEZg2TIme97WkyNzXYrXOjHiYWwhRC_cU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPAq5n_GQ0vqUzA22pcOgMxGNL0dnWvwKJ6yyh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpe2-T3Vexj952mPwb7lks1PlwffdTFO_vu_k7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiHeLK5PWhnDyu8RCGYeoqEmJjvNa1u13b4yxL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

I was looking for some assistance in order to pick out a strain that would help with back pain and restless legs. I was lucky enough to interact with Theresa. She gave me some amazing recommendations. Her patience and knowledge is everything you could hope for during any shopping experience. THP sets the bar high when it comes to customer service and she more than lived up to expectations. Shopping here is always a great experience. Thank you so much for your patience and service.<//review>

< Review>
Teresa from The Higher Path was awesome in answering questions about my mom... and waiting on me as I looked for all the different things my mom has that don't seem to be working for her..... and suggesting a ratio of THC:CBD that might help with her pain.  She couldn't even sell me anything because I'm not in the same state, yet she took the time to help educate me... at least a little, so I can help my mom talk to the local dispensaries<//Review>

The Higher Path recently created a new Compassion Program for medical cannabis patients who need, but aren't able to afford their medication.  I learned I was their very first Compassion Program patient and I was both thrilled and amazed at their kindness and generosity.  The Compassion Program is listed on THP's website and is easy and quick to complete.  If interested, please come and join the program and community.

As a disabled woman, I feel no one can truly understand how important a program like this can be for those in need.  I commend Jerrod, the owner of The Higher Path, for his compassion, kindness and generosity.  My deepest thanks to you, sir, for both creating and enrolling me in this extremely important program.  My appreciation also extends to Lauren, Jocelyn, Zach, Alessandra and all of the budtenders and support staff.  You go above and beyond each time I visit The Higher Path.

When we give to others, we strengthen ourselves, our beliefs, and the very foundation of our society.< /Review>

I was overwhelmed a bit by the variety of products and information at first. Soon after clicking the chat help support button, I was soon  helped by Teresa.  She not only hand picked my order from the bottom up, she listened to my questions and quelled my doubts . Thank UI again for my first time with the delivery service.< /review>

<review>I’ve been coming here for years, every experience fantastic. Today’s visit was exceptional, Tema taught me more than I would’ve learned in 24 hours of YouTube videos. I’m leaving with $200 of product and I’m very excited about all of it. Hard recommend. Tema is incredible, ask for her.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>There’s no signage or instructions on WMps, & don’t really explain the process. 1st Time? !!DO NOT DRIVE UP in alley!!  Got through the front to sign up, then go around in your car.  Cannot guarantee safety here.  No vehicle spacing or direction as well 1C1S. You can be handicap and wait like everyone else.  There’s a special place I go, just thought I’d try a new place.
Been to 10 new places since Covid breakout and this is the screwiest one.
1) Find parking 2) Go thru a questionable disinfected door of any kind 3) Talk to workers possibly talking to each other without masks until you go in having spread their germs all over.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1603244816736, 'text': "Hi Niel,\n\nWe never like to hear that one of our patrons was confused or stressed out, so we actually had a banner made for the back of the shop that walks you through the steps for signing up. It's so busy in the back parking lot that it's hard for our staff to stop and walk through new customers (who we usually help inside the store), but we are working to accommodate you. Come back! We never take our masks off (we have several at-risk staff members) and we'd love to help you."}</resp><gmapID>0x80c297d32af426d1:0x596f47189055bdd6<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Used to love this place until they sky rocketed prices. Vapes for 1 gram were 21. Now 67. Also charging 5 dollar curbside pickup fee when honestly they shouldnt be. I have spent 4500 there in one year and will he going elsewhere now. Also they dont have availability when you get used to somwthing and like it they end up not ever having it again. Bummer</Review>

{'time': 1603931538108, 'text': "Hi there,\n\nGive us another chance and we'll show you some great products priced significantly lower than what you're listing. We have tons of options! There is no $5 curbside fee — perhaps you were confusing it for the $3 credit card fee? That's the only fee we have and it goes right to the terminal company, not us.\n\nIf we don't have something you like simply fill out our product waitlist at thp.la/waitlist and we will call you when it's in! Often times, if we've discontinued a product, it's for good reason; feel free to reach out and ask us why we no longer carry something you liked.\n\nI hope you give us another shot to show you we've got great products, great deals (thp.la/deals) and great service.\n\nThanks,\nThe Higher Path Team"}<//response>

< review>
Always stocked with a great selection and they always have good deals and friendly employees. Since Covid though, they have been mistakenly charging me sales tax on all of my purchases, despite me using a medical card (which should exempt me). This has added up to a lot of money over time. Also their rewards system always applies backwards if your buying an item on sale. For example, I twice bought an item that was on sale for 25% off that was $25 and I used my $10 off reward. Rather than discounting the item 25% off and then applying the rewards at the end of the purchase (as most stores would) they do it the other way around. This results in a difference of $2.50. This is not a huge difference, but stores should be aware if they are unfairly overcharging customers regularly. I have shopped here a ton and will continue to do so because of their great customer service, I simply hope these issues are fixed as they have cost me a decent amount of money as they have compounded over the last few months.</review>

Trying to limit my time outside the house during the quarantine. Since The Higher Path is located so close to my weekly Ralph's trip I saved on using a delivery service. Everyone was in gloves and masks. Lauren helped me out and made an already easy experience better. Planning on coming back.<//text>

This is the most disorganized dispensary. There are few parking meters (1 space on back always taken). It takes a few trips around the block to park. About 15 minutes per trip. If you need change, Higher Path has none. I don’t see what’s so hard about keeping a roll of quarters around.

Next is the wait time. You wait in lobby THEN wait inside. There’s always more customers than salespeople, and it is hard to see the products. Brands of edibles vary, so it’s whatever is delivered recently is for sale. There’s also no sugar free edibles for some reason.

4/20 was a bust. A long line for a tour, no freebies, only things on sale were very expensive and the website contained little info about what was available when you get to the store.

I’d call first to talk to a salesperson. Order with them on their website (while you have them on the phone), so you can confirm the website items are actually in the store. If you’re driving, you’ll need extra time to find parking. I suggest a bus or an Uber.</Text>

{'time': 1567099396752, 'text': "We're very sorry to hear you haven't enjoyed your experiences with us and we appreciate you taking the time to give us your feedback. Like many places in LA, parking can be a bit tricky--but we do have at least 6 spots behind our store in addition to free 2 hour street parking on Hazeltine Ave until 6pm every day. There's also free parking on Dickens Street as well :) As far as sugar free options go we do have a few (you can always ask your budtender & they'll be happy to point you in the right direction)--we highly recommend the sugar free Cannabis Quenchers and the Fruit Slabs! Legally we aren't allowed to give away free cannabis products (this is a part of Prop 64, so that's been in effect since January 2018)--definitely be careful of any dispensary that's giving you free product, as that isn't legal. If you have further questions about our policies or would like to speak directly with a manager, please feel free to email us at info@thehigherpath.com and we'll be in touch! -The Higher Path Staff"}<//response>

Omg, I’ve been going here since before it became legal recreationally and always really liked it. I hadn’t been in the area in a while and decided to go in. It was 10% off and I bought $276.00 worth of product with 10% off which came to $249 then came the whopping 24.84 in LA city tax AND another 25.96 in sales tax. Are you kidding me???? I paid 299 total for a 249 order.  I’ve been to many great places buying the exact same products and none of which charged me $50 extra in taxes. I gave 2 vs zero stars because I liked the people and they have a nice selection but I will NEVER go back there. Thankfully my bud tender undercharged me and rang up one of the cheaper ones twice instead of a more expensive item. Normally I’d have said something but when I noticed that I also noticed the taxes and decided I have every right not to say a word except see ya. I don’t get how anyone goes there. No other dispensary I’ve been to charges taxes like that. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!<//Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1555699894980, 'text': "Hey Kel! We actually don't get to decide what taxes we charge--that is dictated by the city of Los Angeles and the state of California. As a legal, licensed dispensary we are required by law to charge these taxes otherwise we could lose our license. To break it down for you, recreational consumers (individuals without a medical recommendation) pay the most in taxes--10% Local Tax and 9.5% Sales Tax which you can see on your receipt. There's also a 15% State Excise Tax that is included in the prices of our products, so you won't see that one separately on your receipt. Patients with a medical recommendation from a doctor pay 5% Local Tax and 9.5% Sales Tax, as well as that 15% State Excise Tax included in the product price. Individuals with an MMIC from the county save the most on taxes--they pay 5% Local Tax and the 15% State Excise Tax included in the product price. We completely understand your frustration about the taxes and the desire to save as much as possible, which is why we do offer deals like our $60 Half Oz Specials, $25 budlet 1/8ths, a variety of 1/8ths at $30-$40 and Dollar Joint Fridays as well as other special text deals and Vendor Day deals. Any dispensary that you visit that isn't charging you these taxes isn't legal and we'd caution you against shopping at illegal dispensaries since the products on their shelves don't have to be regulated or tested for your safety in any way. If you have any questions about our prices or taxes, please feel free to email us at info@thehigherpath.com and we'll be happy to assist you :) -The Higher Path Staff"}< /Resp><Rating>2< /Rating>< Pics>

{'time': 1543520677507, 'text': 'Hey there! In regards to our prices, we are a legal licensed dispensary which does mean that our prices are higher than that of illegal dispensaries operating in Los Angeles. We are required by law to charge all applicable taxes to every order and we can only sell products from legal, licensed vendors that meet all Bureau of Cannabis Control requirements for packaging, labeling & testing. These new requirements that companies must comply with have caused an increase in how much their products cost to make, which in turn has raised the prices on the shelves. (We actually posted an article on our blog about this topic if you\'d like more in-depth details--you can check it out at https://www.thehigherpath.com/blog/update-on-pricing-increases-at-the-higher-path). Illegal dispensaries are able to offer products at cheaper prices because they aren\'t paying their taxes & they aren\'t selling products that meet all BCC regulations which puts you as a consumer at risk. We\'re very surprised to hear that you felt our staff was "not nice at all" as we pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service--would you be willing to email us at info@thehigherpath.com with your full name as it appears in our system so that we can get some more information about who assisted you on your visit? We definitely don\'t want our guests to have negative experiences with our staff, so any insight you can provide us with would be greatly appreciated!'}</Resp>

This is a great place to get weed.  BUT it takes FOREVER to make a simple purchase. After waiting 15 min in the back, and the owner/manager walking by about 5 times. I had to leave without making a purchase but hey, They can afford it i guess.
Better luck next time.< /Review>

Update:  The Higher Path responded to my issue and has very professionally handled it.  Being as that this was the only issue from originally having a 5 star experience, review is changed.  Thanks to The Higher Ground for getting back to me about this and making it right.  You've won back a customer and referrals.

I went in to the Higher Path for the first time on Sunday, first time in any dispensary actually.  I actually had a good experience up until I got home and realized that they double charged me for two cartridges.  I thought the total was high when I paid, but wasn't paying too much attention to the prices while listening to the budtender.  I thought maybe I missed that they were two packs, which was fine - just more product.  But that wasn't the case.  I tried calling and sending an email and I've got no response.  I think, and would like to believe the double charge was an honest mistake, but the fact that they won't respond to me makes me question if maybe they're just trying to take advantage of the new recreational customers.  They have security cameras so they should easily be able to go back and see I'm not trying to hussle them.   So, I'm out $70 plus whatever the tax is on that.  If I would have been properly charged or they would have taken any steps to fix their mistake I'd have happily given them 5 stars and been a returning customer.  So take that for what it's worth.  I guess my recommendation is go ahead and go, but don't walk out that door until you've double checked the receipt and the bag.<//Text>

Yes, the owner of the shop is from Northern California but our entire staff including management all resides in Los Angeles--so we\'re incredibly connected to our community. We\'ve actually been a proud member of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce since 2016 & also joined the San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce this year. Our prices are a reflection of the fact that we are a legal, licensed dispensary that is required by law to charge all taxes required by the Bureau of Cannabis Control & can only sell products from legal, licensed vendors. All of the products on our shelves meet the strict requirements of the Bureau of Cannabis Control in regards to proper packaging, labeling & testing--all of these changes that the companies who make the products have had to make in order to comply with these regulations have unfortunately made these products more expensive. (If you\'d like some more information about why prices have increased here since recreational legalization you can check out our blog https://www.thehigherpath.com/blog/update-on-pricing-increases-at-the-higher-path). We do work hard to offer products at a variety of price points--we have $30 1/8ths & we just brought back our $25 budlet 1/8ths yesterday! (Budlets are the popcorn buds or "smalls" of higher quality strains that we offer at a discounted price--they do go fast though!)

{'time': 1549655465627, 'text': 'Hey Ismael--sorry to hear you didn\'t enjoy your visit with us. The reason you can\'t "smell what you\'re buying" is per Bureau of Cannabis Control regulations--cannabis products sold at licensed dispensaries in California must leave the store in sealed packages, meaning that we legally cannot open the package you\'re buying for you to smell it. We do change out the sample jars every time we get a fresh batch of a strain in (sometimes more frequently if the bud in the jar seems to have lost its smell), so the flower you\'re looking at/smelling IS from the same harvest as what you\'re purchasing--definitely not "false advertising" as you stated in your review. The new packaging that flower is required to be in keeps it fresh on the shelf for longer--the containers are sealed after the fresh flower is packaged & they will not lose freshness until after the package has been opened by the consumer. One of our brands High Pack actually uses liquid nitrogen to keep sealed flower fresh on the shelf for up to 2 years. The cannabis industry is changing--gone are the days of buds being stored in large glass jars & weighed out for you when you purchase them. This is to ensure that every product is clean, tested and safe for the consumer. Any shop you go to that isn\'t selling you prepackaged flower isn\'t legal--you can check out the BCC website to read more about California laws & regulations for legal cannabis https://www.bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/index.html. The amount of time that passes between a strain being harvested & packaged has to do with the fact that it has to undergo testing & pass all Phase III requirements before it can be packaged & sold to a dispensary, so it\'s totally normal to see a harvest date that is months before a packaged date. Back when flower didn\'t need to be tested before being sold, there was significantly less time in between something being harvested & put on the shelf for sale. If you have further questions about our products or the new laws & regulations please feel free to email us at info@thehigherpath.com & we\'ll be happy to assist you :) -The Higher Path Staff'}</Response>

Place looks great but the weed is wack.. they are presealed so u cant even smell what ur buying.. they have fancy jars with lights that make the weed look great but the weed u smell or look at isnt even from the same harvest..i got an 8th for 25 of northern lights.. package says harvest 9.22.18 packaged 1.21.19 and i bought it 2.7.19. So ur telling me the fresh smelling buds i smelled aint what i bought? FALSE ADVERTISING!!! smells nothing like what they showed me. if u casual this the place for u.. if ur a conasure and like smoking kushy buds this is NOT for u.< /Review>

Seriously, you guys ROUNDED UP 41 cents from $50.59 to $51 without letting me know? Your margins are so small that you couldn't afford to ROUND DOWN to $50? You make me sick. Bad business practices.

Reply to the business' reply:
The fact it's always been your policy doesn't make it better, on the contrary, it just makes it a bad policy that's been there forever.
I run a business too, so please don't sell me on some "it's for our customers" fib. If customers can deal with change at a donut shop or the grocery store, they can deal with change in your shop as well.
If you really wanted to round prices, you could have priced items in a way that they came out as a round number after adding tax.
Or if that doesn't work, just round it DOWN every single time, even if it means you lose a few pennies. Now THAT would really mean "for your customers".

As for the LINX or whatever other system, I don't need or want to jump through hoops in order to pay the amount listed in the receipt, let alone pay any "processing fees" (if applicable) for any transaction.

Please stop trying to pass your cost of doing business to your consumers. Why don't you add a dollar surcharge to cover for security expenses? Or another dollar to pay for your internet provider or cleaning services?
You chose a line of business, it comes with certain expenses. Please deal with it the same way us other business owners deal with it.<//Review>

<response>{'time': 1544384088245, 'text': "Hey Yatir! Our policy since opening has been that for cash orders we round to the nearest dollar amount as we do not deal with change--for orders that are .49 cents or less we round down & at .50 cents or more we round up. We're very sorry that your budtender didn't effectively communicate this to you on your visit. (Looking at your order history, on your order prior to this most recent one with us your total was rounded down since it was under the .49 cent limit.) We do accept exact change through our LINX card system, so if you'd prefer not to have your total rounded to the nearest dollar we definitely recommend giving that a try in the future :) If you have other questions about our pricing, we'd be happy to answer them for you--please feel free to email us at info@thehigherpath.com. -The Higher Path Staff"}<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c297d32af426d1:0x596f47189055bdd6<//Gmap_id></record>

Yes, our prices are higher than illegal shops but that\'s because we are licensed and required by law to pay all taxes as well as only sell products from legal, licensed vendors.

Unfortunately this does mean that our shelf prices have increased this year.

Dear Jared,

You sound desperate. What ilegal shops?

Take a step back.  1/8th of top shelf indoor from a distributor is $15-20 wholesale.   Outdoor or green house is $7.50-12.50.  you should know, you have a distribution license.
.
200% profit is greed.

Enough said.

shop is fake, phony, pretentious and way over priced.

Smoke, mirrors and a used car salesman selling terrible products.  The used car salesmen in the back treat their customers as if they are better than them. Very very condescending.

Locals, Do everyone a favor, do not support this shop.  The wrong path doesn't upport anything in Sherman oaks .

The wrong path should go back to nocal.</Text>

<review>So I am the Owner of The Higher Path and I looked up the names of the reviews that gave 1 star and stated they didn’t receive a free J or had to wait too long to get what they needed and these names don’t exist in my database. So that means they have never been in my place of business before and their review has no real world interaction with my staff or me directly. It’s sad that other businesses feel it necessary to tear others down, but that is the world we live in and if you look at any other platform for reviews of The Higher Path you will see hundreds of real reviews from patients and customers that have actually entered my business.  So Mike Colton, Iago Netto, Greg Carter, and James Johnson these 4 people who gave bad reviews none of you have made a purchase from my shop before so I’m not sure why you took the time to write this but I’m sure you could be more productive with your time or please take a new job that doesn’t pay you to post bad reviews for a living.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c297d32af426d1:0x596f47189055bdd6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Go anywhere but this place you'll thank me later. The staff will "screw" you over at any given oppurtunity. If you do go to this place to buy weed: OPEN THE STAPLED BAG AND CONFIRM THAT EVERYTHING YOU'VE PURCHASED AND ARE ENTITLED TO IS IN THE BAG.  "Toking" Thursdays and "free" joint Fridays are a joke. Either the staff is too stoned to remember to give me my free joint or they're instructed "by the owner" to not give the customer the free joint unless they ask for it. The staff has "forgotten" to give me my free joint NUMEROUS times. And because of this unprofessionalism this place just lost a regular customer. I'll gladfully take my business elsewhere.
PS the free joints that they SOMETIMES "remember" to give out is terrible. The free joints"weed" is more like shredded grass with a light sprinkle of keef.
Plenty of other dispensaries in the area that won't rip you off.</Review>

We definitely understand your frustration about the parking--like most places in Los Angeles, the parking directly behind our store is somewhat limited. The good news is that there is ample free street parking on Hazeltine Ave and Dickens Street, as well as metered parking on Ventura Blvd. We do tend to get pretty busy most days, so one of the things we offer to help with the wait is online ordering for pick up. You can visit https://www.thehigherpath.com/menu.html to place your order and we'll text you when it's ready to be picked up! When you get here, tell the receptionist you placed an online order and you'll be directed to our express window to complete your transaction without needing to wait in the line for the budroom :) Was there a particular strain you weren't impressed with? We always welcome feedback about our products so that we can continue to provide our guests with the brands they love. Again, we're very sorry that you didn't enjoy your visit with us and hope you'll give us another chance in the future.

Used to come here. Will not return. Customer service has gone severely downhill. They have mismatched prices... there menu outside the door says one thing and you get in and it's 5 to 10 more... And I'm not talking about tax, that's just a basic price discrepancy , in addition to the tax. Which they tried to tax me as non medical even though I am and have been and been in there system as such. They've always been overpriced, but now they are just to full of themselves.</Text>

In regards to the pricing, we do try to keep the paper menus in the lobby up to date, but you can always check our menu on our website at https://www.thehigherpath.com/menu.html for the most accurate pricing on all of our products including flower :) We apologize for the issue with tax--medical patients do have to pay some tax, but you'll save 5% on Local Tax with an MMJ recommendation and a total of 14.5% (5% on Local Tax and 9.5% on Sales Tax) if you have an MMIC from the county. You can always ask your budtender to make sure that your file has the most up to date version of your recommendation so that we can ensure that you get the correct tax discount--when your MMJ rec expires in our system your profile will change to recreational until your new MMJ rec has been added with the proper expiration date. We definitely understand your frustration over the prices, but as a legal shop we are required to pay taxes and overall wholesale prices have increased since 2018 began--a lot of other shops are able to offer lower prices, but that's because they aren't legal and they aren't paying their taxes. We're truly sorry that you didn't have a wonderful experience with us and we'd love to offer you the option of getting a $5 joint for $1 on your next visit if you'd like to give us another try--just show this response to a manager and they'll get you taken care of! (We just tried to put a note in your profile about the joint, but the name you've provided here doesn't match anything in our system--could you email us your full name at info@thehigherpath.com so that we can add the note?

If you have specific complaints about the customer service you received, please feel free to email us at info@thehigherpath.com so that we can speak to the employee you worked with and make sure that the issue doesn't continue :) We hope you're having a wonderful start to you week & that you'll give us another chance so that we can make things right for you!  -The Higher Path Staff"}</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c297d32af426d1:0x596f47189055bdd6</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Because of the Bureau of Cannabis Control Transition Period ending on June 30th, many of the brands we used to carry are either taking longer to get their orders to us or currently cannot be carried here because they aren\'t yet compliant with all BCC regulations. The Phase II Testing that is required for all products on our shelves has backed up the limited amount of labs certified to do the testing, which results in many products taking longer to get to us than they used to. (Over the next few months this issue should be getting resolved as the labs doing the testing get on track.) We do have a Product Waitlist where you can let us know which product you\'re looking for & we\'ll contact you to let you know when it\'s in stock--you can sign up in person at the store or visit the online ordering menu on our website & click the button that says "Get On The Waitlist" right above the menu.

If you ever have other questions or concerns, please don\'t hesitate to email us & we\'ll be happy to assist you :) Hope you\'re having a great weekend & we look forward to seeing you again soon!\n\nHey Savage! Would you be able to email us more details about the strain you picked up at info@thehigherpath.com? (If you can\'t remember the strain name or brand, you can email us your full name as it appears in our system & we can look back at your purchase history to figure out what you got.) We\'re assuming that by "airpack" you\'re referring to our pre-packaged flower, but since all flower is now legally required to be pre-packaged prior to coming to us we can\'t really determine which one you\'re talking about. Unfortunately with the limited information you\'ve provided we can\'t fully address your complaint & we\'d really like to resolve this issue for you :)'}< /resp><GmapID>0x80c297d32af426d1:0x596f47189055bdd6</GmapID></record></dataset><record>
