<Review>I’m glad I came here. All the staffs were really nice and welcoming. They made sure I understood everything they were doing, and they definitely made me felt comfortable (I definitely get a bit of anxiety from the sounds of the tools). Looking forward on going back again.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have hated the dentist since I was little, but Dr. Fernandez is so kind and gentle with me, I actually don't mind going now. Her staff is friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend her for any dental needs.<//review>

At Kingsly it’s always a great experience. Every time I walk in I’m treated like family. I highly recommend them, I’ve been coming here for 7 years. I’ve referred many family members and friends and they are all happy.
They listen to what your concerns are, recently I had major work done, I was not happy with my smile. They listened to my concerns and Dr. Fernandez was able to give me the smile and confidence I’ve always wanted.

Thank you!!!!!</Text>

<date>1607004377875<//date><Name>KandyKorn 88< /Name><Review>WARNING! THIS PLACE IS NOT LEGIT. HERE ARE SOME FACTS. Theses reviews are not from people that used this dentistry. THESE ARE FALSE REVIEWS. They straight up lie and tell you, you have well over a half dozen cavities. Two other reviews on here said they claimed they had 14 cavities, those reviews were removed. There xray process is very outdated and the dentists that work there mess up alot of peoples dental work and they have to go back to get it fixed. I have spoke to actual people that have used this dentistry. THEY ALL HAD BAD EXPERIENCES. They rush everything. I was shock that they told me I had so many cavities. So I went elsewhere and it was comfrimed that Kingsly Dentistry are liars. I had only 1 cavity. DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH INSURANCE MONEY THEY CAN. TRULY HORRIBLE PLACE.< /Review>< Pics>

Don’t be fooled by this dental office. They will do work on you without your consent. If you look through and read all of the reviews, you will see that almost all of them are from the employees that work there. I’ve come to find out that most all reviews on here have the same misspelled words and grammar issues. Do not be fooled by this place. They will also have someone that does NOT work there perform work on you without letting you know that the original dentist will not be doing the work on you.

I’ve been coming to Kingsly for two years and every time I’ve been very pleased with my experience. I’ve gotten several cleanings and three wisdom tooth extractions without pain! Dr. Salagan-Fernandez does an amazing job. She uses local anesthesia, and my cheeks don’t swell up, so that’s a plus.  Her staff is very professional and polite. The office is very clean and welcoming.</Text>

The staff was very friendly and had an amazing sense of humor. They smiled and grinned through all my corny jokes. The dentist was very skilled and professional. Her techniques were impeccable, i didnt even feel her sticking the 1 inch needle in my mouth. The facility is very clean and orderly. Definitely sticking around for many years to come.</review>

I am deeply grateful for my experience with Dr. Fernandez and her staff at Kingsly Dentistry.  From my very first visit at the office,  I was made to feel welcome and comfortable both by the friendly staff and the pleasant environment. Dr Fernandez is an excellent Dentist. She took the time to explain every procedure and made me feel comfortable. I usually get tense and have so much anxiety every time I go to the Dentist. Dr. Fernandez was able to help me calm my anxiety and explained that it's going to be fine.   Her assistants are also very helpful and answered all my questions. I think having open communication and expressing your concerns does help a lot and I am happy the Kingsly staff were able to provide that.  I already referred family and friends to them because I love the service they provide. They have the best customer service from all the Dental Offices I've been. If you're reading this and looking for a great Dentist. Please check out Kingsly Dentistry and schedule an appointment.<//Text>

Love coming in to get work done! Dr. Fernandez does an outstanding job making sure her patients are relaxed and comfortable. I have yet to feel any discomfort or pain during each procedures I’ve had including wisdom teeth extractions!! I’ve had some bad experiences in the past so Kingley is definitely my permanent Dentist now. Everyone is highly skilled, attentive, and have excellent demeanor. The office is very nice and clean, staff is great! Best experience with a dentist. Highly recommend.</Review>

Dr. Fernandez is great. Had a wisdom tooth pulled and there was literally no pain. She makes sure you are comfortable. The staff is very friendly and informative. Office is clean and the equipment was newer. The doctor also made sure I was informed as to aftercare. She explained it as well as her staff. They are open one Sunday a month and I got real lucky to get in that day. They worked me in on their busy Sunday schedule. I didn't have to miss work.< /review>

The doctor takes special accommodation to the best healthful interest and care of the patients--- an extra miler. Support workers are so friendly and helpful---they even offer you cold water (free) so refreshing on a hot day!< /text>

<Review>Excellent staff & Dentist... Everyone is very polite and professional. The clinic is  easy to find and is very clean. They take every precaution to keep everyone safe from covid by cleaning each area and tools after each patient. They also enforce strict hand washing with all the staff and require everyone to wear a mask.<//Review><Date>1596834107628<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Such a fun restaurant! The food was delicious and the location was easily accessible. The service could’ve been friendly, but I enjoyed my visit all around!<//text>

I was craving Shabu but didn’t feel like going to Inner Richmond/Sunset. This place is so underrated... ordered a large ribeye beef, came with rice, veggies, even green tea ice cream for around $20. Coming back again!<//review>

It's okay for hot pot. Cheap for all you can eat. Service is a little poor, or perhaps they were just low on staff that evening</text>

I highly recommend this place if you're really hungry. The all you can eat and the all you can eat AND drink deals are amazing. The spicy miso broth and ginger chicken are the famous broths (order half and half to get both). If it's your first time to shabu/hot pot you can always ask for help or read the instructions on the plastic table sign. They have other food items for those that are not really adventurous. Great location and easily commutable.</review>

Staff seemed like they didn't want to be there. Weren't particularly friendly or approachable.

The food is nice, although dinner for two can easily reach $100 if you have a couple of drinks.<//Review>

I'm always amazed that one woman can serve everyone in the restaurant at once, but she does it. Super tasty shabu.< /Text>

The curry soup is not very flavorful and is a bit oily. Bit pricey for the amount that you get. The whole table has to do all-you-can-eat and it's $32 each, which I think is steep.</review>

The service was the worst I have ever seen! Don't ever go there!!!!!! They only had one waitress and she should NOT be hired by any restaurant! She was rude and had an attitude. I usually give >20% tip but this time only $0.01 which is more than what she deserves. For the food part, it tasted OK but after a few hours it made my stomach sick!! I am pretty sure there was something wrong with their food. So please trust me: don't go there!!!</text>

$20+ gets you a dinner set that include choice of soup base, vegetables, udon, rice, choice of meat and ice cream. Decent portion size. Relatively quiet. A short walk from Caltrain, so a good spot to catch lunch/dinner if you just missed the train.<//Text>

Reasonably good shabu shabu, and convenient if you live in Soma, San Francisco. The meat can be a bit fatty sometimes, and the rice is almost always overcooked and dry. Otherwise, quite decent. To top it off, the staff is pretty friendly too.</text>

A simple, clean, delicious shabu shabu joint in SOMA. Decently priced and has an excellent all-you-can-eat, all-you-can-drink option. The American rib-eye slices are my favorite.< /review>

<Rate>2</Rate><text>To a typical American, one might enjoy a DIY pot of warm steamy stuff in this chilly weather, but if you have had real Japanese Shabu Shabu, you might be disappointed by the sub-par meat quality, off-tasting sesame sauce, lack of puréed radish for the ponzu (offensively replaced by Vietnamese chili sauce), and a general Chinese (rough) approach to recreating food from other cultures. They might have better success if the offering was Chinese hot pot instead of a Japanese Shabu wannabe. That said, I took my chances, seeing that it was conveniently located in SOMA, and $40 after, I wish I had taken an Uber to Shabusen in Japantown instead.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808f7fd71ae723ef:0xea44d77b898fa870< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Plus the people that work there have great service. Frankie helped me out and got me what I needed!

<Review>Smaller area than most Big 5s, decent selection, gun counter employees are very nice. Wide selection of ammo, rifles, and shotguns. Got my first gun here. They have the new digital for 4473 paperwork process down pretty well and they get you through all the paperwork in about an hour, usually less.<//Review>< pictures>

Love their deals. Got the tactical backpacking bag that looked just like what like I needed and its still holding up today. Thanks guys (employees)
P.S. this is the place to go if need shoes</Review>< user_id>

I have excellent experience with this branch. This branch is not as big as the other branches I have been, but they are willing to do everything to make the customer happy. Personnel are very knowledgable about the products, and know about the shipments. The manager, Matthew, was very helpful. He tried to get the discounts as much as possible, also, I had 2 exchange items which he took care of them both with no question and made a better deal to the new items. highly recommend this branch.<//text>

Employees were welcoming and didn't mind helping me find the right size shoe given that I was looking for wide running ahoes. Suffice to say I had to buy a size larger because "wide" running shoes apparently don't exist</Review>

First time went there was not busy but it reminds me of store Modells at New York but this store need more great products and better price to gain more customer to come in. It was not bad at all I just wish had more products like Modells store have and price.</Review>

<review>Michael Gorman is the best! He was so patient with me since I was so unprepared since I haven't done taxes in awhile and also understanding of my situation and was thorough with explaining and guiding me through the tax preparation. I would recommend him to everyone and I would like to get my taxes done by him again next year! Thanks so much Michael!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I didn't really understand why a dependent who is 17 years old and still in high school did not get the Child tax credit. Online says they can get it if under 19. So I'm very confused.< /Text>

I used Turbo Tax before.  If I could have better navigated the software, I probably could have done my own taxes (which I prefer).  It is in part the money since I am retired, own no property and must watch every dollar.  I feel I should be able to do my own taxes.  Also, I understand my budget and spending history when I do my own taxes.  However, since this year meant changes in the tax code, I can't really determine how much was my difficulty with the tax software, the tax changes or that I needed to take out more taxes each month.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809ad6adf982e0d5:0xf7c282d33530bcd4<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Unable to properly explain procedures cost me over $400 in their fees and got a denial on their Emerald card advance b/c the rep explained it that it was based off my refund amount and not credit report. Well my credit report stays locked for safety precautions, so there went the explaining that I needed to unlock my credit report to be approved.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Very poor communication and took over two months to do my taxes. Some of that was because we were waiting on my ex to submit his taxes but I feel like mine should have been done so at the point that we decided we were not going to do them together mine could have just been submitted instead I received them the night of the 15th which is a tax deadline and had questions regarding some of the things that were done or were not done and couldn't ask anybody.< /Review></record>

<Review>Best 生煎包 in the bay. Best Shanghai style dumpling in the bay area. Very good dough thickness, good crisp bottom, holds juice well. Could use more scallions on top. Stuffing perfect flavor. We found spicy wontons good but with a bit too much vinegar. Cucumbers very good. Can be hard to spot in mall area, not next to Lion market but further left where other restaurants are located (small sign primarily in Chinese). Best to pay in cash, does not accept cards below $25. Highly recommend.<//Review>< rating>

Pan fried dumplings are a must-order - I’ll definitely come back for again just for those dumplings. They are crispy on the bottom, yet soft and juicy with soup inside - 6 of them for ~$8.

I ordered takeout of the pan fried dumplings, which took around 15 min. Credit can only be used when >$25.</text>

Best shengjian bao in the Bay! At a very reasonable price too. Everything we ordered was really great - pork ear, SJB, SJB with shrimp, potstickers, wonton noodle soup, another noodle with pork and black bean, xlb, and xlb with xo sauce. I will definitely be back<//text>

Super delicious shanghainese dishes. The XLB are piping hot and burst (literally) with flavor and taste. The must order dish is the Pan fried pork buns!!  Also full of hot hot soup so take care when opening!< /Text>

<review>The name of the restaurant is “lost” in the translation. The Chinese name is “李一季生煎馆”. Presumably, “李一季” is the name of the owner. “生煎” is a type of Shanghainese style pan fried dumpling. “馆” means restaurant. So, this is a place mainly for eating the pan fried dumplings. Being a native Shanghainese, I must say that their dumplings are very good, or at least among one of the best in the Bay Area. Their dumplings are full of savory juice that can burn your tongue when the dumplings are hot. So be careful when eating. Remember, you do not want to wait till the dumplings are cool before eating since the juice will mostly be absorbed by the flour skin by then.

Due to current Covid 19 situation, I can only order dumplings to go. It’s about 15 minute drive to my house and the dumplings are still hot enough to devour. Yummy!< /review><Response>None<//Response><Name>Stephen Yu</Name><GmapID>0x808fbf4fc62edb99:0x59b13a4866700eb5< /GmapID><rate>5<//rate><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1610130229127</Time></record>

<Time>1511472130470<//Time><text>Quite disappointing. Most of the noodle dishes are too oily...glistens nicely on photos...but honestly its too much for the American palate. Their signature baos are the same. The meat in the bao are a bit too rubbery. The dough skin, thin like the classic baos - but is served slightly undercooked.</text><rating>3<//rating>< userid>

<Date>1575070674937<//Date><Text>Both the pan-fried dumplings and the shanghai dumplings are really juicy and soupy here! I love the flavors of both of them as well. The skin on the shanghai dumplings isn't too thick, and the pan-friend dumpling has almost a baked texture to it. Both are made quite consistently juicy, which is a pretty impressive feat. They are also able to offer their dishes at rather affordable prices, relatively speaking. In an area where the soup dumpling game is quite competitive, Shanghai Bistro has a clear competitive advantage in the pan-fried dumpling arena. Bravo!!< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< pics>

Worst service ever in Bay Area. As there was no information on its website regarding whether this restaurant is for take out only, and as the tables&chairs were set up readily like it welcomes dine in customers, we asked the cashier politely whether dine-in is allowed. He responded with such an attitude like we were some random beggars walking inside to ask him for free water and he reprimanded us “of cuz not!”..... excuse me? The reason we asked is because we didnot know what the policy is right now. We were asking a question but not requesting or demanding anything from him.
Can’t he just respond with a simple “sorry, no”?
Later I asked him why a customer can’t ask a question if the information was nowhere to be found on its website or inside the store, he said it was the law and everyone should know already. Excuse me again！the restaurants were open in some area for dine in as far as I know. In addition, is everyone from out of the town supposed to know exactly when the law changes frequently for reopening and closing at this time? Isn’t this the exact reason we asked him at the first place?
For having an a**hole as the cashier of the restaurant, I am rating the place a one star.
Thanks for reading.
I hope the owner considers firing this cashier who has no idea of what customer service is and who desperately needs some training on it.</text>

Wonderful soups. Chef knows how make a great  broth  We've tried Chengdu egg and a fried tofu hot pot. Great salt and pepper fried dishes. We've tried shrimp (from the Shanghai menu) and calamari. We've been very impressed with everything we've tried from the Shanghai menu.

The items on the Chinese-American menu at the front are much less exciting. We'll stay with our favorite Chinese-American place for such dishes.

NOTE: There are a lot of old reviews for this address. Shanghai Bistro opened in October 2019. Older reviews are probably for the prior restaurant with different owners, chef, and menu.< /Review>< user>

On 7/5/2020, around 1pm, I walked into this restaurant and ordered the pan fried pork bun and pan fried dumplings to go, along with some soup.
The cashier was wearing a mask but not wearing gloves and his bare hands touched my food and utensils (spoons with no wrapping or any form of protection) and he was rubbing the counter and his face with his bare hands from time to time.
I didn't finish the food because the pork filling in both the bun and dumplings smelt bad.
I spent the rest of the day having diarrhea to the point that I was dehydrated. I know it is food poisoning because I had the same experience years ago.
I didnot call 911 because of the high cost. I know I will survive by just drinking enough water and eat nothing for 24 hours. However I still want to report this restaurant for its poor sanitation, unsafe food handling practices, and a cashier lacking proper training.</Text>

Advertised as "noodle house" but the noodles aren't that special.  Seats are backless and are not exactly comfortable.  Tables are small so it made me think they don't want us to order a lot a food?  The service was good when we were there.  Drinks and sweets are fine.< /Text>

<Review>hands down best pan fried dumpling.  nothing else to say.   Actually there is one thing.  pan fried dumpling is very hot inside and is full of meat stock.  If you don't wait before you take a bite, you will be burnt, and you will splash the whole table with meat stock.  better to poke a hole in the dumpling for venting.</Review></record>

<review>Real Shanghai food. So happy that we found this place, eating with tears rolling in my eyes. Their pork bun is super good! I like it better than its pot stickers and dumplings. They also have Nanjing duck blood soup(OMG), pretty authentic. It's surprising enough that this place exist in the bay area, if you like Shanghai food, you should mark this place.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fbf4fc62edb99:0x59b13a4866700eb5< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
Great Shanghai style cuisine at reasonable prices. Portion sizes are reasonable and the overall taste of their dishes is pretty good and spot on. Recommend the #1 Shanghai dumpling (similar to xiao long bao but with a crunchy bun exterior - careful not to burn yourself) and the Shrimp and Pork wonton soup. For those unfamiliar with Shanghai cuisine, it tends to have a semi-sweet and savory to sweet profile.</Review>

sweet rice shui mai - steamed perfectly

everything ordered came out hot and quick. i'd definitely go back to explore more of the menu. my only suggestion would be to do some staff training on attentiveness to boost the service.< /review><Date>1577117620469</Date></record>

I was staying across the way at Chase Suites and walked in to order food to go. Simple order of potstickers and egg rolls. They said 10 Min. I waited outside to not utilize a table. 25 Min later I quietly go in and sit in front of the counter as a reminder. I then see a woman come in, order, get her stew pho delivered to her table and THEN my food was ready to go. Not a good way to not look at least favortist or discriminatory. Food was good though.</Review>

Excellent beef noodles soup and dumplings. Cycle time is a little slow, so expect a wait. Still worth it.</Review>

<review>Their pan fried buns! Omg just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Filled with delicious soup and crunchy exterior dough. We ordered that, xlb(Xiao long bao), chili oil wontons and a braised oxtail noodle soup. I'll definitely be back with family next time. Thanks to the boyfriend for the introduction.<//review>< Pictures>

Waiting time can be long during peak periods, try visiting during less busy hours. Space is a little tight inside. Food is great, I love their signature sheng jian bao (pan fried dumpling with soup inside) is delicious, as are a couple of other dishes we tried. Will definitely be back (at a less busy time).<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The snacks are great! Xiao Yan Sheng fried dumplings duck soup.
The pork cutlet is very general, although it is thin and not oily, but it is not fragrant like an air fryer, and the meat is completely unsalted.

小吃都超棒！小馄饨生煎小笼包鸭子粉丝汤。
炸猪排非常一般，虽然薄而不油，但像空气炸锅做的，感觉不香，而且肉完全没腌入味。</text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The meat in the raw fried buns bought from the package is smelly. The fishy smell should be because the meat is not processed well, but the bad smell should be the cheap and spoiled meat bought by the store. It may be because the epidemic business is not good, and the store is not fresh in order to save costs. But the fried noodles are still authentic, and the heat is also suitable. People who are not afraid of diarrhea can try it.

(Original)
打包买回来的生煎包子里的肉是腥臭的。腥味应该是因为肉没有处理好， 但是臭味应该是店家买的廉价变质肉。 可能是因为疫情生意不好， 店家为了节约成本， 所以购买的食材不新鲜。 但是生煎的面皮还是挺地道的， 火候也合适。 不怕拉肚子的人完全可以试试。</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>(Translated by Google) The service attitude keeps declining, and I have come to this place many times one after another. The span of one and a half years before and after is really getting worse and worse. After ordering the food today, I waited for ten minutes and didn’t come. I asked for a reminder, but I came back and asked me what I ordered. ? ? The fried foreskin of the cooked vegetables is not fully cooked, and it still tastes like flour. After I finished the checkout, the payer was reluctant to say a word to me, with a Sima face. I waited for a long time and finally gave you a 15% tip. What does your Sima face mean?

(Original)
服务态度不断下滑，陆陆续续来这个地方吃了好多次，前后跨度一年半，真的是越来越不行。今天点完菜等了十几分钟都没来，问了叫催一下，结果回来问我点了什么？？？上了的菜生煎包皮没有完全熟透，还能吃出面粉味道。吃完之后结帐，收款的连一句话都不愿意和我说，一副司马脸。我等了半天菜都最后把15%小费给你了，你司马脸什么意思？</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Tell the truth, the taste of the food is not bad, very delicious, if you don't hear a male waiter and the customer quarrel, you must give 5 points, recommended. Regardless of the reason, the customer said: The guest is God, you should be better towards me, the male waiter said: "We are not God!" If you feel that my attitude is not good, I can return the money to you. You can not come to our house to eat, who will let you come? . . . . . . Ok, you insulted us all God. One of God, I will not go again in the future, and there are more delicious restaurants. Why should God go to a place where he does not take himself as God!

(Original)
讲真，饭菜的味道还不错，挺好吃的，如果不是听到一个男服务员和顾客吵架，一定给5分，推荐。不管是因为什么原因，顾客说：客人就是上帝，你应该对我态度好一些，男服务员说：在我们这里，客人不是上帝！如果你觉得我态度不好，我可以把钱退给你，你可以不来我们家吃饭，谁让你来了？。。。。。。好吧，你侮辱了我们所有上帝。上帝之一的我以后是不会再去的，做的好吃的馆子多了，上帝干嘛要去一个不拿自己当上帝的地方去受气！< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The service quality is the worst, and the shouting is based on the mentality, whoever is pleasing to the eye will be called in.
Seeing the crowds on the weekend, he clamored, "If you like to eat or not to eat, can you still call the police?"

Li Yiji, your house should go bankrupt soon. . Where are those chefs not doing it, you need a low-end population like you to clamor there🤷‍♂️

(Original)
服务素质最差， 喊号全凭心态，看谁顺眼就叫谁进去。
看准了周末人多，还叫嚣“爱吃不吃，不吃滚，难不成你还能报警了？”

李一季你家还是早点倒闭吧。。那帮厨师哪里不是做，需要你这种低端人口在那里叫嚣🤷‍♂️< /Text>< Rate>

<text>Good parking lot.  Well-laid out.  Always more adults than kids when we've been there. Kids can't race with adults, cars have different speeds. It's always fun.  Only a few arcade games, though. There's a small glow-in-the-black-light indoor mini golf course. Snack stand, open sometimes.< /text>< username>

< Review>
I think Driven is one of the most overlooked entertainment facilities in the Bay area and one of Rohnert Parks best kept secrets. For fun , excitement and the thrill of the chase , Driven is unequivocally at the top of the heap. Available for parties , business gatherings , grudge racing or just a fun day behind the wheel of a surprisingly powerful , smog free racing cart , Driven is fully capable of delivering white knuckle excitement as well as some relaxing activities like miniature golf and a video game arcade . They also have a great cafe with pizza , burgers and lots of snacks to appease the hunger your surely gonna have from all that racing excitement.</Review>

<Review>Great fun. For birthday parties. Or group of friends. Even just by yourself and join a group. Race side by side with the best and not so best drivers. As your experience gets better the faster they bump up kart speed.<//Review><time>1548176185481</time><user_name>Uriah Vogt<//user_name><pics>None< /pics></record>

Nice place to kart.  Track is on the small side, but don't let that fool you.  There is a fast part and a technical part to the track.  Staff there was nice and don't be afraid to ask for advice on karting line if you want to lower lap times.< /Text>

< Review>
My girlfriends car worked two laps and then it only had less than half power.then when there was only one lap left he came out and adjusted her throttle cable and then her car worked again. I feel that that as a rip off at the expense that you pay for a race and they won't give you another race that's poor business we are adults and these kids are not doing what's right my girlfriend did not rec or drive crazy all she did was try to race there's only three of us and the employees were rude this is in Rohnert Park< /Review>

Fun track, track barriers are falling apart though on some parts, so my cart got slapped by a hanging piece of plastic. Races are also a little bit expensive for 18 laps, but not too high to avoid altogether.</Text>

Great place to race cars and mini golf. Most games in video arcade are broken and half of the rest eat the value off your card. When told no reimbursemt was offered. Wouldn't recommended for anyone younger than the age to race.< /review>

<Text>If you love speed in just carts go here but if you like arcade and awesome mini golf don't waste your time here go to scandia a block down the employees were rude and unhelpful and the carts were falling apart no one was at the cafe or the prize station and all the games were either broken, empty on tickets or ripped you off of tickets. The mini golf was very small and only 9 holes and each hole was like 10 feet long

Don't go here if you like arcade fun and food!!!!< /Text>< Pics>

I've come here a lot and don't plan on not returning. I feel like it was only this time when the staff had a hiccup. I came around 3:45 o clock in the afternoon and paid for 3 races. After the first race which was relatively quick we were waiting for about an hour and a half then we asked when our next race was. Come to find out were weren't booked for any races afterward. So we waiting another half an hour for the second race and by that time 5:30 in the afternoon I just didnt feel like waiting anymore. I'm not sure if this is how it usually is or if things got messed up, just left with a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not saying I'll never come back either dont get me wrong, it just sucks that it was dealt with poorly and I dont feel too good about it.< /Review>

Driven is a super fun place to go karting! They usually has some long wait times to go karting though, which is surprising considering it never looks busy from looking at the parking lot outside, nor does it feel busy & crowded inside. So be sure to call ahead and scope out wait times to get in for a race. Employees are super helpful/awesome and I'll definitely be back!</Text>

<text>My children WERE BOTH ROBBED while attending this place with a field trip over Christmas break.

Someone took my 6 yr-old son's bag of quarters while he was playing a video game. My 8 yr-old daughter put her backpack in the doorless party room where the group put their stuff. Unbeknownst to me, she had brought her life savings of $137, which was in her little purse in her backpack. While the kids and chaperone were out driving, someone went into the room & stole her money.

Needless to say, we don't ever plan on going here again.< /text><Rating>1</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<gmap_id>0x808449fc37391aa7:0x14d1f7542c4ec750<//gmap_id><text>2 stars because this place has gone downhill. My son and I have raced here about 40 times over the last few years. Last time we visited, we paid for two races. They see we're returning customers so we don't have to sit through the little classroom session where they tell you the rules, etc. We each drove two different carts in the two races. The first car handled ok but the second car felt like I was driving on ice. I think the tires are either not inflated correctly or are shot. And this is where the 2 stars come in. It used to be the carts were fairly consistent. No now. Now they're beat up. It used to be that the score sheet after you raced was on a pre-printed form with the Driven Raceway logo. Now it's just a plain sheet of paper and the ink is low in the printer so the print quality is poor. In one of our races, it was my son, myself and a couple (boyfriend/girlfriend I guess). They were slower and the BF wouldn't pass his GF - didn't want to show her up i guess. They also wouldn't move over to let other drivers pass (my son and I). There used to be a flagman that would wave the passing flag at you when you needed to move over. Not anymore apparently. It used to be that drivers at different skill levels could race together because you'd be able to pass at certain points. I've been passed and I've passed other drivers. It happens. It's all good. But in this last race, there were the four of us were, riding like we were in a parade behind the girlfriend all within a few feet of each other. You would think the staff would notice. The whole staff just didn't seem to care. It can be fun but not sure we'll go back.<//text>< Date>

< review>
Karting here is fast and competitive, they provide a helmet and head sock, so great karting experience.  However, the arcade is terrible and the food court is often unmanned.  They have glow-in-the-dark mini-golf, which is cool but the course is short.  If you want a good arcade and mini-golf experience, go to Scandia just south on Redwood Dr., but the karting here is way better than Scandia's.</review>

It would be a blast if the carts weren't falling apart. Every time I've gone something is loose or wrong with the carts.< /review>

3 weeks after the CDC announces a left on mask mandates from people who have been vaccinated, restaurants all over Fresno are opening their dining rooms, and these jokers can't provide a place for the customers to sit. Still on lock down. Won't be back!</Text>

The ice cream was great, but there was a long piece of toilet paper by the tables. I told one of the employees and she said ok, but it was not picked up. The women's restroom smelled a lot! (Worse than a porta potty.) It was hard to enjoy my ice cream after smelling that.<//review>

<text>Rude server and very pushy! Damn lady, give me time to see what I want. Also, they were cleaning and the place did not look very appetizing, it was only 9 pm with another hour to close. I ended up leaving, the big/tall girl was almost delighted with a stupid look on her face that I decided to leave!

If the owners care and decide they want to replace the staff with some decent one so we can come back to this place, the server was a tall big girl with long hair ( FAKE blond with dark roots) in a top knot ponytail.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<date>1626123058992< /date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>when I was told that this company does not allow  a grace period for their customers to count /check their orders for possible discrepancies', I should have gone else where. The GBS representative told me to count my bottles and tops in the parking lot. Also I've ordered airless pump bottles from this company on several orders. Both times I did not receive what I ordered. They sent bottles with no tops and was not willing to fix their mistake by simply sending me what was missing; furthermore, over 50%of my airless pump bottles were scratched up and the aluminum lids were dented (which meant I could not fill orders using those damaged items) so I was forced to take a loss because as usual they were not willing to fix  their mistake by replacing the damaged items they sent to me.  GENERAL BOTTLE SUPPLY HAS THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER WITNESSED AND EXPERIENCED. BUT MY REP WAS VERY NICE . I WISH HE WAS THE OWNER.I BELEIVE  EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I made an order and I never got it. I talked to Claudia Rivas who is one of the managers and as someone that has been supporting this company for over 5 years, I am not happy with the customer service I received. They are not going to cover the missed merchandise and I am about $200 on a loss. Maybe this is a trustworthy place to purchase when we are picking up, but I would not order from them again if they have not ship anything. There have absolutely no protocol for missing packages.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

But my last visit no one helped me or said ‘hello’ when I came in. I had to ‘ask’ if there was an available agent to help me. And then when I did get helped, the lady that waited on me had a little attitude, not as helpful or even offered suggestions for a different product. Not crazy about the service this go round. The options for glass droppers and bottles are limited. I know next time which agent to use. But the managers there are very nice and helpful. Ask for one and you’re good to go!<//Review>< Pictures>

Right now, during Covid, I could only have my order shipped.  I had called in a few days ago and was waiting for a call back.  We did not get a call back.  Boo!  I found out that contrary to what the original person told me, the item was not backordered and the order had already gone in.  I believe the problem in customer service is that they are not very well computerized for efficiency.
What I do like is that we could pick up and save much money compared to the outfit we were dealing with in the MidWest.  Their shipping costs were outright robbery!<//text>

<Text>Very happy with my experience here. I came in with a specific bottle in mind, although they didn't have what I THOUGHT I wanted, they had what I really needed. The sales rep was very helpful, very courteous and very professional. I was able to buy what I needed and take my stuff home with me within a few minutes; they filled my order on site from their warehouse.<//Text><UserId.>117135875871289435948</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80c2c67a9c6b18d1:0x14b036e398ce43d8</gmap_id>< rate>

I needed samples of various different bottle types to customize the amount and size for my clients. When I asked them if they could do this they told me they could only do 3 samples. I told them that I really need more than 3 samples and they took an extremely long time to fulfill the order. Once the order was fulfilled they took an extremely long time getting the samples for me. I definitely spent over an hour in this entire process. Others who are regulars seem to know how long it takes to the point that one man actually played guitar in the parking lot to pass the time. Finally they bring out the samples and tell me that they do not have 3 of the items but they had already charged me for them. They refunded me but this took what felt like another hour.< /text>

<Text>I've always had excellent customer service and great pricing.
I've been using them for over a year and I find the best way to shop is to go online and browse, then you can talk with them about what you might want.  If you really have no clue, then you need to go into the store and touch and feel in person.
Love General Bottle Supply!</Text>< GmapID>

8 to 4 is definitely the worst hours to operate as a supplier only because our working hours run at the exact same time. It makes it harder to fulfill and pickup materials.

Being in the manufacturing business, we want that from a supplier. More time to conduct business = happy customers = more $$$, for all parties involved!

<user_name>hdb80<//user_name><Text>First off I will say that I've never ordered from this company. Why? Because I can't get anyone to answer my phone call or return my messages. Why would I order from a company that can't be bothered to answer my questions or even acknowledge my existence and need of their product in the first place? No thank you, the headache isn't worth the savings. Customer service and care is #1 in my book. I'll spend my money elsewhere.</Text><Rating>1<//Rating><Date>1438533301263< /Date><user>110048284652479653534<//user><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

They are never able to take my order by phone because they claim they are too busy. The part that is most inconvenient is that I always have to drive out there just to ask if they have the product I want in stock. Every time I call they are busy and they never get back to me when I leave my number. Complete waste of my time. Wished I could find the jars I want someplace else as this place does not deserve my business.</text>

Then, my wife and I have used their jars for home-made Christmas gifts.  Finally, in my current life running a non-profit organization, we use their jugs and pails in our water education program.

Worst customer service EVER. Before purchasing I was looking for some guidance and called this company because I was interested in a specific glass bottle they carry. Despite several attempts, I wasn't able to get a call or email back. I decided to still go ahead and purchase the bottles through the site. The confirmation page said I'd receive an email with my order confirmation (which I never did). Two days later, I call to get some info and their rep was so rude, just didn't have a decent attitude towards customers. Left me waiting for 10 minutes because he couldn't find my order. He didn't want to send me an order confirmation via email so I told him about my ordeal since first contact with his company and asked to cancel my order. He asked for my phone number (which he should have if he really had found my order) to call me "if anything" (still don't get what's so complicated about being professional and respectful..). Then to top it off, as I was asking for a confirmation of this cancellation, he hung up the phone on me. I have never been treated so rudely by "customer service". Can't stress this enough, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.</text>

I agree with Larisa, they never pick up the phone, never call me back and if you get lucky and they pick up they say that the rep will call me back because only the rep can take orders. Seriously? What a joke guys..< /review>

< review>
Although their prices are low, this is absolutely the worst customer service that I have ever experienced with a bottle vendor. There are plenty of professional bottle companies out there - GBS is not one of them. I called in for a quote. 2 weeks later they charged my card over $1700 and sent the order without my authorization. This at the end of the month when payroll, rent, and other business expenses are due. Ended up going to my bank to dispute the charges because the person who handles refunds is conveniently out of the office.<//review>

Awful customer service. Can never get my rep on the phone as I sit here and write this review. Only buy one item from them, but no one seems to be able to help me except for him. Only reason I use them are they are close by but am actively looking for another company to purchase from.</review>

<review>Ok so this was my first visit but I was skeptical due to the negative reviews. I walked in, there were people waiting, I told them specifically what I needed and I was out. Most of my waiting was at the dock. I was in a hurry since while at their store I got a call and I needed to leave quickly. The loading dock guys seem to be having too much fun and I had to wait a bit, but they could have gotten us taken care of quicker if they weren't horsing around. That was annoying but overall not a bad experience. I was particularly pleased when I see they hired a double minority: a trans black woman. That was pretty cool and shows they are a company who values diversity.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I believe they work at being the worst at customer service you don’t bet that horrible by accent.  You would think that since I use to order over $5K in bottles you would think they would treat me nice or at lease show me they wanted my business but rudeness and constant neglect of my account has caused me to only use them in an emergency and sometimes not even then.  I have tried to complain to upper management but they act like there listen and nothing ever change. I can’t see them staying in business over the long haul the way they treat their customers. I give them a no stars if I could.< /Text><name>Desreta Jackson<//name><response>None< /response>< date>

I'm a small startup company and they have helped me grow and stay consistent with my weekly product demands.
I think we have a bit of inpatient negative people posting on this board .the only thing I can say is maybe it takes a little long to get your order at the dock after paying  maybe 15-20 mins . Big freaking deal people ! They are a big company locating product and fulfillment process takes time with tons of orders coming in that's just how it is .</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>I have to concur with the other reviews here about weak customer service and general out-of-touch nature of their order and customer service phone team.  I have ordered probably a half dozen times from these guys and two times they processed the order online and charged my card without having product in stock. This is for items that were in stock on their website. Worse yet when I phoned days later to find out about my order and when it would ship, this is when they would say "we're out of stock", to which I reply "why didn't you call or email me?" and their response "we were just about to do that".  Right.
And don't expect the most friendly phone service either. It can range from okay to rather stiff & unfriendly.

This is not how you run a business. If your website doesn't handle real-time inventory, then it's either time to get a new website that does (like other suppliers) or get a better customer service department that is on top of this stuff to immediately alert the customer to a backorder, not wait for me to call first after you've charged my card & I've lost valuable days waiting for product. Every other bottle supplier I can think of in the USA has a website that handles inventory and will not allow you to place an order when stuff is out of stock. Heck GoDaddy has a shopping cart website with inventory control for $29/mo so its not like they can't afford it.   This is pure laziness or greed on the part of this company that either 1) doesn't want to deal with this issue, or 2) is content to take your order and run your card in hopes they can scramble to find product for you so they don't lose your business.  Bottom line, this is not a good practice and other bottle suppliers don't operate this way.
I will pay more to order from competitors knowing that I've got service included and I can count on product being shipped when ordered or being alerted otherwise.
One other thing - if you have a CPU order (customer pick up) plan on waiting, and waiting. Sure you'll save on freight but unless its a huge order it won't be worth your time hanging out in the parking lot amidst other customers waiting for the same thing. Also have not had this experience picking up elsewhere, will calls are usually quick and easy at most places without the long wait.
Management can post replies to these reviews all they want, but there's a reason people are saying the same thing over and over.

Great place if you're not in a hurry for product and don't require even average customer service.<//Review></record>

<rating>3</rating><review>Customer service is usually not reliable, and inventory is only replenished when product completely runs out, a shortcoming which usually leaves them unstocked on an item for at least a week and a half as opposed to ordering before their stock is completely dry. It seems like they're working with inferior tech on their backend inventory, which is dissapointing due to the fact that in 2016 there are quite a few ways to remedy this. We've gotten incorrect product three times in a row on same question about certain type of shrink wrap. All in all the size of their selection is their redeeming quality but don't expect what you need to be in stock when you need it.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2c67a9c6b18d1:0x14b036e398ce43d8< /GmapID>< pics>

ANyway, I looked through their website and I got super excited, and when I went to their store, I saw  something like 50 sq feet of  showroom. I was utterly disapointed.... I still got some jars because, you know I went there to get a quick sample but I also agree with previous raters. I have called and they have never picke up my calls. Someth that worries me...... Ever since then, I go to filmorecontainer  but I am willing to check others out if anybody has any suggestions.

Worst customer service I have ever had! After being a customer for over 7 years they sent me the wrong product and made me pay not only for the replacement but I had to pay shipping twice.

Best blood draw ever! Absolutely flawless. I walked in 10 minutes early, verified my appointment, and was called within 5  minutes and the blood draw (expertly done, I felt nothing) was over and I was out in another five!
Also, everyone was extremely polite and helpful.< /Text>

The worst business ever, lazy people, horrible service! I had many bad experiences with them and just came here again only because it was convenient for my doctor, no changes! Still horrible! Front desk lady gets super offensive if you ask questions because she’s busy on her computer, isn’t her job to answer questions? There are much better lab places to go to,  Don’t go there if you don’t have to...!< /text>

Horrible. Maybe they are understaffed but it was horrible. I was told a 5 minute wait but it turned out to be 1.5 hours!  Then the technician was awful and I ended up with tremendous pain and a tennis ball sized hematoma at the draw site in my arm. I am a healthy man and always told previously at other places I have  easy to see and access veins so I don’t know what her problem was. This was on June 5, 2020.< /text>

This entire place smells like bad breath. It’s musty and old looking. It gives off a vibe of “dirty” and “old”. The staff were nice enough, but I didn’t feel comfortable getting my blood drawn here because of the smell and shabbiness of the place. It made me feel like they might not be sanitary.<//text>

I read lots of negative reviews here, but as my doctor referred me to them I still ended up going there. To my surprise, everything was excellent. I didn't have an appointment but still only had to wait 10-15 minutes. You could sign in on a pad and it was even telling you estimated waiting time, which was accurate. Every interaction I had there was very nice, they were very friendly and professional.<//Text>

He did a painful blood  draw, more than needed,
put a big and unstable bandage, bleeding even after the job!

If I could, I would give this place a negative 10 star review.  The people that work here are rude to the customers and always make you feel like you are a burden for coming in.  They act like they are so superior to you, and are just overall rude.  They don't ever make you feel welcome, and if you ever have a question, they reply in a snappy tone with an attitude.  Every single time I have come here for a lab test, I have always had an issue.  They lost my sample once, and they accidentally spilled my sample twice, requiring me to come in again to put in another sample because of their mistake.  And, not to mention, the wait time is atrocious.  I almost had to wait for an hour just to give a sample in that would have only taken 2 minutes to do.  Even my doctor thinks that this place is a disaster.  Please fix these issues, as I am very disappointed in this place.  Their job is to help you get the samples in an efficient way, and not to make you feel angry every time after leaving the place.< /text>

I also had an excellent experience here. I arrived at 9am, and Alex at the front desk was very polite, kind, and helpful.

For the record, I came without an appointment. I only had my doctor's order with me and they were able to fit me in without much hassle.<//review>

I came here to get blood work done for my girlfriend. As she politely asked about the wait time, because I had a surgery to get to she was passively and rudely retorted by a white male at the front desk, if she can read because it is posted behind him on a screen. It was very appalling and I was completely disgusted by the man's lack of empathy for someone working in a medical field. And after that a woman came out to the lobby wearing her gloves holding a sample and got water from the public drinking tank. This place needs a completely new staff it is. For being so close to my home in Los altos I feel like I went to a quest diagnostics in EPA.< /Text>

Is there an option of giving negative stars I would have definitely opted that for this branch of Quest Diagnostics.
A young man whose name starts with C poked 4 times just to find out a vein of my six yr old to draw blood.
I dont know who hired this guy???
A real bad experience. I would definitely say  anyone  not to go to this branch for blood tests for sure.< /text>

I had terrible experience with this facility. I needed a STAT ( the same day test) and ensured it's a STAT order when checkin. The staff answered back coldly and said she knew it's a STAT. At the end, my doctor office had waited to the end of Sat and there's still no test result coming in. It totally messed up my treatment plan. How could a blood draw center treat patient's life and trust so lightly? I'll never go back to this center any more. If you need STAT test, this center is not a choice at all. This center seriously need a revamp!< /text>

<Text>Will never visit again. There was a lady with short hair who made me feel like i was an added burden on her and now that i am there, she has to provide me service 'unwillingly'. very very unfriendly. i was there for blood work of my almost 3 yr old girl, the older lady poked her in both arms but could not draw blood saying my girl moved a lot, even though two of us were holding her tight. Beware!! do not go there.< /Text>< Rate>

My experience was the exact opposite of those who posted negative reviews. I have nothing to gain in simply telling the truth. Everyone I met at this lab was very friendly and professional, especially the front desk receptionist. From the descriptions on the previous posts, I suspect there may have been some staff changes since the negative reviews were written. If you don't have an appointment, your best bet is to get there when the lab opens. I did not have one, and I waited 15 minutes.</Text>

The woman at the front desk( with short hair) is rude and sounds highly impatient to answer to anything. She should be replaced for there is no way one should speak or behave like that with customers. She needs therapy to calm down her attitude.</Review>

Sleep Consultant Mark Abbas at the Studio City location is the consummate professional, extremely helpful in making a complicated decision from so many choice quite easy.

After choosing a Casper Nova Hybrid, we were pleased to find out that it will arrive after being opened and aired out in the the warehouse, saving us from waiting for it to reach its full form.

Buying a mattress isn't something one does often, but it's good to know that a place like Sit n' Sleep does an excellent job in making customer satisfaction a priority .</text>

Amazing. Walked in completely clueless and overwhelmed with buying a mattress and Wayne Hargraves changed that. He was so helpful and made the process easier than I thought it would be. I felt like he was a family member who really wanted us to get the best experience and deal. Not pushy like some salespeople can be. Very caring. I wish I had more bedrooms to buy more mattresses from him! Cad I add an extra star rating??< /Text>

<text>This is an awesome place to buy everything you need to sleep great! Peter was very attentive and showed us many options according to our needs. They have a special machine that studies your body and tells you what type of mattress is best for you. We even got pillows and a mattress protector for my son's bed. Totally recommend.</text><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bdfb1c120665:0xc6690d775f13c1b5< /Gmap_id>< user>

Wonderful Store!!
The salesmen are so nice and friendly!
Very helpful, not at all pushy. They allow you to take your time before deciding on this big$ purchase.

Peter, Mark and the store manager each exceeded my expectations.
Will recommend to everyone!

They have an incredible price range of all kinds of mattresses.
And pillows and gorgeous sheets!
I didn't realize they also have really nice bedroom furniture.

P.S. the entire shopping experience was very, very safe!
They give each customer a personal thick papered sheet for safety while trying the beds. And each customer has their temperature taken before entering store. Everyone stays at a safe distance as well.<//Text>

Booked appointment and was helped right away. Hand sanitizer, temp check, and mattress cover were provided immediately. Maintained social distance with other customers entire time. Great selection. Super helpful, professional, and friendly staff. Check out was easy and looking forward to the delivery.<//Text>

<review>Excellent shopping experience. Wayne did a great job explaining how mattresses differed from each other and gave us plenty of time to “test drive” as many as we wanted. This made us very confident in the mattress we chose.< /review>< Name>

My trusted chiropractor of 20 yrs directed me to the Studio City Sit N Sleep and it was such a supportive suggestion. Mark Abbas from the store spent countless hours with me patiently educating me on the best options for neck and back. He is the mattress genius of Los Angeles. He came across more as a mattress broker vs a salesman. I can’t wait to get my new mattress and I was referring him new clients on my phone while he was still ringing my purchase up for me.< /text>

Thank you thank you thank you for Wayne. He helped my girlfriend and I find a bed for us. This review is Primarily for customer service as we yet to receive our new bed and try it out. Over the top customer service the moment we walked in to the time we left. Sit and sleep is lucky to have such a great person on their team. Thank you Wayne!< /review>

He's completely and thoroughly knowledgable regarding his inventory and what would be the best choice for me with what I needed.

Peter was very helpful. Although I had no intention of getting an adjustable bed he kept pulling out those remotes and showing me, without a word, how beneficial being able to raise my head or my legs would be on my joints. Since the whole reason I was getting a new mattress was because of my achy joints upon waking it dawned on me he was doing me a favor. After choosing a mattress I realized it would be irrational not to take advantage of what I always thought was silly technology. His no pressure sales allowed me to overcome my objections myself. I realized that taking pressure off my joints, especially my hips, would make my mornings much more pleasant. I had visited a few mattress stores on the weekend but Sit n Sleep was the only store that could deliver my new bed right away. The other stores all had a two to three week delivery time due to COVID. So glad I went in. I don’t generally write reviews, especially long ones, but obviously, this one is deserved.<//review>

<Review>My boyfriend and I just bought a bed from Peter. Best sales person my boyfriend and I have come across. He knew what he was talking about when ever question was asked.

Peter and Wayne were consummate pros.
We never felt pressured.  Tried a bunch of beds.
We just dawdled and were in no hurry.

Nickie has gone in early so we wanted to make sure Peter-who had helped her then-got the sale.
Super friendly.  Knowledgeable. Let us do our thing.

We bought the infinity king. I guess we should do a review after a year or so...

But the process itself?  Pain free.  Closing the sale took no time.  Lifetime guarantee.  They take away the old mattress.  Year of 0% financing.

Love.</text>

And the sleep test analysis for the correct mattress is wonderful - I’ve been struggling for years trying 3-4 different types of mattress. Looks like all were too firm for me. The hybrid we purchased -2 of them we liked it so much, feels like you’re getting a hug when you get in. It’s amazing and the cool sleep I have a feeling will be great for the hotter months here in Southern Cali.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Thank you Peter for helping me choose the right mattress for me. Because of your professional advice, I finally woke up without having the permanent pain in my back.
I had an amazing shopping experience at Sit ‘n Sleep and I would recommend this location to everyone.< /review>

Wayne was awesome! I loved the sleep test he had my boyfriend and I do in the beginning of our visit. Then he led us through 4-5 mattresses to narrow down our options that fit the results of the test. Super friendly and professional, not pushy, great customer service, and helped us get the best deal.  Thanks Wayne! We can’t wait for our new bed to arrive!!!</Review>

The experience at the sit n sleep in studio was very high quality. Starting with finding out the exact customized support that I need for my body when it comes to a bed. My partner and I were helped by Wayne Hargraves who not only showed us a variety of beds but was also very knowledgeable about everything related to choosing a bed. Wayne also made sure to ask for our price range which helped me make my purchase. Sit n sleep also was the only mattress store that I went to that had a great safety policy in terms of COVID-19 by not only having hand sanitizer but bed covers for customers to lay on beds. I look forward to using my purchase mattress and bed frame for years to come.<//review>

I walked into the store and the sales person, Kat, allowed me to come in, take a look around and then approached me and asked if she could help me. It was a pleasure to not be pressured. She listened to what I was looking for and then described to me the different types of mattresses. She then led me to the Bed Match diagnostic system that matches you with the mattresses best suited for your body type and sleep position. Kat brought me to each mattress I was matched with, describing the brand, type and construction, etc. She asked me to lay down for as long as I liked, leaving me alone to assume my “sleep position”, but always keeping an eye on me for when I would sit up or if I had a question for her. Kat is extremely knowledgeable, knowing every product she introduced me to. She answered all of my questions, gave me room to go back and forth between mattresses and never pressured me for a decision. I chose the mattress I wanted, asked her about the pillows, and after her answer, I asked her to include 2 in my purchase. She offered the mattress protector and cover, telling me what it does and why it’s a good idea. She gave me a discount on the cover and included covers for my pillows. I made the purchase and look forward to my mattress and pillows being delivered. I am extremely pleased with the service I received from Kat. I highly recommend her to anyone looking to purchase a quality mattress from a quality store with a high quality sales person who will handle you with courtesy and respect.< /review>

We were pleasantly surprised with our experience at Sit 'n Sleep. Our salesperson, Kat Allin, was very helpful, having us start with the store's space age bed measurement and comfort system. Once it had determined what type of bed we needed (firm), she showed us matching beds. These beds were way above our price range so we asked about less expensive ones. She took us upstairs and showed us some options. She left us to talk to other customers, checked on us every once in a while, and once we had chosen the bad we wanted, she helped us with bed covers and pillows. The best part? Our new bed is being delivered the next day (Sunday). Very convenient and timely. We highly recommend Kat and Sit 'n Sleep. (No, Larry was not there.)< /Text>

<review>Extremely friendly, laid back,fully answers questions and the place/beds were clean. My wife and I dreaded the up coming bed shopping experience. This was our first stop(word of mouth and Woody Show) and should of just stop here. This location was friendly(shout out to Wayne Hargaves).  Wayne was laid back  showed us the sleep technology test a few beds after the results what to look for and let's us explore the store plus answered all questions we had even returned email prominently. Like I said we should of just stayed here but we looked at other places which had dirty stained beds, creepy salesmen hovering there while were laying down asking odd questions and not really answering questions the we asked. So I highly recommend this Sit N Sleep!</review><user_name>Capodon Yeti</user_name>< Time>

We came into the Studio City Store in a panic because my Mom needed a new bed by the next day. The store manager Wayne Hargraves was so helpful. He was even able to help my Mom stick with her price range, because that’s hard for her! Lol The best part was I was also able to get a new bed! Thanks Wayne you ROCK!!!< /Review>

I am impressed with the concern and flexibility demonstrated by my salesman, Peter, He did not try to pressure me into purchase of unintended items, and provided me with excellent pricing and service.  My only complaint is that my preferred mattress was out of stock, and I would have had to wait 5 days for delivery.  Peter helped me find a good alternative.Thank You.<//Review>

<Review>After having a not great experience at the Sherman Oaks store yesterday we decided to give it another go at a different location. Waking away we got everything we needed and more way less than the other store even tried to do. I understand sales, I’m in it, but there’s a line of being too pushy. Peter at Studio City let us make our own decision on our own time and we left feeling we got the best deal. The worst part...waiting till Saturday for that perfect sleep!!< /Review>< rate>

I have been to 6 different mattress stores in two days.  I found a number of beds that would be okay, but none that I was thrilled with, until today at Sit N Sleep.  I just got an incredible deal on an amazing floor model bed.  Couldn't be happier.<//Text>

< Review>
I won't lie, the mattress we ended up with is very comfortable. That being said, the experience of buying it wasn't great. We felt very pushed towards the more expensive models, despite saying several times we liked a cheaper one. And they were very big on the upsell for the mattress protector and ventilation boards. As it turns out we don't actually need the ventilation boards, and their return policy for everything but mattresses is no-returns. So, next time I'll probably be going online.</Review>

On her suggestion, we tried the Bes Match device and found our ranges to consider and we are off to trials of different mattresses. We explained to he that while we liked a few of them, that we were going to try a few others for comparison and she couldn’t have been more friendly about our decision and invited us back after other trials. Her knowledge of our existing bed and sleeping discomforts were very confidence inspiring.

After trying others, we gladly came back to complete an excellent purchase. She’s the best.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1525110150831, 'text': "Thank you so much for this thoughtful feedback, Jim.

<Review>We had the most amazing experience at this store. My girlfriend and myself must have tested every mattress in the store and tested our favorite four about fifty times each. Peter, our sleep consultant, couldn’t have been nicer. He worked with us with all of our questions and concerns. The price we paid was better than any other place. For the quality that we got, the price that we paid, and the customer service that we received I couldn’t be happier nor could I recommend this store any more for your mattress needs.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>My partner and I went to Sit n Sleep about a year ago and tried a few mattresses. We were taken with the Sherwood Dunlopillo mattresses, but were just shopping and not ready to buy.  We went back two weeks ago and we were helped by Peter Jenkins, who was very helpful without being pushy or hard sell at all. Unfortunately, the Sherwood Sanctuary mattress that we liked from before was no longer for sale there, but Peter offered to special order it for us, and we thanked him, but went on to visit 3 other stores in the area before going back to Peter and buying the Sherwood mattress on special order. He gave us a great deal, was never aggressive or pushy, and we left totally happy. We took delivery of the bed today and it's wonderful. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect bed for us. Peter was a great help and if I manage to live long enough to need another bed, I will definitely look him up, and I highly recommend him and Sit n Sleep to anyone who is looking for a great new bed without the car dealer haggling that you find at other stores.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I went in to the store very confused after looking online for a new mattress.   I was greeted right away by Peter.  I told him how I was confused and he told me he would explain everything to me.  He went over the different types of mattresses and then put me on a test bed where I answered a survey.  After I was done, the machine told me the best firmness for me.  I was a red firm.  Peter showed me the different options and was patient with me while my son and I tried the multiple beds.  After going back and forth I decided to go with a Technogel Armonia gel mattress.   It is being delivered tomorrow and I cannot wait.  I never write reviews, but I had to say how awesome the experience was.  It is an investment to me as sleep is so important.   Thanks Peter!</text>< pics>

Amazing place! We were instantly greeted and given fabulous customer service. We tried out several different mattesses, but knew immediately when we found “the one!” There was no pressure or pushy sales pitch. David Burgeron got us a great deal when we bundled our bed with a bed frame. And we have free delivery scheduled for the next day. We couldn’t be happier with our experience!!<//Review>

It was a very good purchase and Matt is a terrific rep for Sit & Sleep.<//review><response>{'time': 1525109309545, 'text': "Thanks for the feedback, Cheryl.

The salesman (Dave) was very pleasant to deal with and very well versed regarding the “world of fine mattresses”.  He made the whole process easy for both my wife and I.  We highly recommend Dave to anyone interested in the purchase of a  mattress that will meet their specific needs.<//Review>

My family and I thought it was time to buy an  RV. We ended up buying from Camping World. Prices are competitive and the buying process quick and easy. RVs shown by appointment and you are able to see as many as you need. We were not pressured into choosing. We chose what was right for our family size and needs. I recommend you look into them when you are ready to buy and also recommend you take a look at their inventory online.<//Review>

Alan Light is an excellent person. He has a great customer service and showed us the RVs that met our requirements. As well as helped us to acquire our new RV. I would say that choosing Camping World was a great decision. I highly recommend this place.<//text>

Steve assisted us with the best costumer service and answered all the questioned we had, he showed us trailer we were only interested in within our price range. Smooth process.

<Review>My husband and I have been shopping for a new fifth wheel for over a year.  Our requirements were a little unique, as I needed a functioning office space because I work from home.  Also, this is going to be my husband's home for 5 days out of the week for the next 4 months, so we wanted a rig that was rated for full-time living.  Most of the rigs we saw may have had a bonus room, but the desk space was too small, or there were too many steps between the living room, down to the kitchen, back up to the bedroom and bathroom.  We're not old, but going up and down like that does take a toll on your knees.  Also, I wanted the solid stairs in and out of the rig, so that was consideration as well.

We had finally settled on a Keystone Montana 3854BR that has a bonus room w/ loft and outside kitchen.  It had residential appliances, theater seating, a full couch that can pull out into a bed, a love seat in the office which can also pull out into a bed, and full wall-to-wall desk - what a luxury!   When we finally went to find one, most of the RV dealers didn't have that model in stock.  We found one at Camping World in Bakersfield.  It had all the extras we wanted, including a king bed and a tow-hitch for the travel trailer.  My husband contacted them and worked with Virgil to negotiate a great price.  The best part?  Virgil even took our calls during his day off.  That's service.  Once we put the $500 down to secure the rig, I worked with Leesa for the financing.  She gave us all the information, and negotiated an excellent interest rate, lower than the one our credit union was offering.

The day we went to pick up the rig, it was cleaned and Bennie in service provided us excellent instruction about the ins and outs of the rig.  He was patient, knowledgeable, and his team fixed the small nits I pointed out right there and then.  Trust me, we went over that rig with a fine toothed comb - testing all the gadgets, the lights, the pop-outs, and my husband toured the roof and examined the exterior, the storage space, the mechanics of the rig very carefully.  Bennie didn't blink an eye, and was happy to help us with all of our questions and concerns.

When we went to financing with Leesa, she was very friendly, very patient with all our questions, very honest and upfront about what were responsible for, what the warranty covered and how long the warranty was good for.  The discrepancy between the packages was minimal given the excellent interest rate she negotiated, so we went with the platinum package warranty.

The Camping World at Bakersfield also has a full-service store, and we were able to get sheets and other essentials for the rig before we left.  We had a great experience with the crew and staff at this Camping World location.  No one pushed us into a sale, Virgil did not call us constantly and Leesa was responsive to my emails before we arrived at the site.  Other dealers had their sales people call and text us mercilessly, and while I understand they want to make a sale, they have to understand that spending $80K is a big decision and needs to be thought through carefully.  I felt the staff at Camping World Bakersfield understood this and provided us the time and comfort to make that decision while still being available to answer all our questions until final sale.  It was important to us to find a dealer that we felt comfortable with because we anticipate upgrading or purchasing at least one more rig in the future, and I'm glad to know we can come back to Camping World Bakersfield to get the kind of personal customer service we desire to find the perfect rig.  Thank you.<//Review>< Name>

<Text>When looking for any type of RV and Trailer you need to look at Camping World - Bakersfield. Every step of the process everyone at Camping World was amazing. Started off with Glenn that found us the perfect trailer that checked the box of all of our needs.Then Leesa with Financing was great! Got us the best possible deal. For orientation Benny was great! Took his time to walk us through everything and answered our onslaught of questions. Then the ladies upfront were great making sure when that every step was taken care of. I even had a great experience with parts with them installing a TV mount in the bedroom of our trailer. Since this was my first purchase of a trailer I don’t know much of how it worked before buying it so we stayed across the street at the RV park to test it out. Had a little trouble with the hitch so Glenn and Benny came over and showed us how to hook everything up and made sure we were all set before the left. The customer service was amazing every step of the way. The best part of it all was everyone’s personality. Felt like everyone was our best friend there they were so nice. You will not regret buying your RV or Trailer from Camping World Bakersfield!! Thank you everyone that helped us and made our experience amazing!! John and Lizzie S!<//Text>< user_id>

<review>The entire staff at Camping World of Bakersfield are terrific! We we’re getting ready to move out of state and decided to look into selling our trailer rather than pull it 1400 miles. We called Barry’s and Camping World and after experiencing Kelly Lopes at Camping World it was an easy decision.
In my 54 years on this earth, regardless of if I were buying a car, a cell phone.... whatever, he gave me the best customer service I have ever experience. I need to be more like Kelly !!
Thank you to everyone at Camping World.</review>< pics>

I've gotta say, my experience at CW was great. Rita was very helpful and knowledgeable. When making a purchase of something like a motorhome, you expect for the associates to be professional. Well my expectations were met. Thank you Rita for the professionalism and being so courteous, and knowledgeable. Great experience!!!<//review>

We recently purchased a new Montana high country 294rl from Camping World of Bakersfield. Our experience there was outstanding. This was our third RV purchase and first from Camping World of Bakersfield. Our Sales representative Glenn was great, easy to work with and we were able to make a deal with no issues. Troy the finance manager was also great to work with. We quickly completed the deal and were on our way with our new Fifth Wheel.</Text>

All of the staff at Camping World are extremely knowledgeable and professional, but my salesman, Alan, was truly an expert. He was able to answer all of my RV questions without pressuring me to buy. If you are in the market for an RV, I highly recommend Alan at Camping World Bakersfield.<//Review>

<Text>This place is a joke! Do not buy anything here ever!!! There customer service is horrible.  Once they sell you something they wash there hands. I bought a Coleman pit bike from there. The next day stopped working called to have warranty looked at and they said they don't service them at all send me to Coleman. Then Coleman gives me permission to fix the vehicle but tells me there's no place in town to fix it. So I called back Camping World and they tell me they can't help me so they sold me a bike that they can't fix or repair if it breaks. And on another note went on a waiting list for a Coleman trailer in July ended up having to buy a different trailer in January because still couldn't get their trailer I ordered. This place has been a nightmare from the first day I walked into it and it gets worse and worse and worse after you buy. Best advice I could give is drive to another dealership out of Bakersfield because this one sucks</Text></record></dataset><record>

<date>1614040204289</date><Review>Purchased a new Jayco 5th wheel unit recently.  Our sales person, Steve Kane, was great. He was very knowledgeable about the unit and spent a considerable amount of time showing us the unit.  After we purchased the unit he even gave my kids personalized gifts for the bunkhouse.

Leesa from finance made this process quick and easy.  No high pressure to buy the extras.  She was honest and open.  Complete opposite then what you get when you buy a car.  She got us a great rate too.

Bennie did our orientation and did a great job explaining how everything worked.  The mechanic who installed our hitch gave us great tips on proper tire pressure and hitching.

I had a small issue with my auto leveling.  I called Art in service and he spent 15 minutes walking me through the reset process and got it working without the need to bring it in.

Our experience was great from start to finish.< /Review>< Rating>

< review>
Went in here to get a few things for our new motor home, we asked like 4 different people for help. One said, I do work here but you have to ask them for help, while he was literally just standing there for the past 5 minutes. Asked a few more and went to go show us & just pointed & left. We thought they were going to go show us where we can find additional ones, but nope they just like disappeared. We found about 2 things we needed, but after getting treated like this, we left it & walked out. There was like at least 10 employees standing by the front & NO ONE offered to help. OR say, thank you, have a good day, NOTHING!
If you work in customer service, do your job! A smile goes a long way. Sad to say majority of all of these workers are grown adults, but still no manners.<//review>

I always feel like I can find a better deal elsewhere and last time I was here, they didn't even have drinking water hoses.</review>

Overall it was a positive experience and your representatives in the parts department were always courteous and prompt in their response.... I don’t necessarily understand why it takes six weeks to get a part from the manufacturer (especially when you can get just about anything from Amazon in a few days), but I’m guessing that’s the way it’s always been done.... Maybe someone could work on that weak link in your chain of services! 🤗< /text>

I have to say...our buying experience at Camping World Bakersfield was very pleasant. Not only was our salesman Mark Pedroza friendly and knowledgeable, but very helpful finding the right deal for us. Our experience with the finance department was also great. Troy was also very friendly and helpful. I give our overall experience 5 stars, we had NO glitches😊<//Text>

We had started a GoFundMe to help buy a trailer to help a family friend that has a daughter that was in a terrible accident. Camping World heard about it and stepped right up to donate a toy hauler and everything needed to furnish it and make it ready to use. This generous donation makes it possible for her family to stay at the hospital that has full hook up sites, that’s out of town, so that they can be with her for the several months of rehabilitation that she’s going to need. Everyone from the corporate office, to the local CW, Eric, Bob, and their entire staff has been so incredible in helping us take care of this family. I cannot express how much they have helped to change many lives in the process and highly recommended them to anyone looking to buy a trailer in the future!<//Review>

<review>On December 2nd I purchased this in stock RV toilet thinking that camping world would ship ASAP...WRONG!!  Received the toilet on December 21st. Bottom line is if you need a item fast DON’T buy from camping world. With this company it’s all about money not customer service. It’s no wonder Amazon  is #1 in fast shipping and customer service. With this COVID-19 epidemic going on you would think theses companies would put customer service and shipping as first priority since the public is not allowed inside their buildings and not offering curbside pick up. I’m am so sorry but this was my last purchase from camping world. Camping world management needs to take a lesson a small lesson from Amazon.😞</review><GmapID>0x80ea6aa25aaa8863:0xa63d24d0ac675ba8< /GmapID>< userid>

I can’t say enough good things about my experience here at Camping World of Bakersfield. From the minute I submitted my request for info on a camper, which I purchased on Monday, the customer service has been exceptional. My salesman Steve contacted me right away to set up a virtual tour of the coach I was interested in and gave me a thorough walk through answering all questions and concerns I had. I received a phone call from Tracey to make sure I was still interested and set up a time to come in on Monday to finish sales paperwork and do the orientation on the coach. I arrived much earlier than expected, they thought I was going to be there at 3pm and I arrived shortly after opening, but they were able to accommodate quickly. Bob helped me out and had one of the service techs Dave give me the orientation on my trailer. He did and outstanding job seeing as it was his first one and Bob put him on the spot. No holes in his game. Thorough walk through and gave me extra pointers for things to watch out for to troubleshoot if necessary. To finish off the day I met with Lisa in finance. She came in on her day off to help me which I can’t thank her enough. She made the process so smooth and easy and was just a delight to work with.
Overall this was some of the best customer service I’ve had. Everyone working there was attentive, helpful, and just awesome. I can’t wait to get my trailer delivered! I highly recommend them for all your camping needs.</text>

<Review>It's the middle of covid lockdown and these guys would not offer curbside pickup for some parts. Not only that, but they would not allow us to pay by credit card so that we did not have to spend additional time in the store. Obviously, that is their right as a private business. But if they care that little about their customers' health and safety, I can only imagine how little they would care about taking care of their customers in other ways. We excercised our right to shop somewhere else.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Great experience buying my first trailer. Angel was very helpful and was able to answer all my questions at anytime of the day. Only showed me trailers I wanted to see and didn't try to oversell. Troy in the finance department was also a great help. Going to recommend them to anyone looking to get a trailer/rv.< /Text>

< review>
I wanted to express my sincere appreciation to all of you for the recent repair of our kid’s Coleman trailer.  (toilet and awning issue)

We have personally had 4 units of our own, all purchased here on the Central Coast and Fresno, and I tell you, my dealings with service have always been below standard.

When we found out about this issue,  (2 days after the warranty expired), I was already bummed, and began to get frustrated as I felt this is going to be another one of those situations where they are going to keep the trailer longer than scheduled, and/or do a poor repair job.

We delivered the trailer to Bakersfield CW it on Thursday, and by Saturday it was completed and we drove to Bakersfield to pick it up.

We all appreciate this service, and my daughter even mentioned “It’s great to know that CW is true to their word”   I told her I have to admit, I agree !

By the way, during pickup  "EDDIE" was great.<//review>

They were pretty busy.  Salesman (Mark) was very knowledgeable and was able to show us trailers, however, he didn't maintain wearing face covering and we saw quite a few employees and customers not engaging in safe Covid-19 practices.< /Text>

We bought our Jayco travel trailer here in Aug 2019 and had a great experience. I base my experience on not if there “were” troubles but “when” there are troubles how they’re resolved and I’m very happy how things worked out. Bryan T. , Leesa S. & Stephanie were great to deal with over the phone email and text. Thank you for going out of the way to facilitate our needs.</Text>

To start my experience Alan my salesman was exceptionally knowledgeable pleasant and easy to deal with no pressure. He provided me with all the information I needed to make the proper purchase. As for the rest of the team from the service center to the receptionist as you first walk in the door what an outstanding team. Camping World of Bakersfield made this the most Pleasant purchase I've ever had and I thank you

Called to see if they have the seal we needed, guy on the phone says "I don't think so, we just do bearing repacks". So... like.... check your inventory, right? So we assume if they do repacks they likely have seals in case one breaks. He agrees, says come on down, we'll compare. Get there and they manage to find them, so at least that was a win. We ask if they have the bearing, he says he isn't sure and asks the guy next to him. Guy next to him says, "I don't think so" and leaves it at that. Like what?? I asked, so do you not have them or you don't think you have them because those are two different things. He just looks at me stupid and doesn't answer.  3 stars because the original guy was friendly and had our parts.<//text>

<review>Wow!!  We were so impressed by our experience.  We drove through Death Valley (124 degrees) and suddenly our propane tank began to hiss.  After some research we figured it was probably the regulator.  Without an appointment Steve was hopeful he could get us on the schedule.  As luck would have it the part was not in stock. Of course, we were extremely disappointed but agreed we’d head back home.  Not 3 minutes later Steve returned with news they’d found a part that would work!!  It is rare to find genuine people who care.  We will always visit Camping World with our RV needs.

Sales service was terrible. Steve Taylor literally abandoned us and dismissed us and walked away. Handed me a card and said call me if you have questions and went on to help another couple. The units were locked and it was a waste of time. Saw a great Mercedes that I would have LOVED to negotiate a fair price on. Definitely will not be purchasing from camping world!</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I'm editing my initial remarks after discovering that Camping World is in no way responsible for misleading me about a capture plate issue that I had with my newly installed Pull-Rite 5th wheel hitch. I insisted that Rodney Cruz was trying to CYA regarding this issue, but it turns out that Pull-Rite had not updated their website, consequently their information was misleading. I was very angry when I wrote the initial review and would like to apologize to Mr. Cruz, Mr. Gatson, and Mr. Barry for my misdirected anger. If I were in the market for a new RV, I would definitely recommend Camping World.

<username>Elizabeth DiMola</username><date>1571529015019< /date><Rating>5</Rating><review>Steve Taylor is amazing! If you have any interest in purchasing an RV he should be your first (and I promise you he will end up being your only) call. I purchased my first travel trailer and had tons of questions! He took the time to answer all of them. He was easy to get a hold of quick to respond too. I was very nervous about someone pushing me into something I was ready for. The old “used car salesman” was a lot of who I found out there until finding Steve, he made me feel comfortable and LISTENED to what we needed from my first call. I’m so happy I made my way to Bakersfield for the experience he provided. After we purchased, Bennie at Camping World, did our walk through and helped us understand our trailer before leaving the lot. Again, they made us feel at ease and like family. Don’t waste your time with anyone else, head to the pro!!</review>< Pics>

<Text>I purchased a gas fire pit at Camping World in Bakersfield, upon using the fire pit I discovered that the igniter did not work and I took the bottom off the unit to inspect it. I found the wire physically broken off the bottom of the igniter and contacted the manufacturer as noted in the literature. After several emails back-and-forth I was informed that the parts were on back order with no ETA on when they would arrive and they said to go back and exchange the unit. Unfortunately for me that's about a 2 hour and a 1/2 drive each way. I called the store and spoke to Lori Wiggins, she went above and beyond helping me. She checked inventory at her store and another one only an hour or so from me, none in stock. Then she called me back and said she had one that was returned for another reason and she would find time to take it apart and send me the parts I needed. To say that I am happy is an understatement, I have already ordered some other items from Camping World due to Lori's great service and will be a loyal customer.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80ea6aa25aaa8863:0xa63d24d0ac675ba8</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have checked prices, makes, models, build quality, and have spoken to some very knowledgeable people at different locations. My wife and I came to Camping World in Bakersfield to do some more research and was introduced to Virgil Swartz. We told Virgil what our preferences were and he showed us some models they had in stock and found the trailer we were looking for at a price we could not pass up. Thank you Virgil and the rest of you who helped us at Camping World.   Joe and Teresa, Happy Campers.< /review>< username>

Camping World and Bakersfield in my opinion is one of the most professional shops I’ve ever been to. Not only were we treated with extreme courtesy but the staff went out of their way to help us even though we had problems with our unit.
I especially want to thank Don Garcia the collision advisor at Camping World in Bakersfield as he went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of the best we could. I would not hesitate to use them again even though it’s almost 160 miles round-trip from where we live to their facility.< /Text>

This was our second visit. During both visits there was not enough gas in the motor homes to start them. It was so hot in the motor home that my daughter became ill. In the Camping World building the salesman did not keep social distance when he had plenty of room to stand six feet away.
I called ahead and was told that the motor home would be gassed up. Very unprofessional. Disappointing. We drove all the way from Taft.</review>

My husband and I had never purchased any type of RV and never camped. We went to Camping World of Bakersfield and Glenn Osgood showed us exactly what we were looking for and answered any questions we had.  We didn't feel rushed or pressured.  Everyone at Camping World was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant.  When we went to pick up our RV, we found a couple of things that needed attention, and within a short period of time they had it repaired and we were on our way.  If you are looking to purchase an RV or just get an idea of what you want, I would definitely recommend Camping World of Bakersfield.</text>

< Review>
To those who know me know that I'm not a very easy person to please.. With that said. I would like to share with you my experience at"Camping World of Bakersfield". First of all, our sales person (Angel) was most helpful and courteous, he help us find exactly what wanted in an RV. The finance department did a great job in securing our financing with a great rate. The general manager (Eric) when beyond call of duty but organizing the purchasing and the installation of addition devices we requested (Cameras, hitches, etc...) If you are looking for an RV, this the place to go.< /Review>

My husband and I drove out to Camping World in Bakersfield to look into getting into a Class C Motorhome that we had seen online. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted at the door and the gentleman that greeted us went and had our salesman Mark Pedroza come out to meet us. Very personable, knew his product, asked us what our goals were and took us out to see the Class C that was of interest. Loved it and went in to chat about “the deal”. We told him about our trade and what our goals were and he immediately got to work helping us to get into that particular rig. While we were not able to seal the deal, The vibe at this Camping World was very welcoming and made us feel like a part of their camping family. I would highly recommend this Camping World facility for a future purchase of a Motorhome, Trailer or any other camping needs!

Went today with my In-laws to get an idea of what we are going to buy in January and we had a great experience. I'm drawing a blank on the name of the man who helped us but I'll update it when I remember. He was very helpful and extremely knowledgeable! Thank you very much!<//Review>

I was in the market for an RV since I travel around the United States fairly often. It has a really selection of recreational vehicles and the staff is very friendly. He salesman was friendly as well and was not pushy at all. I really appreciate their help at this location and I highly recommend them for your needs.</text>

As a driver and delivering trailers from Camping World, Bakersfield to Lakeview Terrace for FEMA was a pleasure. Working with Big Bob and his team was very up lifting for all of us drivers.Bob and team worked so smoothly and vigorously getting unit out of there dealership, that Indiana Transport nor the FEMA team couldn't get there system working fast enough for  Big Bob nor any of us drivers.Most important he kept everyone distant and protected. Thanks Big Bob, you're a very good team leader and a pride I know for Camping World. God Bless all of you<//Text>

Eric and Bob Barry along with there entire team worked like a well oiled machine during a very busy and stressful time. To get everyone’s needs met in a timely manner . The transition was smooth and prompt keeping my waiting time to a minimum. Everyone greeted me with a hello and a smile exhibiting a high standard of professionalism. I would highly recommend them. Thanks for your hard work.

Drew Campos was amazing to work with. He went above and beyond to make sure that we received the best service while we were looking to purchase a motorhome. He was the reason that we decided to purchase with Camping World. His knowledge of all the motorhomes that we looked at was helpful in our decision.</text>

<Review>Just want to say thank's to Rick in sales for helping out on my purchase of a used 38 ft Travel  Supreme Diesel pusher! Had to wait for the coach to get a few things checked out but they did a great job! I had been so busy with work and waiting to get things done!  Bob the owner was very personal and kept me in the loop on what was going on and said I want to make this right! They even delivered the coach to me! Great experience thanks again Camping World of Bakersfield! I have referred you guys to a few friends! P.S! Just took coach out to local beach camping and worked as it should! Lot's of compliments!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Where do I start?
Based on service alone I wouldn’t buy a coach here!!! Look at other RV places!
I have a brand new Jayco Baja, that was there almost 3 months!!!!!!! Brand new.
During the 3 months it sat in the yard across the street and was vandalized
When brought to their attention the damage that was done to the coach.
Lame response was,  “Yes we had some problems with break ins”.  No apology, no what can we do for you. Can we replace your stained bedding? Can we redo your locks that we’re bent? Nothing.
Prior to that visit I took in for a fix, while diagnosing they broke molding and didn’t order it with the part they needed to fix so I had to wait even longer for the fix.
No urgency on repairs- I know it takes time to do fixes but 3 months?!?!?
Horrible communication with manufacturer/owner
HORRIBLE.

What they get a 5 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
Rating at, is great BS!!! Repair department is never up front with you.
I would have to be desperate to take my coach back there for horrible rotten bad service.
2 ⭐️ ⭐️ because they have popcorn in the sales room that is good to eat while you shop.

Save yourself time, money, and the headache buy someplace else or use a different repair shop!</Review>

Our purchase experience was very pleasant, Randy Perkins ours sales guy was great. He showed us so many different units, we changed our minds several times... anyways, we found a great rig at a great clearance price. Would recommend Camping World Bakersfield because of their selection, and don't forget to ask for Randy.< /text>

<text>I was convinced my family’s plans to spend Christmas in Big Bear were ruined due to a furnace that failed 1 week prior to our planned vacation.  I am glad Camping World of Bakersfield proved me wrong and the plans to spend Christmas in Big Bear are still on.  I can’t thank the entire service team enough for going the extra mile to get my rv furnace back up and running on such short notice.  I was treated so professionally during the entire process.   Choosing to bring my rv to Camping World for repairs was the best decision I could have made!!  Great group of people to work with and I would without hesitation recommend Camping World of Bakersfield for any service needs!<//text>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Just got home after purchasing a pre-owned Class A motorhome and I couldn't be happier. Even though I live about 150 miles from Bakersfield, Brian Timmins made the process and experience simple. I found the coach I liked and worked with Brian to work out the sales price, options and the value of my trade in over the phone, before seeing the coach in person. Brian even came in on his day off to show me the coach and demonstrate the features.

I highly recommend Camping World of Bakersfield and if/when I upgrade, this will be my first stop.

<Text>Angel is Super Star Sales Representative of your organization and needs to be recognized as a skilled, Caring and Professional not to mention a great asset to the Camping World of Bakersfield.

Because of his treatment, when our company will billed 235+ houses in Tehachapi I will bring all of our new home buyers business to Angel, Tracey, Stephanie and Leesa.

Only because there are a lot of dealers and trailers available but Angel was never pushy and he is a people person and that's what it sells in this market.

He is talented, educated with high level of product knowledge and exceptionally good at providing a top quality customer service.

If your company is interested about the potential of opening a new service facility in Tehachapi, CA with a high possibility of having a great R.O.I. in order to establish a future full capacity Sales Office and showroom please contact your sales manager, Tracey and I would be more than glad to share you my information.

Frankly I firmly believe if your company would ever entertain that idea, Angel will make a great Sales Manager to make the new location a flagship store with High profits!

Feel free to call me for free consultation.

Warm Regards,
Alex Emdadi<//Text>< Rating>

<text>We came on a great day! St. Patrick's day weekend sale and a surprise of hidden green envelopes in the RVs with gift certificates! We even found one for $250 and while spending this money there, we had the worst experience from a lady named Lori with a purple stripe. Miserable lady with terrible customer service, and even worse communication skills. She was very rude to us the few times we spoke with her and she knew we were unhappy. The front desk girls were fantastic though. Great bunch of ladies there. You were both awesome. But Lori was horrible. Dont think we will buy our RV from Camping World because of our experience.

<time>1561422805524<//time><rating>5</rating><Review>My name is Ray Reed.

After talking with several people at various locations and with various businesses I met Glen Osgood at Bakersfield Camping World.

I shared my needs with Glen as he listened attentively.

I shared that I was in the need of buying some very nice 5th wheels for my RV Park located in the Mojave desert about 50 Miles North of Baker California. The place is called Tecopa Ca. People come there for the healing effects of the very high hot mineral waters.

I shared that I wanted to buy either a heartland bighorn or keystone Montana because of their insulation characteristics.  I shared that I would pay on the spot but only wanted to pay average retail.

Glen immediately understood my needs, and goals.

That very day Glen showed me a bighorn and I bought it. On the way to dinner Glen called and said his manager Tracy was having a Denali being delivered and it would fit our needs perfectly.

We came back and loved it, some things needed repaired as it was a 2015.  Glen sold it to us for average retail and he and Tracy fixed everything.

Today,  we bought a 2005 and a 2009 Montana keystone at average retail, each needing a few things done but are going to be done.

Glen is a very nice man, and he went to management with what my needs were and Glen made this happen for us.  So, no Craig’s list for us.

I hope to be buying more in the future as our park expands.

He have we having a wonderful experience. Gary our salesman really hustle to find what we wanted for our lifestyle as well as the price range. I don't think anyone could beat the price as well as a service that we received at Camping World. Shout out to Gary for all your hard work and the staff that stayed late to make this happen.</review>

I would have given no stars for the service I received but that’s not available. Traveled with a camping world purchased 5th wheel from North Carolina. Air conditioning stopped working and had problem with hot water heater. Camping world refused to even look at it as they were too busy with their $59.00 install. I understand busy but what about service after the sale. To be fair other camping worlds refused to help also and are receiving  the same message. This was our third RV purchased from camping world and our last.< /text>

I came here because I'd seen mentions of it on YouTube by RV life and van life vloggers.  At one point there was free overnight parking here. That lot is no longer there. Ioutdide there are dozens of RVs to look at and a few open for touring. I went inside and found loads of camping & RV tools and accessories, solar panels, generators, camp chairs, grills RV life themed clothing chairs just to name a few. I was in here an hour and signed up for the Good Sam club before I left. 😂<//review>

<text>Retail accessories store is setup really nice. Didn't use service or parts department. But the service department is huge! The camper sales is the largest I've ever seen at a Camping World. Back to the accessories sales, layout of store is a little different then the other stores I've been in, it didn't flow as nicely but it is decent size... not too large and not too small... It has everything and then some. Employee's weren't extremely nice or helpful but weren't grumpy either (i.e. didn't ask us if we needed help, which generally I feel is obnoxious but they didn't even do it once. More over I had to wait at the cash register for near 5 minutes before a cashier came to the front of the store). Maybe they were just short staffed that day. I'm being overly picky about the employees and store. Overall 4.5 stars.<//text><Response>{'time': 1523027872084, 'text': 'Thank you for your review.

Hubby & I had such a great experience shopping for our next “vacation home”. Thanks to Naight in Sales. What a super star they have in him. Not only was he so knowledgeable about each RV but he had a “way “ that I appreciate in sales. He was amazing in helping us choose the right fit or us. I would highly recommend him to my friends and family and you won’t be disappointed either. Kudos to Camping World for having a great salesman & person  as we found in Naight and thanks Naight for your help & guidance.
10 gold stars!< /text>

<text>I ordered slide toppers and window awnings 2 weeks ago and was told they would be here in 5 days.They couldn't manage to order them while I was there so I went home and waited two days before calling again and finally getting them ordered.I this morning to find our where they are and was told they were not sure they were even ordered but was told they would call me a let me know what was going on.Guess what,no call.Called this evening talked to someone else who assured me they were ordered but had no idea where they were and that they might be there but there shipping receiving guy was our for a few days.I can only assume he is the only one that can read a shipping label.Worst experience I have ever had from start to finish.Very disappointed</text></record></dataset><record>

Do not take your rv here for service. My living room slide would not go out I took it to camping world because I purchased the trailer there and I was told the slide motor was bad and needed to be replaced. I denied the repairs picked the trailer up. come to find out the bell housing needed to be adjusted. My husband made that adjustment and the slide works just fine. Nice try camping world! This is the second time I took the trailer to camping world for the same problem. The first time my trailer was still under warranty they made the adjustment and the slide worked fine one time after they "fixed" it the first time. The second time they told me to bring it in and if it was the same problem as the first it would be fixed at no cost to me because my warranty had expired by then. Of course they called me a week later and said motor needed to be replaced it would be $780. I asked why they didn't replace it the first time when it was in there under warranty and I was told because adjusting it fixed the problem the first time..apparently it didn't! I will be filing a fraud complaint against them.< /Review>

Several dishonest and pushy salesman there.  Do not trust anything they tell you.  Do not buy anything they tell you.  Do not sign anything they ask you to sign.  Do your own research and google.  If you must buy an RV go to a different store outside of Bakersfield.  I was lied to several times by multiple people there and you know who you are.  Behind the smiles and fake relationships they try to push on you...are often crap products.  They will actually try to get you to buy those products over better RVs they have on the lot and on their website.  They will schedule you to sign documents with the bank, even fully knowing that you didn't agree to sign them or buy a particular RV.  This they will do because they want to make a sale before the end of the month.  They will try to guilt you into buying what they want you to buy and they will refuse to listen to the customer when they say no.  I could go on and on about them, but you get the picture.  Totally dishonest, bad customer service.</Text>

<Text>While on a trip from Seattle to Tucson, I had a hydraulic stabilizer jack failure  on my motorhome while traveling through Bakersfield. David and Carlos in parts/service at camping world worked me into their schedule, and got a replacement jack within days for a warranty repair. As soon as the jack arrived they got me in the next day, got the new jack installed, and I'm back on the road. These two guys went out of their way to get me back on the road quickly. They are a true asset to Camping World of Bakersfield.< /Text>< pictures>

Went in to the Camping World in Bakersfield and was just wanting to look at the options of various rigs. Not ready to buy just yet, but the salesman, Steve Kane, was very helpful and didn’t make me feel like I was wasting his time. Thank you again Steve and we will be seeing you soon.<//text>

Went in yesterday to try and find this 3 piece set of sleeping bag, tent and bag but when I asked the girl she didn't help much except no we don't have anymore. I was curious on the brand or make so I can look somewhere else for the item so after I left I called to ask and the lady who answered not sure of her name but she's always their in the evening running the store part and is really really bad at customer service. I've gone in quite a bit in the last months or so because we recently bought an RV and let me tell you she is very unpleasant and unknowledgeable  about anything in the store. She seems to always say "hmm I don't know" or "ohh emm not sure your going to have to ask someone else". its like WOW lady why do you even work there then.I really just want to know the brand of the item so I can find it else where but apparently that is too difficult of a task for them to look up. I think I'll start buying my self online or walmart just so I don't experience her ridiculous service again.</text>

<text>We purchased a north point over 2 weeks ago had scheduled to pick it up the following weekend unfortunately a work situation kept us from picking up the rv
the staff was very helpful and worked with us to reschedule. We were able to get the coach on black friday. The service department was closed so we were not expecting a walk through the new rv. They called in a young man on his day off to do the walk and i have nothing but great things to say about him! I do feel bad for them bringing in someone on their day off. We also had great interactions with the parts department to get our washer/ dryer and the capture plate.
We highly recommend this camping world!!</text>< pictures>

Poor service. Terrible customer care, filed complaint, with corporate, called by manager Tracy, kind of blown off. Told to stop by when in the area and enjoy some popcorn and a cup of free coffee. Wow, that's a treat after spending over $85,000 on a MH.</Review>

Our sales person was very helpful, Rick Gatson) .We arrive early to pick up our trailer and they let us it get before the time. Very friendly stuff and helpful.  We would tell our friends about them.< /Review>

The absolute worst customer service and organization skills I've ever experienced!! I'm amazed they are still in business!! What happened to standards and principal?? I don't even want to try and go into details... I've never rated anything in my life until this...... Hopefully save somebody else the headache... Don't expect them to back up any one of their products, no matter how well they talk it up on the sell... They will do everything possible to avoid warranty work... The sad thing is, they must have hourly workers brainwashed too... Why the hell should they care? Not coming out of their pocket!!<//review>

We first went to Camping World of Bakersfield a few months ago and looked at 5th wheel trailers. We found one but was having a hard time finding the truck we loved.
We felt if we were going to spend that kind of money we were not going to settle for less than what we wanted. We then went back about a month later and looked at toy haulers. We met Bob Barry on that trip and talked to him. We left and about a month later he gave us a call on a Sunday and told us a truck and been turned in and he thought it might be just what we were looking for. We went in and asked to see the truck. He said it was backed up to the 5th wheel we had looked at. He took us out to see it and when we saw the truck backed up to the trailer we were sold! It was just what we were looking for! A perfect match. Our experience with Camping World of Bakersfield has been excellent so far. We hope the service after the sale is as good.< /Review>

<Text>After deciding to upgrade our trailer, we started at Camping World where we bought our last trailer. Our salesman, Virgil, was awesome. After getting info on what we wanted, we looked at two and the second was perfect! Thank you Camping World, Stephanie, and of course Virgil!< /Text></record>

<Review>We left Dallas Texas on August 22nd and were traveling through Bakersfield in our 2013 Airstream Interstate and the generator stopped working. Gil Rodriguez, a service advisor worked us into their schedule and serviced my generator and got us back on the road the same day. My wife, myself, my father-in-law, and my 4 dogs were very happy to have air conditioning again.
Thank you Gil and Camping World for your help!!!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>We are first time RV owners so it was a pleasant surprise when we went to Camping World. No pesky sales people! There were sales people, but it was more like they were there to answer any questions and guide us through choosing the right RV for US.

Glenn was very open and honest. He explained everything about owning an RV and told us what our truck could pull and what it couldn't. It took us about a couple of weeks to decide which one we wanted, even changing our minds at the last moment for different one.

The "inside" staff (front desk, financial, store, parts, service, etc...) were just as fantastic. Everyone was so sweet and ready to help. If someone couldn't answer a question, they went and found someone who could.

The financial wizard, Leesa, was a darling and talked to us about all things financial and helped us go through the details of financing the RV. She was very patient and very friendly. When our indecision got the best of us, she didn't get frustrated. She laughed and came with us and saw two of the RV's that we were hemming and hawing over. She gave us some sound advice about payment over the one we decided we really wanted (but could we afford it?... Turns out we could!) So she helped our final decision.

All in all, my wife and I would highly recommend Camping World. Our experience has been nothing but great. We're extremely satisfied. As first time RV owners (5th wheel) we would definitely go back there for another one, but thanks to Camping World, I believe we found our forever RV!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I purchased a dish reciever from them and when I went to use it It had  a authorization error and was not able to work according to dish network. Since I was already on my camping trip when I went to use it I couldn’t take it back to camping world it was purchased at. The response I received from the store was that I could return if I was an active good Sam member. First off there was not a camping world in the area I was camping and if I wasn’t an active good Sam member then I would be stuck with the defective equipment that they sold me indefinitely.....so basically I purchased the reciever I couldn’t use and couldn’t return since there wasn’t any store in the area. Dish network could exchange the equipment but would charge me $50 to do so! Not happy at all with the service from this store and very unhappy with product they sold me as well as the return policy. I will purchase the reciever from dish network directly and save the hassle of possibly buying equipment that is defective in the future! Will do business elsewhere from now on. Extremely disappointed with the return policy for this business!< /review>

<Text>1) Sales department tried to get me to pay $2000 for the delivery inspection when there was a huge banner out front of the business that said, “Free camp-ready package inspection”.
2) Finance department added the surface protection package without my consent and then tried to get me to pay $1700 for it.
3) Finance department told me they would email me the pricing of the extended warranties and other add-ons to me, but never sent them despite several unreturned voicemails I left for her.
4) Same finance person then called me a week after the close of the sale, yelling and threatening me because I brought to light her work performance short comings to the dealership management.

Avoid this place like the plaque!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>yes I did write a review already it was not a very good review I don't know what happened that day I guess the person that I was dealing with must have been having a bad day I had spoke with somebody else a few days later after contacting corporate office the gentleman I spoke with has taken care of everything and made it right the bad thing is if we could have done this from the get-go that way I wouldn't have had to put a bad mark now I wished I could take the bad mark back and I thank you so much for making things right I guess it's who you speak with now I know from now on when I go into Camp World which Camp world is the only place that I buy my accessories from and I bought my fifth wheel RV from I will make sure when I cannot get something done with a person I am speaking with I will just start going above their head and speak with somebody that has more Authority thank you so much Camping World of Bakersfield for making this thing right</Review>< gmap_id>

< review>
Worst experience I've ever had at any retail establishment. Cashiers in the store were rude and had the attitude that I was an inconvenience. I tried to get an appointment for service on my 5th wheel, by scheduling online and over the phone, only to find out that I could only make a request for an appointment and I needed to wait for them to contact me to schedule. Well it's  been at least a month now, without ever being contacted. Needless to say I've found another RV Center to do my service. I will never set foot in a Camping World again not even if I'm out of Toilet paper, it's just not worth it.< /review>

<Text>We have been taking our travel trailer to Camping world for service for the past quite awhile.  We have had quite a few items added to it and have had some items fixed/repaired.  We recently took it in to have a repair work done.  When we came to pick up our travel trailer, after submitting payment and receiving our keys/paperwork, the staff went to collect the trailer and found that it was missing.  My husband and their staff looked every where and came to the conclusion that it had been taken without anyone noticing.  It had been stolen while under their lock and key.  Instead of Camping World accepting some responsibility for this, they have basically stated that it was our problem and we needed to deal with it.  So, we have had to file a police report (which they should have) and turn it into our insurance.  We are so disappointed that after all these years and all that we have had them work on to be treated this way.  We are sad to say that we would not recommend anyone to take their RV or Trailer here for repair in case this happens to them.< /Text><pics>None</pics><user_id>104127073069975986339</user_id>< gmap_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Went to buy an RV at Camping World. Salesman was Bob Barry. We were looking at an RV that Fresno had for about $69,000. While we were looking at this RV, Bob came out and said that he had talked to the Sales Manager and they would sell us the RV for $68000 and a $250 gift card. We agreed and went in to sign the paperwork. While we were filling out the contract, Bob stepped out of the office and then just as we finished filling out everything, he says the Sales Manager had changed his mind and the price was now almost $2000 higher PLUS about $500 dealer prep, about $75 Doc fee and tax and Lic (I expected the last two----Fresno had included dealer prep and doc fee in their price already). I was shocked as he had already told us he had talked to the sales manager and had been authorized to sell this for a lot less than what he was now trying to sell it for. I grabbed back the contract and told him "NO WAY". He said he would go get the Sales Manager so we could "all have a discussion". It was at that point we got up and walked out. What a double dealing, bait and switch load of crap. I complained in an email to Marcus Lemonis, CEO of Camping World. He responded with an email saying the employee would be disciplined and asked how he could regain our trust. I responded to his email and never heard back from him.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My wife and I purchased a 17' Jayco Baja Edition from here about 1 month ago.  We LOVE this trailer!
Mike Osgood greeted us promptly, and went straight to the trailers we were interested.  We looked at about 5, until we found the one we purchased.
Unlike a couple of other RV Centers, Mike was the first salesman, who Really knew the products.  There was absolute No pressure, and he let us take our time while looking at each trailer.  Other places made us feel rushed, but not here.
This is my first trailer purchase, so I had allot of questions, and Mike was terrific!  He explained everything I wanted to know about each unit, advantages, and disadvantages; he really knew his stuff!
Once in the sales office, we worked the numbers exactly to our liking.  It was one of the smoothest, and most pleasant buying experiences I've had.  My wife liked one of the chairs in the showroom, so Mike threw it into the deal.  Friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and listened to our needs.
After our great experience with Mike, we were off to finance, with Leesa.  She also was great!  She also is Very friendly, knowledgeable, and no pressure.  We were very excited about our purchase; Mike, and Leesa made it that much more fun, with no bs, providing a low key sales experience.
While we were in Finance, they were cleaning up our trailer, and installing the trailer brake unit on our SUV.  Ken than showed us to our trailer, which was now immaculate.  He started at the rear bumper, and explained everything we needed to know about our new trailer.  He answered every question, sometimes twice, as again, this was our first trailer purchase.  Very friendly, and knew our unit inside and out.
We took the trailer out that day, and used it for 3 days, near Morro Bay, Ca., without a hitch.
There was one problem.  The generator we purchased didn't start.  I called Camping World, and Spoke with Pam.  I was expecting a hassle, since everything else went so well.  She told me she was sorry for the inconvenience, and had me come in, and exchange the generator for another, which I did.  I'm sorry if anyone has experienced any problem here with sales, because our experience was so positive!
A wonderful buying experience, so different from many other places we visited.  We recommend them, without reservation.  See Mike, he's fantastic!< /Review>

We bought a new refrigerator for our 32 year old class c motorhome at this location and had them install it. They also installed a new exterior refrigerator access cover. All of this work was done this Memorial Day, while we waited.

The staff was very courteous and helpful. The work was performed to the highest standards. The floor of the refrigerator compartment was painted and sealed to prevent damage from condensation. The wiring was carefully routed and connections were properly soldered and wrapped. They used an upgraded condensation drip tube that will last the life of the refrigerator, and routed it correctly. The finish work that is visible inside the interior of motorhome was performed with obvious care and experience.

We purchased a Dometic RM2620R. This particular Camping World location is Dometic factory certified (not all are). It really shows in their work.

Happy and impressed!<//Review>

Helpful, knowledgeable staff walked me through the entire process. I got a really good price on my toy hauler!  If you need an RV or you want to sell your current rig, I highly recommend Camping World. They have everything you may need and are great to work with. Thanks guys, for everything !< /review>
