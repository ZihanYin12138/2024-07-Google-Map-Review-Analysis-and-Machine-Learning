Great Taiwanese Fast Food. They have all the good stuff. Fried fish cake was inconsistent for us, some days good and chewy, some days seemingly over fried or hard and crunchy. All in all, great to have in this area as not many Taiwanese options near here< /text>

Huge portion for low price! Food was delicious too. Only downside is the small occupancy but a low key place like this you shouldn't have trouble waiting in line to get a seat.< /Review>

Authentic  and tasty Taiwanese food but a bit pricy.   It will be better if they can have more variety food and vegetarian food.</Review>

< Review>
Me and my family brought 5 of our other family members who just came visit us from Taiwan, all of us were very satisfied with the quality of the foods there. My wife said that the rice box is even better than the one we had the most in Taipei. My youngest sister said the cold noodle she ordered was surprisingly tasty. All of us ordered different kind of dishes and we all loved it. We will definitely come again when we are nearby.

The restaurant declared they put no MSG and any artificial additives into their foods, they also cook their food with purified water. Those are the ones I concern the most, and I never had such a good experience with a Taiwanese restaurant around Rowland Heights and Irvine area, where I just moved to about half a year ago. It is not too salty, not too oily, but tastes GOOD! Also the dining environment is comfortable, I would say among most of the other Chinese restaurants around RH and Irvine I had before.

Try it once and you will know how good and healthy Taiwanese foods can be.<//Review>

<review>Hainan chicken rice is a knockout. On their menu I think they call it "ginger chicken rice". Whatever you call it, chicken  is juicy, tender, richly flavoured, with lots of grated garlic and veggies on the side. Tea  is right on, too, with just the level of sweetness you specify. While I'm ranting, might  as  well mention how good the red beans are in the shaved ice!< /review>< pictures>

Good food. I like railroad pork chop, noodles with fried fish or chicken basil.

Bad part? This place is small and parking sucks because it's small and this plaza has a lot of popular restaurants and shops.</text>< Pictures>

<review>What a disappointment!  Should have turned and left when I saw how out of place this restaurant was in a plaza occupied by Trader Joe's.  But, then again, out of place restaurants usually have the best food (at least from my experience).  Why Thirsty, however, isn't one of these places.

To start, if you can't read Chinese, don't EVEN bother showing up to this place.  It's the first Asian restaurant I've been to that have menus that's ALL in Chinese!  Thank God I went to Chinese School!

I ordered the Beef Noodle and it was MEH.  The beef wasn't that tender and the noodle/broth was fairly typical.  I tried the pork chop and it wasn't anything special either.  I've definitely experienced better.

Overall, I was disappointed.  I thought it would be pretty good since it was rated 4 stars on Yelp and there seems to be a never ending line of people wanting to get a table.  Maybe I'm missing something they're aware of?< /review><time>1395871567084<//time></record>

<review>Came here twice . First was to try the popcorn chicken rice . The portion was good. The chicken come in a separate bag so it doesnt get soggy and made me feel like I'm getting alot of it .
The second time I tried the railroad dish, which pretty much is like pork cutlet but is pan fried instead of deep fried which makes it not crispy. It's... Not as great as I thought it would be , I actually would like eating deep fried cutlet (katsu) version of this. Taste is decent.
The premium  milk tea is pretty good.<//review><Rate>3</Rate><Name>Alex P<//Name><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

My husband referred me here because he had such a great experience. He was right, they are outstanding! Dr Tan, Mayra and the other assistant who did the scans (I’m sorry, I forgot your name!) were friendly, professional and made me feel welcome. Everything was thoroughly explained and all my questions were answered, the office is immaculate and they take the COVID restrictions seriously.  Great selection of frames and I had fun picking the right ones. Thank you for such a great experience!<//Review>

I am so happy to have discovered Beach Eye. I am partially sighted with high correction requirements.  The staff is great very friendly and knowledgeable.  I will definitely recommend them to friends and family.  Also, they disinfect the glasses after you trial them. Superb attention to detail</text>

I have always enjoyed my experience at this office. For the past few years there has been no question in my mind about where to have my eye care needs met. The entire team is friendly and the environment is clean and comfortable. Don’t hesitate! If you have never tried Beach Eyecare... try it now 🤓<//review>

It is always such a nice experience to come in for my vision screening and to choose new frames. The optometrist and staff are always very friendly, and I always leave feeling great about the whole experience and their expertise in helping me choose new glasses. I am always advised about the best value I can get with my vision plan.</text>

My daughter has been to other eye doctors so she was pretty familiar with the process but the doctor took time to explain what the exam would entail and walked her through every step.

Since we’ve first visited, my daughter has had a couple mishaps that affected her glasses, even during COVID (very safe protocols in place) the staff was super helpful and went out of their way to make us feel appreciated. They fixed her frames both times, no charge.

I can’t recommend this place enough. We’ve had a great experience here.< /review>< pics>

We recently moved back to Long Beach and I did my research for the perfect optometrist and facility.
The whole staff from the beginning of my appointment to the exam with the Doctor and to the end of my appointment they were all great! I myself work in healthcare and I know how important it is to make patients feel good about going to a new doctor or facility. I appreciated everyone in the office and I am so happy I found a great place to come too.</text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Tan for a few years now and I am very much appreciative of her and her staff. All the women in the front office are attentive, helpful, and kind. The office is always clean and welcoming. All their equipment is up to date, even their sign in process is technologically advanced and user friendly. You can tell a lot of thought and care goes into this space. Oh and they also carry a large selection of frames.

Now for the main reason I chose to write this review, Dr. Tan. I have keratoconis and left my last optometrist because I wasn’t able to get the care I needed. I would get contacts and they would help me see, but not anywhere as good as friends of mine who didn’t wear any corrective lenses. When I came to Dr. Tan, she introduced me to the hybrid lenses. These lenses were not easy to adjust to, because they are a hard lens with a soft skirt and I had worn soft lenses for over 15 years. However, my vision improved tremendously. I literally felt like I had a new pair of eyes. I’ve seen ophthalmologist that I felt weren’t as attentive & informative as Dr. Tan is as my Optometrist . I have come to her with a few different issues that are common to those of us with keratoconis, and she’s always proven to be so well educated. I appreciate that and highly recommend Beach Care Optometry to anyone.</Text>

Such a great experience here at Beach Eyecare Optometry! My sister recommended them to me since it’s been 3 years since I had last gotten my eyes checked. I called in to make an appointment and due to covid, it’s by appointment only which is nice so it doesn’t get too crowded in there. It took about a month until I went in but the entire process from start to finish was smooth. The staff were super friendly and helpful and Dr. Chen made me feel super comfortable. She’s really friendly and I felt like she truly cared. It was my first time here and I would recommend anyone looking to get their eyes checked to come here. They accept medical which is another plus. My medical insurance was able to cover my eye exam and a free pair of glasses! The lady helping me was nice to let me know and even helped me pick out a pair! I ended up also paying a bit extra to get a contact lenses fitting since I wanted to get daily’s so I’m not always wearing my glasses. Dr. Chen gave me about 5 days worth to try out. In addition, I love how they gave text message reminders about my appointment since I tend to be forgetful! They also took great Covid precautions so that was also a plus. If you need an exam or contact fitting, I suggest you go here! Definitely worth it!</review>

What a pleasant group of people at Beach Eye are Optometry.  Dr. Tan was very nice to speak with during my eye examination & thorough with my exam.  Raven was helpful in selecting my frames and various lence choices.  It always nice to experience a great interaction when you're only expecting a good one!  Exceeding expectations is always a memorable experience that creates patronage going forward!</review>

Second visit here. Once pre-COVID days and once in 2021.
The optometrist is great with making my son feel comfortable. The staff is very helpful and welcoming.
Everything was wiped down and I feel was efficient at keeping COVID safe protocols.

Highly recommend.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>As always, Dr. Tan, Myra and Raven gave me a great opto service. I received a very thorough annual eye exam for glasses and contacts in Aug 2020.  I'm very impressed with the safety measures they have in place both for the staff and patients to prevent spread and protect from Covid-19. Dr. Tan is a true professional and always displays  a caring quality towards me, her patient. I recommend her highly. Stay safe all!!

Went in Aug 2021 for my annual exam.  Always a pleasure to see Dr. Tan and her staff. So grateful to Dr. Tan for educating/informing me about lens replacement surgery. What a difference it makes on my life! Thank you Dr. Tan!</Review>< pics>

Everyone is very kind and helpful whether I’m having my eyes examined or looking for new frames. Plus they give good recommendations when looking for a new pair. They even let me harass my mom with pop culture references as she looks for frames. I look forward to her receiving her Tim Gunn glasses.< /Text>

I was a New patient at this office on 2/19/20. Super professional and welcoming as soon as you enter their office. First the staff is very welcoming. From greeting to offering something to drink right away. They are very outgoing and made everything very comfortable and at ease. I had the pleasure to be treated by Dr. Tran. She is very sweet and professional in her industry. Explained the whole process, answered all questions and gave great suggestions for my eye health where I didn't fell pressured or obligated vs some other offices that just want to get every cent out of my pocket. I left very satisfied and happy. Thank you all! And a big thank you to Claudia or Mayra (i'm sorry) I don't recall your name but she went over the my plan benefits very detailed an as a medical biller I appreciate that, and helped me picked my glasses you are awesome at what you do!!<//Review>

I got there early and already a sign of great customer service! Not a problem! The staff was friendly, the doctor was so nice and made feel so comfortable. I just moved to Long Beach and needed a new doctor for an emergency visit ( I was going on vacation and needed contacts ) they saw me right away and gave me enough samples for my trip!! I’ll keep coming back</Review>

My wife has been taking herself here and my two boys 8 and 5 year old, The staff and doctor are super nice and know exactly how to talk to young children. My 5 year old was scared to go get checked but there way of dealing with small children makes them feel safe and comfortable now he says he loves going to get his eyes checked! Truly recommend them. Thank you Beach Eyecare you guys are great.< /Text>

Great service! I've been coming here for years. The optometrists are really easy to talk to, nd they are open on Saturdays!  The only down side is that their selection of frames in store is limited compared to others. However, I was able to special order the Ray Ban frames that I wanted since it is a brand they carry.< /review>

<Review>I love these ladies.  The doctor (Dr. Tan) is so friendly and we always have great conversations about family and our little ones.  She explains everything very well, listens to my concerns, asks questions and doesn’t talk down to me.  This lady really knows her stuff.  When Dr. Tan was out on maternity leave we got to see Dr. Lavinder.  She was also very nice and knowledgeable.  All of the office staff is very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Big bonus, they send text message reminders to make appointments and to let you know when glasses are ready to pick up.  They respond to requests quickly and have gone out of their way to help me multiple times.  My kids are also very comfortable with everyone in the office, and they are very patient and engaging with my very inquisitive 7 yo, which is great because it’s the one doctor’s appointment we don’t have drama about!!  Thanks for that ladies!!

Update* As always I love this office!  We forgot our appointment and they called to remind us and helped us out in getting a new pair of glasses for my 9 yo.  She had a recent eye injury and was a little nervous about the pressure test, but Dr Tab was super patient with her and got us through it.  Can’t wait to get our new glasses with blue light protection!!!<//Review>< pics>

They have a great selection of frames and sunglasses, and you can't beat the price. I have recommended Beach Eyecare Optometry to a lot of my friends and family and they loved them!

< Review>
My daughter had her first eye exam and she was scared and nervous, as I was too, but we felt so comfortable as soon as we walked in.  Dr.Tan was awesome!
loved the way we were treated will definitely tell all my family and friends about this place..
thank you Dr.Tan</Review>

I’m very upset because they encountered me to change my contact brand but they did not tell me it was triple the amount I was paying for my original contracts now I can’t switch it back without going through a whole situation
So thank you very much 👍🏻< /Text>

<text>Our cat and dog have been going here for 1 year. When our dog became ill, they were quick to diagnose him with a chronic condition and hospitalize until it stabilized. He has been doing great with medication since then. The additionally prescribed food/vitamins is a little pricy but we clearly see a difference in his health when using both of them and do not feel that they are fishing for money. My cat's prescription weight loss food is also expensive, but has provided great nutrients for his older age and he successfully lost what he needed over a year period. My cat recently became ill and they were compassionate in my worries and accommodating that I preferred to treat from home. Though he eventually needed to be hospitalized, he returned diagnosed and treated. The front staff has always been friendly and helpful with our needs, even when managing the busiest hours. Because they only have walk in visits and not appointments, there is often a wait especially at peak times. However, I do not mind given that I can come at my convenience, the visits are not rushed to 'keep on a schedule', and they are happy to demonstrate things like how to brush teeth or inject a needle. The 24 hour emergency line has also come in handy. They have gone above and beyond more than once, even opening early during one emergency. We enjoy supporting small businesses and this father/son clinic is no exception.< /text></record>

<Text>Vets are good. The front desk, however, is another matter. There is not only a complete lack of urgency, it’s almost as if they’re all sleep walking. Any time I come in, the vet does their job within a 1/2 hour. Then I spend 1 1/2 hours waiting to pay. I don’t understand why this is allowed.

Update - I am moving my dogs with me to the EU, and this veterinarian is listed as USDA certified under the USDA website. There are specific shots and requirements for moving dogs abroad, and you need to go to a USDA certified veterinarian to ensure compliance with those requirements.

I called the office, explained the situation to the front desk, and they could do it, but insisted that I needed to find out what all of the requirements are and then bring the printed information to them. I couldn't understand why someone who is accredited would need ME to be the expert in this, when they are the accredited USDA veterinarians and I'm not. But they have been my regular veterinarian for the last two years, and I preferred going there since they have the full records on file, and another vet would not.

So, I brought in the printed documents that I thought they needed today, and was met with the head of the front desk coming out with an accusatory tone, and asking me what I want her to do(as if I'm asking for the moon). Turns out, they refuse to do this work, and a month of my time has been wasted. All they need to do is provide a microchip, a rabies vaccine, an anti-echinococcus treatment, and finally, complete a health certificate. They told me they can do the health certificate, and we all know that vets implant microchips and give vaccinations/treatments, so why are they being so obtuse about this? And to keep me on the hook for a month, thinking that they will help me, when they refuse, is inexcusable.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. The front desk of this vet is...well, awful. They're awful.

Not to mention every product they sell is 200% of the price on Chewy. Greedy.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Date>1618675653078</Date><response>{'time': 1616614055186, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words about our veterinarians, we love great feedback like that.

<Text>We came and I was surprised by how quickly they saw our Bricka.  Xrays were quickly done and we were given our options professionally and compassionately (she slipped a disk).   I never felt they were over priced.
Very glad we found this hospital.   Taking our cat in for her shots now.  They deserve our repeat business.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcd3f5dd1677ed:0x60d7e64fc5582bd3< /gmapID>< date>

<Text>Disappointed with demeanor of the front desk, we have taken our dogs here for years, the service and the way its run has changed drastically since we started. My older dog just had surgery about 2 months ago, $1700 , then we take our young dog to the shot clinic on Saturday, I was told the dog needs a health checkup before it can get updated shots (been over a year since last visit)...I asked the tech why we need to pay for an office visit, as we had come on the discount day, and paying for a health checkup would completely negate the savings that we had come for ( an additional $50+), I was told rather rudely that it is a CA law the dog must have a checkup before the shots, while I would normally understand business is business, we are in extenuating circumstances, this "pandemic" has laid people off work, with little money to spare for surprise fees legislated by the state of CA, having spent $1,700 with them the month prior I was looking for a little leeway on having to pay $50 for the vet tech to pet my dog before giving it a shot. The lady did not budge, and again, did not even go about it in an understanding way. So I looked up the "law" she was referring to, to my surprise the very first line in it said it is up to the facility on whether they charged a fee for this "service" or not. That did it for me, if this place cant even cut a customer a break during these crazy times (when specifically allowed by the law she stated), they obviously don't need my business in the future. Family and friends that I have recommended this vet to in the past will get an update from me from my recent experience. I understand business is business, but when they blamed it on a law and made it sound like their hands were tied, when the law specifically states that they do not have to charge a fee for the "service",  shows me how much they really care about their customers.< /Text>< pics>

We recently moved to Yorba Linda and tried out IHAC. We have been nothing but impressed across the board. Their pricing is extremely fair, but more importantly, the service is top-notch. You would expect a lower quality of service at these prices, but they continue to impress.

Our poor pup is having age health related issues and they have provided prompt service AND emergency response at night that was above and beyond what we expected. Cannot recommend enough.< /text>

<text>Imperial Highway Animal Clinic has been providing care for our Rescue dogs for quite sometime.  We feel that the care given at this Hospital is truly one of the best.  All the doctors are there and take their time with each and every patient we send them, and they provide excellent care for them.  They communicate well with my staff in regards to treatments given and follow up instructions.  The staff is friendly and the office is clean.  We have confidence and trust in these Doctors knowing our dogs are in great hands.  - GSROC Team<//text>< Pics>

<review>Our family and friends have  been coming to Imperial Highway Animal
clinic for 35 years . Dr. Mike Adam and Dr. John Adam are top notch when it comes to patient care, compassion, doing what is necessary and best to keep our pets healthy. Their goals are to keep our pets safe and live long lives. I have always been treated like family 🥰 and cannot express how fortunate and blessed we are to have found such honest, caring, and knowledgeable veterinary professionals. The staff is excellent and will go above and beyond to make sure you are happy and understand the services needed. I LOVE their new app and makes ordering our pets meds and making appointments so easy. The selfies and points are a bonus !< /review>< time>

<review>I have 6 pets that moved with me from Texas. I was really worried about finding the “right” vet for my babies. My brother-in-law recommended Imperial Pet Hospial because he’s always brought his pets there. Well lo and behold my 10 year old pup started coughing in January. She was seen by Dr. Mike And was diagnosed with bronchitis and an enlarged heart. She has been seeing Dr. Mike And Dr. John since. I feel my pets are in good hands with the staff. I’m glad this vet clinic was recommended.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1582028547214, 'text': 'We are so glad you belong with us now.

Best Animal Clinic I have ever been to... Dr. Adams saved my dog’s life & my friend’s dog’s life who both came down with Parvo at different times... never heard of a dog surviving Parvo ever, but with Dr. Adam’s expert care, they did!  Brought my female Schipperke in who acted like she was dying (doing the hiding thing) & he had a hunch that she had diabetes which she did... Gave me medication to give to her & she got better... Always went above & beyond the call of duty!  Would highly recommend this vet to everyone & anyone!</text>

Imperial Animal Clinic and Dr John Adam are the best! i have a 8 month old maltipoo and have taking her there since she was 4 months. I changed vets to Dr Adam when i had an emergency with her. My other vet sent me home and said I may have to take her to a 24 hour animal hospital later that night if she continued to vomit. At the recommendation of my son, who uses Dr Adam, I called him. He told me what to do and said I could call him that night and he would meet me at his clinic. He checked on her and kept her all day for observation and took great care of her. I  decided right then to switch vets and have been very happy ever since! I love that I can bring my puppy in any time and they get us right in. My last visit with the senior Dr Adam was great too! My puppy swallowed something and they were able to retrieve it with an endoscope and she didn't need surgery. The office staff is friendly and helpful. My pup loves visiting and has never shown signs of anxiety coming to see the vet! They always put me at ease too. I would highly recommend Imperial Hwy Animal clinic!<//text>

<review>I had really great experiences with all the vet docs here. they are really great with my dog who has some anxiety issues.  The desk staff went through some changes it seems this past year and while those changes appeared to be negative things have been straightened out and they are once again operating a very efficient office.  I really like the new vet doc - he is very attentive to my dog and her need for a gentle touch - will be back for all my dogs vet needs.
i can highly recommend this veterinary office.</review><username>kathy wammack< /username>< Resp>

Dr John and the staff were great, caring and generous, but my sweet boy lost his battle late October 2018.

Imperial Highway Animal Clinic has provided excellent preventive and necessary care for our family pets for years.  They truly come to develop a understanding and specific knowledge of your pets history and needs.  Our German Shepherds have been under their watchful care since they were puppies.  The additional services of bathing and grooming are nice to in many ways make them a "one stop shop". I would strongly recommend them for their service to both pet and owners.<//review>

I have been going to Dr. Adams for many years with rescue dogs for the Lab Rescue I am volunteering for. They are always there for us and help in any way they can. I love that I don’t have to have an appt. so I can get in and they are there for us any time we need them. They are generous and offer us discounts on the procedures as money are important to us so we can save more dogs. Always friendly and nice, great place to go.</review>

Great experience as always. This place don't turn you away with your sick pet because you don't have an appointment or because they are closing at 3.00 pm. you can see 3.00 pm and still many dogs and cats signed up and waiting for their turn in the vaccine clinic. They are dedicated to help your pet. Walk in welcome, you want to see the same dr you like, no problem. Started taking my cats there at 3 month old, 8 years later won't even consider any other place.</Review>

The Imperial Highway Animal Clinic is the best place for pets!  The staff and doctors are caring and knowledgeable. My Ginger, Scooby, Sparkle, and Bear have all been very blessed by the care they receive from the Veterinarians, the bathers, and the staff there. I am so grateful to have a place I can trust to take my pets.  Thank you guys!< /review>

<Text>We've been bringing our dog Frito to Imperial Highway Animal Clinic for 9 years and our 3 cats as well. Dr. Adams is top notch and the staff is also very kind and always ready to help you get your pet in to get what it needs.

A while back one of our cats had to be put to sleep. This wasn't easy, but they were very sympathetic and even sent us a card later.

They just go that one extra step it seems.<//Text>< Name>

We have been taking my dog to Imperial Highway Animal Clinic for the past three years. We have had nothing, but great experiences there. They have since added new employees. These new workers are fantastic. They are patient and kind not only with the animals, but also with the people. I never feel hurried, and I leave feeling confident as to what the treatment plan is for my animal.  I recommend this clinic to everyone.<//Review>

Dr. Mike and his staff are fantastic! I couldn't say enough nice stuff about these people. On a few occasions, Dr. Mike has waived a fee or given us a break on cost, very kind and considerate!
I have had 7 dogs, 3 of them have passed from old age and he has taken care of all of them.
He is a wonderful man, and the animals respond to him and his staff in a positive manner.</review>

Have been a client for over 20 years and wouldn't trust my dogs' care to any other Animal Clinic!   Dr. Adam and his son who is also a vet here, have always provided excellent care for all of our dogs!   The office staff and vet techs are all great, too!!  Highly recommend IHAC to anyone needing excellent care for their fur children!!!<//text>

<Text>I can't say enough about all the Dr.'s and staff at Imperial Animal Clinic!!  I have been going there for 24yrs.  My first rescue dog, Jessie, was 1 1/2 when I got him and started taking him to see Dr.Mike.  Through the 16yrs I had him, I couldn't ask for a more caring, compassionate Doctor.  Jessie had health issues as he got older. "Doc"always was there, yes, even in the middle of the night!!  When it was "time" to let go---Doc was as caring as can be.  I took my next rescue, "Ms Kinsey",  immediately to Doc for her welcome home check-up.  At that time Doc said she was closer to 7 or 8yrs old, not the 5 or 6yrs I was told.  Doc kept her healthy the best anybody could.  As she aged and also started having major health issues, Doc was always there, caring.  As time got closer, I asked him how long.  He said I would know.  The "last night" was on a Sunday.  I stayed up all night with her.  The next morning when I brought her in for her last trip, Doc asked why I didn't call him.  I told him I just wanted one last night before letting her go.  We let her go out of her suffering then.  I, because of Doc and his staff, was blessed to have her seven years.  Now, having married a "cat" man, Doc and staff have been taking care of "Koko" for the last 6 1/2 yrs.  She recently turned 17, and although age is creeping up, we know she is in the BEST of hands and care with all the caring Dr.'s and staff at Imperial Animal clinic.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Dr. Adams has been our vet for over 14 years and has taken great care of all of our pets.  He came in before hours when our cat Poe was recently the victim of a brutal early morning coyote attack in our backyard.  He kept our cat for almost a week and was very generous with our bill.  Our cat is doing well now!  Thank you!<//Review>

<Text>We have been bringing our many dogs to Dr. Mike for almost 3 decades - so he has been there for us for several emergencies, meeting us at the office at night or on the weekend. Last week our little 10#  maltipoo greeted us in the morning with her eyeball out of the socket - YIKES! I called the vet before 7 a.m. and Dr. Adam arrived just 5 minutes after we did. The cornea was dry so there was no vision and sweet Rosie had her eye removed that day... Because of OUR schedule and another dog at home, they kept her an extra day at no additional charge to us. I called a few times and they always checked on Rosie and gave us an update - very caring facility.<//Text><Name>Linda Gilman< /Name><GmapID>0x80dcd3f5dd1677ed:0x60d7e64fc5582bd3< /GmapID></record>

I have been bringing our pets to this facility for many years.  Everyone there from the receptionists to the doctors is caring, helpful, knowledgeable, and competent.  They are never pushy.  They give options and discuss the problems. They have always been able to take care of whatever the problem was.  I wouldn't consider going anywhere else.<//Review>

New puppy that we’ve taken to IHAC for the Saturday shot clinic multiple times over the past two months. Always crowded but never chaotic. Very organized. First puppy well check went great. Not only answered all of my health related questions but also provided basic necessary information on feeding, care, etc., being new to puppyhood. Veterinarians are great and prices are reasonable. I chose this vet primarily due to a past experience 10 years ago with a small breed dog horribly attacked by a coyote at about 11 PM. Dr. Adam was called, met us at the hospital and saved his life. It was a harrowing experience and long recovery but had it not been for him the dog would not have survived. Since that time many of my relatives have been customers of IHAC and all are extremely pleased!< /Review>

this clinic is wonderful!! they came highly recommended by neighbors so we thought we'd try them out.  you don't need an appointment.... just walk on in.... the office is clean and the staff extremely friendly.  our dog is older and she suffers from allergies.... things got super bad when spring hit us and she needed some help.  a quick check up, a shot, and a few meds and she is so much better!!  follow up appts are free.... the doctors here are awesome!!</review>

Not Good... We took our Bella to Imperial Highway Animal Clinic.  They bandaged her up, and gave her back to us.  Dog was not doing well, so we brought her back in, and said her kidneys were failing. They insisted on keeping her over the weekend, against our wishes. Dog died on Sunday, and they sent us an additional bill for the stay... They sent the account to collections because we refused to pay the extra $170 (had already spent $2K).<//text>

They did all they could to save her back leg, but finally had to amputate.  Now we have a loving three-legged dog that loves to visit the clinic.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I can't fully put into words how much I love this clinic. I've been bringing my pets to IHAC for over a decade and have never had a negative experience. When you walk into their lobby, you'll see hand written letters and even newspaper clippings that congratulate and thank the staff for all their hard work. And the atmosphere is always welcoming!

When one of my dogs passed away, Dr John kept the clinic open after hours so that we could cremate her with as little stress as possible. They even sent us a card to express their condolences. The fact that they would go out of their way to personally send me something has only solidified my loyalty to IHAC.

I currently have two dogs, and one of them has chronic allergy issues. We tried taking him to specialists all over OC, but no matter what we tried he wasn't getting better. A single appointment with Dr John had him put on a medication that cleared the issues up almost overnight! My dog also had issues with both ACLs in his knees. The surgery was expensive, but Dr John worked with my family to formulate a payment plan. We were encouraged to bring my dog in at any point in time during his recovery, and they even crated him a few times a week to make sure he was under observation when no one was home to watch him. Not once did I ever feel anxious while he wasn't at home--the staff are so incredibly gentle, and were careful of his needs.

They offer a grooming service once a week, and she's the only groomer I trust for my dog who now has difficulty getting up and off of high surfaces due to weak back legs. They are ALWAYS careful to pick him up and place him back down, and have extra staff ensure he doesn't slip off the grooming table while he's receiving a trim. And my dog loves them! He'll gladly follow them to the back room without looking to me even once.

Despite being a small, family owned clinic, IHAC has several services to offer, and can perform surgery on the spot if needed. They also perform chiropractic treatment, dental, and even acupuncture. I never have to take my dogs to outside specialists or to other vets to get a second opinion. Issues are identified right on the spot, and taken care of almost always during the same visit. They also offer vaccines at a discount on a specific day of the week--you can get your pups up to date in a matter of minutes, with no fuss and no waiting for the vet to get to your room. It's especially nice if you have a dog who's a bit anxious while visiting.

You'll never regret giving IHAC a chance.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS CROOK!  The Father and son are a SCAM!   It will cost your dog his health and your wallet $$$$$$.     He charges 6 times the medications that you tell the doctor you will accept.   I would not give even one star to these two crooks!!
Dr. Adam senior uses his fake charm by greeting you and taking nicely with a smile.... But don't be fooled, he will tell you a bunch of things your dog has wrong and your pet will suffer!!!!!     STAY AWAY!  If you don't at least be smart, question his medications and diagnoses!
Why the positive reviews boggles me!!!    He uses charm and smiles and that makes pet parents think he is knowledgable - which in fact he is looking to over medicate your pets and put a huge bill on your hand!     BE SMART ask questions and Google the meds and he never asked if my dog had any liver or kidney disease before prescribing the meds he did.    STAY AWAY THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE DECEPTIVE!</Review>

If you care about your pets, I'd recommend NOT taking them here.  Dr. Adams (senior) appears to only care about getting as much out of you wallet as he can, not about the well being of your pet.

Our cat suddenly became sick and we took her in.  We were told that she was dehydrated and they wanted to keep her overnight to give her an i.v. and to observe her.  That night turned into three, and every day we were told that she wasn't getting better, but if she stayed a little longer she'd recover.  On the fourth day they let us know she was about to die and we should come in.  She was gone before we could even make it to the office.  We were completely strung along so they could keep charging us for keeping our cat, while if the vet had been more honest with us we would have taken our cat home and let her pass in a more comfortable environment (or put her to sleep sooner so she wouldn't have to suffer).

Unfortunately, we gave this vet the benefit of the doubt about our cat that passed in their care and took our other cat there when it had what appeared to be a simple UTI.  After two weeks of antibiotics we were told to come in for a follow-up checkup, which became a chance to charge us for another set of tests (the cat appeared fine at this point).  The vets office was unresponsive to our calls for the test results, and when they finally talked to us about it we were treated to a simple "looks better, keep giving antibiotics, bye" as the vet rushed off.  Another week passed and our cat began to act ill again, albeit in a different way.  Took him back to be looked at and were told they have no idea what is wrong, get x-rays and bloodwork done for another $300 to find out.  When we asked the vet for more information as to what "could" be wrong, he basically shrugged and said if he knew he wouldn't recommend tests. We discussed that we can't afford this, and the vet pretty much just walked away; no discussion of why it was a good idea, no discussion of payment plans or possible price reductions.  This was typical of the vets demeanor every time we saw him, little to no discussion of why they needed to do what they were recommending, or what could be wrong with the pet.  As we left we were told we owed another $100 for the visit (where the vet spent 3 minutes with the cat and told us nothing) and the 2nd urine test (which we lead to believe was covered under the cost of the first urine test).  This was the final straw for us and have started going to a different vet.</text>

My family and I have been coming to Valley View Tires for over 15 years.  Adrian and his staff have always provided excellent service.  I like knowing that he will always put selling me good quality tires over the most expensive tires on the market.  That kind of caring can also be found in his staff. They always let you know if you need new breaks or tires and how long you can go before replacing them. And just in case someone gets outta line, Adrian's dad is there to keep everyone in line.< /Text>

Alignment comes with 60 day warranty which was a pleasant surprise. Staff was engaged and helpful.   Did not use any other services,  but would definitely return for other automotive  repair needs.<//Review><Rate>4<//Rate><resp>None< /resp><user_id>106036710825605744861</user_id></record>

My father and I purchased a 1966 Pontiac GTO from Tom and Nick. This seller has a huge and impressive inventory of collector cars. Nick was the gentlemen that showed me the vehicle I bought and found he's not your typical car salesman. He's very knowledgeable and was a pleasure to deal with. The day I picked up my car I got a glimpse of where they detail and service their vehicles. I was able to see the time and effort they put into their inventory. I don't normally leave reviews; however, I was so pleased with my purchase and my experience I felt I needed to.<//Review>

<review>Hi everyone, I've dealt with many people and I have quite a few cars and dealing with Vintage in Glendale from the start to the end of the deal was so excellent. If there was 10 stars I would give them a 10.
The communication is great. Every time I sent a note or called they came back to me and many times more than one person contacted me.
The have such a great selection of cars there and everything about them is so professional. I even mentioned they have a VW  Microbus that if they fix it a little they can get double the $$$ but they don't do that and they have some gems and I love the place and I totally trust them with any deal anytime.
thank you everybody there.

I got a great experience working with them, the staff were friendly and helpful.
I bought from them my Porsche 356 about 3 years ago and it still drives great.

I saw the 1953 Mercedes - Benz in their website and for real I didn't
want to go to CA from OH to check this car. I called them and spoke to
Tom, after he sent more pics of car, I realized that I wanted to buy
that car. I received the car and it is the same as in
photos and description. I will buy more cars from Vintage!</Text>

I got a fantastic bargain on an antique car through Vintage. Tom was easy to deal with and walked me through the whole process. I would recommend them to anyone else looking for a classic or antique car.</review>

Just picked up my 1959 Adenauer from Vintage Car Collector in Glendale and it looked amazing. I loved it! Helping me picking it up was just as nice as making the purchase. Overall had warm feelings throughout the transaction. Nice doing business with which is very appreciative. Thanks!</Text>

We contact them for a history book on the car and received it!! ( my husband was so happy about that)  That will be a great piece to keep with the car.

<text>Don’t waste your time, sent him detailed information and an 8 minute video of my 34k mile, unrestored, special-order Thunderbird that he didn’t even bother to look at. He responded less than 2 minutes later and said “it’s a few hundred dollar car”.

What a rude and insulting way to handle something by someone who claims to love and appreciate classic cars.< /text>< Rate>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>well i drove all the way from Arizona to california with a trailer after Tom & I spoke about this 1953 truck  and I specifically asked him if there were any issues and he said everything was great except the motor had a little noise due to sitting( text messages to prove it) , but when i got there it was NOT the truck he said it was( Thank God i didnt wire money prior to seeing the truck), so when i got there the truck was a rust bucket underneath being covered by touch up paint and the transmission was leaking terribly everywhere, the motor needed a complete re build, the door handle fell off when i shut the door, the guages didnt work, etc. So i talked to Tom and said you brought me all the way out here and lied to me, so i made him an offer to give him much less than what he was asking and he agreed to my price, it doesnt stop there, so his runner brings me the pink slip and the VIN # isnt even on the pink slip - it has the model # in the VIN # location HMMMMM yes thats correct, so i call Glendale PD and the officer said not to trust it and contact the Dept of motor vehicle - yes you guessed it, so i took a pic of the pink slip(yes i have photos) and went to the DMV and they said absolutely do not trust it. well im sure you know how this Story ends - I drove all the way back to Arizona with an empty trailer after all my expenses with Hotel costs, fuel cost and of course food costs. It doesnt stop there , i requested my deposit back of 500.00 through Ebay ( you would think he would at least return my deposit after all of that right ? ) well the answer is NO , i got a response today from ebay saying he would NOT return my deposit after ALL of that. So i have decided that if i can keep any of you from having to go through what I had to go through, than it would be worth posting my experience. STAY AWAY trust me<//text>< Resp>
{'time': 1560974182087, 'text': "Hi Jason, thank you for your review, although it's very un-thankful of you. We held the non-refundable deposit (as stated in the eBay description) for you so you could drive from AZ to CA (obviously, we knew you were coming, so why would we lie about the condition?), and when you came, you low-balled the price, we eventually gave in to your requests and met your price. I guess you were still not happy, because what followed was not any logical. Any classic car enthusiast knows that vintage cars could have their engine number, chassis number as its VIN on the title so what you were saying didn't make any sense. It is more laughable that the Police told you not to trust it, and they didn't bother to look into that? So are you saying they suspected it being stolen or something else and they just gave you a friendly warning? Are you talking about United States or a third-world country? C'mon now! This vehicle has now been sold at a higher price and has been successfully registered at the DMV, and no calls from the PD. By the way, the negative feedback you gave us on eBay (without even contacting us first) was removed right away by eBay after they reviewed this case for false feedback and following their rules. We return those deposits only when we have an agreement to do so prior the purchase. I understand you are doing all these to try to get back your deposit, but we are not going to negotiate with you about this. Anybody reading this will see the truth clearly!"}</Resp>

Beware buyers!  Tom sold me a car via eBay and he misrepresented it as a driver.  The photos were very selective and deceiving.  The car is more bondo than metal and I tried to contact Tom several times but he would not respond to me.  Don’t buy anything from this guy unless you inspect the car carefully.  He hides behind his disclaimers and even removed his ID from eBay so I could not leave a review!< /review>

<Text>The car was fraudulantly advertised as a Beautifully restored well cared for car. Lie the car had the most visibly knocking engine, bad wiring, no tail lights no turn signals the gauges don't all work the ignition switch fell off there is rust out the drivers door glass is broken . I could go on there is more but you get the idea. Beware this seller sells on eBay and has several dissatisfied customers</Text>< pictures>

Having problems registering the vehicle. I have been to DMV 6 times now with no resolve. The seller Tom of Vintage Car Collector is less than helpful, he has issues with the registration that he should be resolving so that the car can get registrated. I have paid over $1,200 to try and get the car registered. He showed the car in his description with a California license plate with a current year tag. Once the car was received it no longer had the license plate. I went to DMV and discovered the problems with the registration. DMV has asked for documentation that Tom of Vintage Car Collector says does not exist. He told me on multiple occasions to just talk to someone else at DMV and trust him there is no issue with the registration. He also grossly misrepresented the condition of the vehicle in his description. He also operates his business on EBay as gr8dayca. Please take caution. I don’t want anyone to end up in the same situation as me.<//Text>

<Review>Tom Adamyan and Vintage Motors of Glendale California soon to be under criminal investigation.
Stay away!!!!!!! Tom lies and sold me a junk car and he continues to deceive the public he /they will apologize on this review and do nothing .
The car is in dangerous condition , totally rotted and didn't even start on
pick up and delivery but Tom sent it anyway ,and took my money . He did not respond to my attorney. Let's see if he responds to the district attorney of Los Angeles and the police department for fraud.<//Review>< name>

They close at 7pm not 8pm like listed.
Drove over 20miles 30mins after calling for some ahole staff to give me attitude and tell me they're closed.
Save yourself the hassle and don't come here or come before 7.< /Text>

Me and my friend went in to buy some sweatshirts when we were approached by a man that works there ( white, brown hair that went to his shoulders, glasses ) and he asked what we were looking for and was being really friendly. My friend had picked out a thrasher t-shirt for her boyfriend, he went over to her, took the shirt and told us we have to leave. We had done nothing. Let's just say we will not be going back< /Text>

Riff house is plainly and purely brilliant.
The staff if awsome and professional and they always attend to what ever needs may arise in order for you to JAM!

"Hey you know any place with decent equipment and awesome rates?"

"Yes the Riff Haus."

It will be a place I will always recommend.</text>

the staff was nice but the food wasn't great. I've never had imitation crab meat at a Japanese restaurant. It was awful and the bowl wasn't good either it was not like the menu described with no veggies at all unless you count the one shredded carrot on top. I wouldn't recommend with overpriced items.< /Text>

I loved their omakase. All the dishes had nice flavor and the sushi was fresh. If you have time to enjoy the course meal, I definitely recommend their omakase.<//Text>

Good food and prices. The service is good, but not great. This is a good place for lunch. They are usually busy, but not packed. Getting a table usually doesn't require a wait.<//Review>

<text>I use to LOVE s this place but I just went and honestly ?? The prices went WAAAAY up and everything I ordered were fishy smelling which ruins the whole enjoyment
I know it’s fish but Fresh sushi should NEVER smell fishy ...
I will stick to Safeway’s ( actually really good if you order fresh) and some other restaurants I have found.... Sad I hope this was just an off day for them or they won’t stay open ... I only ate half of my food which to me is heartbreaking when you LOVE sushi!< /text>< pics>

The was my first visit and I was unsure what to order. The waitress gave me attitude for not being ready to order. She was very rude, tone of her voice was unfriendly and stiff. Like if I should already know about everything on their menu. Dragon rolls were good but the bento sushi rolls were not that great. She even forgot one of my order and try to argue with me about my order. Very rude.< /text>

< Review>
They quoted me $2 extra for brown rice instead of white rice. I grudgingly accepted even though it seemed a bit extortionate. After I ordered my meal they came back and said $2.50 more after I already agreed to the original price! They refused to budge even when I threatened to not have lunch there over that 50 cent difference! Insane! This was for a plain "side" of rice, mind you, not rice that was included as part of a recipe or anything - and it was a substitution for white rice - not a unique, separate order. They're trying to charge a quarter of the price of the meal for something that literally costs them about 2 cents! No use in having a "lunch special" at that point! Restaurants typically charge about $1 for the trouble or have no charge for brown rice substitute. I ended up having lunch at Chef Li next door where they have NO EXTRA CHARGE for brown rice substitution! What a difference!</Review>

<Review>Great assortment of sushi. Portions are filling and colorfully plated. Their bento boxes are tasty as well as their other Japanese fare. Their service is exceptional in that I've never had a long wait for my meal, even when the restaurant is full, which it always is at lunchtime. Parking is a problem because it's in a shopping center and shares the parking lot with other popular eateties.</Review><GmapID>0x808e345a46b5b751:0x63d7fe74cca44609<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The highlight of our San Jose trip.
Fantastic service. Very polite server who didnt miss a beat. Reasonably priced and some of the best sushi we've ever had. No one is ever mad about $1 sake, either.< /text>

This little sushi spot is a gem!  We order pickup here at least once a month.  Love the rainbow roll, and sushi is always fresh.  My wife gets the bento box with korean bbq, teriyaki salmon, and tempura rolls.  Highly recommend to anyone nearby or passing through the area! A+< /Review>

My favorite was tempura prawns..
New management I here?
Well everything was not crispy panko tried!! It was undercooked and soggy. Including panko fried vegee's! It was bad really bad!
It was starchy uncooked panko crust! I was so very ...Very disappointed!
To much big chunks of seaweed in soup.
Miso flavor was not enough.disappointed
Salad had very until tomatoes slice and no cucumber slices! Just a big clump of lettuce chunks a very few shredded carrots. Very disappointed again.
Where's the big yummy gyoza! Now was six s small looks like frozen in a bag gyoza!.
What happened to my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood! I won't be back after ten years at least!
New Management indeed cannot be the same people!< /Text>< Time>

This place used to be in Mountain View and called Sura Sushi. They’ve moved to Campbell now and I think the quality has gone down. The sushi we tried had too much rice and not enough taste. Probably won’t visit again</Text>

<time>1620420336664< /time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Very unprofessional service. Customer service lady was very rude and ordering process was was extremely uncomfortable. The ladys name was yazmin. Apart from complaining about random irrelevant issues of her day she was more worried about her car being detailed instead of attending her clients. She also upped the price and switched items according to her liking... Very dissatisfied customer experience I will NOT BE COMING BACK.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1620763830140, 'text': 'Dear Gerardo,    we always treat our customer with respect.  I have spoken to Yazmin and we know you might have been frustrated due to a few thing. You were told that you needed to place your order online in order to pick up instore (This is stated on our website and online) Then you were asked not to smoke near the entrance door because the smoke was coming into the office. As for the price increase, were out of stock on a ink set you originally wanted,  but you were told of the price difference for getting the other brand. Maybe it was hard to hear with the PPE protection in the doorway. If there is any other concern please let me know. We would be glad to address any complaints our customer have. Thank you..WWTS'}</Resp>

I ordered a set of tattoo ink and never got it. Apparently they would rather people get tattoo supplies at a residence instead of at the tattoo shop. I needed this set 9f ink and now not.only do I not have the ink I have to wait God knows how.long to get a refund. The address I wanted it shipped to is the shop address. 467 N Dixie Blvd
Radcliff, KY
40160
The fact that Noone contacted me to tell me hey, that ink you're expecting is the coming. I left my phone. Number. Why would you have me leave my phone number if you aren't going to use it. I've lost business and delayed business over this and you act like it's my fault when most companies won't even s
Ship to a home address. You guys need to take a look at you're SOP and come up with something a little more intelligent.</Review>

<Text>Steer clear! I ordered 2 tubes of H2Ocean Nothing Pain Relieving Soap. Very quickly, I realized the price was a ripoff, shipping was also almost as much as the 2 tubes, and I found a local shop selling for much cheaper. I went to their website and was relieved to see that my order status hasn't changed and was still new. They do NOT have a way to cancel on their website except to call or email. I did both. I emailed multiple times. I called multiple times and nobody picked up so I left messages. I checked back the next day when I saw they never replied, or called me back. It said they shipped my stuff! I emailed them more, no answer. Called more and left messages, no answer or return call. Finally, someone answered, and claimed they didn't receive any of my emails or calls, and that if have to eat the costs since it was already shipped. Very unhelpful customer service. Stay away from these guys!

Cons:
High prices
Outrageous shipping
Bad customer service
No way to cancel orders

The delivery was prompt and when there was an issue with my mailing address option I was contacted promptly to correct it. The various products I have order held up to high quality expectations. The order filling was also precise. I will be a returning customer.</Review>< pics>

I called UPS yesterday and went to their main hub here in MD to try and track my order. They can’t track it and even said it may still be in CA.

Also US mail takes everything to there sorting facility where they eventually scan it in later that evening. US MAIL is not a gaursnteed service.

I haven't even yet received my first shipment of products from this company and I can't wait to write this review! I placed my order a couple days ago and everything went together without any problems. The very next day I received a phone call from them explaining that one of the products I ordered was out of stock and the website mistakenly let me order it anyways. Instead of asking if they could back order the product or refund me for it, they immediately offered to replace it with a comparable product but after checking on the website with what they replaced it with I found it to be much more expensive than what I had originally ordered. I'm thrilled with their level of customer service, they've gained a customer for life!< /review>

UPDATED- After multiple unanswered emails, I did receive a response with a tracking number for the replacement items. I do think the entire situation was handled improperlybut I'm just happy to finally have what I ordered, and to have them meet the standards that I originally expected.
Original review-
Just received my order. One of the three bottles of ink I order was expired and missing it's original safety seal,and one of the blister packs of needles was unsterilized based upon the ethylene oxide processed color indicator.  I contacted customer service and understand mistakes happen....so hopefully I will be able to update this to a higher rating after they find a solution.< /Review>

I ordered and machine and it was used filthy tampered with and didn't even work I asked for a refund and the didn't give me it back or even offer to give me a new machine.  This is the worst site I will ever order anything from . I am now out 180$ for investing in my tattoo equipment.  I spent my worked hard earned money to get a machine that is not only dirty but doesn't even work . They have bad customer service and poor respect for customers. When I asked for refund and to be placed on the phone with someone else she laughed at me . I hope nobody ever has to deal with this experience.<//review>

{'time': 1538763004567, 'text': 'Dear Mua, I saw that you purchase the machine on Sept 9th. We accept return up to 30 days of purchase but they have to be in Original New condition. I personally looked at the machine you sent back to us and it was not in new condition. The machine was used and out of tune. I had my tech look at it and there is short in the machine, so we can fix it and have it sent back to you.  The coil covers were also taken off the machine and exposed the copper coils. We can only accept returns on products that are not used and working condition. My employees treated you respectfully and was able to offer to repair the machine for you but cant accept the return. She told me that your phone cut off when you were talking to her. So if you would like we can still offer the repair service. Thank you again and have a great day.. WWTS'}</Resp>

So i messed up my address but contacted the company as soon as i realized it. The lady called me back cussing me out and telling me I'm gonna have to pay all this money for the mess up. Then the item never came at all to me and now she is refusing me my refund. Im taking legal action. I don't recommend this company to anyone ever.<//review>

Honestly this place needs Zero Stars! Horrible customer service! Don't return calls for days! Ordered their Thermal Fax that was suppose to be just like 3M.  I paid close to $1000 with shipping an the extended warranty.  So I had 4 yr warranty on it.  It had to go back numerous times a year.  I had pay shipping to and from each time. That was like $120 to send and come back) So I paid another $1000 in shipping of rate extended warranty returns! I think in 5 years we had 4 different machines. None of them worked more than a hot minute! The last one they shipped me I was told by Fred that it was a whole new revamped model! HA! It last 1 month! and its worst its ever been! DO NOT USE this company! Also its been mentioned anyone can get stuff from this place not just professionals! The best new Thermal Fax is sold by King Pin. Its made in Europe and works flawless! Kingpin is best company and stands behind what they sell!</Text>

I am very upset with this company. I spent $376.19 with this company. I ordered my things in march and it is now June I haven't yet received my order . That they say was set on my door step without a signature on arrival.  They don't even plan on fixing  there mess up . You don't leave almost 400.00 on someone's front porch to get took<//Review>

have order from them several times and it was ok.. but this last time i was missing and item and most of the disposables had holes in the packaging meaning they are useless,,, when i spoke to costumer service they had the nerve to tell me everything shipped ok and to double check!! as if i missed the only ink bottle i order and the freaking disposable tubes weren't all opened... they completely stopped answering   and denied a refund or to ship what i paid for.. will differently recommend king pin or tatsoul over them anytime after this customer service experience.< /text>

<Text>i would not give this place half of a star, i ordered a chest rest chair, and the thing costed me 211.00 dollars, only because they charged me 82.00 for shipping, when amazon got the same thing thru them as well and shipping in only 23.00 and they dont want to match the price and give me the money back,when what amazon carries is thru world wide tattoo as well.  not only the money, but my chair got here all scratched up, NO wheels, and box was all beat up it had like a pound of tape around the box, no signature required for drop off when i paid extra for that.  i sent them pictures of my chair, the base and box were all beat up and they are trying to blame it on USPS when the issue started in the ware house by not supervising properly the items before the boxes get shut to be send. im very upset with this situation. they are quick to mess orders but no one answers my emails or calls about this issue. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER HERE.<//Text>< pics>

Very  disappointed with this company. I would NOT recommend them unless you want to prank someone into have a horrible experience with online shopping! I spent about $750.00 and my package had a  sealed sticker ripped in half with a new one placed over it, the boxes where in horrible shape with dents scratches and dirt all over them so I called the company to see if they could replace the package and I got the  runaround when I finally got a answer they said I have to pay for the delivery of the replacement after I payed them $35.50 for UPS Ground S/H fee. Don't waist your time!< /Review>

{'time': 1492645316766, 'text': 'We tried our best to help you. You got 3 Cheyenne Products that were all sealed original products from Cheyenne. I am sorry the outside Cheyenne box was not perfect and flawless.  We get them from Cheyenne and they ship them in big boxes with 30+ pieces together. Cheyenne comes from Germany and boxes and packaged get stacked and moved around during shipping. This will cause the boxes inside to get pressure which will cause some damage to the seal. The boxes are not shrinked wrapped so the boxes will rub against each other and the outside package of the box will not be perfect.  As for the dust, they do get shipped from Cheyenne warehouse and then placed in our warehouse.  Both of our warehouse are not Dust Free i am sorry to say so you might get some dust on your outside box. But all products are Brand New Sealed inside the Cheyenne Box.\n\nCustomer called and wanted a complete new package because he was not happy with what the outside packaging looked like without opening it.\n\nWe told him we would be glad to offer an exchange but he would need to pay for the shipping to us and we would pay for the shipping to him.  We thought this to be fair because he got Brand New Products but was just not happy with the way the outside box looked.'}</Response>

Due to billing address issues not matching the shipping address your order get held for more verification. I am sorry no one got back to you sooner. It was 4th of july weekend and we were closed for the holidays.\n\nI did speak to the rep handling your order and was told that you just wanted to cancel it.  If you would still like to process it i can speak to her. We are sorry for the hassle, we just do this to insure there is no credit card fraud.\n\nThanks.. WWTS'}<//Response>

<text>Currently dealing with a nightmare of a situation on a refrigerator we purchased from Howard's appliances 3 years ago. We purchased a Samsung refrigerator for over $3k plus the extended warranty as we gotten a few items from them in the past. Two weeks ago our freezer went out so we called Howards to come out and fix the freezer. It took them 10 days to finally send someone out and that was after many phone calls.
Well the guy showed up today and completely ruined the rest of the fridge and now the refrigerator part has quite working as well! The guy seemed to know nothing about the appliance and now we can't store any food (great timing too! With everything going on).
Now Howard's is saying they can't replace the refrigerator for another 10 days. This is unacceptable and will not spend anymore money here.</text>< pics>

Mike was extremely helpful in assisting us with the purchase of a refrigerator and a ranger.  We changed our minds several times in the process, and he was extremely patient in changing the paperwork process, accommodating our requests.  The prices are competitive and the services are very good.  Highly recommended<//Review>

Customer Service Fair

What I like about Howard's is that their representatives are knowledgeable        about everything in their store.   What I liked about Michael is that he shows you how each feature  of an appliance works.  You do not get this kind of attention or knowledge from the sales forces at Lowe's, Home Depot, etc.  It's because I got this attention that I decided to give Howard's my business.  Delivery and installation was easy breezy.  Many people today in retail do not know what they have in their store, nor can they tell you anything about it.  I like to be  educated. I am a happy camper with the refrigerator, washer and dryer.  The third installation of my oven hood did not go as well.  The requisition of the installation was not received by Howards' subcontractor, (Longs) so the installation did not happen on the day it was supposed to.  When Longs did not call to tell me when they were coming, I knew something was wrong. When the subcontractor arrived the next day he spent 2-1/2 hrs trying to install my oven hood and finally said there was a manufacturer's defect of the product.  The next day another installer came with another hood and was able to install it.   This simple process ended up wasting 3 of my days.  Plus Michael did not tell me about an installation fee. I thought this was all included.   I initially gave a 5 star review but for these reasons I downgraded them to 3 stars.<//text>

<GmapID>0x80c2c4e2a3d7ebad:0x6a82516fb2b79db0< /GmapID><Text>Howard's had provided very disappointing and dissatisfied services. I ordered a set of washer and dryer. I was offered $69.95 for delivery, installation and haul away with one price. The sales rep assured me that in the event if there are any problems with installation, the team will go back and finish the job. The sales rep failed to inform me that it is charged by the trip, not by the job.

So, when the delivery came, the delivery team that supposedly installed the machine informed me that there is a problem with shutting off the valve which requires a plumber to come in. So I hired a plumber and paid another $69.95 to have Howard's to come back to install the units the next day.  When the plumber came I was informed the valve was perfectly functioning and nothing needs to be replaced. While my plumber was there, Howard's second installation team came back and install my units without any problems.

I called Howard's several times to complaint and tried to resolve the situation. The Howard's Alhambra branch manager told me this is out of their hands because delivery and installation team belongs to a third party. I called the delivery department and they want my plumber to provide written proof to indicate the valve condition.

I understand it is my responsibility to paid for the service that I need. But now it is the words of my plumber vs the words of Howard's first installation team.  While my plumber and Howard's second installation team both said the valve is functioning, isn't that is enough to prove something?

I WILL NOT, WILL NOT go back to Howard's again.</Text>< username>

Just want to thank Asst General Manager Michael Rodriguez at the Howard’s in Alhambra. I was concerned of staying within our budget and was very happy with the wide variety of selections offered. Michael was very patient while my mom looked at each item until she found the right stove, and ended up buying a washer and dryer too. Thanks again<//Review>

Howard’s had Speed Queen washing machines, which shopping online had convinced us was what we wanted. The clerk was very helpful, answering our questions, but being discreetly desirably distant ehen we were discussing model choice and prices among ourselves. We chose the delivery date; they called us with a 3-hr window (not a half or full day!) the day before. They called again 1 hr before and 30 min before they arrived, which was right in the middle of the window. Our daughter and son-in-law, who were subbing for us as receivers, reported no problems with the delivery and installation, nor with removal of the old machine.  . . . Oh, one more thing - we ordered the machine in a city that was 60 miles away and in a different county than the delivery, and there was no additional charge.<//text>

Came in to purchase a Refrigerator.  Everyone was very welcoming and very friendly. Miguel assisted us and he really knew his stuff. He was very informative, he knew all the features and helped me make a decision that I feel good about.  We'll  probably  be back soon for one of the beds he showed us! Thanks Howard's!</review>

<review>Great merchandise, great selection, great service, great parking, great sized store with so many appliances and mattresses to choose from. Unlike "worst buy" with limited appliances and so many useless junk and accessories for sale by depressed teenaged charlatans, "Howard's" have everything organized and on display for you to open and press with experts who can cheerfully help you! You can avoid the crowds by going weekdays.</review>< Pics>

I have caretaking duties so I can't easily go appliance shopping.  My refrigerator had issues that could not be fixed.  I called Howards with the size of the opening it must fit into and Mike directed me to ones on their website that would fit.  This was late Friday and I had a new refrigerator delivered the next afternoon.  I've also bought a new washer from them the same way.  "This is the space I have; which washer will fit."</text>

<review>Howards Alhambra, California has a wonderful sales person thete named Cara. I wanted a mattress which was no longer available in this store. She the took the time to locate one for me and had it shipped to the store at no extra cost.  She gave me a magnificent deal. Definitely visit this location for your appliance needs.< /review>< user>

My visit to Howard's was great, Cary Ho greeted me as soon as I walked in the door, asked me what my needs were, directed me towards what I was looking for and let me browse until he noticed I had some questions, he didn't hesitate to come over and educate me on the appliance, his information was very informative and efficient, after fully explaining the warranty and the delivery process, i was sold, Cary Ho knew his stuff and he explained so easily so that I could understand exactly what was going to happen, I would recommend this location to friends and family, and if you get a chance, Cary Ho is the go to guy. Thank you for the help and for the new refrigerator.<//Review>

Horrible delivery, they delayed our order multiple times, and finally one day they called at 8pm (seriously) to deliver our appliances which they failed to deliver because our street was "narrow" although Waste Management trucks which are pretty wide go though with no problem. Obviously the delivery person was feeling lazy at night.</Text>

We bought two (2) HDTVs and a 65 inch stand (all brand new in the box---no open boxes or floor models...paid full price) last week. Asked salesman if he matches price with proof...he said yes...showed him photo of same model from Costco...said he can't as last digit is different...says Costco gets their own TV supply from Samsung with modified model number so Howards does not have to match price. Salesperson took his time to check with warehouse to make sure items are in stock and ready for delivery. Took our order and set up our delivery. Delivery came early on day promised. Delivery men brought in stand ALREADY ASSEMBLED...and SCRATCHED!!! Told delivery men that we bought brand new stand in the box and we were going to put it together as told to us by salesman ("stand is easy to put together---just like IKEA)...showed copy of delivery slip with HAND WRITTEN "OB" (out of box) on slip. Delivery men were shown copy of our PAID receipt showing all new items, Deliver men called the warehouse manager and was told by her (mgr) that this is the last one, a floor model that is scratched...you can talk with salesman and re-order on in the box...but don't know when it will come in. Warehouse manager hee-hawed around and asked what we wanted to do...what percent discount we wanted...etc. Called back to complain to store manager...said he would look into matter and get back to us---we are still waiting...since last week Thursday. Called to inform salesman of situation...initially seemed like he did not know what was going on then said, "You got your $82 discount for pre-assembly"---how did he know the discount we got if he had no knowledge of the situation? Very fishy. Maybe a call to the BBB is in order. Better watch out when you buy NEW ITEMS and get some scratched used item. Very disappointed in the unethical manner Howard's salespeople are displaying...BUYER BEWARE. This is the first time this has happened and we have been buying from Howards for the past 30 years.</text>

Horrible. You’re not allowed to ship meds to a different address other than you’re billing address. Completely ridiculous considering many people have to live in different cities than their billing address is located. Especially in the middle of a pandemic. Not understanding or flexible. I ordered medicine for my cat that she needs ASAP but I cannot have it delivered because my billing address is in a different state. So I had to cancel my order and now I have to re-order from somewhere else and this has wasted several days, now she’s out of her medication.
Time to update policies guys. You need to be more flexible for people who have different circumstances. Not willing to work with you or make adjustments. Shameful.<//Text>

<Date>1600279033333<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Ordering my pets rx's from California Pet Pharmacy has been one of the most unbelievably awesome customer service experiences of my life! Seriously, from start to finish it was amazing. My vet was not very cooperative getting the prescriptions to CPP. I was under a time crunch to get the prescriptions for my dog. Each time I call to see if my vet had faxed the information to CPP every person I talked with was so very helpful. It was so refreshing that I spoke with someone who not just spoke English, but understood it very well. Every time I called the associate only required my phone number and had all the information they needed to help with my issue. I didn't get transferred to another department, put on hold so they could figure out what was going on, it was so efficient! And even after my veterinarians two-day delay getting the information to CPP, my products arrived on time. It was truly an amazing experience. And on top of that I got three month supply of my dogs medication and supplements for the cost of one month supply with my veterinarian. Tell me I'm not a happy camper!!!!!!!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME92LGlV8C-FQf2hk6yYZF9bSAMb7KnbS6ZK7S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8IcjciZQaA8Nqrk_qzgziTkDLBs68UlW5dc9P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I wish I could give 0 stars but they won't let you post with 0. Do not shop here. They don't date the medication correctly. I bought 12 months of heart worm medicine on October 9, 2017. The Rx on the front of the package indicated that the pills would expire in March of 2019: however, I failed to notice (due to not giving them while wearing my readers) that the inner blister packs are dated exp 3/18. A 12 month supply that was only good for 5 months. I guess Kuar Singh (the guy who filled the Rx) can't tell an 18 from a 19 and it may be the costliest mistake ever for me. I will NEVER purchase anything for my dog from this place ever again. I now have to get my dog heart worm tested again in a few months. Don't let what happened to me, happen to you. My dog is almost 12. I pray he doesn't have worms because of this.<//text>< Rating>

Wish I could give ZERO STARS!  I ordered over $200 in meds for my 14 yo dog and when I received the package, 1 of the medications was missing. I called customer service and spoke to Hailey. She had no idea how to handle this. She spoke to management & they wanted a picture of the packing slip & of the medication. How either of these items prove that I didn't receive the medication, I have no idea but I did it. When I was speaking with her, I asked to speak to a manager & no one would get on the phone. I called back and spoke to Sienna - very nice & helpful.  Now the medication I should have received is OUT OF STOCK because it shipped to someone else & I have to wait until tomorrow for it to ship and they will only do 2 day shipping because it still 'falls into the window of the original shipping time' BUT if it was in the package with the others, I WOULD HAVE IT ALREADY! I spoke to manager VINCE OCHOA who was snotty and unhelpful & told me if I wanted upgraded shipping, I would have to pay for it. RIDICULOUS!<//review>

<Review>Shipping is ridiculous. I ordered 3 bags of dental chews that I used to buy through my vet. I bought 3 bags because they're a good price. Originally shipping was a little less than $7. The pharmacy emailed me and said due to the weight of the item they would have to charge me an extra $10 to ship it. They don't weigh that much. Each bag is about 18 oz which is a little over 1 lb. That's a $17 shipping charge for about ~ 3.5lbs.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I always order online my pet’s medications, they have good prices and excellent customer service. The medications have high quality and they always send asap, you wait basically the time for the shipment you chose. For refil you have your account with the rx and previous orders. I rightly recommend.<//review>

Everyone was Out of Stock including my vet. These guys, not only had the medication, but their customer service told me that they will continually call my vet to get them to approve the prescription ASAP know this is a very hard-to-get yet life-saving medication.  Another pharmacy claimed to go out of stock by the time my vet responded 3 days later. So that is how I came across CA Pet Pharmacy.  They kept on my vet and in 2 hours, my vet approved the prescription. Love their Customer Service people.  Caring and fully understood my predicament.<//review>

<text>Hard to order and hard to communicate with. I talked to them 3times in one week just for a refill. Mistake was made in quantity and even after talking to vet, wouldn't fix it. Now I have to call every week for a refill. But won't let you order more than 5 days out even though it takes a week and half to get to you. Always a laspe in medications.< /text>< Date>

I've had great experiences with California Pet Pharmacy and have used them for 2-3 years now. I order Bravecto and Interceptor Plus chews for my dogs and Revolution Plus for my cat. I also order Dasuquin with MSM and Icelandic Sardine/Anchovy Fish Oil. They have always reached out to my vet for prescription, approved and shipped quickly. I have never had an issue and had good experiences. I can recommend using this company. For some reviews I read saying charges being pulled, you are given the option for auto-ship or one time ship. I always do one time ship. I'm assuming those people did auto-ship and then complained. Just pay attention and choose which one you want. I have also compared prices with other companies and found California Pet Pharmacy to be the cheapest.<//text>

<review>Every other local vet and online pet pharmacy was out-of-stock, but I found my dog's hard-to-find heart medicine at CPP!  CPP worked quickly with my vet and they offer his Rx at a good price.  Refilling the Rx is easy and always arrives in good shape and in a timely fashion.  I’m very happy with CPP..</review>< username>

CPP has the best prices and they ship very quickly (and will overnight if it's needed that quickly).  I have been using them for over two years and they have never disappointed me with pricing or with getting back to me with any questions I may have.  They will also reach out to your Vet if needed too.  Appreciate their prompt service and great prices!<//review>

Every month that I order with them I have to deal with unnecessary delays caused by their antiquated process. It takes 1-3 (!!) days for them to process the order, and THEN they ship it. So when you PAY for 2-3 day shipping, it is actually 6 (!!!!) days OR MORE before the medication will actually arrive. Speaking to people on the phone is insufferable.  It doesn't seem like they have a clue what is going on.< /Text>

I have been ordering from this site for years and have always ordered the same thing and used the $100 to get free shipping. Now they want to charge you $10 because it evidently reached a ghostly weight that they now have to charge you. It defeats the purpose of ordering for free shipment.<//text>< Pics>

(Editing review: they eventually shipped this about a week after original ship date.)
This place takes forever to ship. If you need medication for your pet in a timely manner, it won’t happen. They “shipped” my order 4 business days ago and it still hasn’t even scanned into USPS.
I reside in the same state as this company, which should be a 1-2 day transit point at most.</review>

<text>I used to order my pet meds from Ali vet and they were out one time so I started ordering from California pet pharmacy and for years they have been good and this last year they have had  terrible customer service, I have been lied to time and time again I last month had to go buy from someplace else because they lied to me about when my shipment was sent, it ended up much later so I ordered 3 weeks in advance this time to make sure I would get in time,, I've been lied to now 4 times and my medication for my cat that has to have it every day has still not been sent and I got another message that they don't have the medication once again late today as once again they promised it would be mailed today.. I do not know what has happened to this company in the last year or who has taken control but I am going to look into going back to ALI VET or check in to chewy.com or PETMEDS.COM online pharmacy. I'M ANGRY 😠 AND DISAPPOINTED IN THE FACT MY CAT HAS NO MEDS AND THEY HAVE LIED AGAIN! I WORK FOR AN AIRLINE AND I DEAL WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DAILY AND I WON'T EVER SEND ANOTHER PERSON THEIR WAY AGAIN!! // /I'M UPDATING MY REVIEW AS I WAS CONTACTED BY A SUPERVISOR AND HE MADE THINGS RIGHT SO I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER FROM THEM AND HOPE THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BACK ON TRACK TO HOW THEY USE TO BE!<//text>< pics>

Prices used to be good, but this no longer seems to be the case. Additionally, their service seems to have really gone down hill over the last year or so. Slow to fulfill orders, slow to respond to emails, and LONG waits to speak with some on the phone. Not worth the aggravation if you have critical medications.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Wish I could give zero stars.  California Pet Pharmacy customer service is worse I've ever dealt with.  Completely unresponsive and irresponsible.  They do not deal in good faith and don't deliver.  I have used them in the past with no problem, but this time has been a complete nightmare.  Ordered Vetmedin for my dog on 12/6/2020.  Ordered two bottles for $103.98.  At this writing medicine hasn't arrived and they can offer no explanation.  This is a much needed medicine for my dog and their cavalier attitude is beyond reproach.  They suggested I buy some extra until the shipment I ordered from them arrives, if it ever does.  Well obviously since my dog needs this medicine I had to do just that, at the tune of $75.  Needless to say I will not use California Pet Pharmacy anymore, as they are definitely not a reliable or very reputable company. On Dec 15, I was told a manager would be contacting me on 12/17/2020 with  an update.  It's now 12/22/2020 and I've yet to hear from anyone.  I have since reached out to my credit card company to dispute the charge and have been given a provisional credit.  Just a word of caution to anyone using this company for vital pet meds, beware and make sure you have adequate backup because your order may never arrive.  At least I can count on my credit card company to retrieve my monies, as California Pet Pharmacy refused to issue refund or resend order.</Review><response>None<//response>< user_name>

< Review>
I used to purchase all of my dog's prescriptions from CVS (and he is on A LOT of them) but switched to California Pet Pharmacy after a family member told me about them a few years ago. I am SO glad I made the switch. On one prescription alone, I used to spend $300+/month for it at CVS and get it for under only $42 from CPP. Their customer service is responsive and the savings are well worth it! I highly recommend.</Review>

Well it’s over a week and I still don’t have my meds. I paid for the 2-3 day delivery. I like many called them only to leave messages that they NEVER returned. My poor fur baby is just hanging on. No pharmacy in Seattle area has it in stock, so there is nothing I can do. I’ve emailed them and they responded will it was just mailed. Only thing I will do now is contact BBB and file complaint.

< Review>
Customer Service does not have the ability to resolve any issues and has no knowledge regarding the medication they are filling. I ordered my Equine medication through here, and this will be my last time.  I ordered my horses mediation a week in advance, only one medication needed approval for a refill, the other could have been shipped. I called on day 4 of still not hearing anything regarding my medication shipping. Customer Service told me they could not ship just one medication at a time, because that would indicate two orders not one. I asked them to split the order and ship the mediation I was low on, customer service told me they can't because customers want it shipped together, even though I am the customer? I asked if they could ship out the one medication and express ship as they have taken so long to fill my order with no communication, they declined and told me I would have to pay for it. I asked to speak to a manager, I was told they were on lunch at 1:30pm, a week later, still no phone call from a manager. I am convinced they don't have a manager on site, or they don't care. Needless to say, my horse ran out of medication, and it was a medication you can not skip, and despite their "policy" of filling orders within 24-48 hours, this did not happen, and they had no ability to problem solve. Highly unprofessional.

Easy solution would have been: When an employee see's an order needs an approval from a vet and they can't be reached, is to call the customer and let them know they are waiting on that. Perhaps they could get ahold of their vet faster to get it taken care of. THEN, while they are waiting on approval, ask the customer if they would like one of the medications shipped in the mean time, because typically if an animal is on a medication, they need it sooner than later.
To make things right with the customer, they should have expressed shipped the one medication that was truly important, and apologize for the lack of communication.

Don't recommend getting medications form this place, unless maybe you are getting preventatives and even at that, if you ran into an issue, they wouldn't be able to fix it.< /Review>

<text>BUYER BEWARE!!!

In January 2020, I ordered and paid for a 12 month supply of Tri-Heart Plus chewable tablets for dogs from California Pet Pharmacy.

Because CPP didn't have an adequate supply on hand with expiration dates far enough into the future, I only received a 6 month supply and a promise that the remaining 6 month supply would be mailed to me in 6 months.

I didn't receive the balance that was owed to me. I contacted CPP four times in mid to late August and received no response whatsoever.

I ended up having to order these meds from another pharmacy to keep my dog current. And I haven’t received a refund for the meds I did not receive.< /text><UserId.>109715764505580573071<//UserId.>< Rate>

<Review>UPDATE:  They've since credited my account for the shipping charges but it took negative reviews to get them to do it.
Very disappointed.  I placed an order and paid for expedited shipping ($9.99 for 2-3 day shipping).  They emailed me on a Tuesday and told me it shipped and provided the tracking number.  It did not arrive until the following Monday.  It should have arrived by Friday, latest.  I called them on Wednesday to let them know that they did not process the shipping correctly (based on the tracking and ETA) and they agreed and said maybe it would arrive on Friday, if not they could refund my shipping amount.  When I contacted them about it again to get the refund, they would not refund the expedited shipping amount!   Things go wrong, I understand that but it's how you deal with it once it goes wrong.  They could have easily rectified this mistake.  Horrible service!  I do not recommend using CPP!  I will not use them ever again.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>You are better off going with any other company than this one.  They have horrible policies and super lousy sales and support.  I talked to one two days after placing an order and was told I would he would cancel the order (My dog was dying and needed the meds immediately)to only be charged a $10.00 cancellation fee.

<review>UPDATE to a negative review left yesterday.

I received an email apologizing for poor communication and explaining the delay in shipping my item.

Due to product not being in stock, I was able to respond to the email and cancel my order and request a refund. They immediately responded and confirmed my cancellation and told me when I could expect the refund.

The refund showed up in my account today.

I’m not sure if I will do business again, but after my negative reviews, they communicated with me and worked through the problem.<//review><date>1598026214682< /date>< resp>

Unfortunately the product I ordered from them never arrived. After I contacted customer service for help, their answer is standard - USPS says they delivered so nothing we can do. I did pay a lot for the product I ordered for my dog and never got to use it. No refund is offered, no new shipment to replace the lost item... Nothing!
Took me over a week communicating with them and still just a time wasted after all the back and forth. Stay away from them as they are definitely not gonna help you should something happen to your order after it's out their door! You are better off with Chewy or amazon. Sad< /review>

The best company I've ever had the pleasure of repeatedly doing business with. Their customer service is second to none, and it's nice to know that someone still believes that the customer is always right. They've exceeded every expectation I had about an online pet supply company, & I recommend them to everyone with furry, finned, or feathered family members..also slithery and scaled ones too!</review>

Your pet is NOT their biggest concern. That is a FACT. Use any other pet pharmacy as they are too focused on their bottom line instead of your pet's needs.</Text>

Shipping is fast without costing a fortune; their website is easy to search and navigate, and their selection is great! Customer service is friendly and helpful, although I haven't needed them often.  Their prices generally beat out other vendors as well.  I've been a loyal customer for over two years now and plan to continue!< /text>

I ordered two prescriptions for my dog (furosemide and Deramaxx). I received the medications (two bottles with appropriate labels) but....wait for it...the SAME medication in both bottles!!  Brilliant

After phone calls and emails (with pictures of the pills), the pharmacist tells Brandy (c/s) that they accidentally sent me two bottles of furosemide and will send the Deramaxx. I point out that I'm pretty sure it's the opposite case and when they double check the picture I sent, WHOOPS! Yes, the pharmacist was wrong again. If you're keeping score at home, they WOULD have send me 3 orders of Deramaxx and 0 of furosemide.

They get that cleared up and say that they will indeed actually send me the furosemide but then...they send me a return label for the Deramaxx.  Really? They can't resell it, but they insist I return it so they can throw it out. I try to point out that it would make a whole lot of sense to let me keep it for all my trouble, but no. Jennifer, the "C/S manager"  says I have to send it back, but if I want to keep it they will give me 20% off - I cannot make this stuff up.

I ask Jennifer how long they've been in business, her response "years." I ask who she reports to, she responds the "owner," but when pressed for his/her name she "can't tell me that." When asked what governing agency regulates them, I again get "I can't tell you that." When I ask if it might be the FDA, she replies "yeah!" enthusiastically.

Needless to say, I will be following up with formal complaints with the appropriate governing agencies.  I would NOT be surprised if the medications were completely bogus and hope to send in samples for testing.</Review>< Time>

I've had nothing but amazing experiences with CPP. In most cases, everything arrived on time and just as expected. But, even when things have come up they are AMAZING at handling. I'm impressed every time I contact them</Review>

They take forever to call your vet and ship. Had to call 6 times for the darn meds to ship and they’re still taking their sweet time. Last time for me.</Text>

The prices are the best online. They confirmed my vet within 24 hours and I had the scrips in 2 days. I read between the lines on those negative posts and blew them off. Glad I did. A+ service.<//text>

<Text>I do not recommend this place, because they are very dishonest they have taken $10.00 from my credit card without my authorization,
the problem was that my dog's veterinarian disappeared and I could not get a prescription for medication ordered 24 hours before, I've had to explain this to them but they don't want to reimburse my $ 10.00 back, please take care with this company when you use a credit card. Still waiting for reimbursement😪<//Text><name>Joseito Lacayo< /name>< Resp>

I would give 1/2 star but it doesn't give me that option. I ordered 2 gallons of Grannicks Bitter Apple to spray on pea gravel to keep my dog from eating it. My wife ordered 16 bottles, which the website said was in stock. Overnight delivery was an extra $35.00. The order was accepted by the company and my wife received an order #. Later she received an email saying it had to be brought in from another supplier because they didn't keep that much in stock. The email said she could pay another $50.00 dollars shipping ( now a total of $85.00 shipping ) and get it the next day. The supervisor promised if we paid the $85.00 shipping we could get it the next day
Later on today we received an email saying it could not be shipped because it was flammable. Nowhere on the packaging does it say it's flammable. They lied because they could not get it from the supplier on time. Being an OSHA Consultant, I know that a distributor cannot reclassify a liquid or anything else. If something is flammable you cannot reclassify it as non-flammable and vise versa. If you look at Grannicks website it clearly states it is nonflammable.
Folks, please don't take this companies word on your order, not even in writing because they won't even honor that. I hate to use the word honor, because this company has no idea what that is.< /Review>

Scam! This company should not be allowed to practice business. We never received our order- after many months of phone calls (which was a nightmare) and email correspondence and still our order was never delivered. We even contacted USPS and provided them with the two tracking numbers (yes two tracking numbers we were given for one order). USPS said they have no record of this package being processed or delivered. We forwarded this email from USPS to CA Pet Pharm’s customer service and requested a total refund. We paid for 2-3 day shipping, and after all of this months later still no word for CA pet pharmacy. They took our money and never provided the product we PAID for! Jessica the customer service rep we emailed several times should be fired. The entire company is incompetent and fraudulent. Our furry baby needed this brace post-op. It was important that we received it- but no such luck. Also, we checked their BBB rating- absolutely horrendous! Go elsewhere!!!!</Review>

I have to say California Pet Pharmacy has very competitive prices but more importantly they have GREAT customer service. When ever there was a question It was answered with in 24 hours.  I would definitely recommend them and continue to use CPP!< /review>< rating>

I have been using CPP for around 6 years now. When i call someone always answers the phone and are helpful. Great customer service , best prices on the syringes my diabetic cat needs and orders always arrive earlier than expected. I've never had any issues with them at all. 5 Stars all the way !!!<//Review>

I’ve been a customer of CPP for years ordering various medications for my rescue dogs and the last order I made was on 3/6/2020. It is an order I have placed for years for a pup that had heart disease. On Monday, 3/9/2020, my husband and I had to put this particular pup down because he got so sick almost overnight. I received my order after we returned from the vet. I called CPP that afternoon to tell them of our situation and to see if I could return the prescription and get a refund. They said due to FDA regulations, they cannot accept prescriptions once they leave their pharmacy. I had no problem with that. I understand regulatory requirements but the person on the line would not give me any options. So I asked to speak to a supervisor. Although they said they would call back within 24 hours, it was 48 hours and I had to call them. I’m still not upset at this point.

What got me upset with the company, not the supervisor was that they won’t even give me credit towards my other prescription orders that I have been getting for years for my other dogs. They said it is company policy to not provide refunds or credit. The supervisor then began to insult me by saying that if they gave a refund or credit it would essentially be taking the prescription back.

By the way, Chewy gave me full credit when I told them I was informed to not be giving me my pups a certain joint supplement. This is not a prescription but they gave me a full refund and told me to donate that product. I know it is comparing apples to oranges but the fact remains customers are not one of CPP’s priority.

Again. I’ve used CPP for years but regardless of that, they should at least work with all of their customers, first order or 100th order.

Needless to say, I will never order from CPP again and if I could give them less that 1 star I definitely would. Let’s see if they contact me regarding this review. I’ll let you know.<//Text>

I used California Pet Pharmacy for several years. My dog's medicine was $30 more per month from my Vet and I was so thankful to find them. My pup had Cushing's Disease and his medicine was expensive. I appreciate the low cost Pharmacy I found in CPP!!< /review>

<review>Never again.  They shipped by postal service with signature required.  So obviously anyone who has a job cant wait by the door to receive a package and so had to end up waiting on line at the post office or an hour.

<Text>I found CPP last year when my puppy needed a rather expensive medication, and I've been purchasing from them ever since.  Ordering is very easy,  especially since they keep my vet and refill information on file - a few clicks and my stuff arrives within a few days.  And, their prices are so much lower than what my vet charges.  I've been a customer for over a year now and have no plans to look elsewhere for my pet's medical needs.  I highly recommend them, and so does my baby :)</Text><user_name>Courtney White< /user_name><user>105808547946520915997< /user>< rating>

Terrible business practice. They insist on ME mailing my dogs prescription for a narcotic to them. Then they charge my credit card a 10$ fee when I cannot (due to the states guidelines on narcotic prescription drugs). No phone call, no explanation on there part. Here in Connecticut, the pharmacy MUST contact the Doctor or Veterinarian directly. No paper prescriptions are allowed by law.</review>

<review>I am VERY happy with the customer service, pricing, and FAST shipping in all my dealings with CPP. I have switched some prescriptions to CPP from other online pharmacies and their customer service has always been great helping me do this.  A sweet surprise when now and then they throw in a new toy with the order, at no charge.  Shipping and delivery has always been very quick on my orders.< /review>< Pics>

< review>
We are so pleased with the great service from California Pet Pharmacy. Our order was received quickly and in great shape.  There was a delay in getting the prescription from our Vet and customer service handled it for us and we got the medicine our dog needed.  Definitely will be using them from now on.  Good prices and lots of heart!<//review>

<Review>Super simple and easy to order meds at a fraction of the cost of what the vet was charging.  Pricing was also considerably lower than Chewy, PetSmart and a few other companies that I researched.  Standard shipping times are insanely quick.  With other companies, standard shipping was taking upwards of a week. With CalPet I get meds in just a few days.  Last, I've been having issues with other companies having the meds in inventory from one month to the next. Knock on wood.....this has not been an issue with CalPet.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I was a nervous to place an order for my dogs meds because of all the bad reviews but I took a chance because I could not find them anywhere else and the price was pretty good. I placed my order and paid for 2 day delivery.  When the 2 days passed i hadn't received my package.  I emailed the company to check on my order and I was quickly taken care of with a response. They let me know that someone would need to be home to sign for the package ( I couldn't do that since I work all week) They ended up sending my package back to the post office on the 3rd day which was better for me since its close to my job i was able to just pick it up. I personally had a great experience with this company. I recommend if you have any issues to reach out through email its much faster. Thanks Cali Pet Pharmacy! You guys are fast and reliable!<//Text>< Name>

I have a pet with Addison’s Disease, who requires a number of specific meds, in addition to flea and heart worm meds and California Pet Pharmacy is my go to place for everything!! I definitely recommend California Pet Pharmacy to everyone I know. It is so convenient to just order whatever meds I need for my pets and they contact my vet for approval. I have used them for years and will continue!< /text>

Horrible customer service.  I had been using them for years for expensive medication.  Right after I ordered the last refill our do dog unexpectedly passed away.  I tried to stop the order, asked if they would take it back (the box wasn't even opened).  They basically told me to pound sand.  I understand if there is a law and they legally couldn't take it back, but after being a customer for years, it wouldn't have hurt them to refund me ONCE after having just lost my dog.  I still have two dogs and I'll never order from them again their response was so rude.  It isn't worth saving $5 to get this customer service.< /Text>

CPP offers a convenient and affordable way to care for your 4-legged family members.  CPP has the prescriptions I was unable to find elsewhere and at very competitive prices.  They will contact your vet if needed for prescription approval.  Shipping is usually within 24 hours even if prescription approval is required!<//Text>

I've been using California Pet Pharmacy for the past year at least and have found them to be super speedy and reliable delivering what is ordered.  They work with my vet to receive the appropriate refills whenever needed. I don't even look elsewhere anymore as I know I am getting the best product and the lowest price.< /Text>

I ordered 21 days ago and have had to call 8 times. I still don’t have my pet’s injection and I had to take my dog back to the vet to get back on track with injections, costing me nearly $300. Every time I call, they assure me the product is shipping that day when it isn’t. I escalated the call to management to ask that they pay for expedited shipping and prevent the $300 vet visit. They “did me a favor” and credited my account $7. How insulting and what a waste of money.<//Text>

This company is a joke. Horrible customer service. “No manager available” to speak to me or to modify an order/shipping. Expect to sit on hold for a long time, no matter when you call.
Yes, the medication is cheaper than the vet, but not worth the hassle.<//review>

Every single time I place an order there is an issue. It doesn't seem to matter how far in advance I place the order, I never receive it in a reasonable time frame. Customer service has been terrible each time I have had to call, and there is never a supervisor available. Heaven help you if there is a problem with your order, because you won't find out unless you call them. Even when they do not abide by their own policies, in terms of length of time they have to prep the order, they do not make it right. I've been offered a refund on my expedited shipping costs, but how does that help if my dogs medication runs out and they refuse to overnight it, even though it is their mistake. There is no sense of responsibility or care for the animals who are affected by their negligence. I have been ordering from them for over a year and giving it chance after chance because their prices are so good, but this incident was the last straw for me. I will never order from them again. If I could give no stars I would.<//text>

<text>I would give them 0 stars for customer service and 0 stars for shipment processing.  I tried overnighting medication for my dog on a Friday.  The girl told me she would contact my vet and get back to me and she never did.  The next day, I called again and then the overnight charge was going to be almost double because of the weekend.  She said the girl from the previous day did not contact my vet, but she would.  She called me back and said she got a verbal ok to send the meds.  I was ecstatic.  On Monday, they still had not processed the order and my dog was now out of the pills she needed.  I called again and was told my vet did not give a verbal and they would have to contact them again.  By this time, I was infuriated and scared for my dog.  I was able to get her a couple days of meds for an astronomical price at a local pharmacy, but was good with them overnighting the meds on Monday to have them by Tuesday.  On Tuesday, they called me to verify my address!  They still had not sent the meds.  The girl was extremely rude when I tried to explain that they were charging me an overnight fee without actually sending the meds overnight.  Then she told me I never called back the day before to verify my address.  They had called 20 min before this conversation to verify the address.  All in all she was not sympathetic, understanding or cooperative when I asked to speak to someone else.  This place is a scam!  Never again will I use them for meds even in a pinch.</text><date>1574293827713</date></record></dataset><record>

On Monday, they still had not processed the order and my dog was now out of the pills she needed.  I called again and was told my vet did not give a verbal and they would have to contact them again.  By this time, I was infuriated and scared for my dog.  I was able to get her a couple days of meds for an astronomical price at a local pharmacy, but was good with them overnighting the meds on Monday to have them by Tuesday.  On Tuesday, they called me to verify my address!  They still had not sent the meds.  The girl was extremely rude when I tried to explain that they were charging me an overnight fee without actually sending the meds overnight.  Then she told me I never called back the day before to verify my address.  They had called 20 min before this conversation to verify the address.  All in all she was not sympathetic, understanding or cooperative when I asked to speak to someone else.  This place is a scam!  Never again will I use them for meds even in a pinch.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Best prices on the web for the medication we need.  Website is easy to use and follow-up is always thorough and on time.  Any problems we are notified.  Same good results over multiple orders!!!</Text>

<text>I have had nothing but good experiences with this company. They have great prices and their customer service has been great whenever I call. It is a bit of a wait time to get someone on the phone, but they always resolve any issues and/ or questions. I love this online pharmacy and so does my diabetic cat, Bellatrix! We get all her insulin, syringes and prescriptive food from here! Love em'!</text><Gmap_id>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7<//Gmap_id><username>Joelyne King<//username><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I just started dealing with California Pet Pharmacy this month and am very impressed with the service and prices. I especially like the fact that they'll contact your veterinarian for approval of a prescribed medication, leaving no hassle on your part.

Thank you for your prompt service.</Text>

I’ve been buying our dog’s Trifexis and Scabilor tick collars from CPP for a while now, and I’m always pleased with price and service. They call my vet to get the prescription renewed and ship the products quickly. I’d definitely recommend them to other pet owners.</text>

We've used this pet pharmacy for over a year now. It's always the least expensive, and shipping is very fast. One time a medication was out of stock, and we immediately received a phone call to discuss our options. Another time our vet hadn't yet authorized a refill, and we received prompt emails with status updates of our order.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>A total disaster. Ordered some medication for my dog a month ago (April 11), they contacted me 14 days later complaining that my vet would not respond to their fax???!!!  I suggested they could try by email...I contacted my vet too to be on the safe side. One week later inquiring about the order, they said it would ship immediately. But nothing came. That was a week ago. So I called again. This time the item--a standard medication--is on a back order!!!. It would come in next week. Sure, another 10 days since the item has not arrived to their storehouse yet. We will be easily past a month when I receive the dog medication. Just lousy.< /review>< Pictures>

I've used CPP several times, and have had wonderful customer service.  On several occasions, I'm late calling in to secure medications and they have bent over backwards to ensure that I receive the needed medications quickly.  Even going so far to call into the operations center to get my prescription out the same day.  Love these guys!  And their prices are much lower than I can get from my veterinarian.</Review>

<Text>I paid for 2-3 day shipping. When I had not received any notification after 2 business days,  I called. I was told the count on the days starts the day they ship it. What?  I paid extra for the meds to be shipped to me quicker,  but that doesn’t count the processing time. It only counts the actual days in the mail. So what did I pay for?  I asked for a refund on the shipping costs and was told no.  The meds would have gotten to me within 2-3 days anyway.</Text></record>

<gmapID>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7<//gmapID><text>Horrible customer service. My dog is on a medication for CHF, and the vet placed her on 12.5mg for one with 10 refills 3 months ago. In December I placed an order for 20mg as the vet upped the dosage. I receive a call one week later asking if the selected dosage was correct as it was different from the one on file, and the new prescription had not arrived yet. By that time my vet dropped it back down to 12.5 so I told the rep to leave it at 12.5 and use the script on file. He assured me that he would do so and that the order would arrive in 5 to 7 days. 7 days later, no package, and just another phone call asking about the dosage. When I explained that I just went through this problem 1 week ago, I now do not have the medication that I was promised to help my dogs HEART FUNCTION, and she is on her last leg, the rep said "oh well, we were waiting on your vet". Explained that one week ago, I was told that that prescription was on file (and it had NINE refills on it), the MOST they could offer me was 2-4 days shipping to fix THEIR error. When I said that wasn't acceptable, I now needed it sent overnight the response was "the order has already been sent to our shipping department". I canceled the order as my dog should not have to suffer due to their negligence as well as their complete lack of wanting to make the error right. NEVER AGAIN.</text>< Pics>

I've used this website twice because I wanted to give them a fair chance. Both times they have taken a long time to have my order shipped. If you have a normal order expect to get it in 2 or 3 weeks. Will be using someone else next time.< /Text>

Pricing is the best around, and I have check many, many places as my fur baby has a seizure disorder and has tried all the seizure medicines available.  Finally have the right dosage and two meds working (knock on wood) and CA Pet Pharmacy's pricing is the best and they ship out very quickly too!  I would highly recommend them!< /Text>

This a great company with terrific customer service.  I've used them for my horses medication for the past five years.  The prices are the best, shipping is fast and the relationship between CPP and my Veterinarian is very smooth and efficient.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None</Pics><time>1548256970683</time><text>My husband and I have used California Pet Pharmacy for a few years now and have never been dissatisfied with the prices or shipping process of this company.  In fact, we bought a year's worth of flea medication recently for our dog because it was a great deal; however, our dog unexpectedly passed away before we could use the first month of what we ordered.

When I emailed Customer Service to inquire about recommendations (because we understand that getting a refund would likely not happen due to it being a prescription), the response we got back was surprisingly cold, without any sort of acknowledgement that we have been customers for an extended period of time, that our dog just died, etc.  It's not the biggest thing in the world, but customer service, I would hope at the very least after the death of a long-term customer, would entail a smidge of humanity or compassion.

If and when we have another pet, we will not do business with CPP again, even if the prices are comparable.  I've heard incredible things about Chewy's customer service and will swiftly make the switch.</text>< username>

<review>This is my dog, Duke.  Duke has heart failure and is on Vetmedin, a powerful heart failure drug.  Vetmedin is on a national back order and California Pet Pharmacy was recommended as a place to purchase a small quantity of drug to help get us by.  They received the Rx on Monday morning. We asked for overnight shipment. The order was accepted.  Just now (Wednesday), the night before Thanksgiving, we received a call from the "pharmacy" to ask us if we were interested in being added to the "wait list".  This irresponsible company accepted the RX and waited 3 business days to let us know they were not going to fill the Rx.  We could have gone to a compounding pharmacy, but instead we believed, (incorrectly) that this pharmacy cared for pets. I would never recommend this pharmacy, somethings, money can't buy.</review><response>None</response><Date>1542848241283</Date>< GmapID>

We've managed to save some money on the meds, which is great.  And the customer service and delivery have been terrific.  We will continue to order from CPP and highly recommend them.<//Review>< time>

We have been ordering our cat's medication through California Pet Pharmacy for a number of years now. The savings are substantial verses purchasing the medications through our vets office. Ordering is a snap and the meds arrive in a timely fashion. The staff has consistently been helpful and knowledgeable. Always a positive experience.< /text>

<Review>IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU NEVER ORDER FROM CALIFORNIA PET PHARMACY. They lie about free shipping and repeatedly delay much needed prescriptions because they are unable to properly administrate orders. Here is exactly what I encountered.

On Sunday, 10/28/18 I ordered $134 of prescription cat food on their website which clearly stated, "Orders over $100 ship free." After a lengthy online ordering process, I got an email that said your order is in process. Since I had limited prescription food left for my cat, I called on Monday, 10/29/18 to check on the order. After holding for 15 minutes, the customer service representative told me, we got ahold of your vet today and your order has already shipped. I thanked her and told her I needed to make sure it shipped because I was running out of food. She confirmed it shipped.

Two days later on Wednesday, 10/31/18, I get a voicemail that says I need to call because my order was very heavy and they needed my permission to now charge me an additional  $36 before shipping. I called and waited 20 minutes for an operator and then got disconnected. I called back gain and after another 20 minute hold, I finally get a customer service representative who tells me the order did not ship and I have to approve the additional charges for it to ship. Since 4 days have now elapsed, I felt forced to accept the charges since I really needed the food. I asked why other customers got totally free shipping and I was paying a full and exorbitant rate without at least some discount. This mattered not, they would only ship if I paid it all. I gave permission and was assured it would go out the next day.

Another two days later, on Friday, 11/2/18, I get another voicemail that said Fed Ex returned my order because of "the hurricane" and I needed to call again to assure Fed Ex they could deliver to my area. At this point, I am furious. I have never dealt with more nonsense for an online order for anything. I had no hurricane in my area. I chronicle my ordeal with the customer service manager who offered nothing but, I am sorry. I suggest that some form of compensation should be offered for all of the inconvenience, which was immediately dismissed.

At this point I am so frustrated, I ask to have the order cancelled and asked for the customer service representative's name so I could write it down. I was given only "Karla" and she refused to provide a full name and said "because I don't have to." So, they have my name, address, phone and complete confidential credit card information, but this company doesn’t have the decency to provide the name of the person who is dealing with my information. Terrific. I ask for a cancellation number and was told, "We don't have those, I can send you an email."
And with that, Karla - who was the customer service "manager" - dismissed the remainder of the conversation because it did not suit her and she hung up.

Absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with, I urge you to stay away and work with a more professional organization.<//Review><rate>1<//rate>< pictures>

I have been ordering here for a few years now and this last order & their lack of customer service has left me stunned. Long story short...I ordered 3 bottles of Vetmedin (heart med) for my dog & was informed that it was on backorder from the manufacturer & they would only be shipping one bottle at a time as it became available. They asked if that was okay & how I wanted to proceed. I told them that was okay by me. They sent me my adjusted invoice (for 1 bottle) and I noticed they added on shipping. I advised them that I purposely ordered enough on my original invoice to NOT be charged shipping & that they should waive the shipping charge since it’s a product THEY are offering (this is clearly not the customer’s fault). They basically took the blame off themselves & put it on the manufacturer (even though THEY are the ones selling/shipping the product). This is not customer service. I guess they thought they were going to charge me shipping on each bottle they sent me individually as it became available. Well, I cancelled my entire order. DO NOT DEAL WITH PEOPLE THIS PETTY. ORDER FROM ANOTHER COMPANY THAT APPRECIATES YOU AS A CUSTOMER & DOES THE RIGHT THING!!!!</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

I have been ordering several medications for my rabbits from CPP and have been completely satisfied with my experience with them.  Their prices are very reasonable and there is quick and easy authorizations via my vet's office.  All orders have arrived in a timely manner with the correct medications.  I would recommend them to anyone in need of lower priced medications for their pets.< /Text>

<name>Liz<//name><Time>1486104296078</Time><rating>1< /rating><review>This co has an F rating with the BBB!  They should be Shut down!!!

I purchased what was shown on their website as a 6 month supply box of Simparica. The same box my vet sells. Their price was cheaper - so I decided to get it. When I received the product it was 1 pill in a pill bottle not the 6 month supply I ordered and was shown and is the only way this product is packaged and sold anywhere.  I called customer service and they stated all prices are per pill. It does not say that anywhere and clearly the box shown is a 6 month supply box.

They trick you by putting the mg of 1 tablet at the end of the description and put a price next to it. Which u naturally think each tablet is 20 mg and the price for the product shown is such. (Which is a 6 month supply box - the only way it is sold anywhere else).  They will not reverse the charges or do anything about their advertising scam. Showing one thing and mailing another. Thankfully my bank reversed the charge. BEWARE- DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!! I'm also reporting them to the BBB.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

STAY AWAY!!  Order your pet's medications anywhere else.  The money you might save does not make up for the aggravation and lack of help you will receive.  I was assured my order was going out on Saturday so I would have it by Monday, which took a week just to get to that point. I had to call back on Tuesday to see where my order was, it took 15 plus minutes just to speak with a live person. The rep was the slowest person I've ever spoken with and informed me that my order was shipping out today!!  A day after it was suppose to arrive!!!  Bottom-line is they don't care....do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  I'm a first time and last time customer.    HORRIBLE!</review>

California Pet Pharmacy has been a convenient and cost-effective option for ordering my dog's flea and tick medications. They contact my vet directly so I don't have to do extra work, and my orders ship quickly.< /text>

I've been ordering from CPP for at least a year now. My dog has to have steroid injections every 3-4 weeks, and their prices have already saved me a ton over buying at my local vet office. They're always courteous when I call, and shipping has always been prompt.  Highly recommended!!</text>

CPP prices and services can't be beat.  They always have the products I need and make the process of getting the Rx from my vet a breeze.  Then the medications show up on my doorstep shortly thereafter.  All from the comfort of my own home. What more can you ask for?< /text>

I had an excellent experience with this company.  They responded to my e-mails right away. They contacted my vet quickly and I got my dog's medication in time. It took a bit longer, because they had to contact my vet to make sure that there was a prescription for the meds. I will use them again and have recommended them to my friends. Also, they have different doses, so it's your responsibility and your vet's to order the right dose.</Text>

Extremely dissatisfied with this companies customer service.  When i ordered through their order system the incorrect zip-code filled in automatically.  Obviously i know my own zip code.  They changed the state and shipped it to the wrong address without checking with me.  Now they won't ship the product to me without charging me for shipping again and they won't refund my order.  Do not order from them.  They do take care of the customer.</Review>

<review>I have used CPP for years for my pets' heartworm and flea medicine and been very happy.  So when I ordered an anti-seizure medicine for my dog's brain tumor, I expected a similar experience.  Not so.  I was assured for two days that it would be shipped "today!" until I finally had someone tell me that they don't actually have that particular medicine, despite it being on their website for me to order.

So disappointed and so angry.  The last thing I want to do with a very sick dog is scramble to replace the medicine that I was assured I would have, plus have to make five phone calls to customer service over the span of four days.  If you must have the medicine, do not trust them with it.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I've been using California Pet Pharmacy for the last 3 1/2 years.  Product selection and prices are just what I needed to care for my Dobermans.  They even called me to confirm the weight of one of my dogs when I entered the wrong weight. Great personal service.  Having CPP contact my veterinarian is so easy and the order is always delivered when they say it will.
CPP has easily earned my 5 star review!<//Review>< username>

The only problem I ever had is when my vet prevented the Rx from being filled b/c I provided the wrong weight of my dog(totally my fault).  Other than that, their prices are great, and that helps when you're not making tons of money.
As far as the 1 star reviews for delays, would you wait until the last minute to order life saving medication for yourself?  Also, just go to the vet to get the refill, and give advanced time to receive your next order.  I know it's frustrating, but it's our own fault if we wait until the last minute-< /Text>

be careful dealing with this company.  I just tried to place an order for my dog's heart meds.  They sent me an email and said that they didn't have what i needed, but if i paid them anyway, they'd try and get it or waitlist me???  it's heart meds.  I don't know what kind of company charges your credit card but doesn't even have the item, but will send it if and when they get it????< /Review>

<Date>1517806029080<//Date><Rate>2<//Rate><text>Website was easy to use, the products came as described. However, the site’s shipping information is extremely misleading, so I would not recommend using this company if the medication you are ordering is time sensitive for your pet. Even if you pay extra for expedited shipping, the item will not arrive when promised (e.g. “2-4 day shipping” takes over a week to arrive). Customer support claims they disclose this lag as a “processing delay.” This is not clear on their site. When I contacted customer support about this issue, they were shockingly rude and unhelpful. There are lots of other options when filling pet scripts so I would recommend looking elsewhere.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I'm glad to have been given the opportunity to write a review for California Pet Pharmacy as I have had nothing but fantastic experiences with placing orders for my Golden Retriever. I make my purchase online for Proin and within 2-3 business days, it arrives in the mail. That is not an exaggeration. I am amazed every time.</text>

<Gmap_id>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7<//Gmap_id><Text>I purchased two bottles of a supplement for my dog for $180. When I received them and opened them they appeared rancid.  I called the drug manufacturer and talked to them about the smell. I was told they do smell but not as I described, I also had my vet smell of them, they were unsure about the smell. The Manufacturer suggested I talk to and return them where I purchased them for some more.  I called California Pet Pharmacy and was told the would not accept them back.  I told them I still wanted the supplement, I just wanted some that was safe.  They told me if the expiration date was good it was good they would not replace it.  I told them what the manufacturer said, they did not care about me or my pets health.  I talked to everyone from customer service, supervisors and managers and all had the same attitude we've got your money we're done.  Don't buy from these people, it is apparent this is their corporate attitude.< /Text><Response>None</Response><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

<Review>So my mother started using this company for her Chihuahua's meds.  The last order she placed had just been shipped, but her Chihuahua passed away in her sleep laying right next to my mom in bed.  My mother contacted the company and asked if she could refuse the package and get a full refund.  She was told no that there would be a large restocking fee.  She explained to them what happened and they showed no sympathy at all.  I have sent about three emails and never received a word back from them.  I WILL NOT use this company again nor will I suggest them to anyone.  Unsympathetic morons.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I don't normally take the time to do reviews, but I feel the need to do so in this situation because it seems like these reviews misrepresent the company. I read these reviews and I almost didn't buy from them because of it, but I decided to take the chance because they were a better price than the competitors.

I ordered three 6 month packs of heartworm medicine for my dog. I did that to get the free shipping for orders over $100. They followed up later that day with an email saying they had faxed a prescription authorization to my vet's office.

Then, a day or two later they called me and said that they had heard back from my vet, and that the vet had authorized the prescription, but had only permitted my getting two 6 months packs. I was a little frustrated with this, but my frustration was with my vet office. I don't think California Pet Pharmacy could have done anything about that.

Given the reviews and the fact that they're based on the west coast, I figured it would take a while to get here, but within a couple days I received my package. Everything was as I would have hoped. They even have a cute little cat and dog printed on their box, and they have a flyer explaining how they're available to call if I need a consultation about the prescription. All in all, they were very professional and courteous, and I would order from them again.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Horrible service! Ordered medication for my pet, paid for shipping so it could arrive in time. Package somehow got lost in the mail and this company couldn't even overnight me the medication so I could have it in time to give it to my pet. Said they had to file a claim with the shipping service and only after that was done, they would resend my order depending on the claim. I complained and asked to speak to a supervisor and of course no one was available to talk to me. After more complaining and a call back from customer service  (not a supervisor) they said the only thing they could do was have it resent to me in 3-4 days. What kind of customer service is this? I placed an order, paid for it and shipping so it can get here in time and now it got lost in the mail and this is the best they can do? If I paid for something, I expect to get what I paid for on time. Do not order from this company. They are not reliable and if your order gets lost during shipment, they will not take responsibility for it and you will have to fight to get what you ordered. Horrible customer service and horrible business. Will NEVER order from this company again!!!</text>< pics>

I placed an order and 4 days after receiving the prescription it has yet to be shipped. Trying to contact them but they don't call back after I left a message for Jessica and now trying to wait on hold so I can get my pets meds shipped express so I'll have them in time. It will take a lot for me to order from this company again.<//Text>

< review>
Two days after I place the order, they say they can't ship to me, because my billing address isn't the same as my shipping address (why have a field in the order form, then, where you can specify a billing address that isn't the same as the shipping address???). I called the number in the email, and it automatically hangs up after 1 ring (tried three times). Also, I never got a confirmation of the order. So I  now have to use process of elimination with the other, more reliable pet order sites, to figure out what all I was expecting to get from this vendor. What a headache. I'll come back and re-rate upwards a little if they successfully cancel the credit card charge, at least.< /review>

if I could give -10 stars I would.

I was told by the vet to get Revolution to deal with a rescue kittens ear mites and to use it once a month for 3 months.

He did NOT give me a prescription to buy this product.

I looked online and this company had it at a low price. I placed the order and then got an email from them telling me I needed to get the next size up because the kitten was 5.5 lbs

The kitten had other health issues and I decided to give him back rather than deal with his health issues and possible large vet bills in the future.

I then researched online and found Revolution has killed many cats and dogs after the owners used it. Long term effects on those it didn't kill are not available. I would never use this product after reading the heart breaking reviews of the owners who lost their pets.

The product arrived in a large vial and it is inside sealed packages that are to be torn off after opened and used. It could easily be resold.

After a long argument with 1st customer service then the supervisor they refused to do anything for me quoting fda policy

this is not a prescription it was not a prescription, it is available online from several other companies.

I tried to initiate a charge back but from what my  Master card it looks like I will lose because I didn't read the fine print as to this companies return policy.

I am totally upset and angry about the lost of my money to them!!!!< /Review>

Our Vet Hospital authorized a refill for a client. We faxed it twice. They claimed they never got it and then they proceeded to clutter our fax machine with the same request over and over. They also called and emailed and the client still never got the medicine. This company sucks</Text>

< Review>
The people at this company are completely incompetent. My dog has heart failure and is dependent on his medication to keep him alive. I had a prescription sent over from the vet that had a constant refill until 2017. I placed the order for my dogs meds and told the person that took my order about the continuous refill. He acted like that was no problem and everything was good to go. About three days later I discover in my junk mail a lady telling me they are waiting to get a prescription from my vet for the medications and that it was faxed over. Then they said it would be 72 hours to ship after that. What is so hard about looking up a previous order and seeing that it has a continuous refill on it? Now I'm panicking about trying to find a place that has my dogs medication on hand. It's sad to see a company with such terrible customer service and unable to do the most simple tasks. It's like they don't even care.<//Review>

< review>
California Per Pharmacy has been great and super convenient! When we adopted our puppy, our vet suggested flea and heartworm medication that was prescription only. I searched for reputable online companies with competitive prices and CPP met all of my needs. My orders came fast and the prices couldn't be beat. I've now been a customer for a year and will continue to be one.< /review>

I am shocked by the bad reviews. The prices are the best on the net, service is great, shipping takes some time but I am located in PA across the country from them, so it's logical it would take more time. Prices great, service great, great customer service agents and very pleased.</review>

<Review>I have used California Pet Pharmacy about 5 times and never had a problem. It is a little annoying that they can't save the information from previous orders into your account but that is a small inconvenience compared with how inexpensive the items are. And they ship very fast too.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>Wish I could give CPP zero stars.  Customer service is nonexistent.  They will not take responsibility for their own mistakes.  Have to wait on hold every time I call about the mistake with my order.  Every call is greeted with message about high call volume and long wait times.  Don't know why they don't hire another employee if they are that busy.  Sent 3 emails about problem and never got a single response.  Their prices are not worth the trouble.  Rx didn't arrive timely so I had to go buy it at full price at vet and now I have double what I need.  I used to recommend them to friends with pets but no longer.  I will never shop with them again.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7< /GmapID></record>

CA Pet Pharmacy doesn't take care of its customers. I recently ordered a medication where the manufacturer put them on allocation. I ordered two bottles and was supposed to receive "free shipping" CA Pet pharmacy called me and said they could ship out 1 bottle now, and another bottle in two weeks. Since I only use one bottle a month, that wasn't an issue. The issue was they REFUSED to offer the free shipping and between the two deliveries they were now charging me another $12 for shipping. They said it wasn't their fault and they would not honor the free shipping. Honestly, they should have just handled it and not put the burden and blame back on their customers for an issue between them and their MFG. This makes me think that if there were ever a larger issue, they wouldn't support a loyal customer. LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR YOUR PET MEDS.<//review>

The good.
California pet pharmacy has great prices on pet health items.

The bad
California rarely is timely about anything. and there ordering sucks because you have to overnight insulin but there site doesn't state that or give an option for the correct shipping.

The UGLY
called me after 4 days of my order after 3 calls from me to make sure they had the prescription and the funding for the overnight shipping and told me they could only fill 2 of my 6  insulin (resulting in triple the charges for shipping) I told the girl this wasn't acceptable as they were 4 days late getting me the product anyway.

I'd avoid this company unless your really broke and need to save the 5 or six dollars you'll save from other pet med sites< /review>

I have waited 3 weeks for my delivery that I was told would arrive in 5 to 7 business days and I still haven't received it.  When I try to call and check on my order they are alway experiencing high call volume,  I held for 15 minutes and gave up.  I will not order from California Pet Pharmacy again.<//Review>

Order placed on 4/25, I was sent an email telling me they were waiting on the vet. I called on 5/3 for them to tell me they had to change my order so I would have to pay shipping. They CLAIM they called and left me a message. The number I use is my business and NO call was made, THEN they said that they emailed me and NO email either. They were very RUDE! I own a business and have won Best of City EVERY year I have been open because I treat my customers RIGHT!!! I will be changing pharmacies because of the way I was treated!!!!!</Review>

<Date>1417204548251</Date><rating>1</rating><review>Their lower prices encouraged me to try them in the first place but I was completely disappointed with their lack of responsibility and poor customer service. I will never again do any kind of business will them and do not recommend them to anyone, based on my sad previous experience with them.

I bought my dog's heart worm prevention pill from California Pet Pharmacy but did not hear back from them about the shipment of my order for several days. I had to call them a few times in order to make them follow up with my vet to get the prescription verification and ship the product. When they finally did these steps, I was told that I will receive the product in a few days.

However, a few days later, I was told that the date on their current pills will be expired before I have enough time to use them. They told me that they will receive a new batch of pills next week and can send me then. I agreed but did not hear back from them for the next 2 weeks after that. I had to call them again and a rude customer service told me that they only have the previous batch of pills with the expiration date earlier than the time I can consume them all. I asked them to adjust the number of pills based on the expiration date in a way that I will have enough time to consume them all. To my surprise, they added extra shipping/handling cost to my invoice in order to send me the pills. At this time, my dog was a month late on his pills and I only wanted to get hand on the pills. So, I agreed to get the pills and pay for the additional shipping/handling cost.

Based on my experience, they have rude customer service, poor follow up on your order, and lack of responsibility that creates a horrible experience. I will never ever buy any product from them and do not recommend them at all.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I do not recommend them. I have had a problem filling a prescription for my sick dog that needed heart medicine ASAP -- I paid priority but got nothing on the mail and not even a call from them. They said they never heard from my vet and when I called my vet they had timely filled two other prescriptions with Wegmans but never received an e-mail, fax or call from them California Pet Pharmacy. I believe my vet --- especially after looking all all the other reviews. Wish I saw those reviews before.
Even if they never heard from my vet they should have contacted me or the vet. They never did.
They are not reliable -- they are irresponsible.<//review>

Beware: Disingenuous business practices. Would rate zero if I could.

On three purchases, regarding the expected 24 to 72 hour delivery, the first exceeded this and took a week; the second ordered on Monday, received on Wednesday; the third was out of stock and they never called to let me know. I found out only when I called after the 72 hours had been exceeded.

The MANAGER did not know when it would be back in stock. She offered me a 30% discount if I left the order open. Based on this, I decided that I'd purchase an immediate refill at my local vet and leave this one open for future use. When it finally came, I discovered they only credited me 3% and the MANAGER insisted that was all she had promised me.

3% is 1.24 -- that's such an insignificant amount. If she TRULY had said 3%, I would have laughed, said thanks for showing me how much you value your customers, and said "CANCEL MY ORDER".

So, not only do they have horrible business practices about not following up on orders when items are out of stock, they don't stand behind their promises to customers.

NEVER AGAIN.<//text>

<Text>Every single time I place an order there is an issue! They were even sending my prescription refill to a vets office I have never even heard of! I have called on numerous different occasions to get this random business off my acct and I can't. They also had the wrong phone number and my maiden on the account. Even though I have changed it numerous times with them, twice this month in fact. Customer service has been terrible each time I have had to call, and there is never a supervisor available. Supervisors also get to take 24 hours to call you back!!! I have spent one month trying to get this prescription corrected to no avail. If there is a problem with your order, you won't find out unless you call them. Even when they do not abide by their own policies, they do not make it right. There is no sense of responsibility or care for the animals who are affected by their negligence. I have been ordering from them for over 2 years and gave them several chances but this incident was the last straw for me. I will never order from them again. If I could give no stars I would.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7< /GmapID></record>

Well, today I lost my lionfish because of a minor bacterial infection that could've been easily treated with metronidazole I ordered from this place on 8/31. If only they had actually informed their customers that the items they were being charged for and waited a week to get in the mail WEREN'T EVEN IN STOCK AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. To think I could've bought the medication on Chewy like I had intended to before going bargain hunting to these irresponsible people, and my lionfish would've been fine. I lost more than $60 I paid for the antibiotics, I lost a beloved pet, so I hope this review helps someone avoid the same heartbreak .< /text>

I have used Calif Pet Med for the past 2 years. Saved hundred of dollars. The only problem, which is not their fault, is they don't except fax or pdf Rx that my vet issue to me to be email or fax to them. They need the original to be sent by snail mail.
They calculated the wrong amount for my dogs and over charged me. When  I emailed them of their mistake. They promptly refunded me the overcharged amount.
The meds were priority mail to me quickly. I will return to this place next year.<//text>

I ordered from this company a few weeks ago and their online web service wouldn't allow me to create an account so I could save my info.  This was annoying but not a deal breaker.  I received a call a couple weeks later indicating that my shipment had been returned to them and they would need to charge me again to resend.  I assumed that I'd messed up the street address by bad typing and called this morning to straighten things out.  The rep I spoke to told me they had an entirely different address for my order (for the local car dealer where I've never shopped!) something that I would never have typed in. They can't tell me where they got the address and told me that them system couldn't have messed up in this way and it must have been something I did - essentially calling me a liar.   Since they can't return meds (FDA rule) I had to pay for the shipping again or just throw them away.  Bad decision to permanently lose yourself a customer for the cost of $5.75< /Review>< Pics>

Prices are amazing, however they drop the ball when it comes to approving and processing order. Even if you call everyday (and average wait time is 30 mins), they will lie and say everything is set. Usually from start to finish your item arrives in 3 weeks, if you pay extra you are looking at 2 weeks, and for $35 extra you are looking at 1 week. There are so many other options with similar prices this just isn't worth it.<//review>

< Review>
Ordered for my Shih Tzu the Latanaprost eye drops. The shipping was fast and the cost of the eye drops was way low than a local pharmacy that filled the eye drops when my dog 1st started on them. The cost was $29 less with California Pet Pharmacy. This is a medication that my dog has to use for the duration of her life for Glaucoma. If i had not did my research and found California Pet Pharmacy i don't know how i would be able to afford this medication for my dog as she has to get the drops three times a day. Thanks California Pet Pharmacy for having such affordable prices.</Review>

I ordered a heart medication critical to my dog's health. California Pet Pharmacy charged my card and let me know they would ship the medication. A few days later I contacted them because I hadn't gotten a shipment notification and they replied by email letting me know the medication was out of stock and they could not give me any further information. Had I not inquired about the ship date I would not have know the medication was unavailable, and something this time sensitive should have been handled by phone. My dog will die without this medication, and someone working in the pharmaceutical field should know how vital it is that prescription orders from a doctor be followed. No one apologized and I had to fight them to even refund my money. Please do not reply on California Pet Pharmacy to have your sick pet's best interest at heart.<//Text>

Like many of us pet owners who cant afford the high prices of pet meds, I got lured in by the lower price. Within a short while on the medication I ordered, my pet got much worse.  I finally went and got the same med from my vet, and my pet got better immediately. In other words, the med that was supposed to be in the pills this company sold me  wasn't in it.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.</text>

<text>Seemed too good to be true,  the meds were less than half of what my vet was asking, and all I had to do was call and the lady I spoke with took all my info down and 5 days later my dogs meds came right when they said they would come.  Great company!< /text>< username>

The only problem, which is not their fault, is they don't except fax or pdf Rx that my vet issue to me to be email or fax to them. They need the original to be sent by snail mail.
They calculated the wrong amount for my dogs and over charged me. When  I emailed them of their mistake. They promptly refunded me the overcharged amount.
The meds were priority mail to me quickly. I will return to this place next year.< /text>< pictures>

CPP is extremely affordable, has a huge selection of medications and very fast delivery. Every time I have had to contact customer service, due to my vet's office's machine not receiving their refill fax, CPP has been very courteous and helpful. I would, and have, recommended them to friends of mine and I will continue to order from them. The only "negative" thing I have to say about the company is, I wish they would get the Customer Account option, to their website, up and running.<//review>

<Text>My veterinarian's office has an online pharmacy, which I had to use to order a new prescription for my cat that local human pharmacies did not carry. I was shocked by the cost and the FEES, so many fees. When I compared the cost to CPP, it was over half of my vet's online site. I've been ordering other prescriptions from CPP for a few years and I've never had any problems and the prices are great. I've already requested that my vet send refills for the new prescription to CPP.< /Text>< Pictures>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Absolutely DO NOT use this company... they're incompetent! My vet rec'd them (I've since let them know not to use them in the future) and it's been a nightmare since day one. Long hold times, incompetent customer service reps, poorly designed web site and long shipping times... I'm not sure how they stay in business.

I called in a refill and it took 8 min to speak to someone. Guess they're not concerned bout getting new business. It took them SEVEN days to contact my vet for authorization. They shipped it to the wrong address. I called again to change my address- waited FIFTEEN minutes this time. The girl over the phone repeated the new address to me twice but when the confirmation email came she left off part of the street and the apartment number. How could she repeat the correct address to me then enter it incorrectly into the system... incompetent!

OH, did I mention that my poor dog has been w/o her meds for over ten days now? Not only does CA Pet Pharm not care about customer service, they also don't care about the health of my pet.

DID YOU KNOW... you can have your pet RX filled at your regular pharmacy? I'm not sure if they can fill everything but they could fill mine. Call your pharmacy or some other pet pharmacy company... avoid these jokers at all costs.</Review>< Pictures>

CPP is the best pet pharmacy that I have ordered prescriptions from in the last several years. They provide excellent customer service and a wide range of quality medications. CPP makes is easy to order and refill prescriptions online which saves time. They offer good prices compared to most pet pharmacies as well!<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>I started using California Pet Pharmacy about 6 months ago. From the beginning, where we had to send the prescription in, make sure that everything was in order, CPP has been helpful and prompt in getting our dog Roger's prescription to us. I can place an order in the morning, and have received notification the same day that it has shipped! I save lots of $$$ ordering through them and have always received prompt customer service ,even when leaving a voicemail. Thank you CPP!</Review></record>

<Text>Great prices and always great customer service.  If you didn't experience this, it was a fluke and you should try them again.  I always order ahead of when I need my pets' meds because you can't anticipate problems.  Buyers can be proactive, too, if their vets aren't timely responding and check wth them.  Seems to me you should be complaining about your vet more than this company.<//Text></record>

This is an excellent place to purchase your pet meds no matter where you live in the US.  The process is easy and prices are much more reasonable than any other place I have found.< /text>

< Review>
I have relied on California Pet Pharmacy (CPP) for several years to ensure our two dogs’ total health. While I had previously tried a few different online pharmacies, I have always found CPP to be THE best source, in terms of quality, ease of ordering & delivery & affordability. I get both dogs’ Heartgard Plus & Comfortis from them, as well as Vetmedin & Enalapril for our one dog who has a heart issue. I have found CPP to provide extremely efficient & timely service. Now that they have added online account features, i.e., you create your account, which includes your pets’ names, medical conditions & medications needed, along with veterinarian’s information, it is an easy, seamless process to order & receive needed medications. I recommend CPP wholeheartedly!</Review>

Ordered 2 products online and opted for expedited shipping in order to make sure I would have the meds for my dog before we ran out. After a couple of days, I called to see why I had not received a shipping confirmation. I was told that one of the products was not available in the size/Qty I ordered even though it showed in stock on the web site at the time of my order. I was told the order was held up due to this. I asked them why they didn't go ahead and ship the Rimadyl which they did have in stock and was the primary purpose of our order. I was told that this just wasn't their policy. I then reminded the customer service rep that I paid for expedited shipping and would expect that they would split the shipment and send what they had in stock like most online retailers do. I was then told that in addition to the suggested shipping time of 2 to 4 days there was also a processing time of a couple of days and if I had read the fine print I would know this.

The Rep seemed incredulous that I would expect to actually receive the product in the 2 to 4 day window suggested with the expedited shipping and that I had somehow missed the fact that they also have an order processing allowance that would need to be added on top of the shipping time. I must be a moron for assuming that paying for expedited shipping of between 2 to 4 days meant that I would receive the product in 2 to 4 days.

I asked to speak with a manager and was denied. I then suggested that if I were in their shoes, I would overnight the product since this order hadn't gone smoothly and would make some changes to their website so that the suggested shipping time would include processing. Furthermore, I suggested they may want to make sure if the website shows a product in stock, that it really is in stock.  The Rep again cited policy and that they would not be willing to overnight the product. Basically I was being told this was how they do business, they aren't interested in improving and I would just have to deal with it.

Not what I would expect from a professional business in this day and age. California Pet Pharmacy would be wise to invest in some customer service training so their reps can become more professional and better equipped to handle customer service issues effectively instead of making the customer feel like they are the enemy. Will be looking for a new supplier!<//text>

<Text>I placed my order today for Vetmedin 10mg and I got a call from California Pet Pharmacy l , they let me know that they did not have that medication in stock since the manufacture is allocating it. I really needed this for my dog ! they informed me about other strengths like the Vetmedin 5mg and called my vet right away and got the prescription approved.  If the representative didn't tell me about the other strengths we would have not got anything at all. Thank you so much!!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Our Great Dane is on Vetmedin, which is often times hard to find.  Ordering thru CPP has been an easy process.  I usually have receipt within 3 days or so of placing the order.  Reordering online is a breeze! Their price is very competitive and shipping is nominal.  I HIGHLY recommend them!<//Review>

I have ordered before with no issues and when I contacted them to reorder. I did find one of the items at a better price elsewhere so I asked if they matched prices. The guy wasn't sure so he checked for me and then said they did, he checked the other online price and the guy placed my order accordingly. A while later they called me to tell me that it ends up that they couldn't match the price and he was told incorrectly. I called to discuss with a manager and I was told they were too busy to talk with me and the lady I was speaking to couldn't help me. Wasted a bunch of time and ended up cancelling my order due to this. It was only a $10 savings and I feel bad for the guy that had to call me back to tell me he was told wrong. I will no longer will use this company, sad over $10.<//Review>

<text>Terrible customer service! Spent over 36 minutes on the phone, finally get a manager with a condescending attitude - absolutely not helpful! My order was back-ordered and I was NOT informed. They weren't supposed to charge my credit card until the order was filled, but instead they charged me and didn't fill the order until over a week later! Now I'm left scrambling to find an alternative for my dog until their package arrives (in 2-4 business days) because Vanessa refused to send even part of my order overnight.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

Terrible communication! I placed an order. They called my vet and confirmed the order. I called them back to make sure everything was OK.  Yes, they said, we will ship your order.  ONE WEEK LATER, no order.  I called them.  Where's my stuff?  Oh, they said, it's on backorder. We should have it in a few days and then we will mail it to you. Really?<//text>

Terrible customer service. Terrible website. They are 15 miles from my home but can't seem to ship an order in less than 2 weeks. They are full of excuses (can't reach your vet, item back ordered, etc.), but never communicate with you to solve the issue. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices. Your pet will be sick waiting for meds while this place screws up your order.</review>

The worst company, customer service sucks!! My medipaw boot fell apart after 10 days asked for a replacement they will not replace or refund and the "supervisor" kept saying the same thing over and over and then hung up on me. Not to mention she called from a cell phone, which I'm pretty sure she isn't suppose to do.<//Review>

I placed an order for CET chews. A couple of days later, I received an email from them stating that there would be a $10 upcharge for shipping on my order.

I regard this as unethical and dishonest. Nowhere on the product page is it advertised that there will be additional shipping charges. I paid shipping on checkout, and if the shipping charge there is not correct, then they should correct it. They quote one price and after you check out try to charge another (in this case, a 25% hike).

This is just a bait and switch technique. Bad practice. I won't do business with them again. You shouldn't either.

BTW, Google is nuts. The average rating is 2.4, not 3.3.< /text>

I have always had great service and great prices from CPP for the last 5 years. I live in Texas and understand that any medications ordered from CPP will take several days to arrive. Their customer service has always been friendly and it is easy to place an order.

CPP has saved me a lot of money over the years!</review>

I use California Pet Pharmacy for both of my kitties. Cleo takes thyroid medicine 2x/Day & I can order #100 tabs (Methimazole) at a time and save a ton of money!  Gizmo occasionally need subcutaneous fluids for her constipation and CPP has the best price on this too!  I've been a customer for a few years.  They are courteous, efficient and meds are shipped promptly!

this company is a rip off.  I tried to order Tri-Heart Plus from this company and they require a prescription from the vet. This medication does NOT require a prescription. I ordered this over 10 days ago and no notification from this company of why we have not received this order. Just go to your vet or Pet Smart or any pet supply company and get your heartworm meds from them.  This company is rediculous.  I waited 10 plus days for this to be delivered just to find out I need a prescription from my vet that is NOT required.  Run do not walk from this company.  Support your local vet and let this company go under.  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY.  WHAT A RIP OFF.<//Review>

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE STORE!!!  I paid for overnight shipping of $49 but the items came a week later.  When I called they said they weren't able to process it in time so that caused the delay.  DUH!  I called multiple times, waited to talk to the 'supervisor', left messages to get a call back from the supervisor since EVERY idiot customer service people said they couldn't give me a refund, only a supervisor could but you never get to the supervisor!!  After a week of calling at least 2-3 a day, NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Fine, they win!  If I could give less than 1 star, I would, but that's the only way I could post something here.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Ordered for my pet flea and tick meds. After over a week I called and asked where the meds were. They said they had a problem with the credit card. My CC company says no problems. I call them back an let them know the urgency for the meds and to re-run the card while I am on the phone. The card went through, they apologized and said they would ship rush shipping and not charge me.

I have been working and mistakenly presumed they did what they promised.

They didn't.

I figured out 3 weeks later that they still hadn't shipped because my dog now has fleas and a tick.

I now have to take my dog to a vet to make sure he is ok.

I emailed this morning and called CPP now and asked what happened, and they said they shipped out the package today. Not rush shipping either, just standard.

I asked why this happened and asked to speak with a manager. The person came back 3 times with responses from a manager, but they would not let me talk to them.

Take a look at the 83 1 star responses that this company has. I wish I would have.

Do not use California Pet Pharmacy if you want your medications for your fur babies. And post your responses everywhere you can on consumer sites to spread the word.

Oh and I forgot to add.... after talking 3 times with the person, he told me the manager says the original package was shipped and must not have reached me. Convenient.... AND.... I don't believe it because they always send an email automatically when the products ship, along with a tracking number. Guess what... no email with tracking number. When I asked for the original tracking number.... crickets.< /Text>< pictures>

Customer service was some of the worst I have ever experienced in my life time. I  could not afford my dog's syringes so I had to wait until I got paid. The day I ordered them I had 14 days before I ran out of syringes. I thought it was reasonable to expect I would get them in a timely manner.

First there was the delay because California requires a perscription from your vet to sell you the syringes.

Then there was the promise from their customer service rep that she would request that my order be shipped immediately upon receipt of the perscription from my vet. I discussed with her whether I should upgrade my shipping to priority shipping. I was reassured by her that ground would get my syringes to me in time. Five days later I had not received an email confirming a shipment of my order so I called them.

Man was I livid when I found out the syringes had not been shipped yet. I was so stressed. I knew of no place locally where I could get the syringes. I demanded that they ship them immediately and do it overnight service with them paying for the faster shipping. The customer service manager refused to ship it over night saying she would not be taken advantage of. The woman agreed to send it three day shipping service.

Well I ran out and had to pay $1 a syringe from a vet hospital to tie me over.

Left them immediately and found Total Diabetes Supply out of Florida. Amazing company. Fast shipping!!!!</review>

I have been a customer of CPP for over 4 years, their service has always been outstanding, quick delivery and has saved me over 80% on medication when compared if I purchased locally. I would highly recommend CPP to all.< /text>

<Date>1522155259414</Date><rating>1</rating><review>Horrible and dangerous customer service.  We have been using this company for several years without issue until recently.  Our dog is on a medication to prevent *heart failure,* and CPP did not bother to notify us that there was a delay in getting refill authorization.  When the rx failed to arrive in the mail (and we realized we had never gotten shipping notification), we called CPP and were informed that they tried *one* time to get the refill, had no success, and never 1) followed up with us to notify us there was an issue, or 2) tried to call our vet's office a second time.  When I called to ask where the prescription was, only then was I informed there had been issues.

Alarmed with the news (and down to one pill), I specifically asked that they call the vet's office (as did I, immediately) for refill authorization, overnight the rx, and call me immediately if there were any delays.

Today, no evidence of shipped medication, no phone call indicating there were issues, and I have just been informed that CPP still has not been able to reach the vet/process the order (which has been faxed twice now by the vet per their records when I called again this morning).  Our dog is now out of medication, and I will need to drive 45 minutes to her cardiologist to get her through the weekend.

Our animals are our children, our family, and CPP clearly does not value their health or wellness if this is how they do business.  Avoid this company unless you have the time and energy to track every order like a hawk to make sure your pets don't slip through the cracks.

Addendum: CPP called Friday and said they would pick up the "overnight" shipping costs.  The medication did not arrive until Monday.  Thank goodness I was skeptical and still made the trip to her vet Friday (1.5 hours later) to get the medication, or our dog would be struggling to breathe right now.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
this company is a rip off.  I tried to order Tri-Heart Plus from this company and they require a prescription from the vet. This medication does NOT require a prescription. I ordered this over 10 days ago and no notification from this company of why we have not received this order. Just go to your vet or Pet Smart or any pet supply company and get your heartworm meds from them.  This company is rediculous.  I waited 10 plus days for this to be delivered just to find out I need a prescription from my vet that is NOT required.  Run do not walk from this company.  Support your local vet and let this company go under.  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY.  WHAT A RIP OFF.</Review>

When I found out my dog needed medication for her heart murmur I was upset. I was even more upset to see how much the medication was. After countless research I found California Pet Pharmacy consistently had the lowest price, and free shipping for my order since I was spending $100. Perhaps happy customers don't bother to write reviews and those who are very unhappy go out of their way to make it known. Who knows? I am actually in the process of placing my third order (within the last 6 months) and I couldn't be more happy with the price, service and promptness of my order. I would recommend using this pharmacy!<//Review>< resp>

<text>Having used this company in the past, I summit a Oder for our pet needing a script.

Found out later that vet rejected it via fax because that had not seen our pet in awhile. We never got a email or any communication from California pet and I had to call the vet to find this out.

Meanwhile We had moved from the area so I thought it was a good time to change vet.

We never got anything from California that they got the fax and it was processing and had to call them to find this out.

After two day called them again to find out the order was being processed and would be sent out this morning

All this going on when I ordered from the beginning that time was a factor as my pet was out of meds

Their phones are always experiencing a higher call volume no matter when you call.

Seem like I had to babysit them through the whole process just to know if it was really coming.

Good prices but not impressed with this company.<//text>< Pictures>

I placed an order for CET chews. A couple of days later, I received an email from them stating that there would be a $10 upcharge for shipping on my order.

I regard this as unethical and dishonest. Nowhere on the product page is it advertised that there will be additional shipping charges. I paid shipping on checkout, and if the shipping charge there is not correct, then they should correct it. They quote one price and after you check out try to charge another (in this case, a 25% hike).

This is just a bait and switch technique. Bad practice. I won't do business with them again. You shouldn't either.

BTW, Google is nuts. The average rating is 2.4, not 3.3.<//review>

I started using CPP early 2017 for my dogs arthritis. I pay almost half the price my vet charges. There deliveries and customer service is 5 stars. Keep up the great work.

UPDATE:
I have been purchasing medication from CPP for well over 3 years. As a senior citizen I need all the discounts I can get. CPP is much lower in price than my vet. Their customer service is extremely helpful and their shipping is fast. I highly recommend CPP for all your fur babies needs. Give them a try ask for a quote, you will be glad you did.</text>

Gizmo occasionally need subcutaneous fluids for her constipation and CPP has the best price on this too!  I've been a customer for a few years.  They are courteous, efficient and meds are shipped promptly!

<review>Horrible. They’ve dropped the ball twice where I’ve placed an order for seizure meds for my pet and never received the meds or heard back for more than a week. Leaving my pet wo meds and me scrambling to the vet’s office. Their first excuse was my vet never received their fax. Why didn’t they double check the day it was faxed and follow up? I had to call only to be told they don’t know what happened. Second time was the same excuse but my vet said they DID receive the fax but to let me know patient needed an annual exam to renew the med and dosage. California Pet Pharmacy never relayed the message. Nothing.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I have 2 dogs in which they received a 12 month prescription for heart worm meds in Sept 2017. I order 12 months at a time, obviously 6 months per dog (same weight). I receive 12 doses in September, very smooth.
I reorder the 2nd 12 doses last week. I was informed that it was denied by my vet. I was at my vet when we called this company and the mix up was the first 12 doses was under one dog and they were requesting 12 more for the same dog. Verbally on the phone it was straighten out and approved for the other dog, the c/s rep said no problem, all straight now. The next day I get call stating they got approval for one dog but not the other, I laugh and say ok, no problem send the 12. All ok.
Next day I get another call, the meds I’m receiving are expired but the mfg is sending an extension letter and standing behind it, I say ok.
Now today, I receive a call that I was only approved from my vet for 6 months. I spoke with the vet, they approved 6 months per dog. Last time I was in school 6x2 = 12.
I have cancelled all my business with these people. I think a 5th grader could do a better job communicating, just not worth it, especially for expired meds.<//Text>

After my vet called a prescription , I did not receive a cal so I called them 2 days later. I asked when it would be shipped .  She said in 48 to 72 hours and another 4-7  business days  before delivery.  Now I will buy a bottle from somewhere else since I will be out in 5 days.  I usually receive my drug orders in 3-4 days.</Review>

On google it says Revolution for Cats shows a box of 6 doses for $43.99 and even says 6 doses are $43.99 + $5.50 shipping while everyone else is selling the 6 doses for $85+.  When you click on to their website it shows that the 3 dose box is $43.99 and the 6 pack is $84.99.  This is false advertising!  I will never shop here because of this deception!

The bad reviews about CPF are very true. They are very unorganized and cannot even keep track of refills for your pets medications. Definitely would recommend you look elsewhere and save yourself a lot of aggravation and frustration.

I have tried 4 times today alone ordering meds from these guys and spent over an hour on the phone with them. I urge you to pass this company by. They have by far the worst customer service of any company I have ever had to deal with.</Text>

Had a scary trip to the vet, and found my dog needed some costly meds. My vet recommended I shop online and I came across this place. I was skeptical, but went thru with it. That was over 2 years ago and I have been very happy with CPP! I have never had an issue with fulfillment or shipping. I recommend them to anyone I come across!<//Review>

I had a horrible experience with this company. After receiving one order from them correctly I found they had mislabeled my package and it was tied up for a MONTH with USPS. It was eventually returned to the sender and they then wanted to recharge me for shipping to get it to me. I asked for a refund and they refused. Terrible customer service experience, I will not be purchasing from them again, do not be fooled by  a couple good orders, any problem and they are miserable to work with.</Review>

<Review>After bad experiences with multiple online pet pharmacies, California Pet Pharmacy was a blessing for our family. We were spending about $400 a month for our dogs meds. Then I paid a hundred less here at California Pet Pharmacy BUT for over 2 MONTHS WORTH!! Plus I ordered a bunch of pill pockets. They were on time, friendly and super fast. They didn't notify me when it shipped, but when I called to ask if they had she emailed me the tracking number right away, the meds arrived in less then a week from when I ordered. They were the same brand/packaging.size and shape as what our vet gave us. We will be ordering through this company from now on!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I tried to use California Pet Pharmacy to order insulin syringes for my cat.
I placed the order, chose priority shipping for $6.95, and send them my prescription.
After a few days, I received a phone call informing me that they have received my prescription and that they have to charge me an additional shipping fee for the quantity I ordered.
I asked how high the fee will be and the customer service representative told me around $15.00.
I made it clear to her that I consider this unacceptable because the order was placed with the high quantity and I chose their service because they were the most affordable including product and  shipping costs.

I consider this extremely misleading and am very displeased with the lack of transparency and professional service from California Pet Pharmacy. I consider it highly questionable to hook customers on apparently low shipping expenses and then confront them afterwards with an additional fee.
California Pet Pharmacy caused a high level of inconvenience for me and I will not consider choosing their services again.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<response>None<//response><text>Terrible customer service! They took 6 days to contact my vet for my order and then never sent it to me or contacted me again. I called multiple times but it took over 8 mins on hold to finally get through to a person. This person was snarky and told me they had been trying to contact me because their supply was out of date and they could not fulfill my order properly.They had not contacted me or tried very hard in the 16 days since my order had been placed. I had no messages and they sent no emails after the first order confirmations. They did charge my credit card for the order that they never shipped however so I thought that it was on it's way. NOPE. Part of the order was heart medication that my dog has not had for over a week now. said they can send it now- that is great my dog might not live long enough to get it.
Placed an order with petrx2go once and it shipped super fast and had no problems with them! They had to contact me because I had a typo in my order and they got it fixed fast and called right away- I should have used them again.</text><username>Mel G< /username>< date>

<text>I wish I could give zero stars.

I will not buy from this company!  They would not ship to my 2nd home...even after they require CVV for checkout on their website (not in any FAQ).   But it accepted the order....I only found out after an "I wonder what happened" question from my wife.....

Their CSRs seemed nice, but did not address the basic issue & they did not acknowledge  removing me from their system.....I am alerting my Credit Card company to fraud that may originate due to this cancelled transaction

All these things indicate a company in trouble...

Good luck< /text>< Time>

<text>i ordered 2 prescriptions for my ailing 13 year old Labrador and was told it would take 3- 5 days to receive. 14 days later i still haven't received it. when I called to ask what happened they told me that they don't keep big inventories and by the time the shipping room got to my order they had run out of both medications and had to put me on back order, thus delaying my dog receiving the needed drugs. I have since run out of the drugs and have to go the the vet and pay very high prices to fill in the gap until the shipment arrives in another 3 days! When I asked to have another batch sent over night they said they would charge me $25 for shipping even though they admit to their poor service in the first place.
There are many other online pet pharmacies- no need to give this company your business when it clearly is not a service oriented seller.</text><name>Eli Katz</name><user_id>117680651300073293457< /user_id><Date>1398294050519</Date>< gmapID>

<date>1442289016540</date><Text>Please do not use this Pharmacy. Customer service is absolutely horrible.  When they say free shipping it does not come with any guarantee.  If USPS loses the package it is not insured so there  you do not get the product and you no refund.     So the free shipping is a joke.  By the way 1800 pet meds is a better pharmacy they guarantee your order and they match CPP's prices. In addition they don't work with you at all.  The only option they gave me was to reorder and they would waive priority shipping.  What a joke when you spend over $100.00.  I even asked if they would send me a few pills so that my dog would not experience withdrawals symptoms from not having her  anti-anxiety medication and they said it was against their policy but of course they are willing to place another order. I spoke with Millie(supervisor) and she said USPS always makes mistakes.  So why does this company use USPS and if they are going to use USPS they should insure the shipment.  I was very upset because I sensed from their comments they were not going to provide good customer service.  PLEASE DONT USE THIS PHARMACY< /Text><userid>114341983098395729874< /userid>< username>

Read alot of bad reviews about long waits for out of stock product will little to no customer service responses. I emailed customer service to verify the item was in stock, theynquickly replied, I then mailed my prescription after making the order, and once they got my prescription (day of) they charged my card and I received my order 1 day earlier than USPS estimated. I will order again as the price was less than 1/3 what my vet charged and also one of the least expensive across the internet. Note. Their email server went to my SPAM junk mail so be aware if you get no receipt after you order or customer service is not received... check you junk mail.</Text>

They were very friendly and helpful I just hope that Fairmont animal hospital will validate the script they wrote for my bella they charged 137$ for one week I need 2 more weeks with them cost is 250$ ,with this company only 110$. If my vet don't work with California pet my dog may have to go without a week of meds and pix back up and hopefully it works. My dog is very sick if this sets things back and she eds up not ok I will forever be pissed with my vets. Frustrated in NY<//Text>

Pet Pharmacy for about four years now. I have to say, always a good
Result. They call me if there is a problem and work to get the meds back
to us quickly. I appreciate their service.<//text>

I could only order the meds when I had enough money and sometimes that meant my boy may have to go without for a few days but CPP cared about our situation and more than once they filled and shipped our order same day so we wouldn't have to go without. I will always be thankful for that.</text><Name>Donna Dillon<//Name>< gmapID>

Been ordering Vetoryl from CPP for 2 years to treat Cushings Disease. My vet charges $86.90 vs CPP price of $52.95. Oh and she has to get tested to verify medicine levels so it is legitimate real, not expired, sealed packages. They handle all the dealing with refills for you and shipping is very fast. The one time I had to call they were very helpful and an actual person emailed me to follow up. Would recommend to any pet owner!!< /Text>

<review>Worst customer service I have ever experienced. They sent the medication to the wrong address and blamed it on me that I  had provided the wrong information. I provided them a screen shot of the confirmation where it showed I typed in the right address and they still charged me again to reship the medication to another address. The customer service rep and the "manager" that I spoke too (sounded like the same person to me) was completely unhelpful to rectify this situation and extremely rude on the phone. I asked to speak to someone above her and said there was no one else. Basically called me a liar though I emailed them proof. Worst Ever!<//review><Gmap_id>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7< /Gmap_id><response>None</response>< pics>

Cheap prices got me in, lack of fulfillment and broken promises on order #1 will keep me from returning.

Order placed Nov 5, vet confirmed two days later.  Received a call yesterday (Nov 12) stating the firm needed my vet's name, which was on the original order. I have ordered these online for the last 5 years and get them within a couple days from every company I've tried, with the exception of California Pet Pharmacy.

After speaking to a representative yesterday, I told her that my dog was in pain without her meds, and her mobility should not be made to suffer due to the complacency of the company.  I was assured the meds would be sent out overnight by the representative.

Receiving an email this am (Nov 13) stating my order went out today and I would receive the product in 3-6 days.  I detest being lied to.

I will gladly pay a bit more to have an ounce of service.</Text>

< Review>
I've been using CPP for a year. Recently, I ordered a 6 month supply of Interceptor (heartworm medication) for my dog. After receiving the shipment I checked the box and CPP had sent me a supply that would expire in 4 months.  They wouldn't replace my 2 tablets that would be less or ineffective, or refund my money.  It took numerous emails to get a full credit.  I don't know how a company could send a customer, soon-to-be expired medication. And how does a company not replace the meds that are expired?  Poor customer service.   I won't be using CPP in the future.< /Review>

We've been using California Pet Pharmacy for years.  Great prices & fast service.  They're good at following-up with us and our vet for things that require a prescription - even tracking me down one time when I mis-typed our vet's phone # in a form!  We'll continue to use them for years to come.

Edited to add on 8/15/17:  For Nationwide/Veterinary Pet Insurance customers - be sure to check your claims involving CPP purchases!  After years of submitting the CPP receipt for my dog's routine meds and being reimbursed for them, they're suddenly not accepting the emailed order receipt as documentation for the claim.  It appears they now require the invoice CPP includes in the box when it's shipped.<//Text>

CPP has been the cats meow and the dogs bark, when it comes to our pets prescription needs. They are very helpful and insightful, with great customer service and as always very timely with the meds and the price cost and savings is purrrrrrfect! You can't go wrong using CPP for all your pets meds. Give them a call today. Our dogs say it best, WHOOOOFFF!! Their seal of approval!< /review>

UPDATE 7/20 4:50pm: Received call yet again from this pharmacy but this time it was to tell me that they saw my negative review they've done everything within their time frame (24-72 hrs) and they've tried everything to rectify the situation and they feel it'd be best for me and them to cancel the order and refund my money. UPDATE as of 7/20 @ 3:30pm I missed a call asking for me to call back to confirm I wanted to move forward with my order as I have posted a negative review. Not ONCE have I asked for my order to be cancelled or refunded. In the message I was told I have to call back in order for my pets medication to ship. I'm sure they don't do that with all of their customers? Are they literally trying to hold my pets medication hostage because they're mad I posted an HONEST review for customers to save them the headache? This is laughable. I called the pharmacy to again confirm that I wanted this medication in fact I wanted it shipped yesterday not today and that's why I made multiple calls to them and paid for expedited shipping. They are ridiculous. Don't order from this online pharmacy. I ordered a medication from them, when ordering, I selected expedited shipping as it was not supplied locally and I needed it quickly. Had it stated when selecting my delivery method that there is a 24-72 hr processing time I would not have paid additional money just so my pets medications could arrive the same time they would've if I had not upgraded the lead time with shipping. When you place your order it asks for your pets name, your information as well as the vet's information all but the fax number was provided to them. The fax number for the vet isnt even a required field to complete your order and because of that, I had assumed that they either google the vet clinic to call them to request the fax number or they google it and are able to pull the fax number associated with vet's office and number. My pet is seen at a banfield. They didn't attempt to find the correct fax number to submit the auth form. They blindly selected a petsmart that doesn't even have a banfield pet hospital associated with it. I receieved an email from this pharmacy that the auth form was sent at 11:05am arizona time. I called my vet to confirm at 1pm arizona time and low and behold they hadn't receieved a form. I called the pharmacy again and asked them to confirm the fax number with me. Not only was it not mistaken with the vet's phone number, but it was not even close to being the location I entered on my order! Again the location they sent it to doesn't even have a Banfield. I spoke with my vet at 2:30pm and they said they authorized the med and that they faxed it back. At 2:55 I called the pharmacy because at 2:18 I had received an email from them stating that they contacted my vet's offfice for authorization and that they couldn't locate my pet and declined the auth. I asked the rep Corina why I receieved this email in the first place and she was pretty much saying it had to do with the initial request that was sent back at 11am. So I asked if I was going to be receiving a confirmation email that they did in fact receive authorization from the vet and she said the next email I'll receive is when the product is packed for shipping. I asked if it was going out today and she said most likely tomorrow. I told her that this is exactly what I was trying to avoid because I've been making multiple calls back and fourth because the vet refused to talk to the pharmacy and the pharmacy refused to talk to the vet they made the customer do all the work WHILE BEING AT WORK. Corina had attitude, I asked if there was a complaint department or supervisor I could speak to and she said there were no supervisors available. She was of no help as were all the people I spoke with at this pharmacy. They may not care about your pet getting a needed medication but I know the pet owners care about their pets wellbeing. This is the first and last time I will order from them. Please for the sake of your sanity dont give them your business. Go through 1800petmeds.< /text>

2 orders....both wrong.....could have possibly killed my dog...... I didn't catch the 1st one, they sent the wrong dosage.  Shame on me for not checking.  But believe me, I checked the second one.

My Labradoodle is 13 yrs old and still kicking. He needs some very expensive heart medication. California Pet Pharmacy has saved us a lot of money since he was diagnosed in 2014, I am from Illinois and we get that medication within a few days after ordering. I have had nothing but good service from this company. I thank you for keeping our best dog we've ever had with us for a little longer...<//text>

First, the good.  CPP says they have Optimmune for my pug's eyes.
Now, the reality.  No delivery five days after ordering.  I live 60 miles away.
No way to order refills on line.
HAVING TO WAIT 20 MINUTES ON HOLD TO SPEAK WITH"DANIELLE" WHO OBVIOUSLY DIDN"T CARE!
NEVER again!
My advice:  Find somewhere else to order from and save a little money as well!<//review>

<Review>Should have read the reviews first, sigh.  The price was lower, but we received a leaky bottle of shampoo with a lot missing and Trifexis that wasn't in the box (and thus couldn't qualify for the rebate either).  When I contacted customer service about the shampoo they offered to credit me back for "the amount that leaked out"--no apology about the leak, the mess, the poor shipping.  A few weeks later, when I went to use the Trifexis, only four pills were in the bottle (not the six I paid for).  When I contacted them this time to ask for the missing two pills to be sent, California Pet Pharmacy's response was once again NOT to apologize or offer any empathy.  The simply responded that they check all the shipments.  That's it, they are not sending the missing pills.  Incredible--worst customer service I've ever experienced.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I had a great experience--little long on call waits for customer service; called them back to make sure fax was sent to vet, and then again when it didn't show as returned. Cust. Service very helpful & friendly, lady personally faxed order to Vet; their system online didn't show it--at first, but vet faxed right back; order was completed, mailed out midnight next day, arrived here 3 days later from west to east coast. Great prices; I've not had faster service from other online pet pharmacies. My vet said they have a lot of clients who've used Cal Pet Pharmacy with no problem. The negative reviews may well be due to the fact that those who have a negative experience are much more likely to write a review. Go to the CPP FB page and you see an awful lot of likes--lots more than reviews. I can't be sure of the cause, but I do know I received five star service, and maybe staying on top of things and calling back the friendly customer service reps helped..</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I have a 6 year old pooch with bad knees, buying pet meds has become something I've had to learn to budget for. I'll be the first to say I want the best for my pet but living on a fixed income sometimes makes things hard. Cal pet rx has helped me so much, they have the best prices I've seen. From time to time the hold time gets longer than usual, (which I can undestand companies get busy) but one time while on hold I took a look at the website and was able to get my order placed in under 5 mins. All in all really happy with my expirinces with this pharmacy would recommend to anyone hands down.</Text>

<Review>I contacted CPP on Thursday by email with a prescription that needed a request from my vet.  They contacted my vet the same day, and she returned the prescription that day.  I called on Friday to verify CPP had the order.  They stated the script was already in the pharmacy and would be sent out that day.  We received the meds on Monday as promised and could not be happier.  We will certainly use this company again as we paid half what our vet charged.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7< /GmapID></record>

< review>
I placed an order with California Pet Pharmacy (CPC) on September 22nd.  I had not heard from them by September 29th so I sent them an email asking the status of my order.

Nicole from CPC responded by saying my order was on a “slight back-order” but they expected to ship the order in 7 – 10 business days. She added, “Please let us know whether you would like to keep the order or if you would like us to cancel and refund the order”.

I responded that I did indeed wish to cancel my order.

Jessica from CPC responded: “Your order has been cancelled. There is nothing further that you will need to do since your order was never fulfilled and your card was not charged”.

Well, that wasn’t exactly true – my card had been charged on September 23rd.  It also appears that my order wasn’t cancelled either since I received an email on September 30th stating that my order had shipped on September 30th (the day after I cancelled it).

So I sent them another email to ask them why my cancelled order shipped? I also informed them that I was going to file a dispute with my credit card provider – which I did.

Jessica from CPC responded: “We do apologize for the inconvinces, we did cancel this order unfortunately a duplicate was made on our end and just automatically sent out a tracking number. We do apologize once again we will go ahead and issue you your credit back for this order”.

I guess I’ll see if that happens although it doesn’t matter because my credit card company has already credited my account.

I’ll never order from CPC again. I would rather pay twice the price than be lied to.<//review>

<time>1442576451151<//time><rate>5</rate><text>I, too, am shocked at the bad reviews. I have been using CPP for over 6 months and we order a very expensive med ($300/month) that is 5 times as at the vet. Cpp has the best price on this particular med, hands down. The second reorder was taking too long and I called and got a very nice rep who said they were waiting on the vet to approve the refill and it was my vets error giving the fax to the wrong doctor and it sat on her desk when she was on vacation. Totally not the pharmacy's fault. Since that time I have had nothing but FAST shipping and great communication (the communication emails are always keeping me in the loop as to how fast my script is refilled). I'm very happy with CPP and will continue to use them in the future.</text>< Pics>

Wow, I am blown away by the negative reviews. I have been ordering vetoryl capsules from CPP for the past 6 months, and other than some back and forth when we first started (contacting the vet, etc), everything has been a breeze. Orders generally take 1-2 weeks to arrive and ship within 24-48 hours. I have always gotten free shipping, because I spend over $75, and I live in AK. Never has an order been messed up. The prices are amazing, so if you are on the fence, I would suggest you call CPP first, then decide if you want to order. FYI, they are VIPPS certified, which is an important distinction.

One star removed because they are not set up to have user accounts, so I have to enter all my information each time I order.< /Text>

<Text>These guys have been nothing but trouble from my very first order.  I'm an understanding person and I gave them several tries at it but today I finally changed back to my original pet pharmacy with Pet Food Direct.  They're about 10 dollars more but not ONCE did I have issues with them fulfilling my orders.

When I first switched to CPP they claimed to not be getting the faxes being sent over by my vet.  I personally watched my vet's office put in their number and send it off, TWICE.  And I have the fax receipts to prove it.  Eventually, well after my pets had ran out of their meds (I'd started the whole thing about 3 weeks before that), they shipped off our order.  All was well until they needed a new prescription.  They faxed over a request to my vet, the vet replied back.  They claimed once again they received nothing.  Our last order, I placed and never received any receipt in email that it was received, nor was I sent a shipping notice.  I didn't even know if it was received until it showed up on my doorstep!  And finally, 10 days ago I placed an order for my senior dogs' pain meds.  That was PLENTY of time, there was a refill in place, one would think there'd be no problem.  Nope.  I got no notice that they received the order.  They claim to not be having issues with their website, and if that's the case then it's obviously employee incompetency.  Inexcusable.

I've given these guys NUMEROUS attempts to get things right but this last one was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I'm moving our business back to our original vendor, one whom I highly recommend, Pet Food Direct.  Their prices might be a little more but they didn't charge shipping, their website works, I have an account that I can pull up on their website, and they have autoship.  All of which CPP does not have.  Not worth the pittance of savings.  I'd actually transferred to these guys in the hopes that we'd receive the meds sooner, they're located only 3.5 hours away in Hayward, CA.  I'm in Reno, NV.  You'd assume it'd be a no-brainer.  I learned not to assume.  I had a great things going with Pet Food Direct and their pharmacy.  I shouldn't have messed with a good thing.

Bottom line: BEWARE of CPP!!!  Their prices may seem lower, probably because they have people working there who have no idea what they're doing.  DON'T bring them your business.  You'll regret it.  Lord knows I do.< /Text><time>1456252086664</time>< UserId.>

<date>1433431017633< /date><rating>1</rating><text>They are very disorganized.  I placed an order on May 28th and when I heard nothing by June 4th, I had to call them and the very nice but not well informed rep said they would look into it.  Then we get a call with no message other than to call back.  I do call back and get Irene and I am told they dont know why they called me.  I asked if they got in touch with my vet and they didnt know.  She said she would call me back "in about an hour or two".  So I had my vet call them at this point to move it along since nothing was happening.  Irene calls me back (within the two hours) and says its all set and being shipped out today. That was Monday June 4th.  I said when will it get here now? She said I think Friday. I said since this was a huge hassle and confusion it really should be sent overnight.  She said she would check with management.  Then I had to prompt them on Tuesday June 5th because guess what...it wasn't mailed yet. A label was then created on Tuesday however the shipment was not sent overnight and now we are looking at a Saturday delivery which means it went out on Wednesday.  Very disorganized and frankly they don't care or take ownership. There are plenty of pharmacies I can use and will do so in the future.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808f96955fe6a5fd:0xf64586495c805be7</GmapID></record>

<Text>I just recently found California Pet Pharmacy by looking for a vaccine distributor with a highly positive review!  Well - I thought I'd found it... UNTIL I actually did business with California Pet Pharmacy.  They had the vaccination listed with the amount it would cost to ship it on several third party sites.  When I was linked to the website and checked out with the vaccination I felt that I was getting a fair deal from a reputable source.  There were several other sources with the same or cheaper prices - but I chose this one for its "Great"  ratings online.  Boy was I in for a shock!  The next day I received a call from a "restricted" phone number.  The person on the line kept nervously repeating himself - although he was far from clear.  All I kept hearing about was an ADDITIONAL $35 dollar charge that I was going to incur - due to a change in the shipping criteria.  I had already paid 6 dollars for shipping so that would have made the total shipping charge over $40 for an item less than six ounces and slightly bigger than a cell phone.  Being in business myself I can understand that misunderstandings or mistakes happen so I called back figuring things would be worked out.  I mentioned that I used the shipping method populated by THEIR website and that I didn't intend to pay an additional $35 on top of the $6 dollars I had paid to have an item shipped overnight.  I mentioned that their were other options far cheaper and that it was not really fair to have me enter all my credit card information, name, address and other info online to just have someone bump my cost to almost an additional amount  half the cost of the item I was purchasing.  This is exactly the reason a large percentage of people do not buy things online these days with information being stolen - such as in the recent example with Target and the stolen credit card information. Instead of helping - the manager at California Pet Pharmacy was short and abrupt - only offering me cancellation.  Of course I had to cancel.  Their business model seems to be - BAIT and SWITCH to a higher price.  Well fortunately there are plenty of other options as far as buying pet meds - like Petmeds - Jeffers - KVvet - Drs Foster and Smith - etc etc that ARE reputable.  Even IF California Pet Pharmacy had THE best price online - I could NEVER trust them again enough to try to buy something from them.  Most likely I would just be on the bad end of another phone call the very next day bumping up the price!< /Text>< Pictures>

Inept , Incompetent sums up my thought of them
After ordering 2 bottles of Vetsulin and 2 boxes of syringes for my dog online for They called the next day saying it would be an additional $65 for the Vetsulin , not honoring the website Total . I asked customer service  why I was being charged double the shipping rate as you are putting both bottles in 1 box So I canceled the Vetsulin
I called 3 days later asking if my syringes had shipped . NOPE they were too stupid to give me Vet a call</text>

Steered me towards a different med that did not do what I described as needed.
Half hour on hold to resolve.  Gave up.

<rate>1<//rate><text>Horrible customer service, they messed up my order and they would not fix it. I was a customer for two years, I requested the same order as previous times, it has always been the same, they only send me half of the medications at the same price as previous order and they would not apply the coupon to the order already sent, only on future orders. And of course you can not return the order already received, don’t use them. Not worth your time< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Ordered from them a week ago, the only recently contacted my vet for the prescription, the vet faxed it back. Haven't heard anything, can't get in touch with anyone, so I'm cancelling the order and just getting the pills through my vet.

I'll read the online reviews next time before using a service. There is truth in it.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rating>1< /rating>< UserId.>

WARNING!!!!! The worst company I have ever purchased anything from.  BEWARE...DON'T BUY ANYTHING.  Read the reviews.  Zero customer service.  They talk about going to their supervisor and just put you on endless hold.<//Text>

<Text>I ordered pills for my dog and requested expedited shipping (& agreed to pay for it).
It has been one week (& 5 business days) and still no pills.  I even live in the same
state as CPP.  What terrible service.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Name>Anthony Griffis</Name><Date>1423857521160<//Date><rate>1</rate><Review>Ordered from them a week ago, the only recently contacted my vet for the prescription, the vet faxed it back. Haven't heard anything, can't get in touch with anyone, so I'm cancelling the order and just getting the pills through my vet.

I'll read the online reviews next time before using a service. There is truth in it.< /Review>< Pictures>
