We where rear ended on the 91 freeway. My wife was injured and needed hospitalization. When I contacted the other parties insurance company they denied our claim. I called Sweet James and they sent an investigator to review our case. Within 2 days of signing on with Sweet James the other insurance company accepted our claim. Sweet James handled all the billing and located local doctors to treat my wife. In the end we ended up with a much larger settlement than we originally thought. The employees at Sweet James where always friendly and helpful. They really looked out for us.</Text>

Still waiting on accts to be settle and a check to me for a broken neck. We settled nov 2020 and if i had known this long would have taken to trial. No money equals no physical therapy after a c3 to c7 fusion. I have one bill i know threatening for collection. They were quick to help but slow to finish</Review>

Kevin Crockett was our attorney, and he was absolutely wonderful when dealing with our accident case. He was extremely personable, professional, responsive, and willing to jump through hoops for us.
I cannot recommend him enough.
My husband is active duty military, and Kevin was extremely accommodating to working the systems of Tricare and the Marine Corps.
He was incredibly honest, and always gave it to me straight (which I admire highly, especially in an attorney).
If you ever need a personal injury lawyer, Kevin is your guy!
Kevin and everyone at Sweet James has been so considerate, and they really go the extra mile for you.
I told Kevin this, but I will say it here too; I would give Kevin and this firm 100 stars if I could.<//text>

A very nice associate attorney greeted me within 4 minutes and interviewed me in a nice conference room. She asked pointed polite questions and walked me through the legal retention agreement.

The head of the law firm ("Sweet James" Bergener) came into the conference room to ask further questions and welcome my business.  They made me feel I'd come to the right law firm.

In short, it was a very good experience in the midst of a very unhappy circumstance.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>This was my first accident, I honestly didn’t know what to expect but these guys made it so easy for
Me, they handled everything for me and made it completely stress free, Rachana, Sarah, and Noah are the best team I could have asked for as they worked extra hard on my case to provide me with the best of care and representation. I recommend if you can to ask for those three specifically as they deserve a raise as far as I am concerned. And again thank you to the firm that was there for me in my time of need, Sweet James!! You kindness and amazing service will not be forgotten as I will be recommending you to everyone!! Thanks again.

<review>I really wish I could give NEGATIVE stars. I just have to write a review after seeing all the commercials on tv. I would NOT recommend this law office, I was not keep informed about my case, I had to do a lot of the “leg work” to get my case settled and then they took more money for themselves than what I received in the settlement. I will never use them again and will NEVER ever recommend them.< /review><Rating>1<//Rating><user>106469443890760114380</user>< name>

I have had the pleasure of working with Sweet James for over 10 years and to this day....he remains 'Sweet James'.  ALWAYS focused on the injured with relentless determination to win for his clients  and get them back to whole.  Super Lawyer designation along with being awarded THE BEST ATTORNEYS IN AMERICA!   Sweet James in the people’s attorney.....and for all right reasons....no one compares!  If injured in any sort of accident....the call to make is the Sweet James!</text>

Ryan Cooper helped me with my case. I had a bad rear-end collision during work, and because of my injury lasting longer than expected, I decided to reach out to this firm. James was one of the customers at a restaurant I used to work in my college year, and I remember him being such a sweet, kind guy, so I decided to reach out. Then I was introduced to Ryan after providing my information, and he was just wonderful! Very responsive, professional, and most importantly, he was very informative and kept me updated throughout my case. I have nothing but compliments. He even introduced me his friend who practices labor laws when I mentioned I was in need of employment law attorney. I cannot be more thankful for him. Thank you so much!!!<//Text>

For folks looking for a competent attorney and top-notch firm, contact Sweet James and ask for Megan Lane.  Megan, our dedicated attorney, provided professional, responsive, and top-notch customer service throughout the course of managing my son's physical injury case.  She is efficient and effective right down to the last details of reviewing the financials with us and providing tracking information for the check received.  Great experience and we highly recommend this firm and seek out for Megan Lane.<//Review>

I cannot begin to describe how helpful Chloe and Phil were during this time! I experienced my first accident ever and I would’ve never imagined it would have gone down so smoothly. If I’m being honest it wouldn’t have been nearly as easy if I didn’t have the help from Mr. Younglove and Chloe. They were both very attentive and very informative about everything that was going on, keeping me in the loop with what steps we were on with my case and making sure that I was ok. I’m very grateful or their help and recommend anyone needing an attorney to contact these wonderful people!</text>

Sweet James helped me during one of my worst weeks. My car was completely totaled when I got hit from behind while stopped at a stoplight and I was in serious pain, but Sweet James acted fast to help me turn the situation around. Unlike a lot of lawyers I've worked with, my attorney at Sweet James, Ryan Cooper, was always quick to respond and fill me in about everything that was going on. They helped me find everything I needed to get treatment and made it as easy as possible, and they helped me get compensated. I hope I'm never in an accident like this again, but if I am I'm definitely gonna call Sweet James.</Review>

Sweet James and his team are just simply amazing!  I'm giving them 10 stars!! I'm so glad that I made that first phone call to him! I was rear ended while stopped at a light, I will never forget that night. The following day Sweet James sent over his team to get the process started on my case. Sarah was so caring and compassionate with me ,always in contact with me via phone or email with any updates that was happening with my case. I had the pleasure of speaking with Michael, he was so caring and amazing!  Rachana was super helpful towards the end of my case!! I knew I had the best team! I will be referring friends and family to them! I just want to say thank you  for everything  you guys did for me and my family we were truly blessed to have you all!!</review>

I was in a car accident with a buddy of mine. I reached out to family members, and they suggested Sweet James. I received the proper and effective treatments for my back pain during this accident. The types of procedures I have gotten does not compare to the previous ones I have had. When I had a question, Chloe was there to respond to me promptly. I must say the service they provided is fantastic! They professionally handled everything and exceeded my expectations. Definitely recommend!!! Thank you Phil Younglove.</Review>

<Text>My heart is sooo thankful for Sweet James. Having them work on my case has been such a pleasant experience. Before Sweet James, my case was in the hands of a very futile law firm—not going to say who—but let’s just say I patiently waited nearly two lonnnng years with very little contact and hope of resolution from them. It was a nightmare. As soon as Sweet James took over my case I felt so relieved. Sweet James always kept in contact with all updates and made tremendous progress during a short time (4 months) of working on my case. So grateful! Now I can finally see light at the end of the very long dark tunnel.< /Text>< pics>

Ryan Cooper’s team at Sweet James has been such a breath of fresh air in my daughter’s case. A few weeks back she was hit by a drunk driver, totaling her car, and we feared it was going to be a nightmare to handle but after being referred to their office they have handled everything, even for her car paid out ASAP! It is so nice to see my daughter able to rest and focus on getting better rather then stressed out and overwhelmed. Thank you Sweet James for all the hard work you’re doing and peace of mind you are bringing to our family daily!< /Text>

<Review>Sweet James helped me during a time of great pain that I was dealing with after an accident. I was a passenger in a rear end accident at a dead stoplight that completely totaled the vehicle I was in. Sweet James attorney, Ryan Cooper, helped me resolve my back and neck issues from the accident fast! Ryan always kept checking in on me to make sure I was doing well since the accident, and answered all the questions that I had. Ryan did a fantastic job keeping me in the loop with my case. I would highly recommend Sweet James to anyone that is going through an injury after a car accident.<//Review>< pictures>

My husband and I were hit by a car from behind about a year ago, and Ryan Cooper and his team at Sweet James handled our injury case. They were professional, thorough and responsive and managed to get our case settled with an even better outcome than we expected. Definitely hoping nothing like this happens again, but if it does we know who to call!</Text>

<text>As a fire captain and first responder for over 30 years in and around LA County, I have seen too many devastating accidents through the course of my career. Knowing that there are people like Steve Mehr, James Bergener, and the  entire staff of Sweet James to guide these people through tough times leaves me hopeful when we go our separate ways. The successful client-oriented partnership of Mehr and Bergener has created a powerhouse firm that truly strives to provide the best results and support for each and every client throughout their case. There is no other firm than Sweet James who I'd recommend to my friends and family when they tell me they had an accident."< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

My case is currently being handled every, every poorly. In August of 2019 I was in a car accident and the law firm received my check for $15,000; and I only receive less than 5% of my claim and I been told to hold off until April 2020. However everyone was paid in December 2019. I do not recommend this law firm if you have been financially inconvenience by your car accident because this law firm will take at less 6 to 9 month to give you any compensation. I authorize my settlement check by phone with Mr. Copper on December 6, 2019 and I haven’t receive a full compensation yet! Only excuses and I’m still injury and lost my job for being off on medical leave too long; base on what their doctors recommended..</Text>

What's good enough for Petros and Money is good enough for me. I called Sweet James after i was in a car accident. The entire back end of my car was smashed in and i was in a lot of pain. Sweet James fought the insurance company and got me money for my injuries. Thank you Sweet James and Go Dodgers!<//Review>

<Text>Very easy to work with, returns call in a timely fashion. I would  recommend Sweet James to anyone in a accident. I have seen some negative reviews regarding length of time ect. These things take time no insurance company's want to pay out. The process is simple there is no out of pocket cost. I was able to pick my own chiropractor and everything was pretty simple and straight forward. I was in my accident on Nov 30 2019, my case was just closed May 15 2020. I believe this was done in a timely fashion, giving account that the insurance company was awful to deal with no return call, giving the run around every step of the way. Did not accept liability till end of January. I had two wonderful representatives   Rachana Tataria and Sarah Nahgee (Sorry if I butchered that) only because Sarah went on maternity leave to start a family, hope your doing well! Anyways great people great company 5 starts all the way.< /Text>< Pictures>

I was in a nasty wreck on December 15th. Sweet James Bergener's firm was the first call I made. 3 months later I am feeling like I made a great decision. Phil Younglove and Cloe Hunt were not only professional, they were also caring and devoted to making sure that I was paid what I was owed. Thanks a million< /Review>

I got into a car accident in Arizona and was advised by a friend to lawyer up and she recommend bergener. I had never dealt with lawyers before so i had no idea what to expect what to do or anything. I was pretty nervous. But jason and savana were very helpful in explain things breaking them down more than they should have to just so i could clearly understand everything that was going on. Communication was great! Always reaching out to me with updates or calling me back asap if they missed my call. They made me feel like i was in good hands and i truly just let them handle everything and it turned out AMAZING! Couldnt be happier with the results!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>A car accident is a very traumatic experience that can happen to anyone.
Being injured in a car accident is a horrible experience that you don't want to handle yourself.
The Insurance companys will not take you seriously as an individual and will do everything in their power to mitigate their responsibilities.
I operate my own business and my truck is the center of that business. Any down time is lost revenue and possibly even the loss of existing clients for me.
I lost plenty of both because of this accident.
I didnt have fancy demands. Fix my truck, replace my equipment that was destroyed, fix my neck so I could turn my head again and reimburse me for my lost income.
Well after 2 neck surgeries and a year of PT my neck does what it's suppose to again.
My Truck was fixed and my equipment was replaced and once everything was said and done I recieved a handsome settlement for my lost income, pain and suffering.
Everything was taken care of.

All because of a phone call.

I was in a horrible place and the people at Sweet James took care of me when I couldn't do it for myself, helped heal my injuries and Aggressively Lawyered on my behalf.

Sweet James really did save the day for me and for that they have my deepest thanks!!!

I had my life changed in the quick of a traffic light last year. After the scurry of accident cleared and i drove my now humbled vehicle home . As i took a quick inventory of all that had just happened, I knew I would need a professional s help in this situation. I called Sweet James office as soon as i arrived home. Not needing emergency care ( thank God !) I knew i had more than one issue physically and I knew i was going to need help. By next morning i had a representative at my kitchen table answering questions and providing good information.
I became a client at this time. I was soon after introduced to my attorney Gabe Vigh. Little did i know at that time how important Mr Vigh was in my recovery and my family's protection.
The Culture in Sweet James's ,i found was everything i needed it to be, and beyond .
This culture allowed Gabe to walk with me through this ordeal,  from surgery to recover to more recovery and even some football talk ,when i just needed a voice on the other line. Always there , Perfect follow up. Compassion 1st class ! Gabe must have  to answered 100's of questions , some asked 2 or 3 times :).
Gabe and I also discussed expectations at great length,  never to waiver from our mission at hand ( my family's an my own security) I dont think i can properly express my thanks to James. Gabe , and to staff Elaina and Solidad thankyou so very much you ladies were there so many times from beginning to finish , alsi i want to mention an
Andrew the king of lien negotiators . But like i said earlier I owedo much to Gabe Vigh my attorney ( my Friend! ) Gabe your my brother ! ( little brother lol ) Thankyou Gabe from my heart and my family's heart.
Your friend
John   peace dude ...peace :)<//Text>

THE SKIES THE LIMIT!!! What a location! This is the place to be for family brunches, cocktails at sunset and I look forward to knowing more. I just discovered The Riviera Hills Restaurant and Lounge and now have been there for Easter brunch buffet on the terrace with my family, casual dinner in the Lounge with my nine year old niece, and again on the terrace for a Sunday brunch with friends. Kevin in the Lounge is awesome and enthusiastic about sharing info about the area too. I've yet to know all the names, but I could see the staff's smiling eyes, (since all were wearing COVID masks). There is plenty of parking, I've made reservation for Easter, but the other times I just showed up and we were immediately seated. Clear Lake is a spectacular place, but I'm more impressed with the friendly people who I continue to meet from there. I look forward to my next visit. FYI, the brunch Eggs Benedict and endless champagne was pretty darn perfect. Worth every cent to enjoy this view and homemade food!<//Text>

<text>This place is awesome! Reminds me of a scene from an old movie with the classic decor, service, menu and ambience. The view alone is worth the price of the extremely tasty affordable food. Don't miss the bottomless champagne! I dine out at many over priced Sonoma Co restaurants all the time and would much rather be here. Delicious eggs Benedict and omelet.<//text>< user>

<Review>I wouldn't recommend this place. We were visiting family from out of town and made reservations as their site suggests. We arrive early to find an empty lobby and no employees in site. The lobby is filled with dingy old chairs stacked everywhere, outdated fliers and a fish tank that appears to not have been cleaned in the last decade. Maybe they're waiting for 2020. After standing around their "Please wait to be seated sign" for 15 minutes a waiter goes by not even acknowledging us. When he goes through a second time he asks if we are waiting to be seated. Clearly we are..  we tell him we are and had a reservation. To which he responds with "well, I'll see what I can do". The place is dead, the parking lot empty... After waiting another 10 minutes and no one bothering to return, we left. Based on the terrible service and disgusting conditions of the lobby I feel we dodged an equally dissapointing meal. I have never witnessed such poor service or conditions of a restaurant, especially of one that requests reservations.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We asked the waitress 3 times about our dinner.  There was a band playing there which led to LOTS of people.  It was severely understaffed for the amount of people.  Kaos and poorly organized.  When pointed out to the owner, she said,  "well, this is Lake county."</text>< pics>

<text>Recently celebrated my birthday with 14 guests at Riviera. Kevin, the manager, in-advance arranged for us a table with a terrific view, and I was able to work out a great menu with the chef, including off-the-menu dishes. Everything was over the top, and could not have been any better. We are all looking forward to our next visit. Cheers to all of the staff!</text>< username>

We've visited the restaurant several times, and I'd normally recommend this location, but this visit found the restaurant VERY cold and slow service. Our waitress was nice and thorough with the specials, but was MIA most of the night. The bar was full and very clearly a priority for all wait staff. Thankfully the busser was present or we may have never received our forgotten refills, dessert or check.  The food was great but the lack of service really brought down the value.<//review>

The Philosophical Society Group meets every month for brunch the 2nd Sunday each month. We have the Riviera Hills Restaurant on the "every other month" rotation. We usually have a pretty good sized group of 30-35 people. Kevin (manager) is so accommodating and does a very good job getting us all served as fast as he can. His help are very professional/courteous and they see to all our needs! The Chef does a great job with the food! Tastes great and the food is presented very well!! The Riviera Hills Restaurant is VERY GOOD! I recommend you try it sometime soon!!
The views are awesome!!</text>

<Review>View is Great, however, food not so great. Food was fair to good, nothing to really write home about, except view. Btw, also a little pricey for fair food... Kinda bland, but, guess ppl. watching sodium intake</Review>< pics>

<review>Love this place. This restaurant has the best view in Lake county. Breathtaking sunsets so good they will have you and everyone else leaving the table to go outside and take a picture. Only open for dinner Thursday thru Sunday, this place is truly a hidden gym. Tucked away atop the hills of the Kelseyville Rivieras, this restaurant and clubhouse has a nice feel to it. You almost feel as though you are stepping into a movie sometimes because the ambience is so familiar and welcoming. The menu is a nice change of pace from a lot of the bar food you find around the area. The chef clearly knows what they are doing and you can tell from the menu and the different exquisite collections. Take the family to dinner or your significant other on a date here, you won't be sorry. The bar is a hoppin place on Saturday night and usually is packed with people dancing and a band playing live music. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!< /review>< pictures>

Awful food, no taste, lukewarm, not worth the money.   3 out of 4 of us wouldn't even eat much.  Very mediocre and high prices.  Will not be going back.</Review>

<Text>Had my gas dryer converted to propane with them. The tech that came out was very nice and did a wonderful job. They give a reasonable time frame rather than making you wait around all day, and the tech called when he was on his way. Also able to make an appointment for just 2 days from when I called. And the only people that would service lucerne valley.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I had a 11am appointment. Technician called and said he was finished with his prior job and could he come early. He arrived 30 minutes early. Had on a face mask and went to work. Diagnosed the problem, fixed the problem, and tested my oven. Working great. This company will get all my business and I’m telling all my friends. Thank you Adco.<//Text>< GmapID>

I call at 8:55 am and the owner answers the phone.
I simply ask if He’s open today?
He responds “I answered the phone didn’t I ?”
I won’t be spending any money with his business anymore.
Better off with Amazon.</Text>

<text>I called Adco at 10 am concerning my washing machine that needed repair work, they were very professional and polite told me a technician would be here by 1pm. The repairman Justin who was very knowledgeable and polite had my machine repaired in less than 20 minutes, and the price was very reasonable. I highly recommend  Adco. I give the 5 plus stars< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c3673058464ceb:0x535232c1e9fc8efb<//Gmap_id><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

I called Adco about a problem with my washing machine. The repair man, Justin, came out even sooner than they said. He found out in a small amount of time that it probably wasn't even my washer, but how it's hooked up. He was honest and gave me suggestions on how to fix. He didn't even charge me. Everyone I spoke with at Adco were honest and friendly....highly recommend!< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Great service. I have call them many times over the last 15 years about my appliances that indicated malfunctions or unusual noises or about parts. They always show insight, answer questions to best of their ability. If I need to know where in the washing machine or dryer to replace a possible burned out part, they give some tips. They are knowledgeable, with years of experienced, reasonable in price as well as professional. I would recommend anyone who need washer, gas/electric dryer or hot-water heat parts to first try Adco Appliances

I fixed both my old washer and dryer for a few dollars buying parts from them. Go to YouTube  and search the problem your machine has and if you own a screw driver and pliers you can fix it yourself.</text>

< review>
Went there yesterday for a dryer belt. He didn't have it but said he would be getting one today after 1. He said to call him after 1. I did, and no delivery yet. He said Call back after 2:30. I called back twice and was put on hold both times and after 5 minutes of them not getting back to me each call, i hung up. Called Midway, & they have my dryer belt in stock for cheaper than Adco.</review>

<Review>I used ADCO for parts once before and my experience was great. This time, I did not have time to deal with the issue myself so I called ADCO and asked them to refer me to a repair man. He came out and quoted me $200 to repair my machine. A fair price but more than the machine is worth. so I decided i would do it my self. I invested $65 to confirm my diagnosis. So far so good. Then I called ADCO to get the part. This is where it goes south. They told me that the part had to come from the manufacturer and it cost $204. A quick google search finds the part all over the place for $55 to $75. I called Midway appliance and they have it in stock for $99 and they are a retail outlet. So ADCO, here is one star for lieing to me and trying to rip me off. By the way, its part # WP8182634 check it for yourself.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>The girl that did my nails was in such a rush to get it over with. When I saw the end product I was shocked. I have never seen nails this bad before. Edges were sharp, uneven, and the to was bumpy. All edges were showing. I paid her for her time, and did not tip. I went home and remove them.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdt9NFZDH38N1jk9j3ZKcIhQgej4GyY6kRjDGB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiwLKXyuyN80M6_ZVOxJQORKrFrYK0p7nUxj2p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

I called to make an appointment for 3-D nails with Jack. I started asking questions as it is someone new we wanted to see how long Jack had been doing the 3-D nails. The guy on the phone was terribly rude and said “oh my God you know what whatever see you“ and hung up. Find somewhere else to get your nails done!< /Text>

I usually do not leave reviews because I never have a reason to, but I came in for a regular pedicure and I was highly upset with how they treated me. The pedicurist burned my fourth right toe which resulted with profuse bleeding. The pedicurist then proceeded to add nail glue on the wound. After that incident, she “accidentally” hurt me once again. Lastly, I specifically requested white for my color of choice, which she then insisted of me choosing black. I’m sorry but I expected a lot from a “professional.” I know these reviews may not mean anything to them, but for anyone who’s indecisive in coming here, please don’t, at least not for a pedicure.< /text>

The man who started off giving me a pedicure was really nice and gentle, but gave an aggressive massage. Switching over to getting my acrylics done, he was the one to start them off. He took maybe 45 minutes trying to apply the nail.. then started costing the nail which took another 4 l5 minutes. They eventually had me switch over to this lady, her name started with a K, I can’t remember it. She hurt me 4 times during, because she was trying to get me out of there. The previous man had gotten the dip powder under my acrylic and she called him over to yell at him in front of me. Overall, very slow, then very rushed and rude. I will not be going back here. Also my nails are so thick, they’re so hard to take off. I’m worried it’s going to ruin my natural nails.<//Review>

Man charged me $55 for a French tip Round
Came here because my sisters nails looked beautiful but the man
-Burned my finger
-left all the nails uneven
-Did it really quick even though I had an appointment (45 min)
-left a lot of acrylic under my nails!

Feel like they over charged me and I paid 10 less for my sister who got designs and long nails

Rather pay less for the same at Walmart</Text>

<Text>So came with 3 others and had the worst manicure experience, tech did not file down my nail correctly was snagging on everything, nail beds were left untouched and others with me had nail polish coming off hrs after leaving. Called management he said come back we will make it all good. Just left and nope they didn’t. I asked them to take off gel full set (painful) and asked for basic manicure WOW not properly buffed or filed. Just plain awful , I will post pic< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Quality of nails has gone down since this place opened. Used to love going here. The last few times I’ve been havebeen absolutely disappointing. Especially today. I made an appointment for my friend and I. One right after another with the same nail tech. I felt she was rushing through my appt. I wanted a new set she only did a fill because she had another appointment which was mine? Technically?<//review></record></dataset><record>

Overpriced , unskilled manicurists lacking basic cuticle removal. All they are good at as I observed they glue long claws for younger generation. My first and final business with them😡👎< /Review>

<date>1593792796659< /date><rating>3< /rating><review>Asked for ombre coffin nails with leopard. I don't know what happened but he didn't do the ombre so I had him paint on ombre glitter. I showed him a picture that he frequently referenced to... He was very nice. A little over priced. Paid 70$ and I didn't even have ombre nails or any gemstones. I asked for gem stones but I changed my mind at the end. It was going to be 60$ but with gems it was $70. Tipped $10.. He still charged me for them and it was busy I didn't want to make a big deal ... I might try going again and being more specific. It looks like they are capable of doing a good job and I like that they have a lot of options for designs.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkSaXP3XF6iLthJKhA5Px36ApyPMy8ABqTgO0B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dafe7d04558a49:0x9d37b5cffb0b69e2<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>When we arrived they said they had no problem doing 2 people for pedicure and 1 person for pedicure manicure.  The two people finish their pedicure almost before they started on the third person's manicure and pedicure. When we mention this that they should have told us they  able to do them all together they said that we should have made appointments lecturing us. I reminded them if they were just honest and beginning it would be no disappointment we would have went somewhere else. My feet are still rough and although you can't tell in the picture the nail paint is Bumpy and on my thumb there is a glob across the top. The worst part about it is that still poor service and it's one of the higher priced nail salons in the area. Even with the 15% off which they're offering a free opening or new opening it is still not worth it since equality his subpar the extra lectures are unwanted and the service was not great. Thumbs down Diamond Nails get it together.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Absolutely lovely nail salon! The service is amazing and the people are very attentive and polite. I had Katie do my nails and they are amazing! All of the manicurists and pedicurists are extremely talented and they offer many different styles of design and color. They take their time and insure you get what you came for. I will definitely come back!<//Review>< Date>

Let me first say that my girlfriend has gotten her nails done here for months and never once been disappointed! The talent of the staff and especially the owner Jack is incredible. I've never seen anyone able to accomplish some of the intricate details and quality work that I've seen done here. If you're looking for one of the best nail salons in the valley you've found it!< /Text>

They are so amazing, they can do pretty much any design you ask for. I normally go with Jack, but this last time Tiffany did my nails and she was great!< /Review>

< Review>
I came to this place last Saturday November 7,2019  for a pedicure I payed 30 plus tips . When I went home I noticed that the person didn’t did a good job my toes weren’t painted right. I can’t understand how he missed it. Im pretty sure he know was he was doing. I won’t recommend this place.< /Review>

<Response>None<//Response><text>The person that gave me a pedicure, she didn't tell me her name kept trying to upsell. The least expensive pedicure was thirty dollars and was definitely not worth it.pretty much what I got for thirty dollars was my tie nails trimmed and polished and lotion rubbed on my legs only. Won't be going back.</text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Nice new shop , great color selection. Just a little bit pricey but I’m used to it because I like my nails long so I expect to pay more for the length . Good customer service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</text>

Worst pedicure ever. Even my hubby asked if i did it myself! My cuticles were not properly prepared and were visable in the cheap polish that barely lasted 2 days. Won't be back. Everyone was friendly just poor work.</Text>

<Review>I was charged about 120 for myself and another person. I had no design on mine and the other persons nails were done so thin that one broke off the same day I honestly want a refund. And then they demanded a tip as well . Mine are uneven as well. Everyone that has seen my nails ask me where I went so they stay away from there</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The park is empty due to covid so my family and I enjoyed a day teaching the grandkids how to play baseball.  What a wonderful day.</review>

<rating>4< /rating><review>Beautiful clear waters and pleasant hiking trails. We visited during the 2019 super bloom and were very impressed with the flowers, however the 10 dollar parking fee in addition to the 3 dollars per person enterance fee seemed a bit high, but still worth it.

Don't forget your sunscreen!

Can't swim in the lake (it's drinking water) but boats seem to be welcome.< /review>< pictures>

It could have 5stars but the restrooms are closed. A very nice place to stroll, jog, bike without having to think of social distancing over a crowded area. Going up the hills to the lake is the best and also going down. The parking is kinda expensive for one time parking fee I guess than getting the yearly membership. I guess it's worth it once you go there often. There is a nice trail down there. One of the best that can be found here in Hemet/San Jacinto aside from Simpson park that we can be proud of.</text>

It was a fun little adventure and the scenic route let's me remember what my small town living was like. Enjoyed seeing the community and recreation use to feed the growing future generations to grow in essential fun activities that will surely benefit them in more areas of their life than just learning to develop team skills and working with others. It was a fun night though it ended too soon. Look forward to the next trip out there.<//text>

<Review>Very cute small place to enjoy the pool. The staff is on point and polite. The snack shop is very affordable.  Paid $3 for sunscreen and snacks were about $1.50 or less.  Paid $8 per person. Was able to relax and enjoy the sun!</Review></record>

It's kid friendly, the park is big enough not to feel overcrowded and you can see your kids easily. They have snack bar. No pets. Extremely safe environment for the entire family.  Constant surveillance from the lifeguards.</text>

Cute affordable place to take your children swimming to cool off. I went one day it was drizzling they decided not to open. Even though it was drizzling it was hot hundred degree weather and they still refuse to open. It's just a bunch of kids that wanted to be inside chatting with each other and didn't care that the customers were outside waiting I don't think I will be returning< /Review>

I had a really great time there with my daughter and granddaughter. What, I don't understand, how the table behind us had a collapsible cooler, they had chips, not your chips, fruit drinks, peanut butter and jelly crustables, fresh fruit,  like watermelon, grapes.....ect. it says that no coolers are allowed. My granddaughter was saying why do they get to have food and we have to go to the car and get are food. What the heck is the policy on bring outside food?  Other than that, it's a great park, and I will visit again. I just couldn't explain it to my 4 year old granddaughter.  You need to fix this. Somehow they got through your search process. Someone in your staff is letting some people go through, there was more there than just this one table.😔< /Review>

It is a nice park. But many people only come to smoke cigarettes and drugs. I hope the police do something soon for our children.< /Review>

<Review>Ballfields are fantastic. Newer, very green. Great layout. Probably too much concrete. Would like to see more grass. Makes the area around the ballfields hotter. Trees are very slow growing. Not much shade.< /Review>< Pics>

They do all my work. Cars and pick ups look like new , years  down the road. Never a problem with them. Always friendly and quick on turnaround time. Recommended by most insurance companies. Been using the for over 20 years. They know us buy name. Yes, me again. What did you do now?  Always come back. Never ever be disappointed with the. They go the extra way!</Text>

<Review>First Impressions are everything
Hello my name is Charles Range I run a small landscaping company  a few  days ago i was in a car accident and after this horrible for myself.
I  decided to take my truck to Bruce's Body Shop  to get an estimate I have seen there work and it is beautiful i can not deny that. So i took off work early and headed to Bruce's Body Shop.
Once there I was meet by I believe her name was Deanna when i asked for an Estimate. The first thing she asked what Insurance did i have i said Guard insurance. She said" never heard of them we don't deal with them". Now that i do understand so I said i will pay you guys I would like the work done here. She refused to give me an estimate. My feelings where hurt i said something dumb and walked out.
My truck witch is my work truck  hauls me and my crew. Is my first impression to my customers. Is what i shine up on a Friday night to take the love of my life out for the night. It where i put my three girls in to take them to school what i drive to take my sons fishing.
Sincerely Yours

Horrible costumer service in the office , the lady that was doing my estimate refused to give me one saying they don't repair salvage cars just need the dent in my bumper fix not a big fix !Only went here because chase chevrolet referred me there. Felt like a burden there and like they didn't want my business the moment I went in . There's no parking felt there office set up looks like a living room converted to an office , they need to get actually chairs instead of a run down couch. I called previously twice to see what time they stop doing estimate not once did the lady over the phone mention they dont fix salvage cars or cars with certain insurance ... they should tell you that the moment you call about estimates so you don't waste time going down over there !!! Suggest going elsewhere ,where you're going to be welcomed at least !!!</Text>

I'd give 0 out of 5 if possible. So so rude. The lady in front of me was offered a ride immediately, I was never offered a ride, was never told I was done. Sat there way to long being ignored. Finally got up and asked ace they said they could only give me a ride if I lived in town. Apparently they don't like people with kids. Sorry but I'm a full time working mom and had to bring my kids.< /Text>

<Date>1540352374924<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Ordered the P1 special in a small size. The bowl diameter is smaller than I am used to, but it is quite deep so you still get plenty of food. The taste was good, and there was a good mix of different types of meat. The noodles were a nice chewy al dente texture. Would come here again.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSwPJiS0Q48BommfnsuLf05aW1NDvnbel-k8V1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNPD4B8NnEjKIrI9Q9n0xVDvBrwjw96M1XeXGr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Food is good, service is just alright
But what bothers me the most is that they say on the wedsite they are open on Saturday's
When they are not.
Just how difficult is to change your hours on Google ?
Went there 3 times
Place was closed
Not coming back</Review>

I had the rare beef PHO. Very good. The spring roll needs some work. The wrap was loose thus making it messy. Not a bad place. Very busy at lunch. Really nice customer service.<//text>

I wanted to make my own Pho/ Ramen bowl so I came here to only by the broth. The broth had a slight coconut taste, along with the traditional Pho flavor. They gave me some basil and cilantro to add to my To Go bag. I’ll be back and will recommend this place to my friends and family< /review>

<Review>Out server, Jennifer, was a great host and the food was flavorful.

We had the Chilean Sea Bass (very juicy), Uni Crab Pasta (best of the dishes) and Shaken Chicken (good, but a standard stir fry).

Will definitely come back for the Pho Evermore.</Review>< pics>

Some of the freshest, delicious and full of flavor Vietnamese food I’ve had in a long time. Also the cleanest Pho place I’ve ever been in. We were passing through on our way down south and found this little gem. I had the V1 House special and it was SPECIAL! Pork was well seasoned, beef has a wonderful charred glaze and shrimp
was not over cooked. Ask for a little bit of their peanut sauce and add a little fun to your noodles.< /Review>

Very nice pho spot sitting in the middle of Fairfax. The ambience is very laid back and it's worth coming to check out. The egg rolls are delicious and the phone is delicious. The meat balls are different from the typical type of meat balls I'm used to from a Vietnamese restaurant. It's like a mix between an Italian and Vietnamese meatball, but the result is delicious.

This place has one vegetarian option and it turns out to just be plain rice and tofu. So boring! Overpriced -this cost $11?!< /Review>

<review>Soup way to hot, had to wait 10 mins before I could even begin.   By then,  the noodles became mush.  Lower your soup temperature.<//review>< pictures>

<user>116531236720575049793<//user><Rating>2<//Rating><text>Friendly staff and cute restaurant name. However, the pho broth was lacking in flavor. Even with the seasonings on the side that were added, there were still some missing elements including the saltiness factor. Well, it's great if you're on low-sodium diet I suppose. I did not try anything else during my visit but I'm a little worried about the flavor profiles on some of the other menu items if the pho broth was a representation of what the restaurant has to offer.< /text><time>1495087058431</time><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80e90ed5a7035aa1:0x60049221e211c34b< /Gmap_id>< username>

10/5 stars.

Cheesy name, like many pho places.. not sure if there's a race somewhere to be the cheesiest. I digress.

Btw, I've tried many many Pho across SoCal. This is the best. No, this isn't a subjective opinion, if you don't like it.. there's something wrong with your taste buds.

Rich and creamy broth puts all other places to shame. Higher quality and delicious meat, the raw meat doesn't get hard and rubbery & the tripe was a bit cooked and doesn't stink. Absolute fan.

Okay, now the bad part. After you taste their pho, it's all downhill from there. You won't really be happy eating pho ever again. I'm serious.</Review>

< Review>
The best ever. I personally recommend in been in this city for ten years this it's the best it ever tasted farnone.
I highly recommend it The place is wonderful. Clean and in this pandemic they keep the safety measures on point. We will definitely be coming back and by the way for the holidays you could order family packs to go.<//Review>

Broken rice plates with grilled chicken (Cơm gà nương) was delicious and well assembled; the meat was flavorful and nicely grilled. The Bánh Xèo  (Vietnamese crepes) were kind of small and were not very crispy. The Phở Tái Bò Viên looked promising but I didn't try it this time.

Atmosphere is quite fresh, new and full of promise. It is very clean and I can tell the care about their cleanliness by how they prepare tables and serve their food.

I hope this place makes their bánh xèo bigger and more crispy, but other than that it's a great place to have Vietnamese food</Text>

<review>I liked it. Though the flavor of the phõ soup can be more favorable. They have a good menu with lots to choose.
I love the music they put on Even though it's in their language but sounds nice.<//review>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) The price is reasonable and the taste is above a certain level. Spring rolls and egg rolls are not recommended.

The place is small, but it's very cozy and comfortable. The service is also excellent. They are all very attentive, professional, and will gladly offer suggestions if you can't decide. Parking is easy as well. You can park across the street so you don't have to look for street parking.</Text>< Pictures>

We loved this place - when you're hankering for both sushi AND Peruvian cuisine- this is the place to go!  Small intimate atmosphere - great for a small gathering or casual date.  You'll get the most bang for your buck either the off-menu Bento Box special - it cones with soup and rice.  I chose sashimi, spicy tuna roll, Lona Saltado (the venerable staple) and a vegetarian potato and asparagus side dish.  I chose the Fish Soup instead of Miso soup and it was delicious.  When dinning at any Peruvian restaurant, I always sample the Alfajor for dessert - a shortbread cookie filled with very light and delectable dulce de leche.  The cookie was perfect with some coffee.< /review>

<username>melissa ulloa<//username><rating>5< /rating><Review>Ive been to both locations and love this place. The manhattan beach location is fast service and the quality is amazing. Lomo saltado and the green peruvian sauce is da bomb. We have several of their sushi rolls a cannot remember the name but also another tasty bite. plan to spend about 25-30 on the lunch special but totally worth it.< /Review>< Time>

<Text>These guys are straight 808 style locals. The shop is nice, very clean, and their work is amazing. Seymour is doing my arm and I have another session in a few weeks. Getting tapped traditional style. Can't wait to see the finished sleeve. Don't expect it to be cheap but the work they do I think the price is great.</Text>< Pictures>

I'm not really a tattoo person. But my sister recently  passed away from brain cancer.  My daughter wanted to honor her Aunt by getting a tattoo. I was so touched by that, that I wanted to get one too. We went to A-Town  randomly, mostly because it was close to find out more. Artist Hawk drew these up and we really liked them. So he did them right then and there. We are both really happy with Hawk's beautiful work and professionalism.  Their shop is clean, comfortable and friendly<//Review>

<Text>It was by far the best experience I have ever had!! Carl did the most amazing piece on my shoulder, didn't rush took his time and made sure everything looked perfect! I would definitely recommend Carl if you're looking for any detailed or realistic pieces!! The vibe there overall is awesome! Everyone is easy-going and makes sure you're completely comfortable to create the best experience for you!!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Genesis absolutely took care of me. No doubt he spent the perfect amount of time on placement and actual tattooing. I got seven symbols running up my shin for a great price. I can't speak for the rest of the shop but he was friendly and professional.
Only reason it's not a 5 star is the shop itself could use some touching up, a little cleaning, just some tlc ya know?
Overall. Very happy with my experience.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I really DON'T like this place because the guy made me play cat and mouse, while I only wanted to get snake bites, but oh no you have to go somewhere else to buy those and the that place was closed and always closed on that day and he knew it was closed too, so I just went home and looked up someone else to go. These people judge others way too fast because on the phone they said they can do it no problem.</text><gmap_id>0x80dd2871aa09000f:0xeaf711500768baae< /gmap_id>< user_id>

Pati did an amazing job.... he did the first mock up and scratched it because he said something was missing.... he took that time and scratched just because he felt it wasn't perfect ( though it looked amazing ).... he then made another mock up and was satisfied then began. I love that he took the time to do that.  He really cares to make a quality piece to fit you. Pati is personable, respectful, hospitable and extremely talented. Thank you Pati...< /Text>

Got my septum pierced here by a guy who I thought knew what he was doing. A week later with a ton of problems, I went to a professional piercer in Arizona. They told me he basically just shoved a hole in my nose, it wasn't even in the cartilage! It was quickly getting infected thanks to the terrible aftercare advice he gave me. This place was unprofessional and I would not recommend getting anything here, ESPECIALLY a piercing!<//review>

I have two questions reguarding this place . First , do you really have to be from the islands in order to get a polenisian tattoo, or can anyone get it ? Secondly ,( if yes) do you guys make original Tatau pieces for each individual?< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I went to get a tattoo by Carl this summer to bring back a memory of my Road trip during my first trip to the USA! What a job and what a wonderful welcome! I am completely fan of the result and I highly recommend this address 😍❤️

I was looking for a dentist because the dentist I had was at least I thought was a dentist that was honest and caring come to find out he was just a rip off.So I went to work searching out a new dentist a stumbled upon west coast dental everyone here so far I can say has been very professional straight forward caring and friendly. I love that Mrs.Audi. Doctor I saw made it personal she made sure my needs were met and I was completely okay.,.Dr.Audi... she saved me a lots of money when previous dentist stated I needed some that was not going to work long term offered suggestions and provided options.  So far so good you all rock West Coast Dental...my visit was amazing my mother now wants to switch offices great job team< /text>

I had to find a new dentist for a senior family member. The experience at Dental Associates of Torrance was great. I’m real big on customer service. Staff is friendly and attentive. Dr. Audi was informative and understood how to take care of a new patient that happens to be 90 years old. Thank you all for your professionalism.<//review>

<Name>shontae green< /Name><review>I had a wonderful experience during my visit. The office was clean and the staff was very nice. The x-ray technician Lizette was phenomenal. I explained to her my fears of being nervous and having gagging issues. She then assured me that everything was going to be okay. She did a wonderful job with keeping me calm and there was no gagging for the first time.< /review>< userid>

The service itself on my first visit was good, and the people I met when I was first there nice. They took X-rays and recommended a follow up procedure. However, when my insurance denied the procedure nobody at the office called me to discuss options. Worse, nearly every attempt to call and speak with someone resulted in my being placed on hold until the line would eventually disconnect my call.</Review>

My appointment was at noon but by 4:30 PM I still hadn’t seen the dentist. I waited for 4 1/2 hours and finally left because I just couldn’t take waiting anymore.

There is usually a 1 to 2 hour wait time because they do crazy overbooking.

In addition, the crown on my tooth that they put in a year ago has cracked. I’m pretty sure that they’re supposed to last longer than that.< /Review>

2nd Visit: Well I guess everything we experienced on the initial visit won’t be duplicated. Today was overwhelming. Arrived @930am for a 10am appt and wasn’t seem until 11:08am. Yep, 11:08am. While being attended to we find out we have another appointment within the office that we were NEVER told was occurring today. I have to go check-in and fill out more forms AGAIN. Made two payments when it could have been done ONCE. Today’s service...disappointing.< /Review>

Great experience with Dr. Audi. Previously had some poor dental work done, lost a filling that needed immediate attention.
Dr. Audi and staff were very kind, willing to answer questions, and caring while working with me.
Will be back!</review>

The customer service provided by the front office staff is TERRIBLE...or it couldn’t be any worse than what i’ve just experienced. They show no care or concern to the customer. They show no respect to appointment time and let it goes by with zero regard. And their attitude is not in the right place where required customer service. My appointment was at 3pm. I waited for 45min with no sign to check in. After asking the front office staff a few times to see when i would be called in, they told me there are till 2 patients ahead of me. Simple question...why scheduled my appointment at 3pm. I ended up to cancel my appointment because I wanted to waste zero time to this place.</Text>

Beyond the best experience and compassionate care ever experienced with Dental Associates of Torrance I would definitely recommend this place to family and anyone reading this review excellent and fast timely manner friendly staff and Dr. I was recommended elsewhere for braces but will definitely consider Dental Associated of Torrance for the job.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Overall I was very satisfied with the customer service and care at this dentist office. I recently changed insurance and wasn't able to keep the same dentist who I really liked. So I was a little nervous and already not looking forward to it, but the staff here were really welcoming. The dentist was friendly and professional. I also felt like the guy who did my deep cleaning- Chris- was really professional and easy to talk to, and he did an excellent job on my cleaning. When I first arrived there was someone who was unhappy because the appointments were delayed. I did have to wait an hour before I was seen, but after the good care I received I felt like it was worth the wait. I could see why they were delayed because they give exceptional care to each individual---and that takes time! There may be unexpected things that arise too so when you go to any dentist- don't be in a hurry. Thank you Dental Associates of Torrance!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

She was a little bit scared but the staff helping us were nice. Our dentist Dr. Nelda was very kind and did such a great job. My daughter made no fuss and sat patiently and I was honestly surprised. Definitely recommend and will be returning for future visits.</review>< Pics>

This office will put your call on hold for a long time to encourage you to hang up instead of them taking your call and addressing your concerns.  Unorganized when it comes to their endodontist. Canceled my sons appointment without even giving us a courtesy  call to let us know. Just so many things. Absolutely never returning.< /Review>

My kids appointment is at 1pm and they called them inside around 1:45 to do the ×-ray checkup1. They called me in at 2:15 to discuss the treatment. My son and I waited for almost 30mins before the staff came. She told me about the treatment needed, asked to sign the consent and said to me that we will schedule the cleaning and treatment on our next appointment. So for 2 hours, all they did is just an x-ray and check my kids teeth. I wish they had a better service.</review>

My first time coming here was for a simple cleaning and I waited 2 hours just to go back and get my X-rays. Then while I was back there they took another 40 minutes for to meet with me and then they would leave for 20+ minutes at a time. I waited almost 3 hours for a 10 minute cleaning during a school day. Then they asked if I wanted to wait another “40 minutes” to get some fillings. We knew it was going to take another 2 hours so we decided to leave.

I came back again a few weeks later to get my wisdom teeth removed and I had my appointment at 7:00 because they claimed I would get in immediately and I would be the first one the doctor would see. Lies! I got there at 6:45 and the doctor didn’t see me until 8:30. When he did come back he introduced himself and then left for another 25 minutes. They didn’t actually do the surgery until 9:00ish. After the surgery, they left me in the there for a long time and then barely helped me to get up and walk out to my family while I was still loopy and drugged up from the medication they gave me.

I also needed to get some fillings and they rescheduled not once, not twice, but three times. I’ve been waiting for an hour and a half in the parking lot and they just called saying that we will have to come back again in another week. My original appointment was 4 weeks ago and know it will be 5 weeks if I’m lucky! I’m a high school student and I can’t be missing school over an over because I’m waiting to get a few fillings.

When they say your appointment is at 3:00 they really mean more around 5:00 or 6:00 if you are lucky. The people who work here have no respect for peoples time, they just want your money. After I finish up with my fillings, it will be the last time I will come here. 3 strikes and you’re out! Do better Dental Associates of Torrance!!

If I could I would give them ZERO stars!</Text>

The wait time is terrible. I made an appt at 8 am but finally got to see the dentist at 9:30 am--- I could start & finish a movie during the wait time! I noticed the dentist office takes lots of ppl at the same appt time-- they really should limit the # of patients coming at the same appt time!</review>

What an amazing staff! Im normally scared of the dentist but this appointment was actually not torture for 2 wisdom teeth extractions! Woman taking my xrays was so kind and caring. Especially checking in on me from a long wait because of the xray machine was down. I am so happy the doctor waited for the best xray results before working and when he did he worked so fast and knew how to calm me down when I'm so scared at the dentist I shake for hours-Normally! But not this time! Such a great experience. Fast! Such an efficient staff and trusting process for being a procedure such as 2 wisdom teeth.</text>

Very unlikely we will return due to lack of attention given for my wife’s tooth ache. We waited almost 3 hours and all that was done was given a prescription & referred to another dentist. In the meantime she is suffering in pain throughout the weekend with a swollen jaw until we see a specialist on Wednesday. Either a root canal or an extraction could’ve solved the problem, but for now she (my wife) has to suffer. Just not right 😡< /Review>

Horrible long wait give you wrong info over the phone just so you come in. Then say that info is incorrect. And look at you like your lying. My appointment was at 2Pm Today and wasn’t seen until 3:30pm. Why schedule so many people at the same time? Makes no sense to me. People have things to do too! Front desk show no care in the world and are just sitting there staring at their screens and get bothered when you get up to ask questions! Front desk ladies were also unfriendly didn’t make you feel welcomed at all. Will Not be returning nor recommending. Oh the cherry on top which Jade me walk out was the X-ray lady was very rude, rough and seemed angry or like she hates her job! She shoved the thing for X-rays in my mouth so hard it cut me. Then yanked it out like if I wasn’t a human. Horrible horrible don’t not come here! You’ve been warned!<//Review>

Wait time is a joke. Don’t waste your time. We waited for over an hour to see the dentist for my 2 year old’s first little check up only to be told it was another 30 min wait. To expect people to wait 1.5 hours from your appointment time is not ok especially with a toddler so we left and will find another dentist. I should have listened to the other reviews.</Review>

<text>Great staff! Patty thoroughly breaks down costs and payment options, while scheduling future appointments are made easy through Melissa and the ladies in the front. Appointment reminders are texted, which are helpful.

Dr. Audi and her team of ladies in the back do a good job explaining the procedures and what needs to be done. They answer your questions and are very accommodating.

Oral Surgeon comes in twice a month, and those days seem to be the busiest.

Overall great experience—I’ve already recommended to my family.< /text><user_name>Adrian Craciun</user_name><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

It took me years to find a good dental office, up until 2 years ago I found Dental Associates of Torrance and have been pleased ever since. Their service is great, and they prioritize each and every patient based on their needs. Throughout COVID, they have gone above and beyond to maintain safety measures and protocol, which also gives me a sense of comfort knowing their #1 priority is the wellbeing of every patient. Super clean offices, and friendly workers!<//Text>

< review>
I would not recommend this office for orthodontic services. The orthodontist is only there once a week, appointments are often cancelled at the last minute by the office and it is a revolving door with different  doctors.  Appointments are difficult to obtain since the orthodontist is only there once a week. There is no continuity of care, no return calls, always mix-ups and no accountability.  Though cheaper than other offices, it is not worth the savings. Run away from this office. Fast!< /review>

Based on first impression, the dentist and dentist assistant seem to know what they’re doing.

However, the front desk receptionist is very pushy. She kept insisting on scheduling me for the actual oral surgery even after I continuously told her I first wanted to know what my insurance covered. She then proceeded to pushing on a bone implant procedure (which is unnecessary/“recommended” for the healing process) that my insurance doesn’t cover.

I don’t think I will be coming back. I only went in for a consultation because my current dentist (which I’m extremely happy with) doesn’t provide oral surgery services.</Text></record>

<Text>When I chose this dental office,I was under the impression that because it was in a good area dental care and service would be good,truly sad that it was not the case.I had called and scheduled an appointment in Feb. With Dr. Audi for treatment and scaling of my teeth,when I spoke to the female that took my call assured me that I would be scheduled Saturday with my Dr. And for the set procedures.When I got there the front desk workers did not even see me on the schedule  stating that they never scheduled me in instead it was some sort of a different call center that should not given me the schedule.so they ended squizing me in with another dentis,who actually thought was cool and funny.I believe his name was Alvaro. The manager ofcourse apologized and had me schedule my appointment for my scaling today Saturday,I thought today would be a good day since the manager scheduled my appointment, well again I checked in at 1:45 pm. And my appointment was for 2pm,and I was not brought in to the treatment room till 2:28pm then I sat there even more till I asked the dental assistant  when was Chris the hygienist come to see me,she said she would find out she came back just to tell me they had a patient ahead of me and then I'm next...At that point I'm like no this is just no good and got up from my chair the dental assistant was embarrassed  and apologized but I told her not to because ult6it us not her fault,the front desk or someone upfront is not coordinator  or allocating the correct time for each patient and procedures..They are more likely double booking to try to make there quota at the patients time....thinking it's ok to be treated like cattle.I was truly dissapointed not I went through this a second time,not sure why they wouldn't write notes on my file or somewhere so that they can see that I had gone throught disappointment last time and this time they should have prepared better..but that's not the case..I spoke with the front desk and explained,and Express my disappointment and let them know that I have been in the dental field for over9 years and that I was an RDA as well and I know what is going on and how my situation should have been handled...to there disbelief there faces changed and could not tell me anything..I will no longer go to this dental office...there not considerate of the patients time  and they do not honor your appointment time.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

X-ray tech had the personality of a rock. Then I was taken to an exam area where I then waited almost 2 hours. I got up ready to leave and told them 3 hrs was unacceptable for me to be there. My time is valuable as well. Everyone kept saying they only have 1 dr and short staffed. Not my problem. Don’t book that many appointments then. I heard other patients complain as well. The dentist asked me to give her 5 minutes. I reluctantly did. Then she wants to try to up-sale me on a crown and inlay that I don’t need. My insurance would not cover this so I would have to pay out of pocket around 2k. My appointment was supposed to be for a teeth cleaning. Spent over 3 hrs and walked out without teeth cleaning because they have to get insurance approval first. I understand this but should’ve been authorized before my appointment. So they immediately knew my insurance would not cover a crown and inlay, but don’t know if my insurance covers a teeth cleaning for what my appointment was for...?? No one looked happy to be there other than the girl at the front door checking people in. Not 1 person introduced themselves to me. Overall experience was horrible. No real customer service. If teeth cleaning is approved then I will go back there but in the meantime looking for a different dentist. Horrible experience< /Review><user>109183510299754282931</user><Rating>1< /Rating>< Name>

<Review>My appt was at 11:00. I waited 1 hour 10 minutes in waiting room then was called up and they finally decided to tell me my dr wasn’t in would I like to reschedule! I’ve now been in the back room in a dental chair waiting for 30 minutes for doctor. They just need to file a tooth. Quick procedure. They ordered me a veneer filling for a back tooth instead of the more reasonable silver filling. They talk you into doing payment plans. I feel that they try to make as much money off you as they possibly can. I’m very disappointed. I arrived at 11:00 and it’s currently 12:50 and still have not been seen. This place is not honest. Don’t waste your money and don’t let them talk you into a payment plan. Be careful. They’ll take the most expensive route they possibly can with your teeth.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Just got new insurance due to switching jobs. When I went here for the first time, Dr. Daniel Sako told me I had severe gingivitis. This was strange to me, as I've never had any indications of gum disease. I'm also 24. I heard them telling two other patients in the office that they had infected gums that needed deep cleanings. I thought something was off, but I paid for them to give me a deep cleaning and 3 antibiotics. I then went to another dentist for a second consultation, and they said I have no indications of gingivitis and not to go back there. Don't come here!! They are scammers!

Grace Ramirez in the office is also incompetent. It took her over a week to send my x rays to my new dentist. She probably knew they were going to get caught in a lie. lol. Do not recommend.< /text>

“It’s All About Customer Care”

Cons :
This dental office is the Pits. They Have been overbooking appointments for years. I have called the corporate offices and asked them to explain to me why would they allow 11 appointments to be booked at the same time 8:00am in the morning with one hygienist, and one Dentist?

The Corporate office is full of it also, for the first few years every single appointment that I have had was never serviced on time. I complained too the corporate office so much that they gave a director to note in chart and in their internal system computer system for me or my family members to be seen on time and not to be seen late.

That was 5 years ago 😏, and I have yet to be seen on time. This office usually runs 45 minutes to an hour late every appointment.

Pros:
If your wondering why I still continue treatment here it’s for a few reasons.

The first is I use to go to Smile Care and they would do the same overbooking practices.

The second is that this office in Torrance has a office manager named Zoila. Zoila is a caring, compassionate and understanding  Office Manger with her patients.

What do I mean by that? She is truthful, honest, kind and has worked out several payment plans for me and my family.

My wife & I have said  amongst each other several times, that if it wasn’t Zoila’s honesty, kindness, & flexibility that we would have left this office along time ago.

Just a simple suggestion please hire more people like her and retrain a few staff members in the front (All the way to the left as you walk in) and the (Know It All X-Ray Technician).

PS:
Chris is a great dental hygienist very detailed, informative and compassionate about his work.<//text>

<Text>These days when medical and dental care in the USA are often daunting, complex, and expensive, these doctors, advisors, hygienists, give you comfort with clear pricing, friendly attitude, care, and insurance assistance.
They are all very efficient, professional, and friendly. The staff can be a bit busy during peak hours, but they never look panicked or rushed.  I trust and recommend them for any dental advice or work.  A+!<//Text>< gmapID>

I’ve been here for over 3 hours for a simple cleaning. Currently still here at 6pm after the office is supposed to close. There was satisfaction when I scrolled down and saw an endless amount of one star reviews from other people complaining that they waited an insane amount of time as well.</Text>

< Review>
I showed up (on time) for my appointment and was ignored while I stood in the waiting room. From my view, it looked like they over-booked the early morning time slot and were under-staffed to handle the workload. There was only one receptionist working the office and she was running around trying to help people. It wasn’t her fault... I blame the staff who set up all these appointments for 8am! Disgusted with the lack of staff and over-bookings, I walked out. Not sure if I will come back to this office in the future. If I can make one suggestion... customer service is very important! Have your staff talk to your customer base when they enter the office. Assure them that they are important and that you may be busy, but you will get to them as soon as possible.  Don’t let them stand there like a ghost waiting to be helped.<//Review>

Waited for an hour and a half just to be placed in a chair and wait longer. Several patients had complained about waiting already so I decided to leave. Wish I could get that hour and half back of my life. Not professional and a waste of time. If you care about your time, I suggest not wasting it here.< /text>

Average wait time here is 2 hours like all off the other reviews say(1 in the lobby and 1 in the chair).
They are constantly trying to upsell you which is very irritating and makes them untrustworthy.
They said I needed a deep cleaning and had the receptionist explain to me before the hygienist even examined me.
I insisted I wanted the regular cleaning (free and covered by insurance) which very shockingly was around the same price as the deep cleaning</Review>

Truly aweful experience.  Pedodontist lacks ethical practices and integrity. Refused to answer questions clearly, very hostile and impatient. Refused my insurance eventhough I am supposed to go there. The den-techs were very nice. Reception nice. Overall the wait was 4 hours even with an appointmentment. I will be contacting dental board for offical complaint.</Text>

<Text>This company's primary target is more selling and more profit. I have taken my children to two different locations in 2020 and my experience at both locations was similar. They love to sell you braces, as it is $3,000 per child and probably their most profitable item. And it all starts from the moment you call the corporate office to schedule an appointment. They want you to have consultation for braces. It is this culture that trickles down from the top and all the way to the bottom. As you enter their offices, their marketing messages for braces is all over their walls, doors and everywhere. Usually behind their schedule and a lot of waiting time. I asked their front desk that our appointment was at 9am and it is past 10 now and her reply is that they are under staff. Your turn comes and the doctor's first word is, "your child needs braces". They don't even care why are you here, in the first place. This "nurse" took x-ray and it is blurry and the doctor tells me that their machine is not designed for children. I asked the doctor that why did it work on my 8 years old child that it doesn't work on 10 year old child? She was embarrassed and told the "nurse" to take another x-ray and it came all clear. She tells me that she is not a child specialist by their is some problem with tooth number (but the letter "I"). I am like what is the problem? The doctor tells me that "I think it is cavity, but the specialist will tell you." Ok...where is your specialist, I asked? Oh, she/he is not here. I asked that you knew a few days ago that a children are coming on this day then why did you wast all my time? And then she says that I should schedule another appointment. I kind of persuaded them to at least do some teeth cleaning and that is why I scheduled this appt. and after spending 2 hours all I get is that there is some problem with tooth number "I"?</Text>< Pics>

<Review>They are lacking in customer service, they are incompetent and money hungry. My niece needed braces.  We were told that phase 1 would work well for my niece.  However, they were constantly cancelling her appointments and then CoVid hit.  Once the office re-opened we were told that my niece now needs phase 2.  The NEW doctor said that if he continued on phase 1(which was recommended) she would end up with a squirrel mouth because of the crowded teeth.  Well, her teeth were crowded in phase 1.  We paid in full for something that was not completed or we should not have started.   They cannot even manage to schedule people to come in and out.  Everyone expect to spend at least 2 hours at this dentist office.  Who spends 2 hours for a basic cleaning?  They also lost my niece's file and asked us to fill out her paperwork all over again.  They also did not offer to discount the incomplete phase 1 completely from the quote of phase 2.  They were cold and uncaring about our situation.</Review>< Rate>

I wouldn’t recommend it at all. They are not organized. I had a appointment twice every time I go they say no appointment are made for you today I had appointment at 11:00Am I called they said there no appointment again which is awful but they still took me in after speaking with the doctor. Doctor seems really nice and everything but my reason today it was for cleaning basic cleaning because Im getting Invisalign braces and I made it so clear of what I want to get done and I gave them the reason why too I go there today all they did X-rays all over again and waited for the doctor she recommended couple of things which is filling, sealing, arigation. Then other lady came in I believe she’s the Financial one after quoting me everything total was around 800$ I said I’ll think about it but I would love to get the basic cleaning before i get the Invisalign braces on today. She said “oh I’m sorry unfortunately we won’t be able to do it today our next available appointment is next week on Friday” which is unbelievable. Maybe they are busy sure but they should have made it clear from the beginning instead of wasting my time. To me that’s disrespectful. Sorry I don’t now recommend this place to anyone even tho doctor seemed really nice and Brittany who helped me with the X-ray she was amazing, fast. But other than that I wouldn’t recommend it office and the front staff not really.<//review>

I got an appointment for 1:00 PM PST, checked in 5 minutes earlier. Called for xray in 10 minutes, after x-ray waited for 30 minutes for teeth gum measurement. I waited for another 2 hours until 3:30PM no one responded. I thought of asking the nurse how long it will take more to see the doctor. She has no clue what time  doctor would come and the supervisor told its their process and they don't know what time doctor will come and examine. She offered next day first appointment, unfortunately wasted three hours by taking appointment with them and not ready for another appointment...</Text>

Please call our office or email us at feedback@westcoastdental.com for immediate assistance of authorization. We also apologize you feel we are trying to "steal" from our patients. We can assure you that we are not interested in "stealing" money from any of our patients. Unfortunately, insurance companies don\'t always treat the client or the service provider fairly.  We are often told that insurance will pay a certain amount, but then the same insurance will deny payment after services have been rendered. This often leaves the patient with a large bill. We apologize for any inconvenience we have caused and hope to have a chance to make this up to you at some point in the future.'}</Resp>

Spent almost 3 hours for nothing, authorization they were supposed to submit three months earlier was never submitted not even on record! So now I have to wait another 2 months! Very disorganized , they just want your cash!! Be careful , go somewhere else unless you’re ok with mediocre dental work and are willing to give them cash or credit card.< /Text>

Had an appointment this morning one of the staff was so rude to me while asking me questions when I answer her question she talked over me. She took seated me. Told me I had to wait a hour and a half to be seen.Well that hour and 30 mins turned into 3 hours.Did I mentioned the doctor was rude as well. I will not be returning back to this dentist office.< /review>

Everyone was super helpful - Melissa provided with all my options; Chris was very patient with meme;  Dr. Amal was very friendly and made sure I was OK every step of the way; Maria did an exceptional job with my fitting and Merry walked me through the entire process so I knew what to expect for this visit. See you in 6 week weeks. Thank you so much!😊</text>< Pics>

Avoid this place at all costs. Reception is great but the dentist and her assistants are the worse. They make you feel bad when you can’t do something. Humiliating experience. Worse experience ever.</Text>

< Review>
The administration staff here are very negligent towards their duty to actually work with patients. I came in for an appointment at 11am and was seen until 12:30. Nobody said anything to me about the substantial wait and when I asked them about it, the people in the front just got an attitude. Definitely wouldn’t recommend to anyone.</Review>

The waiting time is ridiculously long, they schedule 20 patients on the same time, and there us never any apology to make you wait 2 hours to be seen
The hygienist is really good, Dr Alvarado is great
But the organization is too greedy and unorofessional
Then they charge you with things that you were were not expecting</Text>

Everyone here is so nice. I call and someone always answers the phone within a minute or two. The doctors always make sure you’re comfortable when getting treated and the staff is very clear when it comes to insurance coverage. They genuinely want to see you leave better than you came in. I drive 20 miles out of my way to get here. Love this place. Been coming for over two years.< /text>

Well, doctor comes by and tells me I have 5 cavities after waiting I don’t even know how long and leaves and says the pricing lady will come by. After waiting again, the lady comes by and just reads me a bunch of procedures that I would need and the price of it. Doctor doesn’t explain what the procedure is, why I need it and how it will help me. Nothing. This happened the last time I was here last year also. Very unprofessional and makes the patient feel like we are just a dollar amount. Why are you reading me a bunch of stuff to pay for? Without explaining anything to me?< /text>

<review>They are always backed up with patients. They need to stop double/triple booking patients. We've had to wait 2hrs just to be seen. General dentistry and ortho don't communicate with one another. We had to wait another 30mins cuz ortho didn't know where my daughter was and they took in another patient. General kept saying that ortho knew she was still with them

Update: it's not a one time occurrence, it's every time< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Overall, great patient care. Everyone in the staff is kind and professional. Their office space is kept very clean and well organized. The staff are open and clear about any proposed treatments and associated payment options of which there are many to accommodate different financial situations. Dr. Amal Audi is very good at what she does and her team makes sure that the needs of the patient are met fully and as promptly as possible. With the patient's cooperation, I don't see how anyone can leave here without feeling that they have gotten the best dental service they can get.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>always behind on appointments, not consistent with treatment plan.  my daughter had seen 3 different orthodontists there in 2 years and every time we ask how much longer she will have her braces, they respond with, a month or 2, we go to ask at that time frame, it usually is another new orthodontist who has differing opinion and gives us a different spiel.  The last time she had a check up when we were told her braces were coming off, they told her nevermind because her teeth overcorrected themselves and she was too good about using the bands.  my husband had to get irate and re-inform them on what we were told 2 doctors before.  additionally, the front admin do not follow up with insurance authorizations, do not communicate with the hygienists, or add any additional concerns/relay messages when called to add in another concern on previous treatment.  i called and tried to add another treatment fix to my upcoming appt.  The admin said they would leave a note in my profile.  They didn't even ask my name or identifying questions to look up my file to add in my request.  Also, I have left messages to ask about authorizations, I give my name and phone number and don't even get a response back.   It was 3 weeks after my initial call for me to talk to someone.  I was the one calling back asking "why haven't I heard anything".  then if I get a call back, they are not looking at who left the message or what the message was, they are asking for a totally different person.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1594154245517, 'text': "Hi, Leah.

I get very frustrated every time I enter this office. Today I had a 1:00 appointment. I wasn’t seen at all until 2:15 then had xrays which took approximately 15 mins. Then I waited and waited and waited again to see the Dentist. Spent 10 mins with him (he was very nice). Waited and waited and waited again to see the hygienist to determine cleaning. It was awful. By 4:00 — 3 hrs after my appointment I left without the cleaning — I just didn’t have any more time. Originally when I made the appointment I was told to plan to spend 1.5-2hrs. Ok, that’s what I planned for — not 3 hours!!

Also, I was told I needed a deep cleaning ($220 out of pocket) and they wouldn’t do a regular cleaning ($0 out of pocket) if I didn’t get the deep cleaning done. My previous dentist had never mentioned the need for a deep cleaning so I’m a little suspicious about that as well.

I’ll be going back to my regular dentist even though my insurance does not cover his office. I will pay out of pocket for someone I trust.<//review>

We had a great experience at this dental office! My daughter had several procedures completed in a single visit. At first, she was a reluctant and emotional patient. Dr. Dewberry and the Dental Assistant Mary were very helpful, encouraging and patient with her. Dr. Dewberry explained everything to her and worked quickly. Overall, highly recommend!</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>It is very unlikley that I will/would recommend your services. Ever since the previous doctor left the quality of the service has dropped dramatically. I brought my daughter in yesterday for a retainer repair. The nurse was extremely rude to my daughter and the attending othodonists offered no repair suggestions other than "you can get a new one if you want" she said she could not tighten or do anything with the retainer. My daughter attempted to explain that her teeth were starting to move and there is now a gap that wasnt there before. The nurse and ortho tried to tell my daughter that the gap was probably there all along. When I asked to speak with the attending orthodontist I was told she was busy with patients and was running behind schedule. All I wanted was for her to explain to me the options she gave to my 16yr old daughter. The last few visits have been horrible, so NO, unfortunately I will not be referring your services and will take my dentist and othodontist needs elsewhere.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>The ladies at the counter were great and did the best they could but honestly there was no reason for the 1.5 hour wait for a 10 minute orthodontic appointment. Called their corporate office and the girl said they were getting multiple calls about this location. They need to do a way better job of getting them techs that can make the office run smoother. The girl at corporate also said they ask them to overbook and hope that people don’t show up. The previous ortho was amazing and ran that office like clock work. This seems to be their new way of doing business.<//text>< pics>

Dr. Dewberry and his assistant Merry were both so patient with my 20 month old son today! Dr. Dewberry took the time to answer all of my questions and even made a "glove balloon" for my son to get him to open his mouth for the visual exam. A very professional team and friendly polite front office staff. Highly recommend!</Review>

I am a bonafide dental coward. I actually mentally prepare myself to go, and have my treatments, essential oils, meditation, the whole she-bang! Dr. Audi and Yolly are always so sweet, understanding, and patient with me. I have gone to them for over 15 years and I am thankful to be part of their dental family. Literally the best dentist. Thanks Guys!</Review>

I was taken care of here on my first visit. Everyone I worked with including Victor, Dr. Audi, and Yolanda were all very positive, helpful and kind in making sure I understood everything (& that the options best met my needs).

I think you'll be in good hands with them!< /Review>

My appointment was at 11am, I arrived a few minutes before and I was there for over two hours. All this time,  I only got the ex rays and a quick check by the dentist. I guess the hygienist was out, but they could have call me and told me that.
Not a very good experience on my first visit.</review>

< Review>
This place is a godsend! I am completely terrified of the dentist and this place was so gentle and made me feel like they really cared. Walking in the door, I was greeted with smiles and friendly conversation. I came in as a new patient with no insurance and they explained everything to me and had me sign up for a discount plan. The guy who did my x-rays kept making sure that I was comfortable throughout the entire process. When I got to the chair to get my work done, the next staff member that came in continued giving A+ service. Even when it came to my payment, the guy was super friendly and offered the perfect payment plan. All that to say, I’ve finally found a dental office that I plan on sticking with.<//Review>

<review>You will be waiting hours on end for a cleaning and if you're getting your teeth examines expect to waste your whole day there. Also ALWAYS ask if you are covered for any treatment they offer because they won't tell you and they are real stingy of letting you read your treatment papers that need your signature. Always check because something is crooked about this place. Look elsewhere if you can unless you want to waste a day and get ripped off so your teeth can be a bit whiter.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>So I’ll be honest back in 2017 I believe it was I hated this place when I first visited. I have no idea what happened but the last year has been awesome! The staff is friendly they talk to you and not at you. Every time I ask questions no matter how small they take their time to answer them completely and thoroughly. I thought PCH smile had the best facility and staff ... but Dental Associates of Torrance they rock too. Thank You!!!!</Review></record>

Great friendly staff I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to get my teeth taken care of if I  had known there was nice people like this out there
When you're in the situation I'm in where I have to get all my teeth taken out and get dentures it's kind of hard to go face people and let them look in your mouth and do work but they're very nice caring people<//Text>

The staff is very professional and organized. There are two waiting rooms. It’s was A/C controlled! I loved Dr. Choi and his Dental Assistant! Everything was as well as you could expect from a dentist! I had my own rom. There are some chairs near the pedestrian side of Hawthorne Blvd. It’s a fishbowl? Maybe private tinted glass?< /Review>

Tried to up sell me on stuff they even told me I didn’t need but should get just “Incase”. they kicked me out once I declined asking me to come back another to get done the same thing I had made the appointment for originally. Said I would have to wait another hour or longer to have anything done at all. 2 hours of my morning wasted. ALL THEY WANT IS MONEY. THEY TAKE THEIR SWEET TIME.

Terrible experience. Was scheduled for 4pm I  got called in at 6pm. I felt like I forced them to call me in as well. I had to complain to them every 30 minutes after waiting there for 1 hour. I felt like if I hadn’t complain about my wait they wouldn’t have ever called me in. Terrible service. I asked them if they had  skipped me and of course they denied it and claimed that the other patients that went ahead of me were old patients and that new patients had to wait for the x ray machine. Which was a lie. Never even got an apology and instead got “I don’t care what you have to say” replies . I was the last patient to leave at 7 pm. I even had arrived early to the office at 3:30pm. I seriously was in there for 3:30 hours. Never going back again.</text>

She was extremely sweet and informative and made me feel like I've been a client for 20 years even though it was my 1st visit. I had a root canal and a crown which ended up being a little more expensive than I had anticipated from the little research I did I was expecting to pay $1300 but ended up paying $1700 so I feel pricing could be better but staff and end results are phenomenal.<//text>< Pictures>

<Date>1581470510855</Date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I will never return to this place of business. I went in to get exactractions on two teeth which I did but the experience with the OS assistant and the actual oral surgeon Mr. Choop or something with a C he comes in the office every Wednesday.....The OS assistant was already coming over very rude his name was Jessie but I knew his attitude had nothing to do with me so I didn't mind it until it was time for surgery and Jessie began to aggressively hold my head down to the point I was crying because he was extremely rough and the doctor made it no better because he was being extremely rough as well while he was numbing my mouth. After the doctor extracted one tooth I needed a break because my forehead and chin was in pain due to Jessie putting so much unnecessary force on my forehead so when I asked for a break I could tell the Oral Surgeon was highly irritated and the assistant Jessie made it no better by mumbling things while he was exiting the room as if I was wrong for asking for a quick break...moral of the story please save yourself the time.....I told the front desk I wanted to have the number to corporate but I felt as though they didn't really want to give me the number. I was asked why I needed the number and I said to file a complaint and honestly when I think about it I was given a hard time about getting corporates number so I just walked out but I will be calling in today to speak to the manager because there is no way I should've been treated like that.</review>< Pictures>

Went in for a check up on a tooth that was hurting, my appointment time was at 1pm they didn’t see me till almost 3pm, still waited in back for about 30 minutes and the doctor told me I needed to fix 3 when I only went in for one. They tried to persuade me to fix all three at once so I only did two which I should have never done in the first place so I regret ever going and now I’m in debt of $1500. THANKS A LOT</Text>

Another great experience at Dental Associates of Torrance again.  Crowns, bridge, now possible periodontal work, all under one roof.  Great attentive staff.   Love this place.  Recommend this place to anyone with dentist phobias of any kind. They'll take care of you.

I was very pleased with this dental office. The staff was friendly and answered all of our questions. The office and the bathroom available to us was very clean. All three of my daughters were seen for the first time in this location and on the same day. We waited about ten minutes before they started to call our girls to the back. Although they were nervous when the arrived, they all left with big pretty smiles on their faces. Their ages are 15, 12 and 7. After my daughters  appointments, I went and made one for myself.</Review>

I used to hate going to the dentist.  Stopped going for years.  Finally came here and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.  I got a same day apt and got fillings done in that same apt.  This place is run very professionally the staff is great and makes sure that you are comfortable during your entire stay from the waiting room to the dentist chair, all your dental needs will be taken care of.  The dentist's are top notch and their assiants do a great job to.  Ask for the hot Young denist she is a pro and makes getting your teeth drilled an awesome experience.  Thanks doc I'll be back in 2 months for you to finish, I can't wait :)</Review>

<text>On the follow up visit with my son, which was two weeks after our initial visit, we waited in the waiting room for over an hour, even though we were the 7:30am appointment. After finally taking us back, and me asking multiple times what the issue was, they finally admitted to me that they didn’t have insurance authorization to perform the restorative work that needed to be done, even though it’s their policy to not confirm appointments until they DO have authorization. We took the early appointment because they don’t want you to eat for several hours before, so it’s now almost 9am, and I have a hungry boy. I honestly think they thought I should just wait around for them to get insurance approval, even though they had two weeks to get it beforehand. We won’t be going back after this poor experience.< /text>< Rating>

DR.Amal Audi is very nice super helpful and overall one of the best dentist I've seen. She is very relatable. Definitely recommend this place to everyone. Didnt wait long, was seen in a timely manner and the office manager Victor greeted us as we walked in. Staff was overall very friendly.< /Review>

<text>it always takes long as the dentist jump around and never see you on time. my husband had to get numbed 2 times because it wore off while the dentist left him to do other patients.. Basically the over book.

Then they charged him for everything in advance and when we come back for our final appt they say the did not and he has more they need to charge?

they changed the tooth that they said was now no good. He had a deep cleaning they sprayed water everywhere it was running down his back and neck he had to ask them to cover him up and if that was normal. Never had a sloppy deep cleaning like this. I will not be taking him here again.</text><resp>None<//resp><time>1559149588927< /time><pics>None< /pics><rate>1< /rate>< GmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I went to this place just to get my teeth cleaned.
They took about 20 different X-RAYs over a 45 minutes span. Then made me wait 50 minutes on a dentist chair facing a wall!!! Then finally the dentist showed up and proceeded to list for me all the procedures I needed to have done even as I told her ALL I WOULD EVER DO WAS A TEETH CLEANING. She ignored me and sent in some assistant who proceeded to repeat to me the litany of the procedures I needed to have at which time, I got so f.....g frustrated I got out of my chair and left. It seems this place is only interested in making money through any means!!!
I would NEVER EVER recommend it or return there.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2b4d3160dc99b:0xc9bc7a0be1a31a91</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have to share that my experience here at Dental Associates of Torrance has been wonderful. I need people to know that the care,kindness and quality of dental work that is done is amazing. They treat you like a real human being. And as you have noticed the world has not been to kind to one another these last years. I really want to thank,appreciate and respect Mr. Chris my hygeinist for all his hard work,patience,kindness,tenderness,being very professional aswell as educating me with answers I can understand and better take care of my teeth. I also have been futher blessed with Dr. Dewberry who is just as gentle on my mouth,educates me and gives great metaphors so I can understand. I have a chronic medical condition and he was very understanding. Kuddos to all the ladies that are a ray of sunshine and very helpful by calling for my ride or seeing how they can get my appointments in all together since I am there. I all want to acknowledge Victor the manger who apparently is making sure things run smooth.
I also must acknowledge (please forgive mijo the names are getting scrammbled)
I think his name is Jose or Xavier. He is the sweetest young man . He assist Mr.Chris and Dr. Dewberry he makes sure I get a blanket because I get really cold. Please give these people a raise and treat them right, I say that to you corporate office. This staff is amazing. It takes alot to impress me. But I take it very seriously the way human beings get treated. So there is one final kuddos that is to you corporate office because there is an old saying 'The Fish Stinks From The Head Up!" In this case you being the head are to be congratulated that Dental Associates of Torrance does not Stink.
It is the opposite it smells like roses. So take care of the roses. Thank you very much.
Respectfully,

Entrance could look more welcoming also   When I  called earlier that morning I told the front office I had a toothache. Last time I was there  2015  returned 2019 and  they still  leave you waiting a longtime  I don't understand why I was there 4 hours all they did was a Pano, X-ray's and exam also  hygienist did perio ck up. I hope my future appts are not so long. 🤔< /Text>

<review>DO NOT GO HERE!!! I WAS LIED TO!! I went in for a cavity and a cleaning (never got the cleaning), and was told that I had no other choice but to get the most expensive filling they had. Come to find out from my insurance that I had other options. And the four hundred dollar filling I got (which they said would last over two decades) fell out a year later!! I emailed them with my frustrations and never heard back. Then I called and was told they would call me back. Never got a call back. Then I called again the next day and waited for an hour and a half on hold. When I finally got someone on the phone telling me that I was responsible for my filling falling out. They are shady and only in it for the money! They don't care about you!< /review>< Pics>

<text>The quality of service is great. The people here are professional and are very willing to explain costs and services. My only issue is the inconsistencies in wait times when compared the appointment times.  I am very lucky and thankful to have a job that is willing to give me time to get teeth worked on, but there are many people out who don’t have that luxury. Spending 3 hours here for a teeth cleaning isn’t a massive inconvenience, but it is a bit much in my opinion. My first visit, there was a woman laying down on the table asking if someone was going to come finish her oral work, as if someone had left her mid varnish application or something.</text>< time>

<Review>I went one busy Saturday, I saw a Dr. Mazloom, who was only filling in but I found Dr. to be a kind, courteous doctor, he could have told me I needed 2 crowns like I'm used to hearing dentists tell me, but he said I only needed 1 Inlay. (More than a filling, but less than a crown). And only a filling. They were very busy today. Saturday, but good enough to squeeze me in as a new patient, as I was having toothaches. They accommodated  me without waiting for my insurance to designate them, I avoided having to wait til Oct 1. Dentist was very conscientious of my needs and that I was always comfortable. The next Saturday I saw regular Dr. On Saturdays, Dr. Cardenas. He was also very kind and courteous to my needs. The only thing I really had a problem with was I arrived 11 am and I was not done, after xrays. Inlay and polishing until 4pm. I was very hungry, no lunch, hard for a diabetic like me. But I will know to bring more than the 2 snacks I had brought and ate by noon.😊

Well I just saw Dr. Audi today, Wednesday for 1st time. She just checked my mouth and told me I need 2 more teeth worked on. She didnt even take xray. She just told me she could do it today. I was only planning on having done what 1st dr said, and she added new treatment plan, didnt even tell me what had to be done. Just needed to complete a certain quota seemed like. I dont think I'll be back.<//Review><user_id>115604522095271048854</user_id><GmapID>0x80c2b4d3160dc99b:0xc9bc7a0be1a31a91<//GmapID><Rating>4<//Rating><name>Grace Thomas</name>< resp>

First I paid $1000 2 times to get my tooth caped and the damn thing came right off in less than a year.  They act like that was supposed to happen.  My son has had his braces in his mouth for 6 years because their orthodontist barely come in.  He is only scheduled for twice a week but may or may not make it once.  My sons teeth moved because we waited 3 months for a retainer because again the ortho doesn't work much.  My sons braces are off today and I'm done with Dental associates of Torrance<//text>

I am 28 and have only been to a regular dentist 3 times in my life due to neglectful dad/step-mom, and then my own anxiety over doctors as an adult.

This dental office was compassionate, kind, extremely observant to my needs and made sure to talk me through the harder parts of my dental work. I was shown how to floss and brush properly, and was not shamed for being neglectful of my teeth in the past. I was educated on how to go forward, and had fun learning while getting my teeth fixed.

I had a total of 8 cavities done, antibacterial work for mid level gum disease, and a full mouth four quadrants of scaling and deep clean. They accomplished everything in under 5 hours, and I left feeling satisfied with the cost, customer service and the quality of technical work they did on my teeth.
Dr. Audi, Asst. Yolly, my dental hygienist (I’m sorry, I do not remember his name), and all of the finance and front desk staff were absolutely wonderful to me.

I will always recommend them and Dental Associates of Torrance to anyone who asks for a dentist! Five stars, and my deep gratitude!<//Text>

<date>1454516962480< /date><Rating>2<//Rating><text>The wait is usually hours long. There is always a dental emergency ahead of us or some other issue. My sons and I have never once, in all the years I've been going here, been seen timely. We joke that we should just show up an hour late and skip most of the waiting. Another example of issues is that I've waited years with multiple appointments to have some periodontal work done. There is always some issue or someone forgot. One son is only 20. His cavity was filled at DAT. Sure enough, they found another cavity underneath the filling of the cavity they just did and charged us for the work.

But... they take our insurance so we really don't have a lot of choice.<//text>< pictures>

<review>This place is a SCAM! After reading through the reviews here and combining people's experience similar to mine, I can confirmly say that this place ONLY CARES ABOUT YOUR MONEY AND NOT YOUR TEETH/HEALTH!
I went to this location for a simple dental exam and ended up coming out with a guilt feeling. After taking my xrays, their "health associate" or whatever they call (was a female) it came up to me with the lists of many UNUSUAL things/procedures that my teeth needed with an UNUSUAL COSTS!!.... And I try take care really good care of my teeth, but this was insane! So I left the crazy place and went to another much honest better quality/rating dental place and the people were SURPRISED how Dental Associates of Torrance treated me! As only needed, got my dental exam done and cleaning done and day was better👍!
(p.s Heads up about this place)</review>< user>

First time at this office.  I have Medicare, Medicare covers x-rays cleanings.  I was shocked at the cost to rectify my dental issues, and the inflexibility of the staff/doctors to work with me.  I was told i need a deep cleaning, to the tune of $160.00.  it has only been 2 years since my last cleaning.  I scheduled the appt. to have this done.....reality, i don't have the money. I called to let the office know i just can't afford to have the deep cleaning, could I schedule a regular cleaning.  I was told "No".  The Doctor diagnosed a need for deep cleaning.  Done!  no discussion, no devising a plan of action.  I was told to call back when i can have the deep cleaning.  Has dentistry become an up-selling business?  I am very disappointed.  Shame on this business for milking the system put in place to help people.  Where did the humanity go?  Not here.  Go Go very far from here.< /Review>

This a horrible place that is full of dishonest people.They told me that I cannot get my fillings until I get deep cleaning .the women in front desk told me that deep cleaning costs 570$  in cash,after negotiating I paid 500$ , I decided to get the cleaning because they told me filling is impossible without cleaning.I went to the next appointment to get cleaning and filling after.but, I discovered that they made the fillings before cleaning that was not necessary.the I told the girl on front desk that i had paid for cleaning but I didn’t get it so she took me inside again while I’m waiting for the hygienist I heard that they were offering 470$ for deep cleaning to another patient .I was shocked to know that< /review>

The staff are friendly but they are a con! Took 2 hours to see the doctor, they recommended deep cleaning for $550. When I said I would not like to do it at this time but would like a regular cleaning they said I still had to pay $300 because it's not covered by insurance. Liar! My insurance does cover general cleaning. So after waiting 2 hours, I left without the cleaning that I came in for. Waste of time. They won't perform any services unless they can get more money out of you. Scam!< /review>

This is my second time here and I will never come here again. They have no clue on customer service and over book their clients each time.
We waited over 2.5 hours for just cleaning and didn’t perform any work. Ruined our Saturday.

<review>After dealing with the dental office assigned to me by my insurance, I was extremely happy that I came to this dental office. My drive went from  a short 4 minute drive to a 40 minute drive, in regular traffic, but it was well worth it. The other office did not care about the pain I was in. That can't be farther from the truth here. I have very sensitive teeth and they always make sure I am fully numb. I admit I am a baby when it comes to dental work. They are so warm, yet profesional and always tell me up front what my coats are and give me options for treatment and payment. I highly recommend coming to this office. Dr. Audi is very kind and professional. She did abreast job on my bridge. Yolly was very patient and put up with so much from me.  All the staff is great.<//review>< pictures>

Horrible place.They kept me waiting and suggested many unwanted treatments Basic tooth cleaning which could have been done as it’s covered by my insurance but they only insisted to do deep leaning immediately.Not concerned for patients but only interested in extracting money<//Text>

<Review>Communication is not too good.
Was told specialty doctor was leaving early, this was another consultation today, when I got there he asked if I was ready for root canal? ( If I would have known I would have scheduled a sitter). So had to reschedule!<//Review>< Rating>

<text>First off it was a bad impression my son went in to have a bad tooth pulled and came out owing $2,500 through Dental Alliance, my son has a learning disability and they just pushed him through all of it. Never did pull his tooth. We're now receiving a bill for $71 which includes the 28.48% interest rate. We went in today to out and end to this. An hour and 15 minutes went by and we were now told that we still had to pay $600 for The Impressions that were made but they would refund us the other money. I had to do a lot of rraising my voice, demanding and standing up for the situation refusing to accept it and in the end, the wonderful regional manager "Christina" did the right thing and zeroed out the charges.  Also, the Dentist, can't remember how to spell her name she was absolutely wonderful too!
I am now planning on going in to have work done on my mouth.</text><user_name>Sherrie Kinzey< /user_name><Resp>None< /Resp><rating>5<//rating><userid>117485145004133084845<//userid>< pictures>

<Text>I have been going to them since a child but lately I have had horrible experiences with them. They have been rude, insulting me more than once and refused to give me access to my dental records. After I requested them for the 3rd time I was told they were destroyed and they only have digital copies going back to 5 years. Not to mention... last time I went and had dental work done they gave me something I was allergic to and refused to give me the name of that drug. They don't value their customers they are just money hungry!!!</Text>< pictures>

I was scheduled for a Deep Cleaning appointment two months in advance. I have two jobs and a family therefore arranging a day off for this appointment was very complicated but I managed it. The day before my appointment in the late afternoon a message was left on my home phone (opposed to my work or cell number) stating my appointment had been cancelled and I needed to call and reschedule. I contacted Gina (Supervisor) and Gina advised me that my appointment was cancelled because their records showed that I needed another exam prior to proceeding with the final of my four Dental Cleanings. Gina stated that an exam is required every 6 months, however my third cleaning was after the 6 month requirement and I was never advised. I ask Gina since my appointment was at 11am if I could come in prior to that time for the exam. Gina very rudely said "no it has already been cancelled &  she would reschedule me for then end of the following month" this was not acceptable since I was not informed of their policy for exams and my appointment was cancelled prior to leaving me the message within 24 hours of my appointment time. Gina's reply and solution was "Lady since this appears to not be working for you I am going to contact your Insurance Company and send a fax to them removing you from our patient log and you can then go elsewhere".  I was in shock during the entire conversation. This was unprofessional, un-concerned and rude. Gina did not accept any responsibility in this matter.  When I first joined Dental Associates of Torrance it was based upon a referral and it was great however the customer service is now awful. This is the second time an appointment was cancelled the first time my appointment was on a Saturday and I was advised that policy had changed and only certain type of appointments were allowed to be scheduled on a Saturday. (I re-arranged a vacation to keep this appointment-that was cancelled within 24 hours of my scheduled appointment)   I was advised of the change in customer service by others who have left Dental Associates of Torrance  but I assumed their story's were exaggerated.  Dental Associates of Torrance should realize that people with insurance have a choice and their employees are paid by those choices.<//review>

The wait was over an hour long, but once I was called in the staff couldn't have been more pleasant.  The doctor just came in with no introduction and told me to open my mouth. He gave me options and left. I asked the tech was that the. Dr and she said yes so I told her I wasn't sure since he said nothing but to open my mouth.  She said they were really busy so I guess he was rushed.  I'd come back because everyone has a bad day. The facility seem very clean and bright. The staff from the front desk to the back were pleasant.< /Review>

First off. I made my appointment for Friday April 27th, 2018 for 2:00pm. DA of Torrance text me a day before my appt to confirm my appt. and they call me to call back to confirm. I called DA of Torrance back to confirm and she said that my appointment is for 3pm and i said no i made it for 2pm. I have proof from the text and voicemail they sent me. So she said she will change it. Werid!
When i arrived for my appointment i had to wait 45mins to take X-rays. Then waited in the waiting room for a chair to open up. After a hour and 40 mins from the time i arrived i was sent to an open station. I was seen by a male nurse to measured my gums. He was nice and very clear on what he was doing with me and what i had.
After two hours and thirty mins from the time i arrived i saw the dentists. She only came to tell me what she suggest i needed. She was with me for a about 10mins.
Then i had to wait for another lady to tell me how much it will cost me. I informed her i have two insurance. One I’m on my husband and one i have from myself. So she said she will have her girls to call me back on the prices on Monday.
At that point, I’ve been at the DA OF Torrance for 3 hours and 30 mins without getting any cleaning or anything fix.
I feel like i wasted my time. To top it all off i was scared the whole week because I’m afraid of the dentists.
Over all the staff is nice but didn’t keep me inform how long it was going to take.
I will not return or give Dental Associate of Torrance my business.
Thank you.</text>

I was quite apprehensive not being sure the goal of having a heslthy mouth ahain was wirth the imagined pain. I normally am not very determind to do what is the right thing. Anyway the technicians and staff help me be brave enough.Congenial, encouraging words from those involved made me feel safe and alright. So thank you ( My memory of names isn't good) I really appreciate your professional methodology? Thank you all.</text>

Seen Dr wynn on 7-3-17, i don't know if it is the correct spelling of her name, anyway  it took her for ever to pull my tooth, made my mouth real sore, she knocked off my crown from the tooth next to the one she pulled they put that back on, now that tooth is hurting real bad, she cut the side of my mouth putting in the stitches, OMG!!! the other dentist Dr audi told me to give it 2 more weeks and it should be healed and feeling better. I will see. Not holding out much hope. Bad experience for me. I hope yours is better.

Shady ethics and questionable business practices:

A month before oral surgery, I received a request for additional information on the procedure planned from my insurance. I called the office and asked about it, and they said they would handle it. Instead, they waited until the day OF the procedure to send the additional information out by regular post mail, thus forcing me to pay out of pocket for the procedure.

It's been a month since the procedure took place and I've called several times to follow up on the process of my claim and coverage reimbursement, but so far I've left 3 messages and received no updates. Very unprofessional and outright shady practice for them to have pulled this kind of move. Find an office with better ethics and business practices.</review>

< Review>
Everyone is nice and friendly, they make you feel welcome. And I believe the floor manager by the name of Carlos Espados really nice and freindly.also the two tech Liasa Make And Sonia santillan makes you confertable and the are kind. Most of all Dr. AMAL AUDI a wonderful person and verey very freindly and she listened when you talk to her. But a week after when I went the 2nd time on July 3rd 2017 there was anoother substitue female dr. with sun glasses  doesnt want to hear what I was saying. Before she talked to me she just wrote prescripition which I refused to take and left the clinic. If I know her name defenately I.....Plus if i know someone who want to go to your clinic I will tell him not to see her< /Review>

Had to wait 4hrs, made appointment weeks in advance.  What is the point of making a reservations when you have to wait 4 hrs!!!  They need to learn how to schedule patients, very rude, not even sorry for making our whole family wait without any updates, gonna change offices.  I would never recommend this office to anyone!!!</Text>

<text>Not impressed , arrived at 3:40 , filled out the forms , they called my daughter back , after waiting hour I texted her , she responded , “they haven’t done my cleaning  yet , “ I asked to go back with her , they took me back , we waited 25 min more before my face must have scared them 😩finally a girl came and said are you still waiting , let’s see , ok you are next for cleaning , then they said no cleaning she needs deep cleaning and they need approval . Then she gave me the prices for crown , not cheaper then my Dentist  on the hill , This place feels like assembly line . Two and half hours wasted !!! When I asked for the X-ray she said she could only give me a paper copy , so like I said waste of time !!! Unless you have no choice ,( they take Medical )<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2b4d3160dc99b:0xc9bc7a0be1a31a91</gmap_id>< time>

Awful  experience they take forever! They need to be sued!  I got 3 root canals and overcharged for everything when I asked them for my copies this other girl who isn't the reception gave me print out of what is not the files or the x-ray before my root canal  was done. I think they are covering up for something but now I'm going get a lawyer< /Text>
