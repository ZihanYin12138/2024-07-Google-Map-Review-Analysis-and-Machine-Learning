<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Let's be honest: waxing the lady parts is never a "pleasant" experience. But I've been to quite a few different waxing places and this waxing method is definitely different in the best way possible!

I've been going to Jenny and not only is she super gentle but she's also really funny and easy to talk to. She makes me feel super comfortable! I buy the student pass (buy 3 get one free) and it's such a great deal.

I had never gotten a Brazilian wax before but wanted to give it a shot. I looked at a lot of different places on Yelp and decided to go with Carla.
It was a wonderful experience and I just made my second appointment! I would definitely recommend Carla for all your waxing needs - she was fabulous!!!< /Text>

This was my first Brazilian wax and it definitely won't be my last. Carla walked me through the process and made me feel at ease every step of the way. She is such a sweetheart and has the ability to make you feel really comfortable. I will recommend Carla to all my girlfriends because I'd want them to have the same pleasant experience that I had!!!<//Review>

I've gone ahead and discarded any that are visible old/stained. All the towels, linens, robes, and headbands are washed with hot water and bleach so no worries on cleanliness.  Many of the enzymes stains are hard to remove. We'll work with the esthetician(s) to remedy the issues you mentioned and avoid in future. We invite you to come back in the future to have a better experience. Have a great day!"}<//resp>

General feeling of dirtiness - robe had weird spots on it, hair band was so old that it was grey and the Velcro didn’t stick. Instead of getting a new one, the aesthetician just removed it. General incompetence during the procedure as well - didn’t seem like she knew how to use the tool, scratched up my face. Every step felt uncomfortable and awkward. Avoid this place.<//review>< time>

<Review>I went to get my eyebrows done here last August before my wedding and I had a fantastic experience. The location is beautiful and the facilities are great- very calming and peaceful. Erika did a fantastic job on my eyebrows, interpreted what I had said and made recommendations for a brow shape that better suited my face. Overall, I was very impressed! I also reviewed a friend to Erika for a facial and she had rave reviews. Can't wait to go back for more!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The gal who helped me was very professional, and explained everything she was doing.
It was an hour appointment, a 90 minute appointment might have been better, it seemed to pass so quickly. The table is heated which was a nice benefit. It was a little tricky to book an appointment which was about 3 weeks out.
I would recommend Skincare by Erika.< /Text><GmapID>0x808f7fcb00000001:0x473999a8079f3e7e</GmapID>< rate>

<Text>I originally came here with a Groupon for a facial and liked it so much I bought a package. Everyone here is very knowledgeable and friendly. I also really liked the products they used, especially since they were natural. They don't try to push their products on you though I did end up getting a couple because I saw good results. Would recommend!<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>I usually go here for Brazilian waxes but have done a couple of their facials. All their estheticians are friendly and do a fantastic job. I find that they spend a little extra time plucking the little hairs that the wax missed, which I appreciate as some of the other places I have gone to don't pay as much attention to the details. They offer you tea the moment you step in and appointments always start on time. They are efficient and do a fantastic job consistently.<//Text><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Anyone who is looking for a good and clean Brazilian wax this is the place to go. Before I came to skincare by Erika I had gone to many other wax places but this has been the only places that's kept me coming. The place is clean and really welcoming. I've had the pleasure of working with Ariel and Erika they make sure they clean everything. Really love the hard wax and it way less painful than soft wax. This is what keeps me coming.< /Review>< UserId.>

Waxing services are great! I've been going here for over a year after purchasing a Gilt City deal. They use great products and all the estheticians I've had have executed quick and relatively painless services. Everyone is so nice and getting an appointment is always a breeze. I love that they offer package deals at a slight discount. Always very clean and playing soothing music. Glad I found this place!</review>

<Text>Getting a facial at Skincare by Erika is always a treat. It's relaxing, the products are plant based and smell great, the rooms are a nice size and the staff is wonderful. The Deluxe Micro & Peel Facial, with an enzyme-based peel, is a treat for your skin. You will leave feeling refreshed and happy with how you look. As about getting sets of 5 in a discount package and go every 45-60 days, then see and feel the difference.<//Text>< Date>

<text>Went here when I got a living social or group on voucher about a year ago. Had a great experience and went back several times. Very cute and clean facility, nice ladies working in there. I just don't go there anymore because the girl doing my Brazilians said I could cut back to every 8 weeks, but didn't tell me that would mean a higher price per session. Overall though, I would still recommend them to others.</text>< Date>

I received a group deal, which made it a very reasonable price. However, it was not very easy for me to book an appointment and the waiting time was a bit long. But on the other hand, the service was quite nice. I was quite satisfied.< /review>

Best facial in town!  I have been coming to Skincare by Erika for over 2 years now for a facial, microdermabrasion, and eyebrow tint package and I would recommend Erika to everyone.  My skin always looks fabulous after my visits and it is always a pleasant relaxing experience.  Erika takes her time and makes sure each treatment is perfect.  Can't wait for my next visit!< /review>

Skincare by Erika is a top notch Facial and waxing spa.  I had a great facial there and a brazilian wax.  They use a high quality blue wax which doesn't require cloth and so it is a more comfortable experience.  The young lady who helped me with both treatments was lovely and thorough.  I highly recommend this Spa.</Text>

While I appreciated the information given, there wasn't time to just relax into the treatment, which is one of the main reasons for getting a facial.

Ria did such a great job on me, while my face was being taken care of she went the extra mile and gave me a hand massage which was much better than what I get at my nail salon.  I left feeling rejuvenated looking and feeling younger. I would recommend them to anyone . even if you've never had a facial this would be a great place. I've mentioned it to my customers and co-workers as a great rejuvenation. Great downtown location. This would make a great Christmas gift.< /review>

<Text>Any type of wax you get will be as great of an experience a wax can be.  They are efficient, thorough, and most importantly, extremely clean.

I have gotten a product from them (PFB Vanish - it works), but I've never felt like I was being pushed to buy anything. The office is also clean, centrally located, and I've never had to wait past my appointment time.

I've been seeing Ariel lately and she's fantastic - really thorough, and she actually makes the whole experience pleasant, which is not easy to do!<//Text>< user_id>

I came here on a groupon, and have now become a regular client. Erika and her staff are amazing. So friendly and explain everything. I never knew there were different kinds of wax and the hard wax they use is way less painful then soft wax. I have had my bikini and underarms done there, each time was perfect. They also offer really good deals for first time clients and when you buy packages.< /text>

< Review>
I've had a couple of treatments at Skincare by Erika.  I've had a microdermabrasion and Erika was great.  Really thorough in her assessment of my skin.  My favorite treatment though, has to be my spray tan.  It was fast and the color was incredible and lasted for a few weeks.  The woman (and I'm so sorry I can't remember her name) was incredibly professional and made me feel very comfortable. I purchased their package, because this will be the only way I tan now.  Helpful note, they do late appointments.  If you drive, schedule shortly after six, that's when all the meters change downtown so parking was a breeze!<//Review>

<text>Going to Skincare by Erika is the best treat I give myself.  I drift off into another world and an hour later I am shinny like a mirror and feeling rejuvenated.  I always buy the package so as to get more facials for my money and it is the best investment in me !!!!< /text>< Gmap_id>

It was my first waxing and they were very nice and the place was very clean.  It was a pleasant experience and they even do a free clean up within a week of your appointment.  I definitely would come back again!< /text>

<Review>I thought my facial with dermabrasion and enzyme peel was just okay. They try to up sell you several times during the treatment and have signs posted with even more ads for products and additional services. It's more of a clinical experience as opposed to a relaxing/tranquil experience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just don't expect to feel super soothed and relaxed at the end.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>I think this place is phenomenal. Great service, good prices, and fantastic estheticians. I bought a deal online and have been coming here ever since. They also send out deals by email that I always take advantage of, and which make me feel like a valued customer. Highly recommend!<//Review><GmapID>0x808f7fcb00000001:0x473999a8079f3e7e</GmapID>< pics>

<review>Friendly staff and great results. I got a bikini wax and subtle spray tan before my wedding in February and was very happy with them both after I left. No red bumpiness from the wax and the spray tan was natural looking and faded really well. Would've rated 5 stars but the waxing seemed a little haphazard and was more painful than other places I've tried. The results were great, but the process was long and less efficient than some other girls I've had. Overall, a good experience though!< /review>< Date>

I had a wonderful experience, I walked out of there like a newer, brighter person...
From the moment I came in, from the timely appointment, from the sooth music and erica telling me everything she was doing, what products she was using and what it's doing to my face.. I felt like I could trust her. She really knows what she's talking about, the products are a bit pricey but it's because it works! I'd highly recommend checking this place out, everyone here was wonderful and very warm welcoming.<//review>

I wanted to give an update on this spot - I have been coming here consistently since I made my return visit in 2014. My skin has never looked better since I started getting facials here (about once every quarter or more).

The secret is to get a facial package which, while painful to pay for up front, gives you an insane deal on the price of your facials overall. They are good for a year and I think you get 5 in a package.

So worth it if you are looking to make this a semi-regular part of your routine. I have recommended this place to all of my friends and will continue to do so!< /Text>

Got a Groupon years ago and never stopped coming - this has been my favorite place to get facials and Brazilians hands down. I've had really acne-prone skin my whole life and I needed to find something that would really work for me; they take care of you and make sure you have the right treatment for your skin. The staff is lovely and they are very meticulous. Also their products are really amazing, they've helped my skin so much. Also they made me never wanna do my own eyebrows again cause now I just go there!< /Text>

I've been to quite a few places to get Brazillians, and Skincare by Erika is hands down the cleanest place I've been with the most professional people. I highly recommend coming here for waxing. Not only was it not painful (I didn't have to pop a pill beforehand), but the waxing came out great---did not have growth 3 days later.<//review>

I got a spray tan with a living social deal and was very happy with the result. I wanted a subtle glow for an upcoming trip and that is precisely what I got. It was quick, easy, and everyone I interacted with was helpful and had a great attitude. I would go back, even without a living social deal.</review>

Skincare by Erika offered a Living Social special, but I would've gladly paid full price for the professional, kind and indulgent facial experience I received there by a real pro! Rather than sell products through the facial session, the room was quiet and I was allowed to drift into oblivion. Very pleasant for sure.<//Text>

I absolutely love this clinic, Ariel helped me with my services and allowed me to extend my facial credits a bit longer due to my overseas traveling.  Not to mention they're customer service is outstanding but their facials are the best…left my skin glowing and refreshed.  I do miss this clinic and wish i wasn't so far!<//text>

I came here for an emergency wax when I was visiting SF. They were professional, attentive and adept. Waxing is never really a pleasant experience, but I left there with nothing but good thoughts. The wax was virtually painless and done quickly, which is all I ask for. When I eventually move back to SF, I will definitely be returning.<//review>

I discovered this place on Groupon and had a great experience. The place was very clean and they used great products. The wax was similar to sugaring but much cheaper and fairly painless. My esthetician was very professional and welcoming. I've recommended this place to others and would definitely come back. Location is also prime!</Review>

<review>had a groupon and it was easy to make an appointment. facial itself was great, along with the suggestions. there was the expected pushing of product, but i felt that it was genuine in regards to better skincare.< /review><GmapID>0x808f7fcb00000001:0x473999a8079f3e7e</GmapID>< username>

The atmosphere is calming and the providers seem knowledgable. I appreciate that they gave me a spiel about products that would work for my skin type after my facial, but that there was no pressure to buy. It's not upscale, but my face was soft and fresh when I left.< /text>

I had a great experience at Skincare By Erika. I bought a Groupon for a facial, and Ariel was really great. She addressed my problem areas and really helped get my skin under control by addressing underlying issues. They also use great products.<//Text>

I had my first facial and microdermabrasion treatment at Skincare By Erika and I loved it!  Erika is very friendly and can explain everything that you ask about. The whole experience was very relaxing, informative, and helpful - it has helped me start loving my skin again and I feel like I have finally started on the path to actually healing my skin problems. Thank you Erika!</review>

I bought a groupon for a signature sfacial In Jan 2016 and loved the experience. I had never been a client before, but the facial was a perfect mix of relaxing for my mind and reinvigorating for my face. I was eager to buy one of the products she used ( a yummy pumpkin scrub) but I was never pushed into the purchase.</text>

<review>I really liked my brazillian and armpit wax at Erika.  I got a groupon deal and it was extremely easy to book the appointment.  I work in the south bay, so I don't get back to the city until later, but they always have appointments that suit my schedule.  The ladies there are super warm and helpful.  And they are always offering deals and packages.  I would definitely go back once I'm back from work travel.</review><user_name>Vicky Tian< /user_name><Response>None</Response><rating>4<//rating><UserId.>107981760379837773413<//UserId.><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Gmap_id>0x808f7fcb00000001:0x473999a8079f3e7e< /Gmap_id>< Date>

Got a Brazilian and under arm wax by Ria. Painless!!!! She was very informative and friendly. I pre-purchased a facial and can't wait for it. I love the emails I get from them with coupons and specials, because they can be a bit pricey. But service is great! No complaints.<//review>

<review>I've been here several times and typically have a great experience albeit the traffic from union square.... but this time, I was a bit disappointed.
The mask that was used started to burn my skin and they immediately took it off, however, they didn't have another sensitive skin mask to put on. Isn't that one of the most important parts of the facial? My skin looked great afterwards but I feel like that I was short changed by not having an alternative to the mask portion.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I came here with a Groupon and will definitely come back if I can get another one. I was pleasantly surprised how fancy it was based on the price I was paying for a facial. The place was completely empty, so I felt a little awkward. But all in all, I had a pleasant experience and a pretty good facial. I have tough skin, so I don't get many facials. In the end I'm glad I got one here.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

<Review>I am always scared to try facial treatment because of my sensitive skin. Me and my husband decided to try facial treatment for our anniversary presents for each other. I found Skincare By Erika from Groupon. I called to make an appointment, and I was really surprised how nice they were. They really were very accommodating for the date and time I was looking for. The facial was really a great experience, especially because they really paid so much attention about my sensitive skin and facial redness. I loved the smell of all the skin products that they used. In addition, Erika and all the other aesthetician were nice and friendly. My husband and I decided to get each a facial treatment package to continuously pamper and take care of our skin since we found a great place like Skincare By Erika.<//Review></record>

I used a Groupon for a facial. Scheduling an appointment was easy and no-frills - everything was done online.

The spa ambiance was quite basic - don't expect Burke Williams, but everything was clean and tidy.

My facialist was very friendly and was very knowledgeable about skincare. So much so that she sold me on an additional eye treatment!

I met Erika and she explained their special packages, but I didn't feel pressured to purchase.

All in all it was a positive experience.<//review>

I was lucky to find Skincare By Erika on Groupon about two years ago.  I couldn't be happier with the services provided, the professionalism of the staff and the products used.  I have a microderm abrasion and peel every couple months and I use the product regimen recommended - I know my skin looks healthier and YOUNGER.
I highly would highly recommend Skincare by Erika to to anyone looking for excellent skin care.<//Review>

I have had the most incredible results since I have been coming to Skincare by Erika.  I  stumbled upon this wonderful place by buying a Groupon for a facial and micro-dermabrasion.  I have oily, sensitive skin with fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  After the first treatment, I was amazed at the results.  I now go for a facial every 6 weeks and I use the skincare regimen they recommended.  My skin has NEVER looked better.  My pores are smaller, my skin is smooth.  My acne is non existent.  Even my deeper creases on my face have improved.  Erika is very knowledgeable and a great business owner.  When I called asking about one of the products they recommended and my reaction to it.  Erika had me come in to evaluate and gave me a free treatment to resolve the issue.  I have had many facials in the past, but this is by far the best experience I have ever had and the results are remarkable.  I will be a life long customer.< /Text>

<text>The facial experience was average if not slightly above average.  They have their own line of skincare products that they use.  The esthetician's technique was ok, not as thorough with extractions or smooth with the application of products as facials that I have gotten in past at other places.  I wish he gave me individualized suggestions and advice on my skincare regimen and products instead of vague responses.  I don't have anything bad to say but I don't have anything great to say about the facial which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.< /text><time>1469404213068< /time><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

I went here because it was recommended and I saw a Groupon deal. I got the deep pore cleaning facial and it was okay. The aesthetician could have done a better job cleaning my pores. Some of the pores were left half clean and turned into pimples. It was a 60 minute facial but she spent 40 minutes on my face. On the plus side, its a clean facility, she gave me shoulder massages while my masks were drying and was friendly over all.</review>

Friendly, professional and clean. Reasonable prices, especially if you get a package, and they send out deals frequently to the email list. The estheticians really push their line of products and additional services, which can feel a little awkward, but I do like that they explain each step of what they're doing and what issues they are trying to address with the specific products they're using.<//review>

I went to Skincare by Erika with a Groupon for a brazilian wax. I had a great experience - the wax was painless, easy, fast, and good quality. The only reason I give four stars rather than five is that I thought the team tried to push me too much to buy some of their skincare products, even though I was not interested. Otherwise, wonderful experience!< /Text>

< Review>
I love getting my facials at Skincare by Erika. Maybe 2 years ago I purchased a Groupon for a facial there after I saw that a friend of mine had given Erika a glowing review.  Well after my 1st facial, I was hooked and have been going every 6 weeks since.  Their products are all natural and smell awesome, the neck and head  massage that are included are divine.  I've had facials with 3 different estheticians, and I love them all.  My skin has never looked better!</Review>

I’ve been going to Skincare by Erika for waxing and facials and I have to say the quality of the service is Excellent. Waxing is fast and painless, the wax is high quality too. As for the facials, they are the best, they use the Clarisonic to exfoliate and all the products are high quality too, they also provide a complimentary makeup service with the facial. Ria has been fabulous every time I’ve gone and I’m looking forward to my next visit. Thank you Skincare by Erika!</Text>

My skin look great afterwards with a good glow. The spa was nice with a professional look, convenient location, and friendly and professional staff. Would definitely revisit for a facial.</Review>

I know that's a long time, I have the normal amount of carpet but the wax'er was extremely detailed and went through everything and made sure there was not one stray hair left!

I'm just saying make sure you feed your meter for that hour or park in a parking garage because you will get a ticket for sure I saw like 3 meter maids patrolling!

The location has only 3 employee's so its a little hard to get an appointment but if you call in they are always welcome to help =) I was a little scared to give my credit card information but everything fell into place =]< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
I came to Skincare by Erika with a deal (either groupon or livingsocial).
Services were prompt and good. Convenient location.
The reason why I am not a huge fan is that I felt the place was a little too sparse and clinical for my taste. I prefer spas to have a more low light and soft feeling.</Review>

I had a groupon deal for a facial and it was a great experience. Definitely going back. The place was clean and had a very relaxing feel to it. Ria, esthetician #4, was professional and delightful. She took her time--a whole 1.5 hours--and gave me a nice hand massage while my peel set. She answered all my questions and offered tips for skincare. I highly recommend it. My skin feels great!</text>

I had a GroupOn coupon for a facial but I ended up - at the gentle recommendation of the specialist - asking for a microderm abrasion too. I was worried my skin would flare up, because I am pretty sensitive. My skin looked great the moment I walked out the door from Erika's - bright, healthy, no problem whatsoever.

I had a groupon deal for a micro dermabrasion.  Great experience.  They catered to my skin's needs and requests, and I left feeling that my skin was very clean.  I also felt that they were not skipping steps because it was a groupon bought facial, which was nice.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would return.</Review>

Overall the workers were very friendly and talkative. You wait in the lobby until you are met by your esthetician who takes you to your room to do your procedure. They use a blue wax that apply with a wooden stick, which hardens up and they they pull! It gets less painful the more you go and you do get a discount if you go there regularly, but if you don't (more than 6 weeks), they'll charge you as if you were a first time customer. They also pluck hairs that wasn't taken out by the wax. My only complaint is that every single person seemed to be pushing their products at the end of the session, or pushing their deals at the end.< /review></record>

<review>Initially went here for the first time through a groupon deal for a facial and I am super glad that I did. The esthetician that worked on my skin was fantastic and did a good job of explaining the steps and purpose of what she was doing while still making it a relaxing experience. She suggested some add-ons to the facial and showed me some products afterward, but it was far from the pushy sales approach I've encountered at other spas. I was so pleased that I ended up booking my next appointment on the spot (which I rarely do). My skin looked amazing immediately afterward too, with no downtime despite having a peel. Highly recommend that you check this place out!<//review>< user_name>

I have had a facial and brazilian wax here. I can honestly say Erika provides one of the best services in San Francisco. I had a deep pore cleansing facial with micro dermabrasion, and my skin looked fabulous. If it wasn't for my busy travel schedule, I would book with her more frequently. The facial left my skin glowing and I loved that she kept me informed about all of the products she used.

The brazilian wax was thorough, fast, and left my skin without a lot of irritation. I would recommend this place!< /review>

I don't often get facials; I feel they are kind of a splurge and I can take care of my own skin, thank you very much. Plus I have sensitive skin that I don't trust to just anyone, but when I learned of Skincare by Erika through a deal on LivingSocial and read several positive reviews about her services, I decided to give it a try. I was impressed by her knowledge and by the results of the microdermabrasion facial she performed. My skin glowed for days but it was not irritated or red and it didn't break out. The office was not a zen spa and not a doctor's office, but clean and comfortable and perfectly adequate for the facials and other services performed. Erika was terrific, informative, friendly and answered all my questions. I am a believer and definitely looking forward to the next time!</review>

<Text>I had an awful experience when I went here. I made an appointment for a brazillian wax and a facial. I thought it was a joke that my brazilian wax appointment was for a full hour. But it definitely took up the whole hour! The technician was extremely anal looking through a magnifying glass and plucking specific hairs. It was so painful. I'm of the belief that the best brazilian waxes are 15 minutes....going through that process for a full 60 minutes is just cruel and unusual punishment. The weirdest part to was that the technician asked if her boss could come in (presumably after) to check her work citing that they wanted to make sure things were of the highest quality and customers were happy. She came in looked straight at my bikini area and told the technician she did a great job, then she looked at me. It was quite odd. If they really wanted to focus on customer satisfaction, they'd have the technician leave the room and let ME describe how my service went. I don't remember the facial because of the traumatic experience after.  Regardless to say, I have not been back.

Though I do have a friend who goes regularly and who has had a way different experience than me. So my advice would just be to research your technician before you get there.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am a Groupon customer, but was not treated as such.  In my past experiences as a Groupon customer: 1) I either get really bad services, or 2) you get what you pay for.  I've been to Skincare By Erika once and I would have to say scheduling an appointment was a breeze.  The place was clean and staffs were very friendly.  It's a place I would definitely come back even without a Groupon.  I was very happy with how quick, efficient, and easy the who process/services was.<//Text>< pictures>

I first came to Skincare by Erika on a groupon and kept going back! It was a great waxing experience and mostly not painful. I was a returning customer for nearly 2 years before I moved to NY. Definiteley recomend this place if you are in the Bay Area and want a good waxing experience!</review>

I tried out Skincare by Erika because of the Groupon deal they were having. When I went to the office, I upgraded my regular facial to a microdermabrasian facial. Overall, the facial was nice and I felt taken care of. Didn't really see too many results afterwards but from what i heard, it's important to do these once every 1-2 months so maybe i just need to continue. They told me about a promotion they were having that was 5 sessions for a discounted price...i originally took it but then cancelled as i found another facial place that i've liked more. Would probably only go back if there was a special promotion...otherwise i would try other places</Text>

The esthetician was very knowledgeable and super nice. I noticed that my hair grew back faster than usual so I think she broke a lot of the hairs off instead of getting the root.</Review>

I have been getting microdermabrasion facials at Skincare By Erika for a few months now. I have noticed significant improvements in my skin, including smaller pores, fewer acne breakouts, and reduced appearance of acne scars. The aestheticians are friendly, knowledgable, and very skilled.<//Text>

I first came to SBE with a Groupon and I've been a monthly client ever since -  something like 2yrs (give or take). Ria is such a cheerful person and an awesome esthetician! I highly recommend her for facials and waxing. I've used nothing but the Rhoda Allison products and I love them. But SBE's coming out with their own product line so as I'm finishing up the RA products I still have, and I'll be using the SBE products I recently purchased. I couldn't be happier with the place, staff, and products :-)<//text>

I found making appointments incredibly easy, the staff courteous, and my aesthetician, Ria, amazingly friendly and skilled.  I've never had such a quick, painless wax and very little redness after (not to mention less hassle during the regrowth).  Highly recommended, a lot of service for the price poiint< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I had a groupon, and it was my first time at Erika's.  I liked the price (cheap even w/o a groupon) and location, and Erika was very nice.  I had an ok time with my wax - the esthetician made me feel a bit chastised for waiting to come in, and I think the wax was a bit too hot, and it slightly burned or irritated my skin.  When I told the esthetician I thought the wax was too hot, she said something like "No this is how it is supposed to be."<//text>

I came to know skin by erika through a groupon deal. I was excited to try this salon so I bought a coupon from groupon.
To make an appointment for any kind of service they provide there customers two options call on a phone number or through there website. I am a busy lady so I always find calling a phone is the fastest method of making an appointment. But alas after trying to get connected via phone several time but no body picks up and always the calls get directed to there automated recorded message which says go to there website. I end up booking an appointment through there bad bad website. There website make you fill up a long form and then you come to know that you will get the earliest appointment no earlier than a week.  I booked it one and then I realized I picked up a wrong date. So I tried to reschedule it online through there website. Alas! what a horrible experience that website don't have a feature to reschedule your appointment. Then I tried to call the phone number again to reschedule it and again the answering machine picked up. Telling me to go to the same bad website or send them an email  on a different email address which is at yahoo if I want to cancel any appointment. but i want to reschedule it. So to reschedule it i now have to send an email to them to cancel an existing one and then reschedule it by again going to there bad website to find the availability.
i wonder why they make so hard for the customers before even trying there service.
Simple booking and rescheduling of an appointment with them has taken so much of effort/ energy and my time. I am already burnt with this experience that I am scared to even try there service. I am planning to even cancel my groupon and get my money back. if you have time and energy then deal with them otherwise dont waste it.<//Text>

<review>I had the best facial of my life over the weekend. I bought a Groupon for a 60 minute facial and scheduled an appointment. I didn't particularly like their online system, but when I had to reschedule, they were very helpful over the phone.

Ariel was AMAZING! She is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and professional. She identified my skin type, told me what products I should be using, and helped me develop a pre-wedding facial plan. The products that were used on my face smelled and felt great, and when she asked if I wanted a microdermabrasion upgrade, I said yes. It was my first time having microdermabrasion done, and I really enjoyed it! After the facial, I asked if she had time to do some waxing, and thankfully she did. I had my underarms waxed for the first time, and I'm so glad I had Ariel do it, she's such a pro! The wax that they use is a lot less painful that the normal stuff that you get at nail salons.

After my facial and waxing, Ariel showed me all of the products that she used and explained what each product did. There wasn't any pressure to buy anything, but I ended up buying a starter kit just to see if I liked the line. I will definitely be going back every month for  a wax and a microdermabrasion facial!< /review>< Rating>

< Review>
I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.

I first heard about Skincare by Erika through Groupon and I thought, "$50 for a facial? Why not?"  To be honest, at that point, I wasn't much of a facial enthusiast nor have I even had more than 2 facials in my life, but I knew I did want to start taking better care of my skin.  Skincare by Erika had me pleasantly surprised.

Going in, I didn't really know what to expect.  Melissa was my original esthetician and she made the new experience very easygoing.  While Melissa did a great job in making me feel comfortable and relaxed, what made me come back was the GLOW that I noticed the day after.  I knew this was something I wanted to continue on doing.  I had the delux microdermabrasion and peel.  On the website, it states that it "Includes skin analysis, cleansing, a customized fruit enzyme peel for your skin type, the microdermabrasion treatment, extractions, a finishing mask and a neck, shoulders and décolleté massage."

Now, they have me hooked!  I am an avid facial enthusiast.  Ria is currently my go-to esthetician (Melissa no longer works there).  While I was a little apprehensive about switching estheticians (will she know what to do with my skin? Does she know how my skin reacts to different products?) Ria made the transition SO SMOOTH and SO WONDERFUL.  Ria is extremely experienced and knowledgeable and definitely very pleasant to talk to.  HER MASSAGES. ON MY FACE (to work the product in). ON MY SHOULDERS (to pass time while we let the product sit [Ria never sits idle; she is always making sure you get your full hour's worth of service]).  Very, very relaxing and you can tell she knows what pressure points to hit.  I always leave there telling myself that I need to pamper myself more (Because I deserve it!)  I currently hold the package deal, where 5 sessions come out to be $400 (which is $80 per session, not including tip).  Just FYI the Groupon deal is only valid for first-time users.  However, for that amount of money, I would say that it's worth it.  I look forward to my monthly sessions with Ria and I know that I'm paying good money for a good product.  My skin used to be blemished, dull, and full of scars (from acne).  Now, it is much smoother, brighter, and less congested.

Make your appointment with Skincare by Erika! This is a must and your skin will thank you for it!< /Review>

I love Skincare by Erika.  I've had probably 12 or more facials there, as well as additional services such as brow waxing, lash and brow tinting, and a few others.  I love the Rhonda Allison products, especially the brightening scrub that smells of sandalwood.  Erika is a very skilled, knowledgable and personable aesthetician, and she has always been very sensitive to my financial challenges, offering me more affordable options when I can't afford the top of the line services.  The office is professional yet welcoming; I love the golden buddha face in one of the rooms.  I can't speak for any of the aestheticians except for Erika herself, because I always schedule with her, but as the owner of the business, I expect that she runs a very professional ship with high standards..  I don't like having to park in a parking lot, but if I plan ahead, I can easily take muni.  I definitely recommend Skincare by Erika.< /Text>

Got a Asada taco for my son he tried it an immediately gave me back the taco tried it myself and the meat was undercooked and no flavour whatsoever he just ate the tortilla since it was handmade and it was a 20 minute wait time for just one taco went around 2:30pm on a Friday this was at the La playa on Bellevue and Shaffer I will continue to go to there other location since it has better cooks apparently and not same food is offered at both locations.< /Review>

We just went here for lunch. This place has the BEST Mexican seafood I have ever eaten. The food, service, and people who work here are quite excellent. It was wonderful to have a taco with a home made pressed right in front of you, tortilla. The ceviche was also amazing!! We felt so energized after eating here..no food coma what so ever! We are here for another night, and We can't wait to get back there for dinner tomorrow. Don't miss this place!! Quite a gem in Atwater for sure 👍👍👍👍< /review>

This is the only local seafood restaurant of which I'm aware. I got the fish ceviche tostada, and it was good. Next time I'll try the fish fillet in foil paper (supposedly some kind of bass). Premium items are pricey, but quality seafood is inherently expensive, so I don't hold it against them.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I like everything very well, almost perfect ... that is, if I would like the Young woman to carve the garrafon a little stronger on the outside because it makes it very superficial. But I love that the lids put them As in something that stops a microwave and a light that disinfects them

(Original)
Me gusta todo muy bien casi perfecto... eso si me gustaria que la Joven tallara un poquito Mas fuerte por fuera El garrafon porque lo hace muy superficial. Pero me Encanto que Las tapaderas Las ponen Como en algo q parese un microondas y una Luz que alpareser Las desinfecta<//Review>

<Review>Stu is great! Dials my hair in just right every time and he doesn’t waste anytime. That said, you never feel rushed and he will always make sure everything is looking and feeling good before you leave. I highly recommend Stu if you are looking for a barber that is fast but very attentive to detail. Never a bad cut, always a great experience!< /Review>< gmapID>

I've been going to Stuart for more than two years, and every haircut has been great! He's efficient, friendly, and always on time. I started with him at his old barbershop and followed him here when he went out on his own. His prices are extremely reasonable for a fast, high-quality haircut. I would highly recommend you give him a try!<//Text>

Like finding a good mechanic and dentist a good barber can make your life so much better. I have been getting my hair cut by Stuart for over 5 years now and couldn’t be happier. I know what to expect and he consistently delivers. There is no risk in entrusting your hair to this man. I have bumped in to his other customers and the praise is all the same.<//review>

I’ve been coming to Stuart for years and can always count on great service and a great cut. The most important thing for me with getting my hair cut is consistency,  and he nails it every single time.  He’s also very accommodating with my busy schedule and always manages to fit me in for an appointment.
Thanks Stuart!<//Text>

Stuart is definitely the best barber I know and I have been going to him for the past 5+ years. Consistency is key with haircuts and Stuart gets the job done right every time. If you pay attention to detail and you are looking for a new barber who cares about his clients and quality of service, Stuart is your guy!<//text>

<Review>Stuart is an excellent barber! He’s been cutting my hair for about three years and I couldn’t be more satisfied. He remembers exactly how I like it, offers good suggestions on improvements, and is great to talk to during my haircut.

I've been seeing Stewart for a few years and I am truly grateful for his talents. He learned my style and has been consistent every since. This new location is a modern suite which is for perfect for me as I prefer a quiet environment where I can speak freely or choose to have a quiet cut. Sometimes Stewart I don't talk much and it's perfectly comfortable. Other times we talk a lot. I value his versatility and professionalism!<//Text>

Been going to Stuart for about 5 years now! Hands down my favorite barber that I will continue going to for as long as I can, his knowledge on beards and styling is amazing. Very friendly and caring! I can always can be myself and relax while having great conversations. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for an amazing haircut/beard trim!!!< /Review>

<username>Adriana Elson</username><Date>1568344774925<//Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>Stuart is the best!! Both my son and husband have been seeing him for a couple years now. He was at another location working for a chain company previously and recently has struck out on his own. I just took my son to see him at his newly established business, Swiftly and with Style, and just loved the space. The shopping center is small and a little dated, but he is located in a private suite within My Salon on the outside of the front left building. It's been totally remodeled and upgraded inside and very chic. The waiting room is small but nicely appointed.

Swiftly and with Style is also the perfect name. He always completes his haircuts on my son super quick and still does an amazing and thorough job without fail. Every busy moms dream! He is very talented and is the first person to be able to tame my sons thick and curly hair and melt his often surly, teenage attitude with his British accent and friendly demeanor! My husband also goes to Stuart and always comes back looking fantastic.

Ladies, start sending your sons and husbands/boyfriends/fiancés to Stuart right away! You will be happy you did, I promise!< /Text>< pics>

Stuart is great.  He always does a great job and while I never feel rushed, he is very efficient and in 30 minutes or less I look my best as I walk out the door. He does great beard trims too!  He is also the only barber that my son asks to see when he needs a cut.  I highly recommend Stuart!<//review>

Stewert is an awesome barber with a talent of style.

Clean, professional, great pricing, roomy, plenty of parking, and never disappointed with my haircut.  Stuart has styled my hair for a few years now and every time, no matter how long between visits, it's like visiting an old friend; like no time has passed, good conversations, and knows exactly what you want.

I have been seeing Stuart for years. Always cuts my hair perfectly, never have to tell him how I want it, he just knows. It’s more than a hair cut, it is like getting together with an old friend.< /Review>

My son and I have used Stuart for many many years, and would strongly recommend him to all our friends.  It is also a plus to be able to speak to a fellow Brit every two weeks ;)
A true gentlemen and a great barber.< /Review>

I went to 4 other barbers before Stuart and was unhappy. I have thin hair and a couple of weird cowlicks. Stuart was able to cut may hair in a way that it didn't look thin and he was able to tame my cowlicks. I've followed him to his new location which is about 15 minutes further for me but his cuts are worth the extra drive!<//review>

I have been going to Stuart for my haircuts for 5+ years now. He is the GOAT.  Extremely professional, very experienced, and his prices are super fair for a quality cut/shave/trim etc. I refuse to go anywhere else.<//text>

VERY good with kids and thats saying a lot because mine can be a HANDFUL! Did "progress sessions" to make sure he was giving my son exactly what he wanted.
Super clean shop and to put the icing on the cake, he is some EYEEE CANNNDYYYYY! 😍👀 I'm suprised all the single moms don't have him all booked up for their sons. I was getting ready to go back to see if he could line me up! 🤣🤦🏽‍♀️❤️</Review>

Kevin is the best nail tech ever he's been doing it for years, he cares about his work so much, he uses excellent quality  product, his nails BASICALLY come with a warranty.First time I went he told me if  anything happens to them(break,color,shape.etc) to come back and hell fix them for free.For almost three years I've been going to him  and in those three years I haven't had a single complaint 🤩</review>

<review>My first and last time having my nails done there. Where in this entire America do you pay $109 for a simple gel manicure and gel pedicure?? I didn't even get a design nor did I get an acrylic. This nail shop claim that  there prices went up due to the pandemic, my question is; is iteit legal to charge what we normally pay $50 and now paying charged $109?  This has to be reported to the BBB as they are not running an honest business. I was very disappointed walking out of the nail studio. Again, first and last day EVER going there.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The only place I will go for acrylic nails!  I went to 5 different salons before I found them. I can get a fill once a month and they look new the whole time. Quality is outstanding! Kevin has been doing my nails now for 6 years....never had one lift or break. I need them to re-open!!!< /text>

<Review>Went in to get my nails done and was fairly pleased with the service here! The techs are very pleasant and sociable. The salon is spotless from head to toe. Didn't had that chemical smell in the salon. When it was my turn the nail tech working on me was very good at removing the cuticles from my nails. Didn't even bleed from that process. She also listen to my requests too. When she was done, my nails looked very refined! 😍😍😍<//Review>< Pics>

The first person that did my nails made my nails look bumpy, messy, and see-through. I then demanded for them to fix them. Then, another lady fixed my nails, still leaving paint residue on my fingers. Meanwhile, it took my aunt around 1 hour to get just a pedicure, which left no time for a manicure.</review>

<Review>Worse mani & pedi ever. I went into to get mani & pedi. Cindy did my nails and cut my cuticles so bad on both hands they would not stop bleeding. Worse part abt it was that instead of cleaning the blood or stopping the service she tried to paint over the blood stained n residue nails and continue to double dip into the polish. I told her it was unsanitary and she disagreed.  The pedi girl basically just washed my feet and polished my toes not a real pedi. She didn't even try she just seemed uninterested. From my observations,  These nail techs are inexperienced and definitely needs lesson on being sanitary. I doubt if they are even licensed professional or they would know about being clean and sanitary.  I wouldn't recommend this place to any one instead I would warn you not to go to this place.<//Review><user_name>Em Jones</user_name>< Gmap_id>

<text>Best place for authentic Italian desserts. Their place has a sign that says something along the lines of “you love us, you just don’t know it yet” and honestly that’s so true. Their cannoli is on point and even though we entered as they were closing they still served us, and even gave us free dessert. They made the cannoli fresh since they ran out. I am very pleased!</text><resp>None< /resp><Name>Ala'a Tolba</Name><date>1520456439269< /date></record>

<review>Day out doing errands - hubby and I were both hungry .We decided to try Hungry Lu's. As I walked up to order a meatball sandwich - which was outstanding - I could not help but notice their assortment of Italian cookies! Not a chance I was going to leave without a sampling. So glad we did - they were 'DELISH'.

Since that initial visit I have ordered assortments of their cookies to serve to guests and everyone raves about how yummy they are!

This initial visit was in August and I am delinquent in this 5 star review but better late than never. I highly recommend both their sandwiches and COOKIES!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The Hungry Lu's Special, toasted, is maybe the best torpedo in San Diego.
All of the sandwiches and pizzas are great.  My only problem is staying away from his fresh baked cookies. I am a regular here, and I recommend it to anybody who is looking for lunch.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Decent Italian sandwiches, though nowhere close to what you'd find in Brooklyn.  The bread was the best part.  Their sweet selections looked great.</text>

OK, I grew up on the east coast, Boston to be exact. Yo they bake their rolls daily here, they got that peppercini, classic oil and vinegar. I went here yesterday after just moving back to CA from Boston. If I'm in OB, I WILL be going to Lu's no matter what. They also have a bomb dessert selection, great drinks, indoor and outdoor seating, and the staff is as friendly as your best friend, and they mean it. If I could rate 6 stars, you can bet Lu's would get it. This place basically changed my view on the lack of east coast sub-style food in San Diego. I'm really relieved to know this place exists. So ya, it's that kinda seriously good.<//Review>

Yesterday my husband called to get canolli for my son's10th BD...the only dessert he asked for, but they ran out. Today he stopped by to pick some up for a belated celebration and was given a cute canolli kit to assemble at home! He loved it!!!!! What a special thing to do! Thank you Lu!< /Review>

As a native NYer living in Arizona, I miss good Italian deli and pastries. We went in on a whim while visiting a business on the block and were not disappointed. The cannoli and macaroon were the best I ever had. We returned on the way out of town for Italian subs and more pastries for the road. The bread was fresh baked, fresh deli meat, and delicious. This will be a return spot on future vacations.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>I came here purposely to try out the Amaretti cookies. My sister LOVES these type of cookies and there were reviews on Yelp that they make them here. I came here and  bought 5 of them ($1 a piece - a bit pricey for the size of the cookie) and 2 wedding cookies. They did have sandwiches too that looked appealing but I did not get any at this time. The wedding cookies were a bit dry and tasted a little bit burnt. However, the outside sugar powder was delicious. (Almond flavor)  The Amaretti cookies were AMAZING. They were chewy and had a super delicious flavor. If you are expecting the cookies to be harder (like the small imported Italian ones), they are not so hard. They are a little bit hard around the outside, but oh so chewy and sweet and flavorful inside. I will definitely be marking this spot as my favorite place to get these cookies in SD.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Great little Italian sub shop a few blocks from the dog beach. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They bake their own bread and other baked goodies and it smells incredible in this shop.

We had an Italian sub and a roast beef, toasted. They were big and super tasty. We both had a snack for after the beach. We sat outside and the sandwiches were out to us.

We will definitely return for cookies and cannolis... I ate enough gluteb in that sub but the baked goods looked and smelled AMAZING!<//Review>< pictures>

Categorically worth every one of its five stars. Run by someone who clearly loves their business we were warmly welcomed and served some delicious cookies and baked goods. A sweet interior, great music, nicely laid out. This was a post dinner sugar fix but we'll be back to try their savoury stuff in the future. The raspberry filled chocolate drizzled cookie sandwich was as good as it sounds.<//review>

I love a good sandwich and for me the key factor is how fresh the bread is. With bread made in house daily I have never had a bad sandwich from this place.<//text>

They are always accommodating with special orders, and have fantastic homemade Italian cookies, friendly service, and are appropriately priced.  Seriously, do yourself a favor and get a cookie or fresh homemade cannoli every time you go in.

Hungry Lu's is very good yet the subs are not as good as Grab & Go Subs and Sandwiches. Albeit, Hungry Lu's has an extensive offering of freshly made Italian pastrys.<//text>

Great sandwiches! The hungry lu's special and Italian are both delicious. I keep wanting to try other sandwiches here because I don't doubt they'll be awesome too, but everytime I go either of those two just sound so good it's hard to try another one. I'll just have to go more often.< /Text>

I was super excited about this place. Spent 40 bucks on 6 cannoli's and a nice size box of mixed cookies. Cookies were buttery and light but the cannoli cream was a huge disappointment, filling was less than slightly sweet but over powering with lemon. I've been eating cannoli's since birth and vanilla has always been the main flavor with maybe a hint of cinnamon. Shells were nice tho.<//Text>

Easily the Best cannoli in town! These guys not only make their own cannoli shells but the ricotta cream filling is this ultra tasty, whipped to perfection cream that you just can't stop eating. All the other sweet treats are no less impressive. Many types of cookies and all of them fresh and uncompromisingly delicious. Definitely try the macaroons and the chocolate dipped cookies.
On the sandwich side they make spectacular subs, mostly with traditional Italian ingredients, some of them toasted. I just had the eggplants and mozzarella sammy and it's an instant favorite.
There is some outside seating, so you can enjoy your lunch/dessert without delay.
A great contribution to the neighborhood.< /Review>

<review>Karen and I have been shopping for a new mattress
for a while visiting several stores and trying several different kinds.  I found Mattress Firm on line so we visited your showroom in Costa Mesa where we were greeted by salesman Adam Cortes.  Adam was very knowledgeable, informative, had good suggestions about what might be a good fit for us, and was very
patient.  We gathered the information we needed and then a few 2days later returned to purchase a mattress.  Adam walked us through the purchase and financing processes in a smooth manner. We would have no hesitation in referring others to Adam.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Clay was really the best employee. He was prudent and kind and extremely thoughtful.
He explained things very well so that I was able to easily understand even the technical details. He expertly recommended a product that fit my budget.
Honestly, I really appreciate how he treated me, and I’ll be sure to actively recommend him to my friends nearby and the Asian community. Clay was really the best employee!!!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Clayton was all around amazing with helping us find the perfect mattress! We were driving around all day, going to different stores, and were about to give up, when we found this place. He truly took care of us by finding us the best deal! We walked out with a king sized bed, 2 insanely comfortable pillows, sheets, and protector sheets all within our budget. When you guys visit look for Clayton!</Review>

<Text>We stopped by just to check out the mattresses and didn’t expect to find anything just yet, but we actually did thanks to Steve! Steve was great and helped us choose the mattress that best fits our needs. He also made us feel comfortable and gave us the space and time to feel the mattresses. Thanks Steve!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Incredibly pleasant experience thanks to Clayton Spires, he was very polite and super helpful/informative. I don't usually review places but my experience was so good here I'm more than happy to share. I highly recommend going to this store if you're thinking about purchasing a new mattress. I was planning on purchasing something online but decided to pop into this store to get some more info on a particular mattress I was interested in and Clayton ended up helping me buy it for half the price it was online thanks to a deal the mattress company had with Mattress Firm. I was blown away.< /Text>< Pictures>

Clay was a fantastic sales representative! He went above and beyond to ask the right questions and make sure I bought the perfect mattress set for my needs! I appreciate his working hard to get me the best deal for my purchase. He was friendly and knowledgeable about all of your products. I didn’t want to go into a store during the pandemic, and he made purchasing over the phone a pleasure! I highly recommend Mattress Firm, and will refer friends who are looking for mattresses to you and Clay for his excellent customer service!</review>

Today I walked into the store not really knowing what type of bed I was looking for. Clay was awesome. He walked me through the store, answered all of my questions and addresses all my concerns.  He helped me find a mattress that fits my budget and I think I got a pretty sweet deal.
Clay’s cool vibe and easy going personality  made mattress shopping less confusing and a whole lot less stressful!<//review>

My fiancé and I went looking for new pillows and Adam was the biggest help. He was showing and teaching us how important pillows are for your body, and helped us find the perfect pillows for the both of us. We learned that with him being a back sleeper and me a stomach sleeper, we need very different pillows. 10/10 Thank you Adam<//Text>

< Review>
In this time when everything has become so difficult Steven L at Mattress Firm in Costa Mesa made things a breeze.  He greeted me kindly while wearing his mask and maintaining appropriate social distance.  Steven took his time with me as he explained the benefits and differences in each mattress.  I was uncertain what I wanted and Steven guided me to the perfect bed.  The whole experience was a pleasure.  I ended up with a hybrid.  Who knew that would be my choice??!!  There was never any pressure, just a good salesman who knew his products. who helped me find my perfect bed.  Oh!  The store was clean.  I felt safe as I lay on many mattresses.  Because really you need to try a mattress before you make a choice.  I just didn’t feel I could do that online and with Steven L and Mattress Firm I didn’t have to.  Thank you Steven I look forward to many restful nights.  And thank you Mattress Firm for maintaining a storefront where I could test the products and hiring a knowledgeable and professional sales person.<//Review>

<Review>i love this place. my roommate and i wish we could live here, but since we can’t, a visit will have to do. Clay is probably the nicest person I have ever met. Great conversation and we picked out a great mattress that works for me and my back issues. I think everyone should get their mattresses here.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Carl T was outstanding. Despite being in sales, I actively avoid salespeople and was thinking of purchasing a mattress online. On a whim I went to this store and had the pleasure of working with Carl. He is an expert and a professional. I felt safe even during the pandemic as they sanitized all the beds, all the employees practiced social distancing, and wore their masks. Carl helped me find a bed in my budget, took the time to explain my choices clearly, and helped me find the bed of my dreams. I highly recommend this store and Carl who was trustworthy and consultative in guiding me through the process. Also, I was in somewhat of a time crunch and he was efficient in helping me find a mattress. If you want a straightforward, helpful, and knowledgeable salesperson definitely seek out Carl at Mattress Firm!</review>< Pics>

Clay is the MAN!
Walking out really excited with my purchase, first time ever having to go and look for a bed so i did not know what to really expect or even how much i would be walking out spending . Showed me around the store and different kind of mattress’s got to try some out and see which ones i liked best , also what kind of mattress’s were around my budget . Good guy  very helpful definitely glad i made a stop here and didnt fall into buying a bed at the store i stopped by before coming to Mattress Firm.

Thanks Clay!< /Text>

Ask for Clay. Friendly and professional. I like a softer mattress while my gf likes more firm. Clay took the time to find the best mattress for both of us, he showed us a variety of options at different price points so didn't make us feel pressured. Clay was awesome, thanks for the help, look forward to my new mattress!!</Review>

My Salesman was named Carl , glad I choose this night to look for a mattress... He was very knowledgeable, polite and professional !! He was able to ask me the right questions and explained the my issue and had me try different mattresses... again he knew his products, Mattress Firm should feel lucky to have a employee like this who took the time and made this shopping experience a great one. I will be telling friends where to purchase a mattress when they need one. Thanks Carl !</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I needed a Serta mattress delivered asap and got to the Harbor Blvd store CMesa - CA on a Friday night, Sept 11/20, 15 mins before closing, already excusing myself. I was helped by the best salesperson I’ve ever met : Clay ( not sure if this is his correct name. He was excited to help, very knowledgeable about all his products and I don’t have words to explain how satisfied I am with the process. I hope my review gets to the management. An employee like that is a dream of any business... I would ‘steal’ him on the spot if I was a business owner . Plus, I got Z best price for my Serta mattress and it will b delivered within 48 hours of my purchase. The whole process took 15 mins.

Great experience working with Clay at the Costa Mesa store. Didn’t have the mattress protector in store that I needed, so he ordered it for me to pick up in a few days. Clay is knowledgeable about the products and was extremely enjoyable to work with throughout the process. Would definitely recommend seeing Clay at the Mattress Firm store in Costa Mesa for your mattress needs.<//Review>

I have been in the retail automobile business since 1982.  Kristen gave my wife and I an absolutely wonderful experience. She greeted us professionally and with enthusiasm. My wife has a bad back and she guided us towards the correct mattress for her. Very professional very knowledgeable. It was a pleasure doing business with her.  We were going to shop one other store but because of Kristen  we did not. We bought because of her and her alone.</text>

I came here to purchase a box spring for my new apartment. STEVE was such a great help! I was worried about not being able to get it delivered in time, however Steve went above all & worked to get it to me even with such short notice. Definitely recommend Mattress Firm & this Costa Mesa location specifically :) thanks again Steve!!<//review>

Sonya was fantastic! We had no idea what we were looking for and have never looked for a mattress before, but she made it super easy and comfortable. I’m not just saying this, i really mean it. You’re in good hands if you go here! If I could give more stars I would. Overall great experience!!<//Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>Wow! Such an outstanding experience with my sales genius, not sales rep. His name is John Jamison. He was so informative and professional. It’s nice when you walk in to spend hundreds of your hard earned dollars and someone isn’t pushy but wants to help you to find what’s best for you. The bed was for my teen and he spent the time to help explain the different options. I can hardly wait for my son to get his bed because I know I made the best choice. John J, I want you and your company to know that you represent this company well. OUTSTANDING! I might be back soon to get myself a new mattress and wouldn’t go anywhere else nor have another person help in my decision.

Sonya is remarkable! Knowledgeable, helpful, easy to work with, and very thorough. I needed help finding what another Mattress Firm in another state had in stock, and she called them multiple times and walked me through the process. She helped me figure out the best mattress for my budget and followed through after I left - even staying a little late after hours so that I could complete the transaction. Please go see Sonya at this Mattress Firm location!! You won’t be sorry. Honestly, she will make buying a mattress easy and enjoyable.<//review>

Sonya! What a doll! She helped me find the perfect mattress at the perfect cost (all under $500), and didn’t put the salesy pressure on. I told her what I wanted, and she delivered! Easy, fast, FRIENDLY experience. So glad to have stopped in here!
Can’t wait to get my mattress! :)
Thank you, Sonya!<//review>

Wow! Words cannot express how enjoyable an experience it was for us to shop for a new mattress. Buying furniture can be so stressful but the employees at Matress firm Costa mesa(Kevin, Shaun and John ) made the experience so pleasant and easy.
We are newlyweds, looking for something special for our new dream home. From the moment we stepped in they made the process smooth, they explained the pros and cons of each,  showed us different models, and only wanted what fit our needs. Never once did we feel that they were being “salesman” or feel haggled/cornered into purchasing.
They walked us through the process and acted like our friends instead of salesmen. And to add to their friendliness at the end they were so willing to work with us on the price. We asked for certain perks, they went above and beyond our expectations. We got an amazing bed for a great deal! If you are thinking of mattress shopping definitely drop by and give them a chance. You will not be disappointed! Best mattress shopping experience in my life! Will recommend to all my friends:)<//text>

I couldn't ask for a better place to go and get a mattress from. All the employees were very knowledgeable and helpful. Thank you John Jamison for helping me to choose the right mattress for my needs. Whenever I need another mattress or anyone I know needs a mattress I would recommend I would choose this place hands down.<//Text>

First I want to Thank Ms. Sonya Kemp Nkele for the best mattress shopping experience I've ever had. Her true concern about my needs in a mattress made this purchase a breeze. She was very knowledgeable of her products and she took her time with us to make sure we purchased the right mattress for us. I'm very pleased with the product and service we received from Ms. Sonya, I will tell my friends and anyone who is in the market for a mattress to go see Ms. Sonya she will definitely take good care of you.<//text>

I have a friend in the Las Vegas store and even though Kristen knew she wasn't getting the sale she went out of her way to help me as if she was getting the sale and the commission.

Kristen is an asset to Mattress Firm as a company for sure. By the time we got my friend, who is one of your top sales people in the country, on a video chat Kristen had already helped choose the perfect mattress.
My friend said to Kristen he will hopefully see her in Mexico. If there's a manger reading thIs.....SEND HER 😂.
Kristen if you are reading this. THANK YOU. You brightened up our day ;)< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Sonya, the manager, is the best example of what a salesperson should be! She showed what a professionalism is. Very personal and knew everything about mattresses and toppers that I asked about and more. Went in with no expectations of buying anything, but walked out with a foam mattress topper! Had to buy it because she was so nice and I do need one for my daughter.< /Review>

Sonya Kemp-Nkele was extremely helpful in my shopping/purchase experience on Nov 1, 2019.  Upon entering the store, she greeted me with a smile and friendly demeanor.  Received my new mattress on Monday.  so far, loving the new mattress and cool bed liner she sold me on.</Text>

<Review>As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Sonya. She was very kind and patient with me. I really didn't know what I wanted coming in. But she walked me thru the different types of mattresses they had and nicely explained the differences. I finally settled on one. She made the process very quick and easy. She even set up delivery right to my house and having my old mattress removed! Go see Sonya for your mattress needs! You won't regret it!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Just bought our mattress here. Sonya - the store manager/sales lady was very nice and pleasant to work with. She was not pushy like other mattress salespersons and yet we ended up buying instead of just having a look like our original plan. Sonya is very knowledgeable and shows you what works best for your need rather than sells you what is the most expensive thing in the store. And she managed to find me an early delivery slot than what communicated on her website. I had a much better deal vs. buying online.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>My fiancé and I recently made a purchase during their Black Friday sale and we couldn’t have been happier with our experience and Sonya was incredibly helpful! She is the manager here and she answered all of our questions, was knowledgeable and went above and beyond for us as my fiancé and I were having a difficult time agreeing with one another on which mattress and for what price. But Sonya broke down everything I needed to know to feel better about the purchase and helped me understand my fiancé’s side of things. We now have our bed (my fiancé won that fight) and I hate to admit it but they were both right! I love our mattress - thank you Sonya & Mattress Firm!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<text>very disappointed with management having this guy. John J. disrespectful to my wife making inappropriate comments I wonder how many more women he approach like that a report was done to corporate but it seems like they don't care. I haven't receive a message or a call apologizing that's shameful.< /text>< user_name>

Today was the best form of customer satisfaction I have ever received. After dealing with the stress of not getting our mattress due to stock issues, to deliveries being late, then to finally receiving a totally different mattress (which we hated), after all the phone calls of no one knowing what to do, or not doing anything in that matter, today on 11/12/2018 my girlfriend and I went into Mattress Firm of Costa Mesa and were greeted by Azita in sales, and her manager Jaron Krause. He listened to our troubles, and immediately went to work to turn our unfortunate experiences in to the best we've ever had with any company. Jaron knew the true meaning of customer satisfaction and we'll never forget it, we got a new mattress that we love, and are happy beyond belief. I cannot thank Jaron enough and would recommend him to all my loved ones and everyone I know. He really turned our thoughts about the company around, and there isn't a rating high enough for Jaron, I can promise anyone, If you ask for Jaron Krause you will not regret it, and be as happy as we are! Thank you Jaron, a true professional.<//Text>

<text>Anyone planning on going riding through Lewis Valley with TJ should know 1. She does not have the permission of the owners of the land you will be riding through and they are not happy. One of them has a lame dog due to a horse kick. 2. She has no respect for the people who have lived in this valley for years and has caused them terrible stress by leaving her horse trailer in the road blocking their only way out. People couldn't get to work, kids couldn't get to school and if there was an emergancie no fire truck or ambulance could get in. Something that has never ever been done by the residents of this valley. 3. Her answer to any problems she has caused is to walk away. No apology, no concern for the residents or their animals. Reading the reviews on here makes me think she only cares for paying clients.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The place is great, however if you're looking to purchase the realtor (DON STEWART) for saddle back is a joke. Don doesn't give you the full story of your options, he won't return phone calls or emails  and he ca be very condescending. Don lures you in and then screws you!!! I signed a contract with the park and then he sold the unit out from under me. All Don worries about is his paycheck... if I could rate him personally I'd give him a negative 10.
I would not use him, but find another realtor to help you thru the process, DO NOT USE DON STEWART of MH Village like it says too.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I have been buying their beer making kits for years.  But with the Corona19 hoax in full swing it makes it hard for a small shop to stay in business.  They seem to be doing ok for now and I wish them well and will try to support them.</Review>

The West Sacramento store has more products than any of the other locations hands down. The customer service is also better then the Folsom store. If you have any questions the staff is more then willing to share.</review>

Granted it's in West Sac and 5 minutes off the freeway because of traffic lights, BUT THIS PLACE ROCKS! They have everything you need for home brewing, from beginners to advanced. That stainless steel conical fermenter look great.

So it's worth the drive, but call first to talk to one of the friendly and helpful staff to make sure what you need is in stock. The have to quench many thirsty brewers.

Lastly, stop by one of the tap rooms that are stones throw away.</text>

Staff was super cool, they helped with the few questions I had and even helped with suggestions for a recipe. The selection here is reall good, lots of different malts and roasted barley. Yeast and hops selection was also really good. There were also a bunch of supplies to help with homebrewing, and wine making.  Definitely will keep coming here.<//Text>

Always super helpful and willing to give advice. I've stayed for hours chatting and they've always had a smile on their faces about it. Extremely knowledgeable and helpful and laid back. No pressure or hard sales. They love and value their customers a great deal and treat them well. My favorite brew store.</Review>

<Review>Overall, a good location and knowledgeable/friendly staff. I have been able to ask for their input on recipes and have not been steered wrong yet. Their grain/malt library is smaller than most I have come across but they have plenty of room to expand and add more when the time is right.< /Review>< Pics>

Great customer service! I ordered a kit online, and it was damaged in shipping (grain explosion!) - I let them know and got a response within a few hours that they were not satisfied until I was satisfied. They earned a lifelong customer here for as long as I continue to brew! Thanks Erik and your brew crew! Simply outstanding!</text>

His staff  so far has been stellar!  Matter of fact  I've visited the Folsom, Elk Grove  locations and recently the West Sac Store... All staff in each of those locations  were willing willing to help, answer question, look for product , if they didn't have something they were quick to  offer ordering options...etc..
Basicly  if you brew , do your self a favor and hit any of these locations... YOU won't be disappointed!</Text>< Pictures>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>Honestly, I've been in friendlier more broadly stocked homebrew stores all across the country.  For being one of the centers of the microbrewing explosion, it was disappointing to find this was the best Sacramento had to offer for home brewing supply.  Specifically, there was a surprising lack of selection in the yeast cabinet, and there was a disappointing selection of hardware options to expand into the amature-professional realm of home brewing.  Without many other local options though, looks like this will be my new home brew shop for its convenience and  it does get the job done.< /Review>< pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1486046258177, 'text': "Thanks for the review Patrick.  With three different liquid yeast brands, I'm surprised you couldn't find what you were looking for.  We carry an assortment of wyeast, white labs and imperial organic along with several dry strains.  We are happy to order any of their strains for you as well, we order pretty much every sunday.  As far as hardware, we also order weekly and are happy to source just about anything for you.  You are welcome to contact me directly for any need you have, erik@shopbrewmeister.com, and again, I appreciate your business and review."}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad40652b44ccb:0x82a35020c61535d4< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Used to be a great local business with friendly and knowledgeable staff. It have gone downhill considerably with terrible customer service and monopolistic practices.

This company sources most of their products through MoreFlavor Ltd, who sources grain, hops and other basic supplies through a national supplier. Basic grains, hops and general supplies direct from MoreFlavor is 30%+ less then Brewmeisters. The markup Brewmeister applies on 'specialty' gains is well in excess of 100% and MoreBeer is located within an hour of the greater Sacramento area, where Brewmeister operates. As an example, a 50lb sack of grain costs $30 through MoreBeer, $50 through Brewmeister.

You are much better off using any of the available online competition for your homebrew needs and won't have to deal with one of their rude employees.<//Review>

Great food and really nice folks there. Hayward doesn't have a lot of options beyond chain restaurants so it is great to have this place available!< /text>

<review>My sons basketball team was at a tourney in the east bay and we found Fogline to grab lunch between games.

Service was fast, everyone was nice and accommodating to our big party of parents and kids.

The highLight was THE FOOD!!! Some of the best wings I've ever had (lemon,pepper,garlic wings ). The team had several orders of their French fries and the "mini sampler" plate of wings, chicken strips, fried fish, and quesadilla were all delish!!

Looks like it is a fun club at night! Lots of big screen TVs for Watching Sunday football.

Highly recommend this place for his food atmosphere and customer service</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Nice, chill place to enjoy some drinks, and a pool table. I personally enjoyed my first Friday visit after work with co-workers. I'll be damned if I don't show up another Friday.</Text>

<review>Young Jesus and I came to visit this place to watch the warriors game , wonderful environment great staff bartender  made great drinks strong yet smooth. The service was  fast each table was tended to. The food was absolutely amazing!! If you want a laid back chill spot that is friendly and affordable this is the place !!! The ribs are very tender and sauce was enough not too much not too little be sure to try them!!! 10 stars from IG:@YoungJesusRDE and wife< /review>< pictures>

Beers are cheap. Their tacos are good bar food. Haven't tried much else on the menu. It gives of a more local vibe. There isn't much else going on there.<//Review>

I'm surprised there were so many negative reviews. I think for a Bay area bar it's pretty cool place to go after work or watch a game. The food is good and the prices are reasonable. Definitely, worth checking out.<//Text>

< Review>
I went there for a comedy show from my seat at the bar I was looking at roach spray behind the bar. they overbooked the room so the show had to end early and we were rushed out of the room for the next party. Service was shoddy at best but I noticed that service got better when the late night crew came on the venue obviously does not care about consistent service. The show I went for was good what I saw of it. But for a venue I will not be back. I do not like bad service from a bartender. If I'm there for a show run a tab, do not run my card for each purchase I make.</Review>

<Review>Service was lousy. Food took about 45 min for hamburger and fries. We had to beg people that work there to get our food from kitchen. They had 1 bartender who by the way was very nice. But overworked with all the people and she was waiting tables due to them not having waitress..</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Prices are OK. Couldn’t be a slower kitchen in Hayward though. Every time I come in there’s either no kitchen or takes 20-30 mins for a few tacos with an empty bar.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808f912dcf5ae68d:0x4750695a1192d023</Gmap_id><Time>1560547728522</Time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Jesse Maiwald<//username></record></dataset><record>

Not only is the food great but the service and staff is as well. We had a huge party and came in right before close and they rocked it! Prices are very modest for the quality. Definitely a go to and safe bet in Big Bear!<//text>

<Review>Great place for groups. Outside seating available with some shady areas. Food was excellent, got an asada burrito enchilada style (I order it half green half red salsa) and a round of margaritas for the 4 of us. Others ordered tortilla soup and shrimp cocktail. Everyone was happy with their food and drinks!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Even though the menu had been reduced the food and service is still excellent. Minus 1 star because several favorite dishes were no longer on the menu.< /text>

Please is amazing. The prices are what you expect for a sit down. But I say keep going. The drinks are off the hook.<//Text>

Worst service ever. The shirt the bartenders  wear says it all. I could go on and on...this place has no idea how to run a bar/restaurant...I sat at the bar for 2 hrs the bartender working the floor is the only guy making eye contact or doing anything for that matter..the guy working the bar was too busy making drinks for the restaurant  with only 3 people at the bar. Food was sub par...shrimp cocktail.  And I wouldn't know how the taquitos were because they " cant make only two" 🤷‍♂️<//Text>

We had 3 alcohol drinks Michelada was blah they put ice and it tasted like mostly clamato, I had a El matador that was bkmb and I had a paloma that one was delicious too. I got a Molcajete too that was delicious the Guacamole was so good but for the amount they give you I thought it was expensive. The Campechana was alright it needed a bit more flavor<//Text>

It very enjoyable the atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was very accommodating the food was very good although not my favorite Mexican restaurant that would be the Fuentes at the corner of Reseda and then on actually off the corner in San Fernando valley that's where you need to go to get the best wet burrito I've ever eaten if you could go there tell the owner I said hi sorry I don't have any pictures.<//Text>

<review>Our server, Alexis was amazing. He was so friendly and on point with his approach to the table; Visit in the beginning, drink orders, checking when we wanted more chips and beverages. Drinks came before Meal. Meal arrived in decent amount of time, correctly, well seasoned even down to the black beans. Management was also extremely accomodating with propane heaters, as all eating is outside til the snow hits. Side note, they are trying to open inside if the city approves it. So give them your business now so they can justify spending the money to expand the roofing over the front of the building where currently they only have shade sails. It's lovely to eat there, but it won't be possible with a month.< /review></record>

The staff and the food were great! Our server was alex and he was so kind. Laura is the manager and she was amazing too. We ordered the fajitas the barbacoa and the enchilada suizas. We added extra melted cheese and green sauce. All were delicious. It was our first time here. It’s a nice little spot in big bear. Definitely recommend.<//Text>

Nice restaurant and friendly staff. We
We ate chicken Taquitos, ceviche, beef burrito and shrimp cocktail
Taquitos were awesome.
Ceviche & Cocktail shrimp and burrito missed totally their flavor essence.
They need to focus on freshness. w 🍊 and lemon 🍋 wedges, they  were nasty..
Chef, please taste the food during the cooking process, it's very very important.< /Review>

Good Mexican food. Ok service. Nostalgic for me because my Grandma came here every taco Tuesday for years.
Nice patios for outdoor dining. My second FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Big Bear. Good flavors. Decent salsa.
Shrimp fajitas were so good!< /Text>

<text>Beautiful outdoor seating and great service and food. Perfect for a date (even after mountain biking, as there is potentially space for bikes if you are extra nice to the staff).
The outdoor seating caters to outdoorsy folks. Solid wood furniture on the dining patio lends great vibes.< /text>< Rating>

Also good flautas aren’t real flautas they are rolled up chimichangas i ate flautas in Mexico many times and know what flautas are! 😡 Chile Colorado burrito wasn’t Chile Colorado it has Chile spread over burrito which is not how Chile Colorado is supposed to be made. Also Guacamole was not good at all it taste sweet yuck!! Restaurant  needs to find a recipe for all these things they are not making them right ! These are only the things I’ve had their.

<Text>Amazing food, got the shrimp cocktail and carnitas burrito. This was an authentic shrimp cocktail, with avocados, cilantro, cucumbers in a sauce. Our server, Danny, was great! Very attentive and even though they were short handed that day he was always checking in on us. You must make this a stop if you are going to be in Big Bear.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I LOVE this restaurant. The food is amazing, but the homemade Salsa is to die for. We eat here at least once a week. Best Mexican food in Big Bear, by far.< /text>

<text>Again this place 100% authentic Mexican food.  Super nice servers.  Clean table and floor.  Got food fast.  Again I had the carne asada.  Excellent flavor.  Love the lime taste on the carne asada. The chili rojo burrito was also outstanding.  There's also a salsa bar with 3 different salsa's.  If you love spicier salsa ask your waiter for them to bring you one.  You won't be disappointed.</text><user_id>109692785435399392788<//user_id>< Pics>

I was just wondering is this mixing restaurant or a Taco Bell. Talk about blan food. Not even a little spice, including their so-called salsa (tomatoes and onions) really? Serious disappointment.<//Review>

My expectations for this place were very high. My friends and I were visiting Big Bear and for the pricing of the food we thought we were in for a treat. The Chile rellenos were tiny and lacking cheese. The Al Pastor meat was terrible. Burnt and lacking flavor. The Torta's bread was hard as a brick and the chicken was dry. They also forgot minor details like beans on the side and sour cream etc. that we ordered. The Orchata was also very watered down. Taste of Mexico? I don't think so. Other than that the employees were very nice and welcoming.<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Over priced for canned food. They nickle and dime everything we ordered kids bean and cheese burritos and they charged to add rice to them. The side of guacamole was supposed to be a buck they charged 2. The horchata doesn't have refills and the kids sized ones are the same price as the adults. The location and atmosphere was nice tho. What a waste of $100 for a family of 5.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>First time eating here, very good food.  I stopped here on a Saturday night minutes before closing time.  I was surprised they even seated us.  The manager said of course come on in.  The chips were a little old and I was prepared for bad a meal.  I was totally surprised by the end of the meal.  Servers were very attentive.  The salsa bar had good choices. I especially liked the pickled carrots and onions, lots of oregano.  I had the chicken burrito, wet with green sauce, and a side of guacamole.  Huge burrito.  Even though the staff were busy wrapping up for the evening they stppped at the table several times.  Very nice experience, I will go back whenever I'm in Big Bear.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Was gonna give them 3 stars because it's a bit pricey when comparing the quality/flavor of the food. Not that it's bad, but we all have our own pick of flavor for certain foods. They did serve some plates with pretty big portions, so I bumped them up to 4 stars for that! 🙌🏻 Their chip salsa was 🔥🔥🔥 Michelada mix needs some work, so if you're a huge Michi fan don't expect much. They have a full bar with plenty of TVs if you need to catch a game. Overall I'd say I'd definitely go back given what's available in Big Bear 😎</Text>

I ordered the shrimp taco combo and it was very bland, I'm Mexican and the food didn't have any flavor even the salsa wasn't spicy. My friend had the enchiladas and she said it tasted bland also. Too much cream on the tacos and the tortillas were not hot, first time and now last time.<//Text>

I have visited it 4 x and the food is average. Three of the times when it came to pay the bill .I paid with cash they dont give me back my coin. After the 2nd time I spoke to the manager. I made him aware of the issue. He said it's not a practice to do this .its been 10 months since my last visit.  Once again same thing they keep my change.  If you multiply it x every customer's bill ..????
The service was ok. I will pass. For multiple reasons.  There's other places I would encourage others to give their business.< /Text>

Good food. Chile Rellenos were really good as well as bean and cheese burrito. Chips were good too. A relaxing place to eat and enjoy your food.</Text>

Very expensive for any plate you order, and their enchiladas, while plated nicely, taste like they use canned cheap enchilada sauce. Greta chips and salsa while you wait tho!< /text>

The food was okay the service was horrible we arrived for taco Tuesday there were only about seven tables in the entire Place occupied it took 45 minutes to get our order placed another 15 or more before we received our food and the order was wrong I mean it was just tacos. The waitstaff apologized and said they were shorthanded in the kitchen but it seemed as though the problems at this place run just a little deeper. And it's a shame because it's a great atmosphere and I've had some really good meals there. My sister lives here and frequents this restaurant and his hat past experiences with less-than-stellar service to say the least. I like the place I went really like to see them step it up on the service level.</text>

The Hacienda Grill was a first-class experience from start to finish. The place is squeaky clean, comfortable, and relaxing. The staff is well trained and super friendly. The spices and flavor of the sauces were outstanding, distinctive but not overbearing. Their signature green tomatillo sauce in the chile verde was some of the best I’ve ever tasted, and I’ve tasted a lot!! Prices were reasonable considering the large portions, my leftovers will easily cover another meal. Can’t wait to try the carnitas torta on their lunch menu later this week! This place is a real treasure.< /Review>

<username>Beverly Enos</username><Time>1567098986236< /Time><Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Very nice & clean restaurant.  Thought it was odd that the host seating us could clearly see our name  badges for an AA conference insisted on sitting us in the "bar". I get it that he was striving to get us seated fast. I first said no.. but he insisted.. We were okay with it... as we were guests to the event. Not so sure how other AA people would have responded.
The food was good, but the waiter never checked on us again after taking our order because he had a big group that came in. We had to get up and go to the bar for our water refills. Also had to leave the bar (where they insisted on seating us) to go into the restaurant to dish and serve our own salsa to go with the chips. It was $40 for 2 people for a late lunch with no drinks.. just 2 meals. Substituted rice & beans for veggies cost an extra $2. Yet never disclosed. Just a weird experience. Maybe just an off day??<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c4b477dd6f3349:0x3b1ebbc1ca68ff6<//GmapID></record>

Best Mexican food on the mountain with a good bar. I’ve been here many times and the servers and bartenders are really nice and helpful. The parking is pretty good and the wait usually isn’t that bad for a table. Their beer selection is pretty good for big bear and the bartenders will describe the flavours well. The carne asada burritos are really good and I usually order that when I’m here<//review>

We showed up with a huge group on a Saturday and they found space for us, let us know the kitchen may struggle to keep up with our group and other large groups ahead of us but they would do their best. They did great. Food came out good and hot and timely. Our server Ilora handled our difficult and rowdy group like a champion and did an amazing job. Definitely a great place to go. Good outside seating options also if the weather is good.</review>

One of the rare occassions where I've had no complaints about an establishment whatsoever. The moment you walk in, the Hispanic culture that is the atmosphere grabs you and pulls you in, making you feel at home. The mood of the entire room is inviting you further and further as their art and food reels you into your seat. The service is top notch, and makes you feel as if they are delighted that you're eating there. The chips and salsa alone were almost enough to make me full, they were so fresh and delicious. Finally, my meal. The chicken, the rice, the veggies, were all so masterfully prepared on my dish that I felt that I was judging some sort of top chef competition. The taste was of everything was so perfect that I kept wanting more and more, and more, so much so I felt that I should just order an entirely new one for leftovers. This is absolutely one of the best restaurants available, anywhere.<//Text>

<text>If I could rate the service only it would’ve a zero,  as a local I was disappointed with the service as I wanted to have an enjoyable dinner with my neighbor,  we specifically stated what to omit on our order but to our surprise her order was all wrong, addressed the issue but it took forever, as the waitress only can to say “oh we are behind with orders” the establishment wasn’t even busy.  As i finished I felt bad that her order still didn’t make it to the table. So we boxed it, gentleman said u can keep the other one. But to my surprise we weren’t even compensated a discount for the long wait but we were charged extra for their mistake. Her excuse was “ well your taking it. So I left it. So please remove the charge. Waitress stated she couldn’t remove the extra charge. Friend asked to speak to the manager. Now there is no manager on duty. Appalled by their service. Food was so so. Never will I go back . From now on I’ll be eating at Sonora Cantina.</text>< username>

<review>The food was delicious, once it arrived. The wait to get our food was about 1 hour. Considering the restaurant was nearly empty I'm not sure why there was such a delay. They said that there were only 2 cooks on duty, but considering the lack of occupancy im not sure why that mattered.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This place is not worth the price!!! Chicken nuggets tasted like fish, didn't get a drink until my food came and then had a horriable time getting a refill. On top of that they added on an 18% tip, which was not stated on the menu and was not earned by the server for bad service. I won't be going back.</Text>

I was visiting big bear this past weekend for my birthday and we celebrated here. I normally am not a fan of Mexican food, but this place was delicious! The service was quick and there was always a someone nearby if you needed. They sang a cute birthday song and put a sombrero on my head. This is a fun restaurant!</review>

<time>1576625063397<//time><review>Food was mediocre at best. I ordered a tostada and it wasn’t a flour shell tostada like I’d envisioned. We had to ask for straws for our drinks multiple times and for a family of five they brought us one dinky salsa and one bowl of chips. The kids meals didn’t include drinks and they charged us for adding rice to their bean and cheese burritos. The kids said the tortillas were too tough to eat. Overall, terrible quality food for the price. They also charged us regular drink prices for smaller kids cups.< /review><GmapID>0x80c4b477dd6f3349:0x3b1ebbc1ca68ff6</GmapID>< user>

<Time>1557894671311< /Time><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Order was wrong.
Waited for right food to come.
I hadn't received food yet.
Waitress said you haven't received it yet then stated that they were behind in the kitchen.
Received food after friend done eating do just boxed it up.
Received bill and charged us for the chili relleno that was wrong.
I was appalled with this..
I stated I would of thought at least some type of discount on the bill.
I asked to speak to manager and stated no manager working.
So we just left..
Very upset..
Last time there it was wonderful. Boy did this experience put a damper on going there again..

<Review>I was visiting big bear this past weekend for my birthday and we celebrated here. I normally am not a fan of Mexican food, but this place was delicious! The service was quick and there was always a someone nearby if you needed. They sang a cute birthday song and put a sombrero on my head. This is a fun restaurant!<//Review><Name>Chenoa Wilson< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Bug crawling up table that my husband brushed off and didn't tell me about. After eating, I saw bug crawling across floor, pointed it out to waitress who told guy who helps waitresses. Guy came over and swept bug away. No employee said one word about the bug to us and they made no apology or offer to help compensate for bugs in restaurant. Can't go back again.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

We used to come here often, sometimes made the 2.5 hour drive to Big Bear with just their taco Tuesday in mind. Now, apparently, they don't have taco Tuesday. When I asked what is included in their happy hour, they didn't care to take 10 seconds to actually tell me, just "we have a happy hour menu". Great, thanks for nothing. We won't be back.< /Text>

<text>I used to enjoy their service; however, their service is not the same. When we arrived we asked for coffee it took them 15 minutes to bring we were told they had to brew it. I asked for only two shredded beef tacos was told they don't offer; however, if I wanted them each taco is $5 each?? Wow what kind of beef are they using to charge $5 per taco. Also we had to keep asking for things our server never once came back to ask us how we were doing. Only came back to drop off check as we were still eating. If you ask for water be prepared to only get one glass no refills and no refill on coffee. I even made sure to put my empty glass near the end of the table. I've never been to a place where when you ask for water they don't refill at least they usually make sure your water and coffee are full. Foods OK not the best salsa bar only had two to pick from. Probably will never return poor customer service.<//text>< pics>

We always enjoy ourselves here.  We called for reservations and were told they were booked for the evening.  When we got there the place wasn't crowded at all for the two hours we were there eating and drinking.  We felt they were trying to make out that there was hire demand than there was<//review>

My favorite casual spot in big bear. Good drinks. Consistently good food. I usually get the chicken taco salad,  or the fajitas and they're always good. And a good martini!< /review>

Never been to the famous sit down mexican restaurant in Bear before. It was lunch time so the service could have slowed down do to that. We ordered taco salads off of the lunch menu. One chicken (tasty) and one shredded beef (tasty) which were filling for the both of us. Their salsa bar is a plus. Perhaps next time I/We will order something less basic and really have a better review of their authenticity. Other than that, nice establishment all together.<//Review>

We shared a molcajete. It was ok except the carne asada was like rubber, the shrimp was wrapped in bacon, which I do not like, and we got tiny plates. The food kept falling off my plate so I asked for a large plate and I was given a slightly larger one, not a dinner plate. I probably would not go back.<//Review>

Must do the salsa... Everytime and always over indulge before the food gets there. Alisha is an awesome waitress, we happen to have her pleasant self every time we go in. The shrimp cocktail is unique and amazzzzing, stir it up good before you begin then dig into it's shrimpaliciousnes.<//Review>

This place was awful they charged my best friend 20.00 for nachos, she ordered carne asada on her nachos the waiter said there was an upcharge but he never told her there was a 5.00 up charge there were hardly any beans in her nachos so she asked for a side of beans and was charged for that. I ordered cheese enchiladas the cheese in my enchiladas were burnt the enchilada sauce taste like it came out of a can and it was full of grease it was awful. Our waiter was not very good either he should of explained how much of an upcharge it was for carne asada and then we shouldn't of been charged for beans when our nachos were supposed to come with beans and they were hardly any beans. This was our first time going to this restaurant and I think it's our last.< /review>

Despite the reviews my family and I decided to eat dinner here for our 1st night in big bear! BIG MISTAKE! The food was over priced for sorry taste! The food took over 25min and that there was not other people in the restaurant to get to our table we pretty much filled up on chips and salsa! Save your money! No Mexican flavor what so ever!</text>

<review>This beautifully appointed restaurant was a pleasant surprise for us. Excellent service and delicious Mexican food made for a great dinner. While we didn't have any alcoholic beverages, I had the horchata, we admired the margaritas served to a neighboring table.

Despite the reviews my family and I decided to eat dinner here for our 1st night in big bear! BIG MISTAKE! The food was over priced for sorry taste! The food took over 25min and that there was not other people in the restaurant to get to our table we pretty much filled up on chips and salsa! Save your money! No Mexican flavor what so ever!< /text>

I have been a loyal customer for many years and I have NEVER been disappointed! I send all of our guests, clients and family members here knowing that everybody will be well taken care of. The food is always fresh and consistent, the staff members are well versed in customer service, the owners are hands-on in the restaurant as well as the community and the building from top to bottom is CLEAN!!

We've been going there 6 times a year for the last 10 years. Before the remodeling food quality was the number one trait, the last four visits we were all disappointed, food didn't have the flavor or freshness.Sad,
losing our favorite restaurant in Big Bear to what seems as pre-prepared Mexican food. We'll give it one more try.</Text>

<gmapID>0x80c4b477dd6f3349:0x3b1ebbc1ca68ff6<//gmapID><Text>Food is okay. But the service is lacking.

Wait times for food are long. Two times in a row we tried to order take out. Both times the food took twice as long to be ready, but that was probably because they started making it when we showed up to pick it up. Both times the host had to come back multiple times to see what we ordered.

Even when we went there on a day it was slow to eat, the food took forever to come out. They just don't seem to care about customer satisfaction.

There are better places to eat up here.<//Text><Rating>2< /Rating>< pics>

<Review>As a Mexican restaurant, it's food have very little taste of Mexican food. No use of cumin or garlic, which a widely used spices and condiments  in Mexican food, rendering food practically tasteless, a can of Rosrita refried beans taste better. Very poor. Customer service. When existing the restaurant I asked for toothpicks, three people standing near the exit door and next to the cashier pointed to a little bowel containing one toothpick. They said, oh, there is one! We were four men in the party, what about if each one wanted a toothpick? The three people did not made any effort to refill the bowl bowl with toothpicks. Customer service is not just smile and pull chairs for customers. We spent $108.00 in lunch. Hey manager, pay more attention to details! Guess what? You won't see me in this restaurant anytime soon!< /Review>< username>

It took them awhile to give us chips
Our waitress stated she would bring chips. She did not. I asked a man in suit he stated he would. No luck no one brought the chips
The other tables got chips immediately. I am not going back.< /Text>

Generally a nice place but this time i thought that i was ripped off. First, i could not taste any alcohol in the fresh berry margarita. May as well have ordered a glass fruit punch. Although i paid $14 for that. A bit expensive for a cup of juce. Second. This was the first time ever that i was charged for soda water.< /Review>

Horrid! Not one single item was flavorful even the salsa. Found a strand of hair in my chips so they didnt even replace them. Service was bad, food was bad. I was in a party of 16 they tried squeezing us at a table too small for us all. Avoid this place! Food was terrible & over priced.</review>

Food had no flavor.  Place looked like it would have good food. But not the case and service below average. .Not a taste of Mexico!< /review>

<text>the service sucked. we had a waitress McKenzie and she didn’t really care about our table. We ordered and it literally took over and hour for our food to come out. At this point, we cancelled our order. She wasn’t empathetic at all that we wasted our time waiting for 4 plates of food. 0/10 would recommend. this place sucks.< /text>< pictures>

<user_id>115296093862498932325</user_id><review>Came Sunday around 7:15. No one at counter to greet us. Waited only a coooke minutes to be seated. Menu was filthy, sticky and debris on it. Chips came. No salsa. Asked for some and told self serve salsa bar. Should have said salsa was self serve when chips were served. Ordered an 18 ounce margarita that had no more than 12-15 ounces of liquid and no taste of alcohol. Food was like warm when served. Servers were having more fun talking and texting than serving clients. Never coming back here again.< /review><Date>1505099737828< /Date><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Good for lunch and dinner. Breakfast selection is slim but tasty. A sports bar atmosphere with televisions at every angle. I would eat there again.< /text>

<text>Food was good, but service sucked. We waited for at least 15 minutes to track down our waiter to take our drink order. Then he was rude when we asked about their beverages. He rushed us and barely check on us if we needed anything.</text>< pics>

Food is TERRIBLE! Went on a Saturday night, seated quickly but that's where the positive comments end. Waited a long time before we were greeted by our waitress, had to ask for forks, water.  Mexican Caesar salad didn't have dressing on it, had to ask. The Carne Asada was like beef jerky. Enchiladas lacked flavor. We spent $82 on one of the worst meals we've ever had. We couldn't get out if there fast enough.<//Review>

What a dump. I took a friend for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We walked into a crowded-feeling room that felt chaotic & unclean, with big-screen TVs visually screaming -- and at least one "actually" screaming -- on every wall in the place, not just in the bar. The booths were cramped. We both ordered flautas -- just an appetizer -- hers with grilled chicken & mine with carnitas, which wasn't on the menu but which they were able to accommodate. But they were dry & there wasn't enough topping; I had to buy an extra side of guacamole. We also each got a side of beans (didn't come with the meal, so paid extra) and a soda (THREE bucks each & we were not offered a refill). For this I paid 40 bucks, plus a tip. I couldn't believe it. Almost 50 dollars for dry flautas, 12 cents' worth of beans, and a couple of cokes in a seedy-feeling, noisy room. I'm still in shock. I'll NEVER go there again. Oh, & add another dollar sign to the two up there next to the restaurant name. I grew up in Southern California & have been eating Mexican food since I could eat solid food, & have had plenty of the real thing thanks to many Mexican friends whose moms are outstanding cooks, & I can tell you, this place wasn't even close. I've had way better Mexican food from little out-of-the-way places & street vendors. I'm going to miss that 50 bucks until the day I die. One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</Text>

The service was a bit lacking and our server had to be called over a couple of times. Food was good.</Text>

Avoid this place. My party waited 50 minutes to be seated, during which the waitress took a bribe from a group that jumped in front of the entire waiting lobby (The guy who bribed her even announced it.) Another group that showed up after us got tired of waiting, wandered over to an empty table, and were given menus immediately.

I told the staff and they did nothing.  I waited after my meal to speak with a manager and they simply didn't care. "That does not happen here" was their response.

I sent them an email afterwards and their reaponse was for me to come back and spend more money. No resolution or apology offered.

The food wasn't worth the price, and the drinks were warm.  I wish I hadn't gone here.</Text>

<Text>Food here was exquisite I liked and by far I can say close to the real authentic mexican dishes. They offer many mexican dishes, you can expect good service I came with a big group of people and all were served same time and food still warm. I end up disliking my food when it's cold.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Bad service. normal food, water filled cocktails except the michelada we got and more expensive than other mexican places which the experience does not make up for it.

I guess one of the customers had experience and told them to open a new tequila bottle for them.

The food is good, but it would be nice if there were silverware, napkins, salt & pepper on the table.  I usually have to go round up everything myself.  I do not enjoy that, as I was a server for many years and think the staff is rather lazy. I ordered a Lava Flow like they serve at El Jacalito and are delicious, but Hacienda Grill's are the worst.  They need to learn how to SERVE people and be on top of their game.<//review>< Pics>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>This place has the worst service. We had a party of 17, so we knew it would be a while to seat us. After an hour, and after 2 failed attempts we had to sit in different tables. So we split the parties, our first group got their food in about 20 mins or so, however our second group after an hour waiting, finally decided to leave. The waitress Makenzie and the manager never apologized or gave us an explanation of why the long wait for the food. They failed to explain why our first party received their order within 20 minutes, and why after an hour we still haven’t received ours. 0 stars to the manager and to the waitress, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. WORST SERVICE EVER.< /review><Rate>1</Rate>< resp>

Decent place, friendly, attentive, not much bang for your buck on the food.  Maragritas are great so 3 stars it is..

Chips n salsa yum, main course was just blah, rice had no flavor and was not warm, fajitas trio gave me like 4ozs of meat..Desserts were terrible as well.

Maybe next year...< /review>

We were visiting from the LA area and had dinner here and I'm sorry but it was horrible. Food had no flavor...the fajitas were dry..our salad which usually comes before the main course came after it. Enchilada sauce was bland and rice needs flavor and salt. Will not return.< /Text>

Omg! I placed a carryout order tonight. I was never informed by phone they didn't have white cheese sauce, until picking up food. They don't know the difference between shredded vs ground. Staff not friendly when i picking up food. There was two more things. I will not go back!</Text>

<Text>Nice scenery, okay food, HORRIBLE service, absolutely terrible workers, i will never be back, and if anyone asks about it i will gladly let them know. I’m not sure if that’s how the day crew is as well but they need a whole new night staff for sure.<//Text><rating>1</rating><resp>None<//resp><UserId.>109189094224373104838< /UserId.>< name>

Food was ok. The service was horrible. The waitresses was inattentive. She then brings the check before I'm even done eating or finished my beer. She was extremely rude and passive aggressive.</text>

Two kids, three adults for lunch was $86, $100 with tip. I ordered a southwestern salad with chicken. Good thing I added chicken otherwise it would have been the most expensive lettuce I ever bought. Aside from the chicken add on, it had three slices of cucumber, three slices of tomato, some tortilla strips and little cheese. At $15, way overpriced. Guacamole was $9 and FULL of tomatoes. Anyone who loves guac knows that's the Cardinal sin. Because of the overload of tomatoes it was runnier than it should have been and lacked flavor. Son's chicken taco was dry as a bone. Both son's said the beens and rice were good. The other two adults I was with ordered burritos. The carnitas was dry. The chili verde was good. Server was good but rushed. Slow down when you approach your tables, run when you're not at the tables. Decor was nice. They have a serve yourself salsa bar. Not a fan as I feel it's one less thing they need to serve you so really your doing their job. I'm not sitting in a restaurant to keep getting up to serve myself, especially at this price. Won't be going back. BTW, in my career I've been the purchasing manager for foodservice distributors so I know how much food costs are, also managed restaurants in high school and while going to college, and for what you get, not pleased.</Text>

<text>can't say anything about the food....we never got to taste it.  we waited at the front podium/check in stand for about 20 minutes and were 100% avoided by the staff.  NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED....and there we about 15 people in line behind us too!  I don't know what the problem was that night but it took 20minutes of several people trying to get someone's attention to get on the list, only to be told it is a 1-1.5 hr wait.....I guess they dint care about getting or keeping customers.   Their lose was our gain....we found a great little mom&pop mex place tucked in a hidden spot in the village....(LaBamba - highly recommend)</text><gmapID>0x80c4b477dd6f3349:0x3b1ebbc1ca68ff6< /gmapID>< name>

Almost perfect. If you love mexican food as much as you should, this place is for you. The bar is as well run as any I've ever seen. The tamales and rellenos are perfection. the salsa bar has plenty of choices. the wait staff are very good and fast enough. They have been overrun with too many customers at one time but our food still came out hot and on time. We learned to go here super late afternoon, when they were not ultra busy. TVs are not too loud (I like that). Prices are spot on. Just where you expect them to be for top quality food and service. Bar prices are good too. If I could change one thing here it would be to remove the wall of crosses. You will see what I mean when you get there. Not needed. The rest of the decorations are great. You can tell they spent GOOD money on the remodel. Hacienda is very clean with a big city feel and a small town charm. Enjoy.</review>

Ordered carne asada.  Tasteless.  If the town locals like this they don't know real tasty seasoned Mexican food!    Pollo loco is better.  Where are the spices, garlic, cilantro, onions, green chili, salt, pepper????  Tasteless!

Owner ,  unlocked the spice rack and let the flavor/ sabor out!!!!!   I will not eat their until I can actually smell the spices!     SABOR = spices , marinades ....</text>

Big mistake letting bar tender Mike go. Us locals are now going to boycott your restaurant. No more taco Tuesday is big mistake. New manager sucks.</Text>

What can I say, we paid $18.00 for a chimichanga!  By the time they charged us for upgrading from a burrito to a chimi, side of sour cream, side of guacamole, extra sauce and some lettuce. Yes they charged fir each and every one of these! Guac I understand but lettuce! What restaraunt charges for lettuce!?  They have all you can eat salsa bar, but charge you for extra enchilada sauce!  Letting the assistant manager know of our displeasure he became very rude and loud and argumentative.  The manager came out and he was no help either.  Very bad experience. Will never eat at this place again.  Food was just Ok.<//text>

Great location, friendly staff, and pet-friendly! I wish their food was better so that I could give it 5 stars... at least they give you unlimited tortilla chips & salsa.  I had chosen this place on the fact alone that they offer a doggy-patio. I ordered the combo plate with a cheese enchilada, which was delicious... hard to screw up... along with a carne asada taco. The rice and black beans were perfect but the carne asada in the taco was so bland and overcooked, I couldn't enjoy my full meal. Something didn't sit right with me either because I had to use the restroom soon afterwards... as well as my husband :/ I will try this place again when I come to visit Big Bear again but I will definitely NOT order anything with carne asada.< /text>

< review>
Most of the food was good or great. Unfortunately what I ordered was just bad. The service here was horrible. Some of the staff did a good job, others were just inexcusably unprofessional. We arrived with a large party of 15 people on a Wednesday. I understand that this can overwhelm the staff and we were all willing to cut them some serious slack. Unfortunately it quickly became apparent that no amount of slack would be sufficient. We were at our tables for 25 minutes before drink orders were taken. Refills were haphazard and communication was horrible. I had to go hunting through the restaurant to discover there was a salsa bar. The salsa was amazing. When the initial wave of food showed up after 80 minutes it was delicious. I got to sample the food of everyone around me because, inexplicably, my tortilla soup didn't arrive until everyone had finished their meals. Five of us ordered the tortilla soup and when it finally arrived it looked like I was in for a really good meal. I was dumbfounded to find that it was bland and entirely lacking in character. Everyone who ordered the soup agreed and didn't eat it. Someone messed up on the soup. That is the only explanation. I brought this to the attention of the server and made sure to tell him that the rest of the food was great. I suggested that we really shouldn't pay for it. He gave me a slack jaw look and found an excuse to talk to someone else. When I pressed the point he argued with me about that I said it was ok. I still don't know what the heck he was smoking there. When he finally split the checks (more arguing there) he only took off my soup and left the other 4 on. I was so angry my family refused to let me make a big deal about it. They all told me to write a review instead. There was plenty of additional drama and by the time it was over we all had a very bad taste in our mouth. Ironically not from the food. If you go to this restaurant please don't be silent. They are on the verge of being great. They just need to train their staff about basic restaurant practices and nothing will change unless you speak up.< /review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The service is not very good I do not know if it is due to the current situation there is no control over how to handle customers there is a lot of confusion
But the food I give a 5 stars. The hamburger I ordered was very tasty and the fries were delicious. ...
Could return without a doubt

(Original)
El servicio no está muy bien no se si sea debido a la situación actual no hay control sobre como manejar a los clientes hay mucha confusión
Pero la comida le doy un 5 estrellas la hamburguesa que ordene estaba muy sabrosa y las papitas buenísimas. ...
Podrían regresar sin duda<//Review>
