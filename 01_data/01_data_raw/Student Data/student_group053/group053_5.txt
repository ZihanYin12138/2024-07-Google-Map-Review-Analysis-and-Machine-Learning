My soon is 12 and I been coming here way before that Jerry is a reasonable person who gives you reasonable prices. I have brought customers here from the average Joe to lausd cops and they have all been treated with respect. This place is always crowded and its for a reason, the wait is worth the while<//text>

Went in for some brand new set of 4 tires. I called 6 tire shops no one had my size 255 35 20. J&J tires did,  Alberto was the one that helped me first thing in the morning.  Great person. He took care of my wheels making sure he didn't scratch them and showed me how new tires would look on my car.  Plus the shin them up for me.  A huge plus.  I'm coming here in the future.</review>

< Review>
They take cash and card, a good selection of tires the used tires they sell are good quality and the new tires prices are very good I got four new tires for $260 and the guy installed them quickly. They don't have an alignment machine but I'm sure they send you to another location for that if you ask. The place is a little small and gets busy so plan for that. They are very friendly people they do a good job. Please don't be a n a hole  tip the guys working on your car they really appreciate it.<//Review>

I'm editing this review after I spoke with Jerry on the phone. Originally I had a negative review as my wheels were not treated with the proper car they should've. From being out of balance, to scratches, to missing my valve stem caps, I was not too happy with the service especially because I trusted them in the past. Jerry was extremely quick to reach out to my review and make things right. He assured me he will stay on top of his employees and make sure my experience doesn't happen to anyone else. Strictly for how passionate and helpful Jerry was, I'm coming back to rewrite my thoughts that people make mistakes, and although some are much worse then others, what's important is that things can be made right, which in this case definitely did. This tire shop has won back my service as there customer service was above all else. Thank you!< /review>

Make up prices on the spot. Terrible parking. Terrible "customer service".... if you could even call it that.  Definitely dont recommend this place to anyone. Go to literally any other place.

I was at different tire shop waiting and waiting, so I decided to check google for any other nearby tire shops, this one J&J comes up and with great reviews so I jump on my car and came here. This place has great reviews for a reason, didn’t wait like 2 minutes and one technician had my tire off the car already. This place is awesome don’t waste your time and money going somewhere else.</text>

Hit a pothole last night and popped my tire. Showed up at J & J without appointment. Not only did they have my tire in stock, but they also rotated my tires for free. Job was done in about 5 minutes. Everyone was nice and professional. Great customer service. They were recommended to us by our AAA tow truck driver. Super affordable. Definitely recommend coming here!<//review>

< review>
The best tire shops in the valley, great customer service, friendly staff, very helpful, and best prices and deals in town.  Jerry at the tire shop in Van Nuys  is an excellent leader of these family business, and I'm grateful to him for providing the best service each time I go.  He has taken care of several of my vehicles, friends and family vehicles too. His brothers are very helpful and friendly as well. Thank you!</review>

First time here, I bought a set of tires for my civic si and I’m really happy with the service. I called around and they had the best prices. I’m really picky and I asked them if they could be careful and not scratch my rims, they did a really good job and didn’t put any marks on them. The guys here are all pretty cool, I will definitely come back whenever I need tires and I recommend shopping with them when you need tires.
Great prices and great service 👍🏼< /review>

Great staff! They do a great job at a way better price then any tire shop I've been at.
I go here for all 20+ of my vehicles in my fleet, plus recommend all my family and friends here. They patch tires, sent rims to get fix, and offer great new tires without breaking the bank. Thanks Jerry & Jorge for all your help these past few years.< /review>

1st time buying brand new tires, and I shopped around. Finally, came across J&J Tires, and contacted them via thier chat feature,  got a quick response and they quoted me a wayyy more reasonable price. I jumped in my car, and headed over.  As soon as I pulled up we were attended, very friendly service! In and out in 20 mins, and if you ask me that pretty awesome! 4 tire installment in 20 mins. Pretty fast service! Thank you sooo much J&J tires! I'll definitely be recommending you all, and be returning for future tire needs!< /text>

<text>Cheap and fast, but you get what you pay for.

Brought it back twice because the vibration was bad at 70 mph. Not sure what kind of balancer they use.

I brought it to a shop with a modern digital balancer and it fixed the issue.< /text>< userid>

The best prices for Run Flat Tires, only 20 minutes away from Bel Air (25 minutes from Beverly Hills) during mid-afternoon weekend traffic.

We bought four Used run-flat tires that were not very used at all!
The tires are run flat Continentals and perform magnificently on our S63 AMG.< /Review>

Fast and Great service. They have the best Tires used or new and PRICES around. I highly recommend that J&J’s tire be your first stop when in the market for new or used tires. They have bilingual service(english or spanish) and will help you find the right tire and price for you. I give them 5 stars and is the reason why my family and I have been coming to them for years!<//review>

Great speedy service, clean place. They always offer to check the air in all tires for you and yes even the spare. Great deal on take off's. I got some MICHELIN tires reg 180 each, slightly used maybe 1000 miles for 300 These guys get you in and out never pressure sell, explain your options. If your low on cash, take offs, used or just cheep new or even the expensive at a good / Fair price go see Jerry the manager. they have an other location close to here that can take care of you too.</Text>

Had a nail in my tire for sure, so I yelped the nearest open tire shop, it was Sunday and a three day weekend! Thank you for being open!!

I called first and they told me I could swing by.

Parked inside and was greeted by a very nice young man, I told him if it could be fixed that would be great for $10, that's awesome!
If not I would buy a used tire for now.
He walked away and another older man came, with an attitude...
Not going to get into why, but it was mostly due to me asking him if it could be patched.
Without even looking at the tire he said no, I needed a tire, $35, $45 or $55

I said ok to. $35.

When he left the young man told me he would be able to patch it.
Wow thanks for not lying and trying to charge me for something I didn't need.
Geeeeezzz.

Honesty is #1. I paid the $10 and gave him a $12 tip.
Thanks again!< /text>

People are kind of friendly, expensive price for the used tire $50 for each tire. I bought 4 on Sep 10 and on Sep 11 morning I found one tire flat, had tough time at work. There was a hole in the tire. Can't believe they sell tire that has hole in it. I took tire back to the shop and they fix it. They apologize for selling tire with a hole in it and I will see how good job they did. More to come!!!< /text>

My brothers referred me to J & J's, we live in the neighborhood. These guys are no-nonsense, really, really inexpensive, and always busy, a sign of competence in my book. Don't look for a lounge or place to sit because you won't wait that long, err, sometimes. Tip the poor guy that helps you, its that cheap!< /Review>

<Review>Fast Service, Excellent Prices, and Great Work!!!
My first visit there was yesterday, March 5th, 2018, as recommended by Blumer Automotive Center in Pacoima.  I went in to have a flat tire replaced on my SUV. They were working on my car within 10 minutes of my arrival. I ended up purchasing 3 new tires (as two other tires were reaching their end of life). The tires were mounted, balanced, and installed in less than 20 minutes.  After leaving their shop I drove my vehicle on the freeway and there was no tire bounce...the tires were balanced perfectly!
I will definitely return to "J & J" for my future tire needs and I thank Blumer Auto Center for sending me to them. 😁</Review>< pics>

Nicely done and very friendly.  I spent over $250 that day between tips and services and within less then 12 hours one of my nails broke.  I went back to the shop 4 times to get it fixed because I have a wedding to attend too and each time they were too busy.  So I set up to come back first thing Saturday when they opened and of course when I come none of the 4 Technicians that were there supposedly so not do nails. So I’d have to wait until the original lady decided  to come in.  This is the WORST customer service I have ever received at a mail salon.  I will never return and would advise anyone else no too come.</Review>< pictures>

I gave it to them not realizing i couldnt get ANY money without it! So a few days later i bought a visa prepaid card and paid it over the phone and i was not able to get my card for almost another week but when i went there to get it i was told they don't have it there anymore and that i never paid and I wont get my ID unless i pay again and it was 230 and 3 of my nails broke off the next day. I honestly didn't care for them as soon as I got them.

I do not know how to upload a picture of my nail onto here. But worst experience I’ve ever gotten. My acrylic nails were legit wavy, the length was all different and asked for coffin and got basically square. What ever you do. Stay as far away from this place as you can</review>

<Review>The nail technicians were really nice and i feel bad for giving them 1 star because they were really kind. In my opinion this place over charges on the work they do. I asked for coffin shape and that was not accomplished my nails are uneven in length shape and thickness of acrylic. My daughters nails are also not done too good. I just moved up here from sd and was in search of a nail shop first time here and i dont think I'll be back. Paid over 230$ for the both of us and i really hate the way our nails look and im not one to give technicians a hard time. i just wont go back.< /Review>< pics>

<GmapID>0x80dc829dafad973d:0x8a3370978789b3ea< /GmapID><review>My daughter had gotten her nails done here for her 16th bday party that day and they looked horrendous.  They told her they looked that way because she had gotten nail polish instead of gel.  When she complained they just kept adding coats so she ended up with 5 coats of polish.  We went back the following day and after a lot of back and forth and arguing we had her acrylic nails removed and got our money back.  They were so rude and tried to charge me money to take them off.  It was ridiculous and absolutely unprofessional and deserved a 0 star review.<//review><userid>114213501652464475111</userid></record>

<text>I tried this new spot since it’s closer to my house instead of going to my normal nail salon. -my first mistake. The woman who started working in my nails was not wearing a mask for starters. Her equipment kept shutting off and not working probably. I explained to her numerous times I wanted dip powder not gel. Then she tried to paint my nails. Told her no and left. Never coming here again.</text><user>103562083385087785913</user>< username>

The owner of the business saw that one of her employees did a horrible job on my wife's nails. Not only did she not do anything about it, she charged the full price. Avoid this salon at all costs. A few weeks prior I brought my daughter there to get her nails done. The same thing happened! Poor service and unacceptable quality of the nail service. Avoid at all cost.<//Text>

I am completely appalled with my pedicure after two weeks I got some sort of  fungis from this establishment, after paying $75 for my manicure and pedicure. I went in this morning to let them know something was wrong and they tryd to tell me that it was from socks( I only wear sandles at this time) and that I just needed new polish!  I then went to a new place and was told they would treat my fungis and give me a new pedicure because orchard had used bad quality gel. because it shouldn't have turned that color after two weeks.<//text>

Amazing service!!! The staff are so kind and dedicated to making sure your nails, toes, or eyebrows look amazing! I got my nails filled today and am so beyond happy with how they turned out! I’m always so happy with how my nails turn out here and with how my toes have turned out when I do get them done. My nails/toes are complicated to do because they don’t really match the standard sets they usually have, but they always look amazing!< /review>

<text>I went there on Sunday instead of my normal salon because I was being a bit lazy. I’ve been there a time or two before, but not for well over three years. So, I figured what the heck much closer than my normal place. I only needed a fill. They took me in and started my nails. One of the first things that struck me weird, he didn’t even cut off the old acrylic where it was lifting. Nor did he use the nail drill to take off the old nail under the acrylic. I know not all places do the same thing so that didn’t bother me too badly. So here we are days later and one nail broke three days after the fill. Now a second one is cracked because the acrylic is sooooo thin. As I look at my nails I see bumps and uneven acrylic. Not to mention they wanted to charge me $30 for the fill. Until I said “Wow, for an acrylic fill” they dropped the price to $27. They said because I had long nails, even after I had them trimmed down. Now I remember why I stopped going. I should have stayed away like my gut and the reviews told me to.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Went to this salon for the first time yesterday for a full set. I was highly disappointed. My nail technician didn’t know what she was doing she totally butchered my acrylic putting dents and uneven acrylic on each nail! I had to tell her repeatedly to fix it. Then she had an elderly man put my polish on which my little 8 yr old would have done a better job. I will never go back there it was a waste of time and money. They clearly don’t have the talent nor do they have any business doing nails.< /text>

<text>If I could give them a 0 I would. Absolutely terrible customer service. Went in to get my nails done the lady messed up on my toes I had her fix it and it continued to do the same thing. Girl who did my nails was nice but two days after getting them done they bubbled up and started peeling off. I went in to get them fixed and they told me not to use the same
Color because it would continue to bubble and had be pick a different one. Prior to that I told them I wanted my nails and toes to match and they said they’ll fix them both free of charge. So she continued to do my nails in the different color. After my nails were completely done they told me they weren’t going to do my toes. I told them they already said they were going to fix it and they said well we have to charge you for it.. they were VERY rude and treated me like I was stupid. Will not be returning terrible staff.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dc829dafad973d:0x8a3370978789b3ea<//Gmap_id></record>

They are very nice but the quality of service is poor. I had my eyebrows waxed, I expected an exceptional outcome considering it took like 30 mins to do including my lip and cheeks.  I also had a nail fill and they were not what I wanted. I asked for an extra coating of gel and was told I was only allowed one coat.  I definitely will not go back to this place, ever.  Please get your moneys worth somewhere else.</review>

I’ve lived in the area for almost two years and never really had a complaint about this location until now. I’m not sure if they changed ownership or what happened because none of the same employees are there. Terrible job! I went in asking for gel manicure and pedicure and I’m assuming the lady doing my pedicure was in a hurry to leave because she assumed I wanted just a regular pedicure and the color didn’t even match my nails and the man doing my manicure cut my finger with the nail file. I explained to the manager that the colors didn’t match and that I wanted a gel pedicure. She offered to fix it and after she did, they looked better. However, I never had these issues before.<//text>

<Text>Employees really care about the giving you the nails you want and take pride in their work. Very kind and patient. They only thing keeping this from a 5 star is color selection and gel nail extensions. The closest they do is dipped nails and they always use tips.< /Text>< time>

<review>SO MAD!
I chose the callus removed pedicure. The water was COLD, the lady didn't ask if I wanted a flower and the paint is glopped onto my toe nails, AND she had me out of my seat to pay immediately after she finished, without letting my nails dry!!!! So I'm at home with sloppy wet toe nails !!!! So upset I chose convenience!< /review>< pics>

I wish I had read the reviews before going here. I cannot believe how bad my nails are. I didn't pay much attention to my toes until I got home and WOW, my 5 year old could have done better for me SO BAD. They were not attentive, if I knew what they were saying I could tell you what drama they were having that day, and they didn't know what they were doing- And prices were HIGH. I cannot believe I paid for this, all I wanted was to get OUT of there!<//Review>

<review>This shop is the worst possible, do not waste your time or money. I walked in the shop prior to 6 and I immediately asked if they had time for a fill and pedicure. They said yes of course, as I was sitting down to start the pedicure, the woman that usually does my nails, looked at my nails, asked me if I picked a color, and said she would be back. Another woman walked in and asked for a manicure, to which she took her immediately and started her nails.  I never complained. I just got my pedicure.   Then I waited, and waited, and waited ; after 30 mins, she turns to me and says it's too late, can you come back tomorrow?  My toes are purple, and my hands are baby blue. Horrible service, and now I'm embarrassed, and I have to go elsewhere to finish the job.< /review>< Rating>

Please, Please, Please.....never go to this Nail Salon!! I took my pregnant niece here as a gift for her Gender Reveal Party, she got a mani pedi and she got a toe fungus from the gel or tools being contaminated!! Don't let the appearance of the salon fool you!! It was very nice but no customers were present!! She went in to talk to the manager and they did nothing to try to help her except make up excuses as to why her toes look the way they did!!  Take it from us....PLEASE DO NOT RISK YOUR HEALTH!! Thank You!!<//Review>

<Text>I absolutely hate acrylics but my natural nails broke and I had an event to go to. I came here to get them done and the lady did an okay job. I requested almond shape and she did them oval. I tried to tell her that I wanted the tips slightly more pointed and she raised her voice at me saying she did almond shape like I asked. Another problem was that none of my nails were the same oval/almond shape. Some were more narrow, some were more round and some were even crooked. The acrylic close to my cuticles were very clumpy and not smooth. Even with all that, I would have given them 3 stars, buuuuut....
I made the mistake of coming back here to have the acrylics removed after the event. My natural nails had a decent length (1/8 inch past fingertips) so I asked to have the acrylics removed and get a gel polish manicure. Well the woman grinded off the thickness of the nails as I expected, then started tearing off the rest! LAYERS of my natural nails came off with the acrylics and it was very painful as I expressed throughout the service. I asked why not soak them in a solution to soften it first and she said they don't do that. Needless to say, I had NO natural nails left! The entire length is gone and they are paper thin. Not to mention throbbing!!! I understand acrylics will weaken nails but this was too much. I could have removed them like this at home, but I went to a professional establishment so there would be as little damage as possible. The gel polish was also done very poorly. I chose a light natural pink color since I did not want to bring attention to the nubs that are now left on my fingertips. The polish is all over my cuticles and even the sides of my fingers.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, the manicure water I soaked my hands is was ice cold (which with the throbbing was actually soothing, but not acceptable for normal manicure). When she was finally done I mentioned to the lady at the front that I was not happy, in pain and very unpleased with the service provided. She said nothing was done wrong but she gave me a whopping $3 off to compensate.
Do yourself a favor and save your nails by going somewhere else.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Worst gel polish of my life! Less than 5 hours after getting my nails done the polish is peeling and bubbling. Should have know it wasn't going to be good when a lady comes in complaining about her nails while I'm there. The man who did my nails paints like a three year old (sorry to all the 3 year olds out there. ....you'd probably do a better job). I had to take over the nail file and do it myself since he couldn't even do that. Save your time and money and don't  bother going.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

During a pandemic when all was going great and I was doing what was required and had not 1 problem,  you are now failing! You cannot use the excuse that people do not know how to do simple basic things, because , I like many others are highly intelligent and know how this works.  This failure is all on you!!!! Your system must be so antiquated exactly where does the tax money go in this state?? Also you are holding up FEDERAL unemployment because of your incompetence!!! Shameful but of course if it has to do with the people the government just does not invest does it??? Now when I get calls from The electric, gas, water I will give them your number !!!<//Text>

< Review>
So I walked in and was simply looking to get some type of help"That didn't go nowhere.Today 4/28/2021 it was about 12:00pm Their way this lady at the front desk who simply didn't wanna move a finger to help others.I thought that was her job.She had glasses, dark hair, pale light skin short on heights.She was basically a security, but they already one at the entrance.
I asked her if she knew anything about what was going on and she said it wasn't her job to know what was going on as far as EDD goes"Seemed like she wanted to just sit their and do nothing else.Waste of time going their.< /Review>

If you need to get in contact with the disability office I recommend you come here instead of calling the numbers they give you. They will never answer and it’s just a waste of time. I came to this office because I couldn’t get a hold of a disability representative. They lady’s at this office are really helpful and they put me on a  Direct  line With a representative. Now, the lady I spoke to on the phone was a little rude but at least I got the information I need.< /text>

I felt like my career coach didn't even try to help me, everytime i tried to contact her she would take forever to respond or didn't respond at all, I felt like I had to beg for help. I have worked 20+ yrs none stop and never asked for no public assistance and never used edd services unfortunately I got laid off and had to go through this process where I feel like they belittle you just because you have no job, Do not rely on this office to help you out with anything! very bad service!</text>

Why have phones if they never answer, i called to check on whats going on with my benefits and when I finally get to speak to am actually human, not the animated phone, they put me with some technical guy that only has info about the website. Point being its best to just go in person.< /text>

<Text>This is another one of my favorite stops along US 395.

There's a few spots for semis to park and take your break add room for the cars to get fuel.

I don't see any place for trucks to get fuel but the parking is good and it's well located and directly off the highway.

The store is well-stocked and the sandwich shop is top-notch! :-)<//Text>< pictures>

A great stop along 295 between Reno and Susanville.  There is a really nice deli, and their pizza is a local favorite.  Gas up, get Diesel, or fill up your propane tank if you need to.< /Review>

EZ to find at night - look for the strobe light.  Great for truckers & RVs to pull off for a quick stop either north or south bound.  Northbound travelers can easily use the median lane to merge into traffic.  Hot food case.  My favorite is the cream cheese stuffed jalapeño stuffers - they don't skimp on the cheese!<//Text>

Verified Hotel Guest<//user_name>

<Text>Positive: The availability of a kitchen attracted us to choose this hotel. Nice kitchen with all the necessary appliances except for a dishwasher.  The front office person was very attentive to our needs and complaints regarding the status of the kitchen. Negative: The kitchen was not stocked with paper towels, or cloth towels, or a trash can or basics such as dish washing soap. It did not appear properly sanitized as we found a wood spoon in the sink that had been used and left with some food material on it.</Text>< Rating>

<Text>Positive: Large room, comfortable beds, quiet, good internet connection. Easy beach access.  The kitchen has a huge refrigerator, standard size range,oven,microwave. Smelled good. Light blocking drapes, clear tv receptions, good towels.  I highly recommend this pla Negative: The kitchen's cooking supplies, and silverware needs to be resupplied.< /Text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This motel has been here for as long as I can remember but it's only been until recently that I've stayed at this decent establishment. I don't have too many negative things to say about The Viking. However, the important things were all in place!!! That's a very nice change compared to recent experiences!!
Important to me:
Cleanliness
Adequate basics supplied, i.e.:
Towels
T.p.
Soap
Functional appliances
The management were really nice too!!

In short, I would recommend The Viking motel!!!<//text>< Pictures>

From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I felt the hospitability of the people here. The staff were also very helpful and pleasant to deal with, the facilities were excellent, and the location was perfect for accessing the best spots for tourism. For all of the reasons above, I sincerely recommend this hotel.< /Text>

<text>First of all the place was empty and I didnt get the room I payed for... The guy working at the front desk couldn't give me a reason why! Then he tells me there is a $100 deposit which I couldn't find anywhere on the website! And to top it off he told me that I was not allowed to have any guest or smoke in the room or else I wouldn't get my deposit back! Oh and if I messed up the other bed I also wouldn't get my deposit back?? Like what the heck. The place smelled horrible, stains on the bed and chairs. What a dump<//text>< Gmap_id>

This hotel has all the charm of a California 60's hotel with the bonus of updated amenities!

We were treated to a kitchen suite with a full-sized refrigerator and gas stove/oven. The room was spacious and the bathroom was better than most 4 star hotels with beautiful new tile work.

Though on a busy street, the room was quiet. Housekeeping was outstanding and the room was very clean. The manager was very attentive and helpful.

A major drawback to our vacation was our dog getting hit by a car. Patrick (the manager) was amazing by helping her and then locating a vet hospital for us. He helped us arrange for a longer stay to accommodate for her surgery and continued to check on her daily.

A big thanks to everyone at Viking Motel!<//Review>

<review>Person at front desk was rude, demanded 100 cash deposit, due to my service animal, repeatedly mentioned that the room better be left clean or I’d loose my deposit. Also no telephone in room hot water only lasted 5 mins. I took pics of room when I checked in and when I checked out..

<user>105487677785891878130< /user><text>I'm giving 5 stars because the check in was quick and easy and the remodeled room was amazing. Normally I would deduct a point or 2 for the location and the drug deals going down in the alley behind the motel but the room deserves 5 stars! The main room was huge. My bed was very comfortable and LOTS of TV channels. The kitchen is just about as nice as my kitchen at home! Nice 5 burner gas stove with over-the-stove microwave oven, 2 door SS refrigerator with water and ice in the door. Even a toaster oven! GREAT walk-in shower with 2 overhead rain shower heads, half a dozen body water jets and a hand held wand all surrounded by beautiful tile work. The room is actually nicer than the room I was in at the Hyatt a few weeks ago! Too bad they have full time residents screwing up any chance of a good reputation. I'll go back by myself but unfortunately I would not bring my family here until/unless they take out the trash.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80e9ad228b3bd777:0x4c2d2da679662870< /Gmap_id>< username>

<Text>Theft & absolutely unconscionable, predatory business practices!!!I made this reservation from the side of the road in the night, using my phone on the Expedia website, exhausted from driving, w 5 children. The reservation was placed after midnight, July 6, 2019. For July 6 check in - July 7 check out.After placing the reservation I drove directly to the hotel, arriving within twenty minutes. Prepaid $188.When I arrived, the clerk told me that I could not check in until 3:00 p.m.! I told him we were driving, there was an accident, road closed, delayed, exhausted, need room for tonight only on our way to San Diego, but couldnt make it. Clerk informed me that he would charge me $400 as it was Saturday night & that was the Saturday night rateClearly, no one was going to come in after 2:30 a.m. w a party of 6 to rent a room for a few hours.I teared & said that I could not afford that. He offered 300 price range. I told him I could not afford that either.I asked him to please refund my money!He told me I did not read the small print & it was my fault.I told him I did not see that on the app at all. That the room had only been reserved for twenty minutes it could not have cost him any business.He told me to contact Expedia.I was turned away, mother traveling solo w 5 children in the middle of the night, in tears, with no assistance, and no offer to direct me to another motel. Unconscionable! Rodeway Inn took us in w courtesy, hospitality, respect & compassion, fair pric</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I NEVER write bad reviews, but this has been the WORST experience I have ever had. I used to come to this establishment a couple years ago and felt safe, clean and the staff was so friendly. NOT ANYMORE!! The little boy in the front was very rude and they charged me a $100 dollar deposit which I understand  but then the boy goes and says he over booked a room and I needed to pay extra for a different room ultimately I had to pay a whole extra $50 for a room I didnt even book. Which may not seem like a lot but if you're coming from out of town and you booked something and go to stay in a room and have to wait all day long just two be overcharged money that I was lucky I had but then to be turned away at the end of it because I was using a debit card instead of a credit card.

Management is very accommodating.   Full kitchens are awesome.    Spacious rooms.   A little pricey for an older hotel but I guess the kitchens make it worth it.</Review>

<review>Unprofessional business practices. Dirty property. Extremely rude staff. Left immediately upon arrival. Did not actually stay as this property. The managment team is worse than the property - they should not be in business. (I highly recommend staying at motel 6 with kind staff and clean rooms for less expensive rates and closer to the water.)< /review><rating>None<//rating><Date>1565308800000</Date></record>

The shower was seriously THE BEST shower I've ever used in a hotel or at a resort. The kitchen was clean and beautifully remodeled. The owner was so friendly and genuine. I would definitely recommend this especially for people traveling with kids or if you are like us and like to bring/prepare your own food. I was concerned that there would be road noise at night but you could have heard a pin drop it was so quiet. We will definitely be back.
It's hard to say anything negative because we really liked it, but the parking was very tight. Fortunately we have a small car but I almost backed into a large truck and i had barely moved from my spot. If you have a large SUV or Truck you may want to call the motel ahead of booking to make sure there will be a spot for your vehicle.
The only other thing is it seems like it may be occupied by more people living there on a long term basis than vacationers. Wasn't an issue for us because it was very quiet and clean and the owner (female of married couple) was so sweet and friendly.</text>

<Review>The employees are rude, out dated rooms . my mom dropped her dog off a few hours before check out so she could make it ti her Dr appointment and they charged me $100 with out telling me first. When there was never a pet fee notice online, in the office or no employee informed me. So a warning would have been nice before they charged my card. I highly regret not have just staying with my safe choice and gone with the Vagabond down the street. Nice clean rooms and better customer service. I will not be going back to this motel.</Review>< pics>

I stay in a different room each time, and each one is uniquely different but always immaculate,  and the MOST comfortable memory foam mattress on the bed makes for a very restful sleep. It is quiet and close to the beach and shopping, retaurants. Its a great place to stay!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Very clean, modern and spacious with a kitchen.  Stayed two nights, only problem is that the beds are way too plush so I couldn't sleep and my father slept on the floor.  Kitchen doesn't have enough spoons so we took turns eating cereal.  Quality is very nice, particularly the tiled bathrooms.< /text>

<Review>The hotel staff were friendly and helped me quickly check in when I arrived late. The room was adequate and clean, but could definitely use some updates. There was no hair dryer, I had added a request for one in my online reservation (their hotels.com details stated one could be available upon request), but by the time I noticed there wasnt a hair dryer, the front desk was closed; just a minor inconvenience. The area isnt glamorous, but it was convenient for my business travel, and is actually close to a few tasty restaurants (Cafe Nuveau and Gotetsu). With a couple of pieces of new furniture and a new toilet seat, I would probably return here.< /Review>< Rating>

<review>Really nice place. I was happily surprised. I ended up staying at the Viking because all the bigger hotels were booked or the prices had gone up over $250 a night (which I didn't want to pay). The Viking was a great place for the price and I will probably choose to stay here again when staying in Ventura regardless of the availability or prices of other locations. (And I felt safe).<//review>< Time>

Very interesting mote. A little run down on the outside, but the rooms were great. You get a lot of space for the price, including a full kitchen and a large spa bath. Decors a little odd but acceptable for the accommodations.< /text>

When my 15 year old son and I pulled into the parking lot he said Mom this is ghetto.  Please tell me we wont stay here  He didnt feel safe and neither did I .  I wish I had known its not a good neighborhood.  There were guests (sketchy looking people) hanging out in the parking lot outside their room.  We didnt even get out of the car.  We left, knowing the $85 room charge was non-refundable.  It wasnt worth it.  Take note that we did not get out of the car, but Orbitz requires answers for hotel staff, room cleanliness and room comfort.  We did not see this so I cant really rate it.</review>

Great room for the money. The outside has a similar look to some of the rundown motels in the Ventura area but the insides are newly remodeled and nice.< /text>

I arrived for check-in and they said that their website had cancelled my reservation even though I had the printout of my approved reservation. They sold me their 'last room' for an extra $40- I was stuck. The room was great with a nice shower, kitchen and comfortable bed. My tv remote had no batteries so I asked for some. They couldn't find any. I was going out anyway so asked that they put the remote back in the room once they found the batteries. Several hours later there was still no remote. I finally rang their bell at 8am the next day and asked for the remote back so that I could just go buy some batteries myself. They found the batteries. The couple was very nice and the room was nice, but my situation was certainly not handled properly.< /review>

Room was beautiful, but i specifically asked for the room with a Jacuzzi, I paid extra for it, even though it had 3 beds, and i really only needed 1, was told to come back in a couple hours, when I came back they gave me a beautiful room, with a kitchen and beautiful everything, except no jacuzzi...when i asked they said that one was taken, and said I could come back the next day, but i really just want my money back, we'll see what happens I guess...</review>

Great prices, I got the room with the hot tub and the location is great you can ride your bike to the beach and downtown from here.   Nice TV's in every  room, they are constantly cleaning and you can't go wrong with the price. Will recommend.< /Review>

Pretty nice and clean, a little out dated and in need of some general maintenance, but over all a fine experience indeed. Front desk people were friendly and helpful. Only minor complaint is we could hear the people above us walking around due to thin, squeaky floors.<//review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>First of all: When they say it's a "full kitchen" they don't mean there's enough to actually cook something. We had to ask for pots and pans, and the staff really put an effort in making it seem like an effort for them to provide us with what we in the end thought was "a kitchen with stuff so you can boil pasta". I did find trash on the floor from previous guests (or maybe the staff had been drinking beer in our room before our arrival?). Some of the light bulbs in the ceiling were out and there was *a hole in the wall*, like if someone had hit it in pure frustration over what they had paid for this place. However, it was cheap (but not _that_ cheap), so we didn't have high hopes. Even though, the hole in the wall did make it feel really cheap.< /review>< Pics>

My favorite place to stay in Ventura! the rooms are great, actually more like a studio. My bed was amazing! The staff is very helpful and friendly..Very convenient to the beach, and downtown ventura. Only reason i dont give 5 stars is because the prices are a little high.</text>

< Review>
So, on a normal day, I cant say I would recommend this motel over other hotels. Here are the pros: clean, lots of space, kitchen area with full fridge, nice TV, there is a woman at the front office who is very friendly, it is super close to the CLIF Bar Mountains to Beach race location. Here are the cons: very outdated, room smelled like smoke when not aired, there is a man at the front office who is not the most friendly, motel is not really in a great location if you dont have a car. When I say outdated, I mean, it definitely needs an overhaul. I pulled back the comforter on the bed and immediately saw two holes from cigarette burns on the underside of the comforter, but they obviously just used it anyway. Its a fine place for necessity but I wouldnt choose it over a nicer hotel for the price of one was coming for a longer vacation.</Review>

<text>Trip started out disappointing when we realized it was not in the heart of downtown, in fact we had to take a taxi since it wasnt even walking distance. Brisk walk to the beach? Not even and if you were to walk it would 1st be through a shady are where it didnt even seem safe for 2 woman. 2nd the hotel double charged us and it took almost 2 hours on the phone with [...] for the hotel to figure out they were wrong, now we have to wait at least 5 days for a credit but have 2 posted charges, not good when you live paycheck to paycheck. 3rd I was nearly attacked by a dog of one of the hotels residents in the parking lot. So all in all it was a terrible trip and we will never go back to this yucky and unprofessional facility. [...]<//text>< pictures>

im new to the ventura area, and had been staying at one of the nearby motels, i got this one for one night, and its absolutely gorgeous! the rooms are very clean, the staff is super friendly and courteous. I wish the weekly rates werent out of my range, i would definitely stay longer, the rooms are very large, my room is more like a stuido with a full kitchen included. Excellent place to stay<//Text>

<text>I hated this place. once i got inside u arent welcomed or asked for help i had to tap someone on the shoulder that was already cutting someone’s hair and ask for a haircut they just said “ list your name “ showing me a notebook they had so i did. i waited for 25minutes and someone finished cutting someone’s hair and they just looked at the list and sat down and i asked if they saw my name and if they could give me a haircut and they just said no. Very rude wouldn’t ever go back</text><Resp>None<//Resp><Name>emily lizabeth<//Name><Gmap_id>0x80857803a0ba37f7:0x1365c2ddf066130<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

My hair is long,2b curly, regular density but I dont have that much hair. So I went here trying to get a cheap hair cut and boy was that what I got. The young woman is the one that cut my hair. I asked for long layers but not too many because I don't have that much hair but she had some weird technique that I hadn't seen before and she thinned my hair with her dull scissors and made my hair look thinner. I waited as long as I could then went to another place to get layers cut off it was a bit short for   me but I just had to(p.s. love my new haircut  got a blunt straight across cut)< /Text>

<Text>This place has only on person that's efficient. Hi goes by the name Johnny. The rest are just the slowest lazy people you can ever imagine. You will think that they are running a business and not a social club. Este lugar no es recomendado si quieres un corte rapido. La duena no tiene interes en tu tiempo.

(Translated by Google) Good work and everything. But they talk a lot to each other. I went a few months ago and told them to take a little off me. And then at the end of so much they will take away almost everything. They are very distracted..😊🤷‍♂️

Esta barbería es una de las más solicitadas por los hombres más modernos podríamos decir y las mamás tan bien traen a sus hijos,tiene aproximadamente a cuatro barberos y un estilista,debo decir que los barberos son muy buenos en lo que hacen pues tienen una clientela bastante grande, y si vas a este lugar debes hacer cita o llevar mucha paciencia pues ellos toman muy en serio su trabajo y además sus precios son un poco más altos en comparación con los demás zona,pero vale cada centavo,yo he visitado este lugar un par de ocasiones y las dos veces salí muy contento con el servicio,solo un poco cansado por la espera,pero el servicio de corte y barba delinida fue una buena experiencia con el barbero Cristian de Honduras una excelente persona,no les doy mejor calificación por la demora tán enorme entre cortes,pero si lo recomiendo.< /Review><Rate>3< /Rate>< Name>

(Translated by Google) They are too slow, they talk a lot between them and they are very distracted ... they do a good job but, you spend up to 3 hours waiting for your turn because they are too slow, and they have no supervision.

Son demasiados lentos, hablan mucho entre ellos y son muy distraídos... hacen muy buen trabajo pero,  pasas hasta 3 horas esperando tu turno porque son demasiados lentos, y no tienen supervisión.<//Text>

This was an excellent car buying experience (which sounds even as weird to write as it probably is to read). Jhovan was fantastic and did everything he said he was going to do. He facilitated my purchase from out of state and was flexible in allowing me to pick the car up at my convenience (coming from the east coast). I will definitely work with him again in the future. Once again, I recommend this team to anyone looking to get a luxury automobile.</text>

Angel Moreno made our experience of buying our first Porsche a delight. He was super responsive and he kept us updated on all the process and next steps until he was able to deliver the car. The whole process was flawless and everyone involved were very professional, so I definitely recommend Porsche Ontario as your Porsche dealership!<//Text>

Gilbert assisted me with my purchase and stayed late without even any pressure to finish the deal so he could go home and even offered to help me set up my phone and go over some features.  I had made two trips to the dealership to test drive a Macan and he was very patient with zero pressure. Shelby was amazing in finance to deal with made me feel like part of the family. We drove about 4 and a half hours and it was worth the drive. Highly recommend them.< /text></record>

Patrick Posey was very helpful. I don’t like to go to any car dealerships when shopping for vehicles.
I always get anxiety when doing so.  Patrick greeted me with warm welcome the 1st time when I visited the dealership and had put me at much ease. His team is great. The financing manager Shelly is awesome. I would strongly recommend this dealership if you are looking for a Porsche. The excellent service elevates the experience when you are shopping for a higher ticket item.< /review>

The service was amazing! Sha was my sales rep and he made the purchase of my car seamless! He followed up with me during for 3 months as my lease for my BMW was coming due and when the car in the color and specs that I wanted came in, he didn’t forget about me and called me right away to have me come in.  Thank you sha for helping me purchase my first Porsche!< /Text>

Great dealership on the luxury vehicle. We had great shopping experience with one salesman Jhovan Coronado . He was very helpful for the first Porsche shopper as us. He was a honest salesman which could keep his words. Happy to make a deal with this place and if we need any extra Porsche in our garage, we will definitely come back to Jhovan with no doubt .</Text>

The facilities are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and professional. Patrick Posey was a super star. From my initial emails to the completion of my purchase, he was always responsive, helpful and knowledgeable. Shelly Fisher was also fantastic to work with with. They both made the entire experience a pleasure. I highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a Porsche.</Review>< Pictures>

Megan Breunig the sales associate I worked with was very knowledgeable, kind and caring and made my buying experience truly enjoyable. I highly recommend her. The dealership is clean and well organized. Shelly Fisher in financing was superb and thorough. Overall an A+ experience that I would recommend to anyone looking to buy a Porsche or any vehicle they sell</Text>

I have nothing but great things to say about my recent Taycan leasing experience with Sales Ambassador Gilbert Villagrana and Finance Ambassador Shelly Fisher III.  Both were ultra professional and helpful at every stage.  I emailed the dealership about a Taycan 4S that had just arrived, and heard back from Gilbert the same day, with a video of the car.  The next day we negotiated a very competitive lease price, and I put down a deposit to hold the car.  I then discovered I needed a bigger battery and asked Gilbert to find me a different 4S, in a hard-to-find color, with other desired options.  Diring the next two weeks he scoured all available and incoming inventory at dealerships throughout Ca and neighboring states, keeping me posted along the way.  Eventually Gilbert found just the right car coming into another dealership.

Even though Porsche Ontario needed to swap a car with a dealership hundreds of miles away to get me the one I wanted, they honored the original price we had negotiated for a car in their inventory.  The day after I signed the lease, Gilbert drove 6 hours to pick up my car at the other dealership, dropped his own car off, and then drove my car another 3 hours further to deliver it to my home.  I told him he didn't need to do that, but Gilbert wanted to configure the PCM and other systems, explain the car's features, and answer any questions I might have.  He then Ubered back to the other dealership to pick up his own car and return home.  All on a Friday!  During the next week Gilbert checked in regularly and helped answer my follow-up questions.  The Taycan is a complicated car and this proved very helpful.  How's that for going the extra mile?

Shelly was also great to deal with.  I've come to dread the usual finance department add-on pitches and hard sells.  That's not what I encountered with Shelly.  He explained the add-on packages that Porsche makes available, made straightforward recommendations about what he thought made sense for a lessee, and completely left it to me to decide with no pressure whatsoever.  Shelly also arranged for me to docu-sign all the papers and expedited completion of my lease.

I'm an attorney, I dislike surprises, and I know when someone is trying to game me. I encountered none of that.  On the contrary, I have never had a better car buying/leasing experience with any brand or dealership.   Not even close.   These gentlemen are the best, bar none.  I would do business again with either of them, and with the Porsche Ontario dealership, in a flash.

As for the Taycan 4S, it's a high spirited thing of beauty.  I  have never driven anything quite like this solid rocket. After blast off, you can just sit back and enjoy the sound system, which also delivers the best acoustic experience I've ever had.   Nice work Porsche.  Now I'm thinking 12k/year will not be enough.<//Text>

One of the my best car leasing experiences at this dealership. I got a best deal on this newly released Porsche Taycan. No game, great prices was offered at first round 😊Patrick my sales person is very very good, sales manager Pouya is the best. Finance manager Shelly was so patient explaining all the options for me. Just simply best pricing, best services , and fast process. Love it. I will really like to recommend this Ontario Porsche dealership 👍< /Text>

<review>We had a wonderful experience with Porsche Ontario sales. From initial contact with the dealership to driving away in our new Porsche, the entire team was responsive, thorough, friendly, courteous, and exceptional to work with. Primo Garcia was fantastic. We connected early on about a Porsche that we unfortunately couldn't come to final terms on. However, once a couple of other options became available, Primo and his colleague Patrick Posey provided us prompt and complete information. Never did we feel pressured to make a quick, uninformed decision. It was a thorough process and we felt very good about our final decision. Even when we took our time, they still never made us feel like we were monopolizing their time. At the end, we know we made the right decision for us. And when we decided to sell our other Porsche, Pouya made us a great offer that made it very easy to sell it to them. And the great experience extends to the finance department, where Shelly made the process easy and complete. In the future, will definitely reach back out when another Porsche is in our sights.< /review>< Pictures>

<Date>1621521410995<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><text>My wife and I just purchased a Porsche Taycan from Porsche Ontario in California. We had visited several dealerships prior to choosing this place. On our first visit we were extremely impressed with the knowledge and demeanor of our salesperson, Christian Agraso. He answered our questions and went a lot further in describing his personal feelings regarding the car as well as this new Porsche dealership. After we chose to purchase there, Christian helped us build the car with all the options we desired. He didn’t hesitate to let us know which options we wouldn’t need and only recommended those extras that would enhance the vehicle’s performance and cosmetic appearance. His honesty was very obvious to my wife and me. From the time we confirmed our order for the exact car we desired, Christian continued to be accessible 24-7 to answer our questions. Finally upon picking up the vehicle yesterday, he spent many hours orientating us to the many aspects of this new beautiful vehicle. We were also impressed with the Finance Manager, Michael Cordona who was also very knowledgeable and honest in helping us decide on some insurance options for maintenance and wear and tear.
IN SUMMARY, ONTARIO PORSCHE reminds me of the old Avis Commercial which stated, “WE TRY HARDER”</text>< Pictures>

Absolutely loved my experience here!! I look young and when i went to other Dealerships nobody even gave me the time of day to go over the numbers of the vehicles i came for. Megan was my salesperson and she approached me right away. She was very friendly and  went over all my wants and needs. She went over all my questions and was straight-forward with all the numbers. The estimate she gave me was the same from start to finish. Would 100% recommend her to anyone looking to purchase here. Thanks for helping me find the perfect GT4 for me megan! Also a thank you to the manager Mark and the credit specialist Shelly!< /text>

<text>I purchased a used Tesla Model S from Ontario Porsche and I can honestly say that it was the best car buying experience of my life….mainly due to the salesperson I worked with, Primo Garcia.  Primo is super diligent, honest, and sincere.  He blasted through the paperwork and hooked me up with coffee, snacks, and nice conversation.  He also had the vehicle I brought to the dealership washed and drove it back to my house (40 minutes away) so that I could take my new car home!!!:-). If you want a first class experience all the way around, work with Primo Garcia at Porsche Ontario…you will not be disappointed!!!<//text>< Pictures>

I felt very comfortable to schedule an appointment as my requested. After finishing chatting, I got a text message with confirming my appointment and advising the address as well which is very helpful to me.  Their location is very easy to find. Once walking into the building, I got very warm welcome and had been taken care of right away. I mentioned I was interested in that 2020 new Macan special offer. The sales person Patrick went to drive that car to the front and instructed me for a test drive. I like the car very much. Then Patrick worked on my lease of that car very professionally. I felt I made a super right decision to go to Porsche Ontario. It's a very happy experience to me. I am sure I will recommend this dealer to my friends.<//Text></record>

<text>The most satisfiying experience than any other dealer in the area. Number one reason is pricing - nowhere in town could beat what they offered.  Excellent customer care, prompt response and top-notch service.  Highly recommended if you are shopping for a car.  Be sure to ask for Mark,  Megan, and Dan!<//text></record>

David is an awesome advisor. Very communicative from the start to the finish. You don’t have to guess what’s going with your vehicle. He’s on top of it. Francis, technician, very personable and willing to explain the vehicle. Both were a pleasure to work with. I’ll definitely be back.< /Text>

Exceptional staff in a beautiful facility.   Primo Garcia provided first class customer service on a recent visit to check out a pre owned car.  People are friendly and the dealership is pristine and very well managed.   I was genuinely impressed and enjoyed my experience at this dealership, plus they have plenty of eye candy for the auto enthusiast.   If I lived close, I would visit just for fun.  Thank you, Primo.<//Text>

I searched nearly 6 months for the right car and narrowed my choices down to two automobiles, the Land Rover or the Cayenne.  When I arrived to the lot Megan greeted me and was extremely helpful without being pushy during my visit to Porsche Ontario.  She was knowledgeable and spoke first hand about her own Porsche ownership this made me even more comfortable with my car buying experience.  Although I paid cash for my Cayenne,  the gentleman in finance was extremely nice and helpful as well.  Great experience!!!<//review>

I didn’t call for an appointment I just drove in because my check engine light was on. Kevin Hayes was the one who helped me. Very professional and thorough.

I recently Purchased a new Panamera 4 for my wife. We traded in her Mercedes Benz. My experience was actually very good. We arrived at the dealer and was greeted by Megan Breunig. A very nice young lady who took us on the test drive. She was very knowledgeable about the vehicle, and very personable. I fully expected her to pass us off to another Sales person or Manager after the test drive, but it never happened. Nice thing about the dealership was I dealt with Megan start to finish. It was nice to deal with one person start to finish, that usually never happens. We worked on the numbers of the new car which was fairly straight forward, as the dealership had the vehicle I was interested in priced very fair to begin with. Where I usually have the issue is with the trade in. That is when things generally go south. They offered me from the beginning, what I felt was a very fair price for my trade in. I had already done my research so I knew what a fair offer was, and what I would accept. We made some minor adjustments on the numbers came to an agreement and my wife drove home the car of her dreams. It was really just that simple! The entire staff was awesome but Megan went the extra mile and never once pressured me. She listened to my concerns, work for me to make sure I was happy with my purchase and that I was completely satisfied. After the paperwork was complete it was time to take delivery.  Megan made sure my wife knew everything about her new car. She took her time explaining everything, how it works, set up her phone, and I could not have been  more pleased. Usually there is a quick once over and they send you on your way. Then its up to me to figure out the car and explain it all to my wife. It was by all accounts, a very good experience start to finish. Cannot say enough about Megan and the staff at Porsche Ontario. Our sincere thanks!

I’m very happy with my experience at Porsche Ontario. Not only did they have the exact vehicle I’d been searching for in stock, but Patrick Posey on the sales team was able to explain all the tech details of the E Hybrid in a way that was easily understood and didn’t make me feel overwhelmed. He was very patient and seemed happy to answer my many questions. I hadn’t planned on buying that day, but I drove away in a new car and I feel great about the purchase.</Review>

My first service visit after purchasing my Porsche Cayenne (Pre-owned Certified) exceeded my expectations! My tech, Kevin Hayes, was great—very knowledgeable, professional, and, most of all, super courteous. He treated me as a valued customer even though it was my first time at Ontario Porsche.
All of the service was explained and my questions answered. He even took the time to show me how to program my garage opener to the car 😀 after I had been trying and failing for the 4 months I’ve had my beautiful Cayenne! The facility is easy to find and definitely exemplifies Porsche high quality.</Text>

Everything was done as professionally and prompt!  I can't wait to go back there to purchase a another one again in the future.  +AAAAAAAAAA Porsche dealer for sure!</Review>

I found my Porsche Macan on line, called the dealership in Ontario and talked with JB. I made an appointment to test drive the car. I met with him on the lot he gave me some necessary information to test drive the car. He sat in the back with his mask on and answered any question I had for him. He was very professional, and very courteous. I could not go back to buy the car right away so asked him if he would hold the car for me until the next day he said he would keep it in the back. When my husband & I met with him to purchase the car he was honest and open, I did feel that he was helping me to get the best deal. After all the paperwork were done he sat on the passenger side and explained every single button that I needed to know on the car. He was a gentleman he gave me his number and told me to call him anytime with any question. Overall I gave my experience with him & the dealership ten out of ten!< /text>

{'time': 1614368704273, 'text': 'Mr. Sing,\nI have to be honest here and say I’m really dumbfounded that you would make these accusations since they are so far from the truth it’s laughable. You wanted to buy a Panamera from us in California and ship it to your home in Texas, no problem, we do 10-15 deals like this a month. Now we need some sort of commitment from you that you are really buying this car so we don’t sell it to someone else while the paperwork is finished, so we ask for a CC deposit which we do not even run. Then we need to get proof of your income to get you financed; you provided a document that was not accepted by the bank. We then asked you for the documents the banks asked for and you did not send them and therefore we cannot get you financed. That’s when you began calling with profanity laced verbal assaults on our team members. Now, you feel that it’s ok to write these libelous reviews as further retribution because you didn’t get financed. Mr. Sing, we sell lots of cars all over the country and have very little issue doing it; the reason you don’t have the car is that you cannot prove your income in a manner that is acceptable to the bank. Furthermore, we do not want to do business with you. Your behavior and abuse is something we will not subject our team to any longer. We encourage you to please take your business elsewhere.\n\nMark Marchant\nGeneral Manager\nPorsche Ontario\n(909) 292-1939'}<//Response>

<text>This is a new dealership of Porsche in Ontario. I was really surprise that they open one so I decided to give a try. The dealership is huge and clean and has so many inventories of car. First time here and I met Megan Breunig. She Is amazing! She is really friendly And professional. She is really patient and not waste my time at all! I was in a hurry and She really tried her best and took care of my old car and helped me get a brand new Macan at a really good deal! She went beyond and forward to help me work on deals. She is really the best 𝐀uto sales I have ever met! I will definitely go back to her and bring more friends to her if anyone need a Porsche!</text></record>

Awesome car buying experience at Porsche Ontario, especially my sales advisor, JB Beitz.  He handled the complicated out of state purchase like a veteran.  He has been selling cars for many years, and knows all the minute details that are required to get the job done.  Two huge thumbs up to JB and Porsche Ontario.</review>

< Review>
My boyfriend and I went to five different car dealerships and made Porsche Ontario our last stop. I had the Macan in the back of my mind when we walked in and we were greeted by Jonathan. We walked around discussing a few options and ended up picking out one of the smaller suv's we liked. My boyfriend and I were debating back and forth and we had no pressure whatsoever from Jonathan who was very professional and knowledgeable. He helped us make a decision, which was a pretty big decision for me choosing a luxury suv like this. We are very happy to have purchased from Porsche Ontario, everyone was super nice and friendly, great experience! Shelley in finance was also great helping us with all the paperwork. Last but least, absolutely love driving the Macan!< /Review>

I immediately stopped at Porsche Ontario and before I was even out of the car, David Barron was at the car diagnosing the problem. Within 20 minutes I was checked in, car was taken into the service bay and I was driving home in a beautiful Macan S as a loaner. David kept me updated via text throughout the service. Porsche Ontario and more specifically David Barron made the experience 5 stars. Also, this is my second Porsche and highly recommend asking for Bob Macdonald when it comes time to buy one. He lives and breathes Porsche! Thanks David, Bob and Ontario Porsche.</review>< Pics>

<review>Initially, I was looking to purchase a low mileage,  certified preowned car from a local Porsche dealership in the San Diego area, and after much online searching, I was surprised to find that the exact car I was looking for was at Porsche Ontario.  I contacted the dealership through their online chat and was immediately helped out by Christian Agraso ( Porsche brand ambassador), who confirmed that they had the vehicle on the lot and sent me pics and a short video of the car.  Within 10-15 minutes, (and I really mean 10-15 minutes!) Christian and I were able to come to a price point I was comfortable with and filled out some of the paperwork online.  I set up a time to pick up the car that same day and drove to the dealership (very nice, modern and new Porsche dealership!).  Christian Agraso met me almost immediately and took me to the car to test drive and go over the car details, (the car was also immaculately detailed inside and out!) I signed the remaining paperwork with Shelly (finance manager who was also friendly and professional!).  Within 20 minutes I was ready to roll!  I have purchased vehicles online and over the phone before, but this by far, was the easiest, smoothest and best car purchase I have ever had!  If you ever need to pirchase a Porsche, I would highly recommend Porsche Ontario and Christian Agraso! They also have several electric charging stations on site and was able to charge my electric vehicle!  Thanks Christian and Porsche Ontario!<//review>< gmap_id>

{'time': 1614368614787, 'text': 'Mr. Sing,\nI have to be honest here and say I’m really dumbfounded that you would make these accusations since they are so far from the truth it’s laughable.  You wanted to buy a Panamera from us in California and ship it to your home in Texas, no problem, we do 10-15 deals like this a month. Now we need some sort of commitment from you that you are really buying this car so we don’t sell it to someone else while the paperwork is finished, so we ask for a CC deposit which we do not even run.  Then we need to get proof of your income to get you financed; you provided a document that was not accepted by the bank.  We then asked you for the documents the banks asked for and you did not send them and therefore we cannot get you financed.  That’s when you began calling with profanity laced verbal assaults on our team members. Now,  you feel that it’s ok to write these libelous reviews as further retribution because you didn’t get financed. Mr. Sing, we sell lots of cars all over the country and have very little issue doing it; the reason you don’t have the car is that you cannot prove your income in a manner that is acceptable to the bank.  Furthermore, we do not want to do business with you. Your behavior and abuse is something we will not subject our team to any longer.  We encourage you to please take your business elsewhere.\n\nMark Marchant\nGeneral Manager\nPorsche Ontario\n(909) 292-1939'}</response>

<Review>Porsche Ontario saves the day. My car broke down as we were driving to a weekend get away on a Friday afternoon. The service manager Manni was so helpful and considerate. Manni went out of his way to run a diagnostic on the car, thankfully the issue was not severe. The dealership had the needed part in stock and repaired the car that same Friday afternoon. The service shop is large and also impeccable. Besides the service area, the showroom is beautiful, spacious and modern, representative of the Porsche’s on display. Truly beautiful performance vehicles. Everyone we encountered was helpful and accommodating ( putting  a kids channel on the tv for my child) . I highly recommend Porsche Ontario for all Porsche needs. Thank you!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

I just purchased a 2020 911 Carrera Cabriolet from the dealership through Alex Montiel as salesman. Both Alex and everyone else at the dealership was helpful and respectful. I would highly recommend Alex so ask for him by name. He is professional and always willing to help

UPDATE:

As of today my new vehicle has been in the Ontario service department for over a week after I drove it home and one other time and sadly the Porsche Connect hasn’t worked correctly from the evening I bought the car. After some research, I’ve discovered that the PCM not working on many Porsche cars is a known problem dating back at least to 2015 from what I can find. To me that means all Porsche dealers know about this issue and are still selling these cars and allowing customers to drive them off their lot saying things like- “it will connect once you get out into the open Air and the signal comes through!”  That’s what I was told and it was a lie, plain and simple. If you decide to buy a Porsche with a PCM, DO NOT DRIVE OFF THE LOT, unless you know the PCM is fully functioning or you’ll be in the same position I’m in now. You’ve been fore warned.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Pure Taiwanese cuisine, praise, good greetings, and occasionally guests have to wait a little longer, but it is worth it, it feels much better than Xianyuxian.

純正台灣菜，讚，招呼好，偶爾客人多就要等一等了，但是值得，比鮮芋仙感覺好多了。< /review>

(Translated by Google) Love to come to eat here, it is our pocket list. The service is cordial and the taste is very authentic. Braised pork rice, salmon fried rice and shrimp fried noodles are all our favorites. They are delicious!

<Text>I was pleasantly surprised with this pizza. I just got a cheese, but the taste was very good. The crust, cheese, and sauce were all very good. They had outdoor seating, just watch out for squirrels trying to steal some dinner!<//Text>< pictures>

Was here on a Thursday to get some pizza almost 2 hrs before closing time. Waited am hour for pizza to arrive but it was due to huge orders before us. Pizza tasted good but I've had better. El capitain was probably the best on the menu to me. Given how there is little choice for outdoor dining in the area it's good.</review>

Pretty friendly peeps, but unfortunately they made errors in my order and the people in front and behind us.  The food was decent and the wait very long after ordering. I'm unsure why they close so early with 600 tents nearby....be nice (and prob very busy) if they stayed open til peeps came off the trail.  I honestly didn't give them a second chance this trip...perhaps another try next visit.  Chicken fritter sandwich was on very large ciabotta and pretty tastey.</Text>

What's not to love about Yosemite...  If you are visiting and enjoy pizza, this pizza is good and the setting is spectacular.  Price is reasonable and makes it a favorite stop for my family when we visit the park.  The attached photo is from another spot in the valley.</Text>

If you go in here, there are two options for you specialty pizza and build your own. Well, I'm a small eater, so I chose build your own and picked small size. Small size came with 4 slices which was more than enough to fill my portion and then some. It was really delicious and what was even better was that the dining room was very spacy and cozy. They had some christmas decorations and lighting was just bright enough for good moody brightness.</text>

Nice stop when biking around in the valley, and surprisingly good pizza considering the touristy spot. Had to wait a bit for the pizza but turned out it was worth it. Also, being able to buy some good beer from the next door bar was a huge plus!<//Text>

<review>They were overwhelmed with orders when we were there and actually paused the line for 15 minutes to catch up. It took another 45 mins after ordering but it was well worth the wait. The flavors were amazing. Crust was perfect. Would gladly wait an hour again to enjoy another pizza.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Conveniently located pizza place. For me the crust was a little too close to the consistency of cardboard but the toppings, sauce, and cheese were good. They had salad also so the wife could eat something that wouldn't kill her gluten and dairy allergy. Overall I thought it was a little pricey but it is a long way from the nearest town so you have to take that into consideration.< /Review>

Great pizza. As long as you aren't there during the busy hours (~5pm-8pm) in the summer it's quick. Prices are higher than a city but reasonable for a national park.<//review>

<review>Much has changed in the valley since I first visited decades ago, but one thing remains the same...Pizza Patio is still cranking out excellent pizza. Yes, there is often a long line, but it's worth the wait. The seating area has expanded over the years, so finding a shady table is no problem. Of course, you can take your food inside as well if you need to escape the weather.< /review>< pictures>

This is definitely the best food in Curry village. Pizzas would hold up to most pizza joints outside of the valley as well. The only downside is that the lines are often extremely long.<//text>

<text>Limited varieties of pizza are available here and they are good. Veg pizza had lot of veg toppings. Pizza comes in small, medium and large size. Large pizza is sufficient for 3-4 adults. Since this is the only pizza place, it's bit crowded and takes some time to get the pizza after ordering. Outdoor seatings only.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8096f239a8b036cf:0x1c30485f071498f3</gmapID></record>

<Review>This was our treat after hiking Vernal Falls with no snacks. We devoured the pizza. Loved watching the fat squirrel. But the image of him/her will be a permanent reminder to stay away from carbs. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂< /Review>< user_name>

Lines were long and pizza was pretty good. But, you're in the middle of one of the most picturesque places on earth, so it hard to beat that.<//review>

I was very pleasantly surprised at the size of the pizza and the quality was pretty good. The buffalo chicken pizza had a good amount of meat on it and the dough was thick and cooked through. Only knock is that it was a bit pricey but what do you expect for a park restaurant.</text>

<Text>Probably the best place for vegetarians in Yosemite. Breakfast & brunch are worth the price. Pizza, served for lunch and dinner is bit over priced, but tastes good. Customizable too. Best place to sit and watch your favorite sports team play.< /Text>< response>

One of better locations inside Yosemite park to get a very good pizza. It is bit expensive but compared to other food options available, this is priceless. They also offer salads and soups. Wish they were open throughout the winter times.<//Review>

Would also recommend their fried chicken. Didn't get to try the main dining hall inside as the kitchen was closed.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Order went fine, BUT...
Pizza took an hour to be prepared, with no explanation. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's overpriced ($20 a medium pizza, enough for 2 people), because they're the only one opened a little late so they'll always sell...
And it was tasteless, overly greasy (where was the chicken btw?)... Definitely not going back.<//Text>

The price is outrageous, the food is horrible, and above all, the staff is extremely incompetent rude and impatient. The pizza they served me has pitifully little topping despite I ordered three "extra" topping. And the worst part is that it is literally RAW in the middle. I went back and showed them and at first they just won't even admit it's raw. I mean, I know what raw flour tastes like. I showed the pizza to a few people waiting in the line, and they all said it's raw. That is when they finally agreed to reheat it. So they stuck it in the oven and just walked away for like two minutes, and then they returned the pizza with everything super burnt, all the topping is burnt pitch black. So I pointed out that it is now overcooked and burnt, and the staff shrugged to me and with a provocative tone he said, "Oh yeah? Now it's overcooked huh?" Honestly I am pretty sure this guy did it on purpose just to get back to me because I made him look bad in front of the customers. This is about a year ago, but this experience is so bad that I still remember it clear as day.<//text>< username>

We wanted a quick bite so we went for pizza. It took almost 45 mins for pizza to arrive and it was almost cold. Taste was also not that good. The price for the pizza might be reasonable for the tourist place but still high for the sub par pizza.</text>

< review>
This place is a minor part of the myth and legend of rock climbing in the valley so I hate to leave it a negative review but it is bad. There was an extremely long wait to order and to get food, the breadsticks were burned, the pizza was no better than frozen, and the employees clearly didn't care at all with one working while the other two watched or fooled around with the kitchen gear and food. There was garbage on all the tables and on the ground with no one cleaning it up. The raccoons can be entertaining or annoying depending on whether or not they stay under your table or climb onto it. This restaurant is a great example of what happens when there is no competition.</review>

(Translated by Google) This pizza is really delicious, all made to order! You can buy them with good flavors, or you can combine the ingredients of your choice into a customized flavored pizza. A medium-size pizza is about US$20, and the serving size is probably enough for 2~3 people to share it together.

這家的pizza真的很好吃，都是現點現做！可以買他們搭配好的口味，也可以自選配料組合成客製化口味的pizza，一個medium size的pizza約美金$20左右，份量大概夠2~3人一起分食。</Text>

Great place to take your cat to get shaved. My cat has very dense fur and usually during the summer i shave him down and let his fur grow back for the winter. The price is great for getting your cat groomed on a budget. They also take walk ins so no appointment needed! But you can still make appointments if choose to do so.<//Text>

Good prices and they are fast. If you are unsatisfied with anything just let them know and they'll fix it if they can.</Text>

<Review>Love this place! They take last minute appointments and their service is consistent.

Drop off, walk-ins welcome, decent grooming for dogs, and can't beat the steady price.< /Review>

I took our hospital dog baby girl for her 1st hair cut and bath away from us. The gentlemen who does the grooming is very nice and he did a great job. He said she was very good with him. I asked for a neat trim on her and looked so cute and knew she was feeling pretty.<//text>

It's no biggie but if ur picky....I'd go to covys on meekland oh and this lady almost gave me the wrong dog, and two different leashes before randomly selecting my pet and her leash. And they didn't do anything to verify that my dog was really mine. They should have something to make me feel like they aren't going to give my dog away by "accident"< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

She is super flexible whether we call in or walk in. Reasonable prices. It's super hard to cut one of my puppy's nails at home and they grow SUPER fast as he is the lazier out of the two and is super sensitive. She has always been gentle and sensitive to each of their personalities. LOVE this place!<//review>< Resp>

Good prices. They usually can squeeze my small dog in. Sometimes the cut is a bit uneven but I have experienced similar quality issues at places that charge nearly double.< /review>

The lady their is so unprofessional she doesn’t know how to do her work today I came in when I was trying to explain to her how I wanted her to do it she was on the phone ( not with a client ) and I showed her a picture of how I wanted it and she first said she couldn’t do it because it was  a different race but I clarified that it was not a different race because they are both shih tzu and after I said that she said that was a model and she couldn’t do which for me is very unprofessional because she’s a “groomer “ she’s supposed to know how then she said  she couldn’t and I said it was fine but the only thing I asked for was to leave the top of her head long so I could do a little bow  plus the regular trimming and then when we went to pick her up she had cutted all her hair and didn’t cut her nails or trimmed her paws or her privates  after that I told her that I had told her earlier to not cut that part of her hair cause then I wouldn’t be able to make a bow  but she insisted  that you could do it so she tried to grab her and my poor baby screamed I don’t Know what she did to her but  she was super scared of her.

PlEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG THEIR SHE IS THE WORST “GROOMER “</text>

Very good haircut. Loved it. My dog looked so happy after. I took him to get a hair cut somewhere else and he came out completely traumatized. This places Is amazing and cheap. The staff was friendly. They did an amazing job and I would recommend them to someone else for sure.< /text>

At Tender Loving Care she got just that TLC and there was no problem.  She came out looking fluffy and clean.  I am very impressed, satisfied.  The  groomer was very good with her and my dog responded to the attention by being reasonably easy to handle.</text>< pics>

Our dog Bear Claw was fully groomed for the 1st time  on 5/15/16. She is a short haired overweight chihuahua mix. My husband went to pick her up early and she was giving the groomer trouble during shaving. But they got it done and she looks great! Glad I came across their add in the Castro Valley Forum. Prices are reasonable too.< /text>

<review>We called to make an appointment and showed up a few minutes early to talk with the groomer. This was the first time my mother and I were taking our puppy to get groomed. When we arrived my mother asked to see the bathing area. This is something all pet owners should be able to see in order to be assured we are taking our pets to an adequate groomer. We could only see the front area of the small store and it looked dirty. The groomer was very rude and defensive when my mom asked to see the bathing area he said "I don't get why you need to see it" "why do you need to see it". This was very uncomfortable and not very welcoming. His defensiveness was quite suspicious it makes no sense to not allow us to view the area that our dog was being bathed in. He made no effort to reassure us he only repeatedly asked us why we would want to see it. He also made no effort to keep us as customers. After being asked the same question over and over again ("why do you want to see it") we decided to leave. He was against the idea of us viewing his grooming area his body language was uneasy and his attitude and tone was just RUDE. Do not see this groomer if you want to garuntee a healthy grooming. There must have been something to hide. If not he did a poor job of explaining himself and making us feel comfortable of leaving our puppy with him.< /review>< user_name>

Wow! I took my dog here and couldn't believe the service I got. I was skeptical at first because there were no reviews for this place, but I'm glad I went in. The lady was extremely nice and caring!

Make sure that you call first for an appointment!

And make sure you go to the door on the left!< /text>

There were absolutely no complaints on the food as it was DELICIOUS... My only complaint was that there is only one key that opens both the women and the men's bathroom!! After waiting for about ten minutes walked into a filthy bathroom with one stall overflowing with #2...

< Review>
This may not be a negative for some of you, but the food has a very commercialized taste.  It tastes like a chain, not like a mom and pop place.  If you are looking for a mom and pop char broiled burger taste, this is probably not it.

These taste more like in and out burgers.</Review>

Will never go back. My burger meat was not done. I spent $50 for meals and it all went to waste. The meat was very pink in which i did not ask for pink meat. My children got sick as well as I. We saw the meat being pink and not done how i requested. Some people can eat pink meat. Well my family and myself can not. I will never go back.</Text>

Tom's Jr. was great! They did not disappoint! I always get a pastrami combo! It's tasty until the last bite. I add their fresh, crisp chili peppers for a little kick, but they are certainly not necessary to enjoy the pastrami! I got a steak sandwich (meat only), too. They serve a nice - sized rib eye steak, so tender that you don't need a knife.  I will say that back in the day, their pastrami sandwiches were so big you'd have enough left over for a lunch or meal the next day! That included the huge-sized fries. Today,  that's not the case because they keep their prices affordable, so, it's a win-win for everybody! For me, I choose quality over quantity - any day! I recommend this location as, well! It was very clean and modern! Many people were eating in and driving through! I look forward to my next visit!<//review>

I have been coming here pretty consistently for about a year and I've never had a bad experience. The food speaks for itself and the staff are amazing, never having attitudes & making sure your order is up to par.  The Place is always clean.  EBT food/cash accepted! Five stars all around.<//text>

Used to be a fairly satisfactory burgers and salads place for walking distance commuters,  but when one has a car, there are better, more enticing fast food places.  But, this location is lacking on 2 main FRONTS,  customer courtesy and food quality.  Ordered a chicken salad but it was rather a letuce and tomatoe salad, drive though lady almost forgot my ranch dressing (FIRST STRIKE) but luckily I did not press the  ccelerator and drove off from Drivethrough,  (STRIKE 2) upon request I Demanded  my dressing.  Dressing container was too small considering I had ordered a salad.  Requested an additional but  additional would cost an dditional price. (STRIKE 3)  MY IMPRESSION: lady  dispatching treats customers more as ghettoo recipients than customer .    Well anyways, I
parked to the curb  to eat my salad, turns out that dressing was deluted...why would I continue going  to Tom's Jr.  When we have Johnson Brother 's   BBQ a  block away, subway,  a quarter of a mile away or the Habit for a salad specialty On alondra and paramount Blvd.?  This Tom's  Jr. location was a disappointment.< /text>

<Text>The cashier tonight seemed to be really zoned out. No matter how many times we repeated our order she kept getting it wrong. Then she gave us the wrong change even though she had it sitting next to the register. Then she gave a loud burp and didn't say excuse me. I bought ranch dressing and it was watered down. This establishment is usually amazing, with great customer service and food but tonight was horrible. 01/25/2020</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Have tried a few things on their menu now and they are all pretty tasty. I have to say that my ultimate favorite thing from Tom's Jr is their Grilled Chicken Avocado sandwich. The drive-thru can sometimes take long but not a deal breaker since the food is good.<//review>

Food is pretty good. I admit that their kitchen practices make me uneasy though. No gloves and I see them wiping their hands on their cloths rather than practicing proper handwashing before cross contamination.... The area, well it's typical to have police circling the area. In all it's a good place for food, but I really feel the health department should pay them a suprise visit.< /review>

Great food and nice dining or breakfast experience!!!

The menu it's assertive and easy to read, the clerks greet you and help you to make your food selection.
The dining area it's really clean and it has big tables, the soda fountain has a good variety of drinks and they have refills.
You can find regular ketchup,spicy ketchup,  yellow peppers, salt and pepper and paper towels easily.
Great sense of security, since cops tend to have breakfast, lunch or dinner 24/7.<//review>

Really great burgers. Which is odd coming from a chain. It's a little bit more then the burger joint across the corner. But you can definately taste the difference. Staff if great also. Never ghetto. Lol. Never attitude. The family pack is great value! Really great joint.< /review>

Inspect your food before eating. I was served a pastrami on a bun that was filled with mold. Who doesn't see that the bread isn't good...Smh!<//review>

Honestly, the food was amazing and reasonably priced when it first opened up. Now, it's expensive garbage served by rude cashiers who fart and spray Febreeze right in front of you to cover it up. $9 for a burger, fries, and drink.< /Text>

The food is always good, it's a little pricey but not too much in a way. They just need to wash they hands often because people is watching then make they food, I would like to see them was they're hands.</review>
