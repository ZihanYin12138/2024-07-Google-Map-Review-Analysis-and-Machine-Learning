< Review>
Phones are horrible
They break down or have electrical problems. If you need help they don't know.what they r doing.  If you have one and it doesn't work you have to either buy a.new one or send it to corporate. U will be without a phone for 2 weeks if u send it in.

They only care about transferring you from another company. Once they have u as a customer they don't care about customer service at all.

DON'T go there unless u want problems or very poor customer service.</Review>

<review>I ordered a desk plant for my daughter's promotion at work.  I clicked on "allow designer to arrange".  I wanted something small and attractive that my daughter could keep on her desk. We live in IL and Plantation House Flowers sent me a picture of it before they delivered it.  It was gorgeous!  I could not have picked out a better design!  I loved it and so did my daughter!  I have bookmarked Plantation House Flowers to send my daughter all of her future flowers and gifts.  Thank you!!!</review>< response>

Stunning! Working with Jo was a pleasure and I am so impressed with the orchid arrangement that came today. The flowers are vibrant and full of life, and the vessel is exactly what I was hoping for to create a natural, minimalist aesthetic. We had some timing issues previously and Jo was so accommodating (and generous!) to make sure my needs were met.

I am happy to support family owned business in the area and Jo and her husband do fantastic work. I highly recommend Plantation House Flowers for any occasion!</review>

I received an amazing tiny desk succulent for my birthday - cutest thing I've ever seen - such an original. design.  I'm actually ordering one for a friend.  Jo's floral arrangements are also so beautiful.  Will definitely order from her next time I need to send flowers - so many amazing choices.  Very reasonable prices.  Excellent quality.  I also met Jo when she delivered my plant and she's just as lovely to meet and talk to as her plants and flowers.  Can't say enough good things about Jo and Plantation House.  One of LA's best.< /review>

<time>1610043953448</time><Review>I ordered the $85 designer's choice and while I was hesitant to do it I am beyond happy that I did. Here's why...

Jo, the owner/lead designer emailed me a series of questions to help her understand what I was looking for color / flower wise. We dove into those details but I also got to share a bit more about who I am, my personality, share some pix of where the arrangement would live in my house and just get to know Jo as she got to know me. We emailed twice and two days later the most stunning arrangement showed up! Jo took so much care, curated my arrangement especially for me, made sure that I was happy every step along the way.

While you may just wanna hit a button and buy flowers, that's all good but if you want something special made by someone who clearly is passionate about what she does and who she does it for, then pick the designer's choice and let Jo get to doing what she does best, her art with flowers!< /Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

<Review>This was a lovely experience from start to finish.  Jo was extremely responsive, even modified option on he website to meet our needs. I received text updates and photos throughout the process.  The arrangement itself was exquisite and worth every cent.  I will certainly us Plantation House Flowers fr my future floral needs and highly recommend them to anyone who wishes to have gorgeous flower arrangements specific to their needs.

LOVE Plantation House Flowers!! Jo is amazing -- she was so communicative and made a point to reach out and directly chat with me through some scheduling. She was able to accommodate and also sent a preview of the bouquet before it was *hand delivered* to my friend. Not to mention, the flowers were BEAUTIFUL! A+<//review>

<Time>1601912633773<//Time><review>Don't waste your time with the big flower companies!!! Work with Jo! By and large the best flower purchasing experience I've ever had. I was planning on going with 1800Flowers or similar, but decided to wait the extra couple days for something really special.  Jo worked with me all weekend to make sure the modest congratulations bouquet I wanted to send to my sister was just perfect. In the end, it was totally stunning, fully hand-made and well considered, and not at all as expensive as ordering from one of the major companies. My sister was thrilled and so was I!!! Will absolutely return to this flower shop and will be recommending to friends.</review>< username>

<Review>LOVED working with this small business. Great communication from start to finish; designs are gorgeous; flowers were sourced locally the morning-of delivery; they were able to swap out some of the greenery to ensure the arrangement would be safe for my friend's cats; they delivered to a hospital during this pandemic; AND--they send you a picture of the actual arrangement before delivery.

10/10, can't wait to work with them again.

Jo was an absolute pleasure to work with. She took ample time to listen to the intention for the flowers and what I wanted to include in the design. Her creation was stunning and exactly what I wanted. I will certainly be using her for ALL my local floral deliveries.< /review>

Gorgeous arrangement sent, thank you! There are many good flower shops but yours is outstanding! Your customer service is unheard of these days. Scott delivered the flowers on Friday but the person was not home. He went back on Sunday, his day off, to deliver them before my friend came home. If I could I would give you 10 STARS!!!!</Review>

words truly are not enough to describe ms. jo & her creations. she is truly an artist and i cannot recommend a better florist (and i've had many) in the Los Angeles area. she's extremely creative, responsive, & goes above and beyond with every single order. i'm proud to support her business during these times and bring so much joy to my household, my neighbors, and dear friends that i have in the LA area. i wish i could gift her services worldwide because her arrangements are truly that superb. thanks so much jo & i look forward to being your forever client as long as i'm in LA. xx< /Review>

Jo went above and beyond organizing a stunning bouquet for same day delivery. The arrangement brought the recipient to tears. She said she’d never received flowers so beautiful and ethereal. Can’t wait for the next occasion to surprise a friend or family member with flowers from Plantation House. 10/10 would recommend!< /review>

This was the most beautiful floral arrangement I have ever ordered! I only ordered a few days beforehand and they were still able to deliver on time. They emailed me a photo of the arrangement before it was delivered and also got a confirmation email when it was delivered. The recipient absolutely loved the flowers and even commented on how friendly the delivery person was. Would definitely recommend them!<//Text>

< Review>
I ordered a custom flower arrangement from Plantation House Flowers to be delivered to my godmother for Mother's Day, and they completely exceeded my expectations! I told Jo that we love peonies, and she sourced this GORGEOUS burgundy peony that I've never seen before. My godmother is obsessed with the flowers and love the cool vase that it came with.

Jo is not only extremely talented, but also friendly and professional. She sent me photos of the arrangement before delivering it to my godmother's house, and thanked me for supporting her new business. (They just opened in January.) Last but not least, her prices are very reasonable!

Plantation House Flowers is my new go-to florist in town!<//Review>

The flowers were absolutely stunning and the recipient was thrilled beyond belief. Jo was so helpful and communicative, even answering questions after-the-fact about the specific types of flowers and their qualities! Loved the bouquet and the florist--I've found my new go-to for LA flowers!<//Review>

< review>
I cannot say enough about the amazing service by owner Jo Halpert and the beautiful flower arrangement she made for my mother-in-law for Mother’s Day! I texted Jo in a panic on Friday morning before Mother’s Day because my husband & I spaced and we were not having luck finding a florist open near by her house in CA (we live in NM). I came across Jo’s website and on her webpage she had said to text her if you had questions or needed help for Mother’s Day. I saw she had no delivery dates open and took a chance & sent her a message. She told me she only had the Sunflower bouquet left flower wise and asked if that would work. I loved the idea as my mother-in-law is a ray of sunshine so it was fitting to me. Jo said she could have it delivered Saturday as my Mother-in-law lived not far from her shop. Jo stated she would add some other yellow flowers in too and send me a photo before it was delivered. I was expecting some pretty sunflower and was blown away by the absolutely beautiful arrangement Jo put together! To top it off, Jo’s husband & son (I believe that’s who it was, according to my mother-in-law) delivered the flowers and made sure she received them. My Mother-in-Law LOVES the arrangement!!! Thank you Jo for everything you did to make my Mother-in-Laws Mother’s Day that much better and thank you to your special delivery guys! I will order from no one other than you from now on!<//review>

<text>This place was the first step in my journey to a completely new life. I flew to this place from across the country and wanted to give recovery a shot in a new place. I went through a detox process that was much more comfortable than me trying to do it on my own. In fact, I was unable to detox on my own and had tried several times in the year leading up to my stay.  Upon arrival at the airport I was greeted by a gentleman who helped me with my bags and then drove me to the facility. I’m am so thankful that I chose this center. I am now 8 months clean and sober and I am very happy!</text>< Pictures>

Very welcoming staff and a very clean establishment. We sat at the patio and the atmosphere was refreshing and peaceful. They also had good tradicional music playing on LED TVs to complement the rest of the details. The chairs are very comfortable too. Now, about service...absolutely incredible! Why? Well, as a Retired Naval Officer, I have traveled the World and let me tell you that during my visit these guys were not lacking on attention to detail and good manners. The food was very well presented too; it was also fresh and at the right temperature. The flavor was as expected, very flavorful and balanced. Lastly, our drinks were kept full and refreshed with ice without even having to ask. Thank you! We will be back.< /Text>

Pretty good. The interior is very nice but is located between two strip clubs. Food was fresh but not a lot of flavor. They forgot my sauces so maybe that was the problem.</Text>

The food and atmosphere was good.  The location of the restaurant wasn't that great.  But I guess, you're going to go eat and not live there.  The service was nice and friendly.  I would consider going back.<//Review>

The food is delicious.  I went with a group and we ordered family style so we could sample lots of things and everything was full of flavor.  They are adding outdoor seating in a back patio, so I look forward to going back.< /review>

Came here twice, first time I loved it and second time? Still LOVED it!
Parking is pretty easy to find and the whole restaurant exterior is painted light green so you can't miss it! It's all halal and I was intrigued by the menu.

The seating is either in front or in the back patio which is fully covered yet still outside. Fells really nice. Really cozy setting kind of like a sun room!
There are booth like seating across the wall around the room.

Ordered the potato chips, homemade sauce platter, beef kabob and beef and cheese gozleme.

The potato chips are homemade, freshly made so they come out piping hot. They are crispy and soft at the same time! Would recommend this appetizer!

The homemade sauce platter was amazing. The green is a mint sauce, the white is a creamy yogurt sauce and of course the red is a spicy chili sauce. If you can't defeat the heat then do not eat the spicy sauce or you might not be around for the rest of your order. My favorite was the yogurt sauce by far. Ask for some extra yogurt because it goes amazing with your kabob!

The kabob was good. Standard beef Angus kabob. It was decent but then again you can get kabobs everywhere honestly.

Now for the Gozleme! THIS was something different!!! Usually the beef comes by itself but add cheese in there! They come in three large tortillas which are not really tortillas but the best way to describe it. The cheese is kinda sweet which meshes in well with the beef! By far my favorite dish here as I've ordered it twice!

Will be returning here soon whenever I'm down here, until then stay spicy my friends (or not)< /Text>

If you don't mind the location of the cafe it's a great place to have a wonderful meal.
We have tried :manty,pelmeni, samsa ,chicken tandoori kebob, gezlema,tandoori bread,tea. Everything was fresh and taste delicious.
Very happy discovering this place!
Definitely coming back.</review><userid>107325201416823909766<//userid><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Thank you thank you thank you! I took my 2014 jeep grand Cherokee in because it had been making a noise during acceleration. I had been to 3 other places and gotten no help. The mechanics at pro touch actually took the time to figure out what was wrong and fix it. I am very grateful! Will definitely be going back if needed and recommend them to any I know that needs a mechanic!< /review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I  am new to town and the two auto repair places that have very good and honest reputations were not able to give me an appointment as quickly as I needed it .  They both recommended Protouch Auto Repair.  I am so glad they did.  The people there were very professional and courteous.  The job that was quoted elsewhere was  for over $200 because it's an import.  (Those were out of town repair shops).  They fixed the car, in less than two hours and the price was so low I had to ask them to make sure.  Very nice people and very good mechanics</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I have serviced and repaired my utility van in this shop for the past 3 years, they do exceptional work and are very honest. My friend that's a mechanic looked at my car after this shop work on it and told me that they used all original parts that the work done was very clean.<//Text>< Pics>

< review>
Extremely slow, had my vehicle over a month and it was only after three calls and an ultimatum that they did work.  Vehicle came out running worse than when it went in.  Terrible work with equally horrible customer service will never go again.  Drivers be stay away.

Also they lost my license plate and charged me an arm and a leg only changing bulbs and battery terminals.  Also believe they lost my power steering cover but can't confirm that.<//review>

Came for a tuneup, they did very good work for my commercial vehicle, more importantly they are very honest, a little slow but you should never rush a mechanic to do quality work.</review>

She takes her time to makes sure I understand the process and doesn’t rush me when something requires a little more time; I truly feel like she cares. Tax laws change and this year was kind of a bummer with new limits and such but she was able to find me the best case scenario for the current climate. I’ll be back to see her in early 2020 :)</Review><GmapID>0x80c2b152fe0431bb:0xa26d84a26894a0e1<//GmapID><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

I'm very frustrated by the price I had to pay when adding a 10-99 form. I wasn't informed on the price increase prior to completing my taxes. When initially asked why I was using h and r block I stated I do my own taxes but because of the 10-99 form I wanted a professional to help. I should have been notified at that moment the cost increase for that form.</review>

Well the tax preparer did not seem to know what she was doing but she was nice. She seemed unsure of certain things and that made me uncomfortable, but I appreciate that she asked someone for help. Vicky was really sweet and professional, she was the highlight of my visit along with the manager who helped her with my payment. I really appreciated those two and if I do come back it will be because they put in the effort to make sure I left happy.<//review>

I've used H&R Block many times over the past few years, and it's always been a seamless and stress-free process. Thanks for making the tax process so easy so me.

This year I used the El Segundo location, and Chris Nenno was great to work with!< /Review>

This branch is cleaner than the other one, but parking is definitely a huuuuge headache here during peak hours: lunch/dinner time

Usually get the combo nengmyun + short ribs and of course the self service broth to drink while we wait for the food to come out.

Fast, easy and delicious.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2c779722c259d:0x9d26689757e5faba< /gmapID>< Date>

<rate>5< /rate><review>This was my birthday dinner that I've been craving for over 6 months! Came here for the cold noodles (NAENGMYEON) and this place did not disappoint! It was freaking delicious and filling. My family had a vegetarian bibimbap, noodle soup with chicken, and galbi. Everyone enjoyed their meal. They didn't put in the order of galbi but we mentioned it to them once we saw all the other food made it out. Just kindly inquire about it maybe after they bring out the second to last dish, and they'll sort it out. Wasn't crowded on a Tuesday night.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ3A4ZxuhLVbdAwf_f3fI5uZCpqHfIazPwXQ2V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ2hdfYUlrsQWJ_wi3Dut_xz96LQAG88W1dVGF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkrg6L1VGbhhWU7YJFM8bZreliy3oHiXtl9loY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8XfadoxPYeviMOzoFa60fkpHYjHR71X2ZQUpv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqMV579gQuVniDEqAvRdMuUc1EmwLx8urdC2qq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Food was not very good. I ordered a very flavorless soup. Server never came back to refill my empty water. He did, however, come back to grab one of the condiments I was using off my table while I was eating. (Each table has its own, it's not a take and return to a condiment table situation). Overall rude service, bad food.</review>

Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. Best cold noodles we've ever had. Could have been tastier since it was 90 out when we went. Still got hot dishes and sweated up a storm but so worth it. Also the self serve broth in a cup is so good. Did I mention their food is delicious?<//review>

I had been itching to try Yuchun for a while and finally got around to it. You're going to Yuchun for their cold noodle dishes, most likely for the mul naengmyeon (a cold, tangy, sweet beef broth surrounding chewy noodles that Yuchun makes with kudzu). I think I slightly prefer the milmyeon at Hangari Bajirak for cold broth noodles, but Yuchun is damn fine.

This is a newer location than the one on Olympic, which is reflected in the newer, shinier environs. Parking is still a major headache, though. Either drive around hoping to find something at a meter, or chance the overcrowded valet parking lot.< /text>

I knew he need to wait until most of his baby teeth were out but every place I went to for a consultation tried to scare me into getting them immediately.  PHO didn’t do that.  The staff is very kind and knowledgeable and makes sure to explain things in detail.  The office is clean and well kept.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80856167ca826fe9:0x2b473936b8083fa2</GmapID></record>

Dr. Miller is very educated in his field and steers you in the appropriate direction for the best outcome with your smile. Thanks to all the staff for making me feel welcomed the first day i arrived.

< Review>
First of all I got a appointment right away by Tiffany, and she was very polite and kind in offering what i
needed and why I was coming to see them. And once I got there they were very prepared and ready, didn't
have to wait a minute in waiting room! All went well and as I met lizzett who took my pictures it was like
being on a photo shoot. And once I met the Dr. Kan she was very nice and smiled as she talked to me and listened very carefully. All and all it was a good experience and I would like to advise others to have the same experience as I!</Review>

They were super easy and patient to schedule an appointment with and I was able to go within a week. During the consult they were super professional and made me feel comfortable and answered all of my questions. I’m excited to start my journey with braces!< /Review><UserId.>108605590225576689007< /UserId.>< pics>

Pleasant Hill Orthodontics has always been a top notch>  Now with COVID, they have implemented all the necessary CDC guidelines to remain open.  From checking in at the parking lot to waiting my turn, I felt that I was totally protected.  Drs. Miller and Kan are quite the professionals.  As an adult with certain goals for my bite, they have gone above and beyond assuring me that my goals will be reached!  I highly recommend Pleasant Hill Orthodontics.<//text>

I have really enjoyed my invisalign experience with Dr. Miller and his team.  They do their best to create an easy going relaxed environment.  Everyone there is very friendly and welcoming, and my teeth are steadily moving in the right direction.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone thinking about doing an invisalign treatment.< /Text>

Words truly can't describe all the care and love I have received from Dr. Miller and his team during my Ortho treatment. I had a pretty tough time when I first started my ortho treatment in Fremont Ca at Pannu Dental but once I started my treatment with Dr. Miller, I was so relieved and I followed him to his practice in Pleasant Hill Ca. I traveled 45 min every 2 weeks to his Clinic and never once regretted it because him and his team are amazing and their attention to their patients is impeccable. You feel that you are part of a family and you will always be taken care of. Dr. Miller is an excellent orthodontist, he walks you through your entire treatment step by step and I always felt  extremely safe and confident in his hand. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Miller and his team, if you are looking for an excellent treatment, service and care.</Review></record></dataset><record>

We had a family member in from out of town and decided on Jane for dinner . We didn't have a reservation and had a very short wait in front before being seated maybe 10 min .  Service was excellent, as well as the food. I would give more stars if I could.  I highly recommend.</Review>

I didn’t end up eating here but the food options looked excellent. They have a nice outdoor eating area too before everything went on lockdown. I will try this place next time.< /Text>

On this occasion though, it became apparent that there were a few flaws.  I had the veal marsala and my wife had the special Hawaiian swordfish.  Whilst both were tasty, the basic flavors of the meat and fish were completely shrouded by the sauces.  My veal could have been almost any light meat, the swordfish any firm fish. As I said, tasty, but a bit of a let down.
The desert, a semi-freddo with caramel was delicious,  but not a semi-fredo.
We'll go back, but without great expectations.< /Text><pics>None</pics><userid>112625530520899830968</userid><Resp>{'time': 1619462578409, 'text': 'David,\nWe appreciate your business and will pass on your comments.

Jane has great food with good presentation and flavor along with a lively yet relaxing atmosphere. They have a wonderful cocktail and drink menu. The staff is very pleasant, always there to greet you with a smile and do the most they can to make for a happy tasteful experience. Recommend for any occasion.</Review>

< Review>
Though my experience at Jane at the Marketplace has been mostly positive, today in celebration of my sister's birthday...I have a few exceptions.
First of all I must say that our server, Catherine did a very good job. She was cheery, and informative. Ditto the dude in charge running the front end.
I have always liked the environment here: big space, cloth napery and good quality glass and cutlery. A mid priced  restaurant with the class to fill the space with touches that make a difference in our overall enjoyment.
There were 4 of us today and we ordered:
Med Pizza
Blackened plank Salmon with french fries and Mango/Citrus coulis
Turkey Cobb with Gorgonzola
Red Onion Rings
Coconut Cake
Last time here i ordered the (i assume) Special Pizza which was a pretty spectacular Prosciutto, Mushrooms on a white, cheese sauce. A very delicious item. (i've attached a photo of this pizza to this review along with the Med pizza)
This Med Pizza was a major disappointment. The crust was lifeless and tasteless and was an odd tan color: as it it were whole wheat which it doesn't seem to be based on the menu description. Something was off with this dough: not leavened enough? Leavened too much?
The Buffalo Mozz was good but there just wasn't enough Olive tapenade to make an impression. Worst of all, the greens were dry when they should have been dressed. Even dressed with just olive oil, salt and pepper. Where was the Balsamic?
My sister very much enjoyed the Salmon and found the Mango/Citrus  sauce a tasty accompaniment to the fish. The Salmon was of excellent quality and grilled as ordered. A very good dish.
The Turkey Cobb was good: all of the accoutrements were prepared very well though the Gorgonzola pieces were ridiculously big. Odd to be sure. Also the Turkey was good: obviously not deli turkey but either bought or cooked in house. The greens were crispy and fresh.
The Firestone Red Onion Rings are once again pretty perfect: light, well seasoned batter but also fried very very well. This item is a prime example of a simple dish elevated to ultra goodness because all of the pieces are handled with care and in a careful, thoughtful manner.
The Coconut Cake arrived with a candle which was unlit and no one from the staff to sing Happy Birthday. Huh? a 200 buck lunch ($50 check average for each of us 4) and no one could spare the time?
Despite that, this cake is as coco-nutty as you can get. The cake itself was tender, fluffy and redolent of coconut . Both the buttercream and filling were delicious. The portion of cake sits in a milk-style sauce jam packed with coconut flavor. No artificial coconut "extracts" in sight or in the taste of this cake!
I can see  why people love this item.<//Review>

We started with their salmon pancake which is exactly what it sounds like and it was awesome. It has smoked salmon, goat cheese, a pancake base, and caviar roe. For dinner I had chicken with capers, lemon sauce, fettuccini. Wife had a seafood medley style soup. We shared a gluten free chocolate cake which was dense and very sweet.
The prices were completely reasonable, especially for the quality. The ambiance was nice as well. We sat out on the covered patio with heaters. This is a good place for a family too. We will definitely be coming back.< /text>< Pictures>

The atmosphere is casually elegant without being pretentious. The menu is thoughtfully curated which results in entrees and salads that are delightfully delicious. The service is impeccable, but I wouldn't expect anything less given the attention to detail paid to everything else throughout the restaurant.< /Review>

My husband, daughter and I ate there for the first time. The atmosphere and service were great. Super friendly and attentive. The food was not great. I had the Jane burger. The bottom bun was almost raw. The fries were over done. My husband’s pizza was bland and the crust was burned. We really wanted to like it. We were disappointed.</review>

Service was great, prompt, and friendly. Drinks were fine. The food was not good. The kitchen made some odd, bland choices. We got the mushroom pizza that I really didn't like, which is odd considering I like anything that has mushrooms on it. The quality of ingredients wasn't the problem - I just felt like the kitchen didn't know what food was.< /review>

I had the fish and chips and they were very greasy and there was something bitter in the fish flavor.  I noticed several other males what did look very good.  however I won't be able to try any other dishes I think it's worth a try<//review>< rate>

<review>Enjoyed brunch here this morning. Very very good. Atmosphere was pleasant, servers were polite and attentive. Food was outstanding. We started with the eggplant pate & olive tepanade which was incredible. I had the Frenchy omelette, perfect and the scalloped potatoes were very good. My wife had the chilequiles, and with the tomatilla sauce. She enjoyed them very much . The coconut cake with vanilla sauce to finish was the perfect way to wrap it up. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience there andand absolutely reccomend this place well.<//review><gmapID>0x80e940af8457ab2f:0x78df68aacbe9dc94<//gmapID>< Rating>

I’ve been to this restaurant twice and my experience was wonderful both times. On this visit, I ordered the Grilled Chicken plate for dinner. It was absolutely delicious. It had a light cream sauce that was delicate and complimented the Anaheim chiles and chicken. The roasted potato side had so much flavor, I could have easily eaten 10 more servings. For dessert, I had the pecan tart, which had just the right level of sweetness. The service is excellent as well, I’d highly recommend eating here!< /text>

Jane has become our "Friday night" dining special restaurant.  My sister usually orders goat cheese pancakes and I love chicken piccata with lemon caper sauce.  Recently I substituted scalloped potatoes for pasta..wow, I love the way Jane does potatoes.  We usually arrive before 5:30 so we can get in on the happy hour options.  When we leave the place is packed and there's a line out the door.

I highly recommend Jane for the food, service, and ambience.<//Review>

The burgers here are absolutely amazing. Great flavor and variety. I haven't tried their appetizers yet, but they have a large, varied selection to choose from. The location is nice, with a beautiful patio. Service is generally very good, but we have had a few experiences of having to wait a long time for follow-up twists like drink refills, the check, etc. I would highly recommend this place of you are looking for fresh, high quality food and a generally great experience.</text>

The people are nice and the place is cute, but the food was mediocre at best.  We seriously waited about 45 minutes for the food to come out and when it did the recommended steak frites were well done when we ordered medium rare.  I would not go again.<//text>

<text>Very disappointed with our experience at Jane.  We had planned to  celebrate our granddaughters birthday at Jane.  Granted we should have asked but we brought her requested family cake and was informed that the restaurant had their own pastry chef and there would be a $20 charge if we wanted to consume the cake we had brought at the restaurant.  I returned my cake to the car and thought we would make the best of it without our family cake!  Unfortunately, our experience did not improve when our dinner was served.  The food was very mediocre.  The pizza was tough and greasy, the pork sandwich was fatty and the filet was the caliber one would expect from a chain restaurant. There was no recognition of our granddaughters birthday from the restaurant,  not even a scoop of vanilla ice cream! $225 later we went home and enjoyed our traditional birthday cake. Would not recommend Jane based on our experience!< /text><UserId.>117285100636644349160< /UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< name>

don"t order the cold sparse crab lunch salad. the large piece of warm salmon salad would have been great. should have sent mine back. skimpy and too much dressing. the prices on their web site are way off too. not $19 but $23 for hardly any substance in my plate. i may go back but not for the meal I chose. expected the choices to all be good. oh well live & learn.</text>

<user_name>Ed Miskevich</user_name><Review>This is a good choice if you are in the Goleta area.  We shared the oysters to start, and for the main courses we had the flank steak in chimichurri sauce and the mixed seafood and vegetable stew in coconut cream broth. All were excellent. The wine list was very good, in fact it was better than at a more expensive restaurant we dined at off State Street in downtown SB.</Review>< rate>

<review>Jane is one of the best Farm to Table places in Santa Barbara. Their food quality is great and it is always fresh. The only reason my rating is low is two times I have been served chicken in my vegetarian order for which they apologised but that doesn't change the fact that the Waitress made a mistake.
Anyway, I still go there occasionally but everytime I am there my fear of having issues with my order are always doubled.<//review>< Pics>

The food was good not great. I had the smoked salmon and prawn salad. The service was not good at all. We sat there waiting to be acknowledged but the server waited the 15 minutes for the happy hour to end even though the pair of ladies next to me ordered off the happy hour menu. It was disappointing.< /review>

<Review>The few times that I went, the food did not live up to the downtown location. Everything is just a little off. For example, the chicken picatta is tasty but super greasy and the burgers were good, but since they were out of buns, we ate them on ciabatta.

Service is pleasant in the restaurant, but when we tried to plan a private party there, the communication was terrible, and I felt we were treated badly and blamed for things that weren’t communicated to us properly. Fortunately, we had a mountain of email evidence that proved it wasn’t our fault, and only then did they become apologetic. It was ultimately resolved to our (somewhat) satisfaction, but I was disappointed in the customer service overall.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1556658760255, 'text': 'Lani I am sorry about your experience and sincerely hope you will give us another try.'}<//Response>< Rate>

I feel badly writing this because I've always been fond of this restaurant, however last Friday I was turned down at the door because they could not accommodate my baby in his stroller. The patio was closed due to the fire and they had a private party in the other room, however there were tables available in the main room and the hostess turned us away. I feel this is definitely a form of discrimination.<//text>

I have loved these family recipes for 20+ years. Faves are pasilla chiles, goat cheese pancakes, and coconut cake...with raspberry sauce on the side!< /review>

<Text>This is the second inedible meal I've had at Jane. I had the fresh fish sandwich. It was not fresh! Coated with so much mayonnaise and butter I couldn't taste the fish. It made me feel sick to eat that much mayonnaise. I told the waitress and only ate 2 bites but they didn't adjust the bill at all. Not impressed.<//Text>< pictures>

The food is great! What's really outstanding though is the COVID era packaging. Each item individually boxed, put inside a larger cardboard box, and taped down complete with a friendly sticker and instructions on how to best enjoy your food later. The free soda was wrapped in a napkin then foil so it stays cold and not wet with condensation. Serious amount of care put into making sure your boxes aren't tipping over before you get home< /Review>

Today 2/2/2021 was my first time trying this place. I found them online. I couldn't have been less impressed. The food was over price for the very small portions that we received and lacked flavor. I drowned my shrimps in ponzu sauce in an effort to eat it. I ended up throwing it out in the trash and eating cereal. For $67.13 I was VERY disappointed! My first and last time eating from here. The only good thing I have to say was the packaging was VERY covid friendly.</review>

Food served here seems to be a fusion of Chinese and Korean. Very tasty and reasonable pricing. Courtious and fast service.< /Review>

Excellent quality, price, generous portion, and friendly service. I wish I had discovered this hidden gem in Gardena a long time ago! I will definitely return many times over! The black bean noodles and spicy noodle soup are the two best dishes in town, hands down! During this time of Covid-19 pandemic, it offers delivery service through 4 major meal delivery service companies (if you have extra money to burn). There is ample parking so pickup is not an issue.<//text>

Wow!!
This food played a loud orchestra in our mouth!
We order the spicy seafood soup, yes it was spicy!
We also order the Black Bean noodles.
Fried Dumplings, crispy from the outside and soft from inside.
The service is good, the whole staff is very friendly.
The only thing they are missing is some kimchi!
The place is clean.
We will come back and highly recommend this spot.
The prices are reasonable.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It is good to have a light taste without using beauty.

The sauce is important for Jjajangmyeon and it's well made and delicious with noodles.

Ganjajang is not bad. There are a lot of onions.

Add a little bit of vinegar with the meat of the right size and mix it well.

Sweet and sour pork
The crunchy texture is good.

The dumplings are fried crispy well

This restaurant specializes in Chinese cuisine.

The tables in the restaurant are small but they are also in high demand.

The friendly service is great for the guests.

Free soda events are also available.

I think you can refer to the event in the restaurant.

Parking is free.

Let's try cool champon again.

미원을 쓰지 않고 담백한 맛을 내는 음식이 좋습니다.

짜장면은 소스가 중요한데 잘 만들어져 면과 함께 맛있게 드실 수 있습니다.

간짜장도 나쁘지 않아요 양파가 조금 많기는 하지만 간짜장의 고유한 맛을 느낄 수 있어서 좋습니다.

적당한 크기의 고기와 함께 식초를 조금 넣고 잘 비벼서 드시면 더욱 맛있게 드실 수 있습니다.

탕수육은 찍먹이죠~
바삭바삭한 식감이 좋습니다.

만두도 아삭하게 잘 튀겨져 나왔네요

전체적인 맛이 좋은 중화요리 전문점입니다.

식당 내 테이블은 적지만 배달 수요가 많은 곳이기도 합니다.

친절한 서비스는 손님에게 즐거움을 주니 더욱 좋네요.

소다 무료 이벤트도 하고 있습니다.

식당 내 이벤트를 참고하시면 될 것 같네요

주차는 무료입니다.

시원한 짬뽕을 먹으로 또 가봐야겠습니다.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I searched for a nearby area with Google, but it is said that I received a new takeover a month ago. They say that they only prepare and sell the ingredients that day, so if the ingredients run out, the door closes. Luckily I arrived before the ingredients ran out!! Just taste the pork in sweet and sour pork and jajangmyeon!! Find out. Very fresh fish ♡ I can't even catch anything. Especially, Jajangmyeon noodles... It's not a joke. What? What? I was admiring the tangle and tangle noodles, but when I asked, he pulled the shaving himself. The machine costs 6000 dollars. I don't know if it's good for 6000 dollars. I really can't forget the thickness and chewy texture of this noodles. It's delicious too, but maybe it's because the boss, who had more than 12 years of waitress experience... Read the customer's heart and service beyond expectations.. I became a regular at once.

It was a short conversation during a meal, but I met the boss who treated me with heart and heart, and my heart was full♡

I'll see you again next time^^

구글로 가까운 지역 탐색해서 다녀왔는데 1달전 새롭게 인수인계 받으셨다고 합니다. 그날 재료만 준비해서 팔아서 재료 떨어지면 문닫는다고 하시네요. 저는 운 좋게도 재료 떨어지기 전 도착!! 탕수육이랑 짜장면에 들어간 돼지고기 맛 보고 딱!! 알아봄요. 완전 신선한 고기♡잡내도 하나도 안나고요. 특히 짜장면 면발.. 장난아님요. 뭐지? 뭐지?  하며 탱글탱글 면에 감탄하고 있었는데 여쭤보니 면도 직접 뽑으신데요. 기계가 6000불짜리래요. 6000불 짜리면 좋은 면이 나오는건지 모르겠지만요. 정말 이 면의 두께와 쫄깃거림은 잊을 수가 없을듯요. 넘 맛있기도 한데 12년 이상의 웨이트리스 경력이 있으셨던 사장님이 셔서 그런지.. 고객 마음 쏙쏙 읽으시고 기대 이상의 서비스 .. 정말 단번에 단골 되었습니다.

식사중의  짧은 대화였지만 마음과 마음으로 대해주는 사장님 만나 마음도 풍성했습니다♡

다음에 또 찾아뵐게요^^</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I do not like the taste of the sauce. The sauce is made with sweet and sour sauce, so it is tough and the taste is not fresh. Udon saves the ingredients and cuts the squid too thin to taste the seafood.

<text>(Translated by Google) Where the owner is seen and messed up

Prices are rising and taste is not good.

The owner is far from kind and the owner is

A place where customers who have not given a tip are insulted and really unlucky.

(Translated by Google) The taste of food is different every time. There is no basic courtesy. When I told the owner that the champon soup wasn't seasoned, the kid who works in the kitchen sometimes responds as if it was natural. As if I didn't know what was wrong...

매번 음식맛이 다르네요. 기본예의가없어요. 짬뽕국물이 간이없어 주인에게 말했더니 주방에서 일하는아이가 가끔그런다고 당연하다는듯 답하네요. 역시 잘못이뭔지모른다는듯...< /Review>

The price & location to my daughter was excellent.  The room was fairly clean, however the floor was sticky, so bring old socks to wear.  Probably too much soap on the laminate.  The fridge, that we paid more to have, was stuck on a too cold setting and exploded my bright colored sparkling water!  Bring your ear plugs; there is highway noise. Overall, I would stay again due to location.</review>

We slept well and the room was fairly quiet. The bathroom was clean. There was hair in a couple of places and that completely grosses me out. The manager gave us a discount because we had such a difficult time from going from their hotels. Their staff was really friendly. The sheets didn't feel crisp. Expedia dropped the ball, so I'm glad Motel 6 helped us out, just a little more detail to the sheets, the cleaning.</Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>The more popular and obvious locations are not as peaceful as it should. The location draws more folks who are looking for close attractions to the location. I would recommend using some of the other locations Motel 6 has. Many of the more secluded ones are more conducive to having a good nights rest and to not be disturbed. Went to one that was closer to common path and that has proven to be disruptive and didn't get a good nights rest. Overall, Motel 6 is practical and satisfactory.< /Text>< pics>

Not near anything very cool. Convenience store pretty close. Water pressure? There was none. Wouldve been nice to be forewarned of the roof work they were doing and that it started at 8am. What a rude wake up call.<//Text>

<Text>There were more handicap parking spaces than we usually see. The room was small but completely handicap accessible. The bed however was supposed to be queen but it must've been an rv sized one, it was tiny. The linens were little more than rags and there was mold on the ceiling above the shower.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHTa7p-orK7aFL8tLwAOlUwKx7Bxz-rubYJide=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbYR1RNk0_ETuWyWCuKoiw3g7djkVYHWmOzPsZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMS5Pm7uiWepJKmcElhcASISoZhQtt2asigZpI_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

The front desk  apologized and comped us a room and tried to replaced items lost. .. which made us a lot happier.  Thanks motel 6</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>It was disgusting! Roaches! Dirty! They offered to switch my room to the opposite side of the wall! Like that fixes the REALLY bad roach problem! Customer service needs to be educated there as well as the day manager on how to treat guests. Pay $20 more and go across the street!!!!!<//Review>< GmapID>

The room was comfy and clean. The bathroom looked like it had some recent updates to it. Staff was courteous and friendly and you couldn't beat the price for being labor day weekend. We will definitely stay here again next time we're in town.</Review>

<Rate>None<//Rate><text>I was very disappointed in our stay. We stay at Motel 6 quite frequently and have never had any issues. This stay however, especially during the pandemic, was concerning. The cleanliness of the room was very worrisome. Didn't appear to have been swept, there were large pieces of trash under the bed, and under the microwave was disgusting. A few hours after we arrived there was a yellow/brown liquid that that was in the base of the shower (was not there when we arrived). I even killed a cockroach and two earwigs. I'm glad I brought Clorox wipes with me, I disinfected every surface I could find. I always try to give every business the benefit of the doubt, but in these times it just didn't live up to expectations.< /text>< pics>

<Review>First, never trust anything they promise you in advance. They do not live up to anything they promise. Change rooms, change prices, change things impacting your health---its pretty bad. Second, lots of low life stay here. Third, while some of the people working here are okay, the ones that give you the shaft on what they promised you do it with that syrupy sweet voice that makes me sick. Its kind of like a mannequin with a frozen smile that could care less about you.

Other than that, enjoy your stay.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The motel was you'd expect; clean, efficient and helpful staff. You pretty much know what you'll get with Motel 6 and it's good value.
The location was fine with a nice bakery close by and a whole foods down the way which helps.</review>

Stay away. There were no rooms available at check in time (and I reserved 2). After 1 1/2 hrs one room was ready and was told that the other room would be ready in 15 mins. We are a party of 7 and had to get ready for an event that evening. Needless to say, the second room was not ready by the time we had to leave for the event and left without freshening up and changing clothes!!
When we returned, we opened up the motel room with a terrible order of cigarette smoke even though it was a non smoking room. We had to spray air freshener and that really didn’t make a difference; it still stunk!!  So after it took over an hour and a half to get the room ready, it wasn’t even clean. The floor was dirty, it felt like sand on the floor, there was a shoe under one bed along with dust bunnies and the other one had trash. The towel holder in the bathroom had dead bugs in it; didn’t feel they were clean to use.
Save your money even if it’s free, go somewhere else!!</Review>

A homeless man knocked on my door 2 times in the night and I called the front desk in the morning and the man told me I shoulda called in the night I was sleepy and didnt know thr was rules to call.

I was welcomed and thanked and treated so well. I am blown away at how friendly everyone was here. They had beach balls in the pool for 4th of July and my little kids had a blast in the pool. My neighbor was a little loud - The front desk took care of it right away. Very fun stay for me and my little family.</Review>

When I registered it was for a queen bed. When we arrived, the desk clerk processed us, and when we opened the door it was a one double bed. I immediately went to front desk and informed the clerk. She then moved us to a room with 2 double beds. Still not what I paid for. We had to accept it as no other rooms available. That night the person in the room above us was having a shouting, stomping, moving things, pounding on the walls. We called the front desk and told the clerk but, nothing was done to remedy the situation.<//Review>

We booked 2 rooms, one of which was smoked in and knowing that my reservation was with kids I would have expected that the staff pay attention to details and not allocate a room for a family with children a smoked room.  I know you can't control people smoking in room but you can air the room or give it to some who are not with children.

The non carpeted rooms looked amazing in the picture until I found hair in the corners indicating that cleaning is not done well.  The management couldn't not even replace an eight dollar toilet seat from home depot; our bathroom had no toilet seat! Mold was growing all over the shower which is usually an easy fix with some bleach and air.  A room for 4 people had only 2 towels.... Bed we're pushed against the wall so no space for anything else.

Worst place I have ever experienced, however I was there for graduation so this was the cheapest option at $200 a night per room.  Knowing how big the Motel 6 brand is I did not expect the price and moreover the issues.  To pay $200 for a dirty room without a toilet seat is what bothers me most. Even the small size was OK.

To top is all off, having a grumpy pregnant women on front desk on the busiest weekend is not a smart move form management, have her do something else instead! I understand that you can not discriminate but you can make a smarter kinder to her decisions.

Won't be recommending nor stying again.<//Text>

Upon walking into the room, there was a nasty odor he said it was a smoking room and i often smoke cigarettes from time to time but the smell was of Meth and i mean bad and recently! I pull the sheets back and there are stains and human hair which concerns me to if they cared to wash the sheets or not then i dig around and check the floors and yep i found a broken Dope pipe a d the sink leaked and just imagined being blamed for that after check out. I will never stay here again amd advise you not too!!!< /review>

Room was clean, bed was beyond comfortable, I appreciated the TV channels since I don't have cable at home and it was nice to indulge a little.  My only complaints were how tiny the shower was and that I had to buy my own shampoo and conditioner.  Really?  I have never in my whole life not been given these items and was super irritated that I had to get re-dressed and go pay for them.  This bothered me so much that I had to lower my overall rating.<//review>

Cheaper than the other Motel 6 across the street! Seems to have nicer rooms than the other one too. The room had its own microwave and refrigerator. It's a little noisy being by the freeway. Plenty of parking. What else can you say it's Motel 6! Get what you pay for... A decent place to stay for a decent price.</Review>

This was s great place to stay. Most important for me was the cleanliness and the desk staff at check in and check out. The rooms were very clean and fresh and the staff was friendly and welcoming. Location was very easy to get around. This was my first experience with Motel 6 and if the are all like this one, I will definitely be using them more often when I travel. I was surprised that the room had no hair dryer or even a shower cap, but I'll. Ring my own on future trips.<//Review>

It was clean , we had a nice TV in our room , the walls were pretty thin  . My only complaint was there is no fridge or cooler in the rooms so you have to go to the lobby for water .<//review>

After 3 hours driving to get there, we were exhausted and ready to rest.
Well the bedrooms smelled terrible ( smoking + humid).
After change our bedroom, because we saw bunch of curly and gross ( pubic hair ) under the sheets.
The second one was even worst. The same smells and looks like someone has bloody hands and touched the bathroom walls.
You get what you pay for! But that was just disgusting</text>

<Text>Minus the lack of refrigerator in the rooms and there only being a microwave in the lobby, this was a decent motel. The beds are comfortable. The rooms were clean. The rooms me and the others that I was with stayed in had hardwood floors. No tub. It was fairly quiet. The ac and heater worked well.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< rating>

Good location for on and off the freeway.  4 miles for Cal Poly and downtown SLO.  The room was not the cleanest.  We were originally placed in a non smoking room that stunk.  They changed us right away, and were apologetic.  The second room smelled much better.  The card key worked once, then didn't work.  I felt in our short stay (2 nights), we were in the office quite a bit!  The office staff we ran into were nice and helpful.  The cleaning staff removed our old soap and didn't replace it with a new soap.  Again another trip to the front office!  No shampoo in the room.  Overall, ok experience.  Don't know that I will stay here again.  Plenty of other accommodations in the area.<//text>

We couldn’t figure out the free WiFi for the PlayStation and I had mentioned it to the front desk on my way out to get food. The young man at the front desk (I wanna say Hector, but I honestly can’t remember his name), came to the room (after he called first) to help my son set up the FREE WiFi. They gave us extra pillows, extra towels and just made a long drive from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo a very memorable and enjoyable experience. Thank you entire staff at Motel 6 North.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

Room worked for a quick lay-over.  Road and parking lot noise was a bother.  Lighting on wall behind the bed was not behind the bed...it was way over to the side.  New rounded shower was wonderful.  Plenty of room and no sharp objects to bump-into.  Visible from Hwy. 101, so was easy to find.< /text>

This is one of Motel 6's quiet locations. Although it's very convenient to highway 101, the rooms are very quiet. I have stayed three times at this location, and have been very pleased with the rates, the quality of the room, and the courtesy of the front desk staff.<//Text>

We stay at Motel 6 quite often and usually, we have quite a nice experience.  That's what keeps us coming back ... but, unfortunately, this time we had a few hick-ups.

1)  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!  We usually stay at Motel 6 for budgeting reasons ... this time, the prices were just too high!  Even though there is an event in town, the prices shouldn't be hiked up so very much!
2)  Shower wasn't as clean.  A simple final rinse from the cleaning crew would have been nice.
3)  Water dripping from light above/inside shower.  Was it from the shower upstairs?
4)  Refrigerator didn't work very well.  Just another observation.

Will we go back?  Of course.  And, like I said, we always do -- just, please take my points as strong suggestions.<//review>

So, when I first checked into the room, the floors were a little dirty.  I didn't make a fuss.  I ended up checking out a day early and left mid afternoon.  As I was packing, I noticed that a commemorative lighter I had purchased from a local shop was missing.  I spoke to the manager about it.  He then questioned the head housekeeper since they had cleaned my room earlier that morning.  No lighter.  I didn't loose it... or mistakenly pack it.  It was taken.  I didn't expect the housekeeper to admit taking it since it might have cost them their job... but it just sucked!  If you stay here, secure anything you consider valuable.<//Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>All in all it was a pleasant experience after overcoming the first few unfortunate events. I was initially given a room with a water leak in the bathroom ceiling. The second room smelled so badly of smoke (even though I had requested a non-smoking room), I had to ask for a change again on my way out for the evening (the shower floor also looked dirty).  The clerk was very nice, apologized and assigned me to my third room, but forgot to write down the room number. Upon returning to the hotel after a night out, I could not remember my room number exactly-- and tried getting into the wrong room. Of course the key didn't work, so an attendant tried to help me with no success.  We then called the front desk and they were finally able to identify my correct room number and get me situated.  After that, all was well.  The room was clean, didn't smell of smoke, and the bed was comfortable.  I liked the bright, modern decor and the minimal design.  The room did not have a blow dryer, complimentary shampoo, or a coffee pot (coffee was free in the lobby).  Although you could ask for a blow dryer at the reception desk, I didn't know this until I checked out.  I do like this place for a no frills sleep over and next time will be better prepared. The staff were super-friendly and fortunately able to have back-up rooms for my situation despite a really busy open house weekend at Cal Poly.</review><user_id>117159304209186091437<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d<//Gmap_id><time>1491856520109< /time><user_name>Laura Emery</user_name><Rating>4</Rating><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

We stayed at the motel 6 on 1433 Calle Joaquin in San Luis Obispo this past weekend.  Our first room had a brown sticky bad smelling substance on the sheets.  See picture. And the 2nd room we were moved to, was filthy.  My husband also found a bug in the towel he was trying his face with.  After multiple attempts, we spoke to the manager.  She blew us off.  Even told us not to bother calling corporate because they would send it back to her.  I think the hotel needs to be checked out for cleanliness.  It was just gross overall.
I need to know who to contact as I want a refund on our room.  The manager first offered 50% back, then changed it to 30%.   She told us if we want more back we have to call Wednesday and speak to the general manager.  At this point it like to speak to someone higher up.</text>

The staff was so helpful.  It was a crazy weekend (SLO graduation) yet the coffee was wonderful - the iron was new, they were kind and accommodating!  Thank you so much for making our stay terrific.  I had three rooms.

Plus the management understands that everyone is working hard to be financially responsible.< /review>

Our room smelled heavily like clorox when we entered it but there was black hair all over the bathroom floor and in the shower stall. I spoke to the person at the front desk who told me to call the manager later in the day.    The manager should have called me.< /text>

I thought the front desk lady was nice and checking in went smoothly. The rooms were clean! But the man who was doing housekeeping kept trying to come into my room before checkout. The first time he knocked early in the morning and we told him that we aren’t leaving until noon, then when I went to go get breakfast the cleaning guy walked into my room without knocking and my suitemate was in there. Other than that I paid a good price for a last minute trip.</Text>

There were cigarette burns on the blanket, hairs on the bed sheet. The room also smelled like cigarette even though it was a non-smoking room. I will probably book a hotel nearby if I come back to the area again.</Text>< Pictures>

I was so tired when I got there very sticky floors dirty, I go notify the front desk for asking when I got there I had just got there my daughter was in the shower and they said I could switch rooms to upstairs only thing is I was going to be able to carry on this stuff upstairs I was not feeling well not only exhaustion I had medical issues going on, they said they couldn't enter the room with it being occupied so I asked if I could mop it myself they said sure but they only use a dry mop and spray bottle that's how they clean their floors that's really gross this is the coronavirus x everything I wiped I didn't even use that mop because it just wasn't going to be enough everything I wiped was filthy dirty it's not a safe place to stay you can hear everything feels like someone's watching you no privacy no peace of mind doesn't feel homey I mean it's not an expensive hotel but it's not the cheapest and for the price you should at least get cleanliness there was no blanket it was just very uncomfortable and dirty and no matter how much I clean the floor I went through like 6 bath towels to clean it it was still filthy.<//review>

<text>When driving in rate says 55.99 but I was charged online fir 82.00 for 1 adult and 2 children. My family and I use motel 6 slot and you can usually get the room cheaper online but calling the 800 number I was charged 20 dollars more than usual. Over all they are usually good but I suggest when customers call and say the posted night rate says 55.99 you honor what you have posted regardless of whether you say you are full you still advertised 55.99...not happy this time around.</text>< pics>

I was very pleased to meet the desk clerk at this location. I drive long distances and it is nice when everything goes easy and as expected. I actually brought them a pizza as the local pizza place has a by one get one special. Not many locations have I felt this way about this one stood out.< /Review>

I had a one night stay , the front desk lady wasn't rude but just looked like she didn't want to be there . Which I've stayed here before a few times but it's been a while and before front desk was for the most part really friendly and welcoming. The room were clean and smelled good. Oh and at some time at night I get a knock on the door saying front desk (actually a bang) got a little scared so it took me a while so had the safety lock and open it just a little bit no one was there , I was so tired and sleeping that I just went back to sleep and never called front desk to see if it was them and what did they need . Si overall it was okay.< /Review>

When I stayed here it was clean and comfortable. Does not have landscape like the one up the street but its clean. The repair man helped me open my window polite. Close to downtown cost $12 to uber there. Check out time is now 11am and that's ok but I didn't know it. I would stay here again<//Review>

We have a family member who use to work for Motel 6, and he took great pride in doing a good job.  His Motel 6 is still very clean and well kept.  I checked in and first thing I noticed was that the floors were not clean.  Their was hair and other dirt all along the edges of the bathroom, under the beds hadn't been cleaned for ages and there was a thick layer of filth.  The drain in the bathroom sink couldn't drain because of debris obstructing it.  The toilet seat was loose so it played slip and slide when you sat on it and it will break loose at some point and you better hope it isn't someone who will end up on the floor with an injury.  The otherwise white shower stall showed evidence of pink slime.  There were 2 of us checked in, but only towels for one.  I asked for another at the front desk but was told they couldn't assist me with that.  During the night, someone vomited in one of the stairwells, and I had to use an alternative route around it.  when I checked out 6 hours later it was still there even after notifying staff. The concrete surfaces are in need of a power wash, and even the doormats are filthy. We had just spent the previous nights at a different Motel 6 on our route that was well maintained and clean.  This site is an outlier and in need of remedial action.  Certainly not worth what I paid for it in comparison to the rates at other motels in the area.< /text>

<Review>The staff was friendly and accommodating with allowing a late check out, however when it comes to the room it’s another story. There were ants in the bathroom and on the ceiling in the main room. The tv did not display any content when scrolling through the channels, and the sheets had stains and crumbs on it. All and all it did the job but not worth the price I had paid.< /Review><Response>None</Response><UserId.>114010976820715317792</UserId.><rate>2</rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

It was a very pleasant experience due to our current circumstances commuting between North and South County due to work...this motel is just down the street from our weekend job which makes our weekend commute a smooth transition from living in North County on weekdays.We would very much like to set up a monthly reservation which help us to continue loyalty to your Motel 6.I hope we can work something out for the next 6 months.</Review>

Room was never cleaned during our entire stay.  The young man who was doing the cleaning was overwhelmed so it wasn't his fault that he never made it to our room.  Also, in his defense, he promptly took out our garbage, gave us clean towels, and tidied up a bit as we were coming back from a very long day.  We left at 5am each day and when we returned at 6pm, nothing had been done in our room.  When I told the Indian lady when I checked out, she smiled to add insult to injury.  I have stayed at this location several times before, but never again.  Understaffing and charging that much for accomodations is not acceptable.< /text>

Staff was nice pleasant and helpful. Room appeared clean until closer inspection. Lots of hair left in bathroom around sink. The bed sheets also had lots of hair from various people. Hair in shower. Hair inbedded in the remote control buttons.  Towels were also stained and had traces of hair. Grossed out but you get what you pay for?</text>

I read several reviews and all I have to say is this is a MOTEL people! For a motel the  service was excellent the property looked clean. The room was clean. They allowed my dog. Needed to find a restaurant the clerk helped me find one. Second night went to a wedding , came back and people noisy outside called front desk and they handled it. OVERALL GREAT !!!!<//Text>

<review>The Good: Clean room, very comfortable bed with nice pillows and bedding as well. Nice TV, although a local news channel would be good.

The Bad: something buzzed or vibrated, loudly, in the wall that separated the main room from the bathroom. If you touched the wall, you could feel the wall vibrating. I'm guessing it might be a recirculating hot water pipe? It happened one night at 4 a.m., and the next night from 10 p.m to about midnight. I mentioned it to the desk clerk / manager when I checked out.

One other gripe was the weekend room rate jumping up an extra $90 per night. I recognize its summer in a popular place, but more than doubling the room rate seemed excessive and makes the place not the usual good deal. On another weekend visit, I'd be seriously tempted to consider another hotel.<//review>< Rating>

So I definitely love that this is a dog friendly motel aaaand I think that's just about all that I loved about it. I realize motel 6 is nothing fancy and it's very basic and that's really all I needed however there are super sketchy people everywhere and when I took my dog to go to the bathroom I saw a tweeker getting banged out by some dude and what I think was the laundry area... So I think I'm good on staying here again. Dont recommend.< /text>

We were pleasantly surprised at this Motel 6.  It was basic, but very clean with a nice bathroom & lots of clean towels.  We had our 2 small dogs with us and there was no problem with them at all.  There was a grassy area for them to walk on to do their business in the back of the motel.  Everyone working there was very pleasant.  For the price, we were very happy.<//Text>

<review>I spent some time to book or reserve the rooms online. It was late at night when I got there so I was hoping to go check in and be able to get to my room and sleep. It took close to twenty minutes to get our keys for each room. I asked for non smoking and we ended up having to take smoking rooms because none of the other rooms were cleaned. So we that we were good once we got to the room but they ended up giving us a dirty room, so we had to go back down and get another one.
We weren't looking for much but a comfy bed and clean room to sleep but it didn't turn out that way at all. Location was fine, no surprises. But check-in was way too long.</review>< pics>

< review>
I had to find a hotel last minute due to a poor experience with an Airbnb host. The prices were reasonable and they had a room for the entire requested time of my stay. The staff was super friendly, and we had a regular house keeper that stopped by once or twice a day to make sure we had enough towels. He was very accommodating, and knew that my kids would need more towels coming back from the beach. Overall, very friendly and never intrusive.</review>

The room was clean and the staff was outstanding! We had several requests and they met them all without question, including David, who filled several different roles, including manning the front desk. I would definitely stay again if ever back in San Luis Obispo.< /Review>

This motel ripped us off.  They charged my grandaughter for two rooms for the same night.  When asked why they said that was their holiday price.  Our receipt clearly shows they charged for two rooms.  My room was only 92 for a double, hers was 153 for a single. Rooms smelled, bedding was not clean.  This is a NO star place, but it won't let you post if you don't  give it one< /text>

Pretty much a standard roadside motel.

Good location, rooms away from the highway are quiet.

Clean, decent, safe and sanitary.

Weakest coffee I've ever seen. No "Do Not Disturb" signs.

Soap only in bathroom - bring your own hair products etc.< /Review>

<review>The room was decent. It was clean and had the micro-fridge as advertised. This is a no-frills kinda place. There is wifi but only if you pay extra for it. They didn't have extra pillows or blankets, stating they had "run out", which is possible since the place was pretty full. I'd only stay here again if it was the only place with rooms available, which is why I stayed here in the first place. Not bad, not great, but much better than sleeping in my car.< /review>< pics>

The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating, but that's where the good ends. The price was $113 for a Saturday night stay booked in advance - that's expensive for a motel, but super expensive for how dirty and uncomfortable this room was.

The room was neatly made up, but it had clearly not been cleaned properly. The floor was disgustingly dirty - we didn't realize just how bad it was until we took our shoes and socks off to shower (picture attached) - the hardwood floor felt like it hadn't been swept or mopped in months.

The shower was dirty, with hair in the drain and recent dirt stains (not the permanent kind, the kind you can wipe off with a rag). The towels had multiple stains and were so rough it was clear their usefulness as towels had long passed.

There was a roach under my son's bed - roaches don't bother me that much, but they really bothered my young son, who almost didn't want to sleep in the room any more. That was a hassle I definitely didn't want to deal with.

The parking lot had a lot of trash and debris and the pool area looked like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile.

Finally, they offered kids lollipops in the registration office, but I took a look at the container and the lollipops all looked like they had had their wrappers removed and then re-wrapped. One of them was put back in with no wrapper at all! (picture attached).

Overall, this Motel 6 is much dirtier and more uncomfortable to stay in that most Motel 6s I've been in, especially when you consider it's in San Luis Obispo, which is a beautiful town. Not worth the money. Spend another $20 or $30 and book at an actual hotel.</text>

Our stay was predictably nice, no problems with staff, cleanliness, coffee, etc.
Except for one thing: The towels are kept in a yellow box hanging on the wall, with holes in it for towels. The bottom part of each cubby was dusty when I came in - didn't check the 2nd day.<//review>

<Review>Low ratings due to the heavy cigarette smell. Our first non smoking room smelled so bad we had to change rooms. Only one wash cloth in a double room. Maybe dust the towel holder on the inside. Otherwise clean. For the price I still expect a small shampoo and lotion in the bathroom.

Positive- the air conditioner worked, the morning coffee was good and the front office staff friendly.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

Positives: Front desk staff were extremely friendly. We only visited with them to check in and out.
No frills - sometimes they have a refrigerator which would have been nice. Only issues:
AC: when on - was freezing for the bed right up against the AC.
Window: didn't open - we probably wouldn't have used the AC if the window would have opened.
Neighbor Sat & Sun night left the TV on loud all night. Finally called him 2nd night around 4am after not being able to get back to sleep for about an hour - had to call twice (1st time he didn't answer, just hung up) but he did turn it off. When I mentioned this to the front desk staff at 5:30 when we checked out, they were extremely apologetic and told us we should have called them - that they would have handled it 1 way or the other.
Price: Rooms in this town on Memorial Day are pricey. Most other hotels were much more. Still...at $140 a night (for a Motel 6?) + tax would have like a refrigerator.< /review>

We paid $590 for 2 nights. That is more than we normally pay but it was all we could find because of graduation ceremonies. We walked into room and first impression was a dirty bed spread with big stains all over it. There were 2 dirty towels in the bathroom.
Our experience with Motel 6 has been very positive in the past. And at other locations.
We probably won’t return to this location.</review>

<rating>4</rating><text>The Motel 6 in San Luis Obispo is located on Calle Joaquin and is in sort of an out-of-the-way place but it's quiet there so that's a plus. The rooms themselves are clean but they are kind of dated and they little maintenance. The card key system for the door locks is Goofy and should be replaced. There is a convenience store close by and Margie's Diner is just down the way which is a good place to eat. In general it is a very good economical place to stay in my books there is a pool but it doesn't get used too​ much it is clean though.<//text>< pics>

<Review>The front desk check in employee was fabulous. Very positive and easy going. The site is well lit - with a car dealership next door. Did I mention the lights?  The black-out curtains in the room work - Yeah.  The room was clean and minimal. Another blanket available would have been nice. By the time I realized I wanted one, it was late and the fire dept. police, ambulance was on premises for a hotel guest so I stayed put and wore a sweatshirt to bed. Got settled in and turned on the T.V. only to find many streaks of color on the picture tube. The audio/visual would delay as well. Kind of a stop and start happening. I changed channels to see if would improve, but it was like this throughout each channel. I turned it off and on to see if this would help. Naaaa.  So read my book and went to bed. Woke up to the car dealership washing their vehicles and the employees loudly talking to each other near by the fence which separates the property.  Shower was clean and water was warm.<//Review>< pictures>

Grounds look dirty; cigarette butts, old clothes lying on stairs,  coffee stains on walkway, beds could be newer/better. Front desk clerk said he would call in 10 minutes to ensure our room is okay but he never called. I do like the fact that there is no carpeting...that was fantastic.</Text>

<Review>The service especially at the front counter was very very good. The front counter personnel were very helpful when I asked for help. The room was clean. Sometime during the early morning hours some people in one of the adjoining rooms were having a very expressive and audible sexual experience. I had two other reservations in different Motel 6 locations that weekend which were very very good so I hate to complain about this one instance but would mention it if telling other people about the stay in San Luis Obispo.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

For the middle of October, I felt the daily rate was outrageously high.  One bed for one person should not cost over $100.  No carpeting, no decor, shower only, this is supposed to be economical.  It is not, and I will re-consider future plans to stay at Motel 6.</Text>

Horrible stay, will not be back. We would rather sleep in vehicle. Bed was hard, nothing in the room, tv didn't work on most channels and they are doing construction so at 7AM we were awakened by jack hammering and had to walk an extra block to get to our vehicle.</review>

The bed was so uncomfortable The floors were dirty the bathroom was moldy the shower leaked everywhere and the freeway traffic noise was obnoxious.  Even poor people who can only afford $75 a night should not have to stay in accommodations this awful.  I would not recommend this motel to my worst enemy. I think the president of Motel 6 should have the experience of staying there. You would think that such a rich city like SLO would have higher standards.  I have stayed in a lot of the renovated motel 6 locations on the west coast and this was by far the worst.</text></record>

Having stayed at motel 6, many times in past years , I was disappointed at the condition at this location. 1) no toilet tissue 2) cigarette burn on bed spread 3) dirty floor 4) mosquitos in the room. On the positive side, a young man in the office, was helpful in directing me to Costco for a delicious salad for my dinner, I am so pleased that I am able to travel with my small, well behaved, poodle and stay with her at Motel 6. On my way to AZ, I spent the night in Blythe, CA, at Donlon St, 92225. Everything was delightful, there, in every way. See want them to be properly complimented.  Thank you! Karen Jackson< /text>

6 of us arrived & all six were told at different times that there were no 1 bed rooms cleaned & we could get a 2 bed room for more money. This was 6pm. All of us had confirmation numbers for 1 Queen bed rooms.
They said i had not pick the bed choice, yet i also had a confirmation number for my room & 1 single queen bed.
Seemed very fishy & unprofessional. All of us got 1 bed rooms after we protested . The rest of the motel was just fine.<//Text>

<Review>When I checked in, I was informed that the rate I had booked the room for had changed and that when you make a reservation you are reserving the room, not the rate. That's never happened to me before anywhere in the US or the world as I've traveled. They stated it was because it was Presidents Day weekend and there was a storm. I had booked the rooms weeks in advance and chose this place only because of the cheap price. Needless to say I won't be staying at this Motel 6 or any others ever again. I did not get what I paid for; for the price I paid, I could have stayed somewhere else.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1490821028631, 'text': 'Dear Heather, Thank you for taking the time to share your review.

Good experience. Clean. Friendly people. At first we went to the wrong Motel 6 down the street. But I liked this one better because it was closer to the gas station.  An employee was so polite to us at the front desk I was shocked at how friendly everyone there.< /Review>

I brought my son to San Luis Obispo so he could check into Cal Poly the next morning to begin WOW there at the college. When we arrived at Motel 6 on Friday, we had to wait some time due to  several ahead of us also checking in. There was a strong cigarette smell in and around the office. The office staff were friendly and kind. When we did go to our room, it was very basic, accutally too basic for us. The room had no shampoo, only very small soaps (hardly big enough for two people), and no coffee pot. All it had was two beds and a small TV set. This might be normal for a Motel 6, but for $136 per night, I expected a little more. Also, the rooms had very thin walls and we could hear a lot of noise coming from other rooms above and near us.< /Text>

I had a wonderful stay at Motel 6 in San Luis Obispo (North); the amenities were basic but clean, and the rooms were serviced every day and kept very neat by the housekeeping staff.

What made this stay so memorable however, was Jeramie Gaines going ABOVE AND BEYOND. Whether it was me deactivating my keycard (multiple times, accidentally) and him helping me each time, to him giving us tips on where to eat locally, Jeramie made our stay incredibly pleasant. Each time we walked by the front office, he waved and said hello, and he did everything in his power to make sure that we were as comfortable as possible.

Though there are more expensive hotels in SLO, I have to say, I would probably choose to stay at Motel 6 again: the experience was incredibly pleasant, easy, and Jeramie made the entire process an absolute breeze.<//text>

The floor was gross. Hairs were in the bed when the cover was pulled back. Brown spots on the fitted sheets like they weren’t clean. Tried calling the front desk and the phone didn’t work even checked the plug.< /Text>

Staff was very friendly. I would have liked more than two pillows on bed, and more than one bath towel. Room was generally clean, but vacuum job was weak.</text>

Pretty good stay though was disappointed there wasn't a fridge or hair dryer. The sink and tub had hair in it from previous stay which was gross. But for the price I was satisfied with my main needs (comfy bed, shower, and tv).< /review>

Although the location is great and the price is, well, affordable, the front desk agents need to be trained in the customer service aspect. When I arrived to check in, the gentleman at the front desk, with a baseball cap and plaid shirt on, was having a conversation with another guest, of other things not relevant to her stay. Not until about 5 minutes later and hinting at him by looking at my watch, did he say, "where is she, we are trying to see if we have any rooms". Good thing I made a reservation.

The room was just ok. The shower definitely needed some deep cleaning...almost didn't want to shower. "Fresh" towels had long hairs in them, bed sheet was stained.

Would think twice of staying there again.<//review>

The front office staff were super nice people.  However, I didn't find the room to be very clean.  The floor was dirty.  The towels were very old and worn.  The ice machine wasn't working. The shower wasn't any bigger than a shower stall in a small RV.   It was just ok but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really needed someplace in a pinch.  We've stayed at better motels/hotels for less expensive and closer to the beach than the price of this place.</Text>

I always enjoy the value I get staying at Motel 6.  They have great locations, almost always located close to where I want / need to be.  The location was a particularly reasonable priced motel.  The room was comfortable and clean and I had a guaranteed room from an online reservation even though I arrived late.</review>

Although the staff was very nice the rooms were very small. The towels smelt really bad, the shower drain was nasty and who knows what was on the bathroom walls and doors (boogers?) The beds were not bad, I always bring my own pillow. I'd stay here again but ONLY if I couldn't find a better choice. The Motel 6 across the way is much better.< /Review>

I booked my stay same day while on a road trip. I'm glad there was room and happy to get a fairly reasonable rate for a room. The woman at the front desk was short mannered with a new employee, I felt sorry for him. Very disappointed when I walked into my initial room that reeked of cigarette smell. When called front desk to be moved, they said they would only be able to move me if I did not use anything in the room. This is ridiculous and poor customer service. What if someone is pregnant, allergic, or has asthma? Anyone should be moved in a situation like this, regardless of if they use anything in the room. Luckily for me (I guess) I did not use anything and they moved me. When at the front desk, the woman said my room was supposed to be non-smoking, but people do it anyway. Wow, thank you. I found hairs in the bed and on each towel. The towels had stains. i really wish I didn't shower there. Maybe my standards are too high? In the morning, my second room began to smell of cigarettes coming from the bathroom vent. The person at the front desk assured me they will spray in the room, a band-aid to their issue. Something is extremely wrong if your motel continuously smells like cigarettes in non-smoking rooms.< /Text>

<Text>Unfortunately this was not a good stay. Location was excellent though. For one when we arrived there was no rooms available. We arrived after check in time,  housekeeping did not change our bedding, they knocked on our door early before check out time we were sleeping n got woke up, it was very loud at night, staff was not friendly, we needed more towels for showers they were hard to get,  bathroom showerhead leaks and sprays all over, for as much as we paid it skunks of been a better stay! Will not go back.<//Text>< Pictures>

At first we were given a room that was not ready but this was quickly and efficiently resolved by the ladies in the front office. The new room was very nice and clean. There was some spilled coffee-like substance near the sink and we had to use a couple of small towels to clean it up--besides this the place was spic and span, and the beds comfy. Plenty of ice for the hot weather. SLO is just a short drive away (our destination) and there are also some grocery stores and eateries close by. Would stay here again.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>The location of the motel was good, the room and beds were very uncomfortable. The room stunk of ciggerettes as you walked in, the beds felt like sleeping on springs. The floor in the shower was cracked open and one of the towels on the rack was dirty. We were supposed to stay 2 nights and ended up checking out early due to the beds being so uncomfortable that it was hard to sleep. I will never stay at this location again.< /review>< Name>

First, all non-smoking rooms were taken, so we had to stay in a smoking room the first night.  My sister is highly allergic and had some reaction to the smell of the smoke in the room.  The hotel clerk tried to accommodate our stay and moved us into a non-smoking room for our 2nd night.  This room was extremely dirty!  The floor was so dirty that we could not walk around without shoes on.  Both of our beds had a bunch of hair on the sheets and pillow cases.  The bathroom towels has a huge hair clump on one and the other towels were covered in stains.  To top it all off, our toilet kept clogging and the front desk made us plunge our own toilet!!!  They brought us a plunger and said that they do not have maintenance!  I have never stayed anywhere and had to plunge my own toilet.  Finally, there were 2 hoodlums standing outside our hotel room smoking marijuana.  The manager was nice to refund us for 1 night, but I'm still not satisfied.  I believe that both nights should be comped.  I will never stay at a hotel 6 ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Very disappointing.<//Text></record>

<Text>This was the 2nd Motel 6 I have stayed at & the one in San Luis Obispo (north) definitely gave the other one I stayed at a run for its money! The rooms are updated, nicely decorated, with a surprisingly amazing bathroom! Definitely couldn't tell I only paid $280 for 4 nights! The location is wonderful. You are just minutes from the beach & other attractions.</Text></record>

I went here thinking ok just gonna rest my head.. wanted something inexpensive. so yes I got inexpensive and I got good reception from the girl at the front desk. My room had wood floors. I feel like it was cleaner than a Hotel I paid for up the street which was more expensive. Basic room but so happy for the price and the way I was treated. Only thing was it was a little far away from downtown so I had to Uber back after dinner and drinks but that was only $10 there and back. I will use this place again if I need a motel in San Luis Obispo<//review>

No clock or kleenex in room, so bring your own. Coffee in lobby, not room. No continental breakfast, but again the price was reasonable and a great breakfast restaurant across the street.
Also, door key did not work. I had to call the office twice. They said they would check the electronics after I checked out.
Overall cleanliness was fine for the value, and I am fussy about dirt and smells.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Place was super dirty. And then there was dirt vomit and body fluids on the wall sheets and mattress review. They switched this rooms and got upset with us saying we didn't give them enough time to clean that room and they weren't done cleaning it yet even though they had set it up like it was. Getting dirty looks from the staff because we move don't feel comfortable here would not stay here ever. Look in the picture below maybe you can figure out what that is on the floor maybe you can figure out what that is on the floor</review>

<Date>1505755666490<//Date><rating>4< /rating><Text>The updated rooms are super nice. I like how the shower was situated too because hotel shower curtains can get really gross and being behind the shower head was a great design idea. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I'm a residential house cleaner and I definitely don't envy some of the gross things I'm guessing people leave behind in hotel rooms but there are little things here and there. Target sells these awesome microfiber dusters I would recommend. Just to sweep it over the tops of things like the light fixture in the bathroom or any edges by the stand, the cubby holds for towels in the bathroom things like that. I love the new floor vs old carpet but cleaning under the bed shouldn't take that long. I get it I hate cleaning under beds but I'm sure most people check to make sure they didn't leave anything behind. And I would recommend standing in the shower and closing the curtain because my shower curtain had a blood stain on it. Lots of little minor things I'm sure a lot of people don't notice but for the ones that do it would make so much difference and maybe take an extra 15 mins tops. Other than that the place was awesome the people at the desk were super friendly. Just keep up the work because those extra touches will keep these new updated rooms looking awesome for way longer.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d<//gmap_id></record>

1) TV in the was not functional all the time. The office told us that the signal was too weak.

2) At time of booking I was told on the phone that the last night Sat to Sunday was at about $180 +13%tax. I had booked 3 nights and had decided to check out a day early. Instead of getting the promised refund I got $183 refunded.

Stayed at motel 6 in San Luis Obispo. Our room was smoke free. It was pretty clean. But I probably will not stay again. The bed spreads were not very clean. They had stains or dirt on them. Not very inviting if you ask me.<//Text>

I was really disappointed with our stay. The bedspreads were dirty; one had what appeared to be bowel skid marks. One of the towels in the bathroom had long blond hair stuck to it and it was a filthy towel. My guess is that the towels were not changed.  I had to go back to the office and ask for replacement towels. The nightstand was not wiped down, sticky residue was left behind. The room smelled of cigarette smoke as well. Will never go back to this place!< /Review>

Charged us $18 for a second person in the room. Rooms smell of lemon cleaner.. very pungent but I guess at least they are cleanish. Bed is old and squeaky (without any shenanigans happening) ;).   No carpet in the room which is nice. Rooms are small but the staff were accommodating and polite. Ok for a cheap room but next time i would pay the$50 extra for a better room.<//Text>

<Review>This location was quiet as I always hope. The bed was adequate and I slept well; a touch lumpy. Towels and soap are Motel 6 quality and in saying so I always wonder how much more I would need to pay for a higher quality. Wi-Fi is free most places and to charge is an example of being overly frugal.
Charge $5.00 to $10.00 more and provide a better quality.< /Review><Name>Randy L. Smith<//Name>< pictures>

Not realizing it was Cal Poly's Homecoming the weekend we had a difficult finding any vacancy within a 25 mile radius, unless we were willing to spend almost $500 a night. All hotels/motels raised rates double and triple their normal price. More then we would normally spend on a Motel but since options were limited, we booked and we luckily found this gem. It was clean, comfortable and had a simple yet fun renovation. I will admit, we were hesitant because of some previous Motel 6 stays at other locations but we will be back here again if we need a room in the SLO area. Great job with running and decorating this location.< /Text>

Room was clean, everything inside worked, staff was friendly, however  person at front desk made mistake, it was about 5 hours after we was in our room, two guests used they key card and was able to enter our room, (right after me and my wife just finished taking a shower,) . My wife was freaked out by it. It seems the front desk did not know it was already occupied and was given to new guests.  So my wife decided to sleep in her clothes out of fear of someone else might come inside, even though we latched and dead-bolted the door. She was paranoid. We were also afraid to leave our stuff in our room when we went out. Motel 6 should have a better system to track which room is taken already.< /review>

The rooms are Small and Dirty.
The mattresses were old and comfortable at all.
Plus we think that we was bitten by bed begs.
The room was full of dust and we saw some hairs in the sheets. The shower didn't work very well we had something very cold or very hot.
Although The receptionist was very nice he helped us with our luggages and gives us tips about the area aroud.<//Review>

We stayed for multiple nights, when we asked for a discount for one night due to how disgusting dirty the room was,( Wich we took photos when we first walked in the room) we were told no we should have said something right away. But why say something when the mext room is going to be just the same. In the bathroom where there is a hook behind fhe door for your wet towel, there was mold from there constantly being a damp towel hanging there. Besides how dirty the 3 Rooms where that we stayed in, we had a good stay and house keeping was great on our requests for towels and trash bags. But i wasnt happy when i asked for a fridge and microwave and was told because it was after 11am they couldn’t accommodate my request.</text>

Got the King room which I thought came with a King bed for my husband, infant, and myself to sleep and have plenty of room on. Instead was very disappointed to find a bed that was a few inches away from being a twin. When I called the office I was told that this was their biggest bed. I will NEVER come here again especially after paying $200.00</review>

It's crazy that they have an ash tray in a non-smoking room, with a non-smoking symbol on the bottom.</review><Name>David Bender</Name><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

This was the first time staying at this location. It worked out well as far as the location and the intention of this trip. HOWEVER, for the 2nd night, after being out most of the day, I came back to find that the front desk had put other guests right next door with two very loud, constantly barking dogs. Apparently those guests had left the dogs there while they went out. In contacting the front desk, they said they would contact the guests but had already moved them to this room due to previous complaints. Why the motel would move them beside someone else, in this case me, and continue the problem is concerning. One, as the motel wasn't very full and these guests could have at least been moved and isolated more so this problem would not bother anyone else.

As it was not known when these guests would be back, and as constant and irritating as the barking was, I chose to move to another room. I, and most people, could not stand having to deal with this for even five minutes. Not only did I have to move, which involved moving my cats and all their stuff as well, but was doing it on an injured foot which compounded the issue.

I got apologies and a free one night wifi ($3 value). Big deal.<//Review>

<Review>It was a small room but costed a lot of money. It was $120 a night for a motel which is a little crazy. But it was fine because we spent one night and we slept well.

<review>The most terrible experience I've ever had in my life at a motel. They don't even changed the sheets, I found piece of nails on it!
And also the sheets are full of little wholes made by cigarettes.
Completely disgusting!
If you have better choices, don't book at this terrible place, never EVER!
This conditions are totally disrespectful with costumers!< /review></record></dataset><record>

This place is a little better than the Motel six on the other side of the street. Though, I don't like their policies of non-smoking because they don't enforce it. People still smoke and they don't do anything about it. I didn't feel that safe in the parking lot as well.</Review>

<Text>I booked this room online with the AARP discount, when I arrived, the clerk told me they didn't accept the discount anymore. She then gave me a smoking room. When I returned and told her this, she assigned me to another room that was occupied. The third room was fine, except the toilet was running, making noise and wasting water. I don't know why she assigned me to a smoking room, or didn't know about my AARP discount. Do they even read the reservation and hold the correct room for you?

I stay at Motel 6 about 10-20 nights per year. I like the value and convenience of a national chain. This experience was below average. I don't think I'll return to this unit again.< /Text>< GmapID>

we asked for a non-smoking room and when we got to the room, it smelled like smoke. They switched our rooms right away and it didn't smell like smoke. Thanks for the quick change

Also, not sure if the room was cleaned but we found hair on our bed and the shower when we first got there<//text>

Price of room was ridiculous was quoted one price and charged another.  Hotel staff was unwilling or didn't care about problem.  Would not recommend this motel. The bed was almost to the ground and my daughter took a shower with flip flops because the shower was dirty.<//Review>

The bed was really uncomfortable and the AC unit was not working properly. It kept shutting off and you'd have to press the reset button on the plug to get it to work again. It was also very noisy in the room because of the road noise from the freeway. Considering how expensive the room was for one night, I was very disappointed.<//review>

<Text>The front desk employee told me that the discounts I was entitled to could be honored because "the manager needs to approve and he's not here right now."  Seriously? Takes the manager to apply advertised discounts?  The she added "Plus we are fully booked and we don't give discounts." What?!  You actually are full and now that triggers a "no discount" policy?  What the heck? Plus....I just hate paying that much for a room just because it is SLO town and motels stick it to all the clients unlike anywhere else.  $178 for one night with no discounts in SLO.  Seriously?</Text>< Time>

Friendly staff. Clean room. The WiFi is not free despite what Google maps claims. My room had a standing only shower instead of a normal tub. Not a problem for me but that might be important to someone. Good location right off the highway near SLO.</Text>

Was put in a smoking room.  Was charged for five nights when we only stayed for two. Front office manager was rude on the phone when straightening out the proper nights to be charged for.  Water pressure for shower and sink is way too low and it seems there is a water softener in use, which makes you feel slimy when taking a shower.</Text>

Upon arrival, I found a sticky surface on a shelf I was going to use to put my things. I called Housekeeping and they wiped it. The next morning I was out for most of the day. Came back a 7pm and saw that no one has been to clean my room. The bed was unmade, the trash was full, the dirty towels I left on the bathroom floor were still there......
I informed the front desk and received a fresh towel.....but I still think I did not received the promised services.
I had already paid for the room, I was tired and did not want to go anywhere else.....
Would like a refund.</Review>< pics>

<review>no shampoo/conditioner in room. asked front desk person where we could buy and they told me to go down the street to a gas station. No luck there and too early for anywhere else that may sell it to be open because we had to get our daughter to an early college orientation. Later we found some in the vending machine when I went to get water. No cool! Why did they not tell us we could get out of machine?!
Also stained bedcovers and broken ice machines. Hookers out front and angry guy outside door.<//review>< UserId.>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I found it disconcerting that there was no shampoo in the shower. I've stayed at other motels in your price range and they had a refrigerator, microwave and shampoo.  It seems that at the very least some shampoo to clean the hair.  Also no free WIFI.  Again, those other motels had it in the same price range.  I hate to get all lathered up about the shampoo and the other amenities, , but . I would have enjoyed my shower and my stay more in one of those others.  Also the room was a little dusty. (there was what looked like a hair ball in one place and there was a dead spider next to the wall behind the bed) And one of the shower tiles needed repair.<//review>< Rate>

<Text>You don't expect much at a Motel 6 and you don't get much.  In our case, the shower enclosure had many long strands of black hair on the walls and floor and a partially used bar of soap in the shower.  Evidently it had not been cleaned since the last guest.  There were no shampoo or conditioner amenities either.  I don't know if Motel 6 is "bring your own" or if this too was an oversight by the housekeeping staff.  While the room seemed to have been recently painted, it and the bedding had that dank odor of stale cigarettes and I couldn't wear my pajamas when I got home the next night because they smelled of that room.  Our neighbors were very noisy, talking loudly right outside our door until very late and all of them were smokers, smoking outside their rooms all around us.  I saw a used hypodermic needle in the parking lot while walking the dog in the morning. (Good news, they allow pets which is a huge plus and the primary reason we stayed there).

It's not the Ritz but it's among the cheapest options around.</Text>< response>

It seems like it would be standard to have a refrigerator and microwave in every room. We spent a lot of money to stay at your motel and had to keep buying ice to keep our drinks cold and weren't able to eat our leftovers because we had no microwave. Last time we stayed in one of your motels, I was able to use my AARP discount, which you've stopped, and signing up for My 6 on your website is useless. When we arrived, we decided to get a second room, but couldn't get a discount for being a member...the discount would have been very nice considering how much the room rates were hiked up for the holiday weekend.< /review>

Assigned a room that was not ready. Had to ask for another. The Expedia price was not honored. I had to show the Expedia confirmation to the MANAGER. Was told the AARP discount was allowed but not subtracted from total bill. Billing questions remain till Visa confirms excess refund charges.<//review>

No do not disturb sign. Made my own. Did not sell me correct amount of wifi. Couldn't get ahold of front desk over phone. Didn't have to sign anything, no idea what I was charged.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I reserved my room online ahead of time and onve i got there I was put in 3 different rooms, first room I got checked into the door was wide open when I got to my room, second room air conditioner didn't work and when I went to let the desk person know I was told there was no more downstairs rooms available unless I wanted to pay more so I had to carry my children in car seats upstairs. I was very unsatisfied with my stay and will not be back, I was inconvienced by the hotel and wasn't compensated in any way, only told I had to pay more if I wanted to stay downstairs.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I would only do about a quarter of the star if I could. I have had the worst experience ever at this Motel 6. The check in was a huge hassel and the room was pretty dirty. Almost felt like they gave me the dirtest room they had because of my check in experience. Really not happy! Never staying there again.< /Review>

Staff was helpful and friendly and there was no language barrier which was refreshing. The room had a some problems. 1) we found ants crawling up the bathroom door jamb at approx 9PM. We did not call front desk because we were ready for sleep and did not want to smell insecticide if that was the option. Cleaned as best we could and rubbed soap over the area to discourage ants. 2) electric outlet in bathroom did not work and one of the GFI red buttons was missing. Pushing the GFI did not help. 3) One of the bedspreads had an obvious stain.</Review>

It was a hassle to try and get 2 rooms together but they did it, that was great! What ruined it for us was the cockroachs that ran up the wall on the wall the bed was on, right over our heads. Totally gross. I know these places are used for low life people but when in a bind for a place to stay for the night, it's cheap and ok, this time was not ok. I guess it could of been worst, it could of been bed bugs. The room was mostly clean to the naked eye, but bugs tell me different.<//Review>

The first time entering the room and especially the bathroom there was a unpleasant odor I would suggest  lysol also the room I was in had a lot of road noise fortunately I got in there  fairly late at night.  In the morning  after returning from breakfast I found my card key would not work overall  about what I would expect for the price.< /text>

Couldn't find me, didn'the accept  my AARP card, was told they don't honor it. Was charged more than I was quoted online. And my room smelled of cigarette smoke, although it was a non smoking rooms.

I booked my room. I even called ahead of time and talked to Adrian to let him know that I would be doing a late check-in after driving four hours to him after work. He assured me that it was fine, he'd note the account, and that because I'd paid already my room would be held for 24 hours no matter what.

When I arrived at 2 AM, the new clerk said he'd given my room away. He was unapologetic and when I told him about my conversation with Adrian, he simply shrugged and said that Adrian never called him so there was nothing he could do. He gave my room away. He didn't apologize at all because he didn't care.

He did have a different room I could use, but there was ONE BED. I needed two as there was more than one person with me. It was 2 AM and we were exhausted so we uncomfortably and awkwardly shared a bed.

In the morning when I awoke, the shower was ice cold for myself and my guest. There was no hot water at all at 8:30 AM.

It was an awful stay and awful experience and I was saddened by the lack of care, remorse, and lack of treatment.

Location otherwise seemed okay, though the parking was extremely limited and crowded. I had to park all the way in the back, in a dark corner. As a female, arriving at night, this was unnerving.

There was no provided shampoos other than one tiny (smaller than a pinky) sized soap.<//Text>

Not a fair price booking from Motel 6. Priceline gave my friend a better price for a room with refrigerator. We booked the rooms on the same day. I got the same size room for a much higher price and have no refrigerator.</review>

Rooms adequate, not great. Thin walls thus noisy.  Strange neighbors! Swearing, beer drinking lying around windows open so you couldn't help but hear rude conversations.......and extremely expensive for a motel 6....$120 approx. Granted it was in SLO on a weekend, but it felt scuzzy and a ripoff.
Room itself was ok, I did not interact with staff.</text>

I had my bike stolen from the parking lot while i was there, so my impression is skewed because of it. Not the hotels fault, but it turns out the person who stole it is a local , so there are people driving through your parking lots in the middle of the night looking for targets.< /Review>

<Review>Very clean and neat room. Everything I needed. Except for no free wifi and when I called the front desk to add wi-fi I was told I would have to go down to the office to pay for it which seemed very inconvenient. Luckily we spent most of the night away from the room so it wasn't needed but free wifi just seems like it should be standard. Other than that, great room, easy to find and plenty of vending machine selection which we did use after a night out in downtown SLO.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

The young caucasion (bigger) female at the front desk (forgot the name) was not helpful whatsoever, she disregarded the booking sites I was attempting to use for a better deal.

It was disrespectful, and i was placed in such an akward situation! My boyfriend enjoyed being complimented and hit on though -_- apparantly thats what it takes to get good service here. I wasn't intending on writing this review, but since google keeps insisting on it, here i am! Management, please review your employees!

There were some sketchy looking people hanging around drinking beer in the parking lot and on the stairs by the pool who asked if we were management when we walked to our room. Totally gave of the impression that they were doing something they weren't supposed to be doing and made us feel a little uncomfortable.< /review>

The room was extremely run down. I would maybe expect this from a motel 6 but the cost was so high there was a really bad cost/value ratio. The room was humid, floors a bit dirty and internet was not free and did not work very well.</review>

<review>The location was great and right off the freway. The things I didnt like was the rooms were dirry, the shower curtain smelled like mildew, the towels were GROSS! The receptionist at the desk was intiminatiing with bright orange -red hair, a hoop ring in her nose with tattoos. I feel people who works at front desk should be presentable! I have for many years stayed in Motel 6 but this one was worst and for the price I paid was OVER PRICED(regardless of what other hotels are charging)!

I will NOT EVER stay at that LOCATION AGAIN!

Sincerely,
Disappointed customer<//review><Date>1499350627146<//Date><name>Daisy V< /name><Rate>1</Rate><gmap_id>0x80ecf0ce8f23c2cf:0x9829ede04ee2907d< /gmap_id>< Response>

<Review>The hotel was ok the first 2 nights, on my 3rd night my room was not cleaned at all. When I went to the front desk the guy up front was telling me there was nothing he can do, when I asked for a manager he said he was on vacation. The lobby was full of unhappy guests, the guy said he was going to call the police, no idea why as I never did anything. The police came and said the hotel guy wanted me gone, it was about 8 at night. Just absolutely ridiculous! Worst hotel ever! Still waiting for my refund for the last night I didnt stay there. Guy was a completely inappropriate and worst customer service ever!</Review><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

The only complaint I have recently concerns the 10% senior discount. Twice in the last month I have stayed at Motel 6 after booking on line and receiving a confirmation # with the discount. THEN, WHEN I CHECKED IN THERE WAS NO DISCOUNT UNTIL I PULLED UP A .pdf screen shot on my cell phone showing the correct price with the discount. THIS HAPPENED TWICE- SO IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING INTENTIONAL. THIS NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.<//text>

Nice check-in process, the Gals where very helpful (even tracked down a pizza delivery number for me) The NEXT Morning, I felt the hospitality level took a nosedive thanks to the RUDE lady doing the AM shift, got the feeling she hated making coffee, and those asking for it.< /Text>

This chain is priced $49.99 to $69.99 all up on down the I-5. Whoever owns this location jacks up the prices on the weekends and is not consistent in pricing. Just looking to make money on a budget chain. Do not stay at any hotel that ups the prices on weekends at one of these chains.</Text>

I was disappointed with my stay at this motel 6. During the night, there was fighting in the room next to mine. I called the hotel desk but nothing was done about it. I called again in the morning and then heard the police knocking on the door to the room next door to mine.

I asked at the desk when I checked out for a refund - at least a partial refund would have been fair. The woman I spoke with said she'd have the manager call me but I didn't hear from anyone.

I don't think the service I received was very professional.<//Review>

I stayed for 5 nights, despite requesting for housekeeping, my room was never cleaned, on the 4th night just the towels were recycled but trash wasn't taken and vacuumed/mopped or whatever totally disappointed, there was no fridge, m'wave when asked why front office staff said it was because of the promotional deal, question is why wasn't it mentioned at the time of reservation?< /Review>

Well for starters when you pull into this location you have about 3 or 4 beat up cars with crackheads sitting in the parking lot asking for money or smokes from you while you try and go to the front desk. In the rooms itself, the AC unit is all broken and up in pieces, and when the fan is one it just blows dust and dirt for about an hour straight. Table in the room is wobbly as can be since not a single leg is even and all have different wear patterns on the rubber bases. Go to the bathroom and I had white towels with black stains on them all over, then go to grab a towel from the towel rack and the rack comes apart on me. Then we move over to the toilet and the only have a half used roll of toilet paper in the whole room. Went to the bathroom once and barely had enough to wipe my nose after. Then all night one of the crackheads was walking around looking in the bed of my truck talking to herself, then would go back to her car and scream while driving around. Don't go hear, pay the money to get a place that has a lobby and locked corridors so you don't get the same disturbances. But for what I paid in the price of the hotel room, feel like this place is an absolute waste and a rip off.<//text>

The floor in the bathroom was filthy. Had blood and hair and dirt. Looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a very long time. The room smelled musty. For the price I paid to stay at a Motel 6, which was $150  I would expect it to be clean.< /Text>

I did not challenge  the attendant on his answer but did ask him to cancel the reservation for the third day because I was paying cash and didn't want my card charged by mistake and he said he would but I found out the next day he didn't cancel it and I was charged twice for the same room.< /Review>< pics>

<review>This is the first time that I have stayed in a Motel 6 in some time. I was distressed to find that neither shampoo, conditioner, or even wash cloths were provided.

And the price was not that much lower than a Marriott.

I will not be staying in Motel 6's again unless there are no other options.< /review>< pics>

We had a flat in our tow vehicle so pulled in and 1 hour later it's fixed for free. We also bought our tires from this business, in paso robles.< /review>

<text>I checked in, went to the room and immediately went back to the front desk to ask for a refund.  The room smelt like cigarettes and urine, and there was hair in the bathroom sink and shower. I  thought I could tough it out since it was only for the night, until I pulled back the bedding and saw hair on the sheets. Thats when I knew there was NO WAY I could stay there.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>The room was clean. The AC worked but not well. I did slam my knee into it while sleeping because the bed is right up against it. Also the towels were so thin and small. However, it's what I expected.<//review>< user>

I made a reservation for 2 beds, checked in late and was only given one bed which was horribly broken down.  The front desk clerk treated me like I was dirt off the freeway.  The shower was dirty with hair and grime, sheets were dirty as well.  We are regular Motel 6 customers and I will never stay at this location again.< /Text>

Check in was awful came to check in they did not have my rooms ready but assigned them to be and said to come back in a couple of hours to get keys when I came back they told me that the rooms were still not ready and that they had no one to clean them after arguing with the front desk person for almost an hour I finally got my rooms turned out they had been cleaned and ready they forgot to clear it in the computer and no one bothered to check it until late they finally got a hold of the property manager</text>

Sauber und neu ist alles. Die Lüftung vom Bad und die Klimaanlage sind sehr laut. Auch die Lage an einer Hauptstraße ist nicht die beste aber dadurch bezüglich eines Autos verkehrsgünstig. Sonst ist nicht viel in der Nähe. Check-in und out ging sehr schnell. Alles in allem für eine Durchreise völlig ok.< /review>

(Translated by Google) We had an extremely loud neighbor, we tried to contact the reception but without success.
Bed linen of very poor quality (rough) blood stain on the mattress, which gave the feeling of dirty.
Paid wifi

Roupa de cama de péssima qualidade (áspera ) mancha de sangue no colchão, que dava a sensação de sujo.

<text>(Translated by Google) To follow the hotel's environmental policy, I asked that towels and sheets NOT be changed in the 3 days I spent at the hotel, but they were changed. I think the front desk staff did not pass my request to the housekeeper. The reception staff must be well trained to pass the requests to the housekeepers and to comply with their important environmental conservation policy.
Thank you

(Original)
Para seguir la política de medio ambiente del hotel pedí que NO me cambiaran las toallas y sábanas en los 3 días que pasé en el hotel, pero SI las cambiaron. Creo el personal de recepción no pasó mi solicitud a la recamarera. El personal de recepción debe estar bien entrenado para pasar las solicitudes a las recamareras y que se cumpla con su importante política de conservación del medio ambiente.
Gracias</text></record>

The beds are comfortable and it is very tidy. It has free parking, pool and Wifi. The only bad thing is that there is nothing nearby to eat, and if you arrive very late at night you must drive at least 15 minutes to get to the nearest In n Out (burger restaurant).

The rest very impersonal. Regular situation, area far from services.

(Translated by Google) Typical Motel 6 standard room. Relatively clean, full size beds, they only give soap. No shampoo, hairdryer, fridge, microwave or free WiFi. Compensates with a low price. It is to be appreciated that they have a 24 hour reception and they checked us in past 12 o'clock at night with no problems.

Típica habitación de Motel 6 estándar. Relativamente limpia, camas tamaño full, solo dan jabón. No champú, secador, nevera, microondas o WiFi gratis. Compensa con un precio bajo.
