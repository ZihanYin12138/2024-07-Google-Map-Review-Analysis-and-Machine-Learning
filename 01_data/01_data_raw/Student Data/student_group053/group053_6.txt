Everything about this place was magical! The kids were so happy in the waiting areas and then with their personal hygienist who took such good care of each child, it was like a dream. Who knew going to the dentist could be so fun and so easy. The front desk staff is equally amazing. So thorough, kind and patient. We had an amazing time.<//Review>

My 10 year old daughter LOVES going to Lollipop. She ALWAYS has a pleasant experience.
The lovely  assistant Lucy was EXCEPTIONAL towards my daughter. 🙂
She was sweet and was having a conversation with her with ease. The office was tip top and they follow all sanitation procedures to make our visit safe. We will definitely be going back to Lollipop. I highly recommend this dentist.</Review>

<review>I don't know why? Or when? They started out sourcing their scheduling to an out side source but its horrible!!! Please go back to scheduling at the actual dentist office. The people that are answering phone do not comprehend appointments outside of regular cleaning. Its way to much back and forth calling for a speciality appointment that should be noted in the patient record and easy to book. If I get one more call call back after the 5th damn time with the wrong appointment I am dropping Lollipop</review><username>Tyler Powell</username>< Time>

Today, I took my son in to the dentist to get his teeth taken care of. The receptionist Aerial have been condescending from the time I come in to the time we leave the office.  She treat my son and with disrespect.  For the last 3 years we were with  Lollipop we have never been treated this way. They always have the best services. But, this receptionist doesn't not represent the service of  Lollipop. And she should be address. Everyone should be treat with respect. She was not professional.</review>

I can't thank this office enough from the ladies at reception to the assistants in the back !!!! The people that work here are nothing less than AMAZING !! My daughter was traumatized with her last dentist so I was determined to make her next experience 100x better and I did by choosing Lollipop pediatric Dentistry . Stephanie Cruz was such a great help and so great with my daughter and made it look effortless . Stephanie made my daughter feel safe . She was so very sweet , thorough and informative. Honestly  THE BEST ! You will not go wrong at this dentistry .< /review>

From the moment we walked in it was pure bliss. The staff is amazing. Everyone was so attentive to their patients while  engaging in good conversation to make the children comfortable. The facility is clean and everyone was following Covid protocol. A wonderful experience.</Text>

I usually take my kids to the garden grove location which is amazing, and she realized I was making the appointment for the wrong location and she was still able to book my appointments for all 3 of my kids. Our middle child has autism, and they are great at making you feel comfortable and easing any anxiety the child/parent may have. Highly recommend lollipop dental if you have kiddos. Julie at the garden grove was super sweet too with my 2 year old, even handled a little biting from her.

Love taking my kids here! My kids are toddlers and actually enjoy coming because of the environment of the dental office and the staff. They were also great at leading into other forms of sedation before general anesthesia to see what my child would be comfortable with.<//review>

The hygienist was very patient and sweet and was still able to give him a cleaning. The dentist came in and was very nice and calm and managed to examine his teeth, provide fluoride and give me information (while he was still crying....). Office staff was very welcoming and were take the utmost precautions due to the current circumstances.

Rushed and rude front desk staff! She annoyingly answered my questions about the procedure my daughter was going to be booked for! If she doesn’t like answering questions then fully explain in detail the procedure, the costs and the process! Will be looking for a second opinion or another dentist tomorrow but everyone else was amazing 👍</text>

<review>I Love Lollypop Dental (Garden grove)! Both my children go here (5 & 2 years old). My son is hesitant about others being in his personal space. The staff is always so patient with him and tries their hardest to make him feel comfortable.  We are always greeted with friendly personalities from the front desk all the way to the dentist. Thank you for making dentist visits so positive for my children!</review>< Rate>

<text>Staff is very friendly, well-organized and work well together as a team. Office and working areas are spotless and family friendly. Kids are entertained and distracted from dental work with ceiling monitors playing kid movies. Parents are encouraged to sit alongside their children while having dental work. Great follow-up with appointment reminders and appreciation notes. One of the best run businesses I've ever seen.</text><user>116018713686418551369</user>< gmap_id>

My kids first visit was nothing short of amazing! The staff was very kid friendly, reminded me of the staff at CHOC, which is really important when youngsters are starting off. I didn't notice any white coats, so that helped my kids remain calm (white coat syndrome). They have TV's in the ceiling, cool gift retrieval for kids, bright colors in the officer, tablets to keep the kids busy. I definitely recommend this office.<//text>

<Text>Very kid friendly environment. Great customer service when checking in and out. I love how they show the kids how to brush their teeth. Also make sure they are brushing correctly. I enjoy as they put your child in the chair waiting for the dentist the are able to watch a movie.(they have a different movies to chose from). Just a great experience all the way around.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Great place for children, super friendly staff! They have a “No Cavity Club” which keeps my 3 year old excited to receive each time we go. Jessica assisted us today and she was super patient and sweet with my son and he felt super comfortable with her.

Where do I begin? They have the best staff, they're amazing.  The dentist is incredible! She is very sweet and patient, kiddos love her.  We came to lollipop dentistry after having an awful experience else where which made my daughter(who's 5) very anxious.  But this office made her dental checkups a positive and fun experience.  Thank you Lollipop Dentistry this mother of 3 loves you!!!< /text>

<Text>My daughter loved this Dentist!! Everything from having her name on the board as new patient to the little waiting area in the back to the treasure box they have! I can honestly say best dentist ever! My daughter was scared of dentist in general due to previous experiences but Dr. Judy I recall made her feel comfortable and relaxed!! I haven’t had the honor to meet the rest of the dentist but I bet they’re as nice as she is. Honestly never changing dentist! My daughter is even excited for her next appointment!< /Text>< Time>

They are the best dentistry I’ve been to all the staff are AWESOME. My 2 daughter’s ages of 2 and 6 years old have been going there for over a year now. And the environment is so welcoming for children. This last time there they both did great with the whole check-up process. They love that they come home with a new baggy with a toothbrush and toothpaste filled in it & also at the end they choose a little toy and get to have a Lollipop.<//review>

Best kid friendly dentistry ever. From front desk ladies, dental assistant to Dr. Do——phenomenal experience! Although it’s a busy place, wait is minimal to nothing. Place is so modern, clean, vibrant colors, and have several stuffed animals, TVs and video games available. We’ve been seeing Dr. Do for a year now and we love it. They have an awesome no-cavity club where kids get prizes, award and picture. Kids are given coins that can be used at a gum ball machine and choose cute small toys. Highly recommended this place.< /Review>

< Review>
My three children ranging in age from 4-9, now 9-14, began visiting Lollipop when we adopted them and they for the first time received quality detail intervention. Once major problems were addressed, we went into maintenance stage where we have regular visits and preach preventative care at home religiously. Each child is now also being seen by Sweet Smiles Orthodontic for braces, as am I. The staff for both buisnesses are outstanding, friendly, playful, knowledgeable, and competent. Prices are affordable and they work with your insurance. I highly recommend Lollipop Dental and Sweet Smiles Orthodontic.<//Review>

They told me it would take 45 mins to do so and did I want to just wait or reschedule. I was there with a 2yr old and 5yr old how with working at CHILDREN'S  dentist office did they think waiting an extra 45mins would be a good idea. I was not very Happy to have wasted my time.< /review><Date>1592628628075<//Date>< user>

The office is very clean and everyone who works there is so friendly & helpful.  I've had nothing but good experiences with anyone I've dealt with while  bringing my toddler.  Having a three-year-old isn't the easiest while being at the dentist but everyone is completely patient and understanding to the childs needs and deals with them in such a caring & gentle manner.</review>

< Review>
Ive been waiting for someone to get back to me as my daughter needed an appointment for general anesthesia. She was supposed to have an appointment more than a week ago and ive been calling to try to see if a doctor was going to be present to make sure her vitals were ok to be put under. So I finally reach someone today and they never even acknowledged that they never made an appointment even though we were going crazy about this appointment ( are  you guys paying attention? To your clients?) They then tell me that I have to have a deposit of 100 dollars down to make the appointment. So I ask if you get the"deposit" back after the appointment? She says NO.. I'm confused do you know what a deposit is? Ive never heard of anything like this especially because it's a denti-cal case. Obviously if im on dentical im not really going to be able to pay 100$$ when I need assistance already. Super insensitive for this charge and really unprofessional administrators to let much of this information go unsaid when I was just in the office a couple of weeks ago. Which means all of those xrays ( that you took way too many of) are going to be for nothing because now I have to find another dentist that will pay for everything through dentical. Such a waste of my time. Im also not sure why I see perfect 5 stars on this account because I'm seeing so many 1 stars.< /Review>

<Text>Best dentist for children I've ever seen. All the ladies who work here are so lovely and patient with the young children. My 4 year old actually gets excited for her appointment! I love that they make a positive impact so the next generation won't be afraid of the dentist!!<//Text>< pics>

Rude and unhelpful front office staff. My child became sick on appointment day and cannot make it to an appointment. I called to let them know as soon as the office opened as a courtesy. They threatened to penalize me. Do they want a sick kid to be screaming and infecting others in their office? Businesses like these need to be able to absorb the cost of missed appointment without resorting to threats. Two stars because I might have just gotten a bad staff. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, but it does feel like an entrenched culture there.< /text>

I  am a student studying abroad in California, but I didn’t expect my braces got in trouble. My braces were broken, so I came here to fix them. Even though I cannot speak English fluently, all of the staff are so kind, and the treatment is really good! I really appreciate the staff here! If I have in trouble about teeth again, I’ll definitely go here again!< /Text>

<GmapID>0x80dd2f3b8cd5b289:0x35bdc1ccbb836521</GmapID><review>I personally wasn't a fan of this location, I switched my daughter to this location because of distance but after our visit I don't mind taking the extra time to drive further. I feel like at the other locations they made an effort to make my daughter feel comfortable and made her excited about being at the dentist. Where as this one felt rushed and slightly uncomfortable.  I felt like they rushed the procedure (which I get they don't want to take all day if it's not working out) but because my daughter has wiggled her legs two times they said it wasn't going to work. They didn't offer to let her dress up as a character, didn't show her a sheet of movies to pick one (just named a few which my daughter doesn't really know them by name ). And at the end they handed her a coin and that was it they couldn't even tell us where to put to coin for a prize or give a balloon or anything. I really just felt let down by the whole experience. They seemed to take pride in the fact that they don't hold kids down, as they mentioned it on more than one occasion. Like I said I will absolutely be making the longer drive next time. I'd also like to mention that they originally said I couldn't be in the room with my 1 1/2 year old because of the nitrous which I said was fine I'd sit outside after they suggested I leave my ONE year old in the iPad room while I stay in the room with my daughter! I was ready to sit outside with my daughter once they told me they were ready but they never did, they just shut the door with us inside so I'm not sure why the conflicting information about us being in the room. They didn't even offer my daughter a dang lollipop 🤣🤦< /review>< UserId.>

For the past I haven't had great experiences with them ... they failed to contact me to reschedule my appointment when the doctor wasn't going to be in the office ... put a delay in my schedule.... And today the tech hair was constantly in my face and I have very sensitive skin my advice pull hair back because that is unprofessional and unsanitary...< /review>

This place is like no other dentist office I’ve ever been to, your child is guaranteed to like it here. My child liked his experience so much, he’s ready to come back the following day. The staff is amazing, can’t say enough about how comfortable they made me and my child.</review>

<text>My just-turned-1 year old son chipped his tooth and we had just moved to the area, so I went to yelp to find a dentist and started calling to see who could take us ASAP. Lollipop office said they could that afternoon and could see my 4yr old as well, just for a cleaning which nice and convenient. They took all our contact and insurance card information over the phone.  We showed up 15 mins early to be able to fill out the rest of the forms since we were new patients.  After sitting down and waiting 10mins the receptionist informed us that whoever we spoke to on the phone (we spoke with her) scheduled the appointment for tomorrow. After re-explaining the situation they were able to fit us in, and handed us forms to complete via iPad. It was asking for all the information we had previously provided over the phone.  They got us in 45 mins after our original appointment time.  The hygienist and dentist were professional and polite.  But it definitely felt impersonal. The experience overall was fine, but it was tedious and annoying to have to give that information over the phone and then retype it into an iPad twice (once per kid) all the while the 1 with a chipped tooth is screaming.  If the receptionists could focus on the tasks at hand and stop worrying about being so sickly sweet and get to the point, that would’ve helped in this situation.< /text>< UserId.>

<review>This dentistry is amazing! Decorated very cute. Everyone who works there is so nice, friendly, gentle, and patient with my son—he’s 5 now been going there since he was 4. It’s very kid friendly. With cartoon movies playing (Lego movie today which is my son’s favorite) and toys/iPads to keep them busy while waiting. I showed up a little early and they got us started right at my appt time and last time they took us earlier than our appt time! I highly recommend this place if you’ve never been to a dentist or you’ve had a bad experience elsewhere. My son felt comfortable and he did so good! No cavities! (Again) Yay! And they take their picture and post it to their Facebook in the no cavity club, so cool! Definitely taking my son here from now on. Thank you Lollipop Dentistry for making our visits worth it!<//review>< pictures>

<review>I am disappointed with a staff who took picture of my boy's teeth. She was not compassionate because how she handle him when he's afraid and she tries to rush through. At the end she was so slow when she tries to applied medication in his teeth preventing cavities while he was so discomfort with mouth guard in his mouth.</review>< user_id>

<review>I’m filing a law suit against this office because my son was in pain and was bleeding because the spacers they put on him were broken and they said it’s ok for him to be uncomfortable. I had to take him to the hospital because he got infection from the cuts he had from the spacers. When I told the dr that my son went to the hospital, they scheduled an app for him and removed the broken spacers. They told me we have to check with the insurance about getting a new spacer and get back to you by the end of the week. It took her 2 weeks and me calling every week to tell me the insurance does not cover a new one and I have to pay $750. I don’t understand how there’s no sort type of warranty?! On top of that the dr. is rushing and explaining the urgency to put a new space maintainer because the space is getting smaller not leaving a room for the tooth to come out, therefore my son will have to do a surgery.
So basically they do whatever work to get paid by insurance companies, and then to redo the same work but this time they charge the patient.
Btw, I asked for the broken spacer to take it to a different dentist and repair it, they said they tossed it out.
Again, they don’t want to leave any proofs for their crime.< /review>< Pics>

Every single person at this place is amazing!! It's a bit out of my way, but since we found Lollipop I won't take the kids anywhere else! Totally worth the drive. Highly recommended.</review>

I must say I was amazed at how my baby interact with his dentist. I bravely said oh no I am not worried but inside I was dying because  I had to change his first dentist because there was a lot of screaming from him and a lot of frustration on her part. He said she hurt him. Today I didn't even hear a peak out of him. I asked him if he felt any pain and he said no. It's actually felt good 🤣🤣. The child have spoken. Thank you Lollipop you guys will be my forever dentist and family 🙏🏼</review>

< review>
As you walk into lollipop Dental the girls greet you with a smile and are always very attentive. They make you feel welcomed, show interest of why you're there and friendly. Crystal is sweet and when she answers the phone she shows acknowledement of everyone that comes through the door. Ayde and Cindy are very helpful as well. They keep things going smoothly and genuinely concerned about each patient. They also they do great with kids for Pediatrics. My daughter can be a handful but they deal with her so great and I appreciate that very much as a mother.  I myself am a patient for Orthodontics here. I recommend this place a hundred percent to anyone looking for a new Pediatric or orthodontic dentist. I love them. I am very satisified with them in every way.<//review>

He had his first appointment at Lollipop Dental this morning and despite being nervous before we arrived at the office his anxiety evaporated upon entering. My toddler daughter was also seen this morning. The staff is friendly and professional, and most importantly, they know how to tailor their treatment to fit the individual child’s needs. By the end I don’t think either of them wanted to leave!</review>< resp>

This place is soooooo awsome. The girls in the front desk (Destinee and Crystal) were super friendly. They welcome you with smile and have everything ready when you walk in the door. I loved that they explained every question and concern I had. My son totally loves this place and as an anxious mother I do too. They welcome you to go into the treatment area/room at any point in time, they work so well with every single child and the best part is NO CHILD IS EVER STRAPPED DOWN. Jaime was awsome too, she comforted my son as treatment was being done on him. I highly recommend this place to any parent looking for a friendly and awsome children's dentist.< /text>

I have taken a few tours in LA, and different cities around the world, and LA City Tours gave the best tour from start to finish.  I wanted to see as much of LA as I could in one day, so I went on the A1 6 hour tour with 5 scheduled stops.  The tour allows a fair amount of time at each stop, and you get to see and learn so much of LA in a relatively short period of time.  All while on a comfortable, air conditioned bus.
We saw Hollywood, Griffith Park, Downtown LA, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and so much more.  My advice is to be on time at each stop, and be considerate of the other passengers on the bus.  Also, it's customary to tip the guide for an appreciation of good service.  Thanks to LA City Tours for a fantastic experience.< /Text>

Great way to see Hollywood and Rodeo drive baby. Recommend planning your day around these tours. Hollywood walk of Fame very good (not as clean or sparkly as I imagined). Made for an interesting day. Edward Scissorhands was wandering around too. 😁< /Review>

<text>LA city tours was a great way to see and get around LA. The buses could use a refresh and a bit more leg room. But the routes were cool and the audio was good. Was lacking a live guide. But otherwise we still had a good day and learned a few things.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>We did the LA City Tour, Celebrity Homes and Beaches. We only had the one day in LA so wanted to see as many of the popular sites that we could and this tour did not disappoint. Our guide, Nick, was friendly and knowledgeable. A great tour if you only have a short time and want to see as much as possible or if you want a taster of LA so you can decide where to go back to later.</Review>< Date>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Gregg Donovan is the heart of the marketing for this business and if you’re ever lucky enough to meet him you will see why! He actually chased us down the street after we declined his offer of a tour and explained to us why his tour was better than the one we had planned. And he was right. The 2 hour tour was jam packed and the driver/host Mark is truly in the right job. He was warm, welcoming and his knowledge of LA/Hollywood was outstanding. We had such a great time and definitely recommend this tour over any else down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Really great value for the discounted money we paid!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Review>This was a great experience and great value for money. The bus picked us up from our hotel (which would otherwise easily be a 25 bucks trip to their office). We went to a bunch of places including Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Griffith Observatory, Rodeo Drive. Our guide was very knowledgeable about.. well pretty much anything Low Angeles. I highly recommend using this company.</Review>< pictures>

Took the Hollywood plus LA plus beaches plus celebrity tour. It was 6 hours long and gave us a pretty complete overview of the area which is what we were looking for, so that is my 3 stars. If they would have stuck to the sights and famous places that "make" the area - and gave us opportunity to take a photograph at each - it would have been better. In our opinion: too much time spent on celebrity homes - none of which we could actually see anyway because they grow hedges and build fences so you can't see them. Also our tour guide talked the entire 6 hours, which started out funny, got annoying, and eventually got ridiculous. Tell us history please, not your own personal thoughts!<//Text>

<review>Felt like I needed to leave a review after seeing the 3.6 star rating - it's MUCH better than that!

I can't remember the name of our driver but we took the 4.30pm tour which lasted just over two hours. Our driver was a young guy with great enthusiasm about his city which came through in the tour. We were shown Hollywood hot spots, movie filming locations, stars houses (past and present), Beverly Hills, Bel Air and more!

Would recommend to anyone looking to take a tour of Hollywood!<//review>< pics>

There were no ear phones (even though there were places for them) and the two half hour stops were too short. You have the impression that they have to do the tour in the shortest time as possible $$$, so he drove all times w speeds above the average traffic speed. The tour started at 9:40 and went to 1:00 pm, so deducting the two 1/2 h stops it just lasted 2:20 hours for $70 price per passenger. Later, we also learned that some of the information about famous actresses/ actors property residences were wrongly identified. I do not recommended it to anybody. Find another company with a relaxed driver w a company that allows him/her to drive w more time and also w good sense of humor and patience! Stressed trip overall!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Incredible experience.  You see every major attraction in LA in six hours.  The tour bus was clean and air conditioned, Caesar was a supreme and knowledgeable tour guide and LA native, and you get the opportunity to walk around and explore at all of the major stops.  There is not a more cost and time effective way to see LA in comfort.<//Review>

Threatened to sue me while walking by because we said we didn't want to go on their terrible tour. Incredibly rude guy in a red suit advertising outside should probably give you an idea what to expect on your tour. Tons of other operators nearby, so I would avoid these guys like the plague.</Review>

<review>All employees are friendly and customer oriented.
The office staff is efficient and helpful.
The lady who drove our bus was not wearing
a name tag but she did an excellent job.

We took the 6 hour tour that included Hollywood
and the beaches.  It was a great overview, the
stops allowed us to experience the flavor of
the various areas, and it was definitely better
than trying to drive ourselves around.

The bus picked us up at our hotel before the
tour and took us back to our hotel after the
tour.  The bus arrived on time to the minute.
The whole process could not have been easier.

Tip number one.  Do not depend on using the
bathroom at the tour office.  There is only
one bathroom and there is a long line.
The bathroom is unisex so there is literally
one bathroom.

Tip number two.  They have at least two buses
that are identical.  Make a note of the license
plate number of your bus.<//review>< pics>

<review>I was born in Bordeaux and not specially enjoy all Californian wines... This tour was absolutely sublime; the wineries we get to try were amazing. I do have to say that my tour man, Kim ya, made the difference: a very nice guy that knew absolutely everything he could about wines! A very nice and unexpected experience.<//review>< Date>

Overall, I enjoyed the experience.  Got to visit all of the places that I wanted to see, without having to drive myself around in this LA traffic. Diane was our guide. Was a little disappointed with the part of the trip that shows the celebrity homes. The homes are gated and hidden by trees so you cant really see anything.< /review>

Half way through tour, door to bus would not close and AC stopped working.  He called his boss who told him to press on, drive carefully and have everyone wear there seatbelt.  Nevertheless everyone on the tour got off the bus 4 blocks early and walked the rest of the way.  Waste of $100.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Had an amazing time on the 6 hour city tour with LA City Tours! The staff at the front desk was very nice and made us feel welcome.
We had about 20 minutes to walk around Hollywood Blvd. before the tour started, which was just enough time to get the flavor and take some cool photos of the stars on the sidewalk.
The tour stopped at every place that we were told was a "must see" before we came out to California! Including, The Griffith Park Observatory, Farmers Market, the big sign in Beverly Hills (amazing photo op) and Santa Monica, which was just lovely! Can't beat the fresh ocean breeze.
The bus was clean and comfortable and our driver was very knowledgable and fun.
It was a fantastic day and I totally recommend LA City Tours! 5 Stars!</text>

<Text>Decent tour of the area, mostly in the Hills. Primarily a sight-seeing tour of celebrity homes, but fun enough while you're in Hollywood.
The Driver was knowledgeable and friendly. He took pictures of guests when requested and tried to slow the truck down, when possible, to get the best pictures.
Set moderate expectations, enjoy the ride, and you'll have a great time.</Text>< Pictures>

The open bus tour was literally in a bus with its top cut out. Murder on the hair, but good for photos. Went on the “Grand City Tour”, but I don’t know that it’s an accurate name. It was random often-inaccurate information about the sites, nothing terribly interesting, then long spaces of no info, just driving - tour guide is also the driver.

The tour was simply not worth it. Instead I would have taken an Uber to Griffith Observatory, drove the Hollywood Hills with the Zillow app open, and spent my $55 on something else.< /text>

<Review>We went on a 2 hour minibus tour of star homes with this company and were pretty pleased on the whole. The driver/guide was lively and entertaining. Our minibus was a closed top one, with air conditioning (although that wasn't working very noticeably). The company also offers open top buses at other times, as well as other routes. Our tour included the obligatory stop at a vista point for the Hollywood sign, but also offering a good view over LA in general. It was quite nice to look at a variety of nice homes in the neighborhoods covered, and the tour was good for getting a sense of some of the layout of LA. There was a second stop to allow bathroom use in the middle of the tour. On the whole a fun outing.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I was a bit skeptical at first based on the office decor but once on the bus with our guide we had a great time. The bus was a closed one with air conditioning which was welcome on the hot day but meant taking photos through glass. We had a good stop at Vista Point to photograph the Hollywood sign. Our guide stopped at all the homes that we passed to give us a photo chance and tell some stories. He was really entertaining. He could have made up the names of the stars that lived in the beautiful homes we saw. We wouldn't know but it was a fun afternoon and we got to see lots of LA.<//Review>< pics>

Went on the 6hr tour which turned out to be 8 hrs due to traffic.  The tour guide was nice, but not very knowledgeable in recent celebrities and dropped us off in various locations where we didn't have much time to do anything.  Don't recommend this tour or tour company, they try to cram in too many things into one tour.<//Review>

<date>1555940659166<//date><rating>3</rating><review>I really wanted this to be a better tour. I really did. But the overall  tour was lacking any real sights, and I think that my money ($$$!) would have been better spent self-navigating LA/Bel Air/Beverly Hills ourselves. The driver was mediocre and not engaging, and the houses we did "see" were mostly obscured with fences, bushes, or the inside of the bus we were riding in.

I did get a first hand experience of the LA traffic, as our 2 hour trip was nearly 2.5.

It was hot under the sun and the bus itself was a bit haggard on the inside. Not sure why the bus is open-topped when there isn't anything to see straight up.

I wouldn't recommend this tour unless you are dying to see the overpriced house behind a gate and some bushes that Molly Ringwald used to own but now Sacha Baron Cohen now owns. Whoopee-doo.</review>< Pics>

I deducted another star as he said a pulp fiction scene was filmed at a mels diner we passed and it was a lie. shame that and puts other facts into question< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

On the tour right this minute.. not impressed at all. 2 people are talking nonstop ruining it for the rest of us, not to mention its Warm on the bus, and after paying 84.00  EACH for 3 tickets they still have a sign on the bus asking for a 20.00 tip per person.. NEVER AGAIN.. they say a 6 or 7  hour tour, but alot of it is being stuck in traffic. Better to rent a car for 40 bucks a day and Google a free map and do it all on your own...<//Review>

I came here with my family of 4 while on vacation and I'm glad we did. We took the opened bus tour going to Hollywood Hills, Beverly hills , Rodeo drive and Bellaire. Our tour guide was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable of all the star's houses. Even my teenage kids loved it. We stopped for a little bit and walked around Rodeo drive. Would definitely recommend doing this< /Text>

<Review>After googling selected this company but made a wrong choice. Only good thing was they tried to cover a lot though unsatisfactorily and they picked us at airport Marriot. Other wise the overall experience left a lot desired. The office was seedy, The guide/driver had a humorous stride but very opinionated. Not the character you want to spend the day with. Showed everything but the stops were too short and you feel somethings missing. We never really got to the Hollywood sign, the strip stop was totally inadequate. Lesson- don’t try the all in one tour, just stick to a few things.<//Review>< Pictures>

I wouldn't even give it one star if i had the option!
It was horrible..... we were booked in for the 6 hour tour, the driver was late in picking us up. We got to the office which only allowed us 10 minutes to check out 2 miles of stars. Clearly wasn't going to happen. As the tour wasnt going to return to this area.
We made it roughly 2 hours in to the tour to venice beach. At this point both my husband and I boycotted the tour and caught an uber back to our hotel. IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF OUR TIME AND MONEY!!! WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY OR TOUR TO ANYONE...<//text>

<Review>Sarcastic driver. Mentioned he has 7.5 years of experience but he’s so rude and annoying. The drop off locations for us to get pictures were bad. The driver just rambles on and on. He just can’t keep his mouth shut when needed. Would never recommend. $84 went to waste.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bf23eb116167:0x798a4e4f7259fda3<//gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Rating>1<//Rating>< date>

I live in LA and was looking for a great tour of Hollywood for my two good friends visiting from Paris and I'm so glad we went with LA City Tours!  As a local, I've been driving by the homes of so many Hollywood stars all these years and never knew it until I went on their 2-hour open-roof bus tour.
We had a fun surprise when we drove by Justin Timberlake's house and saw a "We love Hillary" sign on his neighbor's wall (JT hosted a luncheon for Hillary Clinton the same day we took the tour) ~ it was a perfect touch of Americana for the Parisians!  Thanks LA City Tours!< /text>

Don't waste your money and time. The stops were 10 minutes.  Just take a picture  and go back to the bus. Dark Tint windows on the bus  no good for photos. The next day I had to take the stairline citysightseeing  hop on-hop off and less cheaper.< /text>

<review>We did a last minute tour of Hollywood- and almost died of heat exhaustion. Paid 60$ which the guy was haggling the price with us. We ended up paying less than what we should have which was great. That was the only upside to this tour. You don't get close to any celebrity homes and you don't get even nearly close to the Hollywood sign. They make you think you  will be doing a lot of things and seeing lots of things and you end up looking at people's Gates of whom I don't even think are really the celebrities houses. Go elsewhere</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>we were driven to see the hollywood sign and told to meet back at the bus at 25min past the hour. At 25 past we headed towards the bus which was in our view and saw a couple hurrying to the bus, we in turn started to run. They got on the bus and the bus took off LEAVING US stranded. The drivers story was we were 10min late and she had a schedule to keep. I say maybe the company shouldn,t keep to such a tight schedule, maybe eliminate some sights such as celebrity homes so customers could enjoy the sightseeing  without such a big rush. After notifying the company we were picked up and taken to the next port of call to meet up with the bus. When I tried to speak to our driver about leaving us stranded she said she had a schedule to keep and to sit down. I don,t think 2min late justified her leaving us. If she looked as she was driving away she would have seen us.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Absolutely the worst customer service I've experienced on my visits to the states. Purchased tickets via the Go City card. The staff in the office were rude and unaccommodating. The driver told us to book our tour in the office and then denied that he had spoken to us a mere few seconds later. The lady at reception first stated that 'we don't do the go city bookings" when she saw our tickets she said there was no guarantee of space even if we came early. Much easier and cheaper to buy on the spot from various other tour providers. I only gave it 1 star because you can't post the review otherwise 0/5 for us!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>The bus driver Michael was very rude to us, he is not willing to listen to any special requests, instead he refuses without knowing what we wanna tell him, raises his voice & walks away. This was literally his behaviour in talking to a lady!! Throughout the tour his voice was very low esp on noisy highways, even after requesting it didn't change. He does NOT point out the specific celeb homes in many of the spots, poor description, so u don't know what house he's talking about. Waste of time & money. Even after complaining we got nothing.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

We booked a A2 -3 hr tour with this office on July-08-2016.  The staff are efficient except the owner. We got on the bus with Tom - the driver. As their advertise : Hollywood and Movie Star Homes Tour (3 hours with 2 stops) –
Adult: $59 | Child (3-11): $49
The Hollywood Sign (10 mins)
Beverly Hills Sign (20 mins)
The driver stopped first at a Rock stars hands imprinted  and second at a restroom. We had no chance to take our pictures at Beverly Hills sign and the car kept rolling when pointed out for the Hollywood sign. The Movie Stars homes were the places with gates and fences, which is easy to lie about who lives here/there. We got dropped off at different block than the pick up and find the way back to the office. We went in and talked to the "owner" about the tour and why the car did not stop at the places as advertised. She was very rude and yelled at us as "..shame on you. " As we made up the story. She said "2 stops- the driver did". " Don't tell me how to do the tour". We did not ask for restroom break and it should not count as one stop. We came here to have the picture at the Hollywood sign and the car did not stop at the vista point while the others did. We pointed out for her that is false advertisement and it is not right to rip off the tourist like that. She is a terrible person and if our kid not started to cry about the shouting, yelling, I would stay there to the end of the day to see how she handle the situation.
I think we are not the first that got cheated at this office. If anyone had the same experience , please let everyone know.<//review>

OMG! The biggest waist of time EVER! Taking a cab along Mulholland Dr would have been far more entertaining. I know for a fact that the driver constantly lied about many of the homes, as I actually live on Mulholland Dr. and know where a lot of people live.< /review>

Absolutely the worst tour I have ever been on. I went with my family expecting a 2ish hour long tour and an engaging driver. What we got was a very long tour (almost 4 hours) with an boring soft driver. The AC did not work and there were some questionable spots in the tour like long points of no commentary. In addition the whole tour sounded very rehearsed. It follows the same route like every other tour as well. The manager even said in response to a bad review on Trip Advisor that they are limited to the places they can go and that they go to the same place as other tour company's. So unless you want a boring tour that pretty much only covers houses of people like Vana white I suggest you go elsewhere.< /text>

<text>Had to be one of the worst tours I've ever been on, The driver was so boring, didn't give clear times of return, we got left in a different area, they left us, and I couldn't wait to get out of the LA area. So much traffic, boring driver, I paid but the experience was not too good.  hope you get a different tour guide, and different tour business.<//text><userid>102518686860070327429<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<pics>None< /pics><Date>1503632340932< /Date><Review>To summon me and my boyfriend's experiences of the tour, I unfortunately have to say that we were very disappointed. First of all we thought that the tour would be held in an open-roof doubledecker, alternatively in a bus with open windows. Second of all, we thought that we would get a good look at the Hollywood-sign, and of some stars' homes in Hollywood/Beverly Hills.

In reality, the tour was given in a tiny bus with closed windows, which might be good to know if any of you are planning on taking pictures. Also, it means that everytime the driver points out something outside the opposite side of the bus, you wont really see much at all. Second of all, we didn't actually get to see any homes up close. We did, however, see a bunch of gates in Hollywood Hills, which apparently lead into the actual neighborhoods of the stars. Though, we did get to see a woodenfence, which is said to be covering a realestate owned by Justin Timberlake. Also, we got to see a house belonging to Charlie Sheen. Or at least something beige, that is said to be a building, seen from hundreds of meters away. And the Hollywood-sign, well, it was so far away we could barely read the letters.

In spite of all of the negative things listed above, I would like to point out that we had a wonderful driver who really did his best to make our experience as amusing and interesting as possible. Though, I would like to save future customers from being as disappointed as we were. So, take the description of the tour given by the company with a BIG pinch of salt, before you decide to spend a big amount of money on this tour.<//Review><Rate>2</Rate>< userid>

Awesome tour! Ask for John :) he was an amazing guide! Pick up and drop off service from our hotel downtown. The tour lasted from 8:30am to 4:30pm and we got to see so many things: downtown, venice beach, santa monica, hollywood bld, hollywood sign observatory, beverly hills, bel air, rodeo drive, lunch at the farmers market. Most of the sightseeing is done from the minibus but it has polarized glass and pics were great. John never stopped talking he gave us so much information and great secrets about the stars ;) We only had one day to visit and we coul have never see so many things on our own. LA is huge and public transportation very bad.<//Text>

Visited Los Angeles, CA for a week and the wife decided to do a bridge to bridge tour.The tour was about 90minutes from pier 43 to golden gate around Alcatraz and then bay bridge.They provided a guided tour using their own ear phones.It was OK but a lot of things I really didn't want to hear about.It was a great experience!!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Were in November. It's a bit chilly when he rushes through the mountains. Talking about everything. Just not about who this house is. They only heard when they left home. And so are puzzles and jokes. If you really liked it on the plate it is written to give 20 bucks from a person to tea. The tour itself is not very cheap.

(Original)
Были в Ноябре. Холодновато, когда он прет по горам. Говорит обо всем. Только не о том, кого это дом. Слышали только уже когда уехали от дома.  А так загадки и шутки. Если очень вам понравилось на табличке написано дать по 20 баксов именно с человека на чай. Сам тур не особо дёшев.</Review>

<review>The prices are great & the watches are awesome when they don’t break. I have a couple watches from here and when they malfunction, the store associates are not accommodating to my issues.

I am very disappointed in their service here. I introduce my mom to this store due to their great prices and I would find great deals. However, lately they have been not as great as before. We've come here as our first store buying some MK braclete for $29 and when you buy 2 or more they are an additional 20٪ off. We went around the outlet and realized we forgot to buy a couple more gifts for my sisters and that they would live one. When we came back a couple of hours later they decided to change the price because of the sales. They are now charging $39 each braclete and no longer give 20% off. I inform my mom that we should just leave because that is messed up how they tried to charge more.
The following day my friend wanted to go to the outlet and buy some things for Christmas. We so happen to come back in the store so that I can show her what my mom bought. They told us that the braclete are $29 and 20% off when you buy 2 or more. I was very offended how they lied to me the day before.
Please be sure when you purchase anything from them that you have no issue because they will be sure to not help you at all. They have some type of deal with Fossil who are the manufacturer for all watches and brand you see there. That is how they can offer such deals. Be advised that they do not repair at all and when they send it out they will also send you the bill.</review>

Awesome place. I’ve bought four watches from here. People are very helpful. I broke my ceramic watch after a week and went there to repair it. They swapped it out for a new one for free. I will definitely be back. Keep up the good work.<//Text>

Came here to purchase a watch after the Christmas rush - and ended up choosing a Marc by Marc Jacobs watch that I liked at the time. Workers were friendly and helpful as they helped me compare several models of watches before I finally chose the one I wanted.

However, Watch Station adjusts the watch to your size and fit if you want to get it fitted before leaving the store. I decided to wait in line and get my watch fitted - bad choice. They took a ton of time taking out the links to get the band to fit my wrist. And the links that they returned to me were broken and no longer could be used. Clearly the worker who had adjusted the watch did not know what he was doing, so sadly the links I have no longer can be used. At the time, I hadn't bothered to check on the links - but now that I am back at home, I can clearly see the amount of force that was used to remove the links from the watch.

tl;dr - Buying a watch here is no problem, but I don't recommend getting it sized and fitted. Take it somewhere else.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) There are many cheap watches, michel kor, bubbery, ax, disel, half price cheaper than Taiwan, the service staff is also good, and it is worth buying. If you want to buy a watch, you can come here to watch ~ very suitable for people who want to buy a watch here to find the right one for themselves Watch more, compare more 㑹 and find that various types of watches here are also very affordable! I want to check it out next time

有很多便宜的錶，michel kor,  bubbery, ax, disel, 比台灣便宜半價，服務人員人也不錯，很值得購買，想買錶可以來這看~非常適合想買錶的人來這裡找尋適合自己的錶，多看多比較㑹發現這邊錶多種類 也很實惠喲！下次還想來看看</Review>< name>

Our organization needed multiple sets of logo balloons in a very short time frame, and Cheryll came through for us with exceptionally fast turn around and wonderful customer service. Through a series of emails and phone calls, she made sure everything was correct, confirmed, and shipped on time. We appreciate this company and Cheryll's expertise and look forward to using them again for future events!< /text>

Great pens with well placed design. My only suggestion when placing your order is to pay extra for the proofing. When our order was placed there was some discrepancy on the text that was to be placed on the product. It wasn't until receiving our proof that it was noticed.  Making the adjustments was a breeze & there communication was spot on.  I would highly recommend their this company.<//Text>

We had great service, turn around and over all a wonderful product that was greater than expected.  The quality of the print was way better than my last supplier.  I admire how serious they take their business and how focused they are.  I'll definitely be ordering again in the future.< /Text>

I had never ordered custom balloons before and so many different companies popped up during my google search. I think I went with Fast Balloons because of the turnaround time and I am so glad that I picked them. Their overall customer service in my experience has been phenomenal. There are no long wait times to get a human being on the phone and they work with you if you need your balloons for a specific in-hands date. Fast Balloons is now my go-to for custom printed balloons.<//Text>

This company is amazing and boy, do they live up to their name. I needed both napkins and balloons made and had them in my hands less than 24 hours after ordering. Not only that, I wanted to get more and they are going to do the same thing again. It's one of those rare vendors you find that you think "this is too good to be true" but then it all works out so you save their information so that you can them again (and again and again).<//Text>

<Text>Although we had a mishap with our first order, which they did try to correct & that didn’t go well, we decided to try them again. Their customer service is quite knowledgeable & quick to respond. Items ordered are shipped fast & their pricing is much better than any other site. The previous product albeit the error was of good quality. I’m hoping this order goes better than last.< /Text>< gmapID>

We had an order to fill very quickly and Brian did everything to not only get it done but also did not gouge us on the price. The product was EXACTLY as we had discussed and looked awesome. Brian followed up and was exceedingly patient when we changed the design and the color a few times. We love what they do and use them for small and huge orders as well for all our industry events.<//Text>

Great Experience!  I needed custom napkins quickly.  The website was easy to navigate and my rep, Lisa Garcia, was responsive and thorough.  The napkins even came a day early.  Will use fastballoons again and would recommend!< /Text>

< Review>
When a beloved family member died unexpectedly last year, we needed cocktail napkins printed quickly for a reception after the funeral.  David at Fast Balloons was easy to work with, provided a proof quickly, made the requested changes, and got the napkins to me in time for the reception.  Now a year later I am using them again for luncheon napkins for a celebration of life party in honor of the same family member.  I know I will get the napkins quickly and looking exactly the way I want them.  Their products and workmanship are very good, and the quick turnaround means no stress!</Review>

<text>We have been ordering our custom logo balloons from this company for a few years now and they've always come out excellent; as well as being shipped in a timely manner. I work for a pediatric dental practice where we reward each patient with a balloon in addition to a toy after an appointment. They are always beyond excited and very well pleased. David was extremely helpful this time around with our reorder. He made the process as easy as possible, followed-up with a phone call and confirmed my approval with an email. I could not have asked for better service.<//text>< Pictures>

Great customer service. Quality was good. They were able to work quickly and get it out to me before my  overnight deadline although FedEx held the package too long and I did not receive on time - not their fault. I Would use them again. Just trying now to get reimbursed for the shipping charge FedEx returned to them, other than FedEx everything was great.<//review>

Very easy to work with and are an awesome alternative to Cloud Busters for very large balloons. The latex is very very think, but not so much that a pro air machine has issues inflating them. All in all, it was a great experience. Here's a photo where we used the Large Super sized balloons!< /text>

I was very pleased with the quality of the artwork and balloon style I purchased for my annual high school alumni mixer. I have just placed an additional order and am very pleased with both the customer service and the delivery time.  The prices are reasonable and the product is excellent.<//review>

<review>David was very helpful from the start. Not having experience in ordering balloons, I told David I need help and suggestions and he came through. He walked me through the steps, helped me with the selection of color and design- and successfully placed the order for me. There was some confusion in the shipping part. The company was out of the ribbon I ordered, so that was shipped later and separately. Because I did not know the late shipping involved ONLY the ribbon, I panicked and thought my balloons were not going to arrive on time. I called David and he promptly researched the matter and called back. One suggestion is the company to improve communication with the customer as far as shipping delays is concerned. It will avoid the type of confusion I experienced. David was great to work with.  I will use your company again.</review><Response>None<//Response><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

We've been getting balloons for all of our dental offices that see children for the past few years and these guys are great! They're always fast, professional, and do a beautiful job for us each and every time. Best of all, the kiddos love the balloons with our logo characters, and it's a great marketing tool at the same time!<//text>

I would have given negative stars if it were possible. I spoke to a sales rep on a Tuesday and told her I needed balloons by Friday she assured me that was totally possible I sent her the artwork that day she sent me a proof the next day which I reviewed, approved and sent back.  The next morning I checked my email as I always do there was no communication with them. I checked my email again that afternoon and saw an invoice from them so I called to pay and they said oh you’re too late you missed the production time. They went on to tell me that it was my responsibility to make sure that I checked my email to find it.  I would’ve been happy to look for the email every hour or half-hour if they had even alerted me that needed to happen but they never said anything about it.  I asked why she didn’t ever call me and she said well I didn’t have your number you should’ve given me your number. They told me that this went both ways that I could’ve called and taking care of this too. When I asked to speak to a supervisor they were all magically at lunch when I called back an hour later somehow they were all gone on vacation until after the new year which is almost a month away!  I have ordered balloons many times online and I have never ever experienced something this horrible. I would not order balloons from these guys for anything nor would I suggest that anybody else does!< /review>

< Review>
Tuesday July 3, we decided to order 300 balloons with print on both sides & needed them by Friday 6th, July 4th was a holiday, with help from the sales representative (David) we placed order and had them by mid-day Friday all the way on the other side of the United States. They did not disappoint! They were for fan appreciation at a local race track, the children loved them!
They definitely have a return customer in me!!!</Review>

We ordered some custom balloons for our business event and they were a hit! Great quality with the printing since our company logo has so much detail it was perfect! We've ordered from them twice and will continue to do so!</review>

He made suggestions on the clip art, napkin color and ink color and produced it immediately ! Great great service !

Pretty authentic Korean spot. The sashimi was really fresh tasting with none of that fishy taste. Awesome sides!< /Review>

We enjoy eating out. Last night we came to this magnificent place which friends told us about. We had a beautiful evening there with first-rate cooking and a well-trained team and an impressive cook. We put this restaurant in our phone list  and we shall definitely return very soon. We highly recommend.<//Text>

< Review>
The sushi sashimi combo was great. Ordered the large and it fed 5 of us.
Came with porridge, oyster shots, korean pancakes, corn cheese, salad, tempura with shrimp, egg steam, sea urchin, sea squirt, salmon collar grilled, California roll, tempura roll, live halibut sashimi,  yellow tail, salmon, tuna, red snapper, mackerel, and etc side dishes.
To top it all off , at the end, a spicy seafood soup with your choice of cooked burnt rice soften in water or rice.
$210. Included the tip. Not to shabby....
Yummy . . .
P.s. Try the assorted (haedupbop)sashimi spicy rice bowl.
Hella good......<//Review>

Yesterday was our first time we came to that place. But It is definitely not the last time. We had great time with the efficient service, with the high quality  dishes and booze and with the decent cost. We will definitely visit there in a short time.</Text>

This spot is the one I always prefer. I visit many restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very receptive and the cuisine they place on your table is so appetizing. I never decline to have a nice meal here. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

My husband and I went there for a quick lunch, they follow any sanitary rule posible, they even wrap our chopsticks and napkins in an individual plastic bag, sanitizer on their outside tables and fresh water, i was amazed by the service, they greet us with some miso soup, tofu and edemame, the rolls were absolutely delicious, im very picky and I certainly had no expectations but oh my, I hardly recommend the rainbow roll and their volcano! Prices are the same as any other sushi place that offers Quality food and service i will definitely go back again!</Text>

<review>It seems their management changed. Food tastes a bit bland and service is much slower.   We had to wait a long time for our water to be refilled and had to ask more than once<//review><time>1579028676810< /time>< pics>

The fresh sushi here is on par with most similar style sushi restaurants scattered all over OC. Their mixed sushi rice bowl is better than most. They also have the typical sushi rolls found at most places. Same with the price. Nothing extra to draw you in week after week.</Text>

Hate to say this but I go there because my mother n mother in law likes it here but would not be my first choice for Japanese food.  But its one of very few korean Japanese restaurant around here.  As long as you stay away from sashimi or sushi its safe.  Remember that it is my opinion only.<//Review>

Great family restaurant (even for kids & the elderly), with great food (tasty & fresh/hot) and great service (friendly & quick). I especially appreciate the ahjummas, who are so friendly and considerate, despite the many customers.</Review>

<Review>Love this place and I've had a lot of sushi. My mom, who doesn't even like sushi, enjoyed this place.
We ordered the las vegas roll, a bento box with beef, and another roll (rainbow I think?).
The bento box was disappointing (I just wasn't digging the flavor), but it very generously came with a ton of side dishes, sashimi, rice, beef, and tempura veggies.
We all got some miso soup as well (it comes with the meal--yum).
The sushi was to die for. Crispy and delicious, and very fresh. I was tempted to order more, but was simply too full. The only downfall is their lack of happy hour but that really is it. If you're here for sushi, you've made the right choice.

<text>(Translated by Google) It's been a long time since it's been a long time to eat out with the giants. The sashimi was fresh and the food was clean, so I thought it would be good for the price, so I drove for 40 minutes with expectations.
After a long time, I was hoping to eat sashimi, but that evening, all of my family went in and out of the bathroom because of a stomachache. Was the sashimi less fresh?? I'm not sure why, but the initial expectations and trust in the review broke. I don't want to go again.

(Original)
오랜만에 거족과의 외식이었습니다. 회가 신선하고 음식이 정갈하다길래 가격대비 괜찮을 것 같아 40분이나 운전하여 기대를 가지고 갔습니다.
오랜만에 회를 먹을 생각으로 잔뜩 기대하고 먹고왔는데 그 날 저녁 가족 모두 배가 아파 화장실을 들락거렸습니다. 회가 덜 싱싱한것이었을까요?? 이유는 잘 모르겠지만 처음의 기대와 리뷰의 신뢰가 깨어지더군요. 다시는 가고 싶지 않습니다.<//text><userid>109485804136923787794< /userid><gmap_id>0x80dd2c2cecd15887:0x5414563e9a071725< /gmap_id>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) The food has been terrible since the owner changed, before I went twice a month, but now I won't go again.
Sashimi quality is too bad. Pajeon as a service is like eating leftovers at another table.

(Original)
주인이 바뀐 이후 음식이  너무 형편없다.그전엔 한달에 두번정도 갔었는데 이젠 다시는 안갈것이다.small combo시키면 나오던 코스요리에 예전보다 8가지 정도가 덜 나온다.
사시미 퀄리티도 너무 나쁘다. 서비스로 주는 파전은 다른 테이블에서 먹다 남은것 주는듯..</Review>

(Translated by Google) Has the owner changed here?
The number of fish in the sushi combo has been reduced
The amount has also decreased significantly.
If you don't ask for something that came out, you won't.
A little expensive fish is cheap without a combo
Only fish.
The new boss will leave the guest.
Me and all the acquaintances who know me
I will never go back to that house again.
The price is higher and the food is worse.

(Original)
이곳 주인 바뀌었나요?
스시콤보에 나오는 생선 종류가 많이 줄었고
양도 엄청 줄었고.
원래 나오던 것도 달라는 말 안하면 안줍니다.
조금 비싼생선은 아예 콤보에서 빼고 싸구려
생선만 줍니다.
새로 바뀐 사장님 이러면 손님 떨어져요.
저를 비롯한 저를 아는 모든 지인분들은
다시는 그집 안갑니다.
가격은 더 받고 음식은 더 형편없고..</review>

<text>Danielle Licht was a thorough professional in conducting the eye exam. I appreciate that she is freshly out of school (and a U of Michigan graduate as I, my wife and son are) with the latest knowledge. She gave the best advice for dry eye and I had excellent glasses made. The support staff was caring and very knowledgeable including the optical AND insurance departments. Highly recommend this group!< /text>< Response>

<Review>Great experience. The doctor really breaks down what best for your situation. Then the young women working the glasses made me feel comfortable about different styles and I needed getting two pairs because they were such awesome choices they present. They follow strict COVID-19 protocols and make sure everyone is comfortable and safe. 6 stars If I could.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I have been going to Primary Eyecare Optometric for several years now and I have found it to be an exceptional office. From the friendly receptionists, who great you on the way in, to the technicians, who perform all sorts of eye tests quickly and thoroughly, to Dr. Dea, who expertly evaluates my eyesight and prescribes the perfect prescription for my needs, they all do so while also answering all my questions and even carrying on meaningful conversations! I'm especially grateful to Dr. Dea, who explains my scans in layman's terms each year; and in so doing, he also teaches me about my own eyesight and its progression. This time there were also additional sterile cleanings on each piece of equipment. It's always been spotless there, but now they have instituted even more systems to ensure there was a virus-free environment. I'm so impressed that I've recommended them to 3 friends and they are all going there, too. As you can tell, I'm a very satisfied patient.<//Review>

< review>
I would not recommend this place. I had made an appointment and had waited several weeks only to have my appointment canceled just hours before I was scheduled to arrive. No explanation was given and I was only told someone would call to reschedule the appointment on the following Monday.
Monday came and went and there was no followup. I called and was greeted with an automated message that the office had been exposed to COVID-19 (Corona Virus.) This was never explained when my appointment was canceled nor was it communicated to me at a later point. DID PRIMARY EYECARE EVEN WARN THE CLIENTS THAT WERE EXPOSED? I can't be sure but their unprofessionalism would cause me concern.
Several days later and I still haven't been contacted about rescheduling.  Once again It was up to me to call the office and get a status update. The receptionist lied and said they were open Monday (even though they were letting an automated message do their dirt work that same Monday) And I had to pry what happened out of her. She said she would set up a new appointment for me... IN THREE WEEKS.
I understand there is a global pandemic and everyone is running a little short staffed or under duress. But it doesn't make sense that I should have to go nearly a month and a half without an appointment because of their mismanagement. Unless that particular optometrist is on available for two week because they have COVID (but I stress they didn't communicate this as an excuse) leaving me to only assume they just don't have the ability to accommodate me in a timely manner.</review>

I always have a great experience here— I have been a patient of Dr. Dea’s for many years. He is terrific. I had an exceptionally great experience recently when replacing my sunglasses. Kaye helped me, put a rush on the order, and I got my glasses in an amazingly short time, just in time for vacation! I am delighted!< /Review>

Friendly staff, eye examine tells a lot about your health, the technology eye screening equipment was top notch, and my sales associate seen that I was a fan of Coach, and of course she picked me out a cute pair of Coach glasses, so glad my eye insurance was available.  Can't wait to see my new glasses.</text>

I have been a customer for nearly 20 years. I went to a new eye care facility this year because I moved to Concord... horrible idea!! I will never do that again. I love the crew and Dr's and excellent service my daughter and I have always received over the years. I will remain a loyal customer<//Review>

I actually LOVE my doctor here.  Great with me and my kiddo.  The eye doctor has always cause me a lot of anxiety, but I feel totally comfortable here.  However,  the front office staff needs some help.  I've never had a positive interaction with them.  I've been waiting for a month for my contacts, but apparently my mailbox was full.  So, they knew that I didn't get the message and never bothered to call back.  When they called to confirm my last appointment, my son was in the middle of a tantrum, so I asked them to call back.  Instead, they automatically cancelled my appointment, but didn't tell me.  So I showed up and was told I couldn't be seen that day.  Thankfully I pressed and they fit me in.  The only reason I stay here is because this is the first eye doctor where I haven't had extreme anxiety in the appointment.  Just wish the front office staff wasn't so rude and unhelpful.< /Review>

Very bad customer service!!! Michelle has terrible attitude problem especially if u look Mexican. Yells at you for doing nothing wrong. Typical white supermist! Keep asking me if I can pay out of pocket if my insurance doesn’t cover... even after telling her I will pay out of pocket! I had done my eye exams here last week. Definitely move to a different optometrist next time!!!< /text>

< Review>
I have been fortunate enough to have Dr. Osias as my Optometrist for a number of years.  Dr. Osias is like an old friend, and he treats me as such, he knows about my preexisting conditions and always keeps a watchful eye on my eye's and eye wear.
Normally, I see Dr. Osias for my annual eye exam, however this year I ran into a bit of trouble with my Primary Physicians request that I get an eye screening at Kaiser.  Kaiser "found" a problem with my eyes with the pictures they took. Not only did this put a good scare into me it also added a lot of stress to my world.
Dr. Osias was happy to recheck my eyes, and run a new Optomap series of images on my eyes even though I had a series of pics done in February at my annual check up.  Dr. Osias worked with me to figure out what Kaiser had likely seen. It turned out Dr. Osias had already seen the issue and was watching it. He collected data and drafted a note for the people at Kaiser, explaining his findings and the promise that IF my eye's developed a problem he would without hesitation direct me to the right people to get any corrective action taken.
I have loyalty to Dr. Osias, that only comes with years of working together, trust and mutual respect.
Primary Eyecare has been there for me when i was a cash paying customer as well as when I had insurance.  They have always tried to work with me to save money, and they are flexible in working around my schedule.
I would and will recommend Dr. Osias without any hesitation.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I saw a doctor in this office. Following the exam, I went to order the glasses I had already chosen while waiting for the exam, and was told that I needed a separate appointment to buy glasses. I drove down the road to Visual Insight, ordered glasses, and they have been my family's eye care provider since then.

It's now been a year. This office has apparently taken it upon themselves to schedule another appointment. I first received a phone call asking to change this appointment, which I never made, and I told them to cancel it. I then received a text confirming this appointment, which I never made, and I called and told them to cancel it. I have now received an email reminding me about the appointment, which I never made, with the warning, "Please note that we do not accept changes or cancellations via email." I regret having given them my contact information.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Dr. Dea is wonderful! I've been a patient in his practice for almost 20 years. Dr. Dea is knowledgeable & always friendly and explains every process of the eye exam. I just love him! I do have to say some of his office staff is rude,  the front desk staff is good but the assistants really need to improve on their customer service. The last couple of years they tell you to come at a certain time to pick up glasses and then always cancel last minute saying they're not ready...kind of frustrating. Otherwise I am very pleased with Primary Optometrics. I also love the new location in Castro Valley. Kudos to Dr. Dea.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I've been going there for over 25 years when they had the old office in San Lorenzo. They had excellent customer service and great staff. My father is the one who introduced me to Primary Eyecare. Since then I have referred family members, friends, and co-workers due to great customer service and there professionalism. However, for the past 3-5 years it has gone downhill. All of the friendly and courteous staff is gone. I walk in for an adjustment and they say everything has to be done my appointment. I can understand if they are busy, but sometimes it'll be only myself sitting in the loby. I always paid cash and did not use my insurance because when you pay with cash they give you a two year warranty on your lenses and frames. I have used their services more then once in two years. All of a sudden, if you pay cash you only get one time exchange. Also, if you pay cash you only one exchange in two years. I asked to speak to the supervisor and she tells me this has always been their policy. I told that you have did this before where you exchange it for me past practice, and she said no. I told her to look at my file so she could see it. I asked to speak to the owner.  I was told she would replay the message and get back to me in a week, which he never did. I usually spend between $500-800 on a single pair of glasses every year at their office for my 3 kids and I, so I expect when there is a deep scratch or a problem with the frame they'll honor their product and their warrant. Unfortunately, this has changed. My dollar is good anywhere. Thereofore, I will not be purachsing glasses here for neither myself or family and will be informing my friends and coworkers about this policy change.< /review>< Pics>

I checked out this place while I was browsing on Ritual for my dinner take-out food. Actually I think I've seen lines in front of this place so I decided to order ahead of time. I ordered Mini Omakase and it took less than 10 minutes for it to get ready for pickup. They have that really lovely wrapping. Everything is just so neat and detailed. Sashimi is just fine. But I would recommend it to those who would like some fast but well prepared food to go. They close early by the way.</Review>

<Text>Very thoughtful packaging. Fish is fresh and price is fair for what you get. I ordered my line so I am suppose to skip the line for pick up. But since there is just one line people in the queue gave me dirty looks for not following the line. It would be better if they have a separate sign for pick up to avoid confusion.<//Text></record>

<Gmap_id>0x80858061a4b3130f:0xb5c031c0a1f4dea8<//Gmap_id><Text>Wow - probably one of the best sushi I have ever had in San Francisco...  The fish was very fresh!  I got “mini Omakase” (chef’s choice, small) for $15.  The small box (3.5 in x 3.5 in x 2 in) does not look like a lot, but it comes with a small package of sushi rice, miso soup, and a package of aji-nori (Japanese flavored seaweed), wrapped in a small wrapping cloth.  For me that was more than enough food, but if you have a big appetite, the regular omakase is $39.  I will definitely go back there.< /Text>< rate>

Oh my God Becky, look at her lunch... I love Japanese bento and had to visit The Grubbies after spotting it on Yelp. It's a little take out window with Japanese signage and a big drum next to it. The line was pretty long during lunch but after I spotted the uni and ikura lunch set I decided to commit to the process. It took about 15 minutes for us to get up the window but the ordering process was fast. I ordered my lunch set, paid and got to make a wish and hit the giant drum. Oh yes! This is what I call true entertainment! My lunch came wrapped in a beautiful blue scarf and I carried it back to the office to unwrap like a wonderful Christmas present. My uni and ikura lunch came with rice, miso soup and nori. Each bite was everything I wanted in the perfect Japanese comfort food lunch and for me it was well worth the hefty $35 price tag. They have cheaper lunch sets and I definitely recommend ordering ahead to avoid the lunchtime wait!< /review>

<review>More than just a beautiful package for lunch! I got the Chef's Special which was well worth the $39. Wrapped in a gorgeous cloth,  the special included an assortment of salmon, otoro, uni, scallops, tuna, salon roe, and other fish on a bed of cabbage and packed with sushi grade seasoned rice, miso soup, dried seaweed, soy sauce (in a cute fish container), and of course wasabi and ginger. I got lucky on my first try going there because they were sold out after me! Definitely worth going back for seconds and more!</review>< username>

<review>Ridiculous price for Japanese supermarket style take out sushi. Even seaweed is cheap. "Toro" was a mushed unrecognizable white fish. Interesting business concept and cute packaging but 5x times price  for a average supermarket sushi.< /review>< Pics>

Also, now they have a little table at front which you can stand there to enjoy the chirashi which remind me the "stand up meal" culture when I was in Japan.  Highly recommended this place if anyone looking for a place that serve authentic japanese ses chrashi.<//Review>< pics>

Good food, but really expensive for what you get. Would have been good value if it was a restaurant you could sit at, but not $39 for a takeaway box!</Review>

good sushi but a little over priced. Come early or they sell out. All the bowls are pre-made, sadly, but if you're craving decent sushi at lunch, this is the place to go< /Review>

Some might say it's a little pricy, but for the quality of the sashimi they are selling, it's well worth the price!< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Seafood bowl in this place ︎

Arrived late at night so I haven't eaten it, but it's a valuable Japanese food in San Francisco

The price is reasonable, and the seafood bowl ︎

Came here to get a slow feeder for my cat. Bought a small dog one that works well. Was a little put off by the store owners telling me my cat would be destructive if I tried to make her use the slow freeder (because their cat in the store chewed through food bags when it didn't get what it wanted). Ultimately the feeder works really well for my cat - no more morning vomitin and she still eats the same about of food, just slower. All in all, though, would buy from here again. They have a great selection of stuff!</review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>This place is THE dog food and treats provider in the wide vicinity. If it's out of the way... Stock up when you go. It's worth it. PLUS they stick by their words in that if your pet does not agree with the flavor or quality of the product then the return is honored. Can't say that for many places. I drive out of my way to take my Doghter here (Instagram: TiffanyTheChiweenie) and we both agree that this place is the real deal.</Text></record>

<review>I drive from Beaumont to Paws because they carry Primal frozen chicken nuggets.

Rare to find a store that carries this healthy food.

Service is quick and friendly plus after you buy a certain amount, you get a bonus!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Text>When Bracken's Bird farm went out of business,  they left a great void for bird lovers. Paws did not fill the void, but they offer a lot more in the way of primarily food. They also offer millet spray, but not sure about cuttlebones. The employees are very nice, and knowledgeable.  Paws is right across the street from Toyota of Redlands.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Love this place. They have a great selection of premium wet and dry cat foods. The store cats (Lenny, Laverne, and Alice) always greet us with a purr. Employees are polite and ask if you need help without being overbearing and needlessly trying to upsell things. Much prefer it to a bigger retailer. Came in a few weeks ago, asked if they carried a new product I had seen from a favorite brand, and the lady at the counter (giddily! excitedly!) pointed me in the right direction. Will be coming back 👍<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>We just had our dog allergy tested and brought the results into paws. They were fantastic in helping us find a food that worked with our dogs allergies! After shopping at petco and petsmart with no luck. The prices were great, and they had a loyalty program that allows us to get the 13th bag free!<//Review>< Pics>

This is my go to place to purchase food/treats for my pets. The people are always friendly and we always have to say hello to Laverne, which is one of the shop cats. She seems to always be right there perched on her favorite cat tree, near the entrance. My dog gets so excited when I bring her here. I would definitely recommend checking this place out for all of your fur babies.< /Text>

<Text>This shop has consistently gone above and beyond for me (and my dogs) for a few years now. They have a large selection of supplies in stock with staff that provides real customer service. They took my dogs allergy test results and we're able to direct me to the food to help improve his symptoms. Simply stated, they have earned my loyalty and trust by providing value which you cannot put a price on.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>I go here for all my cat supplies. The owners are incredibly knowledgeable about cats (at least, I would also assume they know about dogs). And they know me. I go in and they bring up my account and keep track of all my frequent buyer credits, too. Definitely recommend this place.< /Text><user_name>Rapple A</user_name>< user>

This place is really nice! They have all sorts of dog and cat food. Healthy and high end brands too which is good. Lots of toys, bowls, and treats. FYI, if you're allergic there are multiple cats lurking around the store too!! I own cats so it makes me happy to see them when I go :)<//Review>

Really good selection of all things dog. In my case family. Prices on dog treats are a little high but strictly on dog food there right on.</text>

I am a regular customer at Paws.  My holistic Vet recommended them for raw food for my special needs dog (which worked, by the way).  The selection of food, toys, treats, and pet paraphernalia is extensive.  The employees are knowledgeable and friendly.  I have to drive a bit of a distance to get to them, but it is worth it.  Say hello to the "guard" kitties when you go.  Can't recommend them enough!< /text>

I've been here a few times to get some specialty dog food and the staff seem really friendly and helpful.  There is a large variety of options of dog, cat and other pet supplies.  My issue came as there is not a large supply of dog food as there would be maybe one or two bags of a certain food at a time.  Another issue that came about is there have been times that the store was closed although hours stated they would be open.  Overall, it's cool that there is a locally owned pet shop like this in the area.</Text>

Staff is always helpful and friendly. They special order food for me amd call me as soon as it comes in. Prices are about the same as Petco/Petsmart, sometimes cheaper, but they are a locally owned small business and we prefer the welcoming feeling from them over big corporate stores</Review>

They're great! When I suspected one of my small dogs has food allergies, my mom recommended Paws... I walked in and was greeted by friendly knowledgeable people that listened, gave me options in different price ranges, and explained everything. No hard sell on the expensive stuff, just information! I left with a shampoo that's amazing (Micro-Tek) to help relieve coast and skin irritation and a dog food with very minimal ingredients to try. Gave it a week, but my lil one was still allergic, went back exchanged for a full bag of the "next in line" food combo, gave it a week, went back and had to exchange again (poor puppy!). They encouraged me and let me know she'd get better. Welp 3rd times a charm! Prices are great, I pay about 10 bucks more for a large bag, but this is way better quality, my nuggets eat less, have incredible energy, and allergies are gone! To sum it up, if you want the very best for your 4 legged family member, go to Paws!<//Text>

< Review>
I Love Midas because of the friendly professional people who work there, and because of how far my money goes. The employees at Midas are awesome, especially Brett Grabill. They are always fair with me and conduct their business with professionalism. I have regularly visited this establishment over the past 2 years and have been pleased with what I've seen.  Midas has never tried to sell anything to me that i did not need.

Thank you Brett and Midas for taking care of all my automotive needs, I will be a life long customer.<//Review>

I came here to get a tune up and a diagnostic for my power steering. I was told it would be $60 but it couldn't be done until the next morning. I came back the next morning and the priced jumped to $120 just for the diagnostic and that didn't include the price of repairs. Then I was qouted $1000 because all of sudden the O2 sensors need to be fixed. I told him I would rather sell the car than pay that price. I was thentold to just get the tune up and was told $250 for the price of that(ridiculously overpriced). When I cam to pick it up it was all of a sudden 350 and he said that I must not have heard him because of the mask, which by the way no one wore properly at the shop. He said he would work it out and it came back down to 258. And by the way they never checked my power steering. I will never come back to this crooked shop and will warn everyone in the neighborhood to stay away as well.< /text>

<text>I was quoted a price for two tires over the phone, final payment was confirmed but when I got there the price almost doubled. I would have bought the tires but when I questioned the increase the guy who I assumed was the manager pulls the print out document I was looking at away from me and said in a very rude and unprofessional manner "that's ok you don't  have to buy them" That's a bad impact on me as a first time customer and will never use this business again.
Whether the guy is the boss or owner respect goes a long way. Totally disrespectful, I bet he lost alot of customers this way. He should be more tolerable with customer when you quote them a price and then you see something different when you arrive. Stupid and the public don't mix.<//text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><text>I had a great experience @ Midas in Inglewood. Brett's customer service and honesty was great.  I took my car in to see how much it would be to fix my air conditioning.  Brett was so honest.  He told me that my car (2016) required a new type of refrigerant and that it would cost to have it fixed.  He also informed me of a hole that caused the refrigerant to leak.  I was unable to pay that price at that time and he actually recommended another establishment that he knew would be more affordable.  He was so kind and did not take advantage of my lack/ignorance of car knowledge. As a woman I greatly appreciated his help and honesty.  I will definitely be back.< /text>< pictures>

I highly recommend this store. After having a few poor experiences with other Midas locations, I was fortunate enough to get connected with Brett at Midas Inglewood. From start to finish Brett went above and beyond to make sure I got the service I needed. I would recommend this store to anyone and plan to come back for any services I need in the future.</Text>

<Review>They will fix your car right and charge a premium price to do it. A simple radiator replacement cost $664. I found a coupon online for students and showed them my acceptance letter to law school with my student ID number and the manager tried to call it an advertisement. I said, "Read it!" He then says well so you are not actually a student yet. Then why do I have a student ID number! The coupon say bring a student ID, not be sitting in a classroom. Student is an enrollment status. By his logic online students and correspondence students must not be students either.< /Review></record>

I have been going to Midas in Inglewood for the last 4 years and Brett and the crew never disappoint. They are always honest, professional and reasonably priced. Not to mention they are within walking distance from my neighborhood which makes their location convenient. I have always sworn by going to the dealer for routine & major services. But after my first visit i have changed my tune and my only choice is Inglewood Midas for total car care on all of my family's vehicles. I even secured the Midas credit card which was a lifesaver on some major work needed for one of my vehicles. I was instantly approved and it gave me the peace of mind i needed. I am very thankful for their services and superb associates.< /Text>

True Story: I went to this particular Inglewood Midas and was told I needed new tires and new control arms in my Audi Q5. Estimated total after taxes: $1,295.00! Ladies who know about intuition believe me when I say something didn’t feel right. I told my husband let us get a second opinion. My husband said they are the experts but okay let’s get a second opinion. We live in Antelope Valley and decided to get an Opinion at Midas in Santa Clarita on Sierra Hwy.
Would you believe the service we actually needed was $50.00 !!! All we needed was our control arms tightened and no new tires until next year... smh. I am making as many people aware as I can. This was a total injustice and pure rudeness. The owner of Midas Inglewood is the one who gave me the estimate. Highway Robbery !</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Midas rents out their parking lot for the Forum. I went to a U2 concert on May 15 . They rent their parking spot for $20. The sales man for the parking lot said fast check out and leave. I was in the parking lot waiting 30 minutes after the concert since they pack them in.  The last pack car in front of about 50 cars did not come until late.  So don't trust to park your car here. The guy will lie and say fast check out to leave but it is not true.< /Text>

I've been here before and have had pretty good customer service especially from their manager John. However today despite the kindness of  Jonathan who was working at the front desk, I had horrible service from Charles. I'm not sure if Charles is the owner or just a worker but he felt very rude to me. I was a little tight on money so my dad had offered to pay for the cost over the phone. Jonathan said that was fine but had trouble figuring out how to work the system. Charles came over and the first thing he says, in a gruff voice, "Well we aren't supposed to do this!" I was a little stunned. I mean if that is your policy that is fine but at least be kind about it  I personally think if you are getting money it shouldn't matter how, especially if you are talking to the person who is going you their card info. I ended up paying it with my card anyway and instead of saying thank you or anything nice he sort of just walked away. Jonathan apologized and said at his store in Hollywood he would have been able to do it without any problem. If I had known that I would have gone there. Next time I won't go back to the one in Inglewood especially if Charles is working there.</Review>

I ordered the grilled chicken Sandwich combo with ranch. So they put the ranch on the sandwich and when I ask for veterans discount there apparently is not one. NOT VETERAN FRIENDLY. It is student friendly apparently though. So when my food comes up I ask for ranch. No that's .50 cents more but they gave me 20 packets of ketchup. I don't recommend this place at all.</text>

Burgers, asada fries, tacos, dessert, so much to choose from and large portions. Outdoor dining only as of February 2021. Ordering available inside and also outside order window facing main st. Entrance on Willis st. Parking on Willis st. Near Coca Cola mural. Great spot for a quick bite.<//review>

There was some tables outside if you really wanted to eat your food in the open air, but they only seat 2 people so don't take the whole family😅
The food was good and freshly made, NOT just sitting in a food warmer waiting to be put out like other burger joints. This place is better then fast food but has similar prices.
🤠I HIGHLY recommend the Asad burrito and texan burger, and funnel fries. Seriously it was so delicious, this is definitely going to be a normal spot for us.
This DOCS is NOT ON MAIN STREET, where all the other restaurants are and its just a little bit hidden so keep you eyes peeled for it when driving or Google maps it, but 10/10 would recommend..<//review>

This place used to be my #1 go to spot for a burger, ever since it left the corner location it all went downhill. I spent 13 min trying to get attended at the window. The drinks are a lot smaller now too, and now they charger for ranch. Idk what happened but the burgers don't taste the same either. This is so sad to see such a good place go bad, its sad to say that now rainbows is a way better deal than this, I miss the old docs it's not the same anymore I'm so sorry< /text>

So excited to find out that Doc’s had re-opened. We missed you guys. But every time we order from one of the delivery services our order is messed up. We will not be going back until this pandemic is over & we can sit down inside & eat. Uber Eats & GrubHub have ruined Doc’s for us now</Review>

Zachery was very thorough and paid attention to detail. He took time to get all the spider webs in my porch railings even after brushing them, I saw him stick his hand in and pull out a web! Other people would just leave the web there, but Zachery went the extra effort to get them all!</review>

We had Bryce Overland service our home today. Super friendly, efficient, and thorough. I don't always review, but Moxie Pest Control never fails us and has taken care of our home for almost two years. They choose employees that always reflect their great company and services. Thanks Bryce and Moxie!<//Text>

I’ve worked with several pest companies over the past few years and this one is hands down the best! I use it for my hospitality business and it’s a lifesaver! They are very good at what they do and I love that they take detailed notes to my somewhat complex setup at my property with multiple gates and fences and a guesthouse. Since I’ve used them I have not received one complaint from guests about bugs. I’m very impressed with their kind customer service experience as well. They make me feel like my business matters to them. The value is also good! I highly recommend Moxie!<//text>

They are a great company, keep you informed of up-coming visits, and the approx. time when the technician will be arriving at your home via text. They do really well at keeping your property free of little critters, any any issues after their visit you call and they come right away.< /Review>

Thank you for the opportunity, to express my experience with the service done with us today.
I was here all they and would appreciate if the Moxie employee would have ringed and asked us which area's need to be covered, which unfortunately didn't happen and I would like to request him to come back to cover few area's that need to be covered badly.

I just arrived home as he finished, so only spoke to him for a few seconds. He appeared to be similar to all the other Moxie people who have serviced my property, friendly, knowledgeable, and someone I would talk to and spend time with if i had been around. I’m happy with Moxie’s service. My yard is free of the spiders and other pests that normally accumulate, So far, I am very happy with Moxie service.< /review>

<Review>Moxie promised to reduce the amount of spiders we have coming into our home and on the outside of our home. I had them come out and showed them what to do and where to spray, they did less than half of what I asked.  I called the next month and asked that they come and re-service as we still had over 15 spiders coming into the house within 2 weeks of them spraying the first time. I continued to call Moxie monthly as the spider situation was not improving. They would tell me my gate was closed and leave, my gate is ALWAYS closed, but ALWAYS unlocked. They did come back one time, I showed the service person again what I was wanting and he basically told me he would try but no promises with the product he was using.  I'm not sure what that was about.  I had Moxie come out 1 more time for a total of 4 times now, still, spiders literally coming into the house alive the day after they sprayed and this was the 4th service in 5 months. I told Moxie I was moving and that I would need to notify them of when I move so they could service my next house (only b/c we were in an agreement), the gal on the phone assured me that she would make notes of it and also make sure that a LEAD technician would come out as I had been told a lead was coming out each time and they never did.  I get an automated phone call today telling me they are coming to service my house that I'm moving out of.  No-one at Moxie reads notices on accounts, they don't pay attention to their customers, they are a large company and all you get is a run around and a product that doesn't work and them setting up service convenient for them, not service that works for their customers.  Moxie is claiming I have to stay in my 12 month contract with them.  Even with their lack of performance, lack of attention to notes on my account and lack of competence in scheduling for a home about to be vacated.  I've used 2 other pest control companies, and 1 reason I switched was b/c my favorite company doesn't use automated billing and its less convenient, but their performance was stellar.  Moxie is a big company that lacks care and concern for customers.  I would not recommend them.< /Review><rating>1< /rating>< pics>

We've only just had our initial service, but it was more thorough than any other company I've used in the past.  Jorge spent about an hour at the house.  He completely swept the entire outside of the house and all patio furniture and bushes for spider webs before spraying.  He also got rid of a very active wasp nest.  I am so pleased with the level of service.  Also love that their product is kid, pet, and plant friendly because we have two dogs who get into EVERYTHING.<//review>

They scammed me. Impossible to close account. Charged over $800 and still have pests. Moxie will not answer the phone to close the account. They have been charging me for years. Moxie will not close my account. Do not go into business with Moxie. Emilio from Moxie leaves text messages to call him but he never responds to my phone call to cancel.</Text>

We saw a mouse in our kitchen and called Moxie on the second day. They were able to schedule a rodent service on the day after, which is  the Friday before 7/4. I am really appreciate the timely response. The technician, Boston, showed up today on time with mask, shoe cover, and gloves. A very kind and professional guy. Enjoyed talking with him as he set up traps around the house. So far, I am satisfied with everything they did. Seriously considering to become their long term customer.<//review>

Love Moxie service; not thrilled with appointment scheduling. Technician arrived during the first appreciable rain in 9 months. yet still claims to have provided services (wouldn't really work during an inch of rain, would it?). Moxie's contract allows unlimited follow-up appointments, which we will schedule during a > 1 week rain respite... but they apparently just wanted the billing for business reasons., not for efficacy reasons.</Text>

<Date>1600478590404< /Date><rating>2<//rating><Review>When discussing services for the first time on the phone, the representative (Riley) had discussed a monthly rate ($55/month) and plan. It was not after we had signed the contract and the agent arrived for the initial service (decent job) that it was disclosed that he would be coming out once every 3 MONTHS, not every month. We feel that we signed a contract under false pretenses of receiving monthly services.

Furthermore, another agent to whom we discussed our concern reviewed the voice recording and confirmed our complaint that the actual terms of a 3-month service schedule was not disclosed to us before being furnished a contract.

We feel that we verbally contracted with Riley about monthly service and that the company is reneging on their own times about verbally clarifying to us their treatment schedule prior to having us sign the contract. We would either like the contract to be voided without charge, or receive monthly services at $55 / visit.</Review>< Pics>

My technician did a thorough job and offered amazing customer service. He was fast and friendly, and also asked us if we had any specific concerns we’d like him to look at. He wore a mask and gloves during inspection, and also wore booties when indoors. It is completely safe - pet/plant/family friendly! If you’re ever looking for a great pest control service and you’re in OC, I highly recommend Moxie Pest Control!<//Review>

Terry has been out to my home twice and has quickly gained our trust. He is knowledgeable, friendly, professional, and efficient. I called the company out for a reoccurring ant problem in between regular services and Terry was great about going to extra mile, even on a Saturday. We would 100% recommend  Moxie and Terry to anyone who needs their services. We look forward to continuing our services through them.<//Review>

We really want to thank the technician that came out to service our home. He with out any hesitation, put our packages that accumulated while we were gone up to the porch area from the sidewalk outside the gate. What he did was put our packages out of site from the street so it wouldn't be taken by thieves. So truly, thank you for going above and beyond. 👍</text>

Josh the salesperson was very professional and helped explain everything. He was able to get us scheduled for the next day. Pricing was fair. Andrew came and was professional and courteous. He asked questions to determine where the trouble areas were. He did his job and didn’t disturb me after we talked. The documentation was great to let me know exactly what he did. I then got confirmation emails about what was done and what to expect.<//text>

Dee was very proactive about getting my wife and I the appropriate treatment. He really went the extra mile to make sure that our problem with a sudden flea infestation from our son's dog's recent visit was resolved. He was polite, professional, patient and thorough.

I changed from  Lloyds to Moxie because they don’t use such toxic chemicals that I have to take my pets away for 4 hours after a service.  I am also more aware of the toxic  effect of chemicals in our environment and on our health, so this is important. Moxie is very prompt at fixing a problem, and are always extremely courteous to deal with!</review>

I board dogs for overnights and day visits and I enjoy knowing I am doing my best to keep unwelcome spiders away from my family and I many dog noses in my yard.

The first appointment went fine when i signed up for a year contract and paid. BUT the company is set up to getting people hooked the first time, then they don’t care. They give half off the first appointment, and if you later cancel the yearly contract you have to pay back the 2nd half. So, when the service quality plummets, YOU HAVE TO PAY to stop working with them.

My 2nd appointment was a horrible experience.

It took over a week to get a call back to get the appointment after calling multiple times. When I repeatedly called and chose "existing customer" the wait was consistently long or no answer, or in the case of Saturday afternoon when my appointment was, it went straight to voice mail. However, when I called back and choose "new customer" my call was quickly answered.

When the technician arrived, I showed him all the issues. Ants, spiders, and rodents outside. We discussed placing bait traps and where they’d go, spraying inside and out, and removing all the spider webs. I asked him to call me when he was done and took my children to the park down the street.

I received no call.
He placed no bait traps.
Left webs and spiders around the house.
He left the FRONT DOOR WIDE OPEN!

So, I again called Moxie multiple times again to get it resolved. Each time the very nice customer service people said they sent a message marked Urgent, until I finally got called back with a new time. During the appointment time window I waited 2 hours and NO ONE SHOWED UP.

For a 3rd time I called Moxie multiple times, each ending with an Urgent message being sent, and I have still not received a call back 2 days later.

Choose any other pest control service!< /text>

Bryce was great!! With few exceptions, I have always found Moxie technicians pleasant, competent and thorough.   However, Bryce exceeded all expectations.  With it being a reservice, I figured it would be just a quick once over.  But to my delight, Bryce went above and beyond to attend to all areas of concern.  He even pointed out an issue, of which I was unaware,  that will definitely require additional attention.  Thank you Bryce, thank you Moxie!< /text>

Always on time, and with plenty of advance notice.

<Text>I was convinced to switch my service to Moxie by a door to door sales guy. He told me there was no contract and no fee to cancel... We just sold our home and we are now moving out of state and of course they charged me $190 to cancel and threatened collections if it wasn't paid. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH MOXIE. Very shady sales tactics.<//Text>< Name>

Terry was a friendly, professional technician who took his time to make sure everything was taken care of in our house and yard.  We had previously switched to another company who was cheaper, but came back to Moxie for the superior service.  We won't be leaving them again.  Thanks Terry.  And thanks Moxie!</text>

Do not sign a contract with this group!!!  They will make you pay an early termination fee to cancel even if the service performed was poor. I also asked about an organic option and they said that service would be a monthly service at $99 per month.  The office staff is also not helpful and tell you multiple different answers to the same question.  I have asked to speak to a manager, and all any of the account mangers tell me is they have no manager/boss.  This is a very poorly run company, and I would stay far away from them for pest solutions.<//review>

Jack was professional and responsive to requests.  He seemed  to know what to do and how to do it well.   I give Moxie a high rating based on this initial visit.  Final opinion will have to wait until we see if spiders are gone in about 30 days.<//Review>

They are usually great and thorough, doing their job well. However, this last visit, which was just 2 days ago, was left somewhat incomplete. Part of their service is to wipe down the outside walls of the house, in order to get rid of cobwebs, etc. This time I was surprised to find that although most of the walls were wiped down, there were obvious places that were simply ignored. I was outside checking the walls today and needed to grab a broom and wipe down cobwebs in the areas that were missed. Since I am short, it is difficult for me to reach those high places. I also would appreciate it if the equipment that the technician needs to walk by and reach over, when wiping down the walls, such as the air conditioner and the pool heater, would be wiped down as well. In general, their service has always been good. For whatever reason, the technician didn't completely do the job this time.</text>

Moxie came this Friday to do service for my home and the two gentleman Jorge and Mike sprayed the outside and inside home. Both were very quick and efficient and prepared. Very courteous and had the answers to my questions and were able to recommend based on their knowledge. Even if it rains the products works so rain or shine, Moxie is there!< /review>

Brijan was awesome! I was uncomfortable having him come through my home to my back patio due to a recent surgery and he willingly hopped my fence and performed all of the necessary spraying and mouse trap replacement. He did so with a smile on his face and was professional and efficient. 👍👍👍< /review>

Our technician Andrew was super responsive to my concerns and listened patiently to my stories of bugs and spiders around my home. I felt 100% confident that he would do everything he could to start the process of ridding my home of these buggers! I would be greatful to have him back each quarter to keep my home bug/spider free!<//text>

We have been Moxie customers for over 3 years and couldn’t be happier and satisfied with the service we receive.  Customer service from the office to the Field Agent is A+. I don’t believe I have ever experienced a company who values their clients with such importance.  I have had other companies come to my door trying to sell their services at a lower price and I tell them that I would not consider changing from Moxie as I am very loyal customer!!!< /review>

He was friendly and courteous when first appearing at my front door to announce his visit.  He politely listened while I explained a few points of personal interest I wished to draw his attention to during his visit.  He then proceeded to efficiently perform his duties.  Upon completion he again presented his good-natured self at the front door to explain what he'd accomplished and to present the receipt and oversize Moxie business card. Totally great job overall!</review>< pictures>

She is most helpful and exudes a cheerful, pleasant, and professional phone demeanor. Will and another technician came out to spray for ants, ticks, flees, and spiders. They were very professional a did a really thorough job. He also pointed out that we had white fly infestation with our plumerias and that sometime we should discuss dealing with that.
I really enjoy the personal interest and respectful professional attitude.
Thanks again for taking care of us.

<Review>Yesterday, we got a knock on our door from Riley, a Moxie rep.  He was friendly and professional and convinced me very quickly that we needed Moxie’s service by pointing out the spider egg sacks in our yard after i showed him where we get spider webs most often.  He explained Moxie’s service model and offered us a very good price to sign up for their service.  I am so glad he came to our door!

I got a phone call and a text this morning from the company confirming the service time and providing a summary of information that was discussed with Riley.

Doug K. provided excellent service today. He was friendly and quick.  He explained everything he was going to do up front and confirmed that he actually did it at the end.  Doug was able to clear out all of the spider webs and egg sacks from our yard in about 35 minutes.

I would highly recommend this company to all of my neighbors and friends in the area!< /Review>< Pictures>

Keaton was super cool.  Easy to talk to and explained everything up front.  He was also super respectful and made sure to ask about access inside the house before going in.  Had a great attitude and was done in an appropriate amount of time.  Glad to use this company and their service.  Now we’ll see if the spiders truly do go away!!!</review>

I found a mouse in my bedroom this morning. I called Moxie who was able to send Jorge out today. I HAD to have it gone asap. Jorge arrived within the two hour window. He caught it quickly in an environmentally way. I would add to make sure the agent repeats your address back to you to make sure they have it right. I am thrilled and relieved Jorge came today. He was friendly, professional and fast. I highly recommend Moxie and will definitely use them again if the need arises.<//Text>

I received my text message that Jason the technician would arrive within 30 minutes and he was right on time. He was helpful and knowledgeable while explaining what he would do during the visit. He answered all the questions I had and gave me some tips for after he sprayed. Jason cleared all the spider webs all around my home including our patio furniture, all in all it was well worth the money. I have noticed dead spiders around the areas where the spraying happened so so far so good!<//review>< username>

Even though I did not sign up with Moxie (I use a pest control company owned by a friend of mine), I was still so impressed by their Route Manager that I had to leave a review! His name was Tai Tumanuvao and he was extremely kind, knowledgeable and honest. When I shared that I already had service with a close friend’s company, he didn’t apply any pressure, but actually stuck around and answered some big related questions I had. This was a welcomed change from the usual “High pressure” sales tactics of other pest control companies that have visited my home. I can only imagine that Tai’s calm demeanor and helpful approach is indicative of a company wide culture. THANK YOU TAI!!!< /text>

This service does what they say. We needed pest control for some rat activity we were seeing on our back wall. Moxie has placed bait traps in 2 places and, no more rats. They also, of course do the normal spiderweb maintaining and Argentinian ants spray too. The guys we have dealt with all neat and articulate.I would recommend them.<//review>

<text>Just started up service with Moxie.  From the initial set up which was very easy on the phone, to meeting the technician Alan when he came for the first service today, I've been very pleased with the experience so far.  Alan was friendly, very thorough and respectful, and also explained what to expect over the next few weeks leading up to their next visit.  Refreshing to finally have a professional outfit for our pest control needs.  Last company we used said their office representative would contact me to set us up with a recurring maintenance schedule but they never called.< /text><resp>{'time': 1567784676414, 'text': "Welcome to Moxie, Shannon!

BEWARE!  Extremely unethical and unprofessional company!  Do not live up to their promise, tech recognized that after three visits, we still had black widows and ants but when I got a cancellation fee the office claimed the tech said it was clean from black widows and ants.  I had to hire an attorney to have them stop trying to collect on cancellation fees.<//Review>

I was using another service for spiders and was incredibly underwhelmed by the efficacy of the service I received. Upon speaking with Moxie, I made a switch with confidence, particularly due to their satisfaction guarantee and the attention to detail exhibited by the salesperson, Riley.
Will administered my initial service. He took his time and was extremely thorough in eradicating all the webs.
I look forward to enjoying my yard once again.<//Review>

It was day one of treatment, so I can’t yet speak to the actual effectiveness of the product, but customer service has been stellar. From my first phone call with Ashley to schedule, up to the arrival of Mike at our door, the service has been courteous and responsive. Mike was knowledgeable and explained all the steps in detail. We hope the product is as fantastic as the team behind it!</Text>

Miguel arrived early and was also training, Josh, a new staff member. Josh reviewed with me that they were careful with our pet tortoises, edible plants/herbs, and they addressed the problems with ants and spiders. Both were careful and thorough with the pest service. Miguel is always welcome at our home.< /Review>

<Text>We signed up with Moxie about 1 year ago and have not been disappointed. I used to bug my husband to do something about all of the spider in our yard. This is when we hired Moxie! We have been very happy with the service and professional work that they have provided. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great pest control company.<//Text>< UserId.>

I e been using Moxie for over a year now and haven’t had any ant issues and they routinely clean out all the spider webs around the outer house and patio furniture.  Highly recommend.

Thanks to Miguel Munoz for the great service trip today.</text>

With the summer heat, we saw an increase in ant activity in the backyard, and after point it out to our technician, he went over our property with a fine tooth comb.  We have not had any more ants invade the house and we are so grateful - Moxie is responsive and reliable.  Totally worth it.</text>

<text>Awesome Pest Control Service!!!
Our Field Expert ANDREW F.  was THE best going above and beyond the call of duty, removing a baby wasp nest and even bringing in some heavy packages I had delivered.
Andrew F. was thorough throughout the whole backyard, and removed all spider webs from fences and patio furniture.
Thank you Andrew F.! See you next month!</text><name>Lynch Family VLOGS</name><userid>104665788467776120386</userid>< Pics>

<Text>Alan Melchor was my technician today and did a great job making sure my yard and house were treated for ants and spiders.  He refilled the bait box with new mice bait as all of the previous baits had been consumed by mice.  I am surprised that we have not seen the pests around the house or yard, but are happy they are going somewhere else to die.

Mike from Moxie came out to do our first spray and was very professional and informative. What impressed me most was the extra time he took to show me where the root of our ant problem was coming from. He also patiently answered the thousands of questions by inquisitive son threw at him.  His knowledge and expertise made me feel confident in our decision to sign up Moxie for quarterly treatments in our home .<//Text>

They are the easiest company to communicate with. They always let me know 30 min before they show up and if I ever have a problem they respond right away.

And Alan was super nice and very accommodating.  They are the nicest company for bug spraying I have ever dealt with. Definitely the best company around.< /Review>

< Review>
After having Moxie Pest Control come out about a month ago we notice fleas in our back yard. One call was all it took and they were back on the job that day! At no cost to me they resprayed and added more granules. Thank you Gary for being prompt, efficient and accommodating. Highly recommend this company!<//Review>

We had a problem before about leaving the property open for a four hour window. You heard my phone call and we figured something out to make it work with a two hour window and a 30 minute phone call before show up. Thank you so much<//review>

<Review>Gary was our field expert today, and he did a great job, as far as I can tell. He de-webbed our outdoor area and furniture before spraying which I can say our last company we had did not. He was nice and efficient. Thank you! Oh- and the Customer service gal who signed me up was great too- her name was Ashley! :) She knew all the info and went above and beyond in explaining it to me.<//Review>< userid>

<Review>Great service at an affordable price. Product used it pet safe. Dog friendly techs.  Our service rep today, Andrew, abused us not to use the granules in grass because of our tortoise.  He mentioned this without is even asking. They care and their stuff works.  Highly recommend.< /Review>< response>

We've been using Moxie for a couple of years and have been very pleased with their service.  Love the fact that their treatments are pet and child friendly/safe. Today's unexpected visit (at no cost) was for fleas (ugh)...the field expert, Gary, was friendly and professional; answered all of my questions; and explained a few other things I didn't think of. Overall, another good experience. Thank you, Gary and Moxie.< /text>

He was the first technician to both address & give me products for silverfish & moths.

The service provided was efficient and thorough. He was respectful of my wishes to avoid spraying of my vegetable garden and fruit trees.
He informed me of the brown widows he found in a lounge chair I had turned over.
I then was able to turn over all my furniture and kill the rest. I will make sure to turn over all my furniture in the future
I am very happy with the service provided.</Review>

Moxie has been taking care of my ant and pest problem for a couple of years.  Service has been great;  but I wish they could attach a note to my account not to spray in my back yard.

I have a 50 year old tortoise and would like him avoid digesting poison chemicals --- this would help him live another 50 years.

Thanks Moxie ......  from Bob & 'Speedy the Turtle'.<//Text>

I can not say enough good things about Moxie. They come when they say they will be there, the people are helpful and  courteous and they follow up on there service to make sure everything is taken care of. I had a  Hibiscus plant that was very  sentimental  To as it was my mothered who recently passed away. It was infested with white flies. Moxie came out every few days to a week, for 6 treatments times and saved it. This was all done for the same price as my usual visit. They call/text after each visit to see how my plant was doing. They will always be my choice for pest control. Thank you and my plant thanks you.</text>

<Date>1563913206316< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Had our 1st Moxie treatment today with Doug. He came 10 minutes early which was very helpful. I’m not sure if he was planning to do the inside of my house and garage but he was happy to do so when I asked him. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. We have issues with spiders, wasps,  and recently have been dealing with fleas. In my dogs 13 years, they have had fleas twice. We took them to the vet, got flea meds, and have noticed they still scratch a bit. Not as much as before and I can’t visibly see any but we don’t want to mess around. Our experience with the sales rep, office folks, and technician has been top notch so far.< /Review>< GmapID>

I didn't get to meet Bryce, but from the looks of the outside, all the webs are destroyed and I feel like we will be pest free on our property.

Moxi is a good value. We live on an ant hill pretty much so they keep us ant free. They also get rid of the wasp nests. The recent technician who serviced us found ant trails and nests that I didn’t notice and sprayed or baited them. Really friendly service.  I’d recommend them highly.<//review>

Have had Moxie for a few years. No bugs of an kind. They come automatically quarterly (or on demand should you need them). Very professional in all aspects. Call/text you a reminder a few days before your scheduled appointment, text you a heads up a half hour before arriving, and announce when they arrive before accessing your property and grounds for service. Very pleasant and polite reps. Afterwards, they advise the depth of the service performed, and provide a copy and receipt. Also, they use pet safe products!!!. We are very satisfied with their service.< /text>

We just started service with Moxie and their technician, Doug, was on the job when I came home from a morning appointment.  He was friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough.  He was nice to our old dog, too.  I suppose all of the companies use similar or same chemicals, so it's the service that counts and Doug was great.</review>

<Text>BEWARE !!! The Worst! They are a complete waste of money. First they don't get rid of bugs then say they have free follow ups, after 3 follow ups they checked on me i sent them video of lines of ants I've had for months. They sent out another tech who didn't go anywhere near the area I showed them and had the nerve to tell me it was a quarterly service which I  needed to pay for. I refused and now without any follow up no letter, no email no phone call they sent that last unsuccessful trip charge to a collection agency. SCAMMERS! I will not be extorted<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1575316518745, 'text': "Anthony, we've been trying to get in touch with you to discuss your account but have been unsuccessful.

<text>I am so HAPPY with the results of service provided by MOXIE!
Jorge and his assistant explained potential reasons for my stubborn ant problem. They used 3 different methods of treatment inside my home.
After months  and months of chronic ant travel all over my kitchen and bathroom areas I truly think we are 'ant free'.  And I have been assured that if they are not really gone I can call for MOXIE to revisit.

I am truly impressed by the explicit invoices - listing products used to treat my pest issues.

And I love the customer service on the phones -POLITE, easy to understand, and PROMPT! I am switching to MOXIE and will stop using my previous pest control company.
Thank you again to Spencer for telling me why I needed to give MOXIE a try.

Our tech arrived on time, was professional and courteous. He explained his exterminating process and answered all my questions.
I rate Doug highly thus far, the real test being whether or not the ants and other insects are eradicated.</Text>

Nikolas Stow was very professional and accommodating.  He was very polite and positive.  He sprayed the affected areas, took away webs (and their spiders), inspected and treated the landscape, and explained what he accomplished at the end of the treatment.    We were very impressed by his knowledge and willingness to please.  We felt very taken care of by a very caring technician.  Thank you, Nikolas!</review>

When Mike came out on a rainy Saturday morning, he was ready to get to work. Asked if we knew of any problems or had any concerns. Let him know where we saw some ants and he said he would take care of that. Mike was very nice, respectful, and courteous.  He did a good job and we have been satisfied over the past few years we have used Moxie.< /review>

<text>Christian was very polite and also very knowledgeable about the product and how and what it does. Seemed very thorough. After they left we had an issue with the exterior as there were still spider webs in some areas. We still have ant issues (which was to be expected); so we will see how that goes.
All in all good job.< /text>< Pics>

Moxie has helped our home get rid of our crazy ant problem. Everyone that we have ever talked with on the phone has been super helpful and friendly. Every technician that has serviced our home has been professional, friendly and informative. We are beyond happy with the customer service and work Moxie has done to keep our home pest free.< /Text>

Justin at Moxie Pest Control did an excellent job for us.  He was very thorough and was knowledgeable about the different pests in my yard. When he finished, he explained everything that he had done very clearly to me. I highly recommend Justin and Moxie Pest Control.</Review>

<Review>This salesperson from orange county was in menifee trying to sell me the service and was really pushy with little boundaries. I went in my house to discuss it with my wife and came back out and I told him that I like to take my time and that I will follow up with him asap, because I was actually interested in the service. I said "that's your number on that magnet you gave me right?" He responds "I'm going to have to take that magnet back since your not a customer." I was done at that point and assertively asked him to get off my property and threw that business card out my door way. He didn't want to leave. I went from asking him to leave to having to tell him 3 times to get off my property. You can keep your petty magnet! You will never have my business!!! I will make sure my neighbors know.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Really appreciated the time and consideration Mike showed my wife and during Moxie's recently scheduled visit. Aside from the routine spraying, he was courteous enough to recommend a better placement for the outdoor trap and took the time to check inside the house. He took his time in answering our questions that allowed us to make a more informed decision on next steps. Thanks Mike!<//review>< rating>

Jorge and Jacob were awesome! They had finished at another job early and contacted me to see if I would like them to come earlier or simply keep the same time. I opted for the earlier slot. 15 minutes before the time agreed upon, I arrived at the house and they were around the corner waiting (they did not know I arrived). It was nice to see people actually be on time, and in their case, early!

When the appointment time arrived, they evaluated the house, went over the services I requested, and went right to work. They were incredibly friendly and in and out before we even knew it.

Great service from 2 great technicians!

Dennis Izvoreanu did a fabulous job and was thoughtful and considerate. I have an infestation of fungus gnats in an area with overgrowth waiting for construction.  Normally the application deals with spiders and ants with no trouble. This was a recent development of overgrowth and some rain a few weeks ago. The infestation will need an additional application in a few weeks to assure offspring are treated as well. Treatment is included in maintenance. 😊<//text>

Wouldn’t call me back when I had specific questions about my service. Emailed me after he performed the service stating that there were wasp nests by a window on my house. He further stated that “he couldn’t reach them” so he “sprayed them”. I wanted to know with what did he spray them? Pesticide? Water?  The window was open so did any get into the house? And isn’t your job to get rid of the pests? So why didn’t he figure out a way to do his job?  I’m finished with this very poor company with awful customer service.< /text>

Great service! I canceled my previous pest control service after they sold to Terminix. I am so pleased with all the well mannered young men that helped me. Zack sold me on the program yesterday and Andrew came out today and did my first treatment. So thankful to find a company the uses only plant based material and has knowledgable men working for them. Thank you Moxie team!</text>

Moxie pest control has been to my house twice. They are a high energy, super positive company and they are very meticulous about their work. From tilting patio chairs up to get rid of web and spray, to doing walk around as I point out webs that have bothered me they are good listener and have made sure that I'm happy. Good job guys!  I don't remember the name of the fellow who came the first time but he was amazing! Mike and Brendan came today and did a fantastic job!</review>

Moxie has provided excellent service in the several years I have been using them to service the pest control issues in my home.  They perform quarterly service and come out at no charge between sevices to address immediate issues at no extra charge.  I had two serious ant invasions at different times.  I called Moxie and they had a technician out the next day. The ant issue was resolved almost immediately — it took a few days for the ants to carry the poison back to the nest and wipe out the nest. The technicians have all been courteous, friendly and efficient and the phone crew is equally pleasant to deal with.  Moxie gets that excellent customer service is the key to success in a very competitive service business such as theirs. I have nothing but good things to say regarding my years of experience with Moxie and I highly recommend them.< /review>

My technician Preston showed up on time for my service.  He was polite, informative, and worked around my new baby and hectic household when he came here. He asked me where the trouble areas were and focused on both the interior and exterior.  He sprayed the outside thoroughly.  He was professional, courteous and continued to answer any questions I had.  I'm satisfied with my service and will continue to use Moxie!  Thank you Preston for your service.<//review>

Today Andrew came around to treat our beach house for rodents.  He is not only good at what he does, but is one of the sweetest guys you will ever meet.  Once again Moxie goes above and beyond.</review>

Andrew Fetner did a very thorough job. He was professional and personable. He was not detoured from several obstacles in our backyard. Every technician who has provided service at our house have provided the same great service. Keep up the good work.<//Review>

<Review>I was told by the salesman that the chemicals they use were pet friendly and yet, I find out these are really strong chemicals that can kill my bird, dogs and fish.

After following the guy spraying, he said he doesnt even spray higher than his hips....what about the wasps up high? What about the spiders in the bushes????

Now I feel they got me locked into a year contract that I cannot break. You need to beware if you are not getting the proper service. This is our first day and I am already disappointed.</Review>< Pictures>

I had wish the company had given us a time for his visit. As it turned out we were home. He did a very thorough job of spraying around the  perimeter of our home and checked bate traps for activity. The lawn was also sprinkled with a granular  herbicide. I would ask for this person for our next quarterly treatment.<//Text>

Today was my first day of service with Moxie. I will begin by giving Moxie a 5 star review based on the super service by the sales people. They were 5 star informative and courteous  over the phone.  I could feel the smiles coming through the phone☺️.   When my technician, Luis came he reaffirmed all that I had been told by the sales people .  Luis asked me a few questions, O wait! I gotta add that he arrived right on time and that  again is 5 stars. Anyway Luis asked some specific questions for my property and explained everything he was going to do, And explained it in a manner  I could understand (that's important to me) then went on to do the work. I watched him tearing down webs while caring for patio furniture even underneath (I hate those pesky spiders that make their webs there and you can't sit outside at night for fear of getting bit) when finished he gave me an assessment of what he found including wasps nests which I wasn't aware of but is included in the fee. All was completed in about 30 min. ( inside is included but won't use that service unless I have to).  Lastly my Gardner was scheduled to come and didn't know if that would be a concern,so I called and was told that it actually will help spread the pet friendly granules, kool! All in All first day experience I'll give them 5 stars.  Ask for Luis as your tech .<//Review>

Moxie is always response  to our needs. Our technician was Jason Fox. He was professional and  courteous. Fox was very thorough and explain everything in a manner that easy to understand. In an era where exceptional one-to-one excellent customer service has virtually disappeared, Fox is an example for other technicians to emulate.</text>

<Review>I normally do not write reviews, but last week on August 13th. 2016 I had my first service from Moxie Pest Control. Although I am a bit late in writing my review, I feel its only appropriate considering the service I received. From my first meeting with the sales rep. Gordon D. to the actual service the following day with Kevin F.....was by far the best experience I have ever had with any company! Gordon was very professional, answered every question I had, took his time, and never rushed me. On Sat. when Kevin arrived, he was also very professional, exceptionally kind, and did a fantastic job! Five stars is not enough for these two! VERY happy with the whole company!

Thank you Gordon, and Kevin! I truly appreciate the both of you!

<review>Been using Moxie for a year. I never imagined I would need pest control as I mostly did DIY spraying previously. However, we had one year where our external property seemingly had a brown widow spider epidemic and my kids were getting bad welts from spider bites. Went with Moxie as the service offering and value seemed fair compared to competitors. Haven't been disappointed. Although I still see small and tiny house spiders, all of the big baddies are long gone (and I forgot to mention, aggressive ants in the house are long GONE too!). I only have them come quarterly and it's been good enough for me, although they are happy to come in between scheduled visits if I ask. Thanks Moxie!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Ozzie - I had been seeing multiple spiders in the house and little bugs in my bathtubs. Ozzie was very informative with what to do with the bathtubs to help clear out the tiny black bugs. He was quick and efficient and patient, I have two dogs and a baby. He definitely made things extremely easy and was great overall.</text>

This was the best pest control company experience ever.  From the sales rep, Tyber Parsons, who came to my door, to the actual service itself later that day from Christian Jacobo. Even the phone call that I received to verify my start up and details was so great.   Very professional, friendly, courteous and thorough!

<Text>I had Moxie Pest Control come out today for my quarterly service.  I really do appreciate their flexibility in providing service on Saturday as I want to be sure I'm home whenever anyone comes out to the house so that I can look after the dogs.  Technician Jamie Stroud did an excellent job. He pointed out to me those areas in my yard which had the most activity and ensured me that they were well treated.  He also gave me good guidance in regards to how long I should wait before letting the dogs back outside.< /Text><user_id>109864890972046241799<//user_id>< Rate>

Keith H. came out and sprayed my home for ants. The hot weather has brought loads of these creatures in and out. He gave me a hint for dealing with my white flies and reminded me not to wet mop or water for a day after spraying. He was so thorough and kind giving me hints to rid the outside and inside of pests. Great job, Keith.</review>

Bryce is super knowledgeable, friendly, and thorough! He went above and beyond to answer my questions, take time to understand our problem areas, and to take some extra steps to help eliminate some of the issues that we haven’t been able to overcome with ants and spiders. I was really happy with the service he provided!

Koby was on time, very professional, worked fast, and he offered more than what I expected to fix our ant problem. He did a great job!!

Jacob was friendly, attentive, and accommodating to our needs!<//review>

Trevor came by yesterday and treated my property. He was on time, clean, and well mannered. He asked if I was having any problem area and told me exactly what he was going to do and what products he was using. He was even able to identify a tree I had growing in my backyard that I had no idea what it was. Great service!< /Text>

We had a mysterious infestation of small worm-like things in our backyard. Bryce Overland came and took a look and knew immediately what they were and how to treat it. He was quick and efficient and knowledgeable. I love that between our regular treatments Moxie comes to treat these emergency situations complementary. Thank you Moxie and Bryce for your great service!<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Taylor came to service our home today. Stellar service from an exceptionally polite young guy. Even by Moxie's standards (which are high) - he is the best.  He was very thorough and went beyond the normal quarterly pest control service to make sure we are protected by putting down additional spray for spiders and granules for the ants.
Moxie have been our company of choice for the past 9 months and we are more than satisifed with their service. They come back out anytime we spot anything in between scheduled visits.A++  thanks Moxie, thanks Taylor<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Had Caleb out today.We had primarily and ant issue and spiders secondarily. He explained how he would treat for each with both dry pellets and then 2 different wet sprays. We keep getting door to door salespeople trying to get us to go with a different company. They just don't get it that bashing the competition does not work. I am happy with Moxie.<//review><userid>104064465000590232473< /userid></record>

Luis knocked on my door & before I could say no, he said everything I needed to hear from a pest control co in such a polite manner, I said YES! The next day Russell & Joseph showed up right on time, professional in attitude & appearance, they did everything Luis had said they would. The were quick & thorough, doing all the places I had talked about with the salesman, Luis the night before. I would recommend Moxie simply for their polite employees! Thanks again guys< /Text>

Antonio did what most people don’t do , he listened then showed me the different chemicals he would apply and why he wouldn’t apply  the different chemicals to same location , it was a learning experience, the other two companies I used , applied the same chemical for all the location , my daughter gave me this company and I’m glad to use them and hope that others will give them a try , you won’t be disappointed, Antonio you did a Great Job  Thanks

This is now the third time he has serviced the house , he is very thorough in all areas of the property always done in about 20 min and spends time asking if I have any specific problem areas , a class A worker<//Review>

<Review>Our Moxie specialist, Mike, was very professional. He explained everything that he planned to do and what to expect. We had a major invasion of ants, even after regular service within the last month. This visit and treatment was free, as part of Moxie's service. Mike said they will follow-up to see if this helps resolve the problem or they will come back out. We have animals, so we are careful in how we treat the ants. Again, he was knowledgeable and attentive to our needs and concerns.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Ozzie came today as scheduled.  As always he was courteous and professional.  He completed the service and explained how the chemicals are administered and how they work for the pests.  He gave me my receipt and offered additional services as needed.  I'm satisfied and am happy he is my service provider.<//text>< pictures>

My tech today was Jered. He was friendly and thorough. He took care of a wasp nest I had no idea existed and set a trap for a mouse we've been trying to catch. He was very detailed in explaining what he completed for the day and how he would take of the wasps nest and mouse. Very courteous and friendly manner.< /review>

Today we had our house serviced by Lou and Hector. They did a great job. They listened to my concerns and offered solutions. I appreciate the time the spent at our house. They acted like our house was their only house on the list but in reality I know they were quite busy today. Thank you for the great customer service and care for our home.<//text>

He was quick and efficient setting the traps up and assured us the issue would be taken care of. I am going to be requesting Luis Flores next time I have a service scheduled.</Review>

We have been using Moxie for the past two years and they have always provided excellent service.  We were especially impressed by today's service which was provided by Ocean.  In addition to the regular quarterly treatment, he also sprayed for fleas/ticks, (both inside and out) when I mentioned that I had seen fleas.  He was polite, professional and thorough.  Thanks for keeping our home bug free.</Text>

I just finished working with Bryce Overland.  He came by to help us control whatever was digging up our garden areas.  He said it could be possums or racoons, but the best fix would be to kill the grubs in the ground that they are looking for.  What a great idea!  I certainly don't want to kill the animals but this solution was perfect - to remove their food source .

Bryce was friendly, very helpful, and efficient in his work.  I find all the technicians at Moxie to be  very good, lfriendly and knowledgeable people.< /text>

Our technician David Huerta was awesome. I've had Moxie almost a year now and this is the fisrt time I was happy with our home visit. Usually someone comes and sprays very quick and is gone, but this time David actually took time and effort, he even sprayed our picnic tables. Thank you David for doing a great job and for being so kind.</Review>

Luis was very courteous and helpful. He was here on a very hot day, but was super friendly, and checked all the issues I told him about. He even suggested I call for an extra service appointment, which comes at no charge, to re-bait my rat traps.  I have no ants in my house even during this hot weather, due to Moxie's continued treatment. Thank you!< /text>

In addition to rodents a d insects, also caught a couple of scorpions this time in our garage near the door inside.

Jorge (license # RA 60660)  and Luis just left my house and I am super impressed with the job they did. Turned all furniture to spray for spiders, covered the lawn for fleas, and got every space I could see for ants.   They even sprayed down to the bottom of my stairs into our canyon..... a long way down and all with a smile.  They also understand the difference between black and brown spiders that I do not want to surprise me vs the beautiful Orb spiders making and maintaining webs in my plants that keep us entertained and in awe.

Thanks guys, you are professional, well dressed, polite and great at what you do. I will request you back from now on if that is possible.<//Text>

We have had an ant problem for the past few years, which seemed to get worse in the summer due to the heat. We tried almost every product you can buy in the store and nothing seemed to work. We were recommended Moxie by some of our neighbors and decided to give it a try. Our technician Seth arrived on time and explained exactly what he was doing. He did a great job and am happy with the work thus far.<//Review>

Moxie rep came to house. Sprayed outside. I told him about sugar ants in my kitchen.  He put some clear goo where they were coming in and said they would eat it and bring it back to the nest and kill other ants. 😃< /review>

Always on time. Took care of my ants.
The technician did a thorough inspection in my yard.  He found the starting point where the ants were gathering.  I had not seen ants like this for a couple years and he explained  where and why they were there.  He also informed us of mosquitos.   He treated all the areas including my grass as well as indoors.
Great job!!</review>

Jaime and Simon provide excellent service.  Jaime explained a newer product and how it works.  They were careful with potted plants and chairs in the back yard.  All in all, just friendly and courteous.

We had our initial service with Moxie and we are very satisfied with our service. Our technician, David Jimenez, did a wonderful job. His customer service skills were excellent. He sprayed the exterior and interior of our home and took the time to go over everything with me and answered all of my questions. We our looking forward to seeing our results and having our follow-up next month. We were referred by family and couldn't be happier with the service we received.< /Review>

My technician was very knowledgeable. I informed him of the problem with large roaches. He told me what they were and what they are looking for. He told me what Moxie will do to stop them from entering my home. I appreciate he took his time and helped me with the problem and not simply just spray the perimeter.<//text>

Jorge came out for the first visit of our 1 year subscription and did an awesome job! The ant problem in our house was REAL. Like invading the bathroom, kitchen, all over the trash bins outside, even in my bed........super gross. Every single day there would be a new source of critters crawling into the house. Jorge sprayed and set traps 5 days ago and I haven’t seen a SINGLE bug since! He said to expect an increase in ant activity for the next couple of weeks, but I literally haven’t seen anything, and it’s so refreshing to be able to sleep through the night without worrying about being awoken by ants lol. Thank you, Moxie! Great price, great customer service, and I’m looking forward to the next visit to continue the trend of our new, bug-free home!<//text>

Today my house was treated for ants, snails and rats. Keith Harris did a fabulous job and I totally recommend Moxie Pest Control. Since I have been using them I have had no problem with ants.</review>

Simon serviced our property today.   My wife was very happy with his professionalism and attentiveness to solving our problem with spiders, rats and caterpillars.  He was very knowledgeable, took his time,  and was much more thorough than technicians we have had previously.  We feel comfortable that the problems have been solved, but if they haven't, we know that Simon made every effort to rid us of the pests, and Moxie will willingly come out again if we see new activity.   We were very pleased with the service we received and Simon was great.</Text>

Your service provider did a great job!

We were home all day. I never saw a moxie pest control truck or person. Maybe he slipped in and out so quickly we missed him. Nothing at the front door to tell us he was here
I just checked the bait boxes and I am positive he did not check them. Lots of debris at the entrance and exit hole and on top of box. One box so sunk in dirt a rat would not have been able to get inside if it wanted to.</Text>

So far so great! Day 1 was today. Bramdon was great door to door sales. He said I could get service today with @3pm, it was 2:30pm...15 min later got a call from his offices, confirming service for same day. 3pm  David Huerta was at our my door for service. Super friendly and easy going. made quick work of spider webs, putting down mice/mouse trap and spraying. Going to make sure he comes out for next service. So far everyone is very well trained and super friendly. so far interacted with 3 people and all aced the test. I hope it continues, but so far so great!< /Text>

My husband recently got bitten by ants and broke out in hives. I googled and expecting these are fire ants. I called Moxie and they send out tech Luis Flores. He was very knowledgeable and help us set up pesticides to get rid of these ants. He also treated the foundation of property just in case these ants decides to crawl in. Will definitely call moxie for all my future pest problems.<//Text>

They first rang the doorbell to let me know they were there, to inform me of what they will be doing, and to ask if there were any specific problems I have been noticing or specific areas that I needed to be treated.

When they were done, they rang the doorbell to remind me what was done, and then asked if I needed anything else.  They also reminded me that if I notice any pest problems before the next visit, then I can contact Moxie to have a technician come out again at no additional charge.

We have used Moxie for a little over 2 years to control our ant, spider, and rodent issues, and are completely satisfied with their service.  They are professional and customer-service oriented. Technician Simon Bone came just today and did such a thorough job that I felt I had to give him a thumbs up.  I especially appreciate that I can call Moxie whenever we spot a problem and they'll schedule a technician visit at a convenient time.</Review>

Alonso was my technician and he was very thorough in explaining how he would go about eliminating our bug problem. He also asked if I had any questions regarding the procedure. He was very friendly, kind, and cared about my concern over the pesticides that are used. He reassured me that there would be no harm to my children or my dogs. I am very satisfied with the service and with the Moxie Pest experience that Alonso provided. I look forward to doing future business with Moxie Pest Services.</review>

<Review>I've been using this service for a couple of years now and I've always been impressed by their service. Today, Simon came to do the service and he was meticulous about taking care of every little web or spider egg sack under patio furniture and in flower beds. But he was also careful not to put any treatments in my vegetable garden beds.
Thank you, Simon, and everyone at Moxie who keeps my yard from being overrun by spiders and ants!</Review>< pictures>

This is our first time hiring a pest control service.   Goodbye ants!  Luis & Nina are fantastic,  friendly and very professional! Bramdon who came door to door and sold us on the idea of pest control,  came art exactly the right time - ant season!   He was also very professional and able to answer all of my questions.  I am very satisfied so far,  having just finished my first treatment.   I highly recommend this company,  you won't be disappointed.<//review>

This young man did an outstanding Job! He followed me all around my home, spotted trouble and explained the problem. I was going crazy trying to figure out who was eating sun flower seeds in my side yard, he picked one up and asked if I had a bird feeder, I don't. He looked over the fence and pointed out several bird feeders in my neighbors yard. He placed appropriate traps to mitigate the problem and explained points of entry for mice/rats in my outdoor storage units. Great Job, actually deserves a 10!< /Review>

<review>For some reason I cannot pull the evaluation boxes up on my computer but I would like to say that Jorge Gonzalez and Blaine Whitmore were very cordial and completed the service very quickly.  Blaine knocked the cobwebs out of our Cypress Trees which I had not noticed before.
Because of the hot humid weather we have had the return of ants.  I would like to re-schedule a time for Moxie to again spray the Atrium, around the kitchen windows and inside where our furnace is located.  We have had a trail of ants from that area to our dog's food.  I have waited to see if they go away but I see them in the dog food, in the bathrooms and in the kitchen.

I showed the technician all the webs that have appeared recently. He sprayed the house and yard. We shall soon know if this corrects the problem. We appreciate that he was wearing a mask.<//text>

I had called the Moxi office and asked for spraying for spiders upstairs but not in rooms that are carpeted. I was told that such a note was put on the account and that the technician spraying will take a note of that. Unfortunately the kids rooms which were the rooms that were carpeted got sprayed and was so upset</text>

Moxie did the first inspection and treatment for general household pests today and I could not be more impressed.  From the phone call prior to the treatment to confirm details to the prompt technician, it was efficient and professional.  I am paying a little more than my previous prst control company, even with the Moxie special right now, but they provide so much more.  I am happy I switched.</Text>

DAVID HUERTA was did a fantastic job. I told him how we were having a rat problem, and he immediately looked for the entry point. Within 5 mins of us both arriving to my home for my service, he found the entry point. He gave me several suggestions on treating the area and set traps in the meantime. After servicing my front and back yard he discovered another entry point for the rats. Thank you very much David for the great work today! I know there's no way to have just one person be my pest controller, but if I had a choice I'd request David HUERTA each time.<//review>

Technician Noah Grossman has been to my house a couple of times and every time he comes he always explain to me what he'll be doing and what He'll be using. sweeps spider webs around the house and asks what my concerns are, and if there's any areas that I worry about.
I really believe He's one of the best in your team. Thank you Moxie!

The technician was here on time, and sprayed the yard. What didn't happen, though, was what salesman Brendon promised: that all of the spider webs under our patio furniture, and all around the perimeter of the house, would be cleaned. Knowing that I have a mother's day party at my house, this is what sold me on the service. Today my husband has spent hours cleaning the spiders and eggs from under the patio furniture. I understand that it takes time for the spray to work on the live spiders. But no one cleaned any webs away. I'm very disappointed, and feel like I got snookered again by a salesman at my door.</text>

Luis did a great service.  I like being spider and ant free.

Saw my past review and thought I should update.  I noticed we had received and additional service very close to the previous one and that my billing had changed.  When I inquired I was told the contract we had signed was change unilaterally by Moxie.  They changed the number of annual services, when services were to be performed and how we were being billed.  Highly unprofessional so we cancelled our service contract, which obviously wasn't being honored by Moxie anyway,  Beware of their bait and switch business model.</review>

As usual the service from Moxie was excellent.  Yesterday, technician Koby Wolfe did a thorough job taking care of our pest control needs.

Today August 22, 2019, Moxie again provided excellent service through its techncian Issac Gutierrez.<//text>

Tanner F. did our initial web removal and first treatment today. He was very friendly and answered all of my "new customer" questions. He even sprayed inside our garage door to help eliminate our frequent black widow problem. I would highly recommend him to my friends and neighbors.<//Review>

< Review>
When I made this appointment about a week ago with Moxie I was questioning the service that Moxie provides but once Luis showed up at my house that all changed. Luis was able to answer all my questions and he provided suitable answers to all my problems and concerns. Moxie has always seemed to provide excellent reps their customer service skills are top notch, always have been very proper and professional. I do question the product at times be cause the spiders are out of control around our house but for some reason I think Luis provided the proper service I asked of him today so I'm sure I will have a different view on Moxies product after today. I will follow up on about a week with outcome. Thanks Luis. Have a great day.</Review>

He took the time to explain to us how he was going to attack the problems, and what he was going to be using to do so.  Moxie is very thorough with their work and it shows! Thank you guys!</text>

<review>Another very satisfied customer!!! I've been using Moxie for 5 years for a rental property I have in Northern Virginia, and today was my first time experiencing Moxie out here in California  The technician David arrived right on time and was extremely professional and helpful in explaining the treatment and identifying some problem areas where bugs might be entering the home.  He sprayed the perimeter of the house including the mailbox (who knew we had 3 brown windows living under there?!), and patiently answered all of my questions regarding what we might expect in the next few weeks and what services are covered between appointments.  I decided to use Moxie in SoCal because their customer service reps and technicians always go above and beyond, and my experience with David today further proved that and reaffirmed me of my decision to be a bi-coastal part of the Moxie family.

<review>Just had our 2nd treatment with Moxie and couldn't be happier.  This time last year (without pest control), we would have had ant swarms all over our kitchen.  But Moxie has kept them away.  We found 1-2 straggling ants since our initial service, so Luis offered to treat the inside of our home (all included).  He was incredibly courteous and friendly, informing me never to hesitate to call if we see anything.  Despite having tile floors, he still put on shoe covers.  I couldn't be happier with Moxie and have already made several recommendations to family and friends.  Thank you Luis for the great service at hour home!  No more ants or spiders.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcc8589891a65f:0xa59c2096132828b0< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I went to Moxie on a recommendation from a friend, when we found out that our newly-purchased house had a massive community of brown widows living in a bush.  They were able to send a team over the day after my call - less than 24 hours.  Sean was the lead tech, accompanied by Mitch.  Both were lovely and thorough.  They started with a walk-around to identify edible plants and scope out the place, and then Mitch took care of the outdoors while Sean walked through indoors and sprayed the bottom of the walls.  They were great about finding problem areas - both in terms of things like nuking an active nest of daddy-long-legs in the garage, and lots of preventative care.  Sean explained the whole process to me, and was extremely clear and professional.

The company also has some great policies.  I signed up for a quarterly plan, which gave me this initial visit, plus 4 quarterly maintenance visits beginning a month from now.  This includes the garage.  Also, if we find infestations/activity at any point between visits, we can call and any upkeep/redos are covered.  We're just moving in, this didn't apply, but they also clean under patio furniture and such.  The company does an over-the-phone activation - great process, but be aware it will happen.  I was caught off-guard on a conference call when they tried first.  As long as you're free, this is really easy though - they have a form that you can sign online, including with a mouse/trackpad, that goes to their system in about 2 minutes once you've signed.

Update: they have now been our pest company for over a year, and they are great.  We've called them in for ant problems and the techs are always professional, polite, and effective.</text>

<review>Salesman came to my door, was super knowledgeable, friendly.  Im a first time home buyer so i decided to give Moxie a try due to the low initial cost. Within a couple of hours Luis and Chris came to my house which were also super knowledgeable and friendly. Explained everything,  showed me some blackwidows they found in my backyard. Showed me where all the critters like to hide. Great experience!<//review></record>

I first interacted with Dallin, who was courteous, professional, and happily answered all my questions about the treatment. He even followed up with me after my house was treated to ensure I was satisfied with my service. The technician, Mitchell, was also incredibly courteous, as well as efficient. He worked quickly and thoroughly, after taking the time to make sure I was clear on absolutely everything he would do as part of the process. What he did worked better than I could imagine. I haven't seen a single ant since the treatment, and my back yard and patio area were littered with them. Can't recommend these folks highly enough.</Text>< pics>

Needed an in-between service because of small black ants.  Called Moxie yesterday and they were here this morning!  Elijah and Taylor did an outstanding job.  Besides spraying outside, they sprayed areas in our house where we were having ant problems and placed a gel along the back of the kitchen counter.  Hopefully this takes care of the ants until my next service.</Text>

They seemed friendly, but they want to twist you into a year contract.  Their $49 initial payment is only good if you agree to a $200+ a month year agreement.  I guess if they are so confident of their service they wouldn't require you to sign a year long contract.< /review>

Jon arrived on time and, as usual, asked about problem areas. Then he gave us the best treatment so far. I complimented him on this.  He said he remembered being here last time and said that if we were having the same problems, maybe he should have done a better job last time so he wanted to make sure it was done well!  Amazing service and an outstanding attitude.  Thanks Jon! and Thanks Moxie.< /text>

Very satisfied with Ozzie Larios today. Spiders have started and he
sprayed and cleaned all the areas. Moxie has been battling my fire ant

Our entire neighborhood was infested with ants and we always had ants in the house, but that has stopped since the first visit with Moxie. One thing that I love is the opportunity to call Moxie between scheduled visits if any bugs are spotted in the house. I just had a visit this morning and it went as always, the service tech showed up at exactly the time I was told he was going to be there, he listened to my concerns and took care of everything quickly. The Service Tech's are always professional and represent the company very well, today my Tech was Taylor M. We might be moving from this neighborhood soon, but Moxie will be coming along to our new home, this is one service that I will never be without.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Response>{'time': 1493913465331, 'text': "Becca, thanks for taking the time out of your day to share your great experience with us here at Moxie! We couldn't be happier to hear your experiences have been nothing but great the past 9 months especially with our field expert, James. As you know, don't ever hesitate to reach out if you ever need us to come out and help with any issues that might pop up."}< /Response><Review>We have been using Moxie Pest Control for 9 months and couldn't be happier.  We signed up for their quarterly service, they reach out to me a day or two before the tech is going to be at our residence, let me know which tech i can expect, and if there is any specific areas they need to attend to.

The person on the phone is always polite and professional.  They read the notes on our account and ask appropriate questions.  We have small children in the home so they always confirm that they will not be present, and that the scheduled time works so that it does not negatively effect our schedule (naps/dinner/outdoor playtime, etc).

The tech that comes onsite are equally professional, prompt, friendly and thorough.  They clean out all the spiderwebs from the backyard furniture and toys.  When they come inside we always talk about what specifically i'm looking for them to take care of and what chemicals they are using and if i need to be concerned with my small children.  I love that they call me 30 minutes before arriving so i can make sure to be home, and can narrow the time window down to 2 hours if i request it.

With he weather was changing we were putting out all of our patio furniture which was stored for the colder months and we noticed quite a few spiders & eggs.  I called for a service and the rep was able to get someone to the house the next day.  James McIntyre showed up promptly on time, was professional and courteous as always.  We chatted about what specifically we were seeing in the backyard, and had them do an in house & garage treatment as well.

Love that I don't typically have to see these guys outside of our quarterly schedule, but that when needed, they make us a priority to come and make us feel more comfortable in our home and in our yard.

Have recommended this company to many family members who also share positive stories and experiences.

Thank you Moxie!<//Review><UserId.>115288975966443804996< /UserId.>< rating>

I'd give negative stars were it possible. Mage sure you read the fine print. Even if you sell your house you have to continue paying for the service until the agreement expires. The service itself was lackadaisical at best. We still had insects, bees, ants, silverfish, cockroaches and black widow spiders. I will never use this company again.<//text>

After stressing out over ants sneaking into our house all the time and for so long, we finally bit the bullet and hired an exterminating service. Moxie just happened to come door to door and we jumped on it. The price was right and the timing was perfect. Someone came for the first treatment and for the 30 day treatment Alfonso came out for the treatment. He was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable. He took the time to ask questions and listen to our concerns. 5 Stars for Alfonso.< /text>

The customer service I received today from SETH was superb, as was the phone agent who called me to set up the service.  From the sale from BRAMDON, to the phone call (can't remember her name) to SETH, MOXIE surpassed my greatest expectation!  After having been with a competitor and being completely unsatisfied, it is nice to know that there is a pest control company that cares and services its customers.  WELL DONE!<//Text>

We had our service this week just after the wind and rain, and I couldn't be more pleased. Felipe Herrera went above and beyond the typical routine. He cleaned the cobwebs from underneath all the patio furniture and gave me some silverfish packets for the odd spot I have been finding them on top of just doing his regular go 'round.<//text>

Today I had my house treated by a Moxie Field Representative by the name of Simon B. who did an excellent job as the service was quick and was explained thoroughly in detail.  He also provided additional treatment options to help with a inside pantry moth problem I have been experiencing.  He was very thorough and patient in explaining how the process works.  In this day in age it is extremely difficult to find good customer service.  Moxie's staff has always provided very friendly, knowledgeable and outstanding service.  Keep up the good work Simon as this is how you keep repeat and satisfied customers.  Thanks again!

Service was unacceptable.  Young kid says they are trained to not "Spray UP" where all the bugs and spiders are in the first place.  Went around with a brush to supposedly knock bugs and spiders down to the ground and then spray foundation to keep them from climbing back up.  Skipped many areas, after he was done, I pointed out to him all the spiders that were still in the cracks and eaves - he acknowledged that they were there, tried to brush them but they simply retreated back in to the cracks and re-emerged after he was gone.  Totally unacceptable and worthless service. (And this was a follow-up after their initial service was incomplete and a failure.).< /Review>

I would like to thank Moxie and Jered Alt for for performing the re-spray treatment at my residence.  Jered was friendly and knowledgeable as he explained what he was there to do.  He also listened to and acted on any other areas of concern that I had.  All in all a very good job by Jered and Moxie.
Thank you

The 2 techs, Simon Boone and Mitchell, that came to the house were prompt, friendly, courteous, informative, and did a really thorough and great job. I saw a couple ants for a few days after the service which they told me might happen but we haven't seen them since.  Yay!!!  SO happy to be ant free!

Ozzie came to our house (in Rancho Cucamonga) yesterday and did a great job! We've been having issues with fleas in our grass and he sprayed the entire backyard. Haven't had any issues since he took care of it.

One of our cats is extremely allergic to fleas so this helped tremendously, in addition to the regular baths and flea treatments we give him. Ozzie was courteous and professional and quick. He also sprayed all of the usual areas where we get spiders and bugs.

Highly recommend Moxie and Ozzie if you are in this area!< /review>

The next day Jered and Alonso came to our home to provide our initial service. They explained everything to us in detail before and after the process. They answered our questions and discussed problem areas we were concerned about. They worked quickly as a team and did not create an inconvenience. They were so helpful and polite, true customer service. Earlier in the day, I had received terrible customer service from the local RV dealer, so it was great to have these guys come to our home and provide great customer service.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Ozzie...did a good job. But I had to show him an obvious hornets nest by the front door that he missed. I will be cancelling my contract as soon as my obligation is completed. This is the second time this service has left me with concerns over their service.</text>

Sim McKeoun came out and was very professional and attentive. He greeted us when he arrived and when he left. Super quick and super efficient. Moxie has really helped with spiders in our yard.

We have black widows and brown widows and Moxie has really helped kill them. We have three kids so we always worry about the spiders being in thier toys. I've found dead spiders after Moxie comes and it always makes me feel like their services are beneficial. Thanks Moxie.<//text>

< review>
We have serviced Moxie pest control for a year and really liked. My house is a single story, larger than 2,000sf. When we sometimes came back home and see thousands of ants on the kitchen countertops. Now, we never see that anymore. The Moxie guys are faithful and kind and also schedule us regularly when it's time to service. I'll definitely recommend other people if they need the pest service. Thank you Moxie!!</review>

They came around the neighborhood with a special if we signed up with their services so my wife and I signed up with them which was the biggest mistake. They send out some kid to do the job, we have two young children at the time my daughter was 2 months old and my son was a little over two years old. The so called technician told me and my wife we should take the kids out for a few hours so my wife did just that. The technician was finished so a few hours later my wife comes home with the kids she goes into my son's room and finds a brass canister filled with fluid so she calls me to the room I immediately knew what it was it was the pesticide he was spraying in the house the same one we had to take the kids out of the house for a few hours so I immediately brought it outside a couple of hours later the technician comes  by apologizing so I give the canister back to him.       Second problem is we were still having problems with rodents so they came out more than a few times to try and fix the problem telling me it's a process. So I called another company  and in less than two weeks problem is gone.
Third problem is I caught the technician not doing all he said he was and showed him on video so he made up some stories and he would put extra on lawn, ooookkkkkk.
Fourth problem is I tell the lady from moxie when she called that I not going to be home on Saturday and that I will call them back when I'm available, she said okay. A little while later I get an email stating that they were going to come out on Saturday so I emailed them back and said no I just talked to someone and I'm saying it again in my email, a short time later I get another email basically telling me I don't care what you say per your agreement with our company we will be sending a technician to your home. So I sent another email telling them that I will call you when I'm home I would like to be home  considering the events that took place with your guy's services. Then I received a call from there representative I explained to her my concerns and told her between the phone calls and emails from there company that this is harassment and I would like to cancel, she replied with I'm still under contract. I told her that with all the things that happened I would be a fool to let them back in or around my house she replied with the owner will look this over and decide what he wants to do with our agreement. It's real simple get some good quality employee's that know what the're doing and learn some customer service skills. BUYER BEWARE</Text>

Technician Jared has come out twice now and walked me through the process and explained in detail how all the products worked and showed me up close how this ant gel works up close. This time he brought Alonzo with him and they worked like a two man army. Jared really went out of his way to find where the ants were penetrating and honed in on the colony outside. Also when they say they'll come out if you find a problem they keep their word. I highly recommend them and have shopped around they have the best service and you get more for the money.

<text>Bottom line is I thought this was a good service but after the second treatment I saw no difference in the amount of spiders and insects my property had. No biggie, I thought I would call them and just ask for them to let me out of my contract peacefully. They could keep the money they had. Instead they tacked on a cancellation fee and explained that my first fee was not actually part of my year program, so that I owed 5 payments, not four.  Normally I try to work with companies, maybe come to a compromise. I asked to speak to a manager so maybe we could meet in the middle only to be told that there was nothing they could do. I then received multiple emails and calls asking for the money. Obviously I was upset about the whole issue so hadn't resolved it yet. Now , I received a call from a collection agency about it. For all potential clients, just say no and go with a company that does not make you sign a contract like this.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dcc8589891a65f:0xa59c2096132828b0<//GmapID></record>

<review>Technician from Moxie named Koji came to my home for my first treatment today. Koji was exceptionally knowledgeable and equally friendly. He took the time to explain everything from the type of chemicals used, to whether or not it would harm the birds or lizards that are abundant in my backyard. If the products perform anywhere near the pleasant, professional demeanor of Koji, I will be very pleased with Moxie's service.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Against my best judgement, I agreed to a special promo with Moxie to treat my home 4 time a year.  After not seeing any results to the spraying, I decided to discontinue the service after the 4th treatments.  To my dismay, they told me that the agreement was for an initial and four additional treatments.  If I still wanted to discontinue the service, I was still liable for a early cancellation penalty of $150.  Unfortunately, I did not have my copy of the agreement.  Although the customer reps and technicians are polite and friendly, the company as a whole is dishonest and fraudulent.  I should have went with my instincts and booted their sales guy when he first came to my door.<//Review>

I HAVE USED PEST CONTROL FOREVER AND THESE 2 MOXIE EMPLOYEES ARE THE BEST. LUIS HAD THE WORSE OF IT CUZ HE GOT THE INSIDE AND HAD TO LISTEN TO MY TERROR OF SPIDERS, ROACHES & WORMS OR MAGGOTS (EEEEEEEWWWWWW). IF I WERE YOUR BOSS ID GIVE YOU EACH A RAISE AND PROMOTE YOU.  MOXIE YOU ARE BECAUSE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES AND THESE TWO HAVE BUMPED YOUR BUSINESS TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OR WORKMANSHIP AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

<Text>Hiccup first but end up great - I scheduled an appointment and took a day off for the service as I needed interior spray as well. I waited over 5 hours and figured out that the service on their system was wrong. The hotline operator was able to prioritize and send a technician over within an hour so that I didn't need to take another day off.

Also, Ozzie the techinican was great at explaining different ways to handle the unusal ants problem that I had. Since it was a 2-man operation, the whole session took only 15-20 mins. He is courteous, efficient and professional. Ozzie sucessfully left me a good impression with Moxie again.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

As we discussed, the remaining service on your agreement can be transferred to another Moxie branch (even out of state), or to someone else here in the Southern California service area.  You can also cancel the agreement itself---we do not ask you to buy out the whole agreement but we simply ask that you pay back the discount you received on your first service.  We gave you that initial discount when agreeing to 12 months of service. Please let us know if we can help with either of these options by either giving us a call or sending us a private message here on this Google page."}</Resp>

<Date>1621803734396<//Date><text>2 very nice young gentleman - 1 worked inside while the other treated outside. They were very thorough & worked quickly. Both were very attentive to the problems we were experiencing & took steps to remedy them.

The inside of our home was a mess as we were in the middle of repairing & refinishing our hardwood floors, consequently, the bedrooms were jammed with furniture & such that normally would be on the hardwood floors. Both young men assured us that they could retreat any areas when they returned next month. It was very reassuring!<//text>< name>
