My new favorite place!  Yum!  The vanilla latte with oat milk was awesome. Great local place with an incredible staff and superb selection.  My husband had the Peruvian blend and was equally impressed.  We found our place here!</Text>

I tried the honey bear latte and the honey bear cold brew. A bit more expensive because it's specialty coffee but I think worth it if you love coffee and having a nice treat that isn't too sweet :) the interiors are beautiful btw, would love to study here when covid restrictions are lifted. Would come again.

March/2021 Since my last review, this coffee place has become my favorite in Sacramento. Their drinks quality is just top notch in my opinion. Pachamama definitely wins top latte I've had so far. Their seasonal stuff is just so cute and I can't wait to continually get coffee here.

Updated review:
June/2021 Dine in is open again! It's still really nice but about $7 for a large latte. Idk if its because it is a seasonal summer menu item or not.<//Review><name>Helen Hoang</name><gmap_id>0x809ad0909b986695:0x3466102216f09c2c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great place with a variety of seasonal drinks such as a peppermint mocha. Food is also offered here from the traditional muffins to a few hot items. Plenty of seating inside and WiFi is available for use as well.

Friendly staff in a well lit space.</Review>< pics>

Great coffee from around the world direct from the farmers. My personal favorite is the Nicaraguan blend. They also have all the standard drinks you would expect such as lattes, mochas and so on; alone with some tasty pastry items. The shop itself is cozy and pleasant if you want to hang out and chat with friends or just sit back and study or read a book. The staff is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend you stop and give Pachamama a try. It's ☕ with a ♥!</Review>< Pictures>

This is the hot chocolate - yum!
I stopped buying Lattes several years ago from the big coffee chain . Had a latte today & it was the best !
This is a GREAT place for coffee.
The service was quick & the baristas super nice.</Text>

I'm a purist and love the simple yet comprehensive selection of pour over choices. However my uncle just ordered the dark roast house brewed coffee and it was served cold (unintentionally). So go the pour over route! This time I had the chai tea and it was amazing! So creamy and perfectly spiced, not too sweet! It's a bright cheery spot to linger as well.< /Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I love that Pachamama Is a co-op owned solely by the farmers that grow their beans. In fact, actually not in fact because I could very well be wrong here, but they are the ONLY farmer owned co-op coffee roaster in the United States. That said, this location is good but their menu slightly more limited than their other spot. I had the cortado which surprisingly was a bit on the bitter side. All in all though, this place is definitely one of the best places to get your coffee fix in the Sacramento area< /Text>< pics>

Very clean & modern, great coffee with several non-dairy milk options, excellent vegan donuts too! Outlets for plugging in a laptop. Pretty small space but wasn't busy, plenty of seating. View of J street. Prime East Sac location.</Text>

This is a lovely little coffee shop. The guy who helped us choose some beans and made our pour over was so friendly and knowledgeable. The coffee is very good, and not any more expensive than the other local shops. We bought the tin which actually made it a little cheaper. The fact that it's owned by the farmers is bonus points. This is absolutely my new favorite coffee shop and roaster.</Text>

<review>The coffee itself was good and I liked that they know what a cortado is, but I went in to work and the WiFi was terrible.  I had to go find a different spot to work.

Also, a dealbreaker for me on a place is if they have the system where you have to ask for the key to use the bathroom — especially when there are no paper towels for returning the key and opening the bathroom door after washing your hands.</review>< Date>

Excellent service. Seemed to really care about the customers getting something they loved. Coffee was well balanced and perfect temperature. Had plans to meet with a friend at another independent coffee shot near by, but after walking by this location and peeking in I liked the atmosphere much better at Pachamama. So we changed our plans went here instead. Very happy we did. I will be back for sure.< /Text>

The environment is very relaxing, you can tell the employees like working here and want you to feel comfortable. The guy who helped me had good suggestions for pastries and tea. The inside was very clean, as was the bathroom. I didn't try the coffee but I'm sure it is delicious too. I had the raspberry muffin (so good, had marzipan in it, very fresh and moist) and the black tea (strong, vibrant flavor and good temperature). I would recommend to anyone.<//Review>

I'm a semi-regular customer.  The coffee is top-notch and is why I go there, but the quiet atmosphere and big windows make it a great escape from the grind as well.</Text>

< Review>
Pachamama is the best coffee bar in Sacramento. Their roasts are superb, and their baristas are top notch.

Aside: If you're getting a pourover, try it without cream or sugar first, please.< /Review>

El Buen Cacao served me what was quite possibly the greatest milkshake of my life. The Ghost shake is made with their ghost pepper chocolate and had the perfect amount of spice, for my taste. My husband and I had to order a second one it was such a transcendental experience. I think they really shine in their drink selections here, but their individual chocolates were delicious, pure and beautiful. I tried the pistachio, peanut butter and fig. All supporting roles to the star; that beautiful chocolate. The staff was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They created a wonderful environment in which to enjoy a wonderful food experience. I cannot wait to go back.</text>

Hubby in need of coffee and spotted this place after eating pizza across the parking lot. As we got close realized that it is a chocolate place too. Ordered the Mexican Hot Chocolate - wow, was perfect. Finally had a couple chocolates too worth the price.< /Review>

We found the best little shop in town to get some delicious and high quality chocolate! We liked it so much, we came back the next day to try something else. My husband and I ordered a chocolate shake to share (they are small shakes, so it was perfect for us to share before dinner). We also got a piece of caramel and a haystack chocolate for after dinner. Everything was delicious, and more on the rich dark chocolate side. The next day, we shared their peanut butter fudge (we didn’t love it as much as the other items, because it wasn’t a traditional fudge).

If you really like them, they ship all over the country! Very progressive.<//text>

What a gem. I am going to crave the Mexican hot chocolate when we leave! Idyllwild in general does not have the highest level of cuisine, but this place really stands out as outstanding (I also love Ferro, which uses their chocolate in an amazing gluten-free chocolate cake!). I highly recommend the Mexican hot chocolate, and they have non-dairy milk options, including Oat milk! Very progressive of them in this beautiful mountain town! We will go here every day while we are in town! Great for anyone with gluten allergies or milk allergies!<//review>

Fantastic artisanal chocolate maker, incredible chocolate truffles, chocolate dipped fruit and fig & chocolate milkshakes topped by cacao nibs.  Lovely little nook in Idyllwild village.  And the nicest owners ever, feels like seeing family even though we only unfortunately make it in once a year when we travel in for a summer getaway.  A must stop when in Idyllwild.<//review>

What a wonderful treat and what a beautiful niche cafe.

Elizabet was incredible to talk to and guided me to just the perfect chocolate drink. What a treat. And with my beloved oat milk too!

Sit in the back and enjoy the scenery on the patio.

Well worth the visit.< /text>

WOW-

First - this little girl, literally knee-high, who looks like she could be a Disney character told me the store was closed and I couldn't go in. I asked her what time they closed and she said "30", being that it was 4:40, I assumed they closed. Then my wife tried to go in and she said "No, you can't go in there" we went in anyway and were met with the smell of chocolate... GOOD chocolate and a smiling, grown up version of the little girl we met outside.

After reviewing the menu - I really wanted to try the Violetta but didn't because I just had espresso - we ordered truffles and sampled some of their bars.  Without exaggeration, this is the best chocolate I've ever tasted. The truffle was perfect. All the big name brands don't hold a candle to these folks.  This place has ruined all other chocolates for me.

We'll be back for sure. Highly recommend.

AS FOR THE POSTS ABOUT THEM BEING RACIST:
The owner is American and his wife is Peruvian - and his precious little daughter is of color.

I don't believe the race card applies to these people.</review>

< Review>
Edit 2/3/21 - My last review was 5 yrs. ago & since then they have a new bigger location. The place is still good and they have added coffee drinks to their menu & are now selling merchandise with their store logo. They also have some art up for sell, even some from one of the owners.

From 5 yrs. ago: Exquisite! The setting is very inviting and peaceful and the chocolate...mmm...! Their chocolate ranges from sipping chocolate to different kinds of truffles, from Mexican hot chocolate to chocolate bars. The owners are kind and are great in spicing up their chocolate shop with different kinds of chocolate goodies.
My personal favorite is their sipping chocolate, but their truffles are delightful!

By the way, if you're an artist who loves chocolate, it's a great spot to be filled with delicious artisan chocolate and be inspired. Definitely, a great place to go to quench your chocolatey appetite.</Review>

<text>We visited this place for the first time today. The owners are so friendly and welcoming.  All the chocolate is dark chocolate (which, in my opinion, is the best chocolate!). It is the most delicious creamy chocolate I've ever had. For a drink I tried the Mexican hot chocolate iced (they had 4 non-dairy options which was awesome for me) the owner suggested the oat which was so good. The raspberry truffle was also to die for. We took home two chocolate bars, the raspberry and the ghost which I'm so looking forward to trying tonight. I highly recommend this place!< /text>< Pics>

The owner, Erik, was amazingly friendly and easy to talk to.  Their chocolate was superb.  My fiance and I each ordered hot chocolate and we shared a 80% nibs chocolate bar.  It was delicious and filling. El Buen Cacao starts with beans and with a little labor and patience creates chocolate goodies that will make you want to come back.  If you're a lover of chocolate, come here.  We were also happy to support a family-owned, local business that produces real products and has great customer service.<//Review>

I was really impressed.
They actually take a raw cacao bean and make dark chocolate.
The owner explained the whole process to me.
Very interesting stuff.
Of course I had to try it.
It was delicious of course.<//Text>

Get chocolate wasted in the perfection of love for the art of cacao. Homemade, roasted, shucked, ground and perfected into every chocolate dream one could wish for. The atmosphere is amazingly relaxing and positive.</Review>

I found this place last weekend and can't bring myself to leave it behind...best vacation spot for several reasons, good quality, pure, chocolate being the main draw. The owners are awsome and passionate about making the best quality chocolate possible. I'm a huge fan anyway so it was exciting to find a few new ways to enjoy my favorite treat. The chocolate sippers are to die for not to mention the non dairy options they have available. The best part is chocolate in its pure form is actually good for you, so why not have several more cups ;)</review>

The sipping chocolate is delicious!  We discovered El Buen Cacao the first day of our trip and went back each day until we headed home.  Of course we bought chocolate bars for the road!  Thank goodness we can get our fix online.<//Review>

Chocolate made from scratch! Try hot chocolate from melted chocolate bars. Smells so good in this little hidden shop! All the way at the back of the lane.< /text>

A wonderful, delicious chocolate haven! It's Idyllwild's best kept secret!  We have been two days in a row while on vacation and are still munching on our dark chocolate bar and sipping our Mexican iced chocolate! Organic, rich and worth every penny! We will be back every time we come to Idyllwild!</text>

Great place, nice people reasonable priced quality tires. Very helpful and friendly really a top place to buy tires.  I'll be a return customer next time I'm in need of tires and would have no problem telling my son to go here if he or my daughter in law need tires and they drive around my grand babies. Quick service too 😁<//Text>

<review>These guys are very laid-back and mellow, they don't try to sell you an entire set, just take care of what you need, showing you the prices in each category. If they don't have the brand you want in your size, they'll make a phone call and have it there in about a half an hour.</review>< user_name>

<text>Went to get 2 new tires for my car. The service and prices were GREAT! As a college student money is tight so the affordable prices were very much appreciated. The staff was polite, courteous, and friendly. They had me in and out really quick. I would recommend this to anyone, including family and friends.< /text>< Pictures>

Went in for a tire rotation with out an appointment. On this day they were able to take me right away and handle the rotation in a short time. The price was very reasonable. Very nice people. When it comes to getting my tires, they will be the first I look to.<//Review>

HORRIBLE!
HORRIBLE!
HORRIBLE!

The ONLY 1 there that does not try to cheat customers is ERIC!!!

Don't waste your time even talking to the obese, fat nasty a** slob female.

Her brother is there, too...The guy always standing around barking orders at everyone else.

Don't come here.

They charged me taxes on a USED TIRE!!!

So petty and filthy.

Save yourself a headache and avoid this sh**hole.

Everybody except Eric here is TRASH.

Straight FILTH.</Text>

I practically grew up running around this place as a kid & it has remained the same honest, reliable & quick service throughout the 23+ years I have been driving. You could not ask for better service mgr than Jon. He is genuine & cares about getting you back on the road safely and reasonably. I have recommended McMahan Tire to a lot of people over the years and eventually it comes up in conversation. And it is almost always the same experience. If you have loyalties to local business owners and believe in value, this is where you buy.
And the deli sandwiches @Tony's, next door, are well worth waiting & grabbing lunch while you're there.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><user_id>107089221162215178689<//user_id><review>They tried and COMPLETELY failed in their attempt to put on a rim protector called Alloygator. Jons explanation was that it was a 'pain in the butt' to put on. When I phoned  him less than a week later to say that the rim protector was 1/2 way off, he said that he was not surprised. How can he put something on and then be NOT surprised that it was not done correctly? He should have said he was TOTALLY surprised and reimbursed me for the cost of the rim protector.

To be fair, he did say that he would try again, but once it is attempted, I need a whole new rim protector. You can't just try to put the same one on again. Also, there was no charge for the install.

My beef is that if he could not do it, then he should have never tried. My other complaint is that when he said he was not surprised that it had already come off, then it seemed to me he knew before hand that he could not do the work properly.

Now I have 1/2 a rim protector sticking out and it looks horrible. I would not recommend this place for any unusual items. Just a tire store, nothing else.</review></record></dataset><record>

I took my boys and niece here and we had a blast.  The instructor helped us get things dialed in and we were sticking the target in no time.  The only critique I would give would be that sharper axes would be nice.  We had some good hits but they wouldn't stick.

Overall, we had a great time and will be going back as soon as we can.< /review>

< review>
My husband has wanted to come here for over a year and we finally got to last weekend. I booked us the 3 to 4 slot which was perfect cause we got the place to ourselves! It was nice and quiet with no one watching to see how bad I did hah.

We had a great time! The owner was nice and gave us tips on the throwing styles and axes. They’re supposed to get daggers in the next month or so. All in all a really fun experience. We’ll definitely be back!</review>

This was so much fun!!! Best experience for a first time Ax througher, simple and professional tutorial before you start your game. The introductions were clear and to the point, the employee went around several times to check on guests and even gave some very helpful tips to improve your accuracy. 2 different type of axes already come with the price and if you want a larger ax or a dagger, it's only a 5 dollar charge. The dagger was by far my favorite, but both add on's were much easier to use then the normal ones, in my opinion. 10 out of 10, would do again!< /Text>

I love this place. I try to come at least once a week. Great staff, facilities, and overall experience. I would recommend that if you are coming with a group that you call ahead to ensure that they can fit you in. It's so much fun that they always seem to have at least one station being used.
Also, from my research of ax-throwing places in L.A., Axe N Dagger is cheaper for a better experience.
They offer a military discount, I think a first responder one too, which is excellent for anybody coming from the base!
My final review is Axe N Dagger is a great place to go in the AV if you are looking for something fun and new to do!<//text>

This was our first time throwing axes and it was a lovely time! The staff were super friendly and helpful and had each of us sinking steel into the boards.

This would be great for a date or just to let off some steam.

They also offer a military and police discount.<//review>

My best friend and I got a chance to check out Axe N Dagger right when they opened. We had heard about an axe throwing place closer than LA and had to see it. Owners were very friendly and welcoming! They explained how the whole thing works and made sure we were comfortable with it all. Spent an hour perfecting my axe throws. We had a little contest too....(I won). Great atmosphere and vibe...and music! Will definitely be back. Maybe for my 21st birthday?</Text>

First time aex throwing and it was a blast the staff was super friendly and was very instructive on how to throw the axe different was. 10 out of 10 would recommend Axe N Dagger and the price was not expensive at all for an hour of throwing it was total worth it. Will for sure be back when in Lancaster again!!!!!</Text>

<review>This was a great way to spend an hour in Lancaster and a good deal, too!
I  went on a Thursday at 3:30 with my fiancé and we were the only people throwing in there. Ariana, the employee (owner maybe?) helping us, was friendly, personable, and--most importantly--very knowledgeable about how to help first-time axe throwers hit the board. She taught us four different throws to help us figure out which felt the most comfortable and then helped us adjust our footing to make sure the axe stuck in the wooden target after we got the power part down. I hit a few bullseyes, and my fiancé was hitting them constantly.
Anyone concerned about the safety of lobbing axes in a building need not worry: There are chained link barriers dividing each section so that you can't hit anything other than plywood. Cool water and picnic tables are also provided in case you need to take a short break.
Definitely would come back, maybe even for a party--it's one billion times better than bowling!< /review>< Pics>

I have had the pain constantly for about 2 years and It was affecting my work and my ability to exercise. At my first appointment with Dr.Caruthers he took the time to listen to me and talked me through what he thought would help and how he would do it. Before using Dr.Caruthers I had had a previous chiropractor who hurt my neck and I was, frankly, scared and soured on chiropractic care. I told Dr.Caruthers about my previous experience and he made me feel comfortable and explained what he was going to do physically before doing it.  He was professional and capable. I have a better range of movement in my hip now and the pain has much improved.< /Text></record>

Definitely a good business man. "I'll tell you what, I'll give you a free adjustment if you review me on google" was what he said during our first visit. Which is probably why he has so many 5 start reviews. He was put off that my insurance doesn't accept him and the fact that I only bought 1 groupon instead of multiple. Like, he gave a big scoff. Didn't even get the chance to tell him I could pay out of pocket, no problem. I write this after a few months after going because I thought the experience I had would probably be like all of them so I finally went to a different chiropractor and after the first exam, my hip is back to normal! Now the doctor says to come a few more times to prevent it from reoccurring. Now I can compare the two. When I went to this doctor all he did was a 1 second back crack for my hip issue.
The one I recently went to she cracked my upper back, lower back, and hip, the most important and beneficial one!
When I asked this doctor if he was going to do anything for my hip, he told me he doesn't have an x-ray machine so I would just have to come a few more times before finding the true issue.... the lady I went to recently had an x-ray machine but didn't need it.
I'm sorry, but you are running a scam and it's really sad to see When there are people who come to you with their pains.< /review>

I love coming here! Dr. Caruthers is personable and very skilled with his craft. I finally feel relief in my back for the first time in years. I also look forward starting my session with the hydro massage bed, it is so relaxing. I would highly recommend coming here, you won’t regret it!<//review>

Phenomenal service at the front desk. Wonderful experience with Dr. Caruthers.  He addressed all my previous issues, as well as present. My adjustment was BRILLIANT. I feel 100% better. My time on the Hydro-Massage bed was relaxing, the adjustment following was smooth and beautiful.  Looking forward to my next adjustment 💚<//text>

This was the best chiropractic appointment I've ever been to. In and out within 20 minutes. Worked on my problem areas. Dr. Timothy is a very funny a nice guy. He is very good at what he does. Walked out of the office feeling a lot better. I will definitely be back. Highly recommend!<//review>

<Review>Dr. Timothy is a great Chiropractor and funny. He made me feel right at home. It was my 1st time  ever going to a Chiropractic and the experience was great. The alignment I received and how great I felt after it was worth it. I’m definitely going back! I totally recommend you pay him a visit.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Dr Timothy is exceptional at his craft. He is running an office by himself and still meeting all needs and going above and beyond to provide quality service. Treatments are targeted, appropriate, and effective! Been having issues with neck and shoulder discomfort and visiting Dr Timothy has things moving in the right direction. Thank you and looking forward to continued visits when needed!< /Review>

<Review>Very accommodating and professional I called him for last minute schedule change to see if I can get in sooner and he was able to get me in at the new time. Very quick and precise with popping. I’m 24 and came in with tension in my upper back and neck as well as knots in my lower back that I have tried to get massaged out three times but failed. I felt immediate relief after he was done there was no pain at all. My back and neck feel great and this is the morning after and it still feels amazing. It was my first time going to a chiropractor and will definitely go to him again. Absolutely enjoyed the experience.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Dr. Carathers is a god send! I've had a reoccurring bodybuilding injury for the last 4 years in my lower back and as expected it popped up again after over doing it, combined with pregnancy. I literally could barely walk, when I went into his office on Monday evening and by Tuesday, I had incredible relief. I got a last minute appointment with him and it felt like a miracle. He knows his stuff! Thank you Doc! I'll be back and I'm sending everyone your way!</Review>

<review>I had really bad hip injury before I came here. There were days where my left hip hurt so badly that I barely was able squat down to tie my shoes. After the first session with Dr. Caruther, my hip and lower back felt so much better. I’ve been to other chiropractors before, and no one beats Dr. Caruther.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

We are so impressed by Dr. Tim Caruthers. My husband was able to schedule a same day appointment after 4pm on a weekday. He has had previous back and neck issues which took him out of commission for 6+ months. Previous Dr’s tried solving the problem with physical therapy and epidurals, but nothing was a long term solution.

His neck/back started flaring up on last week, we tried everything we could at home, eventually it was time for a professional.

He was quickly checked in and showed to the Dr. They discussed his previous history, his recent flair up, personal health, and how the Dr thought he could help. It was best help he’s ever received for his back.

He’s been to other chiropractors but none have compared to the level of service, knowledge, and tools Dr Caruthers used during his first visit!!

He is excited to go back and I’m looking forward to scheduling my first visit.

Not to mention TLC prices were so reasonable! Can’t recommend them enough!!<//text>

<Gmap_id>0x89c281e73edf8641:0x3d019569837f00cc< /Gmap_id><review>My husband and I are first time chiropractor patients.
My husband, playing baseball all his life and performing in metal bands as he head banged, needed some help!
For me, I've had 2 babies and injuries... my hips and neck have been wrong for a very long time.
As soon as we walked in and met Dr. Caruthers, automatically we were greeted with comfort, kindness, and one kick a** chiropractor.
He was very knowledgeable and continued to educate us along the way for each adjustment he did.
He made us laugh the whole time with his great sense of humor!
10/10 would recommend this Doctor and his practice.
Safe to say he now has reoccurring patients from us.
Looking forward to our next visit!< /review></record>

<review>I went to Dr. Tim didn't know what to expect by it being my first visit. My wife had brought a Groupon for this chiropractor visit. I must say that the receptionist was friendly and Dr. Tim was very professional and knowledgeable of his craft. I was experiencing some excruciating hip pain. After my visit I noticed a big difference in the pain level. I recommend that you give TLC Functional Wellness a visit you won't be disappointed.< /review>< rate>

<Name>stacey kearns</Name><text>Dr. Caruthers is an amazing Chiropractor and knows his field very well. I have gone to him for 5 different injuries. I have had back injuries from work and a few bad rear end car accidents.  Everytime I have gone to him I had an incredible experience and started to recover and get pain relief quickly from his professional services.  I had a very irregular schedule and he allowed me to come in at different times since it was hard for me to schedule an exact time every visit. His ability to work with my schedule was a huge plus and I was always seen quickly and he always answered any questions I had. Dr. Timothy Caruthers has also helped me with other helpful health information that not only makes sense but has helped me be strong and sickness free for the last 25 years of my life. I'm now 52 years old and can out perform guys at my work that are 20 years younger then me, with his advice and services I feel great all the time and have stayed fit and healthy.  Thank you so much Tim for your truly amazing skills and knowledge of the entire human body, because of you I feel great all the time.
I have had such great recovery after my accidents that I will always return to Dr. Caruthers if I ever injured again.
Thank you,

Dr. Caruthers is absolutely amazing, I've been a patient for years.  Just went back today after couple years (he fixed it last time!), pain in my hip flexor would take my breath away for the last two days. Two hours since the adjustment, I haven’t felt it a single time! He is absolutely incredible at what he does, there are no torture devices or funky contraptions. He’s real, genuine, funny and thorough. I trust him completely, even when it comes to my neck making crazy loud snaps. There is no one like him, super highly recommended.< /text>

<Review>I found Dr. Caruthers reviews made me very content that he’ll be able to fix my stiff neck. It was super amazing to hear all my bones crack back into place. He’s an easy going great personality kind of guy. Paid close attention to my issues and wrote them down for his notes. Nothing is more important than a sincere attentive Doctor who just wants to help you out feel better while you feeling comfortable too. I thank God for putting him in my path. I was able to sleep amazing and wake up refreshed. I’m praying he can help my insomnia issues for the long run. Overall, if you don’t try him out you’re definitely missing out!!!<//Review><name>Marcia<//name>< resp>

Dr. Caruthers and his staff are outstanding.  I have suffered with back, neck, knees and hip issues due to extensive, 20+ years of business travel.  I can always rely on their flexible scheduling to get me in when needed.
His knowledge of the human body is second to none!  I go in with pain and I leave with none.  My entire family sees him including my son who is an athlete and needs TLC in between tournaments.
The care provided is exceptional!< /Text>

Encourage everyone if you have pain in your vertebrae in the neck or anywhere in your back for a long time.
Come to this clinic, they are sophisticated and friendly people and above  all, Dr. Timothy has a great experience in this field.

<rating>5< /rating><Review>So yeah, I feel ahhhhhmazing! Clean establishment, friendly Doc., timely, and knowledgeable. And as a first time chiropractic patient, all of this was important to me to keep my nerves calm lol. He only cracked my focus area (I only had one), and I’m legit now moving in ways to “search” for that pain that was previously there, and can EVER SO SLIGHTLY feel where it may have been... but it’s totally not even worth mentioning or complaining about anymore. So it might by psychological 😅 🤷🏽‍♀️, but those issues are for another doctor lmao. But omg, I’m sold!!! I’ve been living with uncomfortable tightness in my lower back for MONTHSSSSSSS now, and not to feel it anymore makes me so happy 🙌🏾. I didn’t know what to expect initially, and thought I was going to get a full body adjustment. But I was informed that you only treat the problematic areas, otherwise you’ll develop issues that didn’t exist before. I definitely appreciated the helpful piece of information because I’m sure most newbies thought what I did. But thank you again!!!  I’ll definitely keep this apart of my self care routine, and will see you soon!</Review>< pictures>

<review>I had few visits here with Dr. Caruthers. He is not only  correct me with his hands and knees on my hips, back and neck. Also taught me a few tricks to correct my tennis elbows and weak knees so I can do it on my own. Most impressive thing was that he can spot my problems with one of his devices, it shows where are my hearted and flamed spots, then hands on right on it. I got a good deal and he let me to keep that deal for the future visits :) Thank you Dr. Timothy ( first name ), very much appreciated !!!</review><Rate>5</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

I found Dr. Caruthers reviews made me very content that he’ll be able to fix my stiff neck. It was super amazing to hear all my bones crack back into place. He’s an easy going great personality kind of guy. Paid close attention to my issues and wrote them down for his notes. Nothing is more important than a sincere attentive Doctor who just wants to help you out feel better while you feeling comfortable too. I thank God for putting him in my path. I was able to sleep amazing and wake up refreshed. I’m praying he can help my insomnia issues for the long run. Overall, if you don’t try him out you’re definitely missing out!!!< /Text>

Dr. Caruthers does an excellent job at adjusting back and making me feel comfortable. I went to see him because I had terrible migraines and yes I said “had.” I no longer suffer from the migraines. He adjusts my back from the back. I don’t have to be on my back and get the “back adjusted from the front.” That never works for me. I leave feeling great! Thank you Dr. Caruthers. I have recommended you to family and friends!</Text>

Dr. Caruthers and his staff are outstanding.  I have suffered with back, neck, knees and hip issues due to extensive, 20+ years of business travel.  I can always rely on their flexible scheduling to get me in when needed.
His knowledge of the human body is second to none!  I go in with pain and I leave with none.  My entire family sees him including my son who is an athlete and needs TLC in between tournaments.
The care provided is exceptional!<//text>

<Text>I was in extreme pain in my low back and twisted like a hunchback. The pain was shooting into my leg. I thought I might need surgery it hurt so bad. I researched Gonstead chiropractors and saw that Dr. Cariuthers was the best in San Diego. It took 2 visits and I am back to normal.
He even adjusted me at his house. The guy is awesome!!<//Text><Date>1550601583621< /Date>< UserId.>

<Text>I’ve been a very satisfied client at TLC Functional Wellness for several years.  I came here initially because Dr. Caruthers practices the Gonstead method, which sounded like the best approach for me.  I really appreciate both his competence and his philosophy – especially the fact that he doesn’t try to sell you a long series of treatments if one or a few are all you really need.  His office is comfortable and welcoming, and whenever I’ve called for an appointment, I’ve been seen quickly – usually the same day.  What a relief to have such excellent care available when I need it!  Highly recommended!</Text>< pics>

I have come to Dr. Tim Caruthers for about 20 years. I refer all my friends to him when they have back problems. He has helped me and my daughter with various issues and have resolved them quickly and well. One morning a number of years ago,  I woke up with something wrong with my back and even hunching over wasn't doing it for me. I came to him twice that day, the first adjustment in the morning and the second in the late afternoon. He told me that the first adjustment wouldn't take but to come back that afternoon and I did and was back in shape after the second adjustment. One time my jaw was out of alignment and he adjusted it back into place. And with my daughter, he recommended she get toe spacers because of how her toes were growing and the pain she was having. She still wears them years later and her toe spacing looks much better. He knows what he is doing.< /review>

Dr. Caruthers is the best chiropractor. I’ve been seeing him following a car accident for the last month. I feel even better than I did before the accident. I had pain radiating from my neck to my hip. With weekly adjustments I no longer have pain and the mobility in my neck is significantly better. The office staff at TLC wellness is attentive and answers questions efficiently. I’d recommend anyone to Dr. Caruthers! Thank you TLC wellness.<//Text>

I started doing laser-lipo and just recently tried a few Cryoskin sessions  and have had great results. Lost 4 inches so far.
Initial assessment with Dr. Caruthers was informative. Trish in the office is awesome too! Makes you feel comfortable and great technician on Cryoskin machine.
Both of them are knowledgeable,  easy to talk to.  I would recommend.</review>< gmapID>

Just went back today after couple years (he fixed it last time!), pain in my hip flexor would take my breath away for the last two days. Two hours since the adjustment, I haven’t felt it a single time! He is absolutely incredible at what he does, there are no torture devices or funky contraptions. He’s real, genuine, funny and thorough. I trust him completely, even when it comes to my neck making crazy loud snaps. There is no one like him, super highly recommended.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< review>
I have come to Dr. Tim Caruthers for about 20 years. I refer all my friends to him when they have back problems. He has helped me and my daughter with various issues and have resolved them quickly and well. One morning a number of years ago,  I woke up with something wrong with my back and even hunching over wasn't doing it for me. I came to him twice that day, the first adjustment in the morning and the second in the late afternoon. He told me that the first adjustment wouldn't take but to come back that afternoon and I did and was back in shape after the second adjustment. One time my jaw was out of alignment and he adjusted it back into place. And with my daughter, he recommended she get toe spacers because of how her toes were growing and the pain she was having. She still wears them years later and her toe spacing looks much better. He knows what he is doing.<//review>

<date>1580835063904< /date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Dr. Caruthers is an amazing Chiropractor and knows his field very well. I have gone to him for 5 different injuries. I have had back injuries from work and a few bad rear end car accidents.  Everytime I have gone to him I had an incredible experience and started to recover and get pain relief quickly from his professional services.  I had a very irregular schedule and he allowed me to come in at different times since it was hard for me to schedule an exact time every visit. His ability to work with my schedule was a huge plus and I was always seen quickly and he always answered any questions I had. Dr. Timothy Caruthers has also helped me with other helpful health information that not only makes sense but has helped me be strong and sickness free for the last 25 years of my life. I'm now 52 years old and can out perform guys at my work that are 20 years younger then me, with his advice and services I feel great all the time and have stayed fit and healthy.  Thank you so much Tim for your truly amazing skills and knowledge of the entire human body, because of you I feel great all the time.
I have had such great recovery after my accidents that I will always return to Dr. Caruthers if I ever injured again.
Thank you,

<text>I was in a lot of pain when I got out of bed in the morning, with hip pain.  I decided to return and see if he could help me with another adjustment.  Within 2-3 minutes I felt much better with ease and flexibility when I walked out of the office.  I have continued to go back for a couple more treatments and he thinks I’ll be good to go without returning.  For now at least.  I highly recommend him for any kind of problem one might encounter.  He knew exactly where the issue was located as soon as I described my symptoms.<//text><Gmap_id>0x89c281e73edf8641:0x3d019569837f00cc</Gmap_id>< response>

< Review>
Bought three chiropractor  visits  via groupon for my mother  as an early Christmas gift. Mom was a bit afraid to go as shes had a really  bad experience  with a chiropractor in the past. Needless  to say she really approves of Dr. Caruthers. When he adjusted her she felt no pain. In the car ride home she told me that her pain level was at a 9  before being adjusted( 9 being really  painful)but after the vist  it became  a level 2. I'm so happy I was able to help my mother and give her  this gift. Thank you so much Dr. Caruthers.< /Review>

I’ve started the Laser Lipo with Dr. Timothy Caruthers at TLC Functional Wellness. I can see results right away losing inches from my waist in addition to following a new lifestyle diet. I highly recommend this treatment to anyone who really want to lose inches and feel good at the same time.< /Review>

<review>I had a herniated disc at L4 and L5 and was recommended for surgery. I was referred to Dr. Caruthers by the Gonstead Seminars.

TLC provides a wide range of services from chiropractic to weight loss programs. Dr. Caruthers is the absolute best! He takes the time to personalize your treatment plans with your goals in mind - whether it be treatment for injuries, pain management, weight loss or all of the above. Dr. Caruthers can truly do it all. Highly recommend!<//review>

I was browing Groupon and looking for a new chiropractore to try out for an adjustment and found this place. It was kind of hard to find at first because it's a suite in a building, but once I found it, I was glad I did. Dr. Caruthers was quick, easy and painless. He was very personable and friendly, asked a few questions, then fixed me right up! I'm usually nervous about trying new places, but I felt at ease and welcomed in the TLC Funcitonal Wellness center.<//Review>

<text>I had sudden onset of pretty severe sciatica, I was in desperate need of a Chiropractor, thank goodness my insurance gave me Dr Caruthers as a recommended Dr because they had an available appointment that same day I called. Anne at the front desk was super helpful and Dr Caruthers is very personable and knows what he’s doing, he has helped me get back to my normal activities and feeling like myself again with his recommendations and expertise. They accept walk in appointments which is awesome and seem to be open to working with your schedule which is a blessing because I definitely have a hectic one! I would highly recommend seeing Dr Caruthers if you’re in need of a good Chiropractor!!<//text>< Pictures>

I’ve been a very satisfied client at TLC Functional Wellness for several years.  I came here initially because Dr. Caruthers practices the Gonstead method, which sounded like the best approach for me.  I really appreciate both his competence and his philosophy – especially the fact that he doesn’t try to sell you a long series of treatments if one or a few are all you really need.  His office is comfortable and welcoming, and whenever I’ve called for an appointment, I’ve been seen quickly – usually the same day.  What a relief to have such excellent care available when I need it!  Highly recommended!</text>

I can not praise Dr Caruthers enough! I have back issues that I’ve had for almost 5 years. I pretty much gave up with ever living with less pain until a friend referred me here. Dr Caruthers has done more for me in 6 months then Kaiser did in years. The staff is friendly and acomidating with my schedule and I always feel amazing when I walk out. I refer everyone I know to him!</Text>

I couldn’t be happier with my overall experience with TLC Wellness and Dr Caruthers. I found an ad on Facebook for a weight loss program and decided to look into it. I was frustrated with my weight gain, after a car accident years ago. I also needed a Chiropractor and this was a one stop shop. The office has everything you need under one roof! I used the red light therapy and the “jiggle” machine 3x per week. I committed to following a new healthy diet, with Dr Caruthers there to hold me accountable along the way. I also increased my physical activity by walking several times per week. This is not something that will happen over night. If you are ready to take your health seriously and commit to making changes, Dr Caruthers and his staff are there to help you make it happen! I can’t say enough about how thankful I am for taking that chance and working with Dr Caruthers ! I met my goal of losing 25lbs! I lost a total of 16.25” and went down two pant sizes!
Thank you Dr Caruthers for showing me a healthier way of living!</text>

Dr. Tim Caruthers has been helping me for years, I used to do alot of sports; soccer, football, baseball. When I got hurt, he helped me through that process. Going for regular adjustments can change your whole outlook, it's super rejuvinating. And now that I work in the shipyard as a shipfitter, the environment is very damaging, we're on our knees for hours and in tight spaces, doing crazy things. I cant even begin to tell you how much these adjustments help. My parents are in their 70's now and they get help from Tim too. Some doctors told them they had to get surgery, and Tim said "No, you dont need that", and proceeded to prove that they really didnt. Phenomenal!!

Thank you Tim!!<//review>

I had a badly herniated disc (3/8") and two adjacent bulging discs in my neck.  My neurosurgeon wanted to perform surgery.  Thank God I found Dr. Caruthers.  He "literally" straightened my neck out using decompression, and I only require occasional maintenance.  DON'T GO UNDER THE KNIFE until you have tried Dr. Caruthers.< /review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>I went to TLC Chiropractic for hip pain. I have had the pain constantly for about 2 years and It was affecting my work and my ability to exercise. At my first appointment with Dr.Caruthers he took the time to listen to me and talked me through what he thought would help and how he would do it. Before using Dr.Caruthers I had had a previous chiropractor who hurt my neck and I was, frankly, scared and soured on chiropractic care. I told Dr.Caruthers about my previous experience and he made me feel comfortable and explained what he was going to do physically before doing it.  He was professional and capable. I have a better range of movement in my hip now and the pain has much improved.< /review><userid>116043248200302003351<//userid><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>5</Rate><GmapID>0x89c281e73edf8641:0x3d019569837f00cc<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Definitely a good business man. "I'll tell you what, I'll give you a free adjustment if you review me on google" was what he said during our first visit. Which is probably why he has so many 5 start reviews. He was put off that my insurance doesn't accept him and the fact that I only bought 1 groupon instead of multiple. Like, he gave a big scoff. Didn't even get the chance to tell him I could pay out of pocket, no problem. I write this after a few months after going because I thought the experience I had would probably be like all of them so I finally went to a different chiropractor and after the first exam, my hip is back to normal! Now the doctor says to come a few more times to prevent it from reoccurring. Now I can compare the two. When I went to this doctor all he did was a 1 second back crack for my hip issue.
The one I recently went to she cracked my upper back, lower back, and hip, the most important and beneficial one!
When I asked this doctor if he was going to do anything for my hip, he told me he doesn't have an x-ray machine so I would just have to come a few more times before finding the true issue.... the lady I went to recently had an x-ray machine but didn't need it.
I'm sorry, but you are running a scam and it's really sad to see When there are people who come to you with their pains.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x89c281e73edf8641:0x3d019569837f00cc</gmapID></record>

Dr. Caruthers did my first chiropractic adjustment when I was 4 months old and has been adjusting me ever since. He is absolutely the best chiropractor and has helped me elevate pain from car accidents to workout injuries without over adjusting me. He takes the time to listen to what is bothering me at ever visit and is able to target what is causing the pain and fix it. I would recommend Dr. Caruthers and TLC Functional wellness to everyone.< /Review>

I love coming here! Dr. Caruthers is personable and very skilled with his craft. I finally feel relief in my back for the first time in years. I also look forward starting my session with the hydro massage bed, it is so relaxing. I would highly recommend coming here, you won’t regret it!< /text>

Phenomenal service at the front desk. Wonderful experience with Dr. Caruthers.  He addressed all my previous issues, as well as present. My adjustment was BRILLIANT. I feel 100% better. My time on the Hydro-Massage bed was relaxing, the adjustment following was smooth and beautiful.  Looking forward to my next adjustment 💚</text>

<Text>This was the best chiropractic appointment I've ever been to. In and out within 20 minutes. Worked on my problem areas. Dr. Timothy is a very funny a nice guy. He is very good at what he does. Walked out of the office feeling a lot better. I will definitely be back. Highly recommend!<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Dr. Timothy is a great Chiropractor and funny. He made me feel right at home. It was my 1st time  ever going to a Chiropractic and the experience was great. The alignment I received and how great I felt after it was worth it. I’m definitely going back! I totally recommend you pay him a visit.<//Review>< pictures>

Very accommodating and professional I called him for last minute schedule change to see if I can get in sooner and he was able to get me in at the new time. Very quick and precise with popping. I’m 24 and came in with tension in my upper back and neck as well as knots in my lower back that I have tried to get massaged out three times but failed. I felt immediate relief after he was done there was no pain at all. My back and neck feel great and this is the morning after and it still feels amazing. It was my first time going to a chiropractor and will definitely go to him again. Absolutely enjoyed the experience.< /Review>

Dr. Carathers is a god send! I've had a reoccurring bodybuilding injury for the last 4 years in my lower back and as expected it popped up again after over doing it, combined with pregnancy. I literally could barely walk, when I went into his office on Monday evening and by Tuesday, I had incredible relief. I got a last minute appointment with him and it felt like a miracle. He knows his stuff! Thank you Doc! I'll be back and I'm sending everyone your way!</review>

<Review>I had really bad hip injury before I came here. There were days where my left hip hurt so badly that I barely was able squat down to tie my shoes. After the first session with Dr. Caruther, my hip and lower back felt so much better. I’ve been to other chiropractors before, and no one beats Dr. Caruther.<//Review><GmapID>0x89c281e73edf8641:0x3d019569837f00cc</GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating><resp>None</resp>< name>

<rating>5< /rating><review>We are so impressed by Dr. Tim Caruthers. My husband was able to schedule a same day appointment after 4pm on a weekday. He has had previous back and neck issues which took him out of commission for 6+ months. Previous Dr’s tried solving the problem with physical therapy and epidurals, but nothing was a long term solution.

His neck/back started flaring up on last week, we tried everything we could at home, eventually it was time for a professional.

He was quickly checked in and showed to the Dr. They discussed his previous history, his recent flair up, personal health, and how the Dr thought he could help. It was best help he’s ever received for his back.

He’s been to other chiropractors but none have compared to the level of service, knowledge, and tools Dr Caruthers used during his first visit!!

He is excited to go back and I’m looking forward to scheduling my first visit.

Not to mention TLC prices were so reasonable! Can’t recommend them enough!!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My husband and I are first time chiropractor patients.
My husband, playing baseball all his life and performing in metal bands as he head banged, needed some help!
For me, I've had 2 babies and injuries... my hips and neck have been wrong for a very long time.
As soon as we walked in and met Dr. Caruthers, automatically we were greeted with comfort, kindness, and one kick a** chiropractor.
He was very knowledgeable and continued to educate us along the way for each adjustment he did.
He made us laugh the whole time with his great sense of humor!
10/10 would recommend this Doctor and his practice.
Safe to say he now has reoccurring patients from us.
Looking forward to our next visit!</review>

<review>I went to Dr. Tim didn't know what to expect by it being my first visit. My wife had brought a Groupon for this chiropractor visit. I must say that the receptionist was friendly and Dr. Tim was very professional and knowledgeable of his craft. I was experiencing some excruciating hip pain. After my visit I noticed a big difference in the pain level. I recommend that you give TLC Functional Wellness a visit you won't be disappointed.</review>< Pictures>

Dr. Caruthers is the best chiropractor. I’ve been seeing him following a car accident for the last month. I feel even better than I did before the accident. I had pain radiating from my neck to my hip. With weekly adjustments I no longer have pain and the mobility in my neck is significantly better. The office staff at TLC wellness is attentive and answers questions efficiently. I’d recommend anyone to Dr. Caruthers! Thank you TLC wellness.</text>

< Review>
Dr. Caruthers is an amazing Chiropractor and knows his field very well. I have gone to him for 5 different injuries. I have had back injuries from work and a few bad rear end car accidents.  Everytime I have gone to him I had an incredible experience and started to recover and get pain relief quickly from his professional services.  I had a very irregular schedule and he allowed me to come in at different times since it was hard for me to schedule an exact time every visit. His ability to work with my schedule was a huge plus and I was always seen quickly and he always answered any questions I had. Dr. Timothy Caruthers has also helped me with other helpful health information that not only makes sense but has helped me be strong and sickness free for the last 25 years of my life. I'm now 52 years old and can out perform guys at my work that are 20 years younger then me, with his advice and services I feel great all the time and have stayed fit and healthy.  Thank you so much Tim for your truly amazing skills and knowledge of the entire human body, because of you I feel great all the time.
I have had such great recovery after my accidents that I will always return to Dr. Caruthers if I ever injured again.
Thank you,
Stacey  Kearns</Review>

Dr. Caruthers is absolutely amazing, I've been a patient for years.  Just went back today after couple years (he fixed it last time!), pain in my hip flexor would take my breath away for the last two days. Two hours since the adjustment, I haven’t felt it a single time! He is absolutely incredible at what he does, there are no torture devices or funky contraptions. He’s real, genuine, funny and thorough. I trust him completely, even when it comes to my neck making crazy loud snaps. There is no one like him, super highly recommended.<//Text>

Come to this clinic, they are sophisticated and friendly people and above  all, Dr. Timothy has a great experience in this field.
I had a huge pain in my neck but now i feel more better. The pain was 10 from 10 now after the first adjustment became 3 from 10 and i have to more adjustments. Also, the recipient employee she is so friendly and helpful and sweet lady. God blesses</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>So yeah, I feel ahhhhhmazing! Clean establishment, friendly Doc., timely, and knowledgeable. And as a first time chiropractic patient, all of this was important to me to keep my nerves calm lol. He only cracked my focus area (I only had one), and I’m legit now moving in ways to “search” for that pain that was previously there, and can EVER SO SLIGHTLY feel where it may have been... but it’s totally not even worth mentioning or complaining about anymore. So it might by psychological 😅 🤷🏽‍♀️, but those issues are for another doctor lmao. But omg, I’m sold!!! I’ve been living with uncomfortable tightness in my lower back for MONTHSSSSSSS now, and not to feel it anymore makes me so happy 🙌🏾. I didn’t know what to expect initially, and thought I was going to get a full body adjustment. But I was informed that you only treat the problematic areas, otherwise you’ll develop issues that didn’t exist before. I definitely appreciated the helpful piece of information because I’m sure most newbies thought what I did. But thank you again!!!  I’ll definitely keep this apart of my self care routine, and will see you soon!<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I had few visits here with Dr. Caruthers. He is not only  correct me with his hands and knees on my hips, back and neck. Also taught me a few tricks to correct my tennis elbows and weak knees so I can do it on my own. Most impressive thing was that he can spot my problems with one of his devices, it shows where are my hearted and flamed spots, then hands on right on it. I got a good deal and he let me to keep that deal for the future visits :) Thank you Dr. Timothy ( first name ), very much appreciated !!!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Dr. Caruthers does an excellent job at adjusting back and making me feel comfortable. I went to see him because I had terrible migraines and yes I said “had.” I no longer suffer from the migraines. He adjusts my back from the back. I don’t have to be on my back and get the “back adjusted from the front.” That never works for me. I leave feeling great! Thank you Dr. Caruthers. I have recommended you to family and friends!</Text>< resp>

< Review>
Dr. Caruthers and his staff are outstanding.  I have suffered with back, neck, knees and hip issues due to extensive, 20+ years of business travel.  I can always rely on their flexible scheduling to get me in when needed.
His knowledge of the human body is second to none!  I go in with pain and I leave with none.  My entire family sees him including my son who is an athlete and needs TLC in between tournaments.
The care provided is exceptional!< /Review>

<Review>I was in extreme pain in my low back and twisted like a hunchback. The pain was shooting into my leg. I thought I might need surgery it hurt so bad. I researched Gonstead chiropractors and saw that Dr. Cariuthers was the best in San Diego. It took 2 visits and I am back to normal.
He even adjusted me at his house. The guy is awesome!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<text>I’ve been a very satisfied client at TLC Functional Wellness for several years.  I came here initially because Dr. Caruthers practices the Gonstead method, which sounded like the best approach for me.  I really appreciate both his competence and his philosophy – especially the fact that he doesn’t try to sell you a long series of treatments if one or a few are all you really need.  His office is comfortable and welcoming, and whenever I’ve called for an appointment, I’ve been seen quickly – usually the same day.  What a relief to have such excellent care available when I need it!  Highly recommended!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I had horrible neck pain and they took me in right away. After one session I already felt better that I didn't feel I needed to go again, but I did because I know maintenance is important and I'm glad I continued. Pain hasn't come back.< /Review>

I've been going to see Dr. Tim Caruthers for over 20 years, and I can't recommend him highly enough.  I had serious back problems all my adult life, and under his care they went away completely.  I subsequently joined his wellness program and lost 40 pounds, with significant health improvements to boot!  I have since recommended him to several friends.</text>

I have come to Dr. Tim Caruthers for about 20 years. I refer all my friends to him when they have back problems. He has helped me and my daughter with various issues and have resolved them quickly and well. One morning a number of years ago,  I woke up with something wrong with my back and even hunching over wasn't doing it for me. I came to him twice that day, the first adjustment in the morning and the second in the late afternoon. He told me that the first adjustment wouldn't take but to come back that afternoon and I did and was back in shape after the second adjustment. One time my jaw was out of alignment and he adjusted it back into place. And with my daughter, he recommended she get toe spacers because of how her toes were growing and the pain she was having. She still wears them years later and her toe spacing looks much better. He knows what he is doing.</Text>

I can not praise Dr Caruthers enough! I have back issues that I’ve had for almost 5 years. I pretty much gave up with ever living with less pain until a friend referred me here. Dr Caruthers has done more for me in 6 months then Kaiser did in years. The staff is friendly and acomidating with my schedule and I always feel amazing when I walk out. I refer everyone I know to him!< /Text>

What a Blessing to know Dr. Tim and his Healing Hands!  I am now 84 and for MANY years have experienced his Expert treatment for relief from lower back and hip pain. He saved me from hip surgery! Tim takes a genuine interest in each patient and I appreciate his sense of humor and
knowledge for my many questions on health issues.  He is never hurried and makes sure of my comfort before leaving. I look forward to seeing him knowing RELIEF from pain is on the way!! Barbara Stewart<//text>

If you’re looking for a good chiropractor this is the place to go.<//text><username>James Messina< /username>< Gmap_id>

Overall Great experience every visit.
I started doing laser-lipo and just recently tried a few Cryoskin sessions  and have had great results. Lost 4 inches so far.
Initial assessment with Dr. Caruthers was informative. Trish in the office is awesome too! Makes you feel comfortable and great technician on Cryoskin machine.
Both of them are knowledgeable,  easy to talk to.  I would recommend.<//review>

<review>Dr. Caruthers is absolutely amazing, I've been a patient for years.  Just went back today after couple years (he fixed it last time!), pain in my hip flexor would take my breath away for the last two days. Two hours since the adjustment, I haven’t felt it a single time! He is absolutely incredible at what he does, there are no torture devices or funky contraptions. He’s real, genuine, funny and thorough. I trust him completely, even when it comes to my neck making crazy loud snaps. There is no one like him, super highly recommended.< /review><username>Daniela Lefebvre<//username><Date>1572028298086< /Date><rate>5<//rate><gmapID>0x89c281e73edf8641:0x3d019569837f00cc</gmapID><UserId.>112594714052899577082<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Love the service  of Dr. Caruthers and his staff! They are genuinely concerned for my well-being and progress. Every visit starts with both a survey to document progress / status and a discussion of how I am feeling.< /Text>

I have come to Dr. Tim Caruthers for about 20 years. I refer all my friends to him when they have back problems. He has helped me and my daughter with various issues and have resolved them quickly and well. One morning a number of years ago,  I woke up with something wrong with my back and even hunching over wasn't doing it for me. I came to him twice that day, the first adjustment in the morning and the second in the late afternoon. He told me that the first adjustment wouldn't take but to come back that afternoon and I did and was back in shape after the second adjustment. One time my jaw was out of alignment and he adjusted it back into place. And with my daughter, he recommended she get toe spacers because of how her toes were growing and the pain she was having. She still wears them years later and her toe spacing looks much better. He knows what he is doing.<//review>

Dr. Caruthers is an amazing Chiropractor and knows his field very well. I have gone to him for 5 different injuries. I have had back injuries from work and a few bad rear end car accidents.  Everytime I have gone to him I had an incredible experience and started to recover and get pain relief quickly from his professional services.  I had a very irregular schedule and he allowed me to come in at different times since it was hard for me to schedule an exact time every visit. His ability to work with my schedule was a huge plus and I was always seen quickly and he always answered any questions I had. Dr. Timothy Caruthers has also helped me with other helpful health information that not only makes sense but has helped me be strong and sickness free for the last 25 years of my life. I'm now 52 years old and can out perform guys at my work that are 20 years younger then me, with his advice and services I feel great all the time and have stayed fit and healthy.  Thank you so much Tim for your truly amazing skills and knowledge of the entire human body, because of you I feel great all the time.
I have had such great recovery after my accidents that I will always return to Dr. Caruthers if I ever injured again.
Thank you,
Stacey  Kearns<//text>

I decided to return and see if he could help me with another adjustment.  Within 2-3 minutes I felt much better with ease and flexibility when I walked out of the office.  I have continued to go back for a couple more treatments and he thinks I’ll be good to go without returning.  For now at least.  I highly recommend him for any kind of problem one might encounter.  He knew exactly where the issue was located as soon as I described my symptoms.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1565809704408, 'text': 'I am happy we were able to get you out of your pain.'}< /Response>< gmapID>

I've been going to see Dr. Tim Caruthers for over 20 years, and I can't recommend him highly enough.  I had serious back problems all my adult life, and under his care they went away completely.  I subsequently joined his wellness program and lost 40 pounds, with significant health improvements to boot!  I have since recommended him to several friends.</Review>

< Review>
My family has been going to Tim since I was a baby! He is truly the best. From saving my dad from having to have back surgery, my mom being in so much back/neck pain from chemo, and myself with bad pains from being rear ended and sports injuries. Not to mention, when I was younger, he noticed my wrist not healing properly out of a cast, he quickly fixed it, BETTER than a cast would do. I refer everyone I know to Tim and always will. Thank you for helping all of us, Tim! You are the BEST, hands down.</Review>

Bought three chiropractor  visits  via groupon for my mother  as an early Christmas gift. Mom was a bit afraid to go as shes had a really  bad experience  with a chiropractor in the past. Needless  to say she really approves of Dr. Caruthers. When he adjusted her she felt no pain. In the car ride home she told me that her pain level was at a 9  before being adjusted( 9 being really  painful)but after the vist  it became  a level 2. I'm so happy I was able to help my mother and give her  this gift. Thank you so much Dr. Caruthers.< /text>

I’ve started the Laser Lipo with Dr. Timothy Caruthers at TLC Functional Wellness. I can see results right away losing inches from my waist in addition to following a new lifestyle diet. I highly recommend this treatment to anyone who really want to lose inches and feel good at the same time.</text>

I am so glad that I decided to do the laser lipo with TLC Functional Wellness. I feel better about myself, I have more energy and I have lost 30 pounds since doing laser lipo. Dr. Caurther’s  has been an amazing help in this process.  I just followed his instructions and the pounds melted off!! Trisha has always been great about getting me in for my appointments! Thank you Dr. Caurther’s and Trisha!!!</text>

I was in extreme pain in my low back and twisted like a hunchback. The pain was shooting into my leg. I thought I might need surgery it hurt so bad. I researched Gonstead chiropractors and saw that Dr. Cariuthers was the best in San Diego. It took 2 visits and I am back to normal.
He even adjusted me at his house. The guy is awesome!!< /review>

I was browing Groupon and looking for a new chiropractore to try out for an adjustment and found this place. It was kind of hard to find at first because it's a suite in a building, but once I found it, I was glad I did. Dr. Caruthers was quick, easy and painless. He was very personable and friendly, asked a few questions, then fixed me right up! I'm usually nervous about trying new places, but I felt at ease and welcomed in the TLC Funcitonal Wellness center.< /text>

I was in excruciating pain for a week because I had three ribs out of place and a pinched nerve in my back. The doctor prescribed me different pain meds to combat the pain and inflammation. For a week I was in excruciating pain without relief even from the meds. I was in Dr. Caruthers’s office for 15 minutes, and he not only found the problem, he fixed it. I was pain-free in 15 minutes after a week of chronic, debilitating pain. Thank you!!!!< /review>

I had sudden onset of pretty severe sciatica, I was in desperate need of a Chiropractor, thank goodness my insurance gave me Dr Caruthers as a recommended Dr because they had an available appointment that same day I called. Anne at the front desk was super helpful and Dr Caruthers is very personable and knows what he’s doing, he has helped me get back to my normal activities and feeling like myself again with his recommendations and expertise. They accept walk in appointments which is awesome and seem to be open to working with your schedule which is a blessing because I definitely have a hectic one! I would highly recommend seeing Dr Caruthers if you’re in need of a good Chiropractor!!</review>

I’ve been a very satisfied client at TLC Functional Wellness for several years.  I came here initially because Dr. Caruthers practices the Gonstead method, which sounded like the best approach for me.  I really appreciate both his competence and his philosophy – especially the fact that he doesn’t try to sell you a long series of treatments if one or a few are all you really need.  His office is comfortable and welcoming, and whenever I’ve called for an appointment, I’ve been seen quickly – usually the same day.  What a relief to have such excellent care available when I need it!  Highly recommended!< /review>

I can not praise Dr Caruthers enough! I have back issues that I’ve had for almost 5 years. I pretty much gave up with ever living with less pain until a friend referred me here. Dr Caruthers has done more for me in 6 months then Kaiser did in years. The staff is friendly and acomidating with my schedule and I always feel amazing when I walk out. I refer everyone I know to him!</Text>

<Review>I couldn’t be happier with my overall experience with TLC Wellness and Dr Caruthers. I found an ad on Facebook for a weight loss program and decided to look into it. I was frustrated with my weight gain, after a car accident years ago. I also needed a Chiropractor and this was a one stop shop. The office has everything you need under one roof! I used the red light therapy and the “jiggle” machine 3x per week. I committed to following a new healthy diet, with Dr Caruthers there to hold me accountable along the way. I also increased my physical activity by walking several times per week. This is not something that will happen over night. If you are ready to take your health seriously and commit to making changes, Dr Caruthers and his staff are there to help you make it happen! I can’t say enough about how thankful I am for taking that chance and working with Dr Caruthers ! I met my goal of losing 25lbs! I lost a total of 16.25” and went down two pant sizes!
Thank you Dr Caruthers for showing me a healthier way of living!< /Review>< GmapID>

<Review>Dr. Tim Caruthers has been helping me for years, I used to do alot of sports; soccer, football, baseball. When I got hurt, he helped me through that process. Going for regular adjustments can change your whole outlook, it's super rejuvinating. And now that I work in the shipyard as a shipfitter, the environment is very damaging, we're on our knees for hours and in tight spaces, doing crazy things. I cant even begin to tell you how much these adjustments help. My parents are in their 70's now and they get help from Tim too. Some doctors told them they had to get surgery, and Tim said "No, you dont need that", and proceeded to prove that they really didnt. Phenomenal!!

Thank you Tim!!</Review>< Pictures>

I had a badly herniated disc (3/8") and two adjacent bulging discs in my neck.  My neurosurgeon wanted to perform surgery.  Thank God I found Dr. Caruthers.  He "literally" straightened my neck out using decompression, and I only require occasional maintenance.  DON'T GO UNDER THE KNIFE until you have tried Dr. Caruthers.<//Review>

The store hours say 8am - 9pm
A worker kicked us out at 8:40pm saying to get our stuff and go to the front cause the store was CLOSED! I understand they wanna go home But the door clearly says open from 8am - 9pm so rude!</Review>

Wow, this store is so neat, has in organized and they have such beautiful clothes for women and children.  The men's clothes are nice too.  The shoes they have ar nice too. This store has more beautiful clothes then Walmart. The customer service is good here, considering they are busy at times, but they get to you.</review>

Couldn't find an item of right size because of the poor organization. I gave up looking for it after 10 minutes looking at almost every shelf within the department.</Review>

<review>Horrible management, awful customer service and no matter what, their system is always down and everything they have on sale doesn't scan as sale price so I have to fight with the manager to get my discounted price they are never apparently aware of!

<Review>Whoever said that this place has roaches is a liar or has the wrong laundry mat. The place is spotless! Maybe they brought in roaches with them.
Wonderful place and people. Very reasonable prices. They even help out the handicapped, going over and above what they have to do< /Review>< Pics>

This place is always clean, the employees are always making sure it stays clean. The machines always work, which is a big deal. The best time to come here is in the morning, not many people and his quiet and peaceful.<//Review>

"SPIC and SPAN" on going CLEAN, SAFE, EXCELENTLY MAINTAINED MACHINES, 3 DIFFERENT WASHER LOAD CHOICES, HUGE DRYERS THAT WORK OUTSTANDINGLY! The STAFF I've met have been very KIND, HELPFUL and PERSONABLE!
It may not be a FUN thing to do;  but having a CLEAN RESTROOM, cold DRINKS, hot COFFEE, THREE large screen TVS and PLENTY OF COMFORTABLE SEATING AVAILABLE as well as SEASONALLY appropriate decorations sure came together well to make me feel as though I was VERY WELCOME and my NEEDS AND EVEN POSSIBLE WANTS were more than WELL COVERED!
Thanks so much,
Terrilynn

<review>I use to come here often to do laundry but today 😡 I went there to wash clothes and it was final wash it just stop. It had F 17  I  assume it was an error or something went wrong, went to the management door and ring the door bell no one answer. I knocked the gate door no one answer so I thought maybe he or she’s doing something else that can’t hear me; I’ll just come back. Came back I didn’t see anyone; went and ring the door bell again waited for no more than 30 minutes. I hear coins being drop to the box where we exchange our bills into quartered. I literally waited by the door still no one came out of the office. Wasn’t going to wait any longer! It’s ridiculous! Will be washing my clothes elsewhere.<//review><response>None</response>< pics>

<Review>So happy I accidentally found this little place 🙂 It's clean and features all front loading machines. They have a handy sink for soap spills, a kids corner, a soap center in case you forget something, oh and did I mention it was clean 😎 I will definitely be back as long as we are in the area 😁<//Review>< pictures>

It is a very convenient and user friendly place if you need to wash all your comforters and covers sheets and heavy winter laundry, The Customer service is excellent,although understaffed but as its a DIY laundry service it couldn't be better than this.I loves the concept of the couch and reading books and magazine and enough room on one side for children aged 2 to 12 can place sit and have very good clean floorings and play things to keep them busy.The place is very well organized and it has detergents softners and 2 coin machine like a ATM..put 5$ and you get worth 5$ worth of quarters to do the laundry.they have medium washers and dryers and large(as above).Very safe and staff lady is very helpful and cleans each one with alot of hardwork to keep everything clean.i definitely recommend anyone with ( afore mentioned laundry type load) or 2 to 3 weeks of laundry for families to go there.Everyone is very respectful and even other users help you if you forgot your detergent and softener and whitening the actually let you borrow there's if you don't have money to buy it there.One thing it lacks is you cannot take all the heavy dirty or folded cleaned laundry from and to the car.i shall be grateful if you can do that for loyal customers and tag them with assigned numbers for each user and name for return back after you take the laundry inside and outside to return the trolley.</Text>

<Review>Two 80 lbs loaders which I love, but one's out of order. Lots of machines, decently clean facility. I'd give four stars but I'm giving two because the restroom is "no longer available to customers", due to misuse... I'm guessing that means that people who aren't customers are coming in and using it. There are other ways to deal with that. If there was at least a sink for hand washing I would still give it a much better rating.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I had checked the place out before going in there, to do laundry.. I really really enjoyed the experience !!!  they have flat screen TVs, bathrooms, fans all over the place..very well cared for.. the lady that was a manager, was answering peoples questions and helping out the customers...very enjoyable experience, I just found my new laundromat, to do my comforters & very large loads . I will definitely go back 🤣❤️🙏🏼</Text>

This place is under new management and the changes are huge! Three big screen TVs, FREE WI-FI!!, a clean restroom available to customers, air conditioning and fans,  leather couches, a kid corner with toys, kiddie chairs and books,  ice cold soda machine, a working soap vending machine and OH! The place is so much cleaner!!
No more solicitors harassing you while you wash, no more filthy..well, everything...
Go check it out! It's a great place to do your wash now!!!< /review>

Advertised as 80 cents a load, however you must choose between specific weight in laundry so the cheapest wash is, I think $4. I feel they're advertisement is misleading. The machines work pretty well, they seem to be well maintained, but because of the pricing I will not be returning. Also, when I was there, their air conditioning was not working/running.</Review>

I like coming to this place when I lived in Merced. But the only thing I didn't like was being rushed during late afternoon. The Asian people liked to sweep around you even though you were using the equipment. The place is under new owners and are way nicer.< /text>

<text>Advertising says as cheap as 80 cents a load. that does not make any sense to me. they have different size machines. they are divided by weight and cost. oh and if you are trying to go in to do your laundry by 7pm, they will start to rush you to get your clothes out and remind you about the time limit. THAT WAS IRRITATING. so let me break it down:

-Bad customer service
-Solicitors at the entrance
-Solicitors INSIDE the building.
-dirty entrance
-confusing advertising
-Bathroom is available upon REQUEST
-Smokers at the entrance stink up the whole building
-Laundry carts are breaking down.

the list goes on and on. I get that Merced is a town and all, but COME ON!!! at least have the decency to step up your game!! IT IS SO OUT DATED!!<//text>< user>

I'm someone who's been in this town,county & community for  over 40 years along with being disabled veteran. I will say that this is one of the best laundromats who's staff is t rained to keep the the place in tact. Holiday decorations.. on site attendant.  Wonderful..however I heed anyone of color to beware because I was discriminated by one staff member. I have a medical condition and he refused me to go to the restroom when I was literally in tears..he then stalked my every move and made false accusations that I was trying to be a trouble make since he was upset that months prior the owner offered me one month of free  washing. This being because another attendant refused me to wash at 8:10 and I argued (along with 3 other people who  were washing that I was not in violation of the time) ..this was crazy ..I mean something was truly not in sync with this man.

This recent one is caucasian drives a huge white F250(or some model close to it) and works primarily evening who harrassed me. It was devastating ..very devastating.

I can't wait for this new landromat to open on Loughborough by 7-11. It may not possess the visual ammenites & space like this one whoever after what I experienced...it's all about the service and how I"m treated as a person..a woman..a black woman & a black disabled veteran woman.

I will never again stand for that type of treatment and I can't believe how the owner and day attendant Debbie condoned & excused what I endured.

Maybe they're all related I don't know whoever it was very devastating<//review>

First of all I love this place. Service is fast food is excellent. I come here whenever my daughter has appointments down the hill which is quite often. We always get some pho I try a new kind almost every time. I've had the chicken curry so good mouthwatering. I get spring rolls with every purchase because the peanut sauce compliments the rolls so well. This place is a hidden gem and I'm so glad I found it. Me and my family come here just to have a fulfilling enjoyable meal made with comfort. 10 stars everytime.</Text>

<Text>This is the only place I like to order Pho. Always delicious. I love their sandwiches too. They have a wide open restaurant with walls that are actually windows that roll up so it’s like you’re sitting outside. Great place to eat and people watch</Text>< Pics>

I've only tried the filet mignon pho, the chicken, and their tofu sandwich. I was 100% satisfied with each one. the broth if nice and clear. what I mean by this, is that it doesn't taste fatty or greasy like at some other places I've tried. the beef was good and tender with little to no nerve/fat pieces and the same goes for the chicken. the sandwich bread was toasty, crunchy and the tofu wasn't too soft. good place to get food.<//Review>

This place out of all the pho places anywhere in the I.E and Pomona, is hands down my favorite. It’s authentic, it’s delicious, and I may have teared up when they finally opened after choosing to take safety precautions during COVID and close. But there open now! (pssst, go try it, everything on the menu is good)<//review>

Wonderful improvement from previous owners. They just recently opened in November 2016 and have so far been succeeding in their business. They inherited the place from a previous family that took poor care of the business and struggled the first month to convince old patrons to come back to the business (i'll admit even I was hesitant, knowing the condition it was previously in), but this new family has done a great job at turning the place around and are clean, not to mention the food is great.

My favorites here are:
Spring Rolls, Chicken Sandwich, the Vermicelli with chicken and eggroll, and their Shrimp or Seafood Pho.< /Text>

<text>Great restaurant! I ordered the pork with broken rice and it was amazing, and a really large portion! I couldn’t finish it but I genuinely wanted to. My boyfriend got the house special and ended up with some things he wouldn’t have normally ordered, but he ended up really enjoying his meal. Highly recommend this restaurant! The only thing I didn’t like was the Vietnamese iced coffee, but that’s only because I personally thought it was too sweet.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Food is good. But service was not as good. We were left unattended a lot and the place wasn't busy. We'll ask for stuff and they'll forget. One of the workers went outside to smoke and all the smoke went to us since the doors were wide open. Did not enjoy the second hand smoke since I had my little boy with me. Will not be coming back< /text>

The food was.. .not bad. The service was horrible. Waited 40 minutes for the check. This place would be awesome if the service was there. With the wait staff staring at me I couldn't get them to cone over. I will never be returned and sorry I came in to begin with. What a waste of time. Do not come here unless you want to be ignored.<//Review>

<Review>Ordered Pho to go, opened my broth to check it while in store and there was a FLY FLOATING IN IT. How do you miss this???? No apology was given, they brought me another broth with little black pieces floating it in it. NO APOLOGY. NO OFFER TO REFUND MONEY. NO GESTURE MADE TO MAKE UP FOR THE DISGUSTING OVERSIGHT.

This place is casual yet modern and way better ambient compare to other Vietnamese restaurant.  Very clean.

Good for power lunch and bringing your date.

Update:  Owners are always nice and remember my orders, #6, #16 and beer.  To compliment my meal, I usually order ice coffee.  Try it,  it's one of the best.

Thanks for tasty food and great service!</review>

The atmosphere is very low key and quiet, especially on the Wednesday night I chose to go on! But the food is impeccable - the spring rolls were hearty and the shrimp were large. The PHO THOUGH - I had the combination and with hoisin sauce, it was absolutely mouthwatering. The meat was tender and savory, and the noodles were cooked to perfection. And the avocado smoothie I had was the icing on the cake - rich, creamy, and decadent! Definitely have to come back just for that.</text>

Food is great, the look and cleanliness of the place also looks great. They normally are pretty quick with orders, but also love that you can call ahead for your lunch. Only improvement the place needs is more smiles from the female owner (normally the cashier). The other female waitress on the other hand is very friendly and nice. Have already been here about 100 times since they opened in 3 months ago.</text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I LOVE the food!!!! It's deliocus and it's cheap for a big bowl of pho compared to other resuturants that I have been.
Although I will say that the man that works there taking orders, can sometimes be rude by ignoring you when you need/want something. I don't know if he was ignoring me or didn't hear me 100% cause I did spoke loud and clear "excuse me" cause I wanted more chopped lemons and he didn't turn around until I waited for like 1 min when he was close by attending the other table next to me.
The first time I went he was polite and everything was great but the second time not really. I don't know what happened.< /text>< Pics>

Surprisingly good! When this place was still Pho Vi you could expect to get some decent pho, but Pho Vina has upped the game! It is very good.

Service still sucks, that will likely never change. If you like good service go to Pho Ha. If you don't care whether the service is good or not, this is a very good option.< /review>

The food was a bit too oily and spicy for me. Usually, I can handle spicy but I guess this place proved me wrong. On the positive side, they give generous portions and their Thai iced coffee was one of the best I've had in a while.< /review>

The crabmeat and shrimp pho soup was tough shrimp, and imitation crab meat and the shrimp spring rolls we're mostly lettuce. Server was kind of rude too, but it's redemption was the busser. The only accommodating person there.< /text>

A nice find in the Pomona Downtown area.  We had just returned from 2 weeks in VN and I found this to be a very good bowl of Pho.  Great space, light and airy.  Very Clean.  Busy at lunch time.  Very nice owners - "Nha Trang Nice"!<//Text>

<Text>This place was billed as "vegetarian friendly" but, despite having over 100 dishes on the menu, only one of them is actually non-meat. The dish in question - a vegetable soup - was perfectly fine, but the lack of choice was disappointing.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>the owner of this place think he's back in vietnam. he treats his own people very low. 1 day I was outside waiting for my friend to order some food. I heard this out loud sounds. coming out from the restaurant . and it was the owner he think he was back in veitnam.now I'm sitting down with his arms around chest. looking and acting like a king from some so far country. I told him to lower his voice. I told him I am vietnam veteran you need to lower your voice you are in U.S.A. Not in vietnam . He taught it was funning. So I left. And will not come back to this joint.<//Review>< Pictures>

My favorite pho spot since 2016. Fair portions for a reasonable price. Always delicious, I’m happy to say I travel from out of town to eat here. Service is fast and friendly. When I eat vegetarian, my go-to is the tofu pho (19). Recommend it to all vegan/veggie friends.</Text>

This place has a great selection and most of the staff are super nice. But beware of Dylan, the assistant manager.

So check this: After buying some expensive slab, I go back to pick out the backsplash tile. I was sent to Dylan, who has his own office by the slab yard, to ring me up. I tell him I have a contractor's discount, told him my GC's name, and he nods saying he thinks he knows the guy.

So Dylan is calculating away and when he presents the final bill, I ask if the discount had been applied. Dylan actually says, "I got you, don't worry" and almost winks at me. I handed over my credit card, took the bill home and looked closer. Then I called the store again, asked how much the tile was that I chose and sure enough, Dylan applied no GC discount. I paid retail.

I call Dylan again and said, hey, mistake made. 'Oh, no, don't worry. So sorry. Let me see..." then Dylan tells me to come back for a $59 (and change) refund.

A few weeks later, I'm by the place, stop in and find Dylan at his desk. He kinda/sorta remembers, looks it up and says, "Oh yeah, you get a $22 refund." I reminded him that he told me $59.

Long story short, this guy lied to my face twice in one sentence trying to explain the price difference. He took as long as possible and when all was said and done, I walked out with the $59 refund.

It made me wonder if the owners and managers know this guy is stealing from their customers, boldly lying to them, cheating them out of pennies. But hey, you add up a lot of pennies and you get real money. So maybe that's what the Arizona Tile owners want? Hard to tell. One thing I do know for a fact is that Dylan is a liar, cheat and thief.</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I have been to many Tile show rooms, this place is a disaster. It’s very unprofessional. My first impression when I entered the showroom was very disappointing. There was a bunch of women who worked there running around a empty showroom talking, laughing about their personal lives, including a manager. They were eating and drinking with food all over the front.

I had to walk to the back to place an order and waited quite awhile to get service. The male representative was late and there was a line. A smile or greeting would be nice. None of the representatives or store manager was smiling. They talk to each other behind the counter about personal matters instead of handling business professionally.

This place is a mess! They need new management with positive attitudes. I will never come back here again. I received better professional service at Bedrosians right around the corner.
**************************************************

Follow up to response by “owner”. I never received a response from you. You don’t have my contact information.

I did get the right place of business. Arizona Tile of Palm Desert!

If you read through your comments many people complain about the customer service.

And yes watch your cameras. I’m sure this happens often. Another time I came here girls at the front were taking pictures of themselves. Including a manager.

It’s an unprofessional place. Like I said Bedrosians around the corner is way more customer service based and professional then Arizona tile, in Palm Desert.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1595602565102, 'text': 'While we reached out to you, to learn more about your experience, we never received a response.

Great selection,  but found the slab room a little overwhelming. So many choices. Granite, marble and quartz. Brought home 4 quartz countertop samples. Now the decision time.< /Text>

<Review>Angela Daley was a dear in helping us with the return of the tile our tile men overestimated we would need.  After they hemmed and hawed telling us they didn't know if the store would take it back because it was special ordered we discovered the receipt says 30 day return policy and we got it into Arizona just in time to receive a $350 return!</Review><resp>None< /resp><pics>None< /pics><rating>5</rating><user_id>110793614030305412829< /user_id>< gmapID>

This place has a large selection of slabs. Unfortunately, the personnel show very little interest in helping you find what you need. Disappointing!</review>

Angela and the team are Arizona Tile are top notch.
They are the reason that we won't go anywhere else. Whenever we send a customer in, we know that they will be taken care of, every time!

Thanks AZT!<//review>

Staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful.  Candace Polito has been very helpful in assisting us in our material selections for four projects in our remodel.  The order desk is efficient and helpful.  All in all, a very pleasant experience, refreshing to work with competent, professional people.<//review>

<Review>We arrived about 9:20pm and they stop seating at 9:30pm, the waitress on duty was welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable and was not at all rude when we were still there past closing time.  We received our food promptly and was made currectly. When we left all of the visible staff wished us a nice evening.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Went there for breakfast. To celebrate my birthday.
I got sat down right away. Breakfast was hot and delicious.  Everything was good but  The waitress was a little distracted talking to her coworker.  All I wanted was a refill and the check.  She made it up by giving me a drink to go. =.]  Overall  happy< /Review>< rating>

I was saddened when they boarded this location up once the pandemic hit. Not a lot of fast food spots in dhs, take out getting home to a cold meal is redonkulous. As an essential worker I had to support my local business and finally dine in locally at a well trusted establishment.<//Review>

<text>Typical Denny's.... somewhat slow to get seated... but still under 5 minutes.   Standard Denny's menu.   Food nicely prepared,  although they gave my daughter a cheeseburger instead of the plain burger requested,  so a failure from her perspective... she would not eat it even after we're scraped off the cheeze.   It was late,  so didn't bother with reorder.  Minus 1 star.< /text>< pics>

Really,  the best food and service I have had from any Denny's location. Their cooks are real perfectionists.< /Text>< rating>

These guys always take care of me. The pancakes, 2 giant pieces that are like fluffy cake, for 2$?! Cant beat it. They're so good. I save them for up to 2 days and they're STILL fresh and delicious AF. They're so nice too. Ans they're consistent too. Like everytime I go, the pancakes are amazing. The one in thousand palms was a not so great experience. This location is consistent and has qualify!<//Review>

Stopped at this lovely Denny's on our way from California to Arizona on Thanksgiving for breakfast.  Patty, our server, was very cheerful, despite being away from her family. Conveniently located off the I-10 Freeway.< /Text>

<Review>Great service. Great food. Great prices. Went there for the special super slam, with drinks and a side of toast which was awesome! At least on a Sunday morning at 8:30am, all of the above and it wasn't crowded; we got our warm food within 5 minutes of ordering! Take advantage of the special Super Slam offer (just over 6 bucks with 2 hotcakes, 2 pieces each of sausage and bacon, hashbrowns and 2 eggs!),you can't beat it!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80db18d8090e1677:0xcfb274de37dee5d1<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>It was a simple in and out visit to a  but I was really happy with the way the Tuscan Chicken sandwich was cooked chicken was moist and big piece and also the seasoned fries warm and crispy. We were a Denny's this morning in another city and we received all over cooked food burnt toast , pancakes and eggs. It was like the cook their was running the stoves high and pulling to late. It was nice to come here tonight and have everything cook to satisfactory. Bravo Palm Springs Denny's night crew< /Text>< Rating>

Reliable and convenient! We enjoy Denny's while traveling since they can be counted on for a good meal. Their skillet breakfasts and patty melts are consistently good.< /review>

Connie was our server and was excellent. Unfortunately my dates food had a hair. Secondly the hostess disappeared. We waited for about 15 minutes on the hostess while another couple waited the same amount of time to be seated.<//review>

Our waitress was SO nice! Too bad everything else missed the mark. I will never go back. My coffee cup had lipstick on it. My water glass had old tomato juice on the rim. My silverware was dirty. The food was cold. The bathrooms were surprisingly clean. We visited on Jan 14th around 8am. Will not be back. Good luck to the waitress!< /review>

They're understaffed and the "manager" we've dealt with the last few visits doesn't work half as hard as the waitresses and servers. They work so hard... I love these women, both middle aged, one Hispanic and the other African American... they are my and my families favorite people there. Hard working and clean.</Review>

I honestly don't know why they received such a low score. The few times I've gone there, we've had a great experience! Great customer service, great portions of food, clean and the food was delicious! The chefs are so hard working! We noticed there was 1 chef a couple times and they were non stop trying to feed everyone there! The hostess is AWESOME!! So nice and friendly and received us with a huge smile! Our waiters have all been great as well. No complaints. Great atmosphere!<//text>

I enjoy all Denny's restarauntes. But never fails. They always forget something this time our pancakes. Though our waitress was polite and excused herself for forgetting she did accommodate our seevice to our liking. Bathrooms were neat. The floors were clean. And tables were quickly cleaned up. The pricing was good.<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>My experience in this place was not good. My family and I went to have lunch and the attendant forgot the entree we order, even asking for that twice. Instead, she brought things that we did not asked for. It also took too long for the food to arrive.  Usualy, they remove the plates when we are done, not in this restaurant. They showed no attention to the customers.  I do not recommend this place.</Review><gmapID>0x80db18d8090e1677:0xcfb274de37dee5d1< /gmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< Name>

The heavy Mexican lady at the entry barely acknowledged us. Told us to sit wherever we wanted and we had asked for a high chair for our one year old and she told us no problems you'll get it right away so we're over at our table and first of all it's sticky all over the seat and table top there were no clear door clean tables really anywhere near and after the other waitress comes over and wipes everything down for us we're sitting there waiting for a high chair and the lady at the front it was supposed to get it it's over there sitting playing games on her phone and then goes to the back and grabs a plate of food and is sitting there chalon down and playing around on her phone never acknowledged us again or brought us our chair my wife had to get up and go find one and get it herself and bring over the food was not nearly as good as I known it to be in the past overall disappointed won't be returning to this one ever again< /Text>

Very nice atmosphere, fast service, clean place. Our server was courteous and most importantly seemed lime they teally enjoyed their jobs. Great prices and observing server had 3 refills and never did I have to ask. Servers observe their tables and really never have to ask for anything.< /Review>

Actually not having been a strong supporter of the Denny's chain in the past due to mediocre food, I was pleasantly surprised when we stopped at one while on the road. I ordered one of their burgers off their new menu and it and the seasoned fries were actually very tasty. I may give them another shot locally some time and see if the consistency is there.< /text>

Quick and good, friendly staff.  Denny's has it all. One of the best tasting biscuits and gravy that I have ever had. Add fried eggs and hash browns makes it a complete meal.  Quality is great with no complaints. Highly recommend for all ages.</Text>

This Denny’s in North Palm Springs sits at the intersection of Indian Canyon and the Interstate I-10 Freeway, adjacent to Motel 6. The menu is standard Denny’s fare - bland food and low to moderate prices. I’ve visited this location at least five times and found that I return because the servers are polite and friendly, and they greet you with a smile. The food is prepared quickly and served hot, in a clean and inviting environment. I particularly like the chocolate milk shake with whipped cream that’s available 24 hours a day.

NOTE: The servers here work hard for low pay and tips. Consider that the average check for two totals $25 which translates to a $3.75 to $5.00 tip if they’re lucky. Not a lot of money for very physical and hard work. Think twice before you complain. The servers deserve a living wage and they deserve better from all of us.</text>

Tbone steak was like leather; very tough, hard to cut, chewy.
Crepes were very sweet but other than that ok.
Coffee was very light to the verge I thought I order coffee flavored water.< /text>

<review>Wasn't even busy and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. On top of that sat there for 20 minutes and never got help nor got for drinks. They helped others that got there after us, poor management and poor organization. Wasn't just us but table next to us also were treated bad. This is the Valleys poorest Dennys would not recommend coming here. Cathedral City and Thousand Palms always outstanding service.<//review>< Pictures>

Customer service was great. Order a fish dish with mashed potatoes... tatoes were not real unfortunately, they were box mashed potatoes. But, the rest of it was good.</Text>

<review>Very small portions. Food was cold and looked to have been old. Parts of our order did not come out and then we were told they didn't have what we wanted in stock after most of our order had already been made. Very disappointed in management of this location and will not likely return.< /review><time>1579550513609<//time>< userid>

<review>When we arrived there was no one to greet us or sit us at a table. After standing at the entrance several minutes one of the waiters tells us, sorry it's taking so long just grab a seat anywhere we'll be right with you. We sat down at the nearest booth. No one approached us for a few minutes so we asked one of the waitresses for menus and she then in a rude tone tells us something along the lines of, if we sat ourselves down no one told the server covering our section they got a new table. Then she said something like "that's why we have that sign that says wait to be seated". Everything she said to us I felt was very condescending so we stop her and explain we were standing there for several minutes no greeter was there to seat us at a table, one of the waiters working the bartop saw we had been standing there for a while and he told us to grab any table and someone would be with us shortly. Rather than apologizing or even just letting it go, the waitress goes further into her condescending remarks about us probably being tired from partying all stagecoach weekend and thinking it was a long time that we stood at the front but in actuality it wasn't that long. I was about to start arguing with her but chose to instead tell the table "I do not want to eat here anymore" so we got up and left. I couldn't believe the lack of professionalism from that waitress and the poorly managed restaurant that allowed that situation to even happen in the first place.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< time>

I asked 3 times to make sure the chicken is Extra Well Done, but still I received it not even cooked. Had to wait more till they recook it, and the bread got cold and my mood got ruined. And I didn't enjoy my food. ZERO TIPS.</text>

First the waitress yelled across the empty restaurant when I entered. Second a women in her thirties demanded I pay for her dinner cuz she was homeless! When I declined she got a paper place mat and pen from staff and wrote her demands for a free dinner on it she then put this paper on each occupied table which was 3. Staff watched her do this. A nice couple offered to pay for her to eat instead of thanking them she ordered her food and took it to go. She was very upset that she did not receive any change as she felt she should. The waitress I had was TERRIBLE. No silverware, food delivered at different times so some sat without food. Tried to get condiments and finally had to go to counter and get it. Steak was raw. Bread was dry.  They had no customers so why such poor service??? Shame on you Dennys!!!< /review>

I am very surprised at Denny's now, the quality and the flavor has greatly improved over the years. I find myself looking forward to eating there than not. This Denny's was clean with a warm and professional staff and great burgers and fries. Go and enjoy it< /text>

<Text>We went to this place for dinner at around 8.30 PM, and had to wait for around 10 minutes someone to show up at the waiting counter to find us a seat. It took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come and take an order. Meanwhile a family sitting across from us who probably had the same experience just left the restaurant without placing an order leaving the menus in their booth. The waitress after taking the order even brought the water after 15 minutes of placing the order. The food arrived very late and was not cooked properly.  The salmon flesh was not at all fresh, the rice was improperly cooked, and the bread was poorly done as well. Overall, our experience here was miserable.< /Text>< gmapID>

Will never go again, most employees are Hispanic.  Hispanic patrons that came in after us were waited on first and served before our order was even taken. We ended up walking out.  We drive that way about 4 times a year, will never stop there again.  Sucked!<//text>

Always love coming here. I wish I could give more STARS, always friendly people, clean area. Walk ways, bathroom, seating, it's ALL clean. Just found out they serve Grits! I'm so excited, I haven't had grits in over a year, this is the first place I've seen that serves them!</Review>

Big improvement from visit a couple of years ago.  Much cleaner!  Food was warm, but not hot.  The chicken fried steak I had tasted like fish ( I'm assuming it was cooked in oil that fried fish) other than that everything tasted fresh ( pancakes my husband had were nice and fluffy)</text>

Hot Roast Beef sandwich is always delicious!  Little pricey.... Service friendly, fast and welcoming.

Ate here once again recently and has gone downhill fast!  Dinner for 2 of us today very disappointed... Cooked very overdone food...relayed disappointment to female manager who really didn't seem to care..just lost our business...< /text>

<Review>Absolute WORST service I have experienced in a long time. One waitress had 3 tables to wait on. I waited 10 minutes for a refill on my drink (yes I counted), then was told I had to pay an extra charge for it. No apol8for the wait,  no "it's on the house since you had to wait".  Nope got charged. Then she brought me a new check with the added charge. She had time to drip the frust one, but not enough time to ask if I needed a refill, then has the incompetence to charge me. I could go on, but you get the point. Not going back there. Ever. If you're reading this, expect this type of service, and dont get mad when you get it. You were warned.<//Review>< pictures>

Wife and I went in for brunch on a Wednesday at 10 a.m.  The restaurant was not crowded.  We were seated without any eating utensils.  We ordered our food and drinks from our waitress Deja.  Our  waitress delivered the drinks, still no utensils.  The food came and we asked our waitress for utensils.  We waited five minutes with our food in front of us.  During this time we watched our waitress travel back and forth serving coffee to other customers.  The manager was notified, gave a weak apology, and offered to re-warm our food for us.  We walked out and went to another restaurant that treats its customers much better!</review>

Staff is great but that’s about it.  The food is terrible and overpriced and loaded with grease and cheese and just not healthy.  America’s diner... help America eat a bit healthier and make some changes.  Never again...</text>

Had a great experience this am! Took my great neice out for breakfast to celebrate her last day of school. We were greeted and seated promptly, our waitress was extremely polite and efficient, and our food was fresh and delicious, polar opposite of my last visit to this same location. Manager was very nice and interactive☺< /text>

<text>We recently moved back to the desert and we have been coming to this Denny's for the past 4 weeks. We receive great service every time (Michelle is awesome!!), and the place is clean. Only two small negatives that I can think of:
-- Most of the time the food is good, but sometimes it's swimming in a pool of grease.
-- Be careful when you come in the morning they have 2 elderly regulars that smell horrible!!! If they sit by you, you will lose your appetite.

The staff have always managed to solve the above issues with haste and with a smile.

We are looking forward to many more trips here!</text>< Rate>

<review>Passing thru.. Our waitress Irania mind was certainly not at work, absent minded i guess. Could not get her attention, served our food, no utensils, forgot gravy, salad dressing. Had to get up and go to the counter for more iced tea since she forgot that too! Waited another 10 mins. Just to order dessert and we caught the attention of another waitress ciana who ordered for us and got us our dessert.wont be coming back here soon.<//review>< pictures>

Absolutely horrible compared to any other Denny's. Service was bad in a nearly empty restaurant as well. When it came time to split my party's check, not one person there knew how to do it so after 10 minutes of them trying to figure it out, I just put everything on my card. This is the worst Denny's I've ever been to and I will not be back</text><Rating>1</Rating></record>

Just walked out of this horrible place! Had one waitress seat us then had a different one come take are orders while she was doing that she wasn’t even looking at us. Then I went to go ask for some water because no one came back to are table at all for 28 mins no food no refills nothing, when I asked for water the guy said okay then continued doing whatever he was doing just cracking jokes and then left while I was waiting for my waters and still nothing then he goes and gets some of the food that was ready to go out eats a little bit of it and still no waters i will never go back to this place horrible service not even a little dinner in the middle of no where has served me this bad!!!<//review>

Leonel Guzman, is the man at this Denny's. His wide smile and polite attitude left me with no choice but to greed him and thank him. Recommend this man to be at your help any time at this location.

Haven't gotten a refill on my coffee even though my cup has been empty and sitting on edge of table for a good 10 mins maybe more..pancakes are burnt I have never had burnt pancakes NOT very tasty at all...needless to say I will not come back to this Denny's ever...< /Review>< Pictures>

Our Waiter Andres. G was Extremely Rude and incompatent. 1st i ordered stack pancakes, never got them. Was charged tho. It is my uncles birthday and asked if they would Sing. He gave me the rudest most sarcastic version of happy birthday and a pat on the shoulder. I am so embarrassed. I will never go back there again.  I paid $41. Plus tipped the rude waiter. For the worest breakfast ever. And didnt even get everything i ordered.  dennys #9261</review>

Vegetables in my omelet were undercooked and some were over cooked. The cheese was like rubber. My omelet had a bitter taste.

The interior is extremely outdated giving the place a dirty look,  and it smelled. Initially a couple of staff were talking very loud about their personal business.

Positive..the small portion of hash browns and English muffin was ok.

I would not return here nor would I recommend this place.< /Text>

Not a very pleasant experience. After we sat down and took almost 20 minutes for us to even get someone's attention to ask for water or to take our order. When orders came there was many mistakes. In particular it was the fact that I had too big for service for water or napkins and I was constantly ignored even till the end. Very bad service . But good was food to be fair . Servive Not friendly at all. Saturday morning 10am< /Text>

This place used to be abandoned.... homeless people kicked it here....The mouth to mouth that brought this place back to life is impressive. It has that new look and feel to it, a clean bathroom, fast,friendly wait staff and   our empty plates slow clapped in appreciation. Pretty much what I expect from a Denny's</Text>

Always slow service when being seated. Food quality not great. Had the sample platter and the cheese sticks had ZERO cheese in them. I would NOT recommend anyone come to this one. If your coming from ou I of town drive an extra 15 to the one off of bob hope</review>

Small place. They only had 2 servers and our server made several mistakes with our orders. Not the best service but also not the worst.</Text>

The food is cheap and for the price it was just uhh. This was the 1st time going to dennys in like 10 years. Exactly how I remembered it from back then. Not very good.
The staff was very nice though.<//review>

<Review>I called in an ordered and they said that they’ll call me back to give me my total but they didn’t. Told me that I didn’t pick up the phone in a rude manner and only gave me burnt poorly cooked small portions of food for full price. A regular pancake shouldn’t be 2 inches in diameter. It was an awful experience. If I could rate less than one star, I would.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>The server  sat us down took 5min to take our order for drinks and from 2 booths away asked can I get you something to drink...wow 5 min later came back with drinks. Took our order without writing it down and obviously messed up on the order and blamed the cook.  Came only once to ask if we needed anything else..we were discussing about ordering some fries and she just walks away...my wife asked for a cup of coffee and asked for flavor creamer and she said I already brought you some..then my wife told her they're empty and she says yeah I saw that ..well I'll bring some more..so my wife just canceled the coffee because the server was just giving us attitude.  We didn't know our server's name, Alexis. til the end when she brought the check..she never introduced herself...overall her service was just horrible to only have one table that should've been a 5* service and she could've made a $10 tip..oh well her lost.  The steaks were cooked right, with te exception of the toast...but the food was good.  Next time, I will call to make sure who is working to avoid her.<//Review>< Resp>

<Text>We stopped for lunch while in the area.   The sad part was the multiple fatality collision on the WB I10.   Needless to say the traffic was horrendous.   It also impacted the restaurant with lots of customers and a short staff as they were stuck in traffic as well.  The staff on hand did a great job under the circumstances.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Always a pleasure. I almost always order same thing. Prime cob salad; triple meat, no potato sticks, whole avocado & meat steamed or grilled with water, no oil. They accomodate me with no fuss so thats great. Place is usually quiet but lotsa large parties during busy times. I've had large groups, (8+) & they always seem to be on the ball. With ez on/off fwy & phone orders to go, its awesome.
NOTE: If you phn order, MAKE SURE to communicate precisely what you want & the person taking the call is CLEAR on your instructions & specific preference/s. But be flexible if you're in a hurry so don't trip if order isn't perfect. We're still on earth so remember people are still people. Good eats!</text>< pictures>

< Review>
I usually come to this Dennys alot and the people here are usually great but tonight idk if there is a full moon out tonight or what but service was beyond horrible and I understand that when a place gets busy it takes longer but when you get there and only two other people are there before you and it takes forever to get your food it's un called for. the rest of my family got their food and it took another 20 mins for me to get mines how does that work. After we got our food finally a group of 10 people came in so we figured it would take a little bit for the manager to get back to us no biggy. More people come in not a lot but a few groups of 2s. The heavy set black girl tends to everyone that comes in and gets them going yet speeds passed our table every chance she got. As so is the manager helping everyone else and rushing past our table as well. So 40 minutes after the group of 10 has ordered and gotten their food still no one to check on us asked if we wanted refills another stack of pancakes for my son since that's what he ordered the all you can eat and had already finished his food and the 1st set of pancakes before I had gotten my food. I'd had enough I stood up to walk towards the counter to ask for refills and I went off the manager hurried up and got the refills and put in another order for pancakes for my son but by this time we've  already had been there for almost 2 hours and my youngest son was getting very agitated. The Manager never apologized didn't offer to take nothing off the bill or anything. The heavy set black girl got pissed because we asked for a box to go because we had been waiting forever for service. It's like like this every time I go there but the White Manager with the beard and the black heavy set girl were both horrible tonight the old mexican guy busting tables and the cook did a good job. Idk if you had someone call off tonight but this was the worst service that I've ever had. I didn't even leave a tip because it was truly horrible and I always tip either 15% - 20% or $5, $10, or $20.</Review>
