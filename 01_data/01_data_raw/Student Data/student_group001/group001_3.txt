When I think of customer service. I think about Dominique Brown. She was so helpful with my visit the other day. She was fast and efficient and very knowledgeable in what she was talking about. She made it so easy to rent a space. I was mind blown. If I could give 100 stars I would. This girl needs a raise. I would recommend this location to anybody who is looking for a storage. Dominique Brown is the best! She will take care of you!<//review>

Dominique and Marina are the best. They have always helped me and answered my questions since the beginning. I've had 3 units there since my move, down to 1 now, but no problems. Great location and easy access. I would recommend.<//review>

Greeted kindly by the wonderful Marina, she was very helpful in explaining how to rent a storage unit (it is my first time) and recommended the best unit for what I was needed. She explained everything I would need for moving and helped me out pretty quickly. She’s  personable, and super nice.< /Review>

<text>Good price, friendly staff, clean location with sufficient security.   Bring home owners or renter's insurance information as they require it (it may or may not cover the unit anyway).  If you do not have insurance they will require you buy insurance to cover the unit.  Also bring a strong lock as they also require one for entry.  If you do not bring one they will make you buy a lock.  So far so good; however, they need to have more carts on hand as there are only two available and they often are both being used.</text>< pictures>

I have rented from a few storages over the years, but I must say by far this one was the best of all. The facility is clean and is easily accessible. The property manager, Dominique, is very helpful and  friendly.  She goes out of her way to be helpful,  which is nice when you have your life things in storage. Keep up the good work and thank you!!< /review>

It can be tricky to locate and determine where the entrance is, and if you miss it you have to drive a bit before you can turn around. After you have been there once or twice, it's fine. I helped a friend move their property into here. The staff was extremely nice, helpful. The storage was clean and didn't see any bugs. There was a faint smell of mold in the hallways, but I didn't see any mold anywhere and definitely didn't see or smell mold inside his storage.< /review>

I had a great experience working with Dominique when I first moved in my belongings and also when I just recently moved all of my stuff out.  Dominique was always very friendly, extremely professional, and she was prompt in getting back to me to answer all of my questions.  I would recommend using this Public Storage facility given Dominique's stellar performance!<//review>

<review>I had a wonderful experience with the company. Both the phone operator and it's employees, especially the manager Seana, were extremely helpful, friendly, and great with communication (phone calls/text/email confirmations). They helped me get the unit I wanted and at an awesome price! The company has wonderful promotions so you definitely get the bag for your buck.  I highly recommend them if you're looking for storage.<//review><userid>109143050603658456856</userid><Name>Brittney Cortez< /Name><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1390950916060< /date><rating>5< /rating>< Response>

<text>Seana is the most amazing manager. She is well beyond kind and friendly and has provided my entire family with accessible and affordable storage units for years. She is always friendly with her reminders and always provides them with enough time for us to get everything prepared for the next month. She is a delight both as a manager and as a person. It is so refreshing to go in and just have a chat with her. She is not one of those managers who just gives you your unit and leaves it at that. She inquires about my day and makes me feel so comfortable. She makes this experience spectacular. As far as I'm concerned, as long as she's here, so shall my family and I be. I highly suggest you switch from whatever storage place you're at to this one. You're more than welcome to be here, and Seana makes sure you feel that way.</text>< user_id>

I was able to obtain a reasonably priced indoor ground floor unit immediately, and was given the facility tour and all necessary information by Chris. There were carts carts available to schlep our boxes and furniture to the unit, locks, and etc., and I was able to add the friends helping me to the authorized access list. Chris was helpful, knowledgeable, and courteous. Thank you for the help!<//Review>

The staff at this location is outstanding. They are friendly and helpful always. There are few business of any kind that can boast those qualities in staff.  The facilities are well maintained and kept tidy at all times. If you have a need for storage this is a great location and I highly recommend it.< /text>

Very convenient area, and knowledgeable staff, the rep broke down the type of space I needed and didn’t try to sell me more than what I needed, going through a moving transition right now so this experience was not a hassle at all, very impressed with her public relations.</text>

Seana is a very good manager.. Always greets you with a smile and very helpful. At the last  minute I was in need of a Storage Space and mot only was there one available, I got the 1st month for only a dollar.

Thank you Seana for your Professional help.<//Review>

My parents were putting their house on sale and needed to vacate within a week to have it remodeled and staged. Needless to say, they accumulated a ton of crap over the past 20+ years, and they needed a place to store it— fast.

Public Storage was perfect for our needs, and our property manager Dominque's customer service was icing on the cake.

She was extremely knowledgeable and patiently explained all of the important rental details to my dad, who has a hearing disability. We ran into two major obstacles while we were renting the unit, and each time, Dominique calmly and thoughtfully explained our options. Her leadership and resourcefulness put us at ease in spite of the initial panic we felt stumbling upon these obstacles.

Thank you, Dominique, for being so helpful and amazing to work with! I'll happily recommend Public Storage because of the great experience she gave us while renting our unit.</review>

<text>This is my favorite location, as I have rented from many Public Storage locations in the Bay Area, in my line of work.  I have always had a great experience along with great prices. I really like the manager here, shes always helpful & greets you with a big smile.

The property manager Dominique was extremely helpful and courteous and has made renting through public storage a breeze.  Because of her I will keep doing business at this location.< /Text>

It's been a while, however I want to make sure that I recognize Shana and I cannot remember the other lady's name.  Instead of ignoring a mishap in a check that I wrote they saw it and called me immediately, so that I could correct it before it turned into a huge problem with my checking account.  Thank you for your professionalism and true consideration of your customer.  Gloria Samayoa</Review>

Amazing quality with the whole menu. I have to have King Kebab once a week and every time it is so good. Recommend to everyone. A hidden Gem in downtown San Bernardino. Best basmati  rice I’ve ever had and the chicken kebab is amazing.<//Review>

<review>Casual Mediterranean restaurant located in downtown Berkeley. Came across wanting a gyro and found this place with high ratings.

<Review>This place is awesome. You can sense that the restaurant is family run the minute you walk in (okay, everyone seems a little bit inexperienced). They are doing their best to serve the customer, but they don't do regular check in with you. I normally would be okay with it, but the day I went was hot and they never refilled my water.< /Review></record>

We ordered chicken kebab platter and chicken shawarma. Chicken kebab was actually a few cut pieces of undercooked chicken with boiled kind if rice very lowly seasoned or probably not seasoned at all. The chicken Shawarma was thin cut chicken pieces that looked like some pieces of topping which didn't taste good. We love Mediterranean food and have tried food from little Tehran which is amazing and tastes great every time. This food was so disappointing never ordering again.<//review>< Pictures>

OMG!  We came for lunch on a Friday and were super impressed!  This is one of the best new restaurants we've tried in a while.  Amazing food, and good service in a casual, welcoming setting.</Review>

Placed a take-out order at 5:45pm and they said to pick it up at 6:15pm when I arrived at 6:17pm, I was told it would be 15min late. There’s only one other person here so I think they forgot< /Text>

I recommend Kings Kabobs to eat there or take home.

The beef kabob sandwich is really good it's on pita bread.

Grilled over a fire and I substitute hummus with the vinegar, oil & spice salad dressing.

Nothing fancy in fact it's literally a hole in the wall with 2 small serving windows in the side of the building. A couple of patio tables to eat or you can eat inside a couple of doors West.

Absolutely nothing fancy simply great food. Friends who have ordered other item menus are equally impressed< /Review>

Excellent food at good price.

Truly a hole in the wall because there are 2 windows in the side of the building to order from.

There is a small two table patio to eat but mostly take out. There is a small coffee shop/restaurant two doors down where you can eat inside.

This is one of those neat littleplaces which does what it does well.

I recommend the beef kabob sandwich.<//text>

<review>Worse service ever when they are busy. Came to pick up an order late night and simply stated the order number and was told when I talk to you, you tell me the order number as the man yelled out someone’s name. I personally don’t care how good food is if the service is trash!<//review><Rating>1<//Rating>< user_name>

Absolutely disgusting food and experience. Ordered on uber eats and was never this disappointed. The greek feta fries were simply a handful of frozen fries with an abysmally small side of feta crumbs... for 6$ that must have been a joke.

The lettuce in the kabobs was roman lettuce splattered in E-coli and the meat was bland and dry. I have never had such a horrible kabob. Dont trust the fake reviews and dont order there.</Text>

Love going here for the gyros and the owners are really nice, the place itself has a couple of chairs but you can also eat inside the Kings Cafe. Plus the prices are quite reasonable<//Text>

I'm ok with this place food wise.  But the last time I went there, there was dirt under the guy's nails like he'd just changed the oil in his car.  Yuk!</Review>

By far this is the best Thai massage place.   It’s the only Thai massage place that I know of that has a neck pillow and bars for the massage therapist to hang on to.  My therapist is Zacha and she knows exactly where your body is tight and works on untangling the knots.  It’s very clean and professional and I highly recommend it.< /review>

5 Stars for every masseuse at Thai Sport Bodyworks!
I see Jane every week for 2 hours.  I always benefit from more.
She went on a brief vacation so I was worried I could not live without her.
Today Sasha filled in for Jane and was excellent.  Wow. Fantastic.
I feel very lucky that this place can be trusted to take care of my broke body during Covid.   Thank you so much, Award-Winning TSB!< /Review>

I've always had shoulder and neck problems and Jane has really been able to get my knots out. They check my temperature at every appointment and clean extensively between massages. I definitely have found my massage place for good!<//Review>

Cannot recommend highly enough!!! A real life changer! As a prior athlete I won’t go anywhere else. I got tired of feeling exactly the same after massage, like pressure was not enough and I didn’t have any difference in muscle tension. This place will ACTUALLY get into those knots and address issues in your muscles like an athlete needs. The atmosphere is very professional and staff is friendly. Not uncommon to find the owner there at the front desk to make sure you’re making use of reward programs and continue to return for future business. They are wonderful with their loyal customers and make you feel appreciated!! Don’t waste your time and money with ANY other massage therapy in the city. If I didn’t live in north county near the RB office, I would still drive here. I’m SOLD and you will be too if you’re serious about feeling better after treatment. Five stars doesn’t begin to express how highly I recommend!!< /Text>

As I googled the nearest Thai sport massage, Thai Sport Bodyworks, the closest one at that time popped up and I decided to give it a try. With varying issues from sore back and shoulders from constant lifting to tingling in hands, sciatic pains from years of abusing my body in the military, I can truly say that I am a regular at these types of pain relief establishments. Acupuncture, chiro, massages, water therapy, you name it, I do them all. I was very glad that I visited TSB on that day,  because this is where I met Zasha. Although I had been to a lot of Thai sport massages all over the states and outside the country, I have never had anyone as thorough and attentive as Zasha. She does not just go through the motion like everyone else. She knows you are there for a reason so she listens, she remembers, and she asks a lot of questions on what you need work on at each and every visit and massaged accordingly. The first time she worked on me, I noticed that I felt differently from when others worked on me. To confirm that I was not being biased, I had to go see other therapists elsewhere just to compare, and in my opinion, she is one of the best ones out there! She genuinely cares about her clients. Most of all, one can easily tell that she is the type of person that not only enjoys her job, but really takes pleasure in helping people, and so I always recommend Zasha to my friends and family.</review>

<review>I love Thai Sport Bodyworks! I have been a fan since they originally started in a small two room section of a gym in Sorrento Valley. I'm happy to see the business grow with this new location. They can do very deep tissue or a more relaxed spa type massage. The hot stones are the best! Try it and you won't regret it. It's good to call and explain what type of massage(pressure type) you want so they can match with the perfect therapist.< /review><time>1532744764017<//time><response>{'time': 1532753553869, 'text': 'Tommy, thanks for following us since 2013.

The best sports massage that I have found. Depending on your needs the massage also includes stretching.
If you creat an account and become a member (for free), there are some great perks offered to you.

Thai Sport has the best massage/body work staff! I’ve been coming here (and Sorrento Valley location) for over 3 years now and continue to come back. This new location has a body scanner that provides detailed analysis of your body alignment, an awesome tool. Everyone I’ve worked with here is very knowledgeable and friendly. Highly recommeneded!!<//text>

<text>THE BEST THAI MASSAGE EVER. And when I mean EVER, I literally mean ever - even after getting massages in Thailand twice a day  come here, you won't be disappointed!

MASSAGE: they not only have traditional, but variations depending on what your body needs. Our favorite is the Thai Therapeutic - OMG HURTS so GOOD! They are very skilled and know soft tissue techniques that reset your muscles but also can mix it with very relaxing techniques. They also have extra add ins like essential oils, CBD oils, cupping, hot stones, & hot Thai compress. Our favorite masseuses are Lawani, Primo, Gail, & Abby!

SERVICE: my boyfriend and I have been going here for YEARS, about 6 years, and we LOVE everyone who works here, especially the owner Lawani!!! She is so dedicated to providing the best customer service and is so personable. She is kind, sweet, so smart, and an amazing Business Owner! She is legit Thai and knows what's up!

AMBIANCE: they moved to another building down the road, and inside the office building. Inside there are tons of rooms and in the rooms they are super clean and comfortable set up. The lobby area has couches and a water dispensers for you to take your time after a massage.

PARKING: a lot with tons of stalls

PRICE: sooooo reasonable for the quality!!!! And you get to be a part of a rewards program which you can benefit from immediately.</text><Time>1557096654651< /Time>< user_name>

I went to her every 2-3 weeks before my last bikini competition and she made a world of difference in my recovery.  I was able to get technical with her and talk about my imbalances and previous injuries.  She is very intuitive with the human body and a natural healer.  We did a mixture of deep tissue, trigger point therapy, cupping, stretching, and thai massage.  Highly recommend!

And update...I went to Noi when Lawani was out of town and I really enjoyed working with her as well!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dbf14e568f3095:0x583c27faae50756c<//gmap_id></record>

I was in desperate need of a massage, with a six-week project finally over, but I didn’t want to go to the corporate-style, assembly line massage franchises that seem to be crowding out the ‘authentic experience’. So, I did some exploring and came up with a few massage businesses that were of interest. The one that struck me as ‘stand-out’ was a recently opened place in Rancho Bernardo called Thai Sport Bodyworks. I scheduled an appointment on-line within my scheduling constraints. Easy enough, but the actual experience far exceeded my expectations.

The reception area is warm, welcoming and inviting. The staff is enthusiastic, knowledgeable and friendly. They really seem to sincerely care about your problems and concerns and are more than helpful in recommending, but also dissuading, services that may not be right for you. The therapy rooms are authentic Thai, cozy and intimate. The subtle fragrances, muted lighting, and ethereal background music are idyllic, and are the ultimate enhancements to an already comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. You are swept into the prefect mood, mind and body, for one of the best massage experiences ever.

Maya was my therapist. I chose the Thai Sport massage, their special version of Thai massage. Though she is petite in stature; she is strong, but with a subtle touch and technique, and possesses a vast knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and body kinetics. She was able to communicate with me in an open and accessible way, starting out with a lighter touch and moving toward progressively deeper pressure, in a suitably adapted and appropriate manner, with my stiff, tight, sensitive lower back and shoulders yielding to her firm pressure, loosening and releasing knots, muscle tension and fatigue.

Although other Thai massages that I’ve had are way too ‘deep-tissue’ and didn’t adequately address my upper back and shoulders, this massage was definitely not that. It was the ideal fusion of East and West massage techniques, and very much the therapeutic massage that my body was longing for. The essential oils treatment was included. I had the Soothe, but there are others, depending on your needs. The add-ons I chose were heated stone treatment and the cupping, for different impairments and dysfunctions, but I highly recommend both.

Working a computer or in meetings all day, leaves my body cramped, sore and fatigued. Though I spend as much free time as I can in the gym, on my bike, or on the trails, it seems to never be enough to compensate for the time spent ‘sitting’. I have finally found a sports therapy and massage spa that fits my schedule and my budget for bi-weekly or even weekly visits. This time I had the 90 minutes Thai Sport, but am eagerly looking forward to trying the neuromuscular, therapeutic massages, and their dynamic stretching services. As an added benefit they have a full 3-D Body Scanner that syncs up with the ‘cloud’ to enable me to track my progress and improvements over time and share that information with my personal trainer.

I can’t commend the staff enough. They are hospitable, eager, and knowledgeable. The spa is well designed, with a pleasant feel, discriminating taste, and an aura of heartfelt sense of well-being. And Maya was extraordinary! The entire encounter is the best massage experience I have had, ever. Five-star, and I highly recommend Thaisport!</Text>

My to go place for massage and stretching. They have all kind deep issue swedish even stretching. I love this location because of it closer to my house also it brand new and the decoration looks more modern spacy I also stretching room. So cool, I have tried a lot of their therapist Thais and Americans male and female they all great. I have been coming here since 2014. My recommendation is either Thaisport or Thai Neuromuscular depends on how my body feeling. If i need focus and posture correction i do Neuromuscular,  if i need overall work out i go with thaisport
Online booking make it so easy for me as at work i can not make a call.
Highly recommended
Try it and let me know !<//text>

I'm very happy that they expanded to Rancho Bernardo. It's closer to my work and home when compared to their Sorrento Valley location. The RB location is bigger, brighter, and roomier.

I went to many other massage places before finding Thai Sport Bodyworks. Most other massage places do not care about your body and give you the same genetic massage they give everyone else. More personalized massage franchises have terrible business models/payment policies. I would know because I used to be a member of a well known massage franchise, but ended my membership after paying for months which I did not need a massage.

Which brings me to this place and Lawani. I found Lawani after I sprained my right shoulder in 2013. I had a lot of aches and pain when moving it. I couldn't believe how much better my shoulder felt after the initial visit. It felt like I finally got my shoulder back. Then a few months down the road, I pulled my hamstring which caused sciatica. I was doing physical therapy for the hamstring/sciatica, but I truly believed it was a combination of a chiropractor's adjustments and Lawani's massages that finally cured the sciatica. The Kaiser physical therapy was a waste of money.

I'm very happy that I found Lawani. I bring myself in and pay only when my body needs maintenance. Gone are the days when I paid for a generic massage. Also, gone are the days when I used to pay a monthly massage subscriptions to a massage franchise. Now I pay for great massages only when I need them. I have recommended this place to my friends and co-workers.

I'm so happy to have known Lawani since the time she used to be located inside of a small gym, but now they have 2 locations! New location, same great owner.</Review>

The staff here are great. You can park overnight and check in early to get a buzzer. I didn't see any bathrooms, but I wasn't exactly looking for any. From the time I hit the dock to the time I was released was about 40 minutes. It's always quick here. Great place to deliver. The management here clearly has its fingers on the pulse and staffs the business with great people. A+ as a driver delivering here.</Review>

Has over night parking, don't go too fast or you might miss the truck entrance right before the building next to the large dirt lot. Only 1 receiving door and its alittle snug. Straight back. Bathroom under the stairs next to door. Fast unload.< /Text>

Always courteous employees. Today tho the gentleman that helped us as well as checked us out from the moment we opened the hamburger freezer door had heard my friend n I talk about which one was the lean one and he spoke up giving us the run down on each variety. He was highly knowledgeable not only with the hamburger packs but with the steaks and the patties. That in itself is a plus seller to me. I unfortunately didn't get his name but he did mention the fact that he's been in the meat business since 5 years old . Growing up on a farm .etc. Great customer service skills! Thank you!!<//review>

I absolutely love this place!!! I wish I could give them a 6 star review. Their workers show exceptional customer service, very polite and helpful. As for the quality of meat I don't know about their other customers and their negative reviews I believe it's one of the best in the city. People need to learn how to cook and season their food better instead of blaming it on the place that sells it to them. By the way Richwood also cooks and sells certain cuts of meat 6 star ratings from this customer. Keep up the amazing work Richwood and keep stalking up this ribs, tri tips and steaks.< /Review>

Well, we just needed some longhorn cheese and then my wife ran into Eric. $75 later we walked out without any longhorn cheese as they were out ,but two tri-tips, two packs of ribs, a rub and a BBQ sauce.  Lol. At least I know it will be good as always</Review>

Me and my girlfriend were skipped for a older white gentlemen. We ordered the same ammount of food only we ordered 5 mins before him. It was not a preordered order, a lady with glasses working up front went specifically to the back to make the sandwich. Never coming here again.< /text>

An excellent place to get deli meats, steaks, tritips, and fantastic sandwiches. They are not a full butcher shop, so don't expect to order specific cuts if meat. But their prices are some of the best in town.<//Text>

We recently had dinner at the local vfw here in town and they bought their new York steaks from Richwood meats.let me tell you these steaks are so tender you can cut  them with your fork. They are out of this world tasty an flavorful. If you are 100%happy with these steaks I'll  eat them for you.</Review>

We just love the place, customer service great,  we had cooked spareribs to munch on while we drove home and the price and quality of their chixken and hamburger patties is always lower than our local markets. Can't beat it anywhere.<//text>

I wish google had native rating. This place is stupid. This facility is FCFS and I was told to check in at 5:30am for frozen load. Got here at 5:30am. But they will gave first priority to their own trucks or fresh meat. If your delivering here frozen bring snacks with you cuz it doesn’t matter if you your sitting here for 5 hours and fresh meat truck shows up they will take him in before you. Fresh meat trucks take up to anywhere from 3-5 hours and they have only 1 dock the other dock it for lift gate trailer’s.</text>

Excellent Persian food. I highly recommend the chicken thigh kebab. Combo #6 or Combo #2 if you'd like some beef with it.< /Text>

Excellent Persian food.  It should get 7 stars, but you can only award 5.....modest interior but clean, and very friendly service.  And the portions are large, definitely great value.  Quality  food too, very fresh.  Highly recommend this place.< /review>

I love this place not just because the food is great, but also because they have such a variety.  I love that I have a chance to try various stews along with kabobs and wraps.  Also, you will not find a friendlier staff.  7 Star Kabob is well worth the trip!</Text>

<Review>My family and I visited this restaurant. The food and the service were excellent! The falafel was the best I have ever tried. The baklava was so delicious served with tea. A treat for the whole family; all three children enjoyed their meals immensely.< /Review>< username>

Small place in a small strip of stores. Not fine dining atmosphere or for hipsters, but simple, clean, and great food at an average price. Chili Chutney started in this space too and did very well. As most others here said, food is great and the people are extremely friendly. Small menu, but hey, the name is "Taste of Kabob" :) Kabobs are tender and flavorful. Salad has a nice lemon tang. Bread is fresh and hot. Overall a very pleasant experience. If you like Persian food or want to try some tasty chicken or beef, go here. (Great hot tea was not free as someone else said but I have no doubt the friendly owners occasionally offer something on the house.)<//Text>

My husband and I absolutely loved the barg kabob and beef lunch special which we had today from Taste of Kabob restaurant.The barg kabob was very tender and juicy which I had half rice and half salad. The salad had lemon dressing and it was very fresh and tasty. The bread  we had it was the best bread I ever had for long time ! Fresh, soft, and crispy .everything was wonderful, and clean. The young lady who was working there was very nice and friendly to us and we will definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone and will go there soon.They deserve five stars. Thank you .< /review>

We have been there for our company's Christmas gathering, Their KOOBIDEH is the best in O.C, the FESENJOON was so delicious and CHICKEN KEBOB was perfect. I also loved the vibe in their store. Father, mother and their daughter were so welcoming and respecful. I recommend this place to all persian and others who love good quality food. There is no regrets.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I know good Persian food, and this place has it. From the traditional Ghormeh Sabzi  to the  familiar kabobs, you are eating the authentic thing here, and it's delicious. The restaurant itself is small and unassuming with limited seating inside and a few tables outside. When we ate here, several customers picked up orders, so take-out appears to be a popular choice. The owners are friendly and make sure you are enjoying yourself. Tea is excellent and served with traditional sugar cubes. My daughter (3) was also a huge fan, so your picky toddler may have met their match here. Persian food isn't exactly rare here in OC, but this is the best I've had outside of LA, and that's saying something. Fine dining it is not, but if you're in it for the food alone, you will be most impressed with what you eat here.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

The best persian kabob ever! Food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. I highly recommend it. Enjoy the perfect hospitality of the chef and his staff!

The best persian kabob ever! Food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. I highly recommend it. Enjoy the perfect hospitality of the chef and his staff!

Tried this place for the first time yesterday for lunch.  It was really incredible food and I don't use that work often.  The Kaleh Paacheh, dizzy, and tongue sandwich were all amazing,  We also got special number 2, chicken kabab and koobideh and those were very very good as well.  It is a small family run business with excellent food, I recommend this place.<//Text>

Now we are talking. Finally OC brings a real Persian food. You definitely have to try this place out. Koubideh, barg, gheimeh, ghormeh all taste great.

Awesome customer service as well.<//Text>

This is very small resturan with mid class "BUT" This is only place in Orange County that makes kabab koobideh with(half beef & half lamb) this is so delicious and juicy,I love the flavor and taste ....
To be honest with you
if you live in this area,I am telling you go and try it!!!
It's worth it 👌< /Review>

7 star kabab has the best kabab orang county. Usually every where they charge for yogurt and bread but this place is for free. They have the style of Persian restaurant. Persian music is playing. This place has a great costumer service, they will give free salad, yogurt and bread. The kabab is the most tasful kabab I have ever had. #khalepache # halim #under #new #managment< /review>

I really recommend Lozano.  The 3 guys are great mechanics and figured out how to get my brakes sorted.  They're honest and I overheard them tell a nearby customer how to save money on his car's cooling issue.  They'll work with what you have and can repair many issue in 3 hours or less.  Walk-ins are accepted and you can pay by credit card.< /review>

< Review>
Amazing experience!
I am just another software guy in the bay area, looking for ways to fix an issue I had with my BMW 340i. I was exploring auto services in and around SVL/MTV and came across Lozano. Usually when I see such positive reviews (all close to 5 stars), I am a little skeptical and always think the reviews are faked of sort. Either way, I decided to give this place a shot.

My BMW's under car shield had torn apart and BMW quoted high fees to replace them. When I went there, Vince first came out to inspect the car. Vince took the car inside, put it on the machine that lifted my car up. With this, we were able to clearly see what the damage was.

Vince and Troy together spent time removing the torn parts out so that my car was at least in a drivable condition. They spent 15 minutes, passionately explaining various parts of the undercover shield. After that, they told me precisely which parts I needed to replace, which was fewer than what BMW had asked for.

After this was done, Vince just lowered my car and said I was set to go, NOT EVENING ASKING FOR ANY $. I was stunned and very pleasantly surprised. They never charge you without knowing any upfront costs. In this case, I felt they definitely deserved to be paid so I decided I would come back to them with the new parts and pay them then.

As promised, I came back with the new parts I purchased from BMW and once again, Vince and his team fixed it for me at a very low cost.

If you are looking for no BS, perfect pricing and passionate set of folks, this is the place to go!

In picture, you can see Troy helping me out :)

Kudos to Troy and Vince!

Thank you Lozano :)<//Review>

Honestly one of the worst shop experiences I’ve ever had they were rude and hung up on me multiple times on the phone. They originally quoted me for a certain price and when I came in they jacked up the price almost double the original amount when I asked them why they said that if I didn’t like it I could go to another shop<//review>

<text>My car run out of battery after months parking and also I found out there was some liquid on the battery. I am not sure if the battery was leaking so I dropped by and ask for a quick check to see if I need to replace it. The gentle man (sorry, I forgot his name) over there was very nice and did a battery test for me and also checked the liquid and told me he thinked that was some oil put by somebody else (maybe from my dealer when I did regular maintain) so I don't need to do anything. I was very happy for his professional service and he was so nice a people!<//text><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Recently discovered Lozano Auto Service when my van would not start. They quickly discovered the problem & required work for  several days.  I appreciated the fact that they kept me informed throughout those days about the progress in repairing my van & any additional issue's requiring authorization. This will now be my auto mechanic shop of choice & not the only one who recommends Lozano's.</text>

Excellent service. They listened to me and were friendly and honest.
I came here based on my boss's recommendation after she heard about my struggle at Kia dealership. First I spoke with Vince and he quoted me several options for my brake repair based on how extensive the repair was going to be.
When I came in following week , Paul was the one to take care of me. Price was right and everything got fixed.  Paul even showed me the old parts and explained what was causing all the unpleasant noise. I'm so happy my car is finally running well.
Thank you so much! I will be back for maintenance.

< Review>
Used to be a fantastic shop always putting covers on seats and paper floor mats but now that's not done and thier preventative maintenance is non existent not to mention the dirty hand prints getting your car back and having to go clean it yourself. Even though everybody there is very nice except for one of the mechanics who gets upset whenever he's asked to do something to help someone and makes nothing for it even though he's has to help a customer that's been there forever. It's too bad because they used to be so good.</Review>

Wow!  Lozano’s knocked it out of the park today!  We were in for one weekend and our son’s car’s AC stopped working and it was making a weird metallic sound. We called Friday. Paul Hensley took our call and said we could drop it off on Saturday morning. Later that day he called and had it all fixed. He was honest, fair priced and reliable. I would recommend Lozano’s whole heartedly!</review>

Absolute worst customer service. I was told it would be a half hour wait. Turned to an hour. I opted to return the next day. I arrived at opening 0900. Again half hour wait. No effort to accommodate with an appointment. Will not return ever.< /Review>

I have been coming here for years.  Absolutely love how Wendy does my nails, pedicures and my eyebrows.  I would never think of letting anyone else take care of me and am never rushed.  Always make an appt.
It is the proper way to do things as they are very busy but will always try to accommodate you.  Leon is my very favorite to tease, of course, but I think Wendy is the real BOSS!!❤❤❤</Review>

< Review>
I've been coming here for years. One of the first things I noticed was how clean they were. They have two male technicians and about 5-6 females. Everyone is wonderful but my favorite is Kim. They get busy in spurts and are very honest when you walk in how long the wait will be. The reason I have stayed with them for this long is because I value my time and appointments and so do they which is VERY rare in this industry.

Only downfall would be you can only leave a cash tip. Doesn't matter now, I'm used to it but at first I would forget and feel horribly guilty lol.

They definitely do not rush even if they are busy. Prices are also probably the lowest I have found. They are very fair and honest. Love them all to pieces.</Review>

< review>
This was my first visit to this salon. They had decent reviews on Google which made me choose them over the place I normally go but is a bit farther from me.

I went ahead and made a same day appointment. They were busy when I arrived, and they remained very busy during my visit. There was only the option for pedicure and spa pedicure, both of which were $18. There are no add-ons (extra scrubs, callous removers, etc).

The calf and foot massage, though brief, felt very nice. It was a short pedicure, lasting approximately 30 min of in chair time, not including drying time.

If you're looking for a very basic, quick and inexpensive pedicure, this is a good option.

However, I don't think I'll be coming back. I enjoy the add-ons and don't like feeling rushed.<//review>

Muhammad is a great owner, and the team he leads is fantastic. My first visit, I had a little bit of a financial issue replacing two tires, but Muhammad was kind enough to  help me out. I commute 150 miles everyday. It would’ve been impossible for me to drive on my run flats, but Muhammad and his team at this shop made sure that even with my little issue I would be able to get home , to work the next day, then back to their auto shop SAFELY. These guys are very kind and amazing!</Review>

<text>They replaced my tires a few months ago and it wasn't until I got a flat tire just today that I realized that they ruined the threads on my wheel hub and now I have to replace the whole wheel hub/bearing assembly. They also denied service just now when I came to get my flat tire worked on even though I had paid for the tire protection plan. The guy requested I give him a good review on Google Maps last time I came due to apparently a "previous" owner accumulating too many bad reviews and affecting his business.< /text>< pics>

<response>None</response><Text>BEWARE OF OLD REVIEWS, THEY ARE FOR THE PREVIOUS BUSINESS AT THIS LOCATION.

Took more than 2 hours to get an alignment performed with an appointment. They first tried to overcharge me for a 4 wheel alignment on a vehicle which only needs 2 wheel (solid rear axle). They didn't give me the print out upon completion. So I told them I wanted it. Once I received it, NONE of the measurements were changed at all. I asked for a refund and they still tried to get me to schedule another appointment to have more work done that they claimed was necessary. I'm a car guy and know my vehicle inside and out.. the work they claimed that I needed or my "wheels would fall off" was completely bogus. Will never be returning to this place<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<rating>1</rating><Review>They seem clueless. Drove my car up onto the lift wrong, failed to apply a patch. I came back the next day after flat wasn't fixed and they said I need 1 new tire, then 2 new tires, then that they could repair the patch. Could barely tell me which tires were in stock.

Ended up taking it to another shop who patched it in 10 minutes and said the patch this shop applied had fallen completely off (2 miles of driving).</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Not even one star . They took my car in to replace suspension components it's been there for 3 weeks with story after story . Eventually I had to go down there and install what I could and tow it to another shop . They ruined a vacation I had planned and list money with deposits etc . I had to uber to work costing money . They absolutely do not know what they are doing and would not recommend them to work on my daughter's tricycle. I can't believe they do business this way I will end up taking them to court for monies lost .<//Text>

Very nice team that works at the Fremont location and very prompt service. Came in needing a patch on a slow leaking tire and they got it fixed up very quickly and at a very reasonable rate.< /text>

<review>This place is no longer Fremont Tire Pros as of 4 months ago. Ron and Steve are no longer here, disregard any reviews older than 4 months from this review.

Otherwise these guys are alright, decent pricing and fair service. Not sure if the guys here know what theyre doing, one of them couldnt even drive my car onto the lift straight and my car was up crooked to the left, not a good look for my first time coming here.</review>< Pictures>

Very genuine, friendly people! I would love to come back again and again.

Fremont Toyota asked me to replace rotors and break pads for a very small issue I have with my breaks. It’s just 2 year old car.

These people gave a perfect solution bcoz my break pads are still like new and rotor had lot more life.< /review>

I took my dads van in to get an estimate on replacement for tires. He offered me a great rate. I am sure to come back to them and to speak to Muhamad. He said he has coupons out. Just need to find them on his facebook or instagram, but the will take care of me this time. cool guy!< /Text>

Fremont Pro Tires has been an excellent local service for us for over 25 years (previously Big O). The owners are always helpful AND honest. We have taken our cars in for tires, repairs, maintenance and we have always been more than satisfied.  I recommend them to everyone.< /Text>

<Text>Never go there again, ever. Left my car for an oil change, came back, paid, drove home and found out what niser oil or filter were changed. Came back and ask for refund, being charged the second time and then got rebate. If they can do that to customers, I'm not going there anymore.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1573603797738, 'text': 'Hi sir did you come 42240 fremont blvd fremont Nor cal tires and wheels'}< /resp>< gmapID>

The manager muhammad doesnt know anything about your vehicle. Danny only does. How are you going to keep a shop running and not no anything about cars. Failure is where i see these guys are going. Garbage!< /Text>

Fremont tire pro customer service below par. They don't care about customers. I had bought a Auto care coupon and they would give me an appointment for oil change 4 months out and not sooner. That's craze. I would not recommend anyone using their services<//Text>

We like a lot hanging out. Yesterday we went to this magnificent restaurant which we didn’t know before. We passed a beautiful time there with exceptional food and a professional team and a distinguished cook. We put this restaurant in our list  and we will certainly return very soon. We highly recommend.</Text>

<Review>I ordered 3 entrees togo 1 fish and 2 shrimp, when i got home and opened the boxes first thing i noticed was how small the portions were considering the price. The spicy shrimp was ok and so was the fish but the big problem was the fried shrimp i got for my son which was way under cooked almost still raw, i don't plan on going back this was an expensive terrible experience.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>The service was fast and accurate. Our waiter made several rounds to make sure that everyone in our group of 12 was being taken care of. I would definitely recommend this place and their food. Order their tacos, they're very good.<//text>< resp>

<Text>Came in for on a Saturday Morning because I was craving some Caldo de Camaron and I was not disappointed. The soup was delicious and the corn tortillas were good too! Highly recommend to pay them a visit. Staff is very friendly and on point. New favorite spot dine in South Gate. Will be back during the evening to get a Michelada< /Text>< pics>

Birria with beans and rice? 🤢 tasted more like boiled beef. No flavor. This is not Mexican food. $5.00 agua fresca? Wow! Increíble. Never going back there. I’m Mexican, I know what Mexican food tastes like.<//Text>

Oh I love coming to this place, one of my favorite things to come here for is the shrimp ceviche and the cucumber drink they have available. It is always fresh and so delicious. Staff is friendly, places always clean, parking is always available and super convenient located right off the freeway.</Review>

The music was too loud for us. I don't like tuba except in marching bands, sorry. Service was great which is the whole reason for 3 stars. I think they need a new cook. My husband did not like anything on his plate, especially the fish and he loves fish. The broccoli on his plate was old and brown. My enchiladas weren't bad, just very bland.< /text>

<Review>This place was so good. Walking in, everything is beautiful, its clean, amazingly designed, you can tell the owners invested a lot of time and money to make the restaurant as great as possible. The staff was super welcoming and friendly, the wait for the food wasn't bad at all and the food itself was delicious! I highly recommend this place to all seafood and Mexican food lovers.</Review><Time>1483314782057<//Time>< resp>

The sauce on the chile was good and the rice and beans were tasty. I had that with a side of (red) chilaquiles that were perfectly crunchy and saucy. My tastebuds were going crazy! All i could think (cause i'm a fatty) was: I can't waitto come back here and have this again and that i have to bring my dad  and mother here for lunch! On my second visit my meal was extremely salty! Might be hit and miss depending on who the cook is (?????????) I'll have to go s third time and update my review then< /review>< date>

Food is delicious. Try the Molcajete for two (it was enough for 4 people with appetizers). They charge for fountain drink refills, not mentioned in the menu.< /review>

This is a hidden Gem in South Gate/Hollydale CA . They have the best pepino non alcoholic refresher .  Great customer service by everyone, great food and plenty of parking . During the weekend they do have live music, I want to say Their breakfast menu is the best . Let’s support small business like this one :)</Review>

Food was ok.We had a kids breakfast, and grilled cheese.To drink I ordered an horchata that came in a huge glass..I thought that was too much but oh well, drank half.Also, ordered a wet burrito(that comes with a salad for starters😺never seen that before) and a tostada mixta.Tortilla on burrito was hard as a rock, difficult to cut thru..And shrimp on tostada looked odd, Had a few bites had to use the bathroom right away, didnt think anything of it..as soon as I got home I had to rush to the bathroom..then two more times!! I  had to take something for the horrible pain..just felt horrible! I wont be going back there and to others that decide to try the place don't do the mixta tostada.<//text>

Not crazy about what I had, the shrimp, pulpo and other stuff inside a grilled pineapple. Would not order it again and most likely won't be back anytime soon. Seems expensive to me. Good service and the place was clean and attractively decorated, tho...</review>

(Translated by Google) Bottom line: this place is EXPENSIVE and LOVELY FOOD. Incredible !, a glass of flavored water costs 5 dollars !!! If you ask me if I would return? ... ever !!!
Terrible imitation of Mexican food.

<review>(Translated by Google) The place is very small, and there is only one bathroom for the whole restaurant, normal food, nothing spectacular but I went with friends and all of us when we made the order were clear in what we wanted were 5 people, from 5 to 3 they brought us We asked for a 30 minute wait for the food, we asked them to change the plate and they did not bring it back badly to 2 of the 3, very bad service, I asked for a mineral water with salt and lemon and they did not have In the end, they brought me a bottle and they told me that those were not for sale, that they were from the boss and that I practically did not ask for more because there was no more, that will take care of it because it was the boss's, as if they were doing me a favor, in the end, I'm never going to go

El lugar es muy pequeño,  y solo hay un baño para todo el restaurante,  la comida lo normal, nada espectacular  pero fuí con amigos y todos al hacer la orden fuimos claros en lo que queríamos eramos 5 personas, de las 5 a tres nos trajeron mal lo que pedimos, en una espera de 30 min por la comida,  pedimos que nos cambiaran el plato y no lo volvieron a traer mal a 2 de los 3 , muy mal servicio,  pedí un agua mineral con sal y limón y no tenían ni idea de como era, me la trajeron sin gas y sabia a agua de la llave , era de maquina y muy mal calibrada , al final me trajeron una de botella y me aclararon que esas no estaban a la venta , que eran del jefe y que prácticamente no pidiera más porque ya no había más,  que la cuidará porque era del jefe, como si me estuvieran haciendo un favor,  en fín , pésimo no vuelvo a ir<//review>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Delicious food, I like the fresh water of cucumber, lemon and chia, very tasty, nutritious and a good glass size ... the only thing is that it took them a while to bring the food and we were already hungry.

I love getting my eyebrows threaded here. This place is such a hidden gem. I have been getting my eyebrows threaded here for close to 3 years. All of the girls who work here are really sweet and nice. They are amazing! Quality has stayed consistent, it’s no wonder why they get busy. They take their time and do a great job. You might have to wait a bit but it’s so worth it! I cannot recommend this place enough.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Been coming here since 2015 almost 6 years! I have 2 reviews on Yelp. Don't mind doing another considering due to covid it's handled differently of course. Only 3 customers are allowed to be inside. Once you enter you can add your name and number as well as what service you will be getting (optional of course) they will notify you either call or text once it's your turn. They disinfect after every customer. Since I've been coming here the owner has been working non stop especially during the holidays. Customer service is always extraordinary, they always ask first how you would like them before starting unless they already know. I always make sure to tip extra when I'm able to because she deserves it. Yes sometimes there is a wait but that just proves that it's worth it. I've seen people call ahead to see if there is a line. I've done that a time or two myself. Super friendly all around.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I love this place. I travel all the way from Downtown l.a. just to get my eyebrows threaded and tinted. I also get facials at times. This place is well worth my drive. I wouldn't go anywhere else.<//text>

I loved my experience here. Mita took the time to make sure she satisfied my expectations. Not only were my brows great, but the massage of the forehead and eyebrow area were unexpected but appreciated. I was very relaxed. I will definitely be back.< /Text>

<Text>My eyebrows were jacked up from the over tweezing, and she did an amazing job! Better that what I would’ve done myself or anyone out there , she took her time and asked if I was ok, and gave me  a great massage when she was done !

Oh my goodness! Today was my first time (7/5/15). This is such a clean place that does a great job. I love that the process wasn't rushed and felt like a value costumer. Another place in Paramount had jacked up my eyebrows so getting them done again was not easy for me. There is only one lady; AWESOME! My eyebrows match and my face is alive lol .. I will be returning and bring others with me ☺ thanks again

<name>Debra Evans<//name><pics>None<//pics><text>My daughter and I switched eyebrow threaders, because of many bad experiences.  I found Sneha's Beauty Threading on Google.  I read the ratings, and we decided to give it a try.  I'm sure glad we did, it was a bit of a wait, but we'll worth it.  We were treated very nice and the threading was perfect, such a great experience!  Yes we will return, and I recommend Sneha's to everyone.<//text><userid>102218573060342610900</userid><rate>5< /rate></record>

My wife and I went to Riverside BMW just to look at different models, we had no intention of buying at that time. As we arrived we were met by John  Teasdale who offered to show us the different models. After looking at a few models and deciding on a 3 series we were about to excuse ourselves and we came across a 5 series that was a lease trade in. The 5 series was very nicely equipped and beautifully taken care of. We immediately decided to purchase that auto. The location recess was simple, zero pressure and extremely friendly employees, especially John. I was a great experience, I highly recommended Riverside BMW and John Teasdale.<//Review>

Do not buy a car from this dealer unless you live within a few miles of the dealership.

I have never experienced such terrible customer service.. the shocker is that they are a BMW dealer so we expected so much more. What a disappointment.

To start with we were out of state buyers. They do not like out of state buyers because apparently it is too much work. We were very surprised - as was BMW USA. We have purchased cars from out of state before and even shipped a car from Hawaii and never had any issues.

My Dad worked a car dealership for over 30 years. Every customer had value and out of state buyers were a large part of their business. Considering BMW does not have a presence in smaller communities, selling cars to people who are not local shouldn't be a new thing; it seems a bit discriminatory as well.

They FINALLY agreed to sell us the car....after weeks of hassle. Then we could not get them to send any paperwork or the shipping information.
We asked, and asked - to no avail. They requested and received our cashier's check - issued directly from the banks account. Cashier's checks are equal to cash where I am from, but this was like the Twilight Zone because they held up the deal for another 10 days while the check "cleared their account."

They also refused to sell us the car if there was a lienholder...apparently it was too much paperwork. Cash deals only if you live out of state.

Still no paperwork, no shipping information...no car. At this point we were six weeks into this all-consuming hassle. We tried to remain friendly and professional , but things had gotten really ridiculous.
Request after request for shipping information only to be told they were working on it. Their constant excuse for the lack of timeliness? "That is why we don't sell to out of state buyers."

Absolutely shocking.

I noticed that they like to discredit people who post bad reviews so for the record:
My daughter was the person trying to purchase this car, Riverside BMW agree to sell it to her and happily took her money.......this is called a CONTRACT.

This is a legitimate review - I generally do not write bad reviews because it is unfortunate that people always choose to complain and not compliment. This business has not earned the one star that I gave them - I wish I could give them zero stars but unfortunately that is not possible.

...The car finally showed up last Thursday....approximately 2 months after her first conversation with the dealer.< /Text>

< review>
I purchased my BMW from this dealership and have had it serviced here multiple times. Every advisor I've had was always helpful and made me feel welcomed. As such, both my wife and I were appalled by the behavior of the advisor from our service appointment yesterday. What started as a normal phone call about the details from the vehicle diagnostics, ended with him yelling at my wife and hanging up on us. My wife got in contact with the service manager today to try to resolve to issue, but was treated with a dismissive attitude again.

TL,DR: Be prepared to deal with some service advisors, including the manager, who will not give a damn about helping you.</review>

Horrible customer service my advisor did not answer my calls. first time they had me pay a diagnostics fee and sent me on my way car wasn’t fixed brought it back the next day told me it would be $1000 to fix, Car was in their shop for a week gave me a call back saying the check engine light turned on that wasn’t on as asking for another diagnosis when I left a bad review I got a call from my same advisor telling me “to take it down or give them a 5 star” and now I have many problems that where never there in the first place!<//Text>

We did an online purchase and the Manager (Edwin) was incredibly helpful and professional. Handled all my questions and needs in a timely and efficient manner. Then, the salesman (JR) coordinated delivery of our car 120 miles to our home.
The overall experience from BMW Riverside surpassed my expectations and we look forward to maintaining future business.
I highly recommend this dealership.<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely the WORST experience I have ever had with a dealership. I have leased 3 Mercedes Benz and 2 BMW’s before, and I have never experienced such a rip off. I scheduled an appointment to turn in my lease – and the inspection guy came back saying only “One” tire is below the thread; which I don’t understand how can a car drive on only ONE tire without wearing out at least the tire right next to it. Not to mention, I returned the car with only 32K Miles, which is 4K BELOW the limit set for the 3 year Lease Term.

Then the inspection guy said there is a “Dent” at the lower front bumper. As you can see from the pictures, the car is SPOTLESS. I never return a car that has any issues. I was pretty sure that the car had no issues, so I ask the guy to show me the “Dent”. We go, and he points to a little worn-out paint, that is the size of less than a quarter of an inch. So I tell him, first of all this is not a dent. It is a worn out paint. So it is BMW’s paint peeling off, within less than 3 years/32K Miles. So how is this my fault? Shouldn’t this be under Warranty to begin with? The inspection guy kept saying “Sorry that was a bad choice of words, I didn’t mean to say Dent, I meant to say paint pealing off”. I repeated again, how is that my fault that your paint is peeling off, and I have to pay for it? He kept saying that “I’m only doing my job and that’s what the dealership trained me to do”. Needless to say, I was so frustrated, I kept arguing with him to no point, and at the end I was charged $808.13.

$300 for the Tire Replacement, and $100 for the Paint Peeling on top of the $350 Disposition Fee. I then receive a bill in the mail, and they are charging Sales Tax on the Disposition Fee as well, which is incorrect. There is no Sales Tax on a FEE! I will never go back to this dealership ever again, and if you want any further proof of them not taking responsibility for anything, just read their responses to negative customer reviews. It always starts with “While disappointed that you are dissatisfied…. HOWEVER, it is your fault because blah blah blah”. They don’t respond like most decent companies, where they actually take responsibility, apologize, work out a resolution with customers, or AT LEAST try to care.</Text>< pictures>

Soooo.... I had a reading of a right brake light malfunction on my beloved BMW 435i, aka, the Weekend Whip. Fabian Hernandez was assigned as my Aftersales Consultant.

Mr. Hernandez was probably the absolute best representative of any car maintenance situation I have ever encountered. "How do you mean?” you ask. For me, going to the dealership, any dealership for ANY reason brings me a dark shade of red-zoned anxiety. Note that this is my third BMW. Also note that it's the car, not the people, that keep me laced in the comforts of these ultimate driving machines. This day was different. For starters, Mr. Hernandez was respectful, smiled (seems to be a lost art), explained then confirmed that I understood what he shared without being condescending or rushed (and away went round one of my anxiety). His follow-up was very commendable as well (the Weekend Whip stayed overnight) - pleasant, detailed voice mail and texts to keep me updated on the progress of the repair. Now, you may be thinking, "That's what an Aftersales Consultant is *supposed* to do". Yeah, but many of you know that is definitely not always the case.

My Sweetie, who drives something comparably a few pegs below interesting, came along and let me know throughout the appointment that the level of service and attention far exceeded his expectations. He was right.

The second round of my anxiety was dismissed when Mr. Hernandez shared the good and great news that the warranty covered my repair. Something out of his control of influence, but I give him credit for being the messenger.

A shout out to BMW of Riverside. Thank you for good and great service.

Absolutely one of the worst experiences I have had with getting a new BMW. This was the first time I had used BMW of Riverside and will never do business there again. I have had many BMW’s such as 7 Series, M6, M3 and more from other dealers and have always had a good experience from other dealers.
I got a brand new X7 for my wife and the vehicle was delivered to us at night. So, I couldn’t really see the vehicle and was the first time that I had seen it. I signed the paperwork and the salesperson left and my wife took it for a drive. When we got back and pulled it into the garage and had it under the light I saw scratches all over a BRAND NEW X7. The detail department that washed it had used a buffer on it and there were scratches EVERYWHERE! You could see where the buffer went across the paint.
Contacted them and took it back in and they were just going to give it back to the guys that had originally done it in their detail department. I did not want to take the chance of them screwing it up even more and declined and decided to take it to a professional for paint correction which I would have to pay out of my pocket! I have never got a brand new vehicle that had so many scratches and looked so horrible! You can see in the pictures.
On top of that, due to COVID we both work from home and hadn’t driven the vehicle and had taken it out the following week and noticed that there was a huge dent on the tailgate right by the BMW roundel. I was told that because it had been a week and a half that they would not take responsibility for this. I was severely mad about this because this absolutely positively 110% HAPPENED AT THE DEALERSHIP! We hadn’t barely even driven the car!
I then had to pay out of pocket for a Paintless Dent Repair person to come out and fix it because the dealership wouldn’t take responsibility which they absolutely should have!
Again, absolutely THE WORST experience I have ever had buying a new car! I will NEVER DO BUSINESS with BMW of RIVERSIDE and will make sure that everyone I know will not go there either!< /Review>

< Review>
BMW Of Riverside has been fantastic. Both my husband and I have gotten our cars from there instead of our local dealer. We dealt with Nader the sales manager and Dylan and Marc as our sales people. They treat us like VIPs, and they have always given us their best price first so we don't have to haggle. We are happy to make the drive out there so that we can have an experience like we have had at BMW Of Riverside.<//Review>

I will make sure to service my car and make purchase at a different location. It’s sad that riverside cannot have the same luxury service as other city’s.

Long story short, scheduled a service only to wait for a loner car, although I schedule everything in advance. After waiting 1 hour we were told it would be another 30 minutes wait.

We ended up leaving since we had other things scheduled. What a waste of a day.</Review>< pics>

I called in to get an appointment to do an oil change the lady on the phone told me it will take almost an hour to do it therefore I didn’t take any ride or anybody to pick me up..
When I went there the guy in front told me it will take up to four hours I told him with the lady told me he gave me that look as if I’m lying to him
I told him I cannot wait here for four hours otherwise I would’ve brought somebody to pick me up right away he he gave me the papers back the keys without saying a word
I went to his manager to tell him what happened his manager attitude was even worse he told me impossible that someone will tell you it will take just that short of a time to do an oil change
All my life is been BMW owner but I never ever seen treatment or attitude like this
And of course will never go back neither for service or to buy anything from them</Text>

The only dealer in a 50 mile radius that would negotiate. They are very attentive and take care of their customers. My previous vehicle was from their sister company Riverside Chevrolet and I had the same awesome experience and the best deal again. It must be a company philosophy because the Chevy dealer near my own backyard would not negotiate a dime either and acted like they were doing me some kind of favor if they sold me a vehicle. The drive for me was worth it because I saved a bundle, my salesman Gil was great and they went out of their way to take care of me even offering to come pick me up 20 miles away! My wife is extremely happy and I will be back to them for every BMW from now on!<//text>

BMW service in Riverside has always done a great job when I’ve taken my 750 LI in for service.
Service rep,  Daisy Keene is the best, not only was she knowledgeable about parts needed but she notified me in a timely manner so I could make future  plans in my daily schedule.  She also provided me with a BMW courtesy vehicle for 4 days which I greatly appreciated.
A BIG thanks to BMW in Riverside and especially to Daisy Keene!!

Sincerely,
Alan Robison</review>

I've been coming to BMW of Riverside since even before they built their fancy new digs and I'll keep coming back to them. Part of it is definitely because they're closest in proximity, but the other part is definitely because they're great at customer service. I've brought numerous cars in and my SA, Andrew Garcia, has always taken great care of me and my family's needs. He always looks out for what is best and will tell me if some suggested items can wait if necessary. I'll continue to come and utilize BMW of Riverside anytime I need a new car or a new oil change. I heartily recommend.< /Text>

I went to get an oil change and me being a first time BMW owner, I wanted to make sure that the oil change was done correctly.  Since the car was a 25 years old Z3 I had recently bought second hand I of course took my car to BMW of Riverside for them to do the oil change along with their normal inspection of cars whenever you bring it in for service. They told me that the car would be done after about 2 hours but they finished way faster than the 2 hour estimate they gave. By the end I was ready to pay and they told me there is no charge, when I asked who do I have to thank they told me it was just covered under my warranty. I don't know how that is possible being that the car has over 160,000 miles and is over 25 years old but. I just want to say thank you so much BMW of Riverside, you guys are amazing from the employee that came up to me and started talking to me saying that she used to have the same car (I unfortunately did not get her name), to Daisy, to Ryan, and all of the service technicians.

I leased a 2020 BMW 330i from BMW of Riverside, which was a previous loaner vehicle. I went through a car broker to lease this vehicle and the vehicle was delivered to my home in Sylmar, CA, by a dealer staff (~80 miles). I was very excited when I received the vehicle and so to my disadvantage, I did not do a thorough inspection before signing my paperwork, and being a workday, I only took it around the block (<0.5 mile) and immediately parked it in my garage.

The following day I had a better look at the vehicle, inside and out, and noted a few faults. 1) The windshield had a crack; 2) there was hot glue-like stains in the center console area (3 specific areas – including the shift knob); 3) a speaker sounded busted; 4) both front wheels had curb damage but were repaired by the dealer (poorly).

I reached out to the broker and asked about issues 1, 2, and 3. He said he will get in touch with the dealer. BMW of Riverside told my broker to take the vehicle in to inspect the issues. I scheduled an appointment and took the vehicle in. The dealer fixed the speaker issue (3) under warranty and said if I wanted the windshield (1) and console stains (2) fixed, it would be charged to me at a price of $2,500 and $1,600, respectively. They are trying to put these damages on me stating it passed inspection before being delivered to me.

To note, I saw two dealer employees inspect my vehicle before accepting it in for service and neither noted the issues until I pointed them out. I am not saying that staff is incompetent, but I noted that they are not thorough.

I am very disappointed how this dealer has and is treating a loyal customer by blaming their mistakes on me and will never shop at BMW of Riverside again and will encourage all of my friends and family the same.<//text>

They ensured that all of my needs were met to get into a new lease for my new car.  I had been a loyal customer of a dealership close to my home in Los Angeles but unfortunately, their unwillingness to work with my needs allowed me to explore what BMW of Riverside had to offer.  In the future, Riverside will be my first call and first choice when getting a new BMW.  The day of the purchase, I was in and out with no hassle, no bait and switch like another dealership tried to do in the past.  Everyone wore masks and ensured my safety was a priority.

I can't thank Michael Montoya enough for reaching out and making sure I was treated like an important customer.  Also, JR and Edwin Sarhad for following up and making sure that I didn't feel like my business was being forgotten.  You all make a great team.  I wish you much success.

I've had some very painless and pleasant car buying experiences but this one is by far the best and easiest.  Thank you so much and I hope to see you in a couple years.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The Service department at BMW of Riverside delivers impeccable service time and time again.  This service team has gone out of their way to put the customer (me) first.  I had a situation occur with one of their recommended warranty company, who put up a fight when it came time to cover a claim on my vehicle.  Thanks to the team at BMW of Riverside, they ensured the resolution provide to I (the customer) exceeded my expectations.  Anthony my service advisor did what was right and needed to bring this matter to a prompt and satisfactory resolution.  Thanks Anthony for always taking care of my family and my needs.<//review>

We recently purchased our 330i from Riverside BMW. Amazing customer service! Oscar greeted us upon our arrival and was absolutely outstanding!

He is a consummate professional! The transaction  quoted on the phone was exactly the amount that Oscar said it would be when we arrived.

I also had an opportunity to speak with Antony Chandler GM at BMW Riverside. Great guy who fully understands long term relationships eg very customer focused!

We will definitely continue to purchase our future BMWs from BMW of Riverside.</review>

<Text>Great service experience the dealership was like I pulled into the pits of an Indy 500 race one person greeted me immediately as I pulled in and opened up my wife's door a second did a vehicle inspection to make sure there was any damage or pre-existing issues The service advisor Daisy greeted us halfway to her desk she went over our issues documented everything walked us to their free loaner car desk and the whole process took approximately 15 minutes and we drove away in a brand new BMW. The only downside is now my wife wants to trade in our 2016 BMW for a new one like they loaned us.< /Text>< rate>

Every one here is super welcoming, friendly, and professional. They are not pushy. They will allow you to walk around, and actually look at cars, without a salesman looking over your shoulder. My 13 year old son loves cars. His idea of a perfect day is looking at cars. I loathe dealerships because most do not let you just look. This place is the exception. We also purchased a few items from the store. The lady that helped us was very helpful.</review>

If I could give this place zero stars I definitely would. I visited this location after graduating from grad school, hoping to get some insight on attaining my dream car. The first thing that threw me off is when I walked in the sales man stated, “I guess I’ll help you since he’s sitting down.” That’s  definitely not how you greet a customer “I guess I’ll help you”. The salesman made me feel unwelcome and embarrassed to had even walked through the doors, I wasn’t taken seriously from the jump. The car that I was looking at purchasing was way out my price range but the way that I was delivered that information was rude and disrespectful, when I tried to ask further questions he began talking over me. I wasn’t even offered to look at different cars. I left there crying, and contacted the manager to explain my experience. The manager DID call me back but I felt I shouldn't give someone my business and money after being treated so poorly so I never went back. I went to BMW of Ontario and got WAY better service. I was greeted by everyone and I felt welcomed unlike BMW of Riverside. The salesman offered me multiple options of vehicles I qualified for and I gave THEM my business instead. BMW of Ontario helped my obtain my dream
car, I was able to treat myself after graduating from grad school. Definitely will never recommend this place to anyone .<//Review>

I've purchased 3 vehicles from them in the past fifteen years and every time I've received 5 star service.  Christopher Sharp has always went above and beyond for me. If I'm having issues in the service department the sales manager always makes sure they take care of me.<//Text>

<Text>Brought my car in for a recall, and a diagnosis, recall and diagnosis were done in the same day, despite saying how busy they were. Justin Christian had helped me out, and kept me updated on things. Not only that, the whole group of staff that I interacted with were pleasant and very professional. Four star simply because of dealership prices, not any of the employees I interacted with! All in all, great experience.< /Text>< GmapID>

Mr. Decker did an excellent job with all aspects of my car purchase, representing the BMW brand very well. He was straightforward, extremely knowledgeable, and fully attentive to any issues and follow-up questions that I had.
Putting bow on at delivery was a fun touch!<//Review>

Leased my first BMW through Riverside Dealership. Larry Winkler was an absolute delight to work with. No hassle, no BS on going back and forth, very respectful and fun to work with. Got an amazing quote and picked up the car in less than 24 hours. Definitely recommend for anyone who is shopping around for a Bimmer!</text>

Each time I take my X1 into BMW of Riverside's service department they meet or exceed my expectations.  The latest trip was because my interior brake light came on, indicating my brake pads were wearing down to the point of concern.  I didn't know if it was only the front pads, the rear, or both.  Service advisor, Fabian, sent me a quote to fix the front and rear pads, if needed.  He was off the day I arrived, but service advisor, Eddie, honored the quote.  As my car was being serviced, he came into the customer lounge to let me now that the rear pads were in good shape and didn't need replacing.  I appreciated his (and the mechanic's) honesty.  This wouldn't be the case at some dealerships.  I find BMW of Riverside to be very fair and work with integrity in all they do.  Top notch.< /text>

My original appointment was with Andrew Garcia (Service Advisor).  I have always been a conscientious consumer and I’m all about the service that is provided and I insist in getting the service that I or the car deserve.  Well, Andrew has not disappointed. He goes above and beyond to ensure that I’m satisfied in every aspect.  I hope that all BMW of Riverside is trained to attend people as well as Andrew does.  If it weren’t for him, I’m not sure where I would have my car serviced.  I rated BMW of Riverside with 5 Stars because of the manner in which Andrew Garcia has treated me over the course of the last six years.  Thank you Andrew!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>I contacted about seven other dealerships trying to find a good deal on a 2020 330i. I have to say that BMW of Riverside really stepped up to help find the best deal possible. I worked with Dylan Barnes and he was absolutely amazing in helping me find the exact car with all the features I wanted plus more and helped me get an amazing deal! This dealership really works with all their customers, a few of my family friends got their BMW’s from here too and they have nothing but great things to say about the people that work here.<//Review>< pics>

I am very impressed. The service department personnel are fantastic. Welcoming and informative every time.  I love when you take your vehicle in to check on something/anything they look ahead and let you know what’s due soon for preventative maintenance and let you know if you would like to leave the car, they would be happy to take care of these items while you were here or provide a courtesy vehicle for your use.<//review>

Recommend: Luis Guzman

BMW Riverside helped me with the car I was looking for online. Luis was friendly, honest, gave me a good detail report of the car, test ride, helped me getting my financing done right, and even threw in a Cappuccino.

BMW financing is the best (in my personal view). They helped me find the right loans with low Interest rate and I was even a first time buyer.

Check out BMW Riverside, you won’t be disappointed.

Thank you guys!<//Text>

Nestor was extremely friendly and overall a good person who dealt with any issues that came up during the whole process. The car was repaired perfectly with no issues so far. The only minor negative was that the process did take much longer than they had stated when I asked for updates, so have a backup plan.

Very professional team members doing their best to provide an excellent customer service. A type of service you may hardly fine in big cities like LA. I had a unique experience with Mr. Jesse Meza. He went above and beyond to find me a great deal. His patience and caring personality amazed me. He doesn’t give up and is willing to go great lengths to please and help you. I strongly recommend this dealership!< /review>

Great place to buy a car!  From test drive, pricing to finance- great people! Larry W was the best!  Best salesman that didn't talk too much but just enough to give ALL the details and perks of the car.  My test drive was the most thorough I have ever taken.  He is 100% a gifted salesman and knows what do and highlight the right stuff.  If I could only adjust to this modern technology these new cars offer!  Unbelievable :)<//Review>

I purchased my new car from BMW Riverside in last month.
This is my second time to deal with BMW dealership, and it is the best experience ever.
My coworker referral BMW Riverside to me, said all of the people are nice and helpful. Jesse was helping me since I was request a quota via email, until the end of the purchase. During the whole process, he was really helpful and professional, even I have a dozen of questions, he still very patient to listen and help.  I will referring my family and friend to this nice place.
Thank you Jesse and the lady who helping to explain my X1 functions... (sorry forgot her name, she is nice!)</Review>

All we ask is a fair deal. If there's an advertisement, honor it. Riverside BMW went above and beyond to give us a great deal. BMW has the advantage of a superior product, but what sets them apart is their superior treatment of customers.</text>

Think-ahead level of service. Extremely kind and respectful of my time. Zero drama. Easy. A vehicle can be bought pretty much anywhere, but what comes after and for the duration of ownership is what matters and sets this place apart. Obviously I highly recommend.</review>

I had leased a BMW i3, and in the lease contract - as with all my other BMW leases, it states I can return the car to any dealer.

I even went and got a lease pre-inspection a month earlier by BMW Riverside.  No issues, no charges, under mileage.  The person inspecting it, as well as a salesperson said I could return it at any time before my lease expired.

I returned and was told that they only accept leases from customers who had bought a car through them.  I asked for the Manager and Nader Zekira refused to take my car back - though my BMW contract says I may return it to any dealer?

He blamed "COVID" and lack of real estate, but if I bought a car from him, he'd take it back.  This is the type of slimy tactics this dealership is known for, my neighbor tried to get a warranty repair from this dealer and had to go to BMWUSA to force them to approve it.

Do not go to this dealer for sales or service.  Shady!<//text>

I’ve been coming to BMW of Riverside for over five years. The service manager i usually go to was out on paternity leave so I was assigned to another one who shattered all my confidence in BMW. He recommended things but didn’t verify them on my car. The things he told me and the things that were written on my service receipt that I received after I picked up my car were completely different. Not only that, but they inspected my front brakes and then over torqued the bolt (i have spacers in the front and they didn’t pay attention to them) so now I need to get a new hub. Honestly, will never come back here again after this experience.< /Text>

<Review>Andrew, Service Advisor was extremely helpful with being in my car after a jump for a dead battery, even though no appointment. (Which would have been impossible.) it was mid afternoon, so no loaner cars were available and no transport home because of Covid! (Curses to this virus!) Car won’t be ready for at least 24 hours, so he called Lyft for me, and BMW took care of it! I do need to find my way back which will be difficult unless I contact Lyft, as I am a senior and live alone. Thank you for your help!<//Review>< Resp>

BMW service managers are awesome, but I have one small negative feedback.  We have brought our BMW here to be serviced more than once.  Had approximately $2000 worth of work done collectively.  However, we recently discovered that none of the repairs on our car was ever reported to CARFAX.  So, if you decide to get your car serviced at this location, they do not report for some reason. Therefore, I would not recommend bringing your vehicle here unless you ensure that they will report the repairs. This comment is for conscientious car owners who care  about having accuracies, just in case you want to trade in or sell your car.  if they had reported the repairs as expected, I would have given 5 stars.<//Text>

We are very  satisfied with BMW of Riverside.  Recently had an excellent experience with the re-financed of our vehicle and the services performed on it.  We purchased our car with the assistance of Gil, who was a great help in every way and now guidance in the re-finance process.  Gil and Nader the sales manager went above and beyond our expectations in providing the best customer service.  We highly recommend them.  Thanks again.  Ernest and Alice.< /text>

<Review>After being involved in a minor accident, I brought my car to the collision center at BMW of Riverside. From my first phone interaction until I picked up my car it was a 5 star experience. They arranged for my rental car and gave me information to make sure I got a luxury rental, kept in contact with me via phone and text, and went above and beyond to restore my car to  better than new. I am so pleased with my whole experience that I will never take my car anywhere else.

The service department is what really did it for me. They have text messages set in place for  communicating with your advisor (Anthony and Fabian), but those go unresponded for hours.The car is in their shop and I have been left stranded without a loner car for days now.
Also, their roadside assistance service was horrible.  Sergio was helping us for roadside and was rude and inconvenienced when we called. Didn’t even want to explain the process when it was our first time using it.  I wish they had a contact with AAA.
Just poor service overall. 10/10 would never recommend.</text>< Rate>

I was always kind of skeptical about purchasing a car online, especially living out of town. I purchased a pre owned Mercedes Benz, specific to what I wanted. I purchased my car from BMW of Riverside despite my skepticism and shipping charges to have it shipped Houston, Tx which was not cheap. To make a long story short, I only had one key that came with the car and after I paid my car off I called to ask for my spare keys only to get the run around and kept being told by BMW of Riverside Reps’ that they would call me back and I didn’t receive a call, message or spare keys. I assumed by doing business with a dealership that I would have a better experience only to be proven wrong! I earned every dollar spent on my purchase and paid it off free and clear not missing one payment and certainly did not call looking for a handout! Spare keys should not be a problem in fact this is the only vehicle I ever bought without spare keys! I know that’s some dealers keep spares incase a customer don’t make good on payments and I completely understand and respect that! Finally I didn’t have good customer service experience in the end. I wrote specifically for people looking to spend their hard earned money to be aware of questionable customer service! Now it’s time to move on!< /Text>

The service department here is very professional! Travis made sure that I was taken care of by providing me with a loaner vehicle and by keeping me up to date on the status of my vehicle. He was thorough with the details. My overall experience here was beyond my expectations! Will return if or when needed.<//Review>

BMW of Riverside was a great place and purchasing my car went flawlessly. Was instantly greeted at entrance offered beverages and connected with my salesmen Gil. No pressure sales and absolute pleasure to do business with. Gil showed me a few cars and found what I wanted he was an absolute help and answered any questions I had. Negotiations went well and walked out with my new ride! The car didn’t have the floor mats that I wanted and Gil ordered and shipped brand new Original BMW mats to my front door they do what they say they will and have earned my trust for my future purchases. I would highly recommend BMW of Riverside to any one looking to purchase a vehicle. Thank you for a great experience!<//text>

< Review>
I went to the dealership to take a look and get an idea,  assuming it was way out of my budget. Hugo was very understanding and Professional. He Helped me find the car that I liked and within my budget. I was amazed with what he did and the discount he was able to get me. Thanks to him, I now am a BMW owner 😊. I ordered some accessories and went to the parts department. Ryan was such a nice guy and made it so easy...it’s just a great brand and amazing dealership 👍</Review>

Riverside BMW is such a pleasant experience to deal with the buying process as well as any service related issues you may need for your car. You can clearly experience the difference of how you are treated at this dealership compared to any others that I have dealt with over the years. Your car gets a thorough inspection each time you visit and you leave with an appreciation and knowledge that everything is operational and safe. I believe I will be a customer for life.</Text>

I’m always thankful for the care I’m given at BMW of Riverside. I was disappointed this visit when I was told I was 10 days too early to get my windshield wipers replaced when I had my car serviced. This was an oil change and engine check appointment that BMW had called me to schedule. I live in Redlands and I was told to wait 10 days and then come in to get  them changed... oh and come back to get the car washed because it was too windy to provide the wash, it was not windy the day I picked my car up.< /text>
<Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1591980953178, 'text': "Hi Teri, thank you for your feedback. The manufacturer sets the guidelines for service intervals and replacement parts under the maintenance warranty plan. Because of this, they will not pay for any maintenance prior to the mileage or due dates. As for the car wash, last week we experienced multiple days of extreme wind and we were not washing vehicles during those days for the safety of our staff. Your opinion is very important to us, so please don't hesitate to contact me should you like to discuss any of this further.

BMW of Riverside always treats me as if I was their number one customer.  I am always treated with friendly and professional staff.  Anytime I have an issue or concern, I know I can call my service adviser, Jose anytime.  If he is not available, he makes sure someone else will take good care of me.  This is my 4th BMW and I look forward to staying with them, as I feel they offer the best service around!<//review>

Last weekend was my first visit to this dealership. From the time I called to inquire about a certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicle to the time I left with a beautiful, fully loaded, Alpine White X1 for my wife, I was treated with the upmost respect by my sales person Mr. Oscar Contreras and the rest of their leadership team, to include their GM.  Granted I know they wanted to earn my business, but their approach was extremely caring and sincere.  The dealership showroom is spot on clean and extremely modern. All vehicles on the lot are immaculate and the car I purchased for my wife was like new/very well cared for. Our purchase price was below market and we received an excellent interest rate through BMW financial. Overall I am extremely grateful for their service, especially since I am the type of person who refuses to purchase from dealers. This sales group truly earned my future business and I highly recommend them, especially Oscar, to anyone shopping for a new or CPO BMW. Well done BMW of Riverside!!< /Text>

I originally purchased my BMW here and since have always taken my car here for maintenance. Their customer service is always their top priority. I’ve taken my car to other BMW dealerships when I’ve had to but none compare to BMW of Riverside. My mom is currently in the market to purchase a BMW and she is planning to purchase it from Riverside. I also plan to buy another BMW next year and will again buy from this dealership.  I highly recommend BMW of Riverside!<//Review>

Compelled to express how disappointed I am with the way my problem was handled.  I was dismissed unprofessionally by one of the staff not knowing I still have other concerns.  His point was that he had explained everything there is to explain and that I need to move on and get over it, to that effect.  This was not his tune a year ago when he sold me the extended warranty which cost me $6K.  He said it must be a misunderstanding on my part as he is certain he explained everything to me.  Perhaps I did since I don't have any knowledge of what is covered or not but to dismiss me like, "If you don't have any other questions you can leave as your advisor has other customers to attend to" is cold.  All my previous transactions were pretty straight forward for the past 6 years until today.  I understand BMW is a luxury brand and I put every hard earned penny I have to maintain this car.  I love BMW but might have to switch to something else after this incident.

< review>
Had my best experience thus far at a BMW service center.  They were fast, addressed all of the issues I asked them to look into, and I didn't feel like they tried to haggle me to save money on their end.  Grateful for this experience and will be back in the future.</review>

<text>Went in to test drive a 2019 Z4. Sales person was very pleasant. But when it came to discussing the price with the sales & finance manager involved, that was another story. I asked for their best price and when the sales person returned he had a spec sheet that included a $5k dealer premium. First off the car is listed on Auto Trader with out the dealer premium. In my opinion to send a sales person back with a dealer premium is not a good sign that you are dealing with a reputable dealer. I thanked him for his time and wanted to leave. He asked that I wait for him to let the sales mgr know my response.  Then he returned with finance mgr, I expressed my concern at which time the finance mgr in my opinion belittled the sales person. Then he went on to say this is how they would open negotiations. I restated that I had asked for their best price and they sent the sales person back with full sticker with a $5k premium. At that point I stated that I was not confident in them as a reputable dealer and left.</text>< Resp>

Mark Decker at Riverside BMW made this buying experience effortless.  We exchanged a few emails prior to me coming in and he helped my son and I pick the perfect car for our family.  Additionally, he followed up with me a few times after the transaction, just to make sure I was happy.  I also want to point out the Olympic Track Star who happens to be your finance manager.  He shared a few stories and made us laugh while we tackled the paperwork (Great Guy).  Thanks for all the help...<//review>

<Review>I have done business with Riverside BMW for almost 15 years. They are very courteous, professional, and really help you though the process of buying, leasing etc. Rather its, sales, maintenance, or parts I have always had the best experience.  If you are looking to purchase a new BMW ask for Jamel Ward. He made my recent experience a pleasure.  Sometimes buying a car can be stressful, but with Jamel we laughed and joked as we were getting financing done, which took the edge off. Thanks Riverside BMW once again for making my experience a pleasure.<//Review>< user_id>

Fabian Hernandez is an absolutely wonderful service adviser.   He explains everything that is being done to my vehicle, and advises me as to whether there is a cost and what he believes that cost will be.  My car is always returned to me in clean condition.  If I have questions,  he has no problem answering my questions.  I have had three BMW vehicles and have had nothing but great experiences with all three,<//Text>

Update: I have changed my review from 2 stars to 4 stars thank you to Tiffany & Fabian in the service department. Tiffany has a great attitude all around & she genuinely cares about more than just a paycheck! Fabian is a hard worker & he is always very helpful & polite. The service department is outstanding. They offer the best service & are always friendly & willing to help. HOWEVER, I have not been pleased with the sales department.< /Review>

Once again BMW of Riverside is the best!  Went in yesterday to service our x1, from general managers Charles Hughes and Anthony Chandler to salesman Jamil Razzak to service rep Ryan the experience was seamless, and stress free!  I've bought a lot of cars from a lot of dealers over the years but for the past 20 it's Riverside BMW only!<//Review>

I have been here only a couple times since I am pretty new to the BMW family but I have a couple things to say about this dealership! Robert in the service department is so amazing! He provided amazing customer service and in a timely manner. He was extremely polite and although I’m sure all the service personnel are just as great, I plan to schedule all my future appointments with Robert because I was just that impressed by him. My first visit he made sure to show me around and graciously pointed me to all the yummy cookies and coffee available for waiting customers. My car has been returned freshly washed to me each time and ready to go for a spin! 🚙💨 Next, at my initial visit Robert kindly referred me over to Nevan for an extended care package for my car. Nevan was so helpful and transparent about what I would be paying and what services would be included. He really worked with me to make sure I got the best package for me and my needs! I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone and will continue to come here for all my future needs!

One last thing! The dealership smells AMAZING inside!<//text>

I took my car in for a simple repair. When I took my car home, I mistakenly thought that the repair hadn't been done properly. I received a survey from BMW North America a raised a big stink not realizing that I had made the mistake. My Service Advisor, Jose Meza, was aware that my review had been very negative, but you would never know it by the way he treated me. He was patient in reviewing what had been done, and he updated me throughout the day, and was a consummate professional. He's an asset for the dealership and I'm thankful to publicly recognize his good work.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My first lease (3 years ago) with BMW-Riverside (BMW-R), recently ended and though I live in a nearby city with a very good BMW dealership, I returned to BMW-R because of their attention to detail, willingness to provide competitive pricing, customer care and exceptional inventory.  Many thanks to ALL (a small group, right now) the hardworking individuals keeping this dealership not only viable, but moving forward in these extraordinary (COVID-19 pandemic) times. Sales manager Nader Zekria, received my initial inquiry and immediately set-out to provide clarity and comfort with a transaction that we both knew would be different, but still offer the same excellent customer support and care BMW-R provided on my first lease. Client adviser, Mark Decker contacted me to complete the documents and delivery with his "VIP green glove" service, keeping in touch through all the minor bumps along the way, as the transaction moved to closing. I could get used this VIP green glove home delivery of autos real easy! Mark made the transaction so effortless and as a knowledgeable BMW models expert, was aware of all the new features of my model and wasted no time educating me. As before, Jennifer Wright of finance promptly managed all of the money details, exhibiting patience and calm as I battled a besieged credit bureau to unfreeze my credit report! Whew, we made it and I all I can say is: "Thanks a million, BMW-R. See you again--in 3 years, if not sooner--that showroom is wonderful."< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Please contact Vincent Faulkner to purchase/lease your next BMW. This is my second vehicle purchased through BMW Riverside and each time he provided top notch service (not pushy, straightforward, and timely process). Once in the vehicle Travis Usary (might've butchered the last name) provided similar top notch service in the service department.< /review>

Fabian Hernandez, the Service Rep at BMW's dealership, is always providing great customer support. Unfortunately I had to bring my X5 into the dealership a few times to be serviced and each time Fabian made me feel welcomed and informed.
Overall, my experience at the BMW of Riverside is fantastic because Fabian makes sure his customers are taken of. Thank you.</review>

Updated Review.  internet purchase, responsive, thorough, helpful.  The car was detailed and shipped.  Everyone I dealt with was professional.  A great purchase experience.  Unfortunately,  upon closer examination the car arrived with several important elements missing, first aid kit, tools, one key FOB inop, vanes on the main panel broken, rear entertainment remote missing, all things that should have been checked in the CPO process.  I have shared with BMW Riverside with no response.  If you are buying over the internet, please have them confirm these details before purchasing.<//text>

Because of this, the repair would not be covered under warranty. I understand this was explained to you by our service team today but should you like any further clarification, please feel free to contact me. Regards, Antony Chandler - General Manager - customercare@bmwriverside.com"}<//Response>
<Text>My 9:00am appointment turned into another campaign to  rip a new customer off.  They had no shame about trying.  I had a error code in the seat belt system.  I was told over the phone that it would be covered under the warranty with no charge.  When I arrived my adviser purposely was busy and I was serviced by a bunch of other advisers. LOL.  Well the Oil change special that I was quoted was not available as stated with the scheduling of the appoint. Next to diagnose the problem it would be $189.00.  Well I asked the ad visor  why when my car was still under warranty. He stated it was not !! I stated that the factory warranty was still in affect.  He said oh you are right so just sign and if its a defect then I would not be charged. However, he said if they find that it was my fault then I would have to pay the $189.00 .   Well that was unprofessional,  the ad visor on the phone was really confident that it was a common warranty item.  Not only that the ad visor became irritated when I cross examine him about the facts so I cancelled and will go to another BMW dealer.  I lost total confidence right there on the spot. I did call BMW of America to verify that my car was in fact under warranty and the fix should be without any charge as it is a very common problem.  This is the second time this has happen to me the first situation has ended up in litigation and will settle soon as it was that bad. Warning !!  I expected to be ripped off by Pep Boys not BMW .  In fact Pep Boys service all my cars because not once have they been dishonest !!   I have filed a second report with BMW of America . The ad visor did not even check to see if the car was still under warranty and proceed to write-up charges.. He disclosed the charges just before I went to sign .... Next time someone should tell you before you make the trip there...

Follow up !! You are incorrect sir !!!    The ad visor did not even check to see if the car was under warranty .    BMW of Newport has since fixed the car and  states no diagnostic  fee should be for a car under warranty. BMW of America also stated a diagnostic fee should never be charged when a car is under warranty.  The Module has failed ( Its a known problem) and the battery has been replaced which can cause the computer to not reset it.  Your place of business should be avoided at all costs. You are no better then Pep Boys in fact your customer service could learn a thing or too from them as they ACCEPT good and bad feed back .

The car was fixed under warranty and I was giving the oil change free of cost because you all lied !!</Text></record></dataset><record>

From the moment you go into Riverside BMW everybody is fantastic. DAISY was so helpful on my last visit she is one amazing smart girl! Even the girls that work in the loaner department make everything so easy. The only girls that are not too pleasant are the girls that are at the checkout in the merchandise area. They Seem like they are not happy with their job they never say hello or crack a smile. But I guess they don’t like their job. I’ve worked CS forever and they have none. But the cookies are always delicious especially the oatmeal raisin. And I always make a iced latte togo. I’ve driven BMW over 30 years and I would never drive anything else.< /text>

I’ve been hearing a small clicking in my front wheel steering column even after having a repair done two months prior by BMW. Because of this noise I returned for further research and concerned. Andrew was there to investigate the problem and really took his time to reveal the noise I had been experiencing. Even though we didn’t bring out the noise as I had been hearing, Andrew did further research and found out that there was a recall for what I was experiencing.

Awesome service advisor Andrew is!!!!!!!!

This is the type of service that keeps me coming back to Riverside BMW Andrew brings to your dealership!!!

Thank you Andrew!

Sincerely.

Looked at the cars for sale and spoke to Michael Segura who was very friendly and helpful. Got my car back in the 2 hours that they told me it would take. Washed and running perfect.

<review>Wish I could give this team 100 stars! I’ve been bringing my cars here for a couple of years now and it’s always been very pleasant. Typical oil changes, tires rotations, the normal maintenance on my vehicles. A few weeks ago my turbo went out on my car. Dropped my car off on a Saturday and Travis immediately assisted me. Travis was great on communicating with me on updates on the repairs and would either text or call me to make sure I was kept in the loop of the car. All I had to give him was the phone number to the extended warranty and he handled the rest. Couldn’t of been more pleased, no cost for the loaner, no fees for the repair and most of all I am comfortable knowing that my car got repaired at a BMW dealership. You guys are awesome and got a customer for life!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>BMW of Riverside - What can I say? A lot!

BMW of Riverside - hands down, is a dealership and service center that definitely outshines the five star rating system. The customer service provided by the associates was by far the best I have ever received. Everyone I interacted with at BMW of Riverside was warm and welcoming, helpful and attentive, efficient and effective, professional and knowledgeable, courteous and empathetic - not to mention they were all some of the best looking representatives I have ever had the opportunity and pleasure to do business with. The service center, showroom, and lobby were all very well maintained and provided an excellent atmosphere and relaxing setting.

And that was all very much appreciated.  I had been sitting in my car in freezing cold weather and in the fog after running over some rocks that caused a lot of undercarriage damage to my vehicle. Alone, I waited for a tow truck to come up the mountain, almost six hours, and once one finally showed up, I felt like there was going to be more disaster and disappointment ahead.

I couldn’t have been more wrong! I was amazed at how quickly I was assisted at BMW of Riverside, and I was on my way home in less than an hour!

I arrived to the service center in a tow truck and tears and left in a brand new BMW 330i loaner with a smile on my face and feeling confident that everything would work out for the best.

And it did! Even though I hadn’t heard from my insurance company’s adjuster, I did receive a call from BMW of Riverside. They didn’t have an answer as to whether my insurance company would pay to have my car fixed or claim it as a total loss (which was not their fault, but due to a rescheduling made by the insurance company’s adjuster) but they still graciously allowed me to continue using the loaner car.

Fast forward two weeks (approximate) I returned the loaner and picked up my car which was ready, all due to the collaborative effort put forth between BMW of Riverside and StateFarm Insurance Company. I am happy to say that my car was completely repaired by professional BMW mechanics and to what I believe better condition than before!

Thank you BMW of Riverside!</Text>< Pics>

They took care of me in a timely manner. They said it would take 2 hours, but it was only about an hour. I had two recall airbags for my 2004 325i. The only problem was I had was they gave me a courtesy vehicle but had to put a pending hold of 50 dollars. It pended all weekend and didn't get it back till Wednesday morning. The vehicle wasn't even another BMW, it was a Toyota. Not too much of a problem, but a little bummed I didn't get another BMW.<//Text>

< review>
Horrible.... I bought an extended warranty on my vehicle but so far absolutely nothing has been covered. The time before this last one I was due for an oil change but had brought my car in for a different reason. They told me I was due for an oil change which made me think they were going to do it, they only did my other repair and gave me my car back with no oil change. I didn't have time to play games and I had already turned in the loaner car so I just decided I would do it later. This week I took my car in cause it was leaking oil. It turned out to be only the oil cap that goes near the oil filter..The guy who was helping us, Huu, wanted to charge me 1k to replace the supposed after market oil cap, oil change and clean the oil off the engine. When my husband refused service Huu became angry, sarcastic, and rude. I bought a new oil cap from them thinking somehow my oil cap was after market and it turns out it was a bmw cap. It was just loose. Im sorry I'm not the one to just throw money in the trash. Im turning in this car for a Mercedes..... I'll never deal with any BMW anywhere ..  they're all crooks. Ontario is the same. Stay away... far far away and don't buy a warranty. They'll never honor it.<//review>

<Text>I came in for a key fob and was coached into bringing my car in for an "OIL CONSUMPTION TEST" after waiting approx. 5days for the results of the test I was notified by my service rep that they were doing MAJOR work which would take a bit longer. Well the work they were doing had already been done from Irvine BMW. I get my 750i back to find out it was running worse than before I bought it in. Took my car back cause they said it was an misfire which was the reason for my car running horribly.  I paid for that work to be done and less than 1400 miles later my engine blew!!! They were the only ones to lay ahand on my vehicle and now they refuse to find out why I have metal shavings in my oil just 1400 miles later when they had changed the oil during their "OIL CONSUMPTION TEST". When I complained to North America they sent me a copy of the work order which the service tech falsified the work order stating I bought my car in complaining of oil burning and smoke. I was FURIOUS...I simply came in for a quote on a key fob and I'm stuck with my motor blown and they want to classify it as part of an class action lawsuit now. And I'm fighting for them to simply go back and check the work they have to to see if there was any human error on reassembly from there work. It's been a whole month and I'm STILL waiting for someone to take responsibility for ANYTHING at BMW of Riverside.  I received a call from the General Manager and to me since its anLLC I believe the owner and all he had for me was I have GREAT news ...we can give you credit for your car and put you in another car. I DON'T WANT A NEW CAR...I JUST WANT MY CAR FIXED!!! The same car that had NO problems before bringing it to The Supposedly Great BMW of RIVERSIDE....smh....what a nightmare!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Sales staff is great, dealing with the desk managers is awful, 100%. Service is extremely lacking, tries to blame the customer for everything, instead of working with them- even when items/work is covered under warranty. Took my BMW to Murrieta BMW and they give no hassle, work with you extremely well, do all the work correct the first time (unlike Riverside BMW, where you have to keep bringing your car back over and over just to get the work done correctly). I really do recommend taking your BMW to other dealers to get serviced.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Okay now I'm not one to toot my own horn, but I have been told I'm quite the talker and flirt, I can talk and flirt my way out of anything...

That was until the very profession ladies at the BMW loaner desk told me I couldn't flirt my way out of the scratch in my loaner. And I was vehemently trying... Like, I should be nominated for an acadamy award for my performance as an clueless idiot.

But,...Their resolve is unbreakable, and now I'm being held accountable and have to take responsibility for the scratch.

I am now rethinking my approach to life...

I mean, they have been very accommodating to me and will continue to be as my own vehicle is being repaired.

I'm now not sure if this review should be a 5 star or a 1 star...
I'm very torn, my ego is hurt, and my masculinity is fragile,... and not under warranty.

Yes, I'm now this bored.</Review>

Took the car to different dealer they didn't even suggested what this one asked for, from my personal experience I don't think they know how to fix BMW cars.</Review>< name>

< Review>
From the 1st day I came in to lease I receive good customer service, Carlos was always very nice and professional. Before my lease was up I decided to buy my car a 2015 528i and was changed to Ryan, he's great and always very courteous. Last Friday I took my car in for its regular maintenance and this past Thursday my engine light came on, this really concerned me!!! I also noticed that during the maintenance my windshield fluid wasn't fill and was completely empty, not a big deal? Or is it? Ryan was off so Andrew helped me.Super nice guy who of course I ask if part of my maintenance is to check my fluids and his reply was yes, all the fluids.. I told him about it and he said he'll make sure they check it. Turns out my Coolant THERMOSTAT is faulty and needs replacing. I'm still under warranty so they will go ahead and fix it... I'm praying that's it.. I will say that the one thing they have not be able to fix is the air noise penetrating into the car which is getting worse.. Ryan was looking into finding out how to help me with that.. Nothing yet.. I get to pick up my car today..
Andrew contacted me with the time my car would be ready. I got there and it was ready! Loaner was easy to return, everything was fast including the paperwork.. Awesome feeling.. Thank you Andrew!<//Review>

I went to get an oil change done on my BMW, sat in the waiting area for over 3 hours, had to go to the counter to see why it was taking so long, the sales representative forgot about me and did not tell me my car was done, wasted my day.  Giving this experience a 2 since the cookie I had in the waiting area was decent.  Check after an hour with the counter, in case they forget about you....< /review>

I've been doing research and test driving cars for the last 2 months. I wanted a luxury car that would meet all of my needs and wants. I visited Riverside BMW about 1 times not expecting much, but 1st time Vince put forth his best effort to help me. There was no pressure, Vince help me along the way to find the exact car that I wanted. I end up purchasing a 2019 330i . It's almost 1 week now and I have no regret in getting the car. If you are on the market of purchasing a new/used car, don't hesitate to stop by Riverside BMW and ask for Vince. You will get the best buying experiences, I promise!<//review>

< Review>
Resident from Canada, took my BMW cross-country. I was staying nearby this dealership. They took care of my vehicle, had it serviced and washed during my two visits. They were able to honor everything BMW CA would have done, it was a unique situation, but was well handled by the service department.

Almost lost trust in my vehicle after malfunctioning in the middle of traffic, but after my final service before departing for a 30 hour drive, drove it with no more problems. Job well done, Thanks to Fabian Hernandez and the team for making sure my car would make it back to Canada.

Exemplary customer service. Before and after, more BMW dealerships should look up to this place.<//Review>

Took my car in for diagnostic assessment early morning and I was told it would be ready by afternoon and it wasn't. I didn't let that bother me but ended up taking almost two days. When I picked up my car, I saw that it had not been washed at all when I was told it would be washed. They rep that returned my car was not at all apologetic, did not offer to wash it just handed my keys and that was it. I have decided that I will drive all the way to Ontario BMW for better service.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dcb0f31d2c572b:0x100f16f9ce9ba1d6</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><review>I rarely write reviews good or bad but I just could not help myself on this one. This dealership is the absolute BEST! I have been shopping for a new vehicle for months. I am a special case because of back problems which made me gun shy to pull the trigger on a purchase. I ended up working with JR. He was a Godsend. Patient with me and my annoying analytical personality. He was so accommodating and gave the type of first class service you expect from a luxury brand. If you are considering BMW go to him, the guy works his tail off! The dealership is new, gorgeous and smells like a million bucks. LOL. The manager Edwin took excellent care of me and gave me an amazing deal. With my A type personality I went to a dozen dealerships in my search. Save yourself time and just GO HERE!< /review>< Pics>

Very next day coolant low light goes on , car stalls in middle of road.   Overheating.  Limp back to house and wale up to antifreeze on garage floor.

Big thanks to JR in the sales department. This was our 2nd BMW and couldn’t be happier! JR went above and beyond to meet our needs and wants. He will be the only sales representative that we deal with in the future. It gives us great peace of mind dealing with someone so honest and trustworthy.</Review>

Be careful of the warranties they sell you.  I bought a "total Image Protection" warranty for my 328i BMW.  Now that it's time to use it, the warranty company can not be contacted.  When I reached out to BMW riverside, no one is in charge of warranty so they took my name and number down, but yet no one called me back.  I wished I had searched the name of the warranty company they sold me and i would have seen the negative reviews about the warranty company: Dynamic auto images
You would think a BMW dealer would sell you a reputable company and not a scam company.</Text>

Over the years, before I had my BMW-I drove other cars and had service at  a lot of other dealers-and none of them could even come close to the level and quality of service that I've had from BMW of Riverside.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Bought my wife's car there about 4 months ago. Craig was a great salesman. No pressure. Very friendly. Even with our purchased of a used BMW, we feel like we have been welcomed with open arms into the BMW family. I have taken the car in for service and nothing different than the sales experience. Great all around. I have no problem referring friends and family to BMW and this dealership. It's been great.<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>I just purchased a used ’09 BMW X5 4.8. I love it. The salesman, Rocky, was extremely helpful and understood what I was looking for. When we found a vehicle almost perfect I was hesitant to purchase. When asked why, it was simply because I did not like the stock 18’s (wheels & tires) that were on the X5. Between Rocky and the sales manager, Tye they put an order in for the upgraded sport  offset 20’s.  Even better they saved me $4K on the brand new rims/tires!  They will be installed next week. I appreciate their customer service and creative problem solving skills to get the vehicle I was looking for.  Lastly, I am not new to BMW Riverside. John in the service department has been keeping my ’99 M3 in tip-top shape for many years now. He even assisted in the Dinan Stage II performance upgrades, and yes BMW Riverside installed all performance parts. Great people, great service, awesome cars, great dealership!</Review><user_name>Jason Reyes< /user_name>< Rating>

Took my car there for recall.They broke it more than before I brought it to them. This place sucks. Don’t ever buy or repair here .Very incompetent. Very sneaky.
Hi
What the technician said?
after replacing the crankshaft sensor, the car still has trouble running, it starts fine now but the car does not drive properly, it will go into limp mode, technician says that there is either something wrong with the DME or transmission not allowing the car to accelerate. Tech says that he will need more diagnostic fee to check to find out why, the cost to check is additional $585.00</review>

I walked their used and new lots for 30 minutes and was not approached or even glanced at by any sales staff. I ended up buying a part for my sister's vehicle just to see if someone would ask if I'd been helped out or needed help and still nothing. I was hoping to start a lease on a new M3 but after their lack of service I'll be looking elsewhere.<//Text>

I don't know how to say it. My sakes man is amazing my service guy is wonderful .the loaner department is a nightmare .Even though you have an appointment and you tell them what you want and I even reschedule my appointment still want to give me a small car. Called the loaner department manager more than once but never called back .every other manager call back except that manager. He probably know how bad he is running it .Not too mention theattitude on the loaner department people .
For me service means a lot .Everything there I love except that ..i won't be leasing with them anymore .<//review>

< review>
After multiple BMW-dealership failures, I found a car that interested me in Riverside, so I inquired and was connected with Gianna Pancucci, whose work ethic and desire to win my business blew me away. She eagerly answered every question I had (there were many) and coordinated my out-of-state purchase seamlessly.

Beyond her sales professionalism, she was a knowledgeable and passionate BMW/motoring enthusiast, which is far rarer than you think. This was the icing on the cake.

The car had no hidden issues, and they were fair on pricing.

Gianna made things so easy and satisfying that I’d be willing to buy another one-way plane ticket and endure the 20-hour drive back home again, for the right car.

If you know or think you want a BMW and a positive buying experience, call BMW of Riverside and specifically demand Gianna. She will see that you’re taken care of!<//review>

My name is Vic and I am a self confessed car maven. On 5-21-15 I went to BMW Riverside and had the absolutely BEST car buying experience I ever had. Emil was so very helpful in getting me my DREAM F-82. Emil worked diligently to honor the promises we had worked out on an earlier visit. I was not only able to order my special dream car....but also got some custom carbon fiber parts as well that is like icing on the cake. Andrew Cruz was my sales rep and he was very professional and helpful. He was very patient with me and worked closely with Emil to get all the details of my desires sorted out. Riverside BMW is full of courteous professionals with a no pressure helpful attitude. I did a TON of research and shopped every BMW dealership in so cal. I chose Riverside because Emil and his staff made me feel comfortable and relaxed as well as attending to all the small nuances that a maven like myself has. I could not give Emil and the is dealership a higher recommendation. Andrew followed up today (5-26-15) with a nice email and a pdf file of my build sheet.....I was so excited to see my car...even if it was just on paper. :)
I called him with a few questions and he was courteous and professional. If you want the best BMW experience ever.....Riverside is the place.</text>

Don’t buy a vehicle from this place.  According to their joke BMW specialist, they don’t sell their M’s lowered than MSRP!! Who do they think they are still thinking these cars are unique!! Bunch of clowns plus their customer service was awful never did they came up to us to ask if we needed any assistance.  I had to reach out for help when most of their employees were just hanging around wasting time.

I recommend any other BMW dealership for your next purchase.</Review>

<Review>Every experience I have had at this dealership has been fantastic.  When I went to buy my car, they were respectful and took me seriously, not to mention, had the best price.  I'm a young guy and was buying an expensive car, and other dealers didn't want to give me the time a day, but these guys did.  The purchase process was smooth, honest, and fair.

As for service, I have gone twice.  Both times the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Nice lounge area.  This last time, my phone died while I was driving the loan car back to the dealer to pick mine up.  I was in the middle of negotiating a big deal.  When I got to the dealer, I asked if anybody had an iPhone5 charger, and the manager of the dealership came out of his office and gave me his phone charger and set me up in the business center to work and charge my phone!  Perfect customer service!</Review>< pictures>

Simple, smooth process, I knew what I wanted, they listened, they provided, we agreed, and that is how simple this whole process should be. Larry Winkler was the facilitator in this process, professional and pleasure to work with, and the same could be said for the other folks involved as well. Stay tuned for more, as a BMW credit refund is still pending, but I have faith this going to be handled just like my purchase, and there should be no issues:). Glad I came to this dealership, and look forward to more future interactions. Max

Update on the credit refund, handled perfect, love it!</Review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>I received a notice from BMWNA to replace my passenger airbag (recall), first call to BMW of Riverside, they stated they didn't have parts, call back or the manufacturer at this time. Waited about a month and called back to inquire again, this time they put me on a waiting list and ordered the airbag for my car. about 3-4 weeks later they called to schedule my replacement. Showed up at the scheduled time, but they didn't have me scheduled. The service person asked my if I had an appointment, I thought "here we go, not scheduled"... The SA came out 5 minutes later and proceeded to process me for service. After that, they got me to the loaner car person or desk. a coupe of hours later I received a call my car was finished. Turned in the loaner car and over to the cashier and they had my car ready and cleaned. Pretty much in and out. I would have given them 5 stars except for the mix up waiting for service that they didn't have me scheduled. Other than that, typical friendly Ultimate Driving Experience you would expect from BMW.</text>< Response>

I've been coming to BMW of Riverside for the last 3 years for parts on my cars. While I cannot comment on their sales or service departments I will say the parts department here is top notch, they always treat me very well and extremely professional. Danny B. has always helped me out and gone the extra mile to help me find the right parts and give me advice to any of my questions. The gentlemen that work in the parts department have a wealth of knowledge with BMW's and some are even vintage BMW enthusiasts like myself!< /Review>

<review>My experience with BMW Riverside was very smooth! Justin Meadville helped me with the entire process and he made sure I got answers to all the questions I had. I got a BMW 435i loaded with all the packages at an amazing price of ~$58k. I would recommend you to have a look at BMW Riverside if you ever plan on buying a car, since they have really good deals. I am very happy with my purchase!<//review>< Response>

I have had good experiences here. This last time I came in because my starter went out and warranty took care of it. I just paid my $100.00 deductible. The service adviser that helped me was Nick. He has helped me before and is prompt in getting back to me with the status of my car and has good customer service.</review>

<Text>Paid over $200 to purchase a key from BMW Riverside. The key didn't work. Had to come back 3 times and was told I would have to pay for a diagnostic to find out why the key didn't work. I pushed back because my car works well with my broken key. They told me that I wouldn't have to pay if the diagnostic proved that it's not my car...not sure why that would be the case when my old broken key works perfectly. After pushing they said they would provide a loaner car while they do the diagnostic because customer should not be inconvenienced yet again, I've called more than 4 times to resolve this and they had no loaner car each time. It's been 3 months. All I want is my money back or a working key. The people are nice but this is not customer service!<//Text>< Pics>

We were in the Riverside area when we had some tire issues. On a Saturday morning, Brice, a knowledgeable advisor, assured us that the service department at Riverside BMW could resolve our issue in a couple of hours. We were pleasantly welcomed at the dealership, promptly checked-in, and escorted to the attractive waiting area. Brice kept us informed of the progress on our vehicle, and within 2 hours we were on our way. What could have been a disastrous weekend experience was handled quickly and professionally,. Hats off to Riverside BMW!

Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times:
It all started a year and a half ago when I first brought in my 2015 328xi Gran Turismo for service at BMW of Riverside. I went in for a change in brake fluid after receiving notification on my vehicle, and after the service was performed, the BMW Riverside Service Department would not release me my vehicle. I was told “my brakes were too low to release me the vehicle”, and that an $1,100 brake rotor and pad service would need to be performed. I declined, as the price quoted is more than what I was given elsewhere such as Sterling and Crevier and wanted the service performed either of these locations; they held my vehicle hostage and would not release me my vehicle, even though I had driven it there in the first place. A week goes by as I plead with the Service Department to release me MY property, with no give. I cave, as I needed my vehicle for work, and have the vehicle towed elsewhere at my expense. Strike one for withholding my personal possessions that weren’t even initially purchased at this location.

A couple months go by, and my vehicle starts exhibiting strange behavior. I would receive the dreaded infamous “Drivetrain Malfunction” notification on my vehicle’s screen, and the vehicle would go into “limp mode” with full engine output not available. Turning the car off and on would temporarily reset the vehicle back to normal, until the issue would reappear a few hundred miles later. Foolishly after the first incident with this dealership, I take my car back for service at BMW Riverside being that is the slightly-closest location. I, like many this day and age, have an OBD II reader and a companion app that can read BMW diagnostic and error codes that are shown to the dealer when they check on your vehicle. The error codes stored in the vehicle stated that cylinders 2 and 4 were shutting down due to not receiving enough fuel: a mechanical malfunction. I have an extended warranty on my vehicle that covers the full cost of repair for all mechanical faults around engine components with a small deductible. I mention this mechanical fault to the service representative when first dropping off my vehicle for service; I sign for the diagnostic thinking, when I get my vehicle serviced it’ll go towards the repair cost anyway. After diagnosing the vehicle, the service rep states that there are NO MECHANICAL FAULTS with the vehicle, and that a software update to the cars ECU would alleviate the issue. I contest him, as the codes stored in the car state that a mechanical fault is present. Beyond that, when the vehicle goes in this limp state, you can physically feel the cars vibrations as the cylinders shut down, and can hear the fuel pump malfunctioning. The Service Manager at the time, Travis,  was very firm in keeping the diagnosis as a software issue in order to avoid having my warranty cover the cost of the repair, and instead wanted to force me to pay out of pocket by misdiagnosing the issue as electronic-related. The service rep once again holds my vehicle hostage until I pay $200 for an incorrect diagnosis; seeing it as a lost cause to contend any further, I pay the full $500 for the diagnosis and ECU update in the hopes that it will fix my issue. Fast forward 2 weeks after I pay for the ECU update, and my vehicle once again goes into limp mode as I’m commuting to work on the freeway, with the same “Drivetrain Malfunction” error present.. This time turning the vehicle off and on wouldn’t return it to normal,  and the vehicle needed to be towed to BMW Riverside, once again at my expense. This time, the service manager Travis acknowledge his mistake, and replaced the low fuel pump on my vehicle to actually fix the issue for no more than the $500 I had already paid. Ultimately, this situation cost me $400 more than it should have as it was a warranty-covered issue, plus the cost of tows and work missed. But it doesn’t end there: I dropped off my vehicle to BMW Riverside -I have oil dripping from underneath my car.< /Review>

How to Brake BMW Enthusiast Loyalty
I owned a 1995 5 series, a 2003 530I (sold recently), and a 2007 X5.   Last fall, after a recall on my Z4, walking out of service, I fell for the M4 in the CPO lot at Riverside BMW.  I then owned the ‘03 Z4 and ‘03 5 series.
First strike Sales People Fall 2018
When I showed my interest in the CPO M4. I was offered 900 dollars for my 03 5 series. The immediate response that I did not share (they said it for me…”we don’t want to appear to be stealing your 5 series” is what they said…) was that the sales team was trying to rip me off and steal my car for a ridiculously low price.  I recently sold this 5 series car 3 weeks ago for $7,500.
I purchased 07 M6 subsequent to the Riverside BMW sales strike. (Fall 2018)
	Since I was still captured by the M4, and unable to get a reasonable trade with Riverside BMW, I went and found an M6. I purchased a 2007 M6 which I fell in love with.
Second Strike Service Estimate for M6 in first quarter 2019
In the early part of 2019, I had an EDC engine message on the 07 M6 and the quote I received from BMW Riverside was near $2,000 to repair. The EDC unit was quoted at close to $1000 and the manpower for a little less than $1000 dollars.   I purchased an EDC module on my own for a dramatically lower price, watched a youtube video, and replaced and fixed it in 10 minutes. I am not a mechanic.
Third Strike Service Estimate for M6 last week
Engine lights came up. Diagnosed to parts at $2,179.40 and $1520. Labor.  I bought new BMW parts for $1200 and Authorized BMW mechanic to repair for $400.00. Riverside BMW inflated the cost nearly $2000 over cost.
My 10 year old daughter accused me as being obsessed with BMW…all from having apparel, phone cases, many shirts that I wear when going to dine, key holders, cup holders…and an undeniable amount of free marketing for the BMW brand. I was BMW marketing and loving the ride too.
Riverside BMW Sales and Service have proven to be more than greedy…it’s actually closer to an ethics breech. Riverside BMW Sales and Service appear to be directed by the same source. Common thread going on. Trying to be polite and avoiding any derogative terms, BMW Riverside have lost my business going forward.
	I dumped the M6 on Saturday in favor of Riverside Porsche. Almost bought the Tesla Model X but I decided to purchase a beautiful PHEV Porsche and as long as they will treat me right, I will keep putting my money into them.
My family and friends witnessed what happened…so the impact Riverside BMW has on me extends beyond one mistreated customer. I still own one BMW (beautiful ’03 Z4 mint). Short of a miracle, there is not much BMW Riverside can do to fix my situation…I am hoping that the owner of Riverside BMW gets a look at this story and decides how long his or her business is going to last by either status quo, make it worse, or make it better…at the end of the day…you can’t stay in business without customers. Loyalty can only be rewarded with fairness.< /text><Time>1560179414626<//Time>< GmapID>

If you've had bad experiences as I have with other BMW service locations come to BMW of Riverside. Expressed my frustration regarding service from BMW of Ontario to Paul Brewer, he made sure to make my experience as most convenient and pleasant as possible, extremely satisfied with the end result. If not for Paul Brewer, I would not be purchasing a new BMW in a couple of months.< /Review>

<Text>I spoke to a girl named Tiffany at the service department as a service advisor. I explain to her my situation with my vehicle and then I needed a smog test because it was throwing a code I advised her to please check and see if it's covered under warranty otherwise I would go to my local mechanic versus dealership she said go ahead and come in numerous times and set an appointment and push me to come into the dealership. I drove all the way there 15 miles at which point she told me you have to pay $190 just to check it out and it's not covered under warranty. I feel like it was a bait and switch tactic just to get me there and I'm very upset with the process and I would never go back to Riverside BMW. The service manager of the department was great and tried to help but did find the information that my car was not covered. All of that is fine if I would have been told that up front. This lady Tiffany should have told me that and failed to do her job properly. Very unhappy with her<//Text>< pictures>

<Date>1371417182397</Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Brought my BMW in yesterday to have the battery cable replaced per recall from BMW headquarters as well as have my oil changed.  The service girl who met me at the garage was polite with a pleasant smile and attitude, as was the fellow who later waited on me.  When I came to pick up my car later that same day, after I was promptly phoned and told it was ready, it had been washed and vacuumed.  And whoever did the cleaning did a fine job of it.  Better, honestly, than previous times I've brought my BMW to be serviced.  Must be a new person on the job and he or she is doing it well.  Overall, not a complaint here.  Just good, personable and professional service and treatment.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>This place has always treated me well with my old BMW and having never actually purchased a BMW from them.  Customer service has been great.   At this review they are under remodel which makes it kind of less comfortable and convient.  But I am sure it will be better than it was previously. Which was nice.  Can't say anything but good things about the customer service I have received.</Review>< user_id>

We leased a car in October of 2014 and what a nice experience-They were very professional and made you feel at home. I had done business with another BMW Dealership and had a bad experience and almost switched to Mercedes. I called BMW Financial and they told me to try another dealership, reluctantly I did and it was great. Thank you, Riverside BMW.<//Review>

I have driven the car less then 12000 since then and now my warning light came on to have the same brakes replaced again.  Even the service representative at BMW riverside stated that brakes are not normally replaced that soon.  I will have to pay $190 just to have my car inspected and pay to have the brakes replaced if that is the problem.  I just had my brakes replaced one year ago.  It took me 5 years to have the first set of brakes replaced and my route and commute has not changed since then. I don’t understand how this is not under warranty since it was done a year ago. The service at BMW Is really dissapointing.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dcb0f31d2c572b:0x100f16f9ce9ba1d6</gmapID></record>

BMW of Riverside treated me the way that I would expect from a high end car dealer.  They had a pre-owned BMW I was interested in and they had it ready for test drive when I arrived. In an hour's time they appraised my trade in and we made a deal. Painless process!</Review>

BMW policy is to only replace the transmission because they do not do work on them. I originally had this at another shop, but didn't feel comfortable with the technicians expertise, so I brought it here.

I was helped by Travis who was amazing throughout this process. I was out of state while the repair was occurring and Travis communicated the whole time with me, with constant updates. He got my GF a loaner car to use during the whole thing as well. The fixed the issue with the transmission, but for some reason there was an additional issue.

Here is where Travis went above and beyond. He contacted BMW North America and spoke with his bosses extensively and replaced my whole transmission free of charge because they could not pin-point the issue and I had already paid for a repair. He sent down someone to pick up my broken car and drop off a loaner as well, which made the experience much better.

Great place to deal with< /text><name>Mark Cassell<//name>< pics>

<text>The service at this location is fantastic and I cannot recommend this place enough.  Nick Cappellano kept me in the know about my vehicle and if I had any questions or concerns he addressed them extensively.  I will be returning very soon to this exact location to have my vehicle serviced even further, hell I might even break something just so I can go back there immediately and repeat the experience all over again.<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>If it's about service for your bmw avoid this place at all costs.
They don't know how to solve problems, they just try to tell you different stories about your car and what parts do you need to change, always trying to sell you what you don't need and parts that doesn't need to be replaced.
It's happened to me already two time over here that
They didn't solve my problem and just try to sell me parts which my car does not need to be replaced or repaired and after I went to different technician he solved my problem saved me a lot of money and didn't even talk about the same parts that they tried to sell me "to make it work"

I just paid for nothing in bmw riverside the problems keeps showing up until I went to different place which took care of the problem.

The worst place to fix your car, I'll never be back to this place and do not do the same mistake as me to think that the bmw dealer is the best place to take care of your car.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< Review>
I dropped off my X3 to have it serviced last week. From the time I pulled into the lot, opened my door and drove off in a loaner was a great experience. Everyone was so helpful, professional and friendly. I even received a call from the mechanic. I live and work in Big Bear Lake. BMW is the best mountain car you could have. I went from a Lexus to a BMW. Winter 2010 we received 5 feet of snow and I never had to chain up my car. I would recommend anyone to BMW of Riverside. Customer service from start to finish is #1.<//Review>

I bought a M6 from these guys, be prepared to do your own work as to getting your car registered, once the deal is done, they forget about you.I bought a car from them and had it delivered to Massachusetts. Bought the car on 06/19/15 and now it's 08/04/15 still my car hasn't been registered, and I've spent over 10hrs at the DMV. Plus I was promised things that I have not yet received. When you're buying a M6 you deserve some good service. My only tip, be cautious and be prepared.
Update: I sent a message to whom I bought the car from, and he just shipped a package the next day (8/05/15), but before he said it was already shipped when we did the deal on 6/19/2015...<//Text>

Overall good review. Everything went well with the exception of a small scrape on the front fascia on my new M240. Also the free Sirius radio subscription was not activated before I left the dealer. Ipod nano music not recognized, etc. Love the car otherwise. BMW lives up to its reputation where it counts.< /Review>

Getting your car serviced here even with an appointment can be a nightmare. There have been a couple times where I was unable to get my car serviced because they were unaware of the appointment I had made online. We bought our last two Beemers from this dealership and the purchase process was nearly painless. Getting the car serviced is another problem. If you go here, make sure you stick with the same service advisor so you can a more personable relationship with them and them with your car!<//Review>

Pretty good service, knowledgeable salesman. What I didn't like is way they do business - not professional, but bargain style. Someone might like it. E.g. offered 2018 model with 4K milage for 56K. Then make a 'discount' to lower price to 51K. Seems to be a good deal - but in fact the same choice is available in all other dealers - Autotrader shows 51-52K from multiple dealers. So it was not a discount, but a fair price. I do not like that approach - it is very close to direct lie.< /text>

<Review>I had just purchased my CPO BMW from another dealer and after a short time needed a service and a minor sensor replacement. Travis helped me through my first BMW service experience.

You have the most exceptional staff starting with My service manager Nick Cappellano. Nick is professional, has his eyes on the ball, he knows his job and does it well. I love coming there just for the Service I receive, let alone my 335i gets. Give him a Big Bonus he is all about you and the BMW's he attends to on daily basis, I know one thing He Earns What You Pay Him. Thank You Nick!

P.S. also a shout out to Cynthia the one who gave me a ride home and picked me up, just another excellent employee... Thank You Cynthia!</review>

<review>I was helped by Mark Decker and he couldn't be nicer. It was a very welcoming atmosphere and we were always asked if we needed water or other refreshments. We test drove the 328i and that's what we ended up purchasing. He took more than enough time to sit down after the sale and teach me as many things about the inside system as possible. He also made follow up calls to make sure everything was running smoothly in the car. He and the entire staff were a big help. Would return for business.<//review></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I was sold a brand new 2018 BMW X1 with an engine fan that was “coming apart” and “damaged.” These are the exact words from a BMW service report I obtained after a vehicle inspection in Sherman Oaks, just two weeks after purchasing my car. The salesperson misrepresented the vehicle’s condition during the sale (said the loud noise from the fan was normal) and I am now filing a fraudulent misrepresentation complaint against this dealership. I tried resolving this matter with the dealership privately, but the dealership claims it is not at fault, and said that my complaint was "unfair." Do yourself a favor and do not purchase your next vehicle from BMW of Riverside.<//review>< Pics>

I received a letter of interest to buy my car.  Supposedly someone wanted to buy it and would make it worth my while to get a deal done.  What is their IDEA of making it worth my while.  $9,000 below KBB.  When I said I was insulted at this offer, they had the nerve to tell me they had to advertise the car.  When I said I would sell it for $1,000 below their best offer if they could find my car online for their offer; their response was "you'll never find it that low because we have to dramatically raise the price to advertise the car".  Beware....stay away.<//text>

<review>This review is for their service department. I had a SCHEDULED appointment for an oil change on Saturday, March 2 at 9:30AM. I arrived on the service drive and no one was available to greet me, so I got out of my car and approached one of the advisors.. who happened to be the advisor I was scheduled with. Huu greeted me and said he was finishing up with another customer and he would be with me in a moment. I went into the customer service lounge to wait for him and he approached with the paper work and advised that my oil change would take one hour and forty five minutes.
I was aware of the time frame as I was given it over the phone when I scheduled service a few days prior. I asked to for a shuttle service to a coffee shop down the street  and Huu asked "are you sure you dont want to stay?" No thanks.. so I get shuttled over to the coffee shop and had breakfast and coffee while I waited.
Fast forward to 12:08 in the AFTERNOON, I finally text Huu to ask if my vehicle is ready. I got a response at 12:19 that my vehicle was ready. I texted him back immediately asking for a shuttle service BACK to the dealership and no response. I called the dealership 10 minutes later and Jenny answered, I asked her to page Huu or connect me to him. She transferred me over, and it rang back to her. I let her know it was still me and she said "He must be busy if he doesn't answer I don't know what we can do about it." UM OK? I finally gave up requesting for a shuttle service and took a Lyft back over to the dealership. How did a SIMPLE OIL change cost me HALF MY DAY! I left the dealership at ONE IN THE AFTERNOON. AND HAD TO FIND MY OWN WAY BACK TO PICK UP MY CAR?!. If I had known ANY BETTER that Riverside BMW was going to be inconsiderate of my time I would have gone out to Crevier BMW in Santa Ana because they know what putting their customers first means.</review>< pictures>

Outstanding customer service, particularly Fabian Hernandez. I messed up my appointment and was a week early (doh!) but was well-accommodated with professional and friendly staff every step of the way. Definitely will be returning for regular service despite have several dealers closer to where I live - absolutely worth the extra drive.< /Review>

My Wife and I bought our first 5-Series at BMW of Riverside and the experience was absolutely delightful.  Pablo, our sales associate, was amazing.  He gave a first class presentation on our new vehicle and we knew this was the car for us.  Tom, the Sales Manager presented the numbers quickly and professionally and CC, our Finance Manager, took the time explaining the numbers to make sure we were comfortable.  I would absolutely reccomend doing business with BMW of Riverside...this is a World Class Organization!< /review>

Terrible service especially on the sales department they treat you like s*** when they look at you that looks like a Mexican or Latino no way to fix no way to fix any problem and they argue a lot they always trying to win in order for them not to pay or not to fix anything even if the car is coming brand new with defects and the worse the general managers sales representative he treat you so bad the honest with you I will never recommend BMW of Riverside for any reasons he use his authority to make youfeel like  minority.. this is my car experience on BMW Riverside</Review>

I don't even know where to start with this place. I will start by saying the sales team is great, took care of me and made me feel very well getting my 16 M3. As for the service dept and theyre "techs" i am MIND BLOWN HOW LOW THEY TREAT CLIENTS! Ive taken my car in two times and both times gave me the worst excuses on why they couldn't figure out the issues. Not to mention they gave me excuses as if I were naive towards cars. The last time i took it in was for slight shaking under braking. Well I wanted to test how they really work and even left one lug nut off the front wheel. Well when i picked it in they said they inspected the pads and rotors but yet didn't take the wheels off to do the measuring? After all of this I got fed up and just told them to have my car ready for me to pick up. When picking up my car was so dirty from sitting there that they couldn't even wash it. Oh and left the plastic papers on the inside. Ive received better customer service at WalMart then this place. Never again will anyone from my family, friends or I get a car from this place.<//Review>

< Review>
Got a good deal on a CPO. But they hit me hard on the lease return (tires, few scratches underside of bumper and door). Not happy about that AT ALL. For the most part I head that dealerships don't care too much about this stuff, but Riverside seemed to want to take me to the bank on it.< /Review>

Configured a special order for my new 2015 BMW M235i Coupe to obtain the exact options I wanted. Internet Sales Manager Roland Clark provided excellent service working with me and my configured special order. When the vehicle was received in Riverside he and BMW Genius Charyl Freeman delivered it to my Palm Springs residence where they spent time with me while I became familiar with the new vehicle's many features. Both Clark and Freeman have provided after delivery follow-up to make certain I am satisfied and satisfactorily becoming accustomed to my new BMW. I have rated both individuals and my entire BMW of Riverside experience with 5 stars and would definitely recommend both of these professionals and the dealership.< /review>

<Text>Bad attitude. All they care is money. They call and text a lot before we pay, and work with a very low efficiency after they get the money. The salesman didnt even reply me when I asked about how's everything going. That's his job and he promised me he would. Good thing is that I don't live there and will never go there again.< /Text>< pictures>

These three guys are the reason BMW of Riverside receives so many 5 star ratings.  They, each of them, go out of their way to make sure the customer - in this case, me - is greeted warmly, treated with high regard, courtesy and above all kept informed of all that is going on with the vehicle.  They are proactive, friendly and genuinely interested in making sure the customer is satisfied.  They also make up for any aggravation you may have with the process of getting the vehicle serviced.

I also want to mention that the people that work on the vehicle also go the extra distance to make sure everything that needs attention gets that attention.  They too are proactive and make sure all areas are checked, rechecked and attended to.

I give 6 stars if I could.
Darko, Mike and Don --- Thanks!!!

I came in in response to a service light (not specific). I was advised to get a $265 check up, and decided to do that another time. After being advised on the charges for the oil change, ($118), the gentleman told me it would be approximately 2 hours to complete an oil change. I waited THREE HOURS. Then went to his desk to inquire on the status of my vehicle ( I needed to leave soon to pick my daughter up from school). I was advised that he was at lunch. I asked if my vehicle was done and was told my a staff member that my car was done, and was awaiting a car wash. Oil change-1040am-204pm. After discussing this experience with my husband we decided we'll take our chances on jiffy lube next time.</review>

Buying the car was easy, but getting it registered in my home state has been a nightmare.  After not getting any help from Riverside BMW, I myself contacted the California DMW even though I don't live there only to find out that they had screwed up the address on the registration to send the title to.  Not sure if that was on Riverside BMW or the state, but I have emailed and called Riverside BMW for assistance with little to no response back.  Just beware that once you buy, the service is gone to make sure you get what you need.  I would think they would want to get me the title ASAP, but that has not been the case.</text><userid>106403230192575948226<//userid>< date>

<text>The minute you pull in for service you are greeted by a man that inspects your car for dents and dings.   Don't let him touch your car.  I paid for a door ding and dent fix and the work to this point has never been completed after 3 months and 2 visits to the service department.  On the second visit, I reminded him twice of the needed repair.  He was always going to check on the paint, but obviously he never did because after having my car 3 days he never did the work but was full of excuses as to why he couldn't do it.  This review isn't intended to reflect negatively on the other services, but of this dent guy....BEWARE!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< username>

We Purchased a BMW from Riverside BMW in March 2013, I have had to go back for a few things to get serviced, Every Time I have gone back our Advisor has always been the same one  Nicolas Cappellano, Every single time Nicholas Has Been Very Professional, Courteous, always on time, making sure that If I need anything he gets it for me.  In a few words Nicholas Rolls out the Red carpet for Me, He makes me feel at ease. I love this Dealership and would Recommend anyone to go there. We have been so Lucky and thankful to have Nicolas be the same person to deal with. BMW, Thank you for Having such a great employee like Nicolas he is someone I can Trust with his opinions regarding my Car.< /Text>

<Review>my brother purchased a bmw jacket for me for my birthday from signal hill bmw. it was too small. during an oil service visit to bmw riverside, i tried to exchange the unworn jacket (tags still on), but the parts department refused to do so for 2 reasons: #1. they didn't have an XL, but more importantly, it wasn't purchased from bmw riverside. i requested to talk to the dealership manager, and he said the same thing. after i posted a 1 star review of this dealership, and the fact that BMW should provide better customer service, there was a 180 degree change in attitude. they agreed to exchange the jacket, and ship it to my office. i look at it this way, if i bought the same jacket online from bmw, and it was the wrong size, i could simply ship it to them, and get the correct size? so why can't i do that at a local dealership? i understand that they are independently owned, etc. but stealerships should provide some basic customer service!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I am from outstate . I liked a car that they had  mercedes c300 convertible.2017 they were asking 41499 for the car . I offered them 39 and 40 gs they refused . I gave up. 3 to 4 days a guy by the name Vincent called me . He said he wanna do business. So I offered him the ticket price which is 41499 out the door . He accepted the offer with one condition . As long as the car won't touch the California ground . Means I have to ship the car to ohio . They were charging me 1300 which I didn't mind . At the end I found out  they were trying to get paid to ship the car to ohio and once I get in will have to pay for the ohio sales tax . Even if we agreed on the price  out the door .  The worse part was the financing, they ran my credit and offered me a 5.99 rate then said that they wouldn't finance me because my current address wasn't on my credit report which wasn't a big deal cause my bank ended up financing me for 4.99 ....long story short I walked away with a hit on my credit and no car because these people didnt hold true to deal they tried to pull a fast one.

I used to have my car serviced at Crevier, and I would say that my t recent service at BMW of Riverside surpasses that of Crevier's excellence. From the friendly and attentive service advisor, Travis, to loaner representative, everyone there is very friendly and helpful. Even the seasoned mechanic, Mark, took the time to test drive the car with me to diagnose a creaking sound by the window.</Text>

<Review>I recently had a bad experience with the department of parts. The person i spoke with is possibly Hispanic with black hair. This guy thought he knew everything and clearly couldn't't answer my questions. He had to go look for parts several times and couldnt get me what i needed.

Larry Winkler and Chris Sharpe were huge help in getting me into my new 435i.  Love the car, and the deal was easy to negotiate.  First class service all the way.  I have already used this dealer for the past 3 years on the service side, which I really like.  And now I have bought two 2014 BMW's here and have enjoyed the process each time.

Larry Winkler is a very knowledgeable salesman.  He knows the cars, the features, and he drives a 435i with a manual shift transmission (he is a crazy man--meaning a real car enthusiast of course).

Definitely recommend this dealer for any BMW purchase.  You won't be disappointed.< /text>

I was looking to buy a BMW for a while.
I came to BMW of Riverside and a young man named Sujan helped me find a great car, let me test drive, and he wasn't pushy either. Glad I chose to go to this dealership.< /text>

<review>This week I needed to service both our cars, a 328i and a 128i.  The personal service and the pampering I have received are beyond excellent.  I was given superb care and professional attention.  The service advisor, Mr. Jose Meza guided me through the process, explaining in detail what would be done and then put me on a loaner. Periodically, I was kept informed about the progress of the service and Mr. Meza worked around my schedule and made my experience flawless.  This is what excellence is all about.  Thank you!< /review>< user_name>

DO NOT TRUST THEM. If you want to lease or buy a car from them make sure to show your contract to a lawyer. They are not trust worthy. I took my complain to their general manager Antony Chandler He was very rude and unprofessional.< /review>

Nick Cappellano has made all the difference in my opinion of Riverside BMW.  Nick provides highly professional, yet individual attention, that takes what would normally be a frightful (it is a BMW after all) experience and turns it into something positive.  I have dealt with many BMW service advisors over the years and I can honestly say Nick is simply the best!  He knows the vehicle, he takes a hands on approach, doesn't try to sell you something you don't need and just generally makes the experience positive when servicing my BMW.  Kudos to Nick.<//text>

<text>Definitely  the worst car dealership I've ever met!
And when you’re trying to get the BMW Riverside’s management on the phone, don’t waste your time,  it’s just impossible!
How can a brand like BMW accept their image to be tarnished with such terrible service ?!?!</text>< Name>

In fact, it's my 2nd time bringing my car to be serviced at Riverside.  My Service Advisor, Travis, is awesome!  Travis is very courteous, professional and genuinely shows interest with my past visits.  So far so good.

I've had the same caliber of Service Advisor from Savage BMW where I purchased my last 2 BMWs until he left the dealership.  It's been downhill ever since.

I've been very pleased with the services I've received at BMW Riverside therefore will continue to take my car there.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Following up on my review of this company being a two star by demoting them down to a one star.

I purchased a vehicle almost 90 days ago and I still cannot get the title due to an error by Riverside BMW.  Since I purchased the vehicle out of state and wasn't given temp tags, it has sat in my garage and I cannot drive it without the risk of being pulled over.  I wrote a google review several weeks ago, and received a reply from the manager on here.   I emailed him as he said to do in the response, yet here we are several weeks later with no response from him.

All of the times I have reached out to the dealership for help, yet I am offered none.  I received GREAT service before the sale, and received NO service since the sale.

Count me as one UNSATISFIED customer.</Review>

Do not trust them with body work. They had me come pick up my car and the power steering wasn't working. They blamed the body shop. I just found that I have no engine shield and they also blame the body shop. The body shop in question is Caliber Collision where BMW subbed it out to under their name... Caliber claims BMW left it off and vice versa. Either way BMW Riverside can not be trusted because they refuse to take responsibility or ownership when they sub out work. They don't even check it out with their own eyes before you pick it up. They said they try to be a one stop shop, but since now I am on my own to file supplements, they are just one of my many stops.< /Text>

Rarely review car dealerships but the experience was unpleasant enough that I thought I should warn future visitors. The dealers were very unprofessional. After discussing a model and price over the phone, they tried to pull a bait and switch. Refused to disclose basic calculations on how the lease price was arrived until I was insistent. Were not interested in informing the customer.< /text>

My purchase experience with Mark and Emille was very pleasant and an enjoyable experience. Both were on the up and up during negotiatings and did not play any games which I really appreciated. It was a straightforward process from start to finish. Mark also setup my Euro Delivery and the whole experience was very enjoyable for myself and family. Both the service and pricing I received from BMW of Riverside was much better than what I was used to at the other dealerships in the LA and OC areas! I am glad I was able to stay local and get a great deal and work with some very nice people at the same time. Two thumbs up for BMW of Riverside!<//Text>

<Text>I went with my wife to this dealer and leased a BMW 3 series for my business, and I wanted to take a brief time just to let everybody know how pleased I was with the way I was treated.

The employee taking care of us was Dave Oberle.

Their inventory exeeded my expectations by far. Minutes after I arrived, and with absolutely no hassle, I was behind the wheel test driving a new BMW. As part of the test drive I was taken to a second parking lot where they have extra inventory ... there I found the car I was really looking for.

about the car ... well, you can never go wrong with a BMW

As a customer I was extremely satisfied with their service, friendliness, inventory, price ... I would recommend anybody looking for a BMW within a driving distance of Riverside to go to this dealer.<//Text>< Resp>

I did not receive good service at BMW of Riverside.  The oil level indicator on my X3 was defective and kept giving an "Add 1-quart of oil" warning.  This happened 4 times between March-December 2015.  BMW of Riverside Service Manager (John Horgan) dismissed my concerns with a shrug of the shoulders saying, "BMWs burn oil".  It turns out that BMW of Riverside kept topping off my oil each time I asked for help until I put my foot down and demanded they do a more thorough check.  it was then discovered that the gauge was faulty.  I am angry that all of this time, BMW of Riverside took the lazy way out by brushing off my concerns and simply topping off (overfilling as it turned out) my car's oil instead of doing the necessary service check they're supposed to do.  I've been driving with too much oil.  I'm dismayed because surplus oil can lead to engine damage which was done by BMW of Riverside.  I received:
- Poor customer service directly to me. Service reps and manager were patronizing and did not take the initiate or responsibility to get to the bottom of the problem until now.
- Bad servicing on my car that might have/has caused serious damage to the engine
I do not have confidence in BMW of Riverside to give me a straight answer nor to do a proper evaluation of a defective product and prevent major damage to the engine.< /Review>

I have been buying New BMW's from Riverside BMW since 1986. From a 735i to 750li and a M Roadster, 13 cars in all and never had a bad experience in all this time. John Horgan is simply the best service manager in the world.  Mark and Tye Gilbert are the best in sales of a car around. I go there just to visit with all the people. It is like Cheers with everyone knows your name. They all make you feel like you are the only customer that they have.  I can't say enough nice things about BMW of Riverside..</Review>

If I could give this establishment a -10 I would, unfortunately I can't.

My husband was working with the internet manager and had negotiated a price. The "manager" and my husband agreed to the sale. My husband informed the manager and director that he was out of town, and would be going in within a day to proceed with the deposit, down and complete the transaction, the manager agreed and basically said the car was sold to us.

The day prior to the set date my husband texted/emailed the "manager" informing him that he had everything ready to go for that Monday. We heard NO WORD back, until later that afternoon, ASTONISHINGLY informing us that the car that was said to be "sold" to US, had been SOLD to another buyer. This place LACKS integrity, professionalism and honesty. They are only out to make a quick sale. We ran credit, had the deposit and down ready, the only thing pending was my husband to walk into the store and complete the sale. What I still do not comprehend is the fact that the deal was negotiated and completed, AND YET WAS SOLD TO ANOTHER BUYER. The manager set the date to meet with my husband saying that their transaction was basically completed, but went BEHIND OUR BACKS and SOLD THE CAR to another buyer. NO INTEGRITY AND DEFINITELY NO PROFESSIONALISM. They didn't even try to fix their error and assists us with finding another car. They offered us a car with NOTHING COMPARABLE to what the initial car had, less options and basically not worth making a deal.

I would NEVER recommend anyone, not even my worse enemy to go here. We ended up going to Ontario BMW, and let me just say BIG DIFFERENCE. Ontario BMW made the smoothest transition, were honest and UPHELD integrity for the customer.  They even offered to look for the exact car we initially wanted.

DO NOT GO HERE !! THEY ARE SHARKS LOOKING FOR A QUICK SALE! DISHONEST, LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM AND NO INTEGRITY. IF YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF AND BE MISLED, THEN BY ALL MEANS WALK INTO RIVERISDE BMW, BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL GIVE YOU!

BMW ONTARIO IS THE WAY TO GO!< /Text>

Wife took the care and actually picked up a small toyota , nothing in comparison to my 535i, lol. Called about 2pm for we can pick up my car, was informed by Daisy the Service Rep. that since you took the car your service wouldn't be done until the end of the day??? I told her that wasn't acceptable and that I was told in would be done in 2 hrs. since we had an appointment, her response was that if it would be better I could pick my car up tomorrow.  Wow...In all fairness, we have been bringing by daughters, and my son's car to this BMW service area and have never had such a problem as we have had to day. This Daisy for service should be sent to training on how to provide excellent service instead of having attitude and the inability to solve service issues....< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I am from San Diego and talked to just about every BMW dealership from here until I ended up at BMW of Riverside, and experience the best customer service and smoothest car buying experience I have ever had. From the first visit to order my new car the time waiting for my car and my second visit to pick up my beautiful M235 everyone at BMW of Riverside made me feel like i belonged and was welcome there, everyone who passed by made sure i was being helped and offered me water, and/or coffee. Ammar Haque went above and beyond any other salesman i have dealt with, he had everything ready for me and all my services already submitted and ready to go. he made sure i was got what I wanted and that I was happy with what I got, and ensured I knew how to use all the gadgets and gizmos in my new car. He has even called me and emailed me multiple times to ensure everything was good. I would definitely go back even with the 2 hour drive, their superb service is worth the drive.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I have had my 2015 535d serviced here since i bought it in October. The service team here is great and so is my service advisor Carlos. They have been curtious and very helpful to my needs for the past year. However the technicians need some more training because they have messed up 3 times and now I am done with them. The first time they did not do the wheel alignment correctly, second time they forgot to add the diesel emmision fluid, and the third time they did not add the correct amount engine oil and it was low. Three strikes nd your out. Honestly this should not have happened at all when dealing with a BMW dealership. I will be going to Ontario from now on.< /Review>

Ammar Haque

Internet Sales Manager, BMW Riverside.

I want to thank Ammar for making the buying experience at BMW Riverside awesome! He took the time to answer all of my emails, phone calls, and my questions at the dealership. I would go back to him and BMW Riverside for my next car.

Thanks again Ammar, and keep up the good work!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>We are delighted to write a review of our experience at BMW of Riverside!   Due to limited availability of the car we wanted in our area, my wife and I traveled from North County San Diego to Riverside, and had the extreme pleasure of working with Sujan Ahmed on the lease of a 2015 328i Wagon.  For weeks leading up to the "big day" this past Saturday (9/19), Sujan made himself available to answer any and all questions we had during our decision making process.  He was patient and helpful, and when we arrived to Riverside BMW, practically all of the paperwork was ready to go.  The team in Finance was professional and efficient, and delivery of the (detailed & shiny) vehicle was a breeze.  In total, we spent only 1:40 on the Dealership lot -  from Test Drive to Drive Off - an amazingly short amount of time from beginning to end, if you think about it.

We will without doubt be back to see Sujan and the team there in Riverside for our next BMW purchase or lease.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Beware of  deceptive add-ons when purchasing your car.  My wife purchased the maintenance package when she purchased her  car and it was quite expensive for a short period of time.  That says something in itself if you tell me, for a low mileage car.  A couple of weeks later, she decided she did not want it and went to get her money back and was informed no refunds. She did not pursue it any further until about a year later when she was tired of taking it in for maintenance even though she rarely drove it.  When she was getting ready to just sell the car she was told once again she could not get a refund.  My wife called the BMW corporate office and spoke to Jennifer Wright.  She gave her instructions to give them a written letter and have them sign for it.  They also told her to speak with Chris Ruppert.  My wife spoke Chris Ruppert and James Johnston and they refused to take the letter as the corporate office instructed.  James Johnston pretty much called my wife a liar and that she did not speak with the corporate office.  BMW then gave my wife a document showing that there was a clause in the contract, which we were never given upon the purchase of the car.  The management at BMW of Riverside is deceptive in their business practices.   Look elsewhere if you are looking to get a BMW.  This is definitely not great customer services, but typical shady car dealership practices.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The worst thing is: the dealer just give us the bill until they finish fix the problem. Do they need to tell us the cost if there is any? How could they just charge the custom without ask them ahead of time?<//text>< pics>

It is a pre-owned car, but the car had always dreamed of and that was within my budget.
Indeed they had the car and the sales team  SUJAN and MARK. A friendly manner and professional
And without pressure they helped me realizer my dream.
Unfortunately, as can happen with a car and some miles. There was a problem in the navigation system.
But SUJAN and MARK were in charge of this problem with ROCHELEAU RYAN gave me support and professional service  we expect from a company like this.
I am very grateful to this great team of sales and service BMW of RIVERSIDE.
And I also want to thank the DIANA REQUENA kindly way I deal as professional and attentive giving me another car support to continue my work while my car was being repaired.

Yesterday I went in there to get a car fixed it took like 4 hours I wanted to look at cars that experience was not even a cent of gratitude towards by them not even helping except for myself to the work all by myself I asked for ziploc bags but that even took like 6 minutes plus how the service people acted wow I would even give that a 0% for the help I received in all fairness they honestly deserve a 5% of how they are and that if they keep on being this much hatred to every customer they should just go away so bmw what do you think is the problem me or u< /text>

<text>On Oct 17, we went into BMW to take a look at the new Grand Tourismo, we met with sales person Jamil, he was very pleasant and no pressure right from the begining. After a test drive, we ended up leaving a deposit for the vehicle, however we had decided also that we wanted to wait a while to purchase. Jamil gave me no pressure when I made this decision, however his management did call me back with a deal that we just could not pass up, and ended up picking up our Grand Tourismo on Friday the 19 it was a painless and quick purchase best buying experience we have had. I will definately refer people to Riverside BMW  all the staff was so welcoming and even more so to Jamil.
On a scale from 1 to 10 I give him a 12 he was awesome!!!!!!!!!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Deysy Hernandez was our sales person who assisted us.  She was very professional.  My husband and I had gone to a BMW dealer closer to home but were very disappointed in their sales staff and ended up not buying a car.  However we went to BMW of Riverside the next day and Deysy was exceptional.   One of the first things that my husband noticed was that once he said that I was the one getting the car, Deysy directed all her questions to me.  Unlike the wives of our friends that have gone to buy cars and found that the sales person always directed themselves towards the husband...not the wife buying the car.  Deysy was very informative and assisted us in test driving the car.   There was no hardline sales pitch which I appreciated and I was given more than enough time to discuss it with my husband.  After buying the car from them, I scheduled an appointment with Charyl Freeman, BMW Product Genius.  She was very patient with me as she taught me how to use the car with all of its' many features.  It was a lot of information that she shared with me but I was told that I was free to contact her at any time if I had any questions or I could even come back to get a refresher course.  I loved the fact that I could call or come back at any time.  It wasn't just a one-time thing.  I would highly recommend them if you are in the market to buy a BMW and be sure to ask for Deysy Hernandez!< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcb0f31d2c572b:0x100f16f9ce9ba1d6</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

THE ABSOLUTE ULTIMATE CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE !!!
My wfie had her heart set on a white or gray BMW X3.  I went on the website of our local dealership at Long Beach BMW where it showed the right one was in stock.  So we went there only to find out that the car was sold five days ago and the inventory on the website shows available vehicle at multiple stores and many are not available at that location.  So we left for Crevier where after spending much time there the price and payments were too high.  So I called a referral named Hoaie Luc.  He had called ahead and the Sales Manager greet us.    He called for Edwin the Salesman who had already started cleaning the car for us.  We got there at 5:50 pm and were driving off with the car my wife wanted for a $60 better payment than Crevier wanted to charge us and were out of Finance and on the road by 7:05 pm.   Wish I went here first.  I would have saved 7 hours of my day. Increadible deal,  Honest friendly people,  and and happy wife !!!!</Text>

This place is awful. Go elsewhere. They broke my car in several places during a recent service visit and refused to fix it. Common criminals if you ask me. One star is too much.</Review>

I went in for regular scheduled maintenance on my 328i (brake fluid, and oil gasket housing had a leak, all covered by warranty, i only paid a small deductible of $50 to replace it). I had to wait a short while for a loaner vehicle to become available so I can get back to work. The lady that helped me in the service department (sorry I forgot your name)was very apologetic that she did not have a fueled vehicle and that i had to fill it on my own, because there was no available gas cards to fuel the car. There was a little less than 1 notch left on the gas tank, but she comped me for free gas on my next service appointment. I didnt really care because the loaner car they gave me was a brand new 2014 535d diesel fuel twin turbo engine, so i was excited to drive it. Nick Cappellano was my service advisor and was very helpful, and alwats is every time I come in. He told me that my extendsed warranty was going to expire in just 6 months, so he went ahead and gave me an annual oil change just because he was worried that I wouldnt be able to get one later if my warranty expired. He also offered to help me look for third party warranty companies that will extend the warranty once it expires. When my car was ready for pickup, i came in to swap cars, and as I was walking out to my car, Nick caught up to me to tell me that he filled up my gas tank. I was super happy and wasnt even expecting it. They turned a small little gas issue into a remarkable experience overall. This really is a one of a kind service department and they bend backwards to make sure you leave happy. If any of my family or friends want to buy a BMW someday I'm going to make sure they come to this dealership, and no where else. I'm very lucky to have bought my car from here because they really take good care of me...and my car.< /text>

< Review>
I have tried to buy a BMW 528i. I agreed to the price they were selling for and was in the process of filling the BMW credit application and preparing other required documentation. I even gave my credit card information for a non-refundable $1000 deposit. I called the dealer again regarding a question on the forms I was filling and the dealer told me that the car has been sold. It was probably 15 minutes after I gave my credit card information. It appeared very unreasonable for them to sell the car when I agreed to buy the car at the price they have quoted. The person I was dealing with was Ammar Haque.

Also, I got a call from Ammar Haque's manager Anthony Caruso. He told me that the car was sold by another department; but Ammar Haque told me that he had sold the car himself to a customer. Their words are not even in sync. And when I told him that I would review the dealership, he said "We know how to respond to that".< /Review>

Paid 200 for them to misdiagnose my car and leave it dirty. They said that I needed to change the spark plugs and were trying to charge me almost 800 to do it. I took the car to another mechanic for a second opinion and they fixed my issue by putting in a new coil.< /text>

The service writer manager john is a racist and sexist, and all the women that work as the vehicle loaner rental agents act like jealous gossipy high school girls . the only great thing about this place is the new general manager from south Africa or europe cant pinpoint that accent but his kindness is so welcoming.<//text>

<Review>I come here to get my M4 serviced. The location is clean and friendly, Andrew here takes good care of me and listens to your concerns.

The only problem I see with this place is that their Car Wash is mediocre. I ask for their hand wash and the car doesn't come nice and shiny, there are often smudges and lacks that 2%. They are not a car wash shop so I can't complain too much but it does affect that BMW service feel.

I also had a problem getting a BMW rental. I went there to get my M4 serviced and they rented me a Hyundai. I laughed it off but it was definitely a negative point.

Call them early to get your loaner and I suggest asking for the hand wash since I've had bad experience with Walter Mercedes across the street (sister company) and got mom's E series scratched up (and they rejected any responsibility).< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

< Review>
I changed the tires, the car on the way home was unstable skidding almost crashed, I asked the attendant to go back to ask the waiter she told me everything is no problem, she said no problem just check my computer maintenance records on the computer, I again drove away to the other Tire service shop because BMW service department mistook the size of the tire I want to replace, irresponsible maintenance staff, poor attitude, I vowed not to re-enter the BMW< /Review>

<text>I went there to pick my car up after service, it took them 45 minutes to bring the car to me.  The car was dirty and covered with bird poop all over.  I asked them how come the car is in such condition, to which they replied that we washed it last night.  I had to ask them to wash the car again and wait another 20 minutes for the car.< /text>< date>
