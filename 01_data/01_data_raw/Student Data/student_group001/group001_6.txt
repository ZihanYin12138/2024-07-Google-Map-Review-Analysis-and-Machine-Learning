Location:Very Good, Parking:Good, Service type: Fast food order with ability to eat in. Very busy, line out the door, workers were nonstop. Price for food Value, Very Good you definitely get your money's worth. Overall: what a change from the food service they replaced. The choices ordered  today were well worth the line I stood in. I look forward to trying more options in the coming weeks...</Review>

First off. I think the location is perfect, I did like the aesthetic look of the place. Really nice colors. I thought the service was great. The mac and cheese with brisket on top was pretty good. I thought the food was okay. Not amazing enough for me to make the drive to come back down. I do like older options. They do have a salad option if you want something lighter in the menu. Food is pretty greasy.<//text>

<Rate>2</Rate><resp>None<//resp><review>After trying their vegan sando, I can say they definitely need to learn how to properly prepare their oyster mushrooms before frying them. Never leave the freaking connected by their stems, and ever deep fry the whole stem. That part of the mushroom is wholly inedible, and completely ruins the dish, sandwich. I know it isn't their specialty, but if it is going to be on the menu, at least learn how to properly prepare it.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The line was super long, like I expected for opening weekend. It went so fast. I was amazed. They really have the line down! The staff was so friendly. The food was amazing. My son got a milkshake and it was above and beyond anything we have ever seen! My Nashville hot chicken burrito had an abundance of flavor. We will definitely be going back. Great food, awesome ambience and super friendly and attentive staff!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

We enjoyed out first visit, Abe the manager and his staff offered great service. Use the cash line to get your order faster. we enjoyed Brisket and mac, plenty for 2, especially to save room for the mud charcoal shake for dessert.</review>

Wow! This was my Father's day brunch and it was AWESOME! I had The MAC-RIB and not only was the bbq delicious there was a well seasoned burger in the lower half. We will definitely dine here in the future.</Review>

On the second day of opening there was not a long wait. Service was exceptional as was the food. I ordered the brisket mac sandwich with brisket mac and cheese. My wife ordered the brisket grilled cheese. We must say by far the best bbq in the country. We are truck drivers and have tried bbq all over and this is the best hands down. On the way out the general manager made it a point to find out our experience and a very nice gentleman he is.  Thank you all so much we will definitely be back.</text>

The dopest, most flavorful, illest, dank spot you'll ever pass by. Dont just pass by. Stop and grab something. That mac rib has me drueling. But the Nashville fries are straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. No doubt. A true must have. Enjoy</review>

I was rush to take my order plus my chicken was so full of salt it was so much salt in my chicken and my mash potatoes and gravy it was very bad to eat my food if I wouldn't have been rushed to make my order I would have made another choice on the menu. K F C needs to stop putting so much salt in their food....

<Review>I ordered 10 chicken wings from these guys, but instead of 10 they put eight pieces in a box!  The sauce is not offered, he came up and ordered honey from them himself, and instead of honey he gives mayonnaise!  The kitchen is very dirty and scary, and under their feet there is a bucket of rubbish !!!  It turns out that this change, From good brands of the restaurant turned into not a decent trash for the homeless ... I do not advise to dedicate this room!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXfCKXUX54YmygcTOtyh4nE8XNWqkH4qckuHAz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM92BwnC3nnZEs3XpmcYWLKY3OX2wSiqd9ZvMJZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I had a terrible rude experience at the KFC located on sutterville rd. The person who took my order had a negative aggressive attitude saying she couldn't take my order because she had no change. When I stated I would take coin change. She denied she had any change. I felt she just didn't want to take my order.< /Review>< Response>

It was alright. On multiple occasions they forgot our sauce, even after reminding them. And sometimes they take a little longer than needed to get through people in the line. But the food is great and most of the time they get us what we ordered very quickly.</text>

<review>Ordered a 8 piece chicken didn't get the full chicken. They always leave out  the chicken brest and instead will include other pices to make the 8. A 8 piece should be the whole chicken not 4 wings, not 4 drumsticks  ect. Why dont they do 4 chicken brests instead then??? Im not satisfied with my order!< /review>< userid>

I don't usually rate places, but this one deserves to be posted.

At the end of a very long, terrible work week I needed a late lunch on Saturday. This area doesn't have much to choose from so I picked A&W. Worst hamburger and fries I think I've ever had. The fries were chewy despite being hot. They tasted stale. The hamburger was the same. The burger was smashed into less than half the thickness of the photo on the menu. The patty was chewy and tough.

I think this was the burger joint in the movie "Falling Down" and I fully understand the plot now.

Nice first impression. Not trying that out again.</Text>

Ice cream (this one in particular is an a&w as well)... tonight we went there and they were OUT OF FOOD!!  How can you be OUT OF FOOD ALL TOGETHER?! It's angering... I think we have finally had enough of this establishment and will take our business elsewhere permanently. I suggest everyone else do the same. If you don't have food to sell then you don't need patrons to sell "nothing" to.< /Review>< pics>

Horrible KCF. How is that your sides are automatically decided and have to order extra sides or talk to a manager in order to change the sides to the ones you actually want??? First KFC I've ever been to that's like this.</review>

Just...wow... If I was the food inspector or even a corporate personal, this location would be in trouble.. Trash everywhere, dirty floors, dirty tables, chairs not pushed in, trash not emptied..and that's just the customer area!
Order counter tops messy and dirty, staff not happy to work or help. Food pieces on the counter left there and so much trash on their floor.. Staff only focus on drive thru and even then get orders wrong...and chicken very dry.. ONLY reason I've gone is for a good coupon...Staff and management at this location seriously do not care about the KFC integrity.. Not many locations in this area do...<//Text>

<Text>This is the dirtiest kfc I haver ever went to. Girls at the cashier are immature and don't have good customer service. All the tables were dirty and crumbs and trash everywhere on the floor. The door and Windows were filthy and so were the soda machines. You can tell it hasn't been wiped down for days! Seriously, nobody even cared to clean up. My husband had to go tell someone that they need to clean.I didn't even feel comfortable to eat in there. Whatever you do, DON'T GO THERE. If they can't keep KFC clean, how do you think they are making your food!?! Yuuuuck!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This has got to be the worst KFC I have ever gone to!

Service was slow!

No sense of urgency among any employee that I saw working there!

I didn't hear any apologies to those who were waiting forever to get there order!

I was stupid enough to wait in line for 20 minutes to find out that they didn't have what I wanted to order!

...and these people are going to be getting paid $15 per hour in the next few years? God help us all

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention all the people that were honking in the drive-through line.

I can't wait to hear what the KFC corporate office going to say about this< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809acfc7de5aab8b:0xabf490355a39bed7< /GmapID></record>

Very very slow.  Had 5 people ahead of me and it took 15 mins before they took my order,  then it took 10 mins to  complete my order.  Drive thru was much faster,  so if you go here (which I don't recommend)  then go threw the drive-thru<//text>

This place is great in terms of picking up and dropping with a short turn around time. The only issue is the person that delivers is obviously a smoker and my personal laundry bags which I bought specifically for this delivery purpose come back smelling like cigarettes. Luckily the smell doesn't get inside and affect my clothes but it's still gross to have to bring in something that reeks into your home. Also, they kind of fold haphazardly. Maybe I'm just too picky when I fold and make sure sheets etc line up. Not a huge deal but I do have to refold them.< /Text>

<Text>Very disappointed in how services were handled with regard to my clothing being washed incorrectly to the point of being discolored and as a professional myself I understand how things can happen beyond your control. However, customer service  is providing a service beyond expectation. Why was I not compensated automatically? I'm still waiting for someone to take the initiative and make  it right< /Text>< pictures>

Wash club is my greatest discovery of the year! The most amazing service ... they pick up and deliver at your house, always on time, great communication, clean laundry, folded and wrapped neatly!
This is a Godsend for working moms, busy dads, workaholic new grads, maybe even for students in a dorm, washer-dryer breakdowns, and just the laundry overwhelmed Bay area resident!
Pros: fast, affordable, easy, great results!  Cons: None!<//Review>

<text>THEY LOST OUR CLOTHES!!! Said they were probably delivered to another customer and to keep our fingers crossed that they’ll be returned. BEWARE!! My maternity dresses are gone and my husbands dress shirts are gone. They don’t make the reimbursement process to cover their mistakes easy either. They told us that we had to retrieve every receipt with a date at the top and credit card transactions to verify that we actually purchased items in order to get a reimbursement. Oh and their preferred method of reimbursement is in their own store credit. Lol!! AS IF WERE EVER GOING TO USE THEM AGAIN!!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and use a different wash and fold service.</text>< Pics>

Pari was great and he was more than professional and polite.    I though  good customer service  was dead, NOT.  My laundry was done on time , folded perfectly in 24 hours and on my way.   Can not be happier.  Please come to Contra Costa soon
Happy.<//Review>

The only thing I would critique is that use way too much paper to wrap the clothes. I nearly fill up an entire recycle bin every time.< /text>< Pics>

Prompt service, friendly delivery/pick-up people, quick turn-around and the best prices to be found anywhere! I really liked my experience with Washclub Bay Area and will use them exclusively as my cleaners. They ARE the best!</text>

<Review>I was looking for a billiards place that allowed minors (my youngest is 12) to enter and I found this place. Four of us got a table for $15/hr and we played a while and had a great time. It wasn't crowded at all, music played all the while, and it wad a lot of fun. The tables are good. I don't remember if they serve food but some packaged snacks are available. We will definitely return.< /Review><Rate>4</Rate><name>Chad Zuber<//name><UserId.>107937530178718975094<//UserId.>< GmapID>

The staff is very nice and so is the atmosphere. There are a lot of tables, good music playing, and nice lighting.

The price however was pretty high at $15/hr and the tables need to be resurfaced.

It's an overall good place if money and quality of tables is not an important issue.</review>

If you like pool this IS the place.  Clean.  Good tables.  Plus two DIAMOND tables. They charge a bit more for diamond.  Nice people.  Not crowded at all.  Took my 17yo son here and had a good time.  Would definitely come back again< /Review>

Nice atmosphere and 12 tables(2 are Diamond LV Competition tables). Bit pricey, $15 per table(not person) per hour($20/hr for Diamond). Overall a solid spot for a group to play some good ole Billiards. Subtle Location next to Papa Johns and 711.<//review>

Very clean establishment. Looks like a family run business and they all seem to be nice enough people. Seems to me they could take a few tables out and make a little more room because I've never seen it crowded enough to warrant so many tables. Nice place to take the family and do something a little different.< /Text>

<text>Pool tables are in excellent condition however they are bunched together which ultimately means be aware of other pool gamers around also no food or alcohol selection just snacks. Also I noticed that you can hear everyone's conversation around you low music and prices are high. Unfortunately won't be coming here again until a change has been made.< /text>< time>

Cool poolhall. All ages and pretty decent price. Not a great snack selection. The tables are full size and they're plenty of decent cues to select from.</text>

First off the owner needs a little more training in customer service. I had just finished my job for the day and was going to meet some friends to play some pool i arrived first and needed to use the bathroom as i entered cues i started for the bathroom thats when i encountered the owner of cues he asked me if  i was there with someone and i said no then he rudely asked "then what are you doing" and i said that i was going to use the bathroom and before i could say anything else he yells no the bathroom is not for the public I've never been more discussed with a business owner in my life just because i decided to try and use the bathroom before i rented a table the owner assumed i wasn't there to play so he used to embarrassing and humiliation tactics in front of the custumers to get me to leave and you know what it work and will never step foot in that place again and would hope that no one else would want to play pool in a place where you have to worry if your going to be the next person to get verbally attacked by the owner i recommend that nobody go to this place to show him that this is what happens when you treat your customers this way.</text>

<username>Alex Nazarie< /username><text>A little pricey, 20$/hr for a good table, 15$/hr for a not so good table. The cues are a little sub par for a pool hall and the balls have some chips in them. But it's also the only pool hall in town so for having zero competition, it's not too bad.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80db8aa52968132b:0x24e7a1e7abab26ad</Gmap_id>< Rating>

I called my buddy to ask if he wanted to play pool at 7:15. Drove to his house to pick him up then headed to the pool hall and played one game. When we left the guy up front charged me for a half hour and said we had been there since 7:10. When I realized what had happened I confronted the guy and he gave me a few dollars back but did not own up to the mistake.

I used to love going in and playing one game every once in a while. It totally ruins the experience getting ripped off even once.</Review>< pics>

There are fake reviews here, i have been to all the pool halls in the area and Cues is the most expensive all you have to do is call the others and ask price and you'll see. The room is just big enough to fit the tables, not great for a hangout. No bar, no food beside bottled soda and chips and cany bars.< /Text>

Mom and pop pet food and supply store that carries some food and other item brands not carried by your big corporation pet store.  Parking is easy.  Owners and staff are nice. I go here for my dogs pet-food. Selection of variety isn't as big as a big corporate pet store but that is to be expected. I know exactly what I am going to get for my dog when I go here. Prices aren't bad--not going to be the cheapest..say for pet toys and stuff like that but they have the essentials and I like support info small businesses so I shop here when I can and go to the big P stores for the rest.<//Review>

Today there was a different person working there,  I asked for his name and he said"Im not going to tell you". Well service was not good to tell the truth he actually told me; that I can't buy there if I don't wear a mask. This is how Tyranny starts. (Remember WW2, ) We are losing our rights given to us by our CREATOR, ...I'm a Disable Veteran and can't wear a mask....CDC states anyone whom has a disability doesn't need to wear a mask.. I will report this to the state and city.  My Constitutional rights were VIOLATED!!!!< /text>

Come here and enjoy service from the nicest guy in town!   He also responds to your needs-  He got some special chicken feed i wanted and he carried the 50 lb bag to the vehicle! Ha!  We have needed a specialty pet store here for a long time and we finally got it!  C & C Pet Food!<//review>

<text>I love this place! Every time I go in, everyone is so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The owners are usually there and really understand how to take care of customers. They gave me a can of cat food once for my cats to try. The prices are reasonable, selection is great and the store is neat and well-organized. I never need to go back to Petco.< /text>< date>

I love this place. I've been coming here for a few years for waxing with Julia and massages with Tip. My friend and I make it a girls' night once a month now, with 90-minute massages and dinner afterward. It is always amazing. The spa is beautiful, calm, friendly, quiet, all the nice words... and the staff are incredibly skilled. It's a real oasis in Hollywood. If you go, do yourself a favor and get the 90-minute massage -- it's totally worth it.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Great place that lives up to its name. It's a day spa experience with excellent massages. Each room has all you need for a great experience, hot towels and pillows as well as a heating closet for your robe.

I'm sure you've read through a few other reviews or checked the website for what amenities there are here, so I won't repeat that. But just know there is a lot of pampering for you and you'll leave feeling refreshed and clean.

Showers can be a bit finicky with the sudden temperature changes which was surprising, but other than that it's a top quality place.< /text>< Pics>

I waited months to review because I was so upset. It’s inside the mall but I was having trouble finding it. I called and was still on hold 15 minutes later. I arrived 10 minutes late and even though I explained the situation and there were no appointment bookings after mine, my time was cut. The massage wasn’t the greatest and was a waste of time and money. The 4 receptionists at the desk wanted me to tip before the service was completed which was odd.< /text>

Great experience as usual! Unwind with a spa day at BWSF. They have got you covered! Stay all day or just an hour,  either way you'll leave feeling at least slightly refreshed.  Dont forget to eat before and after, because during your stay they only have water, tea and apples.  If you are fasting,  you have nothing to worry about.  :)< /review>

The most wonderful Spa in the city of San Francisco and they have an amazing staff that lives to please you! A wonderful relaxing environment starting with the Whirlpool baths and then the amazing very professional masseuse. The interior architecture is something to take in and it's wonderful to be able to sit in front of a warm fireplace waiting to be given any type of Massage you can conjure up!</Review>

Good spa facilities, though I wouldn't call them upscale, as they describe themselves. Clean and overall good massages, though quality of massage will vary from therapist to therapist. A bit pricey, but it's the Bay Area.< /Text>

<Review>What an incredible experience. I feel like a new person! The services available before and after the treatments were such a wonderful touch. Vivian was an amazing esthetician, I felt so comfortable and taken care of, and she was so nice to talk to for the hour. My skin feels brand new, and she even offered me some tips for how to maintain great skin after leaving! Pam was a wonderful massage therapist she was so communicative with me and made sure everything was the right pressure and temperature. She also gave me some exercises to do at home to help loosen my muscles. And last but not least Blanca was such an attentive and meticulous nail artist. Her massage on my legs honestly rivaled the actual massage I had gotten earlier that day. I cannot wait to come back to this spa.< /Review><user>108367093851119101562< /user><GmapID>0x808580866c2989cb:0x3b091e4d200f10c0< /GmapID>< pictures>

<Review>Don't spend your money here. I had a really great experience years ago and then came back....I was rushed, had a horrible 50 minute massage, where I was repeatedly scratched on my fingers and scalp.  I basically wanted to say, "Could you NOT do that please!??" At the beginning of my massage I was asked which parts of my body were ailing me  and I told the lady that I am a dog walker and am constantly on my feet,  my sciatic, my lower back and hip area. After 50 minutes she worked out sombre knots in my neck and that was that. My feet, lower back,  and glut area had not been touched for a second. I'm wondering if she misunderstood me because she did not speak English very well. It seemed like she was overworked and was hurrying to get it over. I've had massages, many of them,  and this was horrible. Very sad< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
This review is mostly for the nail salon.
All the associates I encountered were friendly and accommodating. The spa was clean, stocked ( although there was no signature tea or lemonade)  and lit appropriately, dark and relaxing.  I mentioned lighting bec the nail salon is in contrast of the spa/common area. The nail salon was brightly lit, it was difficult for me to relax. The chairs was not as comfortable as I'm used to w other salons and the décor was non existence which made worst by the blinding brightness of the room and the white paint. Maybe they were going for a 1950 "hospital" ambiance? The pedicure was 50 minutes but I did not feel pampered for some reason. It was a "dry" pedicure meaning, they don't soak your feet in water. They do wrap it in towel and steam it. The attendant was attentive and realize the steamer was too hot and turned it down. The foot massage was NOT very good and was very short. The oils they used was unscented. She did mentioned that my feet was dry and offered enhancements for a fee, I declined. The pedicure cost me $58 plus tip. Besides the pleasant attendants, the whole experience was not worth $58. There's a lot of nail salons within 3 blocks that offers a more enjoyable experience for half the price. I usually fall asleep at other nail salons bec it's a relaxing experience.  My nails did look great afterwards hence 2 stars instead of 1. I wouldn't use this service again unless its  free or part of a deal.</Review>

<Review>Each time I visit Burke Williams, I'm reminded of what a great place it is to get pampered in the heart of downtown San Francisco. The ladies at the front desk are welcoming with great energy. If you schedule an appointment, it's best to arrive at least 30 minutes early so you can take advantage of their spa facilities before your appointment. You can even hang out after your appointment! The moment you walk in, you will feel at ease, peaceful and relaxed. The prices are high but worth it if you do it occasionally.

Like: The free amenities - plush towels and robes, showers, etc. The sauna and steam room, large hot tub! They give you frozen grapes to nosh on, ice cold face towels, and plenty of water. You can enjoy the amenities before your service or after
Just ok: I got a massage here twice and they definitely didn't hit my target spots. Actually the second time I went here they had no female masseuses available so I got a male and he was great!
You're definitely paying for the amenities and extra services, but if you want a massage only, hopefully you'll find someone you really like - or just go somewhere else that's cheaper< /Text>

The towels are plush and plentiful. There is a dry sauna, steam room, hot tub, quiet room with reclining chairs and magazines, and cool misting room for each gender, and a communal living room with fireplace. It's a bummer that you can hear the mall music in the living room.

The bathrooms have anything you could need -  razors, cotton balls, brushes, make up remover etc.

I used to get a monthly facial, and once tried a peel, and my coworkers said my skin was glowing.

For special occasions you can bring in a treat that they will serve on a cute platter. For my cousin's birthday they gave her a complimentary service upgrade.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This is the ultimate spa experience. The spa is conveniently located on the top floor of the Westfield mall, next to the movie theater.  It's always busy here but the facility is large enough that you can find a room where no one is in. This location has a jacuzzi, wet room, sauna, and steam room. It has 5 showers and has a fully stocked vanity room. Oh and there is a quiet room where you can take a power nap in. The attendants come by with frozen grapes or frozen juice bars. And there is a variety of lemonade, spa water, and tea. Definitely worth splurging for a girls day or a me day!<//Text>

<Text>Best visited if you plan on taking advantage of the shared spa facilities of jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Was delighted to find the sauna functioned and had a bucket of water with which to properly löyly; however I was thrown off by another guest who brought her iPhone into the sauna with her- this speaks not only of a laxity of common area rules enforcement but seriously how many brain cells do you have think it is a good idea to haul a piece of personal electronics into a room where you literally splash water around to raise humidity?</Text>< Date>

<Review>If I could review with negative stars, I would. When given a tour of the facilities, as we approached the locker rooms through the lounge, I mentioned that I need to go through the men's room. The manager taking me on a tour then asked me what was on my driver's license and that I would have to use whichever facilities matched my drivers license. I was embarrassed and furious. I will not work here nor receive services here. I will be attempting to make the space trans-friendly so no one else will have to go through what I went through. This is an example of how they are not fully committed to their own statement, "It is our goal to create and maintain an environment where both our guests and our employees always feel respected, valued and safe."<//Review><name>Jae DK Szeszycki-Truesdell< /name><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pics>

Burke Williams is a lovely facility and my deep tissue massage by Jodi was excellent. But the spa itself is overpriced and it's hit or miss in services: the previous massage and facial I got there were only okay. I think I paid more than $180 for a 50 minute deep tissue.

I went there early in the morning and was confused why I couldn't enter through the main mall entrance. I called the spa and the lady at the desk picked up and told me to hold. I held for 5 minutes before giving up and hanging up on her. I found the solution eventually by wandering around the building. Turns out you need to go around to the mission street bloomingdales entrance, find an intercom, tell security you're there, and they'll let you in so you can ride the elevator up.

To its credit, it's a great place for a girl's spa day. It has a large jacuzzi/pool area (bring swimsuits if you're shy or you can go in in the buff) and a nice sauna room. You can chat, but some people get annoyed and point to the "quiet" signs. It was surprisingly packed even early at 8 am in the morning. Snacks include extremely cucumber-y water everywhere in abundance and apples.

There's also a sample bar - where if you're cheap like me... you can fill up on products and give yourself a facial in the bathroom. I especially love the smell of their cleanser. The eye moisturizer pills up and didn't sit well under eyeshadow.<//Text>

I went for a manicure and had a really terrific manicurist which is the only reason they got any stars at all. It was pretentious and way too expensive. This is the first time I have ever been asked for photo id (!) to have a manicure.  At $40 plus a 20% tip this was more than double what I usual pay and it is chipping less than 36 hours later.</review>

Cool local spa. Unfortunately SF is in a sad state of affairs for the quality of spas. In Las Vegas, this place would star a 2. Here, it stars a 4. Services are decent, as are amenities - nothing to brag about, but good for SF.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>The absolute worst. First of all let me state I rarely complain and have never posted a negative review until now. I am the type of person who prefers to reach out to management or owners if I need to.  As a business owner myself I would like to opportunity to hear what my clients think and come up with amicable resolutions. After reaching out to BW management I am compelled to let anyone interested in doing business with Burke Williams know about my experience.  I have been a loyal member for over 4 years. Not only did I enjoy the spa I recommended it to absolutely everyone. I was just looking at my account and realized my membership increased from $109 to $172 in one month. I called assuming this was a mistake. After 30 minutes of being put on hold I was told that this was the ‘new’ price for my existing membership and I could either cancel or pay. (WHAT?) When I inquired further regarding the new terms of my membership and 57% increase; the member services represented said they are doing this because they can and it’s in the fine print of my contract". She apologized and stated her days have been filled with unhappy clients calling to inquire about this increase and she really had no explanation other than the owner made a unilateral decision. After pressing further I was told that Burke Williams is aggressively expanding, busy and did not need to retain old clients who were grandfathered into the original contract terms, (I wish I had taped this conversation I just could not believe what I was hearing).  They also stated it would not be worth writing a letter or trying to reach out to higher level of management or the owner to discuss because they just did not care. (I was shocked) She said they were prepared to lose their loyal clients because they just didn't need them any more. I have never heard of such blatant disregard for customer care. To add insult to injury I asked if I could be transferred to someone who could better provide more details regarding this matter. She said she would ‘try’.. and then the call was dropped. I called back and the next representative told me the exact same things about the price change. She said she could keep transferring me but I would just end up back to the same call center. I was basically told to give up.

To alienate those who were “grandfather” into the original membership is just bad business.  I do understand the need to increase prices and am happy to go along with reasonable increases over time. It is the 57% jump in one month and the transparency regarding the owner (Bill) attitude regarding client retention that is appalling. Needless to say when I enquired today in person (I had a service already booked and paid for) I got the same response from the lovely ladies at the front desk. They seem to be put in a very awkward and uncomfortable position and embarrassed. They did give me Bill’s email but assured me he would not respond and did not care. I am super bummed because I really, really liked the spa but if this is the underbelly of what is behind the façade I am happy to take my business elsewhere and you should to. Shame on you Bill.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808580866c2989cb:0x3b091e4d200f10c0< /gmap_id></record>

Stay away at all costs. Mediocre services, horrendous, near nonexistent customer service. Spend your $$$ and time elsewhere. Never again.</Review>

<Review>I like utilizing the facilities here rather than splurging on a massage.  You can swim, steam, sauna, and relax for very cheap.<//Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) At first, I was invited to drink tea and consulted about service packages and then went to changing rooms and sending goods. Pedicure and massage your hands before Next is oiled sunflower and take steps foot massage After foot massage will be ice cold, massage again and ending shoulder massage nape neck I'm very satisfied with the services and staff cute, gentle and gentle teacher ️ Before going home, I was invited to drink tea again but I was in a hurry so I didn't drink.

(Original)
Đầu tiên mình được mời uống trà và tư vấn về các gói dich vụ sau đó lên phòng thay và gửi đồ. Ngâm chân và massage tay trước Tiếp theo là bôi dầu hướng dương và thực hiện các bước massage chân Sau khi massage chân sẽ được chườm đá nóng, massage lần nữa và kết thúc là massage vai gáy cổ Mình rất hài lòng với dịch vụ và nhân viên, ngoan hiền trắng trẻo nhẹ nhàng dễ thương ️  Trước khi ra về minh được mời uống trà lần nữa nhưng đang vội nên ko uống.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Park has a pleasant manner and is very particular with his exams and future treatments that he may suggest. I will make an appointment for my husband to see Dr. Park- I know he will like him and his office staff. We are
new to California and feel fortunate to have found an excellent Doctor.</review><time>1627773456995< /time></record>

Oh my..it has taken me three years to find a local dentist.. I hit the jackpot with Dr Park and his staff! Professional and on time. Additionally I appreciated the "bedside manner" of Dr Park. He discussed what was happening with my procedure as he progressed through treatment. I'm sensitive to cold and water, however I had no pain! Adriana was also a delight! Explained my out of pocket costs and answered my questions thoroughly. Beautiful modern facility with plenty of parking. Easy to schedule an immediate appointment.  I first scheduled due to a dental emergency and was seen right away!!  I'd call this Dental office the BEST of BEAUMONT! Thank you Dr Park and team!</Text>

Dental assistants were very thorough in explaining each step of my visit with me and my concerns. The dentist also listened to my concerns and explained my options. So far I’m satisfied since this is my first visit. Dental office is also not as crowded as some of the others I’ve used in the past because of it being a new building👍 I can only give four stars for now since I have not had treatment as of yet.</text>

I visited Doctor Park for a simple tooth extraction. The first thing I noticed about his office is that they double book appointment times. This isn't that bad, I understand how some procedures are a quick in-n-out process. But his office knew weeks ahead of time that I was coming in for this extraction and still double booked. To make things worse he did not finish the job, left one root in. The only explanation he offered at the moment was that he simply didn't have time for it. His office referred me to another dentist that would not be able to see me for over a month later. By that time bone shards had begun to protrude from my gum causing discomfort. I understand that bone fragments are a normal part of the healing process but no one warned me about this when the referral for the next doctor was made. Now the dentist Dr. Park referred me to, who seemed rather surprised that Dr. Park sent me his way, is referring me to an oral surgeon in order to remove the root and clean up the bone fragments that were left behind. While all the staff and Dr. Park himself were very polite and professional, it does not matter much in the end if you do not finish the job and leave a bit of a mess behind.<//Text>

<text>My first visit to Dr. Park today. Was a great experience. He is very patient reassuring and explains what work is needed and why . His new office is beautiful. Everything is kept clean, and all safety precautions are taken. All his dental staff are friendly helpful and cheerful.  So if your anxious and fear the dentist, they are great at putting you at ease and making you comfortable.   Dr. Park  👍👍<//text>< Rating>

Gentle, professional staff.
Many years at this location, BUT a brand new state of the art facility.
Everyone on the staff here puts out a caring persona.
I felt relaxed and cared for!  I drive 40+ miles to the office.  Our family of 4 ALL have their dentistry here.
I'm on the list for 2 bridges and a replacement Crown.< /text>

<text>I chose Dr. Park after another local dentist (initially assigned by my insurance) attempted to "monetize" my teeth and charge me for problems I did not have. Dr. Park was honest, caring, and efficient, and took care of the one major problem area I had. Now my teeth are healthy and looking great again. I am so glad I chose Dr. Park for that second opinion, and beyond!<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
First vist ever, the place looks great, and the staffing are really nice and "cool." They are really thorough about their policies and fees. I decided to chose this spot because my regular dentist is back up til August. I'm not familiar with the fees and how much is overcharged or under charged, all know is that my insurance takes a good portion of it. And that is why we pay an arm and leg for healthcare. Hopefully this helps.<//Review>

Dr. Park is very gentle and helpful.  I have been to some dentist in the past that were very heavy handed & was in pain the moment they started working on my tooth, not Dr. Park.  I have referred him to a few friends & they love him too</Review>

I was looking for parts or a replacement char grill and my contact was Vince @ the store manager but he definitely lacks   In following up with customers and just doesn’t respond emails; calls or messages.
Definitely don’t recommend this particular place<//Text>

<review>The staff here is so helpful. It definitely feels more industrial, but if you're looking for things that are of that nature, this is it. They also have a great knife selection, as well as industrial stoves, and cake decorating supplies.</review><user_id>112173728126243666559</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Staff at check in desk very nice and helpful..

Not a long wait  to be seen but the staff kept apologizing.  Tv was on and chairs were spread out safe social distance and everyone was wearing a 😷 mask.   Made my visit very comfortable and I felt safe</text>

The staff here were very kind and the got to me quickly. I was there for a drug test (urine) and the cups they use have a portion at the bottom that is thicker than the rest of the cup and I believe it gave my sample a low temperature reading. Good for me the nurse transferred it to a different container and the reading came out fine. Another nurse may not have been as experienced and recorded a negative reading for someone.
Overall it is a well ran facility.< /text>

I was on hold for over 12 minutes while on phone .
Their EKG machine broken no one knew how to resolve issue I was laying there shirtless for over 20 minutes with door open.
Blood couldn’t be drawn due to inexperienced tech had to drive to laboratory
In all my total wait time exceeded 2 hours - I had to leave my room a look for nurse once and another time had to physically go and search for doctor< /text>

<Text>Caught you guys on a busy day but you seemed to handle it well for the amount of staff you had. Loved the mobile paper work on phone! No more 2 -5 papers to fill out before your even acknowledged! Actually the people at the counter were friendlier. You would get 5 stars if you had more staff.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Fast service from the time that I signed in, to the time that I was called in for my physical exam. The Physician who served me was very friendly, and performed the exam with precision. I’m very satisfied with the service!!< /text>

I did not feel that the Dr. was prepared to see me. He didn't have any idea what my injury was. And he got the information from the case manager that was with me. And she seems to be wanting for me to be released before I am prepared and ready for it.< /review>

I recently visited the location in Gardena, CA. for a pre-employment screening. It was an inviting and pleasant experience. From the moment of being greeted by the front desk to the staff in the medical office everyone was warm and professional. Guidelines are being followed for COVID19 protocol and I did not feel uncomfortable. Would definitely recommend this organization for any work related issues.<//text>

Very unpleasant visit! I had to get it done.. The guy who called me, don't know his name,  know one wore a badge! He didn't wash his hands after collecting a specimen. He express wearing gloves was good enough..During my Dr. Visit during my exam he assure me he wash his hands? During my visit i felt unease and ready to leave. The doctor during his exam touch the bottom of my shoes and then came back to touch my arms..! I felt dirty and disrespected!! If u can pls don't go to this facility..<//Text>

< Review>
My experience here was horrible. No one told me their names the whole time I was there or their job title. No one washed their hands. From the moment I walked in. No one greeted me as I stood by the counter. The front desk person answered three phone calls back to back never once stopping to acknowledge me. I didn't want to be a bother or seem impatient so I sat down. 30 minutes later a different person sat down at the reception desk and I asked him for some help. I was told to sign in and he took my ID. After filling out forms I was called in. The guy who called me in gave a run down of my exams and said I had a physical. I told him I hadn't come for a physical and he gave an assertive tone and told me, "Well you're getting one today."  I had to call my agency to confirm with Concentra that I was in fact not getting a physical that day. He then took me to my drug screening and rushed through that completely  . Everytime I tried to ask him a question he would speak over me, every single time. Even after asked me to answer one of his questions as I began to answer he would speak over me. I then had my blood draw the, the woman who drew my blood the first time said, "hello, are you you a hard stick?" I asked her in return was she good at drawing blood. She missed my vein and spent the next 2 minutes after that digging into my arm time and time again trying to find the vein with the needle plunged into my arm. She barely hit the vein, got a flush and then started saying I was a slow draw over and over. She gave up and sent another woman. The second woman was unsuccessful after sticking me in a spot on my arm no one has ever stuck me for a vein. Finally they sent the only person who helped me fill out my papers and he got a nice healthy flowing vein in less than a minute.  My other tests were succesful. Today I found out that my job screening has been delayed because the man who took my drug test administered a 7 panel test instead of the 10 panel test that was written down on my referral and was also verbally confirmed. My experience at this facility was highly stressful, disrespectful, painful and it delayed my employment. I'm unsatisfied, completely.<//Review>

<review>Clean, professional, and expedient. Visited here recently and was more than satisfied with my appointment. Staff was very polite as well as urgent in regards to getting patients signed in, seen, and released. Thank you!<//review>< Name>

Went for an employment physical, they were fast and efficient. During the physical, the doctor demonstrated what I was to do before I actually did it. It was an awesome experience.< /Text>

<Review>My husband went in for his appt. and we were both surprised with the the level of service. We have been to a few of these clinics and haven’t received the best of service. However, we were both surprised at the level of customer service this clinic provided. The Doctor was great! Really caring and patient with my husband.  The staff overall was really friendly and accommodating as well. Rosalie and Claudia were very helpful and patient. Not like other clinics we’ve been too. If you need to go to USHW for whatever reason....GO HERE! :)<//Review>< time>

I used to send my employees to US Healthworks, but things have changed now that it is Concentra.  There are no Doctors!  These clinics are ran by assistants!  Is that even legal!?!  Needless to say, I am transferring my account to another clinic, where I can speak to an actual Medical Doctor regarding my employee's healthcare.< /Text>

The staff is excellent. The problem is how long they keep you waiting. My appointment was at 9am. Checked in and sat down till they called me. Waited 45 minutes to be called. Got my blood pressure and my temperature taken was taken to another room. Waited for another 45 mins. Finally got to see the doctor.  Less then 10 minutes later I'm being told, OK see you in 6 weeks! Another 20mins waiting to get my appointment scheduled. So almost 2*hrs waiting for a 10 min doctor visit.< /Review>

U.S. Clinic, now CONCENTRA could do a job in delivering service to their patients. But, in any case, I have experienced the worse. I was just ready to see an specialist Doctor. When he, the Doctor, discovered that the medical chart wasn't mine. This was not a simple error. It's illegal to switch patients chart because it violates patient's confidentiality and open it to a different patient's treatment.

The office Manager rarely exercise proper Supervision and the office receptionists lack incredibly training in how to properly and professionally handle patient's request.

The system they have is the poorest I have experienced in years of dealing with Doctors. I guess this speak volumes for Worker Comp and injured cases..!

I gave them two (2) stars as a gratitude, but they have definitely planty room to improve, improve and improve their services to patient's medical needs!<//text>

I went in for a complete physical, TB shot, and drug test and I set there for 20mins and was called back and the staff was so friendly, we laughed and they made sure I was comfortable. The doctor was awesome, he came in with good spirit and vines, he made me laugh and was just great! I went back to days later for my TB reading and was there 15mins at the most. Great place-location Broadway and Gardena in the city of Gardena. 😊</text>

< Review>
Dr Bos and her assistant are great the rest of them are terrible. They make you wait 2 or 3 hours even with an appointment and they have no effective management that I can discern. Each employee is in their own little world. One guy put a full cast on me while I kept telling him that the Doctor said a 1/2 cast, when I finally forced him to ask, when he finished the Dr. at that time said oh well that's OK because she thought I could not hear then she finally made him take it off and redo it. My injury got worse with t here treatment so I ended up needing surgery because they put an unapproved device on me because they "got stuck with them".<//Review>

I’ve had the fish burrito and the chimichanga burrito and they are delicious.  What I really liked was the fish wasn’t fried in batter, just different.
They are also fast and a fun place to go and eat.</text>

Probably the tastiest chicken burrito I've ever had!

Excellent salsa, fresh tasting tortillas, "cinnamony" horchata. Love it!

Definitely worth it if you're in Jamul!</text>

Our family heard that this restaurant is finally under a NEW ownership and we decided to give our local places a chance. Well we were pleasantly surprised to see improvements in the restaurant! The food was really good and the portions were really good too! I really hope that they get the chance to succeed here! We have been really needing a good place to eat here in Jamul!!<//text>

Found this gem!! Their food is delish. Fish tacos were the best I've ever had. My husband had the juevos rancheros and he said it was really tasty. The chips and salsa was good too. Real authentic Mexican food. Very friendly staff. I'd come back again!< /text>

AMAZING!
That's all I have to say about this dealership and the wonderful people that work there, specially Arlene, Julio from finance, Victor and Tony.
Just bought a Mazda yesterday and I couldn't be happier with their excellent service and friendly helpfulness. The team was incredible and helped me get EXACTLY what I wanted. Thank you so much!
I highly recommend this dealership.<//text>

Emailed the dealership about a vehicle I was interested in leasing. Tony sent me extremely fair and reasonable numbers for the lease. Came in and waited a bit but very nice showrooms. Arleene was a very helpful point of contact for all of the details of the lease. Absolutely no pressure to buy or throw me absurd numbers that didn't match up with what was told to me. The numbers sold themselves. Finance guy, Julio was also great! And Siya was amazing in showing me all the features of my car. Like I said, the bear car buying/leasing experience I've had.

I just had an exceptional experience with Victor who reviewed my car features with me.  He made it "easy breezy"--I felt confident knowing I could familiarize myself with all aspects of my Mazda3 preferred model.  He gave me his card & assured me I could contact him if I had questions or concerns!  Thank you Victor!  Thank you Culver City Mazda!!</text>

I was looking for a Mazda 3 hatchback with manual transmission. Every dealership near me kept giving me a markup price or unwanted services and accessories on top of MSRP. Found the car I was looking for at Culver City. I asked them over the phone what the price would be and they gave me the deal that I wanted. When i showed up, I thought they might sneak in some hidden fees or charges but to my surprise they were HONEST and RESPECTFUL to the deal that we had made over the phone. They didn't even try to persuade me into extended warranties or unwanted accessories. Excellent customer service. Will be doing business with these people again. Shoutout to Michael.< /text>

<text>An overall amazing dealership experience that has an unconventional approach to doing business. No herd of sales persons gang tackling you as soon as you open the door. A very classy, relaxed but extremely efficient well organized company. Personally the most impressive I've experienced in over 40 years of automobile purchases and leases. Worth your time to make the drive from any distance. They are committed to customer service and your satisfaction from the Receptionist Ceret who directed me to Kylon. who immediately got the ball rolling with Arlene and Tony in sales. The sales transaction moved forward flawlessly. Everything in order and prepared prior to my arrival. Paperwork, the car,etc. The time in finance was a blur. In and out in minutes compliments of Roman. The walk around was clearly explained and understood thanks to Kervin. No lag between all the steps and no regrets. Thank you to all involved in making my experience a positive and memorable one. Bob L.</text><name>R J Enoel< /name><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba3fb2fca771:0xd229e48cfba4dc28</Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< Response>

They negligently sold me a new tire with a leaky stem valve but don't feel the hassle to fix it warrants a discount, and the coolant sensor no longer works after they replaced the coolant, and they don't respond to text messages for days or even weeks, they will not look up on my account and tell me what brand of struts they put in because now my car bottoms out.

1st day, see tire was low BEFORE leaving lot, reinflated
Two days later, new tire is flat again!
2nd time driving there, they had to keep it overnight!
3rd day driving there, they fix, but refuse giving discount or replacement tire.
They fixed valve for free and gave loaner car, however, I feel a discount is fair for my lost time at work driving there & back over and over due to their mistake. They disagree, and feel fixing the valve & giving a loaner&uber is sufficient. Keep in mind this new leaky tire was part of $6,000 worth of suspension fixes, so I feel they have the profit margins from my account to discount the tire due to hassle & my time off work. Sorry but even though they were nice, I cannot rate the experience well since they do not value my time lost due to their mistake. Its very uncomfortable telling my boss & team I'm taking a large chunk of workday off to keep driving in to a mechanic over and over all week long. Not to mention, my wife was about to drive on a flat tire they sold me, very risky for my wife, child, & myself.

Then when texting with them I needed to reschedule the appt for coolant sensor breaking after they replaced coolant, they ghosted me. Screenshot attached< /Text>

Eric Reyes, my salesperson extraordinaire, was excellent. The space is excellent. The cars are the best bang for the buck, as they're rightfully known for. The Miata is a four-cylinder masterpiece that anyone wanting a Cayman or other German roadster should consider if they also like paying off their mortgage, and are willing to give up brand name cred to keep half their money. Would recommend this location and salesman to any friend or family member searching for any vehicle. Looking forward to making this my go-to dealership.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><review>As reviews state, and as many car dealerships are, they will love you and treat you like their best friend until the sale is complete. After that, it’s like texting a girl who was interested in you when she was drunk but now realizes her mistake.

Dealerships seem to have a superiority complex, like they’re too good to be selling you a car. You guys make less than 150k a year and don’t even treat the customers like you truly care. I’ve had people at BMW treat me with more actual interpersonal care.< /review>< user_name>

<review>With this being my first leasing experience I don't have anything to compare it to but I have and still work in industries where customer service is key. Culver City Mazda and their team are on top of it all! From my initial search on the website, to meeting with the onsite team and eventually driving off the lot, it was virtually a seamless transaction.

Thank you Ceret for your warm welcome and checking to ensure I was being assisted while waiting! Arlene, the reviews don't lie you're amazing! Flo, I appreciate you taking the time to clearly review the terms of my lease with and making sure I understood what I was signing up for! Victor, you are definitely an expert and know how to simply walk-through the features of vehicle before sending the customer off with their new shiny toy!

My only feedback has to do with the appointment scheduling and letting future prospective buyers/lessees know who they may be meeting ahead of time. When I arrived a few minutes before my appointment, it seemed as if it were still being set up on the spot. Not a huge ordeal to me but I can see where some other people may be frustrated.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Resp>

<text>A little bit of a hit and miss with this dealership over the last 4 years. I've been here mostly for service and twice for possible car purchase. My very first experience was mediocre. It started bad then it was good then REALLY bad. They stated parts needed replacing soon but were brand new factory parts replaced at an independent shop that had been done 3 months earlier. Second experience was pretty good - service again. Standard oil change, got a ride home - nice!! First possible car purchase: couldn't find a car in color /options - not their fault but salesman was very nice, professional. Second possible car purchase wasn't pleasant. Looking for a certified used vehicle but salesman didn't seem interested enough.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1608587001135, 'text': 'Hello Willie,\nThanks so much for taking the time to leave us a rating and review.

Aaron Corea was super efficient in helping me get set up with all the paperwork online so that by the time I got to the Mazda dealership, all I had to do was sign the papers. It took less than an hour to get my new car.
He also made sure I knew the basics of my new car and had MyMazda app set up to feel comfortable and start using it right away. Great service all around!</Text>

I have been to this location twice within. The past 2 or so years and received the same advisor that is completely unhelpful.

The first situation Mazda was suppose to fix an issue that a recall was sent out for. After trying to stop by without an appointment when the issue was occurring no one would help me. I was told I had to make an appointment and there were no opening for 2 weeks. Once my appointment date came and I dropped off my car around 8:00am-9:00am they had my car until 5:00pm when they close. There were no follow up calls, when I called to numerous times to follow up the "Advisor" was NEVER available to speak. After just showing up around 5:00pm. I was then told that my car was not worked on at all.

The second situation I took my car for an oil change (with an appointment time for 1:20pm) and decided while I was there to get a diagnostic as well I was told by the "SAME ADVISOR" the diagnostic would be $107.00 even though I could get it cheaper, I agreed due to them having my car. I was first told that it would take 2 hours. Called for update around 4:00pm, my advisor was not available (no surprise there) nor was there a call returned. I had to wait on hold with a nice gentleman for the service department just to see that what was taking so long, after then talking with her a quarter to 5:00pm. She says Yeah, its ready you can come now. (10- points taken from Mazda) I arrived at Mazda and car was not finished nor ready. I finally got my car at 5:35pm and missed an important appointment.

Best part of the whole situation was that the diagnostic was actually $175.00 not $107.00.🙃 From now on I will be going out of my way and go to the location in DTLA or even the Valley at this point. Worst service and and customer service I have gotten at the Culver City location.</text>

<Review>Great service.

I work nights and when I brought the car in for a service today, they suggested I could leave the car and come pick it up after I've slept rather than wait in the dealership. They had it waiting for me when I got back, washed and even vacuumed inside! They had a great discount ($35 off of the service)  and offer free lyft pick up/drop off.

Very happy with my experience</Review>< pictures>

<review>I wanted to share my exceptional experience working with Carl H, the manager of the service department at Culver City Mazda.

I bought my CX-5 new at the dealership about 3.5 months ago. About a week ago, I took it in to a hand car wash in the city. Something either with the temperature of the water or the solutions they used to clean the car caused scratches all over the hood of the car during drying, a couple were even down to the metal.

Pretty upset about what had happened, I took my car into the dealership and explained how the scratches appeared and that it was only 3 months old. Carl and his crew worked magic on the hood of my car, removing all the scratches including the two that were down to the metal. Cannot speak highly enough about how much of a pleasure it was to work with Carl and his team. Highly recommend purchasing from this dealership due to the incredible service provided to their customers.

Thank you, Carl and team!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1605832271668, 'text': "Hello Chris,\nWe appreciate your kind words for Carl, and for your feedback!

Don’t buy your car here! They provide great customer service until your check clears, then they treat you worse than garbage. Both the service center and sales team are terrible. When I bought my car, they lost the key and had me wait for over 6 hours before they told me the key was lost. I didn’t get my car until the next day. The sales contract included free first oil change, when I brought my car in they charged me and told me they never give away oil changes - even after I showed them it was clearly listed in the contract. The software on my car was recalled, I brought the car in for an update- they told me they would only update the software if I paid $1,200 to fix the “spider webbing” on the screen - which is also a known defect on from Mazda and the dealership.</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Leasing our Mazda
was a decent experience. But unfortunately at the end of our lease term we found out that the dealership FORGED our initials to increase residual value. Finance had a second lease agreement that had our forged initials. The only reason I found out is because I asked a ton of questions when the buyout numbers were off, and they sent us the second document. The initials were not even close to ours (mine were even the wrong letters). After hours on the phone with finance, they finally said they would open an investigation but we are going through a lawyer to get this resolved.

Lastly, when googling this, apparently it’s a common thing at car dealerships, so check your paperwork at lease end!< /review>< pics>

I always enjoy bringing my car here. You will have to wait before they first get to you (even with an appointment so be prepared for that) but once they do, everything goes pretty quickly from there. They provide a free lyft ride (5 or 8 mile radius I believe) both ways while they service your car expeditiously. The work is always top notch and the service is done with a smile. I continually feel well taken care of when I come here.<//review>

Alex was awesome! We had to return our Scion xD at end of lease and we wanted a RAV4. He had us in and out with a brand new lease within 2 hours. Great service, excellent digital signing features.

Mazda Roadside Assistance had to set me up with 2 different towing companies because CULVER CITY Mazda refused the Towing Company services...what kind of BS is that?? How do you refuse to accept a Mazda vehicle at YOUR Mazda dealership. I thought Mazda was an umbrella of Other Mazda team members...clearly their lack of being a team player is showing. Never ever coming back here.</Review>

< Review>
I got a VERY good deal on culver city Mazda: thanks to David (sales) and Benny (manager).  They are both very nice and helped me to keep within my budget and get EXTRA stuff on my car!

The finance guy (sorry, dont know his name) was also super helpful and several good tips for me.  My new (used 2016 Grand Touring) have some scratches so they sent it to the body shop for repairs.  In the meantime, they loaned me a NEW 2019 CX-5 Grand Touring... OMG, I LOVE this car, its better than the used car I purchased.

After a week in the body shop, my baby looks just like NEW car... SUPER happy about it.

Just want to share my happy experience and GREAT deal on Culver City Mazda, they have Wonderful term here, everyone super helpful. I been many dealer and few Mazda dealer;, only Culver city Mazda are truly helpful and very straight forward, and they did not waste my time.

Car shopping is pain on your brain, body and its kills the time you can do something that is a lot of fun.
Was in car shopping online for 3 weekdays and 3 weekends, visit those " Good " deal online on real dealer,

I was looking for Rav4, CRV and CX5, Rav4 mpg is lower and price is higher than other 2, CRV is nice but interior material is ok, after drove CX-5, LOVE it!  MPG is same with CRV, but interior material is way better than CRV, and if you to " SPEED UP" ( very smooth speed up on Fwy and climb), CX-5 Grand Touring will be your best option, so FUN to drive and roomy.</Review>

<Review>This is my second lease at Culver City Mazda. Erick Reyes assisted me when I walked in. He was very friendly and helped me with my first lease. He answered all my questions and was very knowledgeable about all the cars that I was interested in. He truly is a fantastic sales associate and an asset to this store.

I decided to go with a newer model of the CX-5 and was impressed with all the new features and of course the Price! I am a very happy customer who will continue to lease my new vehicles with this fine establishment. They are always on point and come through with all the requests that I have asked about over the years. They go over and above with their service and support. I also would like to thank Leigh Balcher for being of assistance as well. He has an amazing personality, friendly, funny and full of knowledge.

Thanks Again Culver City Mazda! See you again in a few years!

Really shady dealership. There were scratches all over the side window and gauge cluster on our new car (didn't notice in the bright sun) and I am still waiting on a soft copy of the paperwork I signed. I've left voicemails and emails over the course of three weeks but the relevant individuals have been impossible to reach. Stay far away.<//Review>

I purchased my car in the beginning of June, and it took almost 6 months to receive my license plates. In addition to that, I cancelled my GAP coverage in June and did not receive my refund until over 5 months later. For being a "highly rated" car dealership, this was absolutely the worst sales experience I have ever had. Tony, Richard, Rosie, and Roman were the individuals involved in my purchase. At one point, the dealership stopped responding to any important questions I had about either my EXPIRED temporary plates or my absence of a GAP refund check. It wasn't until I involved Mazda Customer Service that they decided to do something. Even then, they disregarded several of my emails and requests. I am not the type of person to write negative reviews, but the amount of neglect that has happened from this dealership regarding my situation is unacceptable. It should not take 6 months to receive plates, nor should it take 6 months to send a check. After all this, nobody once apologized to me for the trouble and inconvenience that they caused. Mazda Culver City has lost a customer, and I would never recommend this dealership to anyone. I would rate them 0 stars if I could.<//text>

<review>This is my second lease at Culver City Mazda. Erick Reyes assisted me when I walked in. He was very friendly and helped me with my first lease. He answered all my questions and was very knowledgeable about all the cars that I was interested in. He truly is a fantastic sales associate and an asset to this store.

I decided to go with a newer model of the CX-5 and was impressed with all the new features and of course the Price! I am a very happy customer who will continue to lease my new vehicles with this fine establishment. They are always on point and come through with all the requests that I have asked about over the years. They go over and above with their service and support. I also would like to thank Leigh Balcher for being of assistance as well. He has an amazing personality, friendly, funny and full of knowledge.

Thanks Again Culver City Mazda! See you again in a few years!

<Text>I purchased my car in the beginning of June, and it took almost 6 months to receive my license plates. In addition to that, I cancelled my GAP coverage in June and did not receive my refund until over 5 months later. For being a "highly rated" car dealership, this was absolutely the worst sales experience I have ever had. Tony, Richard, Rosie, and Roman were the individuals involved in my purchase. At one point, the dealership stopped responding to any important questions I had about either my EXPIRED temporary plates or my absence of a GAP refund check. It wasn't until I involved Mazda Customer Service that they decided to do something. Even then, they disregarded several of my emails and requests. I am not the type of person to write negative reviews, but the amount of neglect that has happened from this dealership regarding my situation is unacceptable. It should not take 6 months to receive plates, nor should it take 6 months to send a check. After all this, nobody once apologized to me for the trouble and inconvenience that they caused. Mazda Culver City has lost a customer, and I would never recommend this dealership to anyone. I would rate them 0 stars if I could.<//Text>< pics>

I was in much need of a car. I wasn’t really sure what I expected to leave with or if I would leave with anything. Thanks to Max I was able to find something I completely love. Driving my new car seems unreal, and I love that it’s red. The whole process was straight to the point. Quick and painless. I left grateful and very happy with the experience and customer service I received.<//Review>

I drive over there in time for the test drive and I am told there is no available parking in the lot. So I call the sales rep I was meeting, Tony and get sent to voicemail. The voicemail box is full. I then send an email with no response. Maybe if you helped future customers the parking lot full of cars being sold wouldn't be so full, just a thought.

Christian was extremely helpful and made the process painless and enjoyable. He was super easy to work with. We talked, we laughed and then we made a great deal.

He was very knowledgeable about the car and answered all of my questions.
He also went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my lease and helped me to keep within my budget. I couldn’t be happier with the whole process.

I got a follow-up email the day after I leased my car and really feel they are sincerely committed to making sure I have the best experience possible and that we cultivate a long lasting relationship.

Thank you Christian and all the wonderful people at Culver City Mazda!<//Review>< pictures>

HIGHLY recommend this dealership!! I came to them after having an awful experience at the Santa Monica dealership.  Michael helped me out right away--was SUPER trustworthy and helpful especially after explaining my experience to him.  Its hard to find car salesmen you trust but I felt so at ease and taken care of here, and got a great deal on my awesome new CX-5! :)<//Review>

I took my 2015 Miata to Culver City Mazda. I had bought it and had issues with my transmission and I was super upset. George Mejia was my rep for the service. He was a good man even after dealing with my mood for being ripped off. He got them warranty company to install a new transmission after two failed attempts.

I left and it is doing great so far and nothing is missing like the reviews I have read.

Thanks,

Robert< /Text>

While I was looking for a new SUV, after the online research left a voice message to this dealership, and got a call back from Tony Tehrani, I couldn't  believe that was able to close the deal in just five minutes over the phone with Tony where he was very aggressive with the quote. Drove to the dealer day after to pick the vehicle up and the customer service was awesome, worked with Rosie in Sales and Julio in Finance and overall my buying experience was excellent and would recommend this dealer ship for new cars</Review>

< Review>
Very reputable dealership. I have leased a Mazda CX-5 three times in a row. Today is the first time I worked with Mazda Culver City, and it was a superior experience. I felt that I was being dealt with fairly and honestly throughout the negotiations and got what I know is a terrific deal. When I have had my Mazda serviced here, I love that they wash my car, even if it is only for a recall fix, and send me home and bring me back via Uber.< /Review>

Great customer service. I was in and out in less than an hour for the recall on my car. Tells me that they stand behind their car to make sure my car is good.</Text>

I am very satisfied with my experience at Culver City Mazda. I just leased a 2016 Mazda 3 and I absolutely love it! The sales team was very friendly and super helpful. I am a first time buyer and was really nervous and apprehensive about this experience. Most of the dealers I went to, though helpful, were obviously just trying to sell me whatever car they could. I got the impression that the team at Mazda had my best interest in mind. Bill was my salesman and from the start was very helpful in finding the perfect car for me. He also took a lot of time explaining all of the features of the car with me and assured me that I could contact him at any time with any questions I had. Benny took a lot of time going through the leasing process with me and answered all of my questions thoroughly. Will was also thorough in explaining all the paperwork, which I truly appreciated.  I also received a lot of input and advice from Max who was in the office during my time at the dealership. Overall, I was very well taken care of and in the end felt like I was making the best decision. Though I don't live in close proximity to this dealer, I know that I will definitely still service my car here because of the positive experience I had.< /review>

Everyone here is great! This is the second Mazda I've leased @ CC and the team is awesome!! Roman is awesome to work with, he knows exactly what I was looking for, eliminated much of the back-and-forth you get with typical dealerships, and we quickly made a deal! Will and Benny were also great and took super great care of me! Thank you team for another awesome Mazda experience! LC</Text>

Class acts all around. My fiance and I came in to test drive a CX-5, I have been eyeing one for awhile. We had the pleasure of meeting David Castro who made the test drive process and our whole experience at the dealership FUN, RELAXED and positive. My lease was up on a sedan and I wanted to test drive a few more Mid Size SUV's to really get a feel for what I liked so we proceeded to a few more dealerships. Hands down, NO OTHER MID SIZE SUV compared to the Mazda CX-5 and no other dealership could replicate the warm, friendly, welcoming rapport David had established with us. It was a no brainer for us to return to Culver City Mazda and work on the deal. That's where David's manager Benny came in with full transparency and professionalism. Suffice to say, I have a new Mazda CX-5 now and I am 150% happy with the decision. David and Benny are professional, stand up and eager to work with YOU to get you into a new car! I can't recommend Culver City Mazda and David Castro especially enough.</review>

I’m from of town and needed my car serviced for my next long drive. So I chose
to stop by here. I would shop around for prices for service before heading here. Got simple service done here(oil change, filters replaced). I noticed it was a bit pricey. Called my dealership back home and also called a few places in town their prices for the same service were $70-$90 less than what I paid here. I was in a rush and needed it done. I should’ve priced checked before hand. They’re nice and offered a relaxed waiting area.<//Review>

Called on memorial day to see if they were still operating in normal business hours. The woman who answered had a very unprofessional tone and told me, “I don’t know, I hope so.” I said I would call back later then, and she asked why I would do that, and added, “are you gonna make an appointment, or...” Obviously I can’t make an appointment if I don’t know their business hours. Clearly I am not the only person who’s had bad experience with this receptionist. This is my only interaction with them; I decided to take my Mazda to Santa Monica instead.< /review>

I called three days in advance and spoke with a salesperson about the car I wanted to test drive. I was specific about the model and trim, Mazda 3 premium trim. I called the morning of my appt and reemphasized the car I wanted to drive, premium trim sedan, and confirmed timing. The timing of my appt shifted (no big deal) and I had to remind my salesperson that I wanted the sedan and not the hatch, also that I was traveling there specifically to drive the car and was on a tight schedule.

I arrived to the wrong car. It was the hatch premium trim, he tried to keep me there my saying the preferred had the same engine etc... and wanted me to drive it but he lost me. Would have bought right there if he had the car. Now Culver City has lost my business forever. Awful client service.<//text>< pictures>

I turned in a leased car before the lease was over...leased the same car but a newer model. No one mentioned a word about mileage. About 3 months later I got a call from corporate saying I owe $400 for going over my mileage from my previously leased car. Really bad to not say anything at the time. Corporate said they wouldn’t know but that is complete BS. If you turn in a car and lease a new car they could very easily ask what your lease allowed for mileage and tell you that you would owe if you went over!! Pretty basic. I didn’t think I would need to pay since I rolled over into a new car. If I had known I very liked would not have leased another Mazda, which I now probably won’t the next time my lease is over.

And yeah, service can be spotty. The first time I had my serviced there it was horrible. They had my car for the entire day because someone dropped the ball.<//Text>

Superb customer service - they provided a ride from and to their location to my office (they will drop you off anywhere within an 8 mi radius) and in addition to the regular oil change/tire rotation service, they also cleaned the car interior and gave the outside a wash. Everyone I interacted with was very courteous and professional, and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a Mazda dealership/service location.<//review>

These guys provided an amazing experience from the start of my new car search in January 2015 to the end of the hunt in June! Richard and Rosie were my initial points-of-contact; they provided a warm, welcoming experience and Richard was very patient as I moved from total indecision to well-researched shopper to satisfied lessee when he and Tony helped me settle on a brand new Mazda3. I absolutely love the car, but what makes it even more satisfying is the relationship that I've built with Culver City Mazda.

During my lengthy search I visited over 20 different dealerships in the LA area looking for the perfect car and every other place tried to hustle and pressure me into making a snap decision so they could get a quick sale. From the start, I could tell that Culver City Mazda was different. They operate at the highest level of integrity, which is why I came back there once I decided that a Mazda3 was the model that would best suit my lifestyle.

Everyone at this dealership was a joy to work with, from the receptionists on the phone to Will, the financing manager, to Richard and Tony. They know a lot about cars but they treated me with respect and never went "over my head" with car speak.

As we were hashing out the specifics of the lease, Tony and Will conducted themselves in a relaxed, confident and dignified demeanor; they answered all my questions plainly and didn't give me a run around, which is what I got pretty much everywhere else.

What made it even more attractive was the general workplace atmosphere. In the midst of an unimaginably hectic Saturday, with a lobby full of patrons and support technicians flying around, Tony Tehrani was the picture of calm, handling requests and treating everyone (co-workers, subordinates and potential customers) with the kind of respect we normally reserve for C-level executives.

I could go on and on and on about this place's excellence, but really you should go see for yourself. Truly EXCEPTIONAL!<//Text>

<Review>I purchased a vehicle here. It has turned out to be a good car for a fairly decent price. However, the product is not what I have issue with - the sales & service staff is why I am giving 2 stars. There was too much unnecessary deception & stress resulting from it.
Examples: 1) finding a vehicle (after the ones seen on their site were not there), test driving, deciding I like it, making an offer - then being told that the price given to me initially had been a 'mistake'...
2)then having to deal with the "certified pre-owned" certification not actually being completed up to Mazda standards,
3) bringing it back to the dealership and being lied to again,
4) having to call Mazda Corporate and get them involved
5) then take the vehicle to another dealership to have them confirm that several key points of the certification had not been done such as resetting the engine computer (which directly affects engine performance), broken wipers not fixed, very worn tires not being replaced...
And every time you call this place you end up getting transferred around to way way way too many people - all while being given excuses & very little help.  Since I purchased the car, I have met several people who had similar experiences wit this dealership.
Thankfully Mazda makes good vehicles and I have not had any problems with the actual car itself - only the shady antics of the sales & service teams at Culver City Mazda. They pretend, and even try in some instances, to be helpful - but frequently do not follow through, giving excuse after excuse why they cant help. It is stressful, deceptive and totally unnecessary.<//Review>< pictures>

Great experience. . I consider myself a pro when it comes to car shopping as I've been to plenty of dealerships recently, and let me tell you "this changed my whole outlook on car shopping as it was such a pleasant and quick process". This place is the best, hands down!! Trust me, you want to contact them when your in the market for a car because after all, you've got nothing to lose but EVERYTHING TO GAIN!!

They don't play games like the others, they shoot straight and you don't have to be a mathematician for the  numbers to make sense.

Just bought my Wife a car from there about 10 days ago, and I'll be back shortly for mine.< /review>

Amazing service, quick and even got a car wash until other manufacture dealers.

Update: Came over President's day weekend got the deal that I wanted for my mother now she is happy with her M3 touring. Great service as always. Too bad I didn't get any fun gift mail like I did when I got my M2 back in 2014 from Galvin Mazda.< /text>

I put my car in Mazda Culver city service. They tell me to fix many parts to make car run well and it cost me 2,200$. After they fix parts, and they tell me should replace whole engine cost $8,000. So what the meaning of $2,200?. I recommend you not go here for service or buy new car. I want to tell them : " to be honest with others".< /text>

Staff was great and very friendly. I didn't feel pressured at all. Only downside was that due to the small size of this place they have one model of each of their models (usually fully loaded). If you want to see more they take you to their lot 10 minutes away. I would definitely recommend this place!</review>

<review>My experience here buying a new Mazda 6 was fantastic. From the test drive to the financing, every part of the process was smooth and easy. Max, the salesperson who helped me, was friendly, informative, and very patient! I have had some extremely frustrating experiences with car dealerships in the past (you can see my review of Browning Mazda in Cerritos), but this was the exact opposite! And most importantly, I love my new car and feel great about the process at Culver City Mazda. If you are thinking about a Mazda, I would highly recommend checking out this dealership and ask for Max!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1476229583633, 'text': "Hello Todd, thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review.

The best leasing experience ever. This dealership is interested in working with your budget and options, opened about prices, Richard was willing to make all agreements over the phone, and the dealership did it's best to get me into a new car. In fact, it took less than 1 hour from the moment I stepped on the lot to leaving it in CX-5.
You will be treated as a valued customer because everyone cares about your shopping experience. After the purchase, Culver City Mazda follows up with you to make sure you're happy with your car and to provide any support needed. Culver City Mazda is an example of what the auto dealership should be.
Huge appreciation to the team that worked on my car: Richard, Tony, Maria, and Rosie. Contact anyone and you'll get the best customer care.</Text>

< Review>
I purchased a new Mazda CX-5 from another dealer a few weeks ago, and yesterday noticed a clicking sound from one of the tires. When I inspected it, there was a nail puncturing the tire. I brought in my car to Culver City Mazda since it's actually the closest dealer to where I live.

They couldn't find a record of the pricey service plan that should cover this repair (I have to call the original dealer about this), but Ken in the service department offered to inspect it to see if it's something repairable.

Turns out it just needed a little plug, an $18 service. Since I recently purchased the car, he provided the service for free, and even threw in a car wash!  Remember that I purchased this car at a different dealer.

It was really a great experience, and if the purpose was to bring me back the next time I need service, it definitely worked. Everyone was very courteous and professional.  I brought it in early on a weekday morning and all in all it took about an hour which I felt was reasonable.

5 stars!</Review>

What a great car buying experience. Max was my salesman who put me in a sleek, black 2016 Mazda 6. Benny was also a great floor manager. 10 times out of 10 I would recommend this place.<//review>

<review>My first visit to the service department at Culver City Mazda can be described as wonderful and pain-free. Ken Ferguson greeted me with a great smile and was able to service all of my car needs in a timely manner.
My car was returned clean and in perfect condition.
The popcorn was fresh and the rest of the personnel at the dealership were very professional and I had a pleasant experience overall.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1438882168341, 'text': "Hello Vazken, thank you very much for taking the time to write us a review.

Good sales guy - Bill. Easy to deal with. Knew his stuff (and basketball history).
Even the finance woman Donna was very helpful. She suggested a payment option I didn't even think of.
I could have gotten the CR-V for a little less,  but I went with the CX-5 and I like my choice< /Text>

<Review>I needed an oil change. I drop my car off under that premise. A couple hours later Lance calls me an says I need "induction system service". I ask him how much that will be, he tells me the price and says "so we'll get that done and call you back." And hangs up. I think it sounds odd, but think "if I need it..." I get back to the shop and ask him what the extra thing was. Lance explains it, and I leave. Still feeling odd, I Google it, and it turns out they worked me for an extra $200. Completely unnecessary. I later notice on the receipt it says "Customer requests perform complete induction system service." Wow. No I didn't. Culver City Mazda stole $200 from me. They never asked, "Do you want this done?" Or gave me other options, just "We're doing this, we'll call you in 45 minutes." Click.

<text>My experience with Culver City Mazda has been very positive, starting from the time you arrive for your appointment till you leave. You are greeted upon arrival, and told how long (5-10 minutes) your wait will be till a service advisor checks your car in. After check-in, it is very pleasant to sit in their waiting area, have excellent coffee (and/or donuts), and read the newspaper, or browse the Internet on your phone or laptop. Culver City Mazda is moving to a new customer management software, so I was greeted by an advisor with everything on their iPad. I didn't have to wait at the service desk like I did before. Nice to see.

When the servicing was complete, someone came and found me (rather than announce on the PA), to let me know that the car was ready. Plus my car got a complimentary car wash!! Also a nice touch.

Overall, a pleasant experience. Happy to be a Mazda customer.</text>< gmapID>

This dealership is interested in working with your budget and options, opened about prices, Richard was willing to make all agreements over the phone, and the dealership did it's best to get me into a new car.

You will be treated as a valued customer because everyone cares about your shopping experience. After the purchase, Culver City Mazda follows up with you to make sure you're happy with your car and to provide any support needed. Culver City Mazda is an example of what the auto dealership should be.

I visited this location a few days ago . I was a first time buyer. I moved out here from Florida . Thinking I was going to get the car I've been wanting. First I want to say you guys need more sales people I waited for about 10 mins then I walked out . And secondly I want to say the Mazda receptionist (older woman age range mid 40s ) was on her phone and ignoring the calls that were coming in. Im glad i did a walk in and not a phone call. I did not even get greeted when i walked in. If you hire people to sit in the front desk for them to be on there phones you guys may want to double check resumes.< /Review>

<text>I purchased my car there because of the welcoming smiles of Tony Tehrani, Richard Diaz and Rosie Milad. From that day the attention, professionalism that these individuals bring would make anyone want to buy a car and get it serviced there. In the service department Steven Ruiz .has assisted me with a welcoming smile and a how can we help you attitude. When I have purchased parts Manny Reyes also welcomes you with a smile. .Jeremy Moreno is always there to make sure that if you need anything he will take care of it. I met Rolly Ramos years ago when I needed the back glass replaced and ever since then when I am getting the car serviced or picking up a part he has always greeted me with a smile and the same attitude of how can we help. I must say that Sal Gonzalez is extremely fortunate to have these individuals working and representing Culver City Mazda & Volvo.  They ROCK!</text>< Pictures>

Having never purchased a new car from a dealership before (previous cars were always used and purchased directly from the previous owners), I was nervous; I had always heard about how hellish the experience could be with high pressure tactics and time consuming meetings in windowless rooms. Thankfully, this dealership bucks the trend; my experience was fantastic, and everyone that I dealt with was awesome. While I was made aware of some possible add-ons and price points, I did not at all feel pressured to add any of those extra bells and whistles. The financing meeting was swift, and everything was presented in a way that was very easy to understand. It was a very pleasant experience all around, and I would indeed recommend the dealership to anyone looking for a new car.< /Text>

Today I spoke with Siya - Sales person in phone call, requested for test drive appointment, he said yes available, since I stay nearby was there in 30mins. Once I visit enquired about my visa which is fine and finally gave another appointment for test drive which he could have done it on phone call also he was not interested in giving any details. Highly disappointed.</Review>

I can’t say how incredibly pleased I am with this dealership. From the cleanliness to the attentiveness to the care, you are top notch. Above and beyond!

As if the Lyft service wasn’t enough, your team took care of annoying tree sap that had been on my car for a couple of weeks that I had no idea how to remove...Without me asking!

I mean, come on.
Is this a Maserati dealership or what?

Thank you for always treating me with such class, such professionalism.
I’ve been a longtime waitress by day so I know what’s behind what you do. And it’s exquisite!

Thanks guys. I hope you all prosper greatly!

(p.s. I’m not sure who my service people have been the past two visits, but please check your records, as they are included in this too. Tony is the person I originally worked with for my lease. and he’s wonderful - the reason I’ll be returning at lease end. But i want to make sure that everyone who’s served me is given credit, including the sweet receptionist with the fro :) )< /Text>

<Review>My experience with Culver City Mazda has been very positive, starting from the time you arrive for your appointment till you leave. You are greeted upon arrival, and told how long (5-10 minutes) your wait will be till a service advisor checks your car in. After check-in, it is very pleasant to sit in their waiting area, have excellent coffee (and/or donuts), and read the newspaper, or browse the Internet on your phone or laptop. Culver City Mazda is moving to a new customer management software, so I was greeted by an advisor with everything on their iPad. I didn't have to wait at the service desk like I did before. Nice to see.

When the servicing was complete, someone came and found me (rather than announce on the PA), to let me know that the car was ready. Plus my car got a complimentary car wash!! Also a nice touch.

Overall, a pleasant experience. Happy to be a Mazda customer.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1481827185109, 'text': "Hello Sanjay, thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review.

Took my car to be serviced at Culver City Mazda, and won’t be bringing it back again.

My experience left a lot to be desired; starting with the Lyft they insisted I use not showing (had to call my own to get back to work), continuing into 2 calls where they requested approval to do $2,600 of service (and getting laughter from every 3rd party I checked that price and assessment of services with after), and ending up with them trying to give me back my car with the key literally broken off in the ignition after I declined the last round of services.

After having to invest extra time auditing the work done and finding new service partners, it’s not over: I’m still getting requests for surveys every few days despite continuously declining... so here it is.</Review>

after comparing prices at many Mazda dealerships in the area, Culver City Mazda gave me the best deal. When I when in to check the car out, it was everything they promised. This made the whole transaction seamless and as streamlined as possible.

Overall I got exactly what I wanted.<//review>

<Review>It's a common thing to dread buying a car, and dealing with the 'car salesman' stereotype.  I can happily say that of the various dealers I went to, only one bordered on that, and even there was an OK experience.

But I have to say the my experience with Culver City Mazda was heads above the rest, and a stellar experience.  Working with Dan on two different days (I'm a deliberative buyer), and late into the evening on Wednesday to sell me my new Mazda3.  He was helpful, friendly, listened to my needs, and really made me feel he was working to get me in the right car for me ... not just the right car for the bottom line.  And after making a great deal,  Will was fantastic.  Made the paperwork process easy, I would say as fast-as-it-can-be, and both just all around great guys to work with.

Highly recommend.  Will absolutely go back.< /Review><user_name>Christopher Karbo</user_name>< GmapID>

VERY MISLEADING. I had a great experience at this Mazda with sales associate Ray and his manager. They met my needs we found a middle ground on price and I liked the CX5 more than the VW Tiguan I was 1 minute away from getting until I fell upon Mazda right before I went to VW to finalize my lease. The one thing that held me back and was the deciding factor was Carplay. They told me Carplay was coming for my model and I only had to wait until; December and it would be available. Then it was pushed to March. Then in March they told me my model was not included with the free upgrade for Carplay and I would need to pay $400+ to install it. It feels like false advertising and like I was lied to in order to finalize the deal. I've now not had Carplay for 9 months and they will not install it unless I pay another $400+ - VERY SHADY. I was told by Ray and his manager that unfortunately they could only give me a 10% discount. Make sure you're not getting mislead when you finalize your lease.< /Text>

POOR costumer service in the service department. George in service is rude and talks down to customers, especially women. He is chauvinistic and needs to be properly trained. My interactions with him today were disturbing. It is too bad that loyal customers have to be treated so poorly by a horrible person that is supposedly a customer service representative. He reflects poorly on this dealership and the Mazda corporation. He should NEVER tell someone thy are "crazy" and they "dont know what they are talking about" This is unacceptable and inappropriate behavior for an employee...regardless of the situation. Shame on You Culver City Mazda for employing such a rude miserable person.</review>

Dan, Will, and Charlie were unbelievably helpful when it came to putting me into my new CX-5! I went to the other dealerships in the area, and Culver City Mazda was by far the nicest, no haggling, straight forward dealership I went to. Their main goal is to put you in a car that you feel good about at a price you can afford. Hats off to these guys.<//Review>

<Review>I had an estimate for work done (replacing an air bag sensor) at Culver City Mazda, and in addition to what I asked for, they told me my car needed new brakes (It doesn't, the pads and rotors on all four corners aren't even half-way through their life span). They also told me that my upper motor mount needed to be replaced. I had another Mazda dealer look at the motor mount and they said it was fine.
I know independent repair shops often get a bad reputation for prescribing unnecessary and costly service to customers, but I wouldn't have expected it from a Mazda dealer. I'm a big Mazda fan, but will not be giving Culver City Mazda any more business.<//Review>< username>

This was one of the best car buying experiences I have had in 2 decades. It was pleasant and stress free from start to finish. The entire team worked together to ensure I received the kind of car I wanted with manageable payments. My car salesman, Michael Khashayar was "Awesome." He definitely knows his cars, and without his expertise I would still be looking for a car today. I absolutely love my 2016 CX 5 Grand Touring!!!!
Thanks Culver City Mazda ; )< /review>

My only issue was that since my gas gauge had become clogged, they had recommended not using the lowest grade gas (which Mazda3's are able to use). So it is less of an issue with the service department and more with the company in general. But overall, I'd highly recommend getting your car serviced there.< /Review>

<Text>Please, if you are to offer your customers free pick-up services, can you make sure you actually tell your drivers?!?! No one likes wasting 2hrs of their lives waiting for some unreliable receptionist and driver to show up. Management, please ask Victoria and your receptionist what happened today and see if you can improve communication flow among your staff before offering your drop off/ pick up services? TWO HOURS of my life I will never get back. Honestly, unacceptable.< /Text>< pictures>

I went to get my car checked for a general check up, and the problem was fixed but the salesperson I spoke with tried to upsell me and said my ‘shocks were leaking’ and that my ‘serpentine belt was cracked.’ I didn’t believe it and didn’t get those things replaced (it would’ve been an extra $700) and a month later I had it rechecked at a different Mazda dealership and they said nothing was wrong, without even having me tell them about the shocks and belt. Don’t let them upsell you, otherwise they fix stuff fine.< /Text>

I have been extremely happy from the time I bought my Mazda
at this Dealership ( Culver City) - the best salesmen (Michael Chaya)
to the service departments personnel.
What I appreciate most was that the car not only was ready when promised
but a little sooner then promised and they washed the car.

DO NOT GO HERE!!!

Buying a car? Service? Lease? No, no, no! They will rip you off!

This is by far the worst Mazda dealership.

I have been a loyal Mazda owner and am baffled by the service. Sales, finance, and service made this the worst experience that I have had at a dealership.

The sales team was unclear and added fees/upcharges to every route that we tried to take. When I questioned the fees, I was treated poorly and found out that they were just trying to nickel and dime each part of the transaction. They tried selling gap insurance when we were even on payments (no need for gap)! When we questioned the gap, we were once again treated like idiots and found out that we were correct the entire time. Do not buy new, used, or a lease from this dealership!

The finance team will not keep their word and will try to up-charge you. The interest rate is much higher than market average so do not finance through this dealership! To drop interest rate, they will try to sell warranty or maintenance packages. The maintenance package comes out to overpriced oil changes! Warranty does not cover any major repairs.. not worth it.

The service team will not keep you informed of the status of your car. They will also try to up-sell you poor quality service. I would suggest a different Mazda dealership for this. The other two dealerships that checked the car said everything looked fine, but this location tried upselling multiple parts that “needed to be replaced.”

DO NOT GO HERE! I would suggest any other dealer in the area.

I am very unimpressed.<//text>

<time>1542588083604</time><Rating>1</Rating><review>While shopping for a Mazda CX-5, someone in the business recommended that I meet with Tony, the fleet manager at the Culver City Mazda location. When I made an appointment to meet with him, he blew me off and had me work with one of his associates, which was fine because I know they’re busy. I met with Rosie, who truly created a great experience. She was professional, knowledgeable, and nice to work with. After two test drives, I was ready to buy the car. I found a better deal at a different location, but because Rosie had put time and effort into the sale, I gave her an opportunity to earn the commission by countering the deal. She said she could beat the price by $300 and threw in a due bill for Apple CarPlay and some curtesy rubber mats. After inspecting the car, which was excellently detailed, I was ready to pull the trigger and sign some paperwork. I met with Richard, the Finance Manager of F&I. Initially, I found him to also be professional and courteous, but he quickly revealed himself as a misogynist who attempted to take advantage of me as a woman and first time car buyer. He quoted me at 6% interest rate, which you know is absurd if you’re familiar with how financing works. I was putting down more than half of the car’s worth and have a fairly decent credit score (680 with trans union and 733 with Equifax). He repeatedly called me “sweetie” and told me that there was nothing he could do to reduce the interest rate and that only the bank can do that, which was clearly untrue. After telling him that I was leaving, he left to “get approval” from the fleet manager to lower my interest rate. I thought only the banks could do that? He then gave me an interest rate just under 4%. When I told him that was still ridiculous and I was leaving, he said “sweetie, you just don’t understand how all of this works.” They clearly were not going to give me a reasonable interest rate, so I asked about leasing instead because I know that Mazda has a 0% interest rate for leasing. Tony and Richard gave me the worst quote I’ve ever heard of in my life. Putting $6,000 down to pay $300 a month for a MAZDA is absurd. They very obviously did not want my business, so I left. The only thing I feel bad about is the work that Rosie put in. Yesterday I found the same car for the same price at Galpin Mazda. They offered me a 2.4% interest rate and I gave my business to them instead. Claudia Campos was my salesperson and she was phenomenal, as was the finance manager Paris. It was a smooth process and I drove off the lot last night.

TLDR: Do not buy your car from Culver City. Go to Galpin Mazda instead. The Fleet Manager, Tony, at Culver City was rude and the Financial Manager, Richard was the most misogynistic person I’ve ever dealt with professionally. They will take advantage of you if you’re a woman and they think you don’t know what you’re doing. I do not recommend giving them your business.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1546464506154, 'text': 'Your comments are currently under review by our managerial staff.

Absolutely the worst car buying experience I’ve ever had.  I showed up with a list of six cars. They said to look at the cars I would have to go to a lot 15 minutes away. At the lot none of the cars were washed so it was difficult to discern if the cars were scratched.  Then we learned he had only brought keys for two out of the six cars. The first car didn’t have any gas. So we could only drive it around the block. The next car didn’t even start. Apparently the battery was dead. So he tried to jumpstart it and it still wouldn’t start. We had to wait another 20 minutes for somebody to bring out another key though they were only bring one more key. The next car they tried to start also had a dead battery.  Then we made the salesmen drive us back to the office.  Where were were told we would see a manager.  After waiting another 15 minutes alone, we started to leave- passing 3 mangers sitting in offices alone playing on their cellphones.  It wasn’t until we were in our car about to drive away that the manager showed up.  Please save yourself the trouble and do not shop here. At no point was anyone apologetic for our miserable experiences.< /Review>

I recently purchased a CX-5 from my hometown of Culver City and I was treated well by the sales department as well as the finance department.  I truly recommend Mazda of Culver City for any purchase of Mazda car or suv.   What I like the best is that Christian, who was the sales person, never pushed or needled me to death while I was making a very expensive decision.  I appreciate that a lot!!</Review>

This Mazda dealership treats all of their customers like family! They provide shuttle services and help you out in whatever way they can. So grateful for the service they provided on my car. They were done with my service extremely quickly and they even washed my baby which made my day!<//Review>

Obsessed with financing and leasing, which is understandable. Don't care to waste their time that is considered as "not worth" their time. Pretended to be respectful but fake.

After we came to the conclusion that I can't do finance/lease due to my visa status (which is understandable), I called in to get a quote for buying with cash. Sales manager didn't even care to let me finish what I have to say, jumped straight in with a typical line "let me cal you back in 10" and we all know what he meant lol

Good luck with financing with them, coz they sure will like it. Although, don't forget there are other Mazda dealerships :) never hurt to have options.</text>

< Review>
When showing up to buy a new car please ask for Christian Libby, He was an amazing advisor and went above and beyond to help me find the car i wanted. Now, i dont live in town and he made everything possible to do everything via phone and email then drove the car to my house to sign all the papers. The best experience I've ever had with a dealership. Would definitely recommend Christian to anyone buying a Mazda.

NOW, if i could give the detailer a review and stars there would not be any stars highlighted. If i were this car dealership i would consider hiring a new detailer that knew how to do their job. Drove back down after purchasing the car to get the scratches out of the passenger side door. After detailing there were swirl marks from the buffing left on the car. I had to hire my own detailer to fix the mistake that should have never been made by the dealership. Save your cars paint and wash the car yourself. The "free" car wash is not worth it.

As for the service center, thats a joke. The only reason i went there was because Mazda Corp wouldnt cover warranty on the car unless it was done at the place of purchase. Everyone is extremely rude, doesn't want to hear what you have to say about whats wrong with the car and asks irrelevant questions stating that "they are doing their job." The service center had my car for maybe 5 days and when told it would be done by a certain time, 5 hours later of sitting in the lobby the problem hadn't been solved (mind you i live 3 hours away from culver city). I was sent back to my local dealer to have the problem fixed because they couldnt figure it out. For your own sanity just stay away from culver city mazda.<//Review>

I had reduced my choice of SUV's to three (Honda, Toyota, Mazda)  and Jeff helped me decide on the CX-5.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful and his upbeat personality made the experience fun.

Sales Manager Ben made the actual purchase professional with no stress.  He was extremely accommodating and gave me the impression that my satisfaction was important.  Finance Manager Will was extremely helpful.< /Review>

< Review>
I don't understand how anyone can have a positive experience with this place. After calling there multiple times for service and being transferred around, disconnected and intercepted by what sounded like a  linguistically challenged 14 yr old girl who promised to have someone call me back. I drove down to the dealer and spoke face to face with the service advisor. He assured me the parts for my vehicle recall where in stock and was eager to start the job (all day job) the next morning. I was told there would be a loaner car available. Having worked in the Auto business as a Sales Manager for many years I have learned to always call an confirm the day of the appt. before driving all the way down there.

Well my worst fears were realized when the person I spoke with was no longer in that dept. , another person said He wasn't in today etc.. Then I spoke to Mazda Service since I was allowed to explain everything to 2 people before they told me I was speaking to Volvo Service Dept.
Finally I was told not to bother coming in as the parts were NOT IN STOCK as I was promised the day before. "well some of them but not all of them, they are back ordered"  (favorite term used by dealers to say beat it! its not happening today")Of course all of this said with an apathetic , no apology attitude. Of Course they would have no respect for Customers time, schedules or loss of a morning etc..
I have one word for this place: Dysfunctional!
They are lucky they are selling Mazdas and we owners love the cars or they wouldn't even be in business.< /Review>

How car buying/leasing should be. My wife and I leased a Mazda CX-9 through Tony. We agreed on the trade value and the lease price upfront (over email in fact). When i turned up I was expecting to be directed to talk to the sales manager, changing agreement, etc instead there was absolutely no haggling or changing what was previously communicated (many dealerships in the area would do well to learn from these guys). I am extremely impressed with the dealership, particularly Tony, Max and Rozy. We will be coming here again and recommend anyone looking for either a Mazda or Volvo to visit and ask for Tony. Time is money and I know i can't afford to waste my time. These guys are phenomenal - can't believe i'm saying that about a car dealership! But it's 100% true!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Yes, I know.. did review Culver City Volvo but I do Own a Mazda as well. Even tho they are the same company you can tell they are different. Of course they are more mazda waiting to be serviced than the volvo side so there is more of a wait  From the start they are super helpful. Steve Ruiz was my Service Adviser a couple of weeks ago when i went for an oil change. He was very professional!! and was even joking around with me. He adviced me of what comes with an oil change like a muti-point inspection. When I was in the waiting room he even offered me coffee and water. and was checking if i needed anything. at the end of my service when it came to pay ( here it comes the add ons) he went though all the info of my car. the life of the brakes....tires...battery.. didnt sell me stuff i did not need!!! Steve you are the man!  very honest man and company!!! been coming since 2014. and will keep on going! thanks about Culver City Mazda!!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I few months ago I went to this dealership to take my Mazda 3 5 doors 2011 for oil change adjust a general check after I drove all the way from NYC to LA, I told them that I feel that my car has a little kick that didn't feel right. They charged me almost 500 dollars for oil change and the check for the kick and the breaks as well and didn't find anything, now my car has become worst than before and I believe is the transmission fluid that has to be replace, something that didn't even mention. I wanted to check a new Mazda CX5 and there were not body around from the sales department and the only person that was around told me that the car was locked...

After I took my car out of the this dealership overtime I go over 55 miles per hour the steering wheel starts to shake and my car wasn't like that at all, I called them to complain about that and they told me that I didn't pay for balancing or alignment and also that they did the tire rotation and after that my car is shaking.

The person that I spoke to told me that the manager will call me to see what can be done... I am still waiting for this phone call... In other words stay away from this place< /Text>

I plan to head to CC Mazda for car service,  I went through the  customer reviews , I saw  respond by the owner to the positive review of customers but I didn't see one for negative review,  I assume the owner need to give more attention to the negetive once which help to enhance his/her customer servie at the same time help new customers to consider this place  for their Aout buying or service needs. Don't undermined review owner!!!<//Review>

<text>Beware -- the sales person Jeffrey and I agreed to a price of a Mazda CX 5 over the phone which I confirmed with him to be sure three times. Spent the whole weekend on this --test driving, researching, negotiating. We come to a deal Sunday evening. I got to the dealer to do the final paperwork Monday night, and they tried to jack the price up $200 without me noticing! Maria wouldn't honor our deal and they let me walk. Jeffrey even admitted that we had agreed on the figure, but Maria still said, "no."

Unbelievable. Went to Santa Monica Mazda the same night and they accepted the deal Culver City Mazda rejected.

I was in the market for a brand new car. Previous to visiting Culver City Mazda I had visited many car dealerships of various brands to narrow down my choices including Mazda in Van Nuys. After my visit to the Van Nuys Mazda I was very nervous about dealing with Mazda salespeople. I felt as though there was a lot of dishonesty and contradiction in statements made by the dealership.

I decided to visit Culver City Mazda because of a great offer I received by email. I then made an appointment with Lee. Driving in to Culver City Mazda I saw the small delarship due to construction. I immediately thought this experience will probably be a disaster. To my surprise everyone was very organized. Pulling in we immediately were greeted by someone who took the car I was in and parked it for us. Lee then came outside soon after to greet us and introduce us to Michael who sat us down and discussed the exact car I wanted. He was extremely knowledgeable in all of Mazda cars. I was very impressed. After discussing the type of car, Michael drove us to the other lot to pick out the car. Michael was very friendly and easy to have a conversation with.

Now that I had picked out the car it was time to talk numbers with Lee. Like Michael, Lee was very easy to talk to and addressed all of my concerns in pricing. To make a long story short he wasn't going to let us leave without my new car. I believe Lee was honest in the numbers presented and did what he could to work out a very fair deal for the car that both him and I could agree on.

Next was the financing department. I met with Will who went over all the paperwork with me so that I could understand exactly what I was signing for. He too was very friendly and knowledgeable.

Overall I have to say this dealership was one of the best I have ever been to or purchased a car from. There is almost a family type vibe between all the workers making for a very enjoyable experience for their customers. I definitely recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking to purchase a Mazda. I will more than likely be returning to this dealership when it's time for my next car.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1470938249052, 'text': 'Hello Stephanie, and thank you very much for taking the time to write us a review here in addition to Yelp.

Called ahead to make appointment to change airbag for a recall, get there, drop the car, take Uber to work. Wait 2h, get a call to tell me they didn't have the part and I can come pick up the car. I said ok, will be there in 30min. Take Uber back, get there in 30min. Wants to grab my keys. The car is getting a complimentary "wash". Took 25mins to hose down the car. Worst "cleaning" job I've seen.

Don't waste your time here.< /text>

Horrible, they are always "swamped" ( I drive past it and see tumble weeds just to check how swamped they are). I try and make appointments everytime and never able to get one. STAR mazda is the best choice to go and always go above and beyond for anyone. Culver city mazda won't be receiving my business at all.</text>

Went here to check out a used car. This dealership is TINY. You'll miss it if you're not searching for it. At the end of the day it wasn't the right fit for me, but customer service was welcoming.< /review>

I've been trying to connect to someone to lease a 29,000 dollar car and I can't get a single call back. This is frustrating. Other dealers call me back in no time or simply pickup the phone when I call.
If I was the manager of Culver City Mazda I would be very upset to know that my sales force is not promptly calling back our customers.
I'll still try once more but I wanted this to be made public so CCM can know what is going on.< /Text>

Don't ask a sales person anything even the smallest detail about your car after you've bought it and they have your money.  Magically they know nothing.</review>
