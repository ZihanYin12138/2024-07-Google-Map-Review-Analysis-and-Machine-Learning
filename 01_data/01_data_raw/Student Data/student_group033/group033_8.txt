<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Danny was super helpful in helping me transfer everything over from my old phone to my new phone. I walked in as a boomer, and walked out relatively fast with a brand new functional phone. This was my third AT&T shop, and by far the best experience I have had in the past six months of being a new AT&T customer. This is worth the extra drive, for fantastic customer service. Thank you Dani!</Text>< Rate>

<Text>Joyce was the consumate professional and extremely courteous going above & beyond for me helping me navigate a customer service issue that's been ongoing.
She got me in touch with the right departments until everything was taken care of.
AT&T needs more sales reps just like Joyce. 👍<//Text><response>None<//response><username>Sam Diego Mejia< /username></record>

Victoria G. was very professional from greeting me at the door to even walking me out. she provided service that went beyond AT&T typical service. She sets a service standard the team should applaud. I hope to receive service like that from more team members whenever I shop with AT&T</text>

Excellent service and extremely helpful!  I was trying to switch over from one plan to another and it just wasn’t working online.  The girl working here offered to call into AT&T to make the transfer and was even able to get a higher monthly savings than what I was willing to settle for.  Definitely come to this AT&T for your needs and purchases.  You won’t be disappointed!<//Review>

This is our neighborhood AT&T store.  I have been with AT&T since they were PacBell and I can tell you this is BY FAR the best customer service I have had with an AT&T store...ever.  On our last visit Albert and Will went above and beyond to figure out why only some of the features of the phone wasn't working.  They were knowledgeable, professional, and friendly young men who took sincere interest in our issue and worked until it was resolved.  We had been frustrated for many weeks trying to figure it out, but they did it.  Very grateful for their professionalism and expertise.< /text>

I went in to purchase a new phone this afternoon and Alex made sure I had an incredibly positive experience. He was attentive, patient, positive and funny too! I also watched him assist several other customers while waiting for my new phone and he seemed to exceed everyone's expectations. He took the time to make sure their concerns were addressed and did it with a smile on his face. It was honestly the best experience I've ever had in an AT&T store!<//text>

I usually really dislike going to AT&T stores. I always leave feeling really disappointed and not getting what I wanted. To make a long story short, the Apple store told me I had to buy the iPhone X at the AT&T store because of my upgrade program. It was pretty bogus- they wouldn't let me pay them out of my current iPhone plan to get a new one even though my phone was completely dead. I was 10 days away from my 30 month plan being up. I went to AT&T and was immediately helped by Alberto. I told him my situation and he really listened AND he knew the exact issue I was talking about. He was so incredibly helpful and didn't just tell me to wait until the period was up in 10 days (like they did at 2 other AT&T stores earlier this year). He gave me options, he was going to call AT&T management and urge them to waive the block on my account so I could pay out of my plan that day. He said if that didn't work he would give me a phone to borrow for those 10 days. He was able to get the block waived and I was/am so relieved. He is so knowledgable and I would really recommend seeing him for any phone issues. He is not just another person working at AT&T and telling you no without having a solution. He was so much more helpful than any AT&T employee I have ever interacted with, and it's because he really understood my issue and also found it to be ridiculous that I could not get an upgrade so he figured it out for me. Alberto is the best!< /review>

This store is fraudulent i returned a phone and line the day after i bought, and not only did he not return the phone or line when he said he did, but a month later i see charges for both $1350 on top of my normal bill. The employee kept/stole the phone i thought i returned. No action has been taken on the store’s part. No one answers the phone.</review>

That last bit is really saying something considering I was finding out that all my pictures from the last year were lost with my phone. That is the OPPOSITE of fun.

Alberto is such a life saver & a huge asset to the AT&T store. He was able to help me fix a technical issue in 5 minutes that even several hours on the phone with AT&T Tech Support did not resolve. Even as I was considering cutting ties with AT&T because I was unable to access the 4G on my device for a whole week, I will be staying thanks to Alberto. Give this gentleman a raise!< /Review>

<Review>One of the best Att stores I have been to. They have everything there that one could need. Last time I came in they asked if I had an appointment- which I didnt even think was a thing. Not even sure how to make one and of course when I said no they just put me on a wait list without telling me how to make one, so that I could avoid a line in the future.

When I was there they do have a screen that shows your place in line which was helpful as I was starving. There are many food options close by while you wait... rubios, subway, in and out, pollo loco, pick up sticks, taco bell. That was a good compromise for not having an appointment.

This location was super busy and of course parking was not easy. I dont fault them for that. They alongside their neighbors have a busy market on that corner.

Once I spoke to a rep, I got my issues handled quickly and was in and out.

In the past I may have been to this location at least 10 times. Everytime the service was top notch. Holding my bag, walking me to the door and shaking my hand while thanking me for my business was a very nice personal touch!

I am not sure if that is a corporate mandate but I have been to numerous att stores in the last 18 years and never experienced that.

Good job team Mission Valley. I will be back but please let us know how to make an appointment!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80d95539383a8cc5:0x9801891e809d3bbb</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I love this place. Went In last sunday June third (06/03/2016) for a issue with an early  termination fee that I wasn’t suppose to get charged and the customer service rep Albert got it fixed. Mind you I have been dealing with this fee since February, I’ve talked to multiple people that said they would get the fee reversed and seen no progress. But with him he took the amount of time to get it fixes(3 hours) but it got fixed. So granted if you ever have. Problem with your att/direct tv account come to this location and ask for Albert<//Review>

<text>The At&t store in downtown San Diego I believe off or near Broadway is the absolute WORST STORE EVER. With it being a corporate syore, one would think they would offer better customer care. It is completely the opposite. The guy who assisted me was rude and only intetested in making a sale and not in helping me with what I needed. The manager on duty at the  time was also very rude and did not seem to care about providing good custiner service. I will NEVER recommend this store and even left without purchasing the phones Iwent into buy,  because the whole experience just left a bad taste in my mouth. I have heard a lot of bad things about At&t in the media about just this sort of experience and can now understand why.</text>< Pics>

I don't think this is a real listing. I called and no one answered for multiple rings. They're open til midnight? I don't think so. Click on icon just to the right in google maps. That's the real store. Answered the phone and everything.< /Text>

Have been my vet for 5 years, service has been okay, definitely different after Banfield, definitely moving on after today's experience.

Out of state now and requested a prescription for flea/tick/heart worm for my dog (she has been seen within last 6 months for office visit), they denied to fill my prescription and requiring me to come in for another office visit. Unfortunately my dog contracted fleas this week so disappointing they are denying treatment.

Getting a new client appointment is challenging with other vets due to COVID. All of which mentioned that my current vet would be able to prescribe this to help immediately. Recommend looking elsewhere from here, 1 star experience from today, overall probably 3-4<//text>

< Review>
Their prices are higher than a lot of other vets. They nickle and dime you and they don't explain what was done, how it went and what they think nor any suggestions. It's very robotic. They get the job done, but you're left unsure...at  least that has been my experience. Since they merged the quality seems to have gone down. Last time I went they forgot to give my dog one of his shots and the record of the vaccinations was wrong. Had it not been for the kennel that pointed it out in the vaccination record I would never have known.< /Review>

<Review>I only came here because it used to be the animal hospital. Had a horrible experience today. Took my dog there to get updated shots and teeth cleaning estimate. The office manager came out to collect payment. I told her my care credit card was at home and I could call her in 10 min with the card number. She said no and that she needed to call Carecredit. She said my card had been closed which is true because I have TWO cards and she refused to call them back for the second and advised me that "If I don't pay now I will be sent to collections" and over a matter of $100.

What Banfield needs to realize is what a serious violation of The California Rosenthal Act this is. Threatening a consumer with collections is a very serious offense in California and comes with a statutory award of $1000, actual damages, and attorneys fees. The office manager apparently has no idea what kind of liability she is exposing Banfield to.  This is grounds for escalation to say the least and I am deciding how to proceed or maybe just give a pass because the office manager is just too dumb to realize what a MEGA civil violation this is.

I paid $100, they didn't vaccinate my dog, and threatened me with collections. Need I say more?  BUYER BEWARE DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOG.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Loved Dr Y’s until Banfield took over. Customer experience has been compromised with the change and can’t get test results sent to new vet/boarder — ‘we can’t email results and fax machine is broken’???  On last visit despite committing to previously made boarding reservations were told they were not able to keep reservation because of renovation. I’m sorry kids but our Christmas vacation is canceled!  Stay away from this operation.</text>

< review>
Banfield Vet is a thief! Me and my husband used Banfield in Newbury Park, Ca. for the first few years of my dogs life...we were on their puppy plan that included her wellness checks,vaccines, spay ,etc. It was MONTH TO MONTH payments...and when our dog Annabelle got older, she no longer needed yearly checkups so we told Banfield that we were no longer going to use them(found a better vet anyway). The next thing I know, I got a bill in the mail for the next month's payment. When I called them and told them that it was month to month, they told me that they were going to send me to collections to finish out my year of payments. I reminded them that they did not, I repeat, they did not have any physical or digital copy of my signature anywhere stating that it was a year term. I reminded them that it was month to month and once we were done using their services, we stopped paying because we no longer needed them. they threatened to send me to collections and that's exactly what they did. I have been fighting with them for almost 3 and 1/2 years about this! And now it is still on my credit report for another 2 years because they are still saying that I owe them $400 for payments that absolutely did not need to be made! I am absolutely furious at Banfield because they are total liars! their puppy plan was very clearly month-to-month... It's real easy, when you no longer need the services of your months a month plan, you cancel your plan which is exactly what I did. There is absolutely no signature on file stating anywhere that it was a one-year term! I will never ever use Banfield and let alone their services ever again! And because of this, I will no longer use anything from PetSmart or buy anything from them because they allow such shady business practices inside their store< /review>

Probably the best vet in the area. We bring our two dogs here somewhat frequently now that they are both 13. Dr. Y is nice, personable, and she really seems to genuinely care about her "patients." Twice I've had to come on short notice because of an emergency and they were nothing but accommodating to me and my dogs. I wouldn't consider for one second going somewhere else.</Text>

As long as Dr. Yetishevsky and Dr. Slomowitz stick around, I will continue to bring my pups there. They are the heart and soul of the practice and deliver compassionate, informed care.

Stephanie @ the front desk is also a great asset. She listens well and is pro-active on behalf of the pets and the owners.

I’ve moved around several offices in the Conejo Valley in search of the right combination of skills, price and admin. Dr. Y’s is right up with the best of them.

A word of advice, however - keep your original name. It represents your brand and your brand is your reputation.</review><pics>None<//pics></record>

We have been seeing Dr.Y soon after she opened her doors. It was so refreshing to find a doctor who takes the time no matter how small your issue maybe. We have been able to keep our 13 year old dog comfortable in his final days. This is all do to Dr.Y and her staff. I'm also in once a week with our 8 year old dog who after we noticed he was not acting like himself. Dr.Y jumped on a conservative diagnostic tests for us and quickly for he was type1diabetic. I feel we are a team with both of our dogs and their health issues and never feel like a number.<//text>

<Text>I see Dr. Slomowitz at Dr. Y’s practice and she has been taking care of my senior cat “Toots” for 5+ years.  Toot’s was her patient at her previous practice.  Several years ago she diagnosed him with mast cell cancer and she performed his surgery to remove the mass on his face and splenectomy.  Dr. S also communicated with other specialist,  like Toot’s oncologist, to coordinate his ongoing treatment. Two months ago, Toot’s had another lesion appear on his face, which she successfully removed.  Even though we haven’t seen the oncologist recently, Dr. Slomowitz offered and reached out to her for a recommendation on treatment.  Toot’s can be a difficult patient, but she knows his demeanor and personality by treating him for so many years. She has passion and love for her career and it shines through!  The staff at Dr. Y’s is fantastic and Mr. Toots is treated like a VIP!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Took my cat in, was diagnosed with bladder stones.   Surgery was quite expensive so called cat dr in thousand oaks and quoted a lot less for same surgery.   Took my cat in to cat dr for surgery and they couldn't find any bladder stones on x-ray or with ultrasound, about two weeks had passed since diagnosis.   So operation was canceled.   Maybe it was a miracle!  Maybe the cat passed the stones...  Maybe diagnosis was wrong.  I can't say for sure.   Staff and Dr. Y were friendly, but prices were high end, and Diagnosis may have been wrong.</Text>

Update: After what happened, Jenny, the office manager called and was genuinely apologetic and helpful. She offered to comp us for what we spent at the vet as well as what we paid Animal Poison Control. She made it clear that she was very unhappy about what had happened and let us know that she had already spoken to all the staff and was planning to speak with Dr. Y herself when she returned to the office next week. The fact that she cared so much about their patients definitely earned them back a few points.
________________________
I took my dogs to this vet yesterday. I took them both in bc they were due on at least one of their shots and wanted to get one of their ears checked. The staff at the front were very patient while I looked through my dogs paperwork to figure out which shots they needed, which was nice.

I wasn't seen by Dr. Y bc she was out of the office, but by another vet. He was very kind and thorough. He told me that one of my dogs had tapeworms (which was not what I went in for, I felt like a terrible dog parent bc I never thought my dogs would get tapeworms)! I was thankful that he was so thorough and glad that I took my dogs in for a checkup. He recommended a different topical flea med to the one I had been using and gave both my dogs a prescription dewormer (Virbantel), and we were on our way home.

At this point, I was very happy with my experience. I gave both my dogs the meds as instructed and went about my evening. Before I went to bed I decided to look online for any possible side effects, just so I knew what to look for.

While I was looking this up I noticed the dosage recommendations. According to the manufacturer website, my one larger dog was given twice the recommended dose. At this point I started to get worried so I decided to look on some other websites for information. All of them recommended the same dose which was half the amount I had given my dog.

I called Dr. Y's, but they were closed, so I called the emergency number they recommend on their answering machine. The woman I spoke to from the Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center was so helpful. I explained my predicament to her, she took my info down and called me back within 5 mins. She wasn't familiar enough with the med and recommended that I call Animal Poison Control.

I tried calling one more emergency animal clinic who were also so patient and helpful on the phone. I explained what happened, and they said that the amount I gave my dog was indeed twice the recommended dose. They told me that while the active ingredients in the Virbantel were not very dangerous, it would not be a bad idea to call Animal Poison Control and get their opinion.

It's 11pm at this point.  I called Animal Poison Control. They charge $49 for their consultation, which I paid. They said that the amount prescribed was an overdose, but that the med has a wide margin of safety, so my dog would be fine and to call my vet in the morning. It was a relief to know that this error wasn't going to hurt my dog.

I called Dr. Y's in the morning to check that they meant to give the dose. The woman I spoke to over the phone checked the computer as well as the post-it note that the vet had given her and said that the dosage was correct. I asked her to double check with the vet and call me back when he got in.

When she called back she said that I was right, that the vet had misread the label and that the next time I give my dog the med in two weeks, she only needs to take one. This is when I got even more upset. If I had my own veterinary establishment and INCORRECTLY prescribed the DOSE of a med, I would have been VERY apologetic, comped the visit, something. They said if I bring back the extra pill, that they would pay me the difference. When I said that I'm so glad that it wasn't a more toxic med and asked if this is something that happens, the woman over the phone said that they are human, and they do make errors... Yes, this is true, but you work in medicine, and any errors you make can be fatal, so you shouldn't be so nonchalant about it.</Text>

Our guide for the beach trail ride was excellent, and we had a wonderful time. Wish we could have completely removed the masks as it was outdoors, but understand they need to have rules in place. Definitely a must do!</text>

I made reservations to take my daughter for her birthday. Was notified a couple of hours (by email while I was driving to tour) before our tour that it was cancelled because of wind. We drove three hours, for the tour. We weren't going to Monterey, we went there for the tour.  I thought I had the perfect trip planned for my daughter's birthday only to have it cancelled super last minute. My daughter tried to act like it was fine. But I couldn't help but cry for her. She was looking forward to it.< /review>

< Review>
Went on a private ride with Lindsay last week. Horse was solid and guide was informative and wonderful conversation. I’ve gone on trail rides all over when on vacation and this is exactly as was described for a fair price for the area. Definitely recommend.<//Review>

They took my wife and I out and Lindsey was our guide. She was attentive and knew all the tricks and nuances of the trail and our horses. We ended up being the only people in our group and basically got a private tour. I thought it was a wonderful place to get there first experience in riding horses. After the ride they allowed us to walk around and see all the horses that are being kept there. Shout out to Tuck. He came up to us when he saw us walking around and was super sweet and friendly. I recommend this place for beginners and it's probably great place for veterans horse riders as well.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

My friend and I took the 17 mile tour on horseback at this center. They were wonderful especially Vainca. They gave everyone a great crash course on how to mount and ride each horse. My horse name was Lady A she was easy to handle and all of the horses were well trained and people friendly. Vainca was very knowledgeable and the view of the beach was breathtaking.  I highly recommend them when considering  doing tour in the Pebble Beach area.< /Review>

Horsies were great and the view and tour guide told us a lot of interesting facts along the ride. Staff was really nice to us. Pick this horse trail.< /text>

My daughter and I did the Sunday Beach ride on April 12, 2015 and we loved it! The staff is super friendly and helpful and the Director Robert showed us around the stables and introduced us to some of the horses. The horses were beautiful and well-mannered, too!<//Text>

The lesson staff is the best I've ever had.  The trail riding program is very safe and customers always leave with a big smile on their face because the guides, horses and views are outstanding.  If you want lessons in simply how to ride a horse western style or english or if you want to compete in jumping or dressage Pebble Beach has the staff to help you.  If you would like to learn how to three day event - dressage, jumping and cross country jumping combined PBEC can provide that also.

Pebble offers lessons for all age groups - private or group on your own horse or one of theirs. Plus we ride with the beautiful views and great weather of Pebble Beach all year round.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Me and My wife went horse back riding for Valentines Day... The young lady that took us out was simply amazing I cant take this review out on her... But the unprofessional later at the counter... when I say rude as hell. I scheduled over the ohone and was quoted 1 price and when I got threre I was charged what i was quoted. When the ride ended she met us getting off the horses saying she undercharged me. I got a group rate but since it was just 2 of us it was a private rate. So im paying because you had no business? No one went out after us so either way it would have been just 2 of us. Our company has a conference in Carmel and I was going to recommend we do the horseback riding but I wouldnt spend another dime in that place. So that extra 60 cost you a $3450 day.< /Text>

I went there today and it took me longer to get my cans in the basket they the entire process of getting them weighed and paid.
I will add in response to a couple of other people who posted reviews. The neighborhood where Good Earth Recycling Center is located is not bad, You have Harbor Chevrolet across the street, Good year Tires next door to the west and the Long Beach Airport to the east with a upper middle class neighborhood across Cherry Avenue.< /review>

This place is pretty packed on the weekends. I usually make trip here every 6 months. I recycle plastic bottles, lots of wine and champagne bottles too haha because I love my wine and champagne! Not so many cans. Thanks to my boyfor having a truck to help me out. We bring about 12 large kitchen bags each time and walk away with at least $25 in cash back. What a great way to take care of Mother Earth and give back to environment!< /Review>

Fast service, plenty of recycling bins and they follow strict Covid regulations. There's very little parking so it's best to go early or right before it closes if you have alot to recycle. They're open Mon- Sat from 8am-5pm. Closed Sunday. Highly recommend this recycling center.</text>

They take CRV recyclables by the pound using two large wright scales. The line is never long when I go in the morning. Use their wheeled mesh containers for large amounts. This is different from some CRV places that pay by the piece where it takes forever to put each bottle or can on a little conveyor machine.</Text>

Today I needed to recycle some cans and bottles and I went to Cal State Long Beach at the alumni recycling center but they were closed now they didn't have anything written there warning that there will be closed instead I sat there and it was a waste of time so then I went to The Signal Hill recycling center Good Earth Recycling Center and they were open and I got some pretty good money it seem like I did better there than at Cal State Long Beach anyways you can count on CRV up to 50 cans and 50 bottles or you could do it by weight.</review>

< Review>
I used to go to this recycling center many years ago, but then changed to another one that was much closer to home. But since the one closervto home has closed I decided to try Good Earth again. And as soon as I had all my plastic bottles into their container & started to wheel it up to the opening of the builfding one of the workers took over and I was finished in a flash. That was wonderful. So I was basically in and out of the place in no time.<//Review>

Saturday 6/8/2019 very rude employee.
I didnt like the fact the he refused to use my coupon. I ask for it back and in a very rude manner he said once he has the coupon that he cannot give it back. I really dont see reason why he kept it if didnt honor the coupon. My child work hard to collect his recycle and he left this place very dissapointed.< /Review>

Jerry was great with acupuncture foot massage. $30+tip for an hour foot massage was totally worth it. It was just what I needed after heavy lifting all week. I'm coming back and bringing my husband next time.<//text>

<Review>The very 1st time I came here was straight from the airport from a very long flight coming from Dubai. I received an hour and a 1/2 massage and they worked out all the kinks.
The 2nd time I came here I got a hot stone massage but I don't think the gentleman understood English and he just gave me a regular massage so I was very disappointed in that. He was also not very into it and kept massaging the same place over and over so it wasn't very good.  And the communicate that with him place obviously did not understand what I was saying. Needless to say I didn't leave a very big tip. For generally for what they do and what they charge I would definitely come here again. I would just suggest that he have any special requests that you tell the owner so that he could tell them in their language.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I got a great deal on living social so I decided to try someplace new. This place was great. The staff was friendly. It was clean and professional. The massage was excellent and i left completely relaxed. If you're just looking for a massage and not have to pay for an entire spa package I highly recommend this establishment.<//text>< Pics>

Love their hot stone body massages.  Place is clean.  People are nice.  I have read the reviews.  I have gone many times.  It really makes me sad that the bad reviews are about tips. Just be cognizant that they keep their costs down, and a tip is really what the massage therapist is working for. So know if they spent an hour with you you should give them an hour's pay as a tip.  The rest is to keep the establishment there, I would assume.< /review>

< Review>
These people are crazy. If I could give a no star rating I would because they don't deserve a one. I went in for a full body massage. Afterward, I came out to pay at the counter with my card. The massage was $45. The guy asks me how much tip do I want to put on it. I told him I had cash. So I handed him $8 for the tip. About 18%.  He counts it and gets mad at me, then throws it on the counter and says, "ten dollars." I said, "WHAT? Say look here man, don't you EVER tell me how much tip to give." Then I took my $8 off the counter and put it back into my pocket. He then says, "come on give tip." I'm like, "aw HELL NAW you ain't getting nothing now buddy." He then takes my card out of the machine and throws it to the side and wasn't going to give it back to me until I gave him some money. I had to reach over the counter to grab my card, then I walked out. I don't know where these businesses get off thinking that tips are mandatory, but they're NOT! DON'T go here! If you can find another massage place to go to, do it. I don't recommend them AT ALL.</Review>

<time>1560094029384<//time><review>This place does have tipping issues! I thought I would stop by and try the place. I am not a bad tipper if the massage or service is good, but I won’t give good tips to people who are lazy and with attitude. For starter, I was really exhausted and probably was half drowsy to begin with. But it’s a tester for slacker. The lady knew I was about to snooze and she already soften up all her massage and barely massaging. You know what, fine, I let it go. I didn’t expect much from this place anyways. I think the 60min foot massage, I barely had any foot massage done. It s’aida back, head, shoulder 30min and foot 30min, probably a trend in California for Asian massage, you laid on your back and they will do your whole body. I get that, no problem, but don’t be lazy and barely putting any effort to the massage.

And the tipping part... she was standing probably next to the manager at the counter. The massage was $25USD, and I wasn’t going to give her big tips, but As soon as I pull out a $5 for her.... she snitch it so quickly, didn’t thank nor give eye contact! My god... are these ladies being paid or what? I feel like they live on their tips??? Mind you, it’s a 20% tip for the chosen service.

I won’t recommend this place. There are better place to go and even cheaper.<//review></record>

Visited j&j for the first time and requested a 90 minute combo massage. My masseuse took frequent casual extended breaks, including 2 trips to the toilet. She finished the overall massage after 75 minutes. When I came to pay, I tipped her over 20 percent and she complained that she wanted and expected more tip from me Unbelievable!< /review>

In my opinion it’s a great value for the price.
Attentive to requests, and my massage lasted the full time. I’m posting a photo of most recent prices.</text>

<review>*CHEAP IS NOT GOOD (and Good is Not Cheap)*Very dissatisfied. J & J may be less expensive than other local massage parlors, but their budget prices surely match their poor, poor massage quality!

I DO NOT RECOMMEND J & J as a genuine, bona fide massage establishment.(at least, in my cases!)  Already have spent a lot of money, gave J & J THREE chances to redeem themselves, but J & J has miserably failed to offer the appropriate muscular acupressure relief I sought to get there in the first place.
1st visit:(the most expensive session)
The masseur spent 15 to 20 minutes just randomly and ridiculously ignorantly touching various parts of my back (I swear, if I had eyes on the back of my head, I could swear he must have been multitasking by touching my back for 20 minutes, while either texting or watching HULU on his mobile device!😠)

Then he, neither systematically nor knowledgeably massage my muscles in the highly regarded Chinese tradition of acupressure. The so called masseur Just randomly touched here and there without rhyme or reason.

When finished, I made sure to address my dissatisfaction with the man who appeared to be the manager (owner) while in the presence of the bad masseur.

All this manager did was, Smile and nod his head in agreement, while saying idiocies (in in his make-believe, "fake news" broken English) such as: [input heavy Chinese accent here. Hey what!? Relax! I'm ethnic myself, too! I can say this, (freedom of speech) my personal testimonial, without being denounced or condemned! With all do respect to the wonderful Asian community, my ethnic group also gets stereotyped in a humorous light, too!]
"Oh, That So Good! You No Like it" "That too bad!" Why You No Tell him, He No Good?" (I'm  obviously exaggerating. I'm pretty upset!) I said: this is a quiet place, sir, and you do not allow loud talking in this massage Hall. without disturbing the other clients and patrons.

I asked him, point blank if he was going to give me a credit or a partial reimbursement for my terrible experience. The man Totally ignored me and made no attempt to remedy the situation.

I did return to give J & J to give them a second chance. The next time I returned I had a different masseur.  this guy looked like he just came out of the kitchen and was more interested in what was for dinner than paying attention to me.!
This guy was by far, worse than the first one. He kept making random but more exaggerated back and forth hand motions that even hurt my face my ears, my temples and my neck!

I stopped him in the middle of it all, before he could do more damage.
(No one wants a repeat bad session)

I said, "Stop, sir I want a better massage therapist who knows what they're doing. I do not want to continue with you any further with you." (He just walked off and yelled in Chinese  for somebody new

This was 15 minutes into my massage. Then out comes this other massage therapist  who did a good job at giving me a very soft, unnecessary baby acupressure. She lulled me to sleep, did an efficient job at rubbing my body, but again, did not do the correct textbook  acupressure.

All she was more concerned about was how much money I was going to tip her afterwards. The massage was $25, I gave her a $12 tip. That's 50% gratuity right on the nose!! She made faces at me  and mumbled something unpleasant  sounding in Chinese.
I asked her if the tip was okay. She cynically exclaimed "it okay"..  Smirked, and walked away.

Again, the owner cared not to address my dissatisfaction, but rather, focused on the improvement from the first massage therapist to the next one I was assigned.

Needless to say. I appreciate J & J  for being an established massage parlor in Pasadena. What I dislike is : J & J not remedying this poor service situation by providing me a credit towards a future session.

Not Happy! Still expecting a credit.<//review>< Rating>

$40 for a 70 minute massage and the women went all the way until the end. I was sore on my shoulders and let her know so she focused on that area. It was a great message - must tip $10< /review>

I usually judge a Thai place based on the Kra Pao ( minced pork basil) and this one definitely scored well! Wish they actually cranked up the spice a notch! Sticky rice pudding was alright, a bit too sweet but I will come back here.</Review>

The ladies who serve are so sweet and earnest, it just make us feel cared for and happy. For dishes, my go-to's are Tom Kha, Pad Thai, Pad See-Ew, Spicy Eggplant, and of course the Mango Sticky Rice always has to end our meal.< /Text>< Pictures>

I had the seafood noodle soup which was based on a pork bone broth. Flavour was not there and the dish was bland. Prices also seemed to be on the high side for similar places in the East bay. I won't be back.</Review>

Really good food! Just make sure you bring cash - they don't take card. However, there is an ATM inside (but you will be charged a fee for using it, so it's better to get some cash before hand).< /Text>

Very bland compared to any thai food within 3-5 miles.  As well as overpriced comparatively. To be honest  if you want good thai food go to Chai Thai it absolutely dominates this place. 🤔</review>

The Tom Ka Kai was just ok, not rich and full flavored like at other Thai restaurants. The vegetable dish was ok too. Absolutely the worst Pad Thai ever in my decades of Thai food, and the spring rolls had tough wrapping and so-so filling. With one Thai ice tea and onehot tea, the bill was $55 for an inedible lunch no one enjoyed. Was this an off day? We'll never know because we'll never return. Service was ok, but we're not there just for the service.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< Name>

Enjoyed all our food. Great attentive service. We had the mojarra frita, the Camerone rancheros and of course some ceviche. Everything was fresh and seasoned to perfection. Would for sure come again.< /review>

Muy sabrosos los platillos de verdad. Very delicious, good prices and big portions. And the customer service is excellent. You can tell the cooks really know how to make a real authentic mexican seafood plate. Plus the place is clean and plenty of seating space.< /text>

<date>1490582423745<//date><username>Christina Tapia< /username><pictures>None<//pictures><Text>So I read all reviews and decided to give it a try. Instant regret. Customer service was extremely poor. We recieved no refills. Ordered a Michelada which was watered down, a margarita that tasted like syrup. I got the Fried Fish plate and it was super salty. The girl who took our order didnt write it down and they didn't bring the food ordered. The waiters didn't know which table ordered what. It was like playing Wheres Waldo. Who ordered this!?!? No sense of direction.Very disappointed. The only reason I gave 1 star is because I needed to rate. I wish this would allow for negative stars. This place is 86. Two thumbs down. Van De Kamps from the frozen section at your local market would have been more satisfying!!!< /Text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<rating>3<//rating><username>Karla Garcia</username><Review>(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went to that place first, the food is great but I didn't like the service because they kept us waiting 2hr 30min for our food. There were people who came after us and served their food, families of 6 or 5 people arrived and even so they served their food first than we were also 5. The waitress who attended us was a very good person but my family noticed that I was even shaking because there were only 3 people (the waitress, a waiter and an old man who was the chef) in the restaurant helping. The poor man there was picking up the plates from the tables and making the food. As I said the food very good and the service very bad. The waiter did not help at all. He saw that the waitress needed help with the tables and he just stared at her. I give it 3 stars for the food, the waitress and the chef.

Yoa ayer fui a ese lugar en primero la comida esta buenisima pero no me gusto el servicio porque nos tuvieron esperando 2hr 30min por nuestra comida. Habia personas que llegaban despues de nosotros y les servian su comida, llegaba familias de 6 o 5 personas y aun asi les servian su comida primero que a nosotras que tambien heramos 5. La mesera que nos atendio era muy buena persona pero mi familia noto que hasta estaba temblando porque solo habia 3 personas(la mesera, un mesero y un señor ya viejito que era el chef) en el restaurante ayudando. El señor pobrecito ahi estaba recogiendo los platos de las mesas y haciendo la comida. Como dije la comida muy buen y el servicio muy malo. El mesero nu ayudo en nada veia que la mesera necesitaba ayuda con las mesas y nomas se le quedaba viendo. Le doy 3 estrellas por la comida, la mesera y el chef.</Review>< resp>

Friendly and informative staff. They didn't have exactly what I was looking for but went out of their way to connect me with the company that could get it. That kind of customer service is worth 5 stars all day every day and guarantees that I'll be back.<//review>

< Review>
The staff and owner are knowledgeable, helpful and excel at customer service. They do carry organic feeds from my favorite mill, Scratch n Peck. While grain feed for chickens is awesome!
Highly recommend for all pet and livestock needs.</Review>

With the shelter-in-place recommendations I was concerned about my parents going shopping for hay.  In three minutes I was able to get a load of alfalfa and some orchard grass hay scheduled for delivery.</text>

<review>A great place to buy feed, pet supplies, farm animal supplies and medications here in the mountains. Every spring and fall they have baby chicks and sometimes other baby fowl.

Their prices are reasonable for the mountains and they are open daily with knowledgeable friendly staff. They bring all feed to your vehicle and load it for you.</review>< user_id>

Caters to farm and ranch, but also a great source for better quality cat and dog foods.  Helpful staff, always offered to load the 20+ pound bags of feed into my truck for me.<//Review>

I am use to salesmen that know what usually works and not rather quickly as I am a mechanic from S.F. and dealt with old school sales menthat knew right where to go for the parts needed most of the time. If Valley Auto Supply didn't have the part then they would always find it! Within a reasonable amount of time of course!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>I haven't visited this store yet but I've called a few different times to get no answer and then it hangs up. Not exactly sure as to why no answer during open business hours. If they are understaffed then hopefully they will fix it or if they had people call in sick then can't they multitask? If they have the staff and all then in my opinion this store has some pretty bad customer service. Hope I'm wrong!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1523442467449, 'text': 'We take your comment seriously and we are investigating this in order to improve.

Employee #5 Mike was very rude to me when i was asking for the(what i now know is called)a rear break hardware kit. I didnt know the name of what it was called and he acted like i was inconveniencing him by not kniw the part exact name. I was calling it a Springs and pulley system. He rudely told me that not what it called and treated me like im stupid. DONT DO ANY BUSINESS HERE. Im not a mechanic but i do change my own break pads . Dont buy part from them. Rude and THEY TREAT YOU crappy<//Text>

My husband and I have been booking dancers for a few years. We booked from Spice 1 and Perfect 10 for years. It was pretty good service but some of the girls are kinda messy at those place. Figured it was the industry. But one night Perfect 10 boss ripped us off 20 mins of our show. The dancer told us he was trying to get her to another show early so was stealing our time. So we called Pulse. And WOW The girls at this place are beautiful. We got Victoria, Then Liz and then Lucy. Top notch and all we so fun to be with. They entertained and left us in awe. Thank you and we will only book from this place from this day on.<//Text>

Me and my buddies have ordered from other companies in the past but by far PULSE IS THE BEST!!! The girls look just like their photos sometimes better. We've been going through Pulse for quite some time and every time we are amazed🤩 We celebrated the best and most memorable bachelor party!

We had a few girls come over but one of them caught my eye victoria was phenomenal we‘ve ordered her quite a few times now. She is very professional, classy, and beautiful with a awesome personality. I respect her as a dancer and happy she always has a smile on her face as if every time she sees us is the first time. Anyone who had her will say the same thing I’m sure if anything else they have to be jealous. Whoever gets to call her there’s is a lucky fella #1 company in Fresno hands down👍🏻< /review>

<Text>Awesome experience from beginning to end! To begin with Paige was the greatest girl to work with to set things up. She is the best. The only thing I regret is not requesting her to see her in person. The girls that came were Liz, Victoria, a new girl whose name I unfortunately forgot, and Mariah who I secretly fell in love with. All the girls were amazingly beautiful and had personalities to match. We’ll definitely gonna be seeing these girls again. Love, Love, Loved these girls!!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Called for a few girls in Reedley/Dinuba area and called around a got a great deal from 1st class...we picked out a few girls and the girls showed up were not the ones we booked. We looked around and try this place and the prices were higher, but the girls looked hot in the site. And wow they were prettier than there pictures.

The girls were spectacular!! Besides being absolutely sexy, the girls I got for my buddy's bachelor party were extremely cool, fun and very professional. I am going to recommend this agency to all my friends, and highly suggest anyone who is looking for a great night of partying and fun to use these girls as well!< /review>

I travel all over the nation working with local stripper companies. I have dealt with a few local companies here in Fresno and none were ever professional. I started working with Pulse and now we have a great relationship over the past 2 years and helping each other.< /review>

I love Pulse Entertainment. As an Adult Film star, This place is the best when it comes to private stripping. Ive worked at Pulse part time when I'm in the area and they are nothing but professional. I noticed this company had other adult actresses like Cali Carter & Summer Brielle. So I gave it a try and I loved this place. I will always dance for this place when I'm visit family in Central valley. Its #1 for sure.< /review>

I wanted to leave a review for a while so heres to it, I called and got 3 dancers for a Super bowl party back in Feb. The boy's wanted big breasted women and Pulse provided. The girls were super beautiful and they put on an exotic dancer show, no one will forget. We were going to get another hour but everyone was pretty drunk and passing out. But yes Pulse has the hottest strippers for hire in the valley. We will call again this summer from a few girls for my bf birthday.< /Text>

Expect nothing but the best when you order from Pulse Entertainment is honestly all I can say! After ordering from them I will never order from any other stripper service again! They get a HUGE thumbs up from me. I recommend them to anyone and everyone. Real girls unlike the other companies, amazing service. Just a big 10/10 ! #teamPulse</review>

I've always wanted to be an exotic dancer and started at Golddiggers strip club. I was only there for 2 weeks. The management was disrespectful and the other strippers there were rude. I quit went to city lights and the same thing there. Maybe cause I was a white pretty blonde girl. I don't know. I end up at spice and WOW it was scary. I was going to quit and stop for a few weeks and I found Pulse Entertainment. I became a Pulse girls and it was the best experience ever. From all the managers to the other girls, it was a family. So respectful and professional. I wish I would have worked here first. I made really good money and brought a brand new car in a month. I had to move to Utah and I've worked at clubs in Las vegas and LA but Pulse in Fresno has been the best. I miss you guys and hope to one day come back.<//text>

<text>Went to this club with my best friend on Friday and we spent two hours getting drunk and hanging out with the Hottest girl in the club.  It was a very good atmosphere.  We thought Some of the drinks were a little bit on the expensive side but the house wine was very very good. It was exciting to finally come to the club that all of my male coworkers were talking about. this club, definitely 5 stars We're going back.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1557126183072, 'text': 'Thank you for keeping us #1 in the valley and showing local business your support.

I’ve been ordering entertainers for my work here at Sams Club on Blackstone for about 4 years now. We’ve used a few services and we just found this company. They blew it out of the park! The girls were professional and beautiful! They were the ones in the photos and they did an amazing party! We will only book with this place from this point on. Thank you :) A+ the best.<//Text>

Hired two strippers from the Pulse entertainment last night for my male bffs bachelor party. I’d never hired female strippers and wasn’t sure what to expect. He was very happy with the girls they sent and called to thank me. Thanks guys.< /Text>

<review>I've been to a lot of Bachelorette parties before actually throwing one myself last summer. Other male entertainment websites had fake photos and misrepresentations, but Pulse Entertainment was honest and truly the real deal. My girlfriends are still talking about that party til this day, saying it's the best they've ever been to! You won't find this kind of quality in entertainment elsewhere! Sexiest strippers fresno.</review>< time>

<review>So I went to google Strippers in Fresno & Strippers for hire and Pulse Entertainment Fresno kept coming up over and over again. We went ahead and order from the other companies cause they were cheaper and got more girls and they were terrible! So we search Private strippers in Fresno and got Pulse Entertainment again. We called and got 2 strippers and oh my god they were hot! So professional and got fully naked!
There bouncer was super cool too! We will order again from Pulse Entertainment. www.Strippers559.com is the best. So is www.PulseGirls.com and www.Dancers559.com< /review></record>

Ive also booked both of them. There are other places to order strippers in the valley. But you will not find the quality and the customer service that Pulse Entertainment has. They are the best Strippers in Fresno, Period!
Judge yourself. Look at the web site. No old man answering there phone. The booking girls are cute and sweet. And the best part? The girls are smoking hot!< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
had a party last night and called around. Pulse prices were a little higher so we booked with perfect 10. The strippers showed up and was disgusting. They were also an hour late. We canceled and called Pulse entertainment and they got 2 hot strippers here in 15 mins. I didnt catch there names but wow they were hotter than there pictures. We called and got more girls later and they were just as beautiful and dressed the part. #1 best for sure</review>

<Text>Pulse is the best. I have called and got dancers from other places but ever since we started getting girls from pulse, We have had the best time. The girls are professional, Fun and did I forget to mention BEAUTIFUL! The pictures of the girls are the real girls unlike the other stripper companies who post old pictures or fake one. I own a PHO 99 and we will never call anywhere else when we book strippers. Pulse entertainment is #1 Don't call anyone where else. - Ordered last night and got Mariah and Victoria. Girls we drop dead gorgeous and they never let us down.< /Text><user_name>Bobby Chia<//user_name><Date>1580478967673<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Fantastic experience. It was grown up sexy in every right way. The Strippers were beautiful, conversational, and partied right along side us while keeping things professional and performing like absolute rockstars. They travelled down to the lake near Fresno to celebrate a bachelor party with us on a private party charter boat...it was an exceptional experience.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Was having a get together with my boyfriend, his brother, and his friend. We hired Wendy for two hours, she finished changing at 9:49. She was fun and seemed like she was genuinely having a really good time. So after a while the timer she set goes off and she asks if we want her to stay another hour. My boyfriend’s brother says no we don’t want another hour because you got here at 9:49 and it’s 11:20. Super nice to her about it. She left 30 minutes early, he just let the driver know that she had shorted him. So we call the company to let them know what had happened and they tell us that the reason she gave for leaving early was because we “pressured her to do coke.” This is a very nice house in a nice neighborhood and we are professional people, there was no cocaine here. That was just the thinly veiled excuse she gave because she didn’t want to get in trouble for leaving so early. Which is obvious because she had set the timer before she started dancing and it went off early! Plus she asked if we wanted another hour 😂 We have ordered from this company many times and it has been great every time, my family and friends are personally insulted. ...Oh and she got her bloody bandaid and some blood on the 4 grand goose feather couch 😂 I just picked it up and didn’t say anything to her lol. Didn’t even mind. Not only did she lie about how much time she had been here, but she tried to cover her tracks afterward by making up more lies. Wendy disrespected us and our home and the manager knows how to contact us for a refund</Review>< Time>

Go to their facebook page and you’ll see the people they post about are no longer on their website....because they dont work there anymore. Ive been baited and switched multiple times by them. Dont try to order Aurora, Cassandra, Mariah, Scarlett, Natalie or CoCo, you will end up with someone else. This company is a joke and really an escort provider.

< review>
The best in the central valley. Ive ordered from a number of different stripper places like spice one and perfect 10 for my parties and most girls are disgusting. But a friend told me to call Pulse. So I did. And Ive gotten nothing but the best service from the phone person to the strippers. The driver guys are pretty cool too. But Pulse hasn't let me or my friends down. I can tell you from the other reviews Ive read, There fake and don't waste your time with the rest. Pulse is the best :) I wouldn't boook anywhere else.<//review>

<Review>Best male and female strippers in Fresno. Needed 10 exotic dancers for a corporate 50th year anniversary party last week. Didn't know who to call since this wasn't a bachelor and bachelorette party.  Pulse said not to worry and made sure all of their male and female strippers were on time. I was very impressed with their attitudes and for keeping it PG professional. If I ever need strippers in Fresno. you will be getting another call. Thank you from Winco!< /Review><Name>Mark Little<//Name>< Pics>

To be honest, my friends were visiting from out of town & invited me to tag along. If it had been up to me I would have had a nice bar set up with drinks & such; than again I didn't book this event so it's certainly possible it wasn't supposed to be handled like that.

Being in the industry for many years, it's something that I don't usually involve myself with. Not because I don't enjoy it; more so because for me it's more of a relaxing environment (nightclubs, strip clubs, etcetera) & I have a lot of lady friends that are entertainers. In this intimate setting there was no escaping it. Please don't misunderstand. I willfully declined many times until, well, I didn't. It wasn't because she was a legit top notch adult Entertainer but because she was genuine. I think that's an important quality to have in any industry & within any profession. It is something you have or you don't.

My friends hired 3 girls. All of which were nice, & extremely attractive. I only remember two of their names; Tiffany aka Carpe Diem & the super adorable, 'genuine' & extremely sexy Victoria Sercets. Yes of course I knew who she was but that didn't matter because I've worked with so many people in this world that are of high celebrity status & it usually is unfortunate because after working with them I don't want to listen to their music, read their books, watch their movies, or really want to work with them ever again. This was not the case. It almost made me want to hire them again on the spot for a private showing. Lol. Who knows, maybe I will. Lol.

All in all, this Event was extremely well handled on their part & although I didn't get to book it on my own, Pulse entertainment delivered.

Again, thank you Pulse girls I can't remember her name (sorry), Tiffany aka Carpe Diem, & a special thanks to Victoria; the first dance I willfully asked for in close to 20 years. That is a true feat.

See you all around town! Cheers.</review><Resp>{'time': 1540033336220, 'text': 'Thank you! Were glad you were happy.

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I have been living in California for 20 years and counting, and when I first heard of this place, I had my own doubts at first--would be strip club, unclean setting, etc. After the first trips there, all my doubts flew out the door.

The overall setting is nice and casual. Perfect place to go for an end-of-week or end-of-work drink. A few months into my visits here, I didn't even know it's housed in a historical building; that turned into a "Aha" moment for me. As for the women here, they are very approachable to make your night more relaxed. When they go on stage, you know they got the dancing talents; when not on stage, they really are nice girls to be around, even if it's only for a few hours.

If you ever have any misconsemptions about a club like this, give it a try one night,  and even if you pass by, you'll be hooked. Whenever I have the means to go out, I'm here.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1557126178033, 'text': 'Thank you for keeping us #1 in the valley and showing local business your support.

Amazing Del Taco! Always clean, super friendly staff, and prompt service.

The only questionable thing is the fact that the building is almost like an island. The drive-thru quite literally wraps around the entire place so be careful of your little ones and make sure to hold their hand!<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Wow, food was terrible. We went in and ordered and since it dis take a little bit longer we figured the food would be fresh and tasty. Boy were we wrong. The bean and cheese burritos were skinny with no filling at the top, scant amount of cheese and negligible green sauce, plus the beans were pasty and the tortillas were "wet". The tacos didnt have anything inside (pictures provided), and the "chili" cheese fries was really just fries with red sauce and a sprinkle of cheese. We had taken our order home and open our bags up to this nonsense. I'm glad we are moving from this area soon so we dont have this as the closest Del Taco location.<//review>< pictures>

They had no beans ready for the drive thru. What fast food Mexican restaurant doesn't have beans? For real! That's the staple to all Mexican food minus only the tortilla... what gives. But the night shift lady that works here is froggen awesome. You dont see that kind of customer service anymore. Unfortunately this was not her shift or I'm sure the beans would be there and ready.< /review>

There have been multiple visits to Del Taco at A LOT OF LOCATIONS where this seems to be the problem. Then again, a lot of different fast-food chains are having the same problem. Recently, they've been losing me to Taco Bell. But I miss Del Taco so figure it out :)</Review>< Pics>

Considering its Mexican/American fast food,  I was impressed. The tacos were almost as good as my own.
The woman working the night shift was so friendly and courteous.  She's probably around 50 to 60 years old,  over 5' 4", white, a slight southern accent and is wonderful. She definitely should get a hefty raise so she doesn't go elsewhere to work. She is one reason why my deceased husband used to frequent that specific Del Taco. Now I know why. 😉😁<//Review>

Does del taco was pretty good!! I would definitely go back they are pretty fast!! I strongly recommend if you're in the area be sure to stop by this.

I love the prices. I was able to get two tacos small fry and a drink for $4. And I bought another taco off their value menu. Taco only cost$0.79 can't go wrong with that.

Especially if you're on a budget like me. Especially you get three tacos for under $2 on taco Tuesday. My family and I are sure to get tacos for the whole family. And believe me I have a big family.

It can get a little crowded sometimes, but it's worth the wait. The staff is pretty fast.< /review>

I don’t like Del Taco at all but my boyfriend does and to see this from a fast food place like this -> WOW! She is the best worker I’ve ever met in my life. Because of her attitude and AMAZING customer service we decide to always get del taco at night to enjoy our meal and time with an amazing person ! She’s around 50-60’s, blonde hair, kind of a southern accent, and always has a smile on her face !!! Thank you Tammy !!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Parking is a bear. The location is often busy and the older folks spend much time there, i think it is a second home for some. The employees were friendly, the manager was helping out by taking orders and he was doing a great job. The food was hot (usually is), the french fries are to die for. I try not to eat here, only once a week no thanks to a co-worker.<//text>

<Text>Hands down the worse customer service ever. First I wasn't greeted until standing in the lobby for two minutes even though there were only two guests. Secondly when I received my order there were no napkins and when I asked for sauce the lady behind the counter said, " sauce is on the table" I only go to Del Taco for the prices but that is out. Two thumbs down!<//Text>< rating>

All the employees were SUPER nice and pleasant. Never been to a Del Taco that had such nice employees. This store really stood out in employee and customer care.< /Review>

With beans and cheese. I added f photos of the bathroom because the bathrooms are outside and immaculate.  Ive been in bathrooms on the inside and have been terrible. I applaud this place for the up keep of their outdoor  bathrooms. 5 stats for that.<//text>< Pictures>

<time>1566245396523< /time><rate>5<//rate><review>I prefer Del Taco. Not only is it a good bang for your buck, it's one of the last remaining dollar menus to be seen. This particular location doesnt cut corners; its filled with knowledgable & friendly staff that make the process for newcomers a breeze. They also haven't switched recipes, so it's more appetizing in my humble opinion. It's a great every day food joint and doesn't require passing the needed requirements for dine in and high value restaurants,  which is why it gets 5 stars.  But if you're feeling like its bland in any way... order it BOLD. You'll thank me later.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

One of my preferred spots for tasty cheap food. Had a friend come into town and asked me to take him here again. Prices are appropriate for the quality. Food is like a restaurant in Jacksonville I liked.<//review>

This place is always great! Friendly, awesome staff, and always clean. Food is ok, it's a Del taco so if you like it then this is the one to go to. I've live here for 25 years and this place has been the best since I could remember.< /review>

Taco Tuesday???
I went through the drive thru at 2:55 pm but was told after I put in my order that I was too early for the Taco Tuesday discount!  Come on!  Five minutes!!!  I am sure my phone will not ask for another survey because I doubt I'll be back!< /Text>

<review>This is hands down the best Del Taco EVER! The late night crew is my fave... They know us and are hilarious! "Blink twice hubby if she's abducting you... Just cuz you're married doesn't mean he has to come home yet... Set this man free!" "And yes of course there's a fork for your fries... Why do you still even bother asking? You kids drive safe!" Love them!  lmao</review><Date>1556318577605<//Date><response>None<//response>< user_name>

<Text>This is my favorite place for a quick bite to eat or to enjoy some free time with my wife. The service is great, employees are polite and food accuracy is precise. It's great that it's just within walking distance of my place and no matter what time of the day it is...its open 24/7. Highly recommend this restaurant in particular. Other Del Tacos don't compare. My word is as good as gold.< /Text>< username>

Every time I go there, I'm greeted by their sweet employees. The costumer service alone will make you want to come back. They'll quickly remember you if you're a regular and you'll become friends with them before you know it. If they mess up on your order, they're super sincere and are quick to fix it. It's fast food, so of course it's going to be as great as fast food can get. Definitely go here if you're in the mood for a late night meal.<//Review>

<Review>Fast and with an A rating on the window from code enforcement you can feel comfortable to eat at this establishment without having regrets. That said the restroom shouldn't have any factor in the quality of service, because people are people. Know what I meant by that.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< user>

I've gone to this Del Taco for years since 2007. Ms. Tammy from the drive thru is very pleasant and very caring about her customers needs/satisfaction and if she makes an honest mistake she will compensate you for it and owns it. In my opinion her and the evening staff are fast and reliable and professional. My fries are always the way I order them extra well done. Tonight was remarkable. Thank you Tammy, I will definately be returning more often, I would give you 10 star rating for your careness and honesty if I could, if google allowed it😊< /text>

Okay love this del taco the staff is amazing and they neverrrr mess up my food. But gave it 2 stars because of the new change with the nacho cheese. The new white cheese is soupy and disgusting. And it's on actual nachos! Nachos are supposed to have um...nacho cheese! Not that soupy stuff. And it's grainy and kind of flavorless. The consistency is not like  the picture shows it's  watery. It Used to be my favorite for the macho nachos and the nacho cheese fries. Going back to my old favorite...taco bell. They have nachos too with real nacho cheese!< /text>

I went in after i got off work tonight around 130 am  sat in the drive thru for about 20 min. While sitting there i downloaded the app seeing as the ad for it said 2 FREE del tacos. I open the app do what i need to do and click on redeem for my tacos. I get to the window and the guy said they dont take coupons. So i asked him how am i supposed to get my tacos if you dont take them  can i give you my name and you can give them to me later and he refused to do anything. I get home and i eat my food and my tacos are cold, my soda is flat. I was highly disappointed by my visit tonight. I live in the middle of 3 different del tacos and always choose this one because theyre always the best. But not tonight. I was very disappointed  will definitely being calling corporate to get it handled and be speaking with the general manager.<//text>

Hmmm...I have mixed feelings about this place because the service I get from the late night ladies is not as friendly as the service I get from the gentleman at night... I dunno. Also, last time I bought food, there was hair in my quesadilla, which I know, things happen and they would've replaced my order on the spot...but I've my lost my appetite for this place so I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.< /review>

Honestly places like this I believe are hit n miss and in my opinion and experience this location was a miss unfortunately. Del taco has been a staple in my family for many years and my mom and I just happens to be by this location and stopped for lunch and we went through the drive through. It wasn't busy at all and I had read really bad reviews on this location on Yelp. We went anyways giving the benefit of the doubt but I was very skeptical. People have had credit card fraud and terrible card handling issues there and I wasn't going to be next so we paid cash. But the girl running the window was very rude and curt and there were things from our order which were wrong, but not bad enough to go back. The service was very slow as well. We personally will not be returning but that doesn't mean we didn't just catch them on a bad day. Hope this helps someone!< /Text>
