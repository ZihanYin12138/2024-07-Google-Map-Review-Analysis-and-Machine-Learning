< Review>
Amazing margaritas and great burgers. We've been going to Mango's once a month for Bingo night and the food and service is always amazing, even with how packed and crazy it gets.
The mango margarita is definitely my favorite, the garlic fries are perfect.
Large beer selection. Outdoor seating. Friendly service.</Review>

If I could give it less I would, you can find a much better club and a better priced club to spend your time and money. I was dancing and enjoying myself with a friend at the mango club visiting Sacramento after my grandfathers funeral. I had previously eaten seafood that didn't sit right, so I threw up over exerting myself. It almost hit someone as I ran to the trash as fast as I could(I don't believe he was hit, but that doesn't really matter due to me being apologetic). The gentleman who almost got hit threatened me and attempted to attack me, the security guard stopped him and asked me if I could come with him to speak and thinking he'd solve the little issue I agreed to follow(plus you don't say no to security during confrontation). He walks me to the restroom to clean up and explain what happened. I explained myself as soon as I washed up and came out. He walked me outside the club( I still think we're solving the issue and that he might throw the other guy out) and says the manager(or owner) is kicking me out for being over intoxicated..i didn't buy one drink nor did I drink once that night, my friend even vouched for me and he was also sober. I am a professional dancer, so I literally bboy in front of the security guard and do dance moves that need sobriety to pull off with grace to prove i'm sober and he smells my breath. The security guard believes me and leaves to speak with the manager. The managers response is that he's not changing his mind, not granting me a refund, nor does he apologize and the security guards insult and harass me outside the club as I wait for my friend, because I didn't want him to lose his money at this over priced club. Once I verbally defend myself from the guards they proceed to say I have to wait for my friend across the street or they'll call the cops. I respond by silently crossing the street in frustration of wasting money on a poorly ran and rude club. My friend comes out an hour later claiming that they we're harassing him inside due to defending me previously as I was being removed. I did not claim anything that wasn't true, nor have I blown anything about this story out of proportions thing during this review. DO NOT GO HERE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, LET THEM GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR AT LEASE GET A BETTER OWNER/MANAGER!

I will leave a picture of myself in hopes they remember me and that they get their act together.</Review><Response>None</Response>< name>

It looks like a sport bar, our server was super nice, really cool. The Cereli burger was tasty, quality meat, and the avocado makes everything better!. The BBQ burger was good but nothing special. I had the Moscow Mule, really liked it. We also ordered the pineapple cider, so good! If you go, have to try it.<//Review>

<Review>Waited for 30 mins for a waiter. We had to ask security to go get a waitress two times before they actually came. We’re never approached or anything for drinks. This is ridiculous we waited outside in line and finally  were let in to wait more time to get drinks and food. You guys need better service.

Update the waitress came 5 mins later with an attitude and was basically forcing all the people at our table to get food when we talked about just sharing an appetizer. She got hostile and told us that maybe we should leave because there is other people waiting outside. We all were trying to order drinks and have a good time and she had to make us feel so unappreciated. Please reprimand or get new waitresses because this lady was just rude.</Review>< Resp>

They didn’t let my boyfriend in because he had Jordan’s on but luckily his friend had an extra pair of shoes. It says on the flyer there’s no running shoes allowed but I saw plenty of men wearing Nike’s, Adidas and Under Armour shoes. The body guard was nice enough to let my boyfriend get to the front of the line again but they still didn’t follow dress code when it came to the other guys. DJ wreck wasn’t that good of a DJ but this was also my first time going so idk how the other dj’s are.<//text>

Excellent choices on the menu great variety. If you want a fantastic hamburger this is a perfect choice. It was cooked well without being burnt, high quality beef, wonderful crisp buns on the outside and so fresh on the inside. The fries were crisp and light also. Loved the atmosphere ,very clean , and wonderful service. Very reasonable on prices,   great for family or a date.</Review>

I mean, as far as a regular club it’s fine. There are three rooms with different music and an outdoor area where a band played. No ins and outs. It felt like a total scene to me (not a good thing).<//text>

Tell me why we get there an hour and a half before closing with my bf on a Friday and we were not allowed to get in. I understand the place gets packed but there are people constantly leaving as well. We literally witnessed like 10 people leaving the place right before trying to get in. That was easy money for the business as we intended to also pay for drinks. Ruined the night and the vibe. What a shame as we love the variety of music they play, next time we will go elsewhere.<//Review>

I bought 10 tickets to foam party for my friends Bachelorette Party... on the website and on the tickets said "Foam Party 7:00pm-2:00am".  Some of the girls had to work that night in Grass Valley but we figured we had plenty of time...the girls arrived at 11:30 and we thought we would have at least an hour and a half  to 2 hours of the foam party left.. when we got there we were told the Foam Party ended at 10:30 and if we still wanted in  we would have to wait in line... we complained to someone up front and showed them our tickets and asked if there was something they could do..They said No.. we again said we drove 1 1/2 hrs and have a bachelorette we're trying to show a good time.. they finally let us in .. we danced for an hour and then the lights came on and were told to leave... worst experience EVER!!! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!! They have refused to refund me for the tickets and have not offered anything to make up for it!! I will never go back there!!<//review>

<review>Bartender Jeff raises the occupation of bartender to a whole new level. Not only is there artistry to every drink he creates, but even in a crowd of hundreds, each customer becomes his client, and is treated with the finest hospitality.  Some of the most annoying requests that I have EVER witnessed from any patron, such as "Can you please make 6 shots, two of them diet, but 3 of the other 4 with a triple twist of lemon, lime, and orange--billed on two credit cards?" Bartender Jeff smiled, poured the complicated order, and, despite my sarcastic remarks about the situation, maintained his professionalism, speaking only kind words about his difficult patrons. Truly a class act that will have me coming back again!</review>< Response>

Though they may say chill and casual they allow their two bit rated security guards scrutinize and profile you... Thus allowing the selection process start when you meet the guards who have a say in wether you may enter or not. Overall I have never seen a "public" night club as biased as this one based on looks. Attractive and fun looking on  outside, however on the surface they are the definition of petty and pathetic, a true disappointment, even if you get inside.<//Review>

<text>It's a great place to party. It has a very diverse nightclub with three different dance floors three different sets of music tropical often times top 40 hip hop and Latin music.

Aside from that the restaurant is amazing their menu is full of flavor and creativity. I recently tried there tri-tip salad and the meat is marinated just right along with a pleasant balsamic and a pesto dressing and it compliments a lot of the Latin inspired ingredients.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

If you're looking to ruin your weekend, then look no more in Sacramento downtown other than this nightclub. The bouncers don't know how to behave/being deliberetely disrespectful with their clients. I'll never visit this club again, due to the fact that the bouncers don't want to verify using the cameras what's happened and they lack common sense as they act by people words.<//review>

Wow. I don't understand how they can offer the huge portions for these prices, and at such quality! We very much enjoyed our burgers and will be back for sure. Good service, if a bit inattentive. Cheerful. Gay, even! :D

This place will be loud with more people there, so be prepared for that. Lots of screens in a somewhat cavernous space. Outdoor seating is nice.<//text>

This place has amazing burgers and fries combos for a pretty good value price. The basic hamburger comes vegetables on it with a plate of fries and a pickle and the burger is large enough that they bring out a serrated knife for you to cut it in half with if necessary. Beyond the basic hamburger, they have a pretty good selection of burgers from lamb burgers with feta to buffalo burgers. The staff here are also awesome. Compared to LowBrau, which I still don't understand why they feel the need to charge for their fries when Mangos is across the street, I like the food here more and it's priced better here anyway.< /text>

Absolutely Amazing.

We were a group of 11 total, and started off with three large plates of fries(I cannot remember exactly which). Our party ordered a variety of burgers(a few turkey burgers, classic cheese burgers) and two kids meals(for the WEAK(just kidding)). The burgers were massive, and were cooked to perfection. I mean, it's a burger place and a good one at that.<//Review>

Had the worst experience ever. This place is extremely disrespectful and needs to learn how to hire people with respect.  The manager isn’t any better either...     DONT GO HERE.<//Review>

<Review>We came here to eat which was part of an bar crawl event.   The line was long outside, then you get in another extremely long line to order food.   Finally able to purchase food only to never had recieved it.   When asked about the food the waiter in blue hair said they would check only never to return.   Then when asked for money back they decided to try and figure what went wrong while made to wait even longer.   It was a very terrible and extremely horrible service.   Sad you hold an event and can't even supply the services needed.   First experience was just simply horrid.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1554233587546, 'text': "We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and we're sorry your experience wasn't everything it could've been.

We went to this place based on a Yelp review after our kids finished competing in a rock climbing competition downtown. The service was awesome and the food did not disappoint. We will definitely be back the next time we are in downtown Sacto.<//review>

Terrible. I used to love going to the place. They were closing so they kicked us out after using the restroom and I said I needed my jacket and they said they'd get it and give me a call, yet they never did. I called the assistant manager and the manager and they said they didnt know anything so they were not helpful at all. That day we had VIP seating that jacket meant a lot to me, and they made it seem as if they were going to give it back to me.< /Text>

My girl-friend met this guy, she danced with him, and he was holding her coin purse. All of a sudden, he lost it !!! It was almost closing time, and security gathered to ask, and no help whatsoever. When we started talking about calling the police... miracle !!! The coin purse appeared ! 2 women got next to my friend, holding her coin purse, and pretending they also had lost their's. Good thing she was able to get it back. The drinks are expensive, because the glasses are very small, the cover charge is excessive for the type of place, not upscale at all !!! Don't go there. And beware of the thieves that work there, specially ladies that go after drunk guys, we also witness those thieves !!!< /Review>

< Review>
Witnessed a traumatic  event this weekend.  One of their security guards taking down and kicking a girl! I witnessed what was happening  and this male did not need to do this to her.  I hope this poor girl files a complaint.  Mangos should have security cameras they should review and fire his ass. I will not be going there anymore.  This could have very well been me.

just read the manager's response and I and a group of friends witnessed the situation. What their security did to that poor girl was so uncalled for. We even offered our support to her after witnissing this she was really shocken up. What ever the reason this security used for actions (she might of been drunk, talked back or whatever)  does not make it alright to kick a woman. I'm sorry but I was not drinking that night as I was the sober driver to our party. So I know what happened and she never did try to lay a hand on this a**hola.</Review>

<Review>Fantastic breakfast and coffee spot with really well made food. Honestly one of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had.

I ordered the Traditional Breakfast with eggs over easy, sausage patty, and sourdough toast. I am super impressed with how fresh everything tasted and how well it was prepared.

The eggs were exactly as ordered and held a lot of flavor. The toast was nice and hearty with the perfect amount of butter.  Sausage patty was handcrafted and fairly lean with a really pleasant and light spiced flavor.

I definitely recommend this place for a nice and comforting breakfast. I’ll certainly be back to try out some more of their food. :)</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTe7vI6AmvHhvDt_KJosj3ae5Vm3Fru9rnLOoA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

We stumbled upon this cafe while visiting Long beach. They had good quality brunch food, with a nice neighborhood feel. We ordered the brunch burrito, the egg scramble, and the French toast sticks. The food came out fast and was delicious. The staff was super friendly. I would definitely visit again when I'm in the area.<//review>

<text>MY NEW FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE.   THE FRENCH TOAST IS WITH REAL MAPLE SYRUP.  THE BRAISED GRAPEFRUIT IS SUMPTUOUS.  THE TOP HAS A CRUSTY SUGARED CRUST MADE BY A LITTLE FIRE.  BURSTING WITH GLORIOUS FLAVOR.  THE ENTIRE MEAL WAS 100% great. CANT FORGET THE SERVER WHO STOOD HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE YOUR NORM HER NAME HIS AENNI. SHE WENT OVER AND ABOVE FOR ME. THANK YOU MY NEW FAVORITE.<//text>< pictures>

Live down the street and have tried a few of their breakfast dishes. Their chorizo breakfast burrito is awesome, hits my stomach funny, but a lot of sausages do that lol.

Their breakfast burger? Oooooff the carts good. Thick patty, perfectly seasoned with salt. The peper Aioli pulls all the flavors together. The bun is always perfectly toasted. The strawberry Balsamic jam beautiful brings all the flavors together for a salty,pepper, sweet, and indulgent bite every time!<//review>

<Review>This place is a mix between a Starbucks and a breakfast place. It’s pretty small and mostly a place to grab some food and coffee to chill and study. Their menu is simple bit good! Tried the breakfast sandwich with the biscuit. They are a bit pricey but the portions are good for the price. Their latte art was cute too!<//Review><time>1581050703000</time>< Pictures>

Another great breakfast at a reasonable price. I love to try all the independent coffee shops we have in Long Beach and this one is a favorite. Nicolas is such a great welcoming person that is so helpful and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. The menu has a great variety for a small place. I had the traditional breakfast with the house made sausage patty, scrambled eggs and a huge,savory, homemade biscuit. My husband had the triple berry smoothie which was light and very berry! The drip coffee was good plus you get a free refill! Everything is made from scratch with the freshest ingredients plus the price is reasonable. What I paid for our whole breakfast is what I pay at other trendy coffee shops for one avocado toast and small coffee!! So if you want good, fresh, filling, homemade food, in a great ambiance, try the Steel Cup Cafe!!</Text>

Wow! This place is so yummy! I stopped by just for a coffee, but when I started looking at reviews I HAD to try the food. I ordered a small cappuccino and the beef and bleu sandwich. The staff was very friendly and when they brought the food out the table next to me commented on how "beautiful" the sandwich was. I would never have thought to call a sandwich beautiful, but it was :) everything was delicious.< /Text>

Bad rice bad chicken bad attitudes. I eat at the location up the street almost everyday. The employees at the other location are amazing. The food here was honestly not good. Don’t let this location be your first impression of WaBa. Employees need an attitude check.< /text>

This was my first visit here and I was a bit excited because the general feedback I had was that this was a legit place for Mexican food. I grew up in Texas and being raised on Tex-Mex can leave you unsatisfied when searching for good Mexican food. As a result, I just look for good food, regardless of geography.</review>

Value for money has decreased of late as portion sizes have decreased while prices increase.  Quality control is very good for a chain - you can expect the same quality of food from one establishment to another.</text>

Definitely disappointed and Ive been here 3 different times. The first rime the chicjen was cold and my dish was served about 5 minutes before my friends. The pho broth is extremely salty. When it says a dish comes with veggies it means iceburg lettuce. 3 seperate dishes all disappointing. The people were very nice and the atmosphere was good. Just expected better food.<//text>

This place is awesome if you wanna eat something healthy the waba plate is the best it comes with half beef and chicken and teriyaki sauce which is killer. The cashier gave me good customer service and was really friendly.</text>

<Review>Ugh...tofu only protein worth eating here. Just had there combo chicken and "steak" vegie brown rice bowl...like meat scrappings re-cooked...and I'm not picky at all...eaten there about 6 times but always had the tofu b4.  It's more like smeat than meat...can't go back...might kill me...<//Review><username>Citizen Cane< /username>< Date>

AZ Waba near ASU is stellar. This a great product at that location. Not sure if it was just poor timing in this HB location. Good healthy food though. Try it.<//review>

(Translated by Google) It is a fast food restaurant that does not need reservation. The so-called Teriyaki rice bowl (chicken or cow is the main)
It is good. It is recommended when I miss Japanese food.
If you have chicken, cow, tofu and vegetable mix rice

(Original)
予約不要のファーストフード店です。いわゆる照り焼き丼（鶏か牛がメイン）
うまいです。和食が恋しくなった時にお勧めです。
鶏と牛と豆腐とベジタブルのミックス丼があれば最高</text>

<review>Pulled up and the hoped to work. 3 guys on my car, looking like they were knocking it out pretty quickly. About 20-30 minutes.  They showed me the oil dipstick’s handle was broken and the carbon filter for the AC is completely clogged. Good to know, and actually explains our issue with the AC seemingly not working when it should be good.</review>< username>

Been going to Sal for a few years now and even with different cars he's always taken care of me. I also appreciate how he really is upfront about the other work that is needed. Another plus is the friendly staff even when I just pass by getting gas Sal always greets me. I really recommend this place</Text>

I've been going to Sal's for about a year now & I recently had some work done there and a friend told me I probably needed brakes based on my mileage so when I went to Sal's I expected to hear exactly that.  I talked to Sal personally and told him I was concerned about my brakes.  After my oil change & etc. Sal told me he personally checked out my brakes and they were in great condition, the front are almost like new and the backs are about 50% worn.  Talk about honesty, he knew I was expecting to have to pay for new brakes and he very easily could have lied and made a few bucks but he didn't.  I've also heard similar stories from friends and people I've talked to about how honest he is.  I won't go anywhere else, his honesty in this day & age is a rare thing and it's make a life-long customer out of me.<//text>

I don't know. Something... fishy. I'm still looking at my receipt and sticker and mileage for next service. First time here. People are nice, but I'll go back to my regular spot next time... I wonder if they used synthetic oil for reals.</Review>

Engine light came on my 07, Suburban. Sal said there were 3 misfires in the engine. His mechanic Edgar replaced the coils, plugs and injectors.  $2800.00 job. Took the truck home and ran even worse. With the engine light still on. Took it back and Edgar charged me $360.00. Said it was a short.  Still ran badly and engine light on. Edgar said I needed a new engine.  Took it to a reputable shop and they found the problem immediately.  Original job was shoddy. Injector wires were crossed. Either Sal's mechanics are inept or they are thieves. No response from Sal about what he intends to do about his mechanics.<//text>

I came to the place with my kids looking to do a buff for my truck ask the owner how long would it take he said two hours so I took my kids to a restaurant up the street for about 2 hours when I came back they were nearly putting my truck through washer. Then when I asked owner I thought he said it will only be two hours and said they’re working it.. I would never go back there again and I don’t recommend any of you do.< /text>

I'm surprised on how many bad reviews are here. This place is a nice car wash!  They cleaned the car nicely, and the cashier inside the store was very kind. I recommend to go here if you want your car to be thoroughly washed!</Text>

This place takes time to do the job right the FIRST TIME and anything worth having is worth waiting for! Not to mention they clean the inside and outside for you! I love this place!!
Some folks like to mention time and I agree, there is nothing worse than wasting your time AND money on the Speed Wash places here in the desert that leave large places untouched!. When I complain I get to wait in another 8 to 10 car line for another wash in the same visit that misses the same places. Time and money wasted to clean 80% of each of my cars.

I'm done with the lousy automated places.</text>

Takes a long time, they don't use the wash machine it's entirely by hand which might be good if you have sensitive paint. Vacuum job was rough but the outbound guy took care of it. I'd come back only if I had lots of time and drove a dark painted car<//Review>

This place is terrible had my mom's car for over four hours and her carpet was  super wet and the car very dirty. Also it was very expensive 100$$ we were very disappointed and was not worth the money And they were very rude too. We do NOT recommend this place you will get better results if you do it yourself. Don't waste your money here. I had to put a star so k could comment but in all reality they don't even deserve one.< /Text>

<Review>HORRIBLE Rip Off!  Enployees are lazy and insulting.  I went to this car wash today.  The basic wash no longer includes wiping out the interior.  It's $5 to add that service.  I was willing to pay that even though I thought it was too high... But, the man working told me because my car was extra dirty it would be $50 -the price of a mini detail.  So I told him I only want to wash the outside, vacuum, and wipe off the dash and center console. He said it would be $40. RIDICULOUS! I drive a regular size car. So,  I left and went to speed wash for a $6 wash, vacuumed myself (it took about 10 minutes). Went into wal Mart and bought a $4 bottle of dash cleaner, spent another 3 minutes. Car is clean for $10!<//Review>< Pics>

They don't do the best job of wiping down the inside of your vehicle. I actually had to ask them to clean the arm rest even though I paid for the $30 wash. Did ownership change hands? All the sudden the workers look like ex-cons & some bad elements are hanging around the property. Probably not going to help bring in the business when customers see that kind of stuff.<//Text>

<review>Great place for a car wash. It was my first time last saturday and am very pleased with the service given at this place. It was really 100% hand wash !! I stopped there on my way to vegas and this place was so much better than the place I used to go in orange county. This place is best for the people like me who do not want their car to be damaged by using cheap car wash machine located in gas station. The price was affordable and the service was awesome. The owner takes good care of the entire car wash process so you dont have to worry about any car damage. :) I highly recommend~~</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1593585301385, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, as of now the business is under new management and has underwent serious renovations from the building, employees, maintenance, entertainment, and so much more!

Both of our cars had LOTS of trash in it and they cleaned both cars out and didn't charge anything. I am going to go home and bring my dirty ass lifted truck to be wash. That's how awesome of a service they provided.
Someone complained about $5 to be charged to clean the inside. NONSENSE. You pay more at this carwash then you do at a $5-6 carwash is because you do all the work instead of the guys. Duh. Time is money and money is time.</Text>< rating>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Starbucks is one of those coffee shops that mirrors all their other locations, and I guess some are a little different. But you can still depend on the same coffee all the time. We frequent a lot of the Starbucks in our area and they have always had a good cup of coffee. The outside sitting area could use a little updating but other than that the store looked great. The employees at this location were nice and courteous and as always, we will be back again.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSNm5SAIoQazMFuj7noGiW40MVfHYRLUxG7Nsh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoEXqe7hty6ocCwic1KAPFaM7Ulc2_25s4pShj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTSTuGjSXNkCto5tgB_EUxD2aT_LfJEyRpuRIY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMwhaxajmN9LdVCTPwlrGSOmi3aRDDxwZQjr-_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjC4wnJLBvnD-HpkJUyETA-n6WnI8MADnLZTWL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

The manager was extremely nice and helpful. She even recognized me from another location nearly 4 years ago. I will definitely be back.</Review>

<text>Moderately sized Starbucks. Separate building in a shopping area. Has the usual Starbucks menu.

Traffic in the neighborhood can be dense. The plaza lot is large and there is plenty of parking around the Starbucks.

The staff has always been fast and friendly with my orders.<//text>< Time>

I hope the chairs for the counter by the window are a little shorter. My back hurt after 10 minutes spending in front of my laptop because of it.</Review>< Date>

Who doesn't love Starbucks? They are there when you need them and provide a place to meet up with others. What more could you want?</Review>

<review>Never in my life have I gone out of my way to write a review for a company but after ordering a sandwich and the employees of this restaurant failing to complete such a simple task, I couldn’t resist. It’s literally one of the easiest jobs in the world. To make a sandwich. The lack of education clearly shows for the employees. They are unable to do the simplest tasks and when they mess up, they give you attitude and clearly make you feel unwelcome. Hire some people a little more educated. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE A DAMN SANDWICH!</review><Time>1623623762190< /Time>< gmapID>

<Review>The service was fast and our sandwiches were good. The staff working when we came, in were really nice. The location was perfect since we were already out visiting ghost town and wanted to grab chow without going further out toward 15 or heading straight back to the base.</Review><Response>None</Response>< Rate>

<rating>2< /rating><text>This is food you eat when real food is not available. Seriously like I go here when I want something that's walking distance from my house, or I'm in a real hurry, or it's 3 in the morning and nothing else is open except for that creepy Jack in the box. Subway's big advantage used to be that it was cheap. You knew you weren't getting a really great sandwich. you knew that they were sitting there counting individual slices of lettuce and everything was measured out ridiculously but for $5 it was a quick cheap meal. Unfortunately that's same $5 sandwiches now $8. Honestly unless you're desperate, you're better off going to someplace like Jersey Mike's.< /text>< pictures>

A really nice place to stay. We reserved a chalet with a full kitchen. It had a dining area, a living room with fireplace and a separate bedroom area with a king sized bed. The kitchen comes with basic dinnerware, pans, utensils. The view from the back patio was beautiful. The room was clean and well maintained.</Review>

This resort was absolutely amazing! The cabins are gorgeous and so is the outside view! I was highly impressed that it all looked even better than the pictures show! I had an amazing stay with my partner. We loved how quiet and private the cabin was. Will definitely be staying again soon!!!!</Review>

We thought that it would have been nice to stay for at least 4 nights. We were really close to all the hiking in the area that we had in mind to do. Loved the wood setting and seeing the mountain. The pull out couch bed was awful. So we pulled the mattress out and slept on the floor. Put it back in the morning. Next time we stay Ill bring my own pans to cook in. Theirs were to small for our group.  The place was quiet and good sized.<//review><username>Hotels.com reviewer<//username>< user>

I had a lovely two night stay! I did stay during a quieter time, and I can see how it could be a little more roudy during busier times, but it was perfect for me. There are trails around the lake that you can walk to directly from the cabins and it's gorgeous. Restaurant was closed because of COVID, so I can't speak to that piece. The one CON that I do see, is paying a resort fee - with the restaurant closed, and not partaking in golf or tennis, I didn't see the point of the extra charge. Would rather have that lumped into the cost or optional if you want to use the facilities.</Review>

<Text>The outside of the cabin led us to believe the inside would be cozy/rustic.  It was not.  I felt like I was staying at my Aunt's house in her guest room, stuck in the 90's.  Poor lighting, mauve/beige paint throughout and dated artwork.  Just unkempt and not what I expected given the ratings. No porch/deck to relax outside to listen to the birds. Also the alarm clock went off while we were deep asleep at 10pm.  Terrible nights sleep and we got out of there as soon as possible the next morning.</Text><user>None<//user>< Pictures>

It’s a gorgeous facility right on lake siskiyou. My Shasta city is close by and has plenty of places to eat. Even with covid I was surprised at how many places were still open for takeout. The town also has cute shops and the scenery is stunning all around.</text>

Very nice location that is very scenic and convenient to the lake and hiking.   Nice room, though dated.Could not sleep one night of our stay due to a large crowd of people yelling, laughing, and sledding down a hill right next to our room from 9 PM past midnight.  Front desk was unavailable to help as they leave after 8 PM. Was told only maintenance emergencies are addressed after this time.  There was no charcoal, matches, or bbq tools provided for the unclean, inconvenient, and shared, charcoal grill that was available.  A gas grill on the deck would have been nice. No dishwasher, and kitchen utensils are bare bones.</review>

This is the prettiest golf course! It has spectacular views. My Dad and uncle have been golfing this course for many years. It is their favorite course! My Dad last golf this course July 2014. My uncle just golfed it this July. My sister & I came to the course this summer to remember our Dad who passed January 2017. We had the golf pro take us around the course. He allowed us to have time to remember our Dad and take photos throughout the course. It was a little emotional but a very good outing.  Thank you to the very friendly staff. We appreciate you! I highly recommend this course for golfing!< /Review>

Nice, clean, spacious and private chalet with fascinating surroundings in the middle of the mountain next to the lake. very nice hike trail nearby, definitely a must.The park space is a bit limited and the AC is a bit annoying. make sure to leave from the main door as leaving from the back door will creat a double lock on the main door and you won’t be able to open it with the key card. This happened to us and was abit annoying, I would definitely recommend the resort to change the locks and keys mechanism. Would highly recommend you to go to Pipleline for dinner 👌</text>

We had a great time here and it was a beautiful time of year.  So just a few things I would note if your considering a stay.   One, the lake view is nice but it’s not really possible to walk from your chalet right to the lake, because the slope is so steep.   You can take a little stroll to wagon creek bridge and other parts of the lake.  It’s really nice.  As other people noted the furniture is very dated.  Kind of feels like your using your grandparents cabin, but it does give it a cozy feel.  Something more modern may appeal to younger couples but if your a little older or have a family with ya it’s probably not going to bother you at all.  If anything it may help you feel a little more comfortable.  With that said, man our bed was broken in and just needed to be replaced. So if you get chalet 143, sleep in the smaller of the two rooms.  The kitchen was well equipped but we were a little confused on where to throw away trash once it got full and there were no steak knives, which would of been nice because this place just screams steak dinner.   Lastly, the internet was surprisingly decent. I unfortunately had to do some work and was able to download some large files and hosted a few zoom meetings with no issues at all. Overall, We really enjoyed our stay and will probably be back.<//text>

< Review>
I think that calling it a Resort is rather inappropriate, as it is a collection of rather dated cabins.  I wouldn't call it a dump, but on a scale of dump--resort, I would classify it closer to a dump. Front desk service is not something that makes you feel welcome, and "resort" fee is something to get more money out of travelers for absolutely nothing extra in services.</Review>

<text>This place was amazing. We had a chalet which came with a full kitchen, living room, and separate bedroom. Prices are very reasonable. We truly enjoyed the fireplace. The entire area was quiet and serene. We enjoyed the trail around lake siskiyou. They have a Spa at the resort where you can get several different massages and other services. We got the couples massage. It was incredible. The entire staff was outstanding. The only thing I can mark down on is our chalet needed new electrical outlets and maybe a new shower head. All and all this place is awesome and we will be back soon.<//text>< Gmap_id>

We love the friendly staff. The chalets were enormous and easily fit our party of four. They were clean and the beds were great. We had a very restful sleep. The amenities of dishes, refrigerator, along with cooking utensils helped save our budget on food. We would definitely recommend this place to anybody. Our family had a great time. We plan to return in the future and would like to make this a regular destination for us. There there are a lot of summertime and wintertime activities. They're in-house grill and bar was excellent with great food choices and an awesome bartender.</Review>

We really enjoyed our stay here. The chalets are warm and charming. My only suggestion would be that a little "updating," of the living area furnishings and kitchen should be in their future plans.  Will definitely be back!<//text>

I really liked that the property was nestled in the trees and backed up to Lake Siskiyou, with beautiful nature trails right out our back door.  It was very serene, and felt more remote than it was. It was well-stocked with everything we needed (except a bathtub.) We were there off-season, during the week and part of the weekend, which was good for both the quiet and our budget. It will probably be much more crowded during high season, but then again, so will all the other places in the area. I would come back here anytime.< /review>

<Review>Nice place to stay. But they need help on customer service, being welcoming and friendly to their guest. That was a big disappointment really.
Other than that, it's a beautiful wooded quiet place. We enjoy that it's a great dog friendly resort.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Actually haven't been there. Passed on Amtrak in early morning - breakfast time. Beautiful morning with some high clouds and lots of sun. Snow wrapping the summit with lenticular cloud cap on top. Very scenic area with forests, rocky crags, volcanic remnants, lakes, streams, and high desert landscapes. Go there.</Text>

The accommodations were good. Large room in remote area along Lake Siskiyou. You could hear anytime the nextdoor unit turned on the water.The downside was hearing the train horn at 1:30am, 2am, 5am and 7am.</text>

< review>
In the spirit of full disclosure, I have not  stayed at the resort hotel as a guest and have not yet played a round of golf. I have attended several meetings, dined there, and visited the pro shop a couple of times. As for first impressions, the building and features appear tired and a little dated, in need of freshening up. Every time I enter the lobby, I appreciate being welcomed by the front desk staff. The pro shop staff are also friendly and helpful as well. Otherwise, my experience with the restaurant and banquet staff has been luke-warm. It is as though they have lost a spark of enthusiasm in working with guests. Based on my experience as a business consultant for many years, I've found this general malaise tends to stem from something amiss in senior management. Also, the food is middle of the road. The quality is okay, in a Sysco kind of way, but lacks that memorable dining experience a resort should exude. I'm not going to speculate the underlying cause of these issues, but a place like the Mt Shasta Resort is critical on so many levels to our local community and economy. The overall guest experience should be more of a top priority than it currently appears to be. Three stars feels a bit of a harsh judgement, but I struggle with providing a four star rating because of my comments above.< /review>

Awesome rooms for the price. The chalet's have a fireplace, porch, and a full kitchen. They are basically a small apartment! Lovely atmosphere among nature. The restaurant is about a half a mile from where the rooms are and has good food. Enjoyed our stay thoroughly.</review>

Rebecca and the staff were all professional, friendly, and knowledgeable, and more than met our expectations for my daughter's wedding this past weekend.  The chef is exceptional and every meal we ate was a delicious treat. We enjoyed the chalet with it's comfy bed, Jacuzzi tub, and view of Lake Siskiyou out the back door. I would highly recommend the Resort as a wedding venue or vacation spot.  And, you have to see it for yourself, as Mt. Shasta is a stunning backdrop during every season.< /text>

There for a wedding, which was very well done. Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was clean and nice, though it would be nice if there was just a little more walking space for the parking spots in the chalets with three rooms. Especially when attending an event in heels! Overall great experience!< /Review>

Cabin are amazingly spacious, nice, & modern. Prices are good for a week stay. Need to drive to the main resort, but that is good...since here it is very serene.</Review>< pictures>

Lovely area for avid outdoors people. Our room felt like a manufactured home that was converted to have 3 rooms. They were comfortable but a bit old. Restaurant served good food, a bit on the pricey side. Staff was pleasant and helpful.</Review>

They hadnt received anything about my reservation from Orbitz.  I had my confirmation from Orbitz, however.The hotel graciously upgraded us to a lovely chalet at the same price as our double queen room.  We are very happy with the hotel, but not so much with Orbitz.< /Text>

Best value for a resort with attached spa. The view is breathtaking. Great place to relax, romance, and get sombre fresh air.<//Text>

We asked for the direction from the highway 5 by calling them. It turned out to be that we have to go other side of the city and not just taking 2 left turns and 3 miles as the lady told us over the phone. It was 10 o'clock in night and we found our self lost +  there are no lights on inside roads including very little lighting around resort area. One could easily miss it. There was no sign of welcoming or smile. We asked if we could check out at noon instead specially checking in this late. The housekeeping lady knocked our door sharp at 11:00 pm saying someone needs to check in early and room needed cleaning. We were shocked with the their lack of accommodation and treating customers differently.<//Review>

I reached the place well into the night around 2 am. They had arranged for me to get to my room in the snow to perfection. I'd recommend this place for a stay even though we were there for a overnight pitstop.</review>

The rooms are immaculate. The professionalism and overall willingness to provide the best care by the staff is absolutely impeccable. The restaurant had 5 star food and service. I recommend staying here for anyone coming to the Mt. Shasta area.</review>

Just spent our 22nd Anniversary at Mt Shasta Resort and i must say it's the first time my husband and I left a getaway with bad memories.   We didn't get checked in until 5:15, tired and hungry as we were planning on a nice romantic dinner. Had to change dinner reservations 3 times to accommodate their checking us in late..."room not ready"..chek in time is 4pm. Staff kept sending us  upstairs for drinks to wait. Manager left knowing this. Had 15 minutes to sit in front of lake and toast to our Anniversary...holding it all together emotionally. Then rushed to get ready for dinner. Our 1st anniversary dinner that wasn't romantic due to the way we were treated. It ruined our Anniversary. The bad thing about this besides our bad memories is that we got a gift card from our daughter for a getaway here for Christmas and decided to use it for our special day and I had to tell her. It was a nightmare. Food, waiter and bartender was great....stay was short and sour. Will NEVER go there again. Dang...its still on my mind. I blame this all on the manager...shame on you.<//Review>

Great drinks at the bar/restaurant. Decent food but expensive. Great outdoor seating area on sunny days, overlooking the golf course.</Text>

We were overcharged for a hotel stay that never happened and were not given the courtesy of having it resolved.    Most hotels charge a cancellation policy and we can understand that--however to charge $* or a two night stay that never happened and have to resort to resolving the problem via a credit card company is very disappointing for a hotel that bills itself as luxurious and friendly.   In this economy, to not be willing to understand personal circumstances and meet a customer half-way is un-business-like and greedy.</Text>

<Review>You'd be better off going to McCloud or Shastina. Service and policies here suck. More policing going on than golf.  It is very sad; I learned to play golf here and was a member for ten years. My recent experience with Dee & Susan, the general manager has ruined the game of golf for me. I have not played since.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Restaurant has friendly staff but quality isn't super impressive.</text>

< Review>
Used to be our go to place when up at Shasta area. Though now during covid-19 they're charging $300 a night for a room in the off season! Not worth it. I do want to give my business to them but just too expensive. I just ended up booking an Airbnb about 5 miles away for $150 less for two nights. You should do the same especially when the restaurant staff, except Danae, are mostly surly.< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Mount Shasta is located in the Cascade range in Northern California. The incredible mountain Shasta grows around the picturesque mountains in Siskiyou District at 4322 meters above sea level. It is also one of the largest inactive volcanoes, a legendary and mysterious place known in history.

(Original)
Núi Shasta nằm trong dãy Cascade ở miền Bắc California. Ngọn núi lạ thường Shasta mọc lên quanh những ngọn núi đẹp như tranh vẽ ở Quận Siskiyou ở độ cao hơn 4322 mét so với mực nước biển. Nó cũng là một ngọn núi lửa ngưng hoạt động lớn nhất, một nơi huyền thoại và bí ẩn từng được biết đến trong lịch sử.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I had a fantastic couch buying experience at Plush. After months of unsuccessful shopping both online and in stores I was finally able to get exactly what I wanted. Jeanine was extremely kind and patient with me throughout the whole process, and she helped me fully customize a couch to my exact specifications. After my wonderful new couch was delivered and installed, I realized I chose the wrong color legs and again, Jeanine was completely helpful and unbothered by my mistake and ordered another set in for me, which arrived very quickly. I highly recommend going to see Jeanine!</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>Came in to Plush Home Furniture & Mattress on my lunch break today, and in less than 30 minutes I managed to find a mattress, headboard and bed frame that I love. The full set is being delivered to my house tomorrow. The staff are friendly and helpful. They also made sure I walked away feeling like I got a deal! Would definitely go back again if I have other furniture needs while living in SLO.< /text><rating>5</rating></record>

I went to Plush to see what types of couches and love seats they had in search of a white or off white love seat.  I was pleasantly surprised by the large selection of great looking choices.  Jeanine (one of the owners) helped my friend and I and gave us some great suggestions.  She was very friendly and helpful.  It was my first stop so I wanted to shop around and make sure it was "the one".  After visiting quite a few more it was clear that Plush had what I wanted.  I went back and paid for it and arranged for delivery which was not only very reasonable they were easily able to accommodate my schedule with the delivery.   Her husband and another person came and brought it to the right spot, put the legs on and took away all the packing material.  My love seat is not only cute but well made and the fabric is the new Revolution so its basically indestructible.</Review>

<review>I purchased many furniture pieces here in May 2017, and they have all held up like a dream. My couches look clean and plush (despite 3 kids and a cat), the bed frame is in perfect condition, and the mattress is still good as new. Shopping there was a great experience, as well. You won’t regret shopping here!<//review>< Pics>

<review>I purchased a dresser and 5 nightstands from Plush. Jeanine and Maria were great. I had a difficult time finding the right antique white and they couldn't have been more patient and understanding. Their communication as we searched different potential vendors was outstanding. They made two deliveries to my house and they were timely and extremely professional. Their quality furniture and reasonable prices are another big reason to shop with them. I highly recommend Plush!</review>< pictures>

Went couch shopping around SLO last Saturday and found a great sectional that met all of our needs at Plush.

Very quick and easy process overall with Jeanine, we were in and out in about 20 minutes. The standard delivery day was set to be Monday but Jeanine and Bob were very flexible and were able to squeeze us in for delivery THAT SAME DAY!

Bob arrived right on time at 7pm that evening and hustled our massive couch into place within 5 minutes. He explained how to install the feet and hook together the two pieces (very easy 5 minutes) and was off!

Couldn't have been happier with my first new couch purchasing experience, will definitely be returning for other furniture.<//review>

I love my new couch and it was very reasonably priced for a custom order (fabric, arm hight, piping, button pillows, soft cushions, you name it, we picked it).

The staff is super nice. They have a good selection, from classic traditional to fun statements. You can buy what's on the floor or make a custom order. The sales people aren't pushy at all and take the time to walk you through all the options and what you might want to consider.

Also, if your looking for something in particular, they can probably find it in their catalogues and order it for you.< /Text>

<Review>My girlfriend and I were in the market for a new couch. We made a decision to get a couch and sofa combo which the staff was incredibly helpful in purchasing. Long story short we ended up doing an exchange for another floor model. The staff was friendly and very helpful the entire time. The men who delivered the couch were fast, careful, and respectful to our home. I highly recommend this store to anyone who is looking for either a mattress or furniture and are intimidated by the options. The staff will work with you and help you all along the way. We plan on returning to this store in the future.<//Review><user_id>110544770301736524079<//user_id><name>Kevin Conner</name>< pictures>

I recently purchased an Ibed Platinum mattress set from Plush Home Furniture and realized it is the best purchase I have ever made and now I can hardly get out of bed and to work on time because it is too comfortable!  Bob and Jeanine were AMAZING to work with.  They found the perfect bed for my bod to help eliminate all my aches and pains.  I will never buy a mattress anywhere else other than going to Plush Home Furniture!</review>

In looking for a small convertible loveseat , I was surprised to find one in the showroom here. No one else in town had any available. Although we ended up ordering a different one, we had GREAT service from Jeanine. She listened to us and found us exactly what we needed. Since it was on backorder, she kindly threw in a gift. The loveseat showed up and it looks and feels even better in person! We will definitely return for our future furniture needs!!< /text>

What an awesome store!  After looking everywhere for a sofa I needed quickly,  my friend and I found Plush Home Furniture and we were amazed at the genuine care they give to their customers!  Their selection, pricing, quality and designs were outstanding! The owners go above and beyond to assist but with no high end pressure. Thank you Plush for doing customer service the way it's suppose to be done,  with genuine kindness,  knowledge and integrity. I would be happy to refer you to family and friends and I will gladly return for any future needs.
Your customer in Morro Bay<//Text>

Super friendly staff and really great prices, highly recommend for college students looking for cheap mattresses. I had to buy a mattress for my new house for college and I went to every mattress store in the nearby area and they had the best prices and the friendliest staff out of all the stores I went to. Also the guy who delivers the mattresses was supposed to just deliver the mattress but he also set it up free of charge.< /Text>

<review>One stop shop here in SLO!  Just moved into our new beach home and was ready to make a trek down to Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, but thought I should just make a quick stop at the "little store in SLO".  I was so surprised to see that PLUSH had EVERYTHING I needed, and I didn’t have to take the drive down to Santa Barbara’s furniture stores after all! ——> in one hour, I was able to find everything I was looking for:  A beautiful mid-century modern sofa for the living room, a comfy daybed for the corner window, a modern outdoor sectional (for the small space I was sure was going to be a tough one to find)!! The awesome floor lamp was perfect for my space, I even found the perfect colorful swivel chair for the living room to add the pop I needed! And it was all amazingly priced, comfortable and great quality.  Jeanine, the owner is so warm and helpful and she has impeccable taste!  Her husband, Bob, and Alfonzo delivered the furniture and set it up beautifully in seconds!  This is the kind of service that is really hard to find these days!!!  Anyways, fast forward 6 weeks later, I'm ready to furnish the "mancave" and after looking for some good deals on the internet, I went  back to Plush to see what they might have.  This time, Jeanine was out of town, but Maria was there to help me, and again wonderful warm service and they had the PERFECT mancave comfy couch (with storage on one side and opens to a fold out bed) and 2 perfectly sized quality leather recliners!  We just watched our first movie with some friends last night and we were all commenting on how comfortable all the seating was! My husband and 12 yr old son, just gave me an "A+". Ha!  ~I never write reviews, but felt that I needed to thank Plush with a  sincere review. (-was hoping to upload some pics, but I am terrible at this stuff and am not able to figure out how to upload the photos to my review.  I am going to text the photos directly to Jeanine, so that she might be able to tag it to my review.). Anyone looking for ANY furniture, Go check PLUSH out. They will not disappoint.!!  Thank you everyone at Plush. I'll be back! ~Sincerely, Jillian<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I went to buy a mattress and I found very good quality and service from Jeanine and Maria gave me information about the product and they don't force you to buy any mattress they give you your time and you decide.
Excellent furniture highly recommended.
Congrats

Wow! I went to the acute care a couple weeks ago and I was very happy with their medical assistant Evelyn! She was on top of it and they were busy! She didn’t take any short cuts, listened to me, and helped in every way she could. I will be going back just because of her.< /review>

She has disgusting bedside manner. She treated my mother as if she were lying about being scared of doctors resulting in a higher blood pressure reading. Dr. Katherine Lee directly told her in a smug attitude "I do not believe in that white coat syndrome." Then she goes on to bash my mothers medical concerns and her last doctors integrity with her holier-than-thou attitude. She even had the audacity to belittle our people and county's name by complaining how "(she) can not understand how people in this town think." If she is so disgusted in our town then go somewhere else! After the appointment my mother sat in her car crying while my father tried to calm her. My mother, the rest of my family, and our friends will never use her medical services ever again. Once again I am thoroughly disgusted with her "professionalism." I highly advise no one to use her services.< /Text>< pics>

You could wait 6 hrs at the hospital OR 20-30 min at Lassen Medical for the same thing..  I recommend Lassen to anyone that has a non life threatening injury and just needs quick care..

Half of his class had been out for influenza over the past week (in Oregon) but when we mentioned that to the physician we were dismissed and sent for an appendicitis scan at the Emergency Department.

The ED quickly gave us a flu test, which was positive, and got anti-nausea medicine on board, which stopped the 20-minute vomit cycle  (about four hours after our visit to Lassen).

Subsequently, we ended up with two medical bills instead of one, and were thoroughly dismissed when we registered our dismay and concerns with Lassen.  No apologies, no amends.

I have never before been so disappointed as to feel I needed to post about it.</review>< gmapID>

Very dissapointing front desk personnel, they tell you one thing on the phone than when you show up they tell you they made a mistake and that you have to wait for a 5 hour window or come back another day. I don't understand how they think a child can wait in the lobby 5 hours. They tell you it's because we are behind, maybe if instead of being on their cell phone and actually paying attention they would not fall behind, so much.< /Text>

Seems as if they are always in a state of being trained and employee turnover makes it impossible to feel comfortable with the answers you receive either on the phone or in office.

Doctors Fish and Villapena have given me excellent care. Nurses are above average. Patty in work comp is the bomb!

Doctor turnover has been an issue for some of my family members, which left them dealing with a different on call doctor every time they needed to be seen or have their prescriptions refilled. Hard to get anything accomplished.<//Review>< Pics>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>My son's appointment was scheduled far out because there were no sooner appointments. My kids' school is 30 minutes away. I kept him home from school for it, but still took his sister to school on time before the appointment. After waiting in line for a long time, I was told they wouldn't see us because we were 8 minutes late and they won't see you after 5 minutes. I explained we'd been waiting in the line and the receptionist just repeated we were more than 5 minutes late. I'm incredibly fed up with patient's time being much less important then clinicians. It's ridiculous. Having to come 20 minutes early to an appointment to make sure you have time to stand in their line then wait 20+ minutes after your appointment time to be taken back and then 20 more minutes for the clinician to come in is completely unacceptable. Now I'll drive an extra hour and my son missed school for nothing. Clients deserve better treatment and consideration.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Mark W.'}< /Response><review>I love my doctor and had been very satisfied with all aspects of service until Dignity Health purchased the group.
I've had to call multiple times to ensure referrals were completed and to ensure services were requested from my insurance. It even required my arrival at the office before a number of things were done. The phone service is deplorable and it's almost as if they hope their patients just leave for another doctor.
I've started my search for another doctor and I'm very sad to do so as I am still satisfied with the medical care but not what it takes to complete anything else.

Edit in response to Mark:
Thank you for your response Mark. While I believe in most cases calling to report such awful and disrespectful service would be appropriate, the phone service is part of how miserable your business is. After three minutes on hold (I've timed it), the caller is directed to leave a name and number in order to receive a call back. I've done that Mark. I've done that a few times. Would you like to guess how many return calls I've received? Take a guess Mark. The answer is ZERO.... Nada... Zip...ZILCH...a whole lotta nothing Mark. After 10 minutes (maybe 15) of being on hold you just get hung up on. It really sends the message of how important the patients are.
What's so troubling for me is my doctor has been excellent. He has referred me to specialists at UCSF after attending conferences there on the topic of my own diagnosis. He cares. He seeks out the best and most accurate answers to whatever I'm dealing with. I'm sorry that I want to leave. I'm sorry that he is effected because of such an incompetent corporation. I mean, I'm a cash cow for a money-hungry business such as your own Mark. Suffice it to say that I'm a physical mess and I have insurance so I'm a golden goose for the billing dept. While I do not believe money should be the focus nor the reason for respecting ones clients, I'm also a realist and understand DHC is a business and losing patients is just plain bad for it.
You (DHC) need to do better. I understand that there isn't much competition and you have the luxury of sitting back and watching reluctant patients walk through your door because they have no other choice, but I really do hope that somewhere in the upper echelon of offices making decisions, the idea of actually treating clients with respect and prompt care becomes important to someone.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I'm re-rating simply because it seems to have gotten better. *5 Stars for their Pediatrics area as well as *5 Stars* for walk-in experience: I went to the walk-in, was seen in a timely fashion given you've no appointment. Would be silly to be seen right away without one. Wasn't in the room that long before the Dr. came in to see me. Staff was very polite. Each portion of this place seem to have a different feeling to it because in the Internal Medicine area it's a hit or miss with the staff, but I do enjoy my Dr., she is kind. Only issue I have is the problem I'm dealing with it doesn't seem she knows what's going on since labs show nothing. And for a bit of back story so people aren't like "Well if the labs say no then it's no." I barely eat and may eat something sweet or takeout a couple times a year if that, I don't drink nor smoke and I'm active, but I've gained over 60lbs in less then 5months.  So something is wrong!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

My mother was treated as if she was a hypochondriac by Dr. Ahmadpour. He spoke to her in a way that was quite offensive and belittled her and refused to listen and accept anything she said! When asked to be reassigned to another physician,  we were told there weren't any accepting new patients.  After many failed attempts to get this "Dr." to listen,  we went elsewhere for her care. Long and painful story later... she has lung cancer!!!!! So, I would like to thank this facility for the negligence and utter disregard for my mother and the complete lack of care that may well have cost her her life.< /review>

< Review>
My children have had the same pediatrician now going on 18 years. I have now been informed that some of my kids are under different doctors. This occurred because I scheduled with different providers for a 1 time yearly physical. The provider was booked out over 2 months and I was asked by the receptionist if I wanted them to check availability with another. NEVER was I told this type of visit automatically switches the primary physician on record. Beware folks, I am beyond irritated by this along with so many other changes with Lassen Medical. Then today I am told I have to be present with my 17 year old for a standard follow up. Mind you my younger son has also unexpectedly been brought in to urgent care for xrays after a nasty fall. I cant be with both so I asked that she see the provider alone as she has the last 3 appointments. They said this isnt possible and they were rude and couldnt accurately answer my questions...if this is the case WHY was she seen 2 days ago and 3 weeks ago alone? The only answer they had as to why she can be seen alone under law of her privavy is gynecologic visits. Again I want answers because her last 2 appointments had nothing to do with that. As a matter of fact they gave her a vaccine that I had specifically declined on our last visit together and I didn't need to be present or authorize this? I ended the visit with no real answers and an upset daughter because during my breaks to run and check on my other child the office staff was loudly voicing their irritation by the mom who doesnt know anything as they put it along with other distasteful remarks. To say I'm irritated is minor. I'm furious and very disappointed in the changes to Lassen Medical. They have become rude, unreliable, and completely unprofessional.<//Review>

My husband and I are both patients of Dr. Minky Saini and we have been so amazed at how much care and time she takes to listen! She gives us intelligent and well thought out advice, recommendations or whatever is needed in our particular situation. Dr. Saini is so easy to talk to and Nora her nurse is wonderful, professional and very friendly! We have not had a problem at all with their staff and the reception at area has always been polite and addressed us with a smile and friendly atmosphere! Nora has also been great at returning calls or following through with feed back from Dr. and pharmacy info! Thank you all again we are lucky to have you in our town.</Review>

Completely unacceptable. I should add that most other aspects of their care is acceptable, but this needs to be fixed. The only way  to ensure I get this filled is to physically visit their location and make the request, I guess. Horrible.

<Text>Still takes a bit of time to get seen at the clinic side. With paper work you have to fill out everytime you go in.
Otherwise it is still better than the emergency room at the hospital for non emergency reasons. Also, since they are officially owned by the hospital it is all inter connected.< /Text>< Time>

<text>You can never get a hold of this place.  Husband had some serious health problems, Dr. wanted to see him in 2 weeks after he had more lab tests.  Receptionist scheduled him for 6 weeks later, after we explained the doctors 2 week time request.  Now they have rescheduled the appointment twice and if the next scheduled appointment is not rescheduled it will be nearly 3 months to get a “2 week” appointment.  I took him 4 months to get a appointment for his annual physical prior to this incident. This is ridiculous.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

<Text>Awful. You have to wait 30 minutes just to talk to someone because the office is so understaffed. The doctor turnaround is completely ridiculous. They are also under staffed on doctors.  It takes 30 days to get an appointment if you need to see a doctor because you are ill they tell you to go to the walk in clinic that is a minimum of an hour and a half wait (likely much more.) You are also waiting when you have an appointment in the waiting room for at least an hour before you get seated in  a room. I can't tell you how many times I had issues that should have never even occurred. Nobody seemed to be capable of even providing me immunization records for my daughter. The doctors they do have are inexperienced often. My newborn son's first pediatrician tried to pump it full of antibiotics for an insignificant elevated blood test. The nurse had to convince him that it wasn't protocol. I hate this place. some of the doctors are good. But good luck seeing them when you need them.</Text>< Rating>

It's usually hit or miss with the doctors, some are excellent and some are just terrible. Their phone system is absolutely awful, the options never take you to the correct department and the staff seemingly doesn't know how (or care) to transfer you to the right department. So expect a long wait on the phone and in person and don't expect to be able to talk to the person you need the first (or fifth) time you're transferred.< /text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>Doctor Zane was great, but would have been even better if she gotten all the information from the nurse who took temp, blood pressure, etc but then again she was writing it down on a sticky note. I had to tell the doctor the temp and the oxygen levels were low.  On top of that the check in nurse had no paperwork and had to ask me why we were here.  The doctor even apologize first thing when we walked in for the wait.  It's sad when a doctor has to do that instead of getting down to business.  It's sad that they have talented people but no processes to make things efficient and people end up getting frustrated with that fact which makes the whole clinic look unprofessional.  My guess is that people go back because they don't have another choice.< /Text>< pics>

Took my 1 year old daughter in to be seen today. After standing in line for 15 minutes just to check in, I spent another 15 at the window as the receptionist was either new or not a receptionist because she kept waiting for help. They then put my daughter's first name as her last name, and her last name as her first name, and don't change it even when I tell them it's wrong twice. The Dr comes in with the wrong patients chart, which is forgivable, mistakes do happen.

Waiting for two hours at Wal-Mart to pick up my daughter's prescription, because even though the office said they would fix my daughter's name, they did not and Wal-Mart won't give it to us. Not the first time I've had issues here, but I hope it's my last time I have to visit.</Text>

<text>Tried to get through on the phone to make an appointment.  Finally got through the to the receptionist who immediately hung up on me.  I tried to call back and was kept waiting on hold for 15 minutes.  I spent the next 15 minutes looking for a new doctor.This is the third incident that I have had with the receptionists. I tried to sign up for the patient portal but since my husband is signed up and we both have the same e-mail address, I am not allowed to have access to my own patient portal using the same e-mail.  Something needs to be done about both of these problems because it is easier to drive to Redding to see a doctor than to waste time trying to see one here. I only continue to go here for my dermatologist, Dr. Adams,  great caring doctor.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<resp>None</resp><Review>The staff only cares about looking cute. A certain doctor there had me on a dangerous combination of meds, my pharmacist alerted me and he quickly switched my meds. There is no human concern for patients, no desire to help or sense of urgency when it comes to refilling prescriptions. I have waited over a week for medications while the requests sit in their fax. Not a good place. Do not recommend. Doctors and staff have no business working in the medical field.</Review>< UserId.>

If I could have given this place no stars I would have! This place is HORRIBLE! If you want to go somewhere and NOT be helped but still be forced into paying a bill for having the doctor not touch you but only tell you " I can't help you" this is the place for you! But if you are looking to actually have a doctor help you and give you medical advice I would suggest you go somewhere else! Nothing like having to pay a bill to protect your credit because they refuse to drop the bill even when no medical advise was given. This place is TRASH! DON'T go here!< /Review>

<Text>There is no urgency among the staff.. the ladies checking you in take there time to get to you. She didn't understand the information packet I had to sign that I received, you can hear them having a good ol' time while we wait patiently (after a while, not so patiently). It's very frustrating when everyone around you, including yourself, is sick or looking miserable.<//Text>< user>

This place is horrible, you can't make an appointment with family Medicine unless you've been seen before. There are zero doctors accepting new patients, the receptionists are rude and ignorant. Impossible to be seen at this facility. Even worse since dignity took over. Pediatrics is the only positive< /review>

I am tired of false things being put in my file like I'm an alcoholic I don't even drink. Then being talked to like I'm a baby because I wasn't in the condiction the doctor thought I should be in.  But this last thing has me pissed. Dr.Minky Sanai tried to take me off my pain meds once before when I told her  "you have not sent me to one doctor yet that could help me so no you are not taking me off them". I finalky found a specialist on my own . Now she stopped my pain meds because supposedly she received a call I am selling them.  I don't even know anyone that would want them.  I believe it is a bunch of bs.b  so I am looking for a new doctor.  I am sick of her antics and her treating me like a child.</review>

Worst clinic I've ever been to. On top of the fact that a few of the doctors are complete jackasses, they continue to bill me for some medical service I never had. In fact they actually said that it was for something that was over a year after I had left Lassen and went to a far better clinic. Thses people and the clinic they work in are crooked and incompetent!!!</review>

< Review>
Today I had my first visit with Dr Ahmadpour, First off My appointment time was changed without calling or leaving me a voicemail. 2nd when the Dr walked in the first thing he said was I can't fill narcotics or any anxiety medication, which wasn't my biggest concern. I had came in for a medical exemption So I can continue being seen be my liver specialist at Stanford. After asking if he could do that for me he said it would take "too much effort" and would be easier for him just to referral me to UCSF..   This is the first Doctor I've almost walked out on he had no clue about my Liver disease and continued to say It's hepatitis related, which is completely wrong, I have PSC that was a complication of UC. Please do some research before you walk into a patient's room pretending like you know what medical conditions they do/don't have.<//Review>

I went in knowing I was a walk in and it would take a while. that was at 4pm. After I was put into the room, after the I submitted a urine test theyhad forgotten about me until I realized all but two people had left the building.  It was now 6:34. They admitted to forgetting about me and the urine sample was right where they had told me to leave it. Seems the person who runs the tests had already gone home.  Did not get the care I expected. Told me to come back if prescription does not work.I really doubt that I will.</Review>

One of the worst pediatrician clinics I have ever been too and let me add I have six children so I have dealt with plenty. They are all in a hurry!! If you want info about your children's visit you have to ask because they are in too big of hurry to volunteer the information. If you get immunizations ask for record because they don't give it to you otherwise oh and ea appt is about two hours with wait. Really wish there were more options in Red Bluff</review>

< Review>
I know my dad goes here and they have been given him a hard time with his medication ever sense his doctor quit and they won't fill his medicine that he's been on for 6 yrs. Sense he was injured at work. My dad faces shoulder replacements in both shoulders sue to his injuries as well as neck and lower back surgery. My dad stays in a lot of pain all the time and he always sucks it up as much as he's able to. I know my dad has never abused his medicine and wouldn't for I lost my mom and his wife to a overdose.  My dad served 8 yrs in the Marines from 89-97 and he's never been one for meds and it upsets me seeing him suffer as he does and lessen don't care because they told him they wasn't going to fill his meds for the 3 days he asked for until he got in to see his new pain management doctor. He wasn't asking for a full month and has never asked to get his meds early. In three days time was all he had asked for and they were due too. It's crazy how they have treated him sense his doctor he was seeing there quit. Now they have some new doctors that really don't care for his health. If they did they wouldn't let him suffer withdrawals for 3 days just because this new doctor doesn't believe in pain meds. My dad is my hero. I'll never go to this hospital and if you're reading this I'd find a new one asap.  They have done this to several patients that go there and reason o know is that his caregiver has a fee that gone there and left for they also were getting pour treatment. Now my dad's going to suffer for no reason and it's a shame how they've treated him of late. I can't wait for my dad to get better treatment at another hospital.</Review>

I have to have reverse shoulder surgeries in both shoulders, another neck surgery and lower back surgery. When I I first started going back in 2014 I have been on pain meds ever since but as soon as my doctor quit working there I had major issues on getting my meds filled. I never asked for my meds before my due dates I never been doctor shopping I never abused my medicine ever and won't and now all off a suden they get this new doctor from Australia that won't fill my meds I need until I go see my pain management doctor which I'm blessed that doctor Misra helped me get in. I only needed a three day supply until I gone seen my pain management doctor in which I only asked for the three days and was told no they not going to fill them. So if I were you I'd find another hospital beside lessen medical group. The administration sucks as well and the lady that works there acts all calm and sweet but is a real smart ass and would get better care at the lowest VA then there. So don't go. I'm telling you now you'll always will have an issue either with your meds or poor treatment by the doctors. They don't care about their patients at all.</Review>

The doctors have too many patients and don't have any time for you. You become a burden. Dr. Wickenheiser is the worst doctor I have ever been stuck with. As my third doctor they tossed me withat he has cut me off all of my meds no warning. I have been on them for 8 years. Lassen has held my records I cannot get another doctor for over 30 days. I have been off of my medicine for 3 weeks no one will help me. The staff is rude, they talk behind your back. As a former nurse and firefighter/EMT the worst place to look for help. I suggest to go somewhere else.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><date>1465257210909< /date><pictures>None< /pictures><review>Misdiagnosis & Billing Issues:

Medical Part First:  I saw a nurse practitioner and never saw the doctor.  She diagnosed my wife and I with "allergies" and told us to take an allergy medicine.  My wife and I both went to other doctors a few days later when returning to our home state.  I was prescribed anti-biotics, prenisone, etc..  My doctor's office could not believe the poor misdiagnosis.

Billing Issue:  To continue the shame, I received a bill in the mail because my insurance was denied.  I was informed that my provider was accepted at time of service or wouldn't have gone there.  Apparently, this was not the case and they only accepted one type of my insurance.  PPO vs HMO.  This was never told to me at the time of service and I was assured my insurance would be accepted!  I went online and it said I may be sent to collections which would kill my excellent credit score so I was forced to just submit a payment.  So not only did I have to pay to see my doctor and for medicines when I got back & suffer for several more days before I got home but I got stuck  paying these people the full amount.

Lastly, my insurance provider told me they were billed by a Doctor Fish who I never interacted with.  Apparently they bill you the same for seeing a nurse practitioner as a Doctor.  I question the ethics of this as well.

Please never allow yourself to be put in this situation.  Go to a different medical provider so you don't end up in my situation.  Your'e office should feel ashamed of your terrible services and outrageous billing procedures.</review>< gmap_id>

Dr Misra is the BEST doctor I have ever been to.He explained everything the tests I had said so that I could understand what was going on.He took the time.He wasnt in a rush to get me out of the office.I have great respect for him.He is very kind,and cares about his patient.I trust in his advice.I have changed my diet since seeing him,not only have I lost 7 pounds I feel much better. Thank you Sooooo Much Doc.. : )   Corina Lemos</Review>

Lassen Medical is the worst. Overcrowded, understaffed, and rude staff. I absolutely hate going here and avoid it if possible.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This is the second time this happens to me with the staff but I never felt as bad as this day, today May 12, 2017 I had an appointment for my child in Lassen medical group and I had the confidence and faith that I would go out more Quiet from there since my child has been coughing for more than three months and coughs and takes away while taking medicine and spend a month and returns and now is suffering from allergy but it is too much because he can not sleep because his nose. It is completely covered and I decided to make an appointment with her pediatrician named Nanjeari. I am not sure of her name and then the appointment was 11:20 and they told me that she was busy in the hospital and told me that another pediatrician could attend me. Frend is called something like this because this doctor when I enter the room told me in English that, what my son had and told him that I did not speak English and said I speak a little Spanish then I said fine but when I wonder what I had my child told him he can't breathe very well because he has an allergy and I wanted to explain what my concern was because I couldn't say much since she interrupted me twice, I feel very frustrated because I couldn't defend my rights as a patient I think it is lack of professionalism why? Why to be the director of St. Elizabeth hospital before all the patients are because they are supposed to do their job well and not because I do not speak English I deserve the treatment he gave me or I do not know what it is the problem I am very dismayed because I do not understand what made her treat me so I do not know if having medical does not cover a good treatment and good medical care because to be professional I was in a hurry I was very surprised I have a lot of courage and I am disappointed in the clinic I have already spoken badly about it but I did not want to believe it and now I am completely sure that they do not attend as they should be sad to know that they only exercise their "profession" only for money and not for love it is unfair to me that only for not speaking English and For having medical humiliate us.

Esta es la segunda ocasión que me pasa esto con el personal pero nunca me sentí tan mal como este día ,hoy mayo 12 de 2017 tuve una cita para mi niño en Lassen medical group y tuve la confianza y la fe de que iba a salir mas tranquila de ahí ya que mi niño durante mas de tres meses a estado enfermo le da tos y se le quita mientras toma medicina y pasa un mes y le vuelve y ahorita esta padeciendo de alergia pero ya es demasiado por que no puede dormir debido a que su nariz. Esta completamente tapada y decidí hacerle cita con su pediatra de nombre nanjeari no estoy muy segura de su nombre y entonces la cita era alas 11:20 y me dijeron q ella estaba ocupada en el hospital y me dijeron que me podía atender otra pediatra. que se llama Frend algo así pues esta doctora cuando entro al cuarto me dijo en ingles que, que era lo que tenia mi hijo y le dije que yo no hablaba ingles y dijo yo hablo poquito español entonces dije a que bien pero cuando me pregunto que que tenia mi niño le dije no puede respirar muy bien pues tiene alergia y quise explicarle cual era mi preocupación pues no pude decir mucho ya que ella en dos ocasiones me interrumpió me siento muy frustrada por que no pude defender mis derechos como paciente creo que es falta de profesionalismo por que? Por qué para ser la directora del hospital St. Elizabeth antes que todo están los pacientes por que se supone que para eso están para hacer su trabajo bien y no por que yo no hable ingles me merezco el trato que me dio o no se cual es el problema estoy muy consternada por que no entiendo que la hizo tratarme así no se si por tener medical no cubre una buen trato y buena atención medica por que para ser profesional traía mucha prisa me quede muy sorprendida tengo mucho coraje y estoy decepcionada de la clínica antes ya me hablado mal de ahí pero no quise creer y ahora estoy completamente segura de que no atienden como deberían que tristeza saber que solo ejercen su "profesión" solo por dinero y no por amor se me hace injusto que solo por no hablar ingles y por tener medical nos humillen.<//Text>< Pictures>

Absolutely wonderful steak place.  I had the prime rib and it was melt in your mouth.  I want to try the rib eye next.  Staff is so friendly and helpful. Their 2 egg breakfast was great.  I'll go back for sure.<//review>

Apparently the state of Nevada tourism board has invited people to tag the vehicles.   This has resulted in the art being sprayed over.  This, in my opinion, has diminished the uniqueness and allure of the car forest.<//Review>

The food was decent but the charge was different from the bill..... it was not that much different but a few dollars times how many customers? Basically the bill for 2 people was 38 and with the tip the total came to 42 but the bill charged was 51...<//Review>

Sat down to eat with some friends, got our drinks within 10 minutes. Ordered our food in about 25 minutes. Food never came almost 40 minutes after ordering. Asked about our food. They never even gave us an update. Person bringing drinks n coffee was great. Other than that. Worst service I've ever had! Good luck.<//text>

<Text>Not good experience today. Been going to Ryderz for the last 8 years always good. Today service was not a good experance. Started off as usual with coffee, gave waitress our order, asked to make sure our English muffin was VERY crispy. Order came fast, when we received to muffin it was barely cook asked to redue when the waitress return she stated they were extrimly busy so we accepted it. Than we received the bill, coffee went up in price $3.59 a cup. I feel we should have been told of the addional cost before we ordered it..When we questioned it head waitess said when food price's go up that also includes the drinks. (No sorry). We won't be going back. (Sorry).<//Text><name>Donna Hoover</name></record></dataset><record>

Overall: it was good

Cons: Expensive!

The prices listed on Google are incorrect. They are half the prices of what they actually charge. Or maybe this place just charged me double?

My order was a burger and basket of rings/fries

Google has it listed: 7.99 + 3.99.
Ryders charged me: 13.99 + 7.99.
They didn't confirm the price over the phone(i know no restaurant usually does without asking). So, I didn't know till I was receiving the food. Dont like to cause any issues so I accepted and now I know.

My review of the food - It was good. Fries were made perfect. Burger was just good. Burger patty was to small for the bun. 1/4 of the bun was left over once the burger was done. So I would say no where worth 14 dollars.<//text>

The food and service was good!  Minus 1 star because when we were asked what we wanted to drink and I asked what kind of beer they had, the girl responded with, "I don't know, coors and coors light I guess.  I don't go back to the bar".
Maybe she was new.  She should have just offered to get someone else to help.< /text>

I’m here from out of town and my friend brought me to this place. They did not fail to impress with the fantastic customer service and delicious food. Virginia took care of us from start to finish and it was pleasant. She made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I will definitely be back here every time I’m in town without a doubt. Thank you!< /Review>

The server that answered the phone was rude and abrupt. She let me know that the company who designed the website would charge them 250.00 to change prices. Truly that is none of my concern. I was not given the printed prices and mentioned they take down the website and was hung up on. Not the right way to do business in this time or any time. Get it right Ryderz!< /review>< Pics>

<review>I’m Italian, I’ve tried this restaurant driving on the street going to Yosemite...
Well I adore it. It takes me into another mindset.
It looks like I am in a real American Diner, with no turists and a good atmosphere.
The blond woman who served us is really kind and she customized without any problem the order we made. The staff is working with the smile on their face and the space is clean. I loved it and I enjoyed myself. Thank you Ryderz!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJMeaVDLfCXmNq08j2pTr6pmFLUEVWvf7Z-wTU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg0rbcZ9Ed_C_5jNoiakk5DNVPUuZKIuDvq5hj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Had the chance to try this place before COVID-19 and by far some of the best burgers we’ve had. The bacon was thick cut and super flavorful. It is because of this place I am no longer a vegetarian 🥴🥴.</Review>

Great place to get a nice meal after being in the mountains.  The Oreo shake was amazing.  They serve breakfast all day and if you get one of the specials you can get a pancake with it instead of toast 👍. The staff was prompt and have a great attitude.  I will eat here again next time I'm coming home from backpacking.<//Review>

Delicious food and great service. Our portions were plentiful. Everything was well seasoned and tasty. The vegetable beef soup was hearty with thick chunks of beef that fell apart in your mouth.
The teriyaki chicken Cobb salad was gorgeous and filling. The biscuits fluffy and gravy flavorful.<//Text>

The service was horrible. The waitress only came buy our table once. The food was horrible. My wife ordered a three cheese omelette, and it wasn't cooked all of the way. The cheese on top of and inside wasn't even melted and it was cold, so my wife didn't eat. When we told the waitress, she acted like she didn't really care and said, "Oh, well I guess I'll give you a $5.00 discount.". I'm thankful for the discount, but really. Should have removed the whole meal from the bill. Never going there again.<//Text>

Get a new cook!
We've ordered a hamburger and prime rib.  It took much too long for our food to be served, it was overlooked, and the stake went back to the kitchen. I've tried to have a medium hamburger instead,  and it as well was overcooked and dry.
For other hand the restaurant manager Virginia intervened and was willing to satisfy us in any possible way and she offered many  options for compensation,  so her attitude gets a 5 star mark.!< /review>

Great restaurant . I absolutely love their fried pickles and the hot wings are my favorite! I only put 4 stars because I have a 1 month old and there is no changing table and I really don't like having to change him on a little bench or on the floor in the restroom.</Text>

We were so very embarrassed when we brought in our family for a visit.  You practically have to beg for coffee and water refills.  It takes 15+ minutes to get your order taken.  And then the wait to get your food.

We've only been there for breakfast.  The service has been so bad (for example, servers chewing out staff in front of us), we've given up on this place.  Decent food.  Decent prices.  Gosh awful service.< /Review><time>1538429066709</time><pictures>None<//pictures><name>John Sturgis< /name><userid>115594858456281671004<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Ryderz's was great, while waiting for the family to arrive Virginia fixed me the best Bloody Mary, good Breakfast for all, if the kids like  chocolate milk, ask  Virginia to mix them up a special glass, yummy. And she's just a sweetheart all around, Thanks for the Great Service❣️ we'll be back.</Text>

<review>Extremely slow service, waited almost 30 mins for three orders and there were only 4 other tables occupied. Our hostess was either very strange or on drugs of some kind. The person who took our order and brought us our food was very nice and apologetic for the wait time. Table was dirty and had sticky syrup on it. I've been here several times before and it was not like this so not sure what's happening there. I had the club sandwich and would not order it again. However the thick cut sweet potato fries were delicious.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>Living in town, I usually go to Ryderz about once a month.

It's usually never crowded so being seated and ordering is easy. The wait staff is friendly and will always take the time to get your order right.

The food is pretty average. Tasty, but nothing special. The portions are not always that generous.

The menu has a good number of choices. That is one of the things I like most about Ryderz.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Horrible service. The bad service explains why there was only 3 tables occupied when we arrived. The lady who sat us and took our drink order was the only nice person there. The waitress spent her time on the phone and ignoring customers. Cooks took 20 mins to make 3 sandwiches and 1 burger, but sent out a raw burger that was undercooked. Didn't get any dressing for our salads and had to ask 3 times for it.</Text>

We waited at least 30 minutes for a waitress to take our order but were ignored as the waitresses took orders from other people who had come in after we did.  We informed the hostess thatcwe were ready to order.  She informed the waitress, whoturned to look at us.  We waited five more minutes after this.  She walked by us twice more during this time withoit a word and took another otder from another customer who had entered after we did.  We got up and walked out I  will NOT return.</Text>

Love all of the great food you get for your money. They make the best French toast ever and you get at least 6 to eight pieces the hash browns are amazing as well</review>

<Text>Like a really bad Dennys, really bad!:tortilla soup was super salty, seemed more like a really runny chilli with tons of taco season. Steak was ordered med rare, came well done and tasted like old meat. No flavor. Veggies were frozen not fresh and soggy. Baked potato was probably 3 days old, not fresh. Husband ordered eggs benedict and he said his meal rated about 2.5. I won't be back. Not even willing to give second chance. On a good note,  the service was decent and restaurant was clean.<//Text><Rate>2< /Rate><response>None< /response>< user_id>

<text>They give you a large portion of food which is great and the food taste very good, I would like to go again soon but food can be pricey for some things and they gave us our salad we ordered then brought our food out a couple minutes after which we felt kind of rushed since the restaurant did not have lots people at moment but overall the place had very good food which is great of great value.</text><name>Holly< /name><Gmap_id>0x8090f9ced36e4921:0x80c7ba9a4dffbb9e<//Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>105542395619981944442< /UserId.><time>1530601649381</time>< Resp>

Good food, VERY hearty portions ... mainly american style menu items; i like the chicken fried steak, and the pancakes are HUGE so unless i'm super hungry i usually just go with toast for breakfast.

good atmosphere, nothing too fancy, and servers are great, but sometimes during rush hours they're pretty tied up ...<//review>

Walked in and nobody was in there except some other patrons.  Waited for at least 5 minutes before my husband went and looked for someone.  He looked all over, including in the kitchen and there wasn't even a cook in the kitchen.  Just as we were getting ready to leave a waitress came out.<//text>
