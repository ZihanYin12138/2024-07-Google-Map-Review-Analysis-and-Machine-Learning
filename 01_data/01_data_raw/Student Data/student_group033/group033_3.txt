I'm so happy with the service I received at this dental office! The front desk is very professional and signed me in very quickly, with no hassles. I'm used to the spacers (in the mouth) during the X-ray digging into my tongue or gums, but I've never had a more painless X-ray experience in my life. The staff is extremely friendly and professional and made me feel very comfortable thoughout the entire treatment. I also felt that my cleaning was very thorough.

Dr. Yun did a fantastic job with my tooth fillings. I never felt any pain when the numbing was injected into my gums and the actual filling process was quick and painless too. Highly recommend this place!<//Text>

I had never felt so comfortable at a dental office. This office comforts you from the front to the back; the dental assistants, Pablo and Daniel and the entire staff is are amazing. The doctor is super smart and he explains everything step-by-step I love their work and I would definitely recommend Dr. James Kim and dental assistants. I have faith in them. The are Amazing!</Text>

I had a really great experience in this office. I feel like they truly do try there best to do what's best for our Little One rather than taking the fast rout. I wish I would have brought my son here sooner. I'm sure they would have taken the proper steps to preventing his teeth from decaying and spreading in the 1st place. Definitely would recommend this location to mothers for their kids.< /Review>

Won’t ever go again. I prefer to pay for a job done but done right. The dentist was in a hurry to go to lunch. He did some refills that fell off in 2 days. So basically he only did holes in my teeth. That now has to be a root canal. Won’t be taking my kids back either.</review>

<text>Nothing but great experiences here. I always get nervous when it comes to my teeth but the staff here really makes you feel comfortable. The environment is very friendly and professional. The dr is very honest and very caring. Him and his staff are the reason why I come back every 6 months and I tell everyone about them.</text><name>C C< /name><userid>101126493569844512150< /userid></record>

Amazing kid friendly dental office! All staff are super professional, friendly, not to mention they work fast and take care of you and your children. Yareli is one of the assistants and she does an amazing job working with children. She’s patient and explains the treatments/work your child will be getting done, shes very knowledgeable of what she and/or others will be doing so if you have any questions she is the one to ask for clarification. Yareli is super helpful and friendly!  Hope this review helps anyone who is looking for a dental office they can trust with their children!< /Text>

<text>I love this place!
The dentist can be a very scary specially for kids .
What i love about this place is that the staff is very friendly , the dentists
are very professional and the place is small but clean.
I use to take my kids to western Dental on King and Budlong but their service is horrible . They don't let you come in with you kids into the room and they tie them down at all times. At Children's Dental World they let you in the room so you can actually see what they are doing and they ask you if you kid needs to be restrained or not . Although  my girls aren't  big fans of the dentist i am very confident that they feel more comfortable at Children's Dental world . I too feel more comfortable bringing them here .
i highly recommend this place .< /text></record>

I’ve been coming to this location for over two years and they really outdo themselves with the service and attention and made me feel comfortable with the many treatments I needed and very patient and attentive with my personal issues with needles and inability to open my mouth for too long. Would highly recommend this Location.<//Text>

I am a really nervous person when it come to the dentist and the doctor right here always calm me down. She is really good to me the best. I bring all my 4 kids here n they love it. Its a really friendly n clean environment. The min u walk in u can see how they r. I act like a little kid when it come to the dentist n she always put up with me n lets me calm down. Lol n my daughters do cry a little cause they like me but tye min she is done they tell me they do t feel nothing.<//Text>

<text>Great and friendly people. They don't take everything. If you have small appliances (hot water bottle, coffee makers,..., etc.), go and check with the city/county instead. They take the rest and are willing to help you out on some items. My garage is now clear of electronic wastes....other than the old small appliances.<//text>< rate>

< Review>
very helpful and professional. They took and my electronics for free. The guys in the warehouse unload the stuff from my car. Wendy was very nice and explained the process of ewaste and the difference between ewaste and universal waste. I highly recommend Evergreen to drop off ewaste.< /Review>

<text>while I was at their store, I was impressed by their effortless service,
I went there to buy a LaserJet printer with a USB port,  they showed me at least 6 printers, they powered each one of them on and made a test page to make sure it worked and had a good toner level left,
before we left the store, the dusted, cleaned and polished the unit for me,
and showed me other useful parts in the store to buy,
the best of all, they took back and recycled my old big printers,
I really  love their services. This is the best recycle center in town
I will go back to their center, for sure.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This store’s employee need to learn some manners, they are frequently rude and unpleasant. However, I walked in with my wife and after that unpleasantness (which doesn’t always happen, many times their customer service is stellar), we found her some killer deals. Like a matching blouse and woman’s suit combo for her work for 40% off, totaling well under 100!< /Text>

<Name>claudia arreola</Name><Text>Ordered from then didn’t receive some items, tried to contact them but their contact information isn’t correct on their website, more than likely so people can’t dispute with them about missing merchandise. Worst customer service ever tried to dispute it with my bank and was denied, never shopping from them again and I recommend no one does because you won’t receive your merchandise and they’ll just take your money.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

Worst customer service ever! Ordered from them and did not receive any email after 2 weeks. Emailed them couple of times asking for updates and told me they are out of stock of an item I ordered and that it'll be delivered the following week. Got an email April 23rd of a tracking number but after 2 weeks, tracking page says the same thing "label created". emailed them a lot of times, no response until today where they REFUNDED MY ORDER BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE MY ITEMS IN STOCK and THAT THEY HAVE BEEN "TRYING TO REACH ME" WHICH THEY HAVEN'T SINCE I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY EMAIL FROM THEM. THEY COULD HAVE REFUNDED ME THAT THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED FROM THEM. but they had to wait this long. and why did they send me a tracking number if they do not have my items?!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We are sorry you have received the items in such conditions. We are a bit confused as to the “burnt sugar” on your lollipops. This lollipop is made out of burnt sugar which makes caramel. This lollipop is coded with caramel and is filled with delicious tamarindo chile. As explained to you via email we have opened multiple lollipops and let me let you and everybody else know they are just a MUST TRY. They are filled with all the right spicy yet sweet flavors. We have yet to receive the photos of the “burnt sugar” on the lollipops received. Also, we let you know that unfortunately we are not able to provide replacements since your claim is outside of our 30-day claim period. Due to the purchase date being over 2 months now we suggested proper storage for the candy. We are not implying that you do not know how to store candy in any way. We have added photos of this particular lollipop so you can see they are in perfect condition. We were in the process of sending you the proof of opened lollipops on our end but you were quick to assume that we weren’t going to send any.\n\nThank you,\nManagement'}<//resp><user>108968742757907251482<//user>< username>

I’ve been a return customer a few times. However, when I contacted them to inform them that the Xiupadin paletas that I ordered back in Nov. we’re burnt and inedible, all they had to say was send us a picture so we can send it to our provider. Then they had the audacity to suggest that I did not know how to store candy, as if sugar burns after it’s packaged. They claimed that they opened other packages to check but when I asked for a picture, they failed to send one. I guess I’ll take my $50 orders elsewhere.</Text>

<review>I have visited this store twice and both times I found the workers to be unfriendly and not welcoming at all.  They watched me like a hawk which made me feel like I needed to keep my hands where they can see them. They do have beautiful pottery and textiles.  They offer no jewelry and unfortunately their clothing is behind the counter in boxes so you have to ask for assistance. It’s just too much work to have someone else pull blouses out digging for your size and desired style. Would be so much nicer if everything was hanging and you could go through it yourself. I gave up and purchased a blouse I only half loved because I felt guilty making the guy dig through the box. This store is too crowded.<//review>< user_id>

If I could give no stars I would. Ordered online for two weeks after eta showed in Cali. Emailed to get eta after three emails later asked for order number apologized that order was not sent. Asked when will be sent out 3 emails later crickets no response. Asked for refund since delay and missed birthday party for My 82 year old mother. Still no response, no wonder people buy from big corporations like Amazon. Sad that you try to help local businesses but if this is the service they provide. Shake my head shame on you Sandy imports.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The store was clean and organized, the prices were very reasonable, and the clerk was nice and attentive without being annoyingly overbearing. In addition to having quite a bit of restaurant/kitchen gear, they have a wonderful selection of different decorative imports, which is what I was looking for to redecorate my bedroom: beautifully crafted baskets, pottery, serapes, papel picado, and sombreros in many colors and sizes. This is a great place to buy a small or large unique gift made in Mexico! I had a great shopping experience and will shop there again.❤💛💚< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) I went on Wednesday to this store. I liked everything that had variety but I did not like that many of the products were priceless and then the dark lightless. I came from an hour to enter a darkness. But good products if I leave them.

Fui El Miercoles a esta tienda. Me gusto todo lo que tenian de variedad pero no me gusto que muchos de los productos no tenian precios y luego los pasios oscuros sin luz. Vine de una hora para entrar a una oscuridad. Pero buenos productos si se los dejo.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Buy an article online, the shipping would take no more than 4 days, unfortunately almost two weeks ago and I still do not receive anything.

The trail from the Vista point to slacker Hill was moderately intensive and we loved the hike. Specially near the slacker ridge, about 1 mile from the start, the wind gets intense and could literally blow you off. But a few meters ahead, the trail ascends to a beautiful view. Loved the hike and would come back again.

Mind it, this trail is less travelled, so u can trudge at a decent pace and reach the top in about 45-50 mins, watch out for the steep ascends ... Hydrate and take in the view...</Review>

It is one of the best spot to view San Francisco and Golden Gate Bridge. The hike is only about 0.4 miles, but the elevation is over 300 feet. You may also go down to the front side slope to find good spots for photography. When I was up there today (4/21/19), it was windy. Today is only for scouting, I will definitely come back. If you have hiking sticks, bring them.< /Review>

The view was great, the hike was shorter and more crowded than I would have liked.  The view was great.< /Text>

Steep steps to start with but the views are so worth it!
Can be chilly if the fog is blowing in from the ocean so bring an extra layer if you're going to hang out at the top to admire the view.< /Review>

A killer up hill battle. I believe all the best photos of the bay are taken from this location. It's higher than the bunker view just at the start of the road. And way less people. It's really enjoyable to be up there looking at about the height of the golden gate. You should hike it.< /review>

I had heard about Slackers Hill and it being the hidden gem of the Bay!  I decided to fly my girlfriend and I on a trip to SF Bay.  I had it planned for us to go for a run down the bay, across the Golden Gate, and up the trail to Slackers Hill.  This is where I proposed to my now wife in marriage.  It was the most beautiful and secluded place to view the Bay.  A hidden gem it is!!!  It was a clear Oct. 9, and her birthday!  Now when we see pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge, we see Slackers Hill overlooking the bridge, the place where we had a very special moment in our life!<//text>

My favorite place to view San Francisco. Less crowded than Twin Peaks, and its an amazing view.

Only trouble is the 10-20minute hike up.< /text>

<Date>1440972037505<//Date><Review>This spot was well worth the hike up, it felt like an age to get there but I could not have been happier to get there. I'd seen the view from Battery Spencer in the film the internship overlooking the bridge and knew I wanted to propose to my girlfriend there. However when we got there for some reason I believed the scene was shot higher so I insisted we look for the right spot, so we hiked up a trail for what seemed an eternity but we finally arrived at Slackers Hill and it was much more than either of us could have wished for. I proposed to my now fiancée on the 5th August and it was the best moment of my life so far! We engraved on a rock to commemorate the occasion, I hope it's still there! If anyone can get there then it's a must.< /Review><Name>Daniel Hemmings<//Name>< pictures>

<text>Was visiting LA some years ago from SC and heard about True Tattoo...had to grab one, at least try. My soon to-be fiancé at the time was sweet enough to spend some of the trip with me on what she may not have been into, but she knew that I was. Got tattooed by an older school artist named Sal Trevino, covered something up with a panther, walk in style. Nearing the end of the night, knew it probably wasn’t going to be cool, but he made time. Got a sweet tattoo and he even made some jokes with some of the other guys there. Cool shop, cool artists. And cool warm towel trick, thanks guys.</text></record>

if I could give more than 5 stars I totally would. Great shop, full of very friendly people. It's very clean, you see the artist take out a new needle to do your tattoo (new or sanitized, not sure which) Everyone was super welcoming, which made me a lot less nervous (I'm deathly afraid of needles so this was HUGE.) The artist I worked with, Ian, was really gentle and he was very insistent on making sure that this was the tattoo I wanted and that my arm was definitely where I wanted it. From an art standpoint, the lines are very clean  a week later, even with the peeling it still looks like new. overall, clean shop with a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. I will definitely be going back.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe0ksFvH0lihdBxi7miLx0hqd8JKX7Fvwekms6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2bf3bccc7b659:0x86ed5309179eed81</gmapID></record>

<Review>Anyway, idk what those few bad reviews were about cause everyone here is super nice and laid back. *just a tip, when knowing your appt is going to be a few hours long, try parking at the lot right next to it. It's only 10 bucks all day. Instead of having to move your car out on the street every 2 hours.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Needless today say I have been more than impressed. I have been going to Matt Howse for a full sleeve and a few other tattoos and he's killed it every time! I have gotten tons of compliments on the art work and the color when I've been in SF and the Bay Area as well as when traveling in Tahoe, Vegas and Hawaii.</text></record>

<Review>I spent about six months researching tattoo artists before settling on Ian Jones at True Tattoo. Looking at his work it was closest to what I wanted. I had always wanted an arm sleeve, and had a good idea of what I wanted. My initial meeting with Ian was fantastic. He's a wonderful artist and listened to me carefully, asked for as many notes that I could provide and also photo examples of what I liked and also what I didn't like. On the second visit we mapped out the entire sleeve in terms of what artwork would go where, and he got to work. The entire process beginning to end was extremely collaborative, and that's what I liked. I made it clear from the offset that my goal was to get the entire sleeve done very quickly, and 7 weeks and 5 sessions later I was done. Scheduling was very easy and he was always on time, and ready to go. He was also very flexible as one time I had to delay a session due to a work meeting, and he made it work. I love his artwork, his attention to detail and his process. It put me at ease right away that when stenciling a portion of the tattoo that he would remove and restart multiple times if he wasn't happy with the placement or layout. He would always have me look at the stencil, and take some time for the concept to sink in before making sure I was 100% happy with it. I couldn't recommend Ian and True Tattoo more. A fantastic experience beginning to end.< /Review>< pics>

<review>I had the pleasure of having Sean Smith draw out my tattoo and recommend how to fit it on my left shoulder/bicep area the best way. His amicable attitude helped me relax along with his vast experience in the industry. It was really reassuring to have a clean, sterile and welcoming environment for my first tattoo experience. Definitely plan on going back for touch-ups and other pieces.<//review>< date>

Walked in and was greeted by everyone in the shop immediately. Everyone was super down to earth and it was a great atmosphere. My artist Sal got my idea perfectly and drew it up to my liking. He was super funny and kept my mind off the tattoo with some life stories of his. The line work was absolutely amazing and I would 100% recommend getting tatted there.

Do remember that good tats aren't cheap and cheap tats aren't good. Shop minimum of $100 for quality work!< /Text>

Will came highly rec'd by a dear friend and Tattoo Professional, he did the prettiest script I have ever seen, and I got it and a Single Letter Knuckle Tattoo.

Both look great, the studio, as well as the artists, and ambiance were way cool, and what you would expect from a shop that has been around for a while.... Oliver Peck, and the crew are top notch. Go here and get what you want the way you want it, only it will probably end up better then you expected in the first place.

Very calming and nice and I'd definitly request for him in the future. On top of that my tattoo came out super clean and was just what i wanted and it wasn't a bad process at all.

Had a great experience here. They are punctual (I arrived on time for my appointment and did not have to wait). The staff is very friendly while being super professional, I felt completely at home and relaxed, which is something I don't say often. Not only do they uphold all necessary health/safety standards, they are very straightforward about this and take pride in showing you all materials to be used and keeping everything very orderly (this is a really big deal to me, I need to see the needle come out of the packaging and go in a disposal container and know all hands have been washed, etc). While I had talked about the tattoo I was going to get with the artist before I went in, when I got there and we actually got to pointing-at-the-area placement we realized where I had been planning on was not ideal for longevity/possibility of distortion. The artist explained this to me in full, suggested several good nearby placements, and said ultimately the decision was mine but wanted me to make an informed decision as opposed to not knowing, and to take all the time I needed to think about this, whether in shop or rescheduling to a later date. I went with one of the alternate locations that was just a few inches from the original spot (we actually put the template for the tattoo on the location and I was encouraged to look at it in the mirror a bit to make sure it worked for me before we started) and am very pleased with how it turned out, but it was this level of "your body, your decision, no pressure" that I think is essential in any establishment, especially one where you have the product for forever. Also, they thoroughly go through the healing care with you and provide a very detailed printout of post tattoo care and bandage you up really well. And of course while I have so emphasized the clean and safe elements, of course the artists are super talented and the old-school tattoo parlor vibe is in full effect. Definitely recommending this to anyone looking for a place to have their next tattoo done.<//Text>

I came to these guys on Saturday to make a mandala tattoo wrapping around my leg. Their response was surprising - “We are not sure we can make it. We don’t think it will look ok. Even if you wanna do it with us, you gotta email our geometric tattooist!!!!!!. But she’ll be back in a few weeks. So you’ll have to make and appointment for 7-8 hours of work.”
The interesting thing is that I went to OZ Tattoo, which is a few blocks away, and I had my tattoo perfectly finished in 1.5 hours!!!!!!!!
Lost client, bad reputation guys. Work on your specialists and on your sales skills too.<//text>

<Review>Christina Ramos is a lousy tattooist. Very unprofessional and all over the place. Don't let her work on you.
I saw her work online and was impressed, even looked cute in the pictures. VERY disappointed!!
IF you value your body I would stay away from her.
Look elsewhere, there are so many good places, this one looks dingy.  Just trying to give you some friendly advise. Don't mean to sound so negative but trust me on this one.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Went here for my first tattoo last night. Was obviously super nervous and had no clue on tattoos at all but everyone in the shop was super cool and welcoming and made me feel really comfortable. Sal did an American traditional rose for me on my forearm and it turned out better than I pictured it in my head. He was also super nice and had some insane stories which calmed my nerves and made the whole session go smoothly! He was also super adamant on the fact that he wanted it to be exactly what I wanted and he resized the drawing per my request and did the transfer twice before doing the outline so that it was angled exactly how I wanted it. I honestly don’t think I could have asked for a better experience, thanks Sal!!!!<//review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
So on Oct Friday the 13 2017 I decided to go get a tattoo from someone I've only known through social media. When I got there it was packed with repeat customers & new one's. As I walked into his station it was like going to hang out with old friend's.  The laughs never stopped & little did I realize couple of hours had gone by. That night I walked away from the shop with new friend's & great tattoo.
If your ever in Hollywood & an itch for some good ink then I suggest you stop in True Tattoo ask for SAL TREVINO.  He takes pride on every piece of art he puts down & if your lucky you will meet his partner in crime The Amazing " Star ".
If you do tell him I sent & enjoy the laughs because they won't end.
Sal thanks for the laughs, good times & great peace of art. True Tattoo it doesn't get any better.. Cheers<//Review>

This place is wack!! Don't waste your time coming here, the as*tard with the glasses denied me service! He said the shop was too prominent to place a tattoo on my arm, are you effing kidding me. Well, I went to Highland tattoo and "Dirt" hooked it up. I took my $600 tattoo business elsewhere! The guy at this shop was rude and lame not patient at all when it came to telling him what I want. This place is OVERATED I went in August 1st on my BIRTHDAY! I left here feeling belittled and disrespected by his comments! NEVER AGAIN!!!<//Review>

<Text>Kenny 'Sharkface' Holland is one of my favourite tattoo artist in the world! He has got me through some intense (placement) tattoos & im so pleased I made the journey from Australia to receive some more work by him. The studio has a great vibe, typical cheeky tattoo artist chit chat atmosphere, I felt welcomed & relaxed.
Thanx again TRUE TATTOO for fantastic tattoo & really great experience 💕<//Text>< Resp>

Dougie Mittz actually did my last tattoo at Shamrock Social Club a few years back. I've been searching for him and recently found out, he is now at True Tattoo. Anywhere Doug goes i will follow. I get compliments on my inner bicep tattoo weekly, Ive had it for about 2 years now its never been touched up once. I will be getting my next piece done end of August (less chance of exposure to the sun) by Dougie and if he is at True thats where i willl be.

<review>I love coming down to this piece of paradise! It's beautiful, it's calming and a couple of times a day you get to wave to the people passing by on the train! This little piece of beach embodies what San Clemente means to me, beautiful, calm, fun! Enjoy<//review>< resp>

<Text>Great parking, snack shack, showers, vistas. The beach itself is clean and easy not find a good spot. 4 stars because once you get into the whitewash, the sand turns to gravel and drops out underneath you unexpectedly in random spots. Will wreak havoc on your feet eventually. That said, still a great beach for family and boarding.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>Went here because this was the only place down by the beach that had food and they deserve all five stars for their service, a good burger & fries. Their hours may vary due to seasons so I was told they close around 5-5:30. Their location nearly pays for itself !< /review>< user_name>

<Text>A nice beach in South San Clemente with (usually) plenty of paid parking and a decent snack bar with a grill. The down side is it gets crowded in the summer and the bathrooms are a little smelly. Otherwise, an easy beach access and waves for the family.<//Text>< GmapID>

A good place to camp in privacy. Enough space for two cars and two tents. There's a table and a fire place with lots of wood lying around. Best part is that this site is walking distance from Castle lake and a bunch of hiking trails. Remember this is not a reservation based site. First come, first serve. There's no fresh water available. But there is a stream passing by. There are a couple of washrooms on site but with no water and hardly any maintenance. Overall a very good camp site with a few amenities.<//text>

Enjoyed *trying* to hike in the snow around Castle Lake in May. Made it .75 miles in before the snow was [still] too much!
Beautiful lake, creeks, and steams in the snow. Saw some researchers from Nevada getting water samples.< /Text>

Great camping spot. Make sure you do the hike up to heart lake. On the way down take a dip in castle lake and siskiyou too!< /review>

Nice lake with camping nearby. It's nothing compared to Heart Lake nearby, though. So if you have limited time, skip this lake and hike to Heart Lake.< /text>

Make sure your car is a 4x4. Ours was not and we got stuck. No signs outside of campground stating this. This was not the worst part. The host , an old troll of a man , was very disrepsecful to our relationship. He was homophobic. He would not address my partner as my wife, he would say " no you won't get me to say that ." He also thought he could comment on our relationship and choices without being asked, and imposed that LGBTQ is a "choice" and continued imposing his dry christian rhetoric. He also told me how wrong I was for pulling a trailer with my car, for traveling, etc. He was an extremely rude host and just would not stay quiet about his personal views, making it very unpleasant for us. It is not right that only straight people can feel safe and welcome at this campground or anywhere! Get a new host.<//text>

<text>Great spot to bring family or just hang out for the day. Close proximity to hiking trails and camping. University Nevada Reno overseas illuminology lab which has the longest running dataset for any lake in North America. There are interpretation panels along the shoreline with information on the lake. This is a great stop for a short trip or an extended stay. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so popular and overrun with people.<//text>< rate>

The only thing I don't like about this place is not all the washers and dryers have the availability to use your debit/credit cards.  The staff are usually very friendly and willing to help.< /review>

<review>The cleanest, safest laundromat I have ever been to!  This is not your typical laundromat, Wash and fold (per pound 24hr turn-around) clean floors, attentive staff. Store with reasonably priced soap, softener etc. if you forgot something. There are multiple locations in San Jose, Campbell.  All stores have an employee during business hours. I have noticed the employees that have been replaced speak little English than the previous employees.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1560987638210, 'text': 'Thanks Frank!'}<//Response><gmapID>0x808f91649c2ab6b1:0xf08041cb8332fd46< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This washhouse is my new place to do my laundry.  It is really clean and has staff there at all times to help. The washing machines are a good price and dryers work well. They have a TV area and snack machines. The bathrooms are nice and clean you have to ask one of the staff for the key. The only downfall is the parking lot is small and I have seen people run into the dumpsters trying to get in or out of the parking space and since they're on the corner of A street  and near BART there's limited street parking.<//Text>

<time>1527901914336< /time><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>This is the cleanest laundry mat i have found in the bay area EVER and clean machines are a plus when you have to do your laundry in a public place... This place is different.  Seriously, we gotta wash our clothes!  They're all germy and yucky-stinky, spilled on- stained fabrics and yes its a terrible thing  but its inevitable! and at OTHER PLACES we sometimes pick things up and take them home with us BUT NOT FROM HERE!  They sanitize and sanitize and sanitize. They keep a keen eye out and approach these potential bandits promptly inside and outside of each machine. And the dryers dry like theyre supposed to so your clothes last longer, smell better, etc etc.  In the big dryers i use 6 quarter's for 3 loads of towels.  Cant beat that!!! 👏👏👏👏  2 thumbs up! 👍👍You're THE best!  You set the standard!  Thank you!</Review><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Very friendly staff. My husband and I were looking for a wash and fold place and we found launderlux online with great reviews. We came in on a Wednesday and they told us about a special they run on Wednesdays which is a $1.10 a pound as opposed to the $1.35(I think this was the regular cost but don't quote me) they regularly have. We dropped it off and they said it would be ready the next day. We came in on Thursday and everything was washed and folded perfectly and we received great friendly service again with a different team there. Great place for wash and fold! It was also very clean. Just remember they don't take card so bring cash.<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Excellent place but with limited parking.

Apart from that the girl keeps the place very neat and has toilets for the users.

They have several seats for customers, it avoids the fatigue of standing.

(Original)
Excelente lugar pero con la limitación de estacionamiento.

Aparte de eso la muchacha mantiene muy aseado elmlugar y cuenta con sanitarios para los usuarios.

Tienen varios asientos para los clientes, se evita la fatiga de estar de pie.< /review></record>

(Translated by Google) I would not give them a star they are very expensive when you arrive you see that it is cheap when you are throwing the coins you charge more for another thing 1 dollar more for heavy according to 25 seats for low is a loss of coming to whom it is very small and the washing machines do not lose your time here I recommend you read laundry is the Megor that there is mega large and very nice people who work there take care of their customers.

(Original)
no les daria ni una estrella son carisimos al llegar ves que es barato cuando estas echando las coras te cobra mas por otra cosa 1 dolar mas por heavy segun 25 sentavos por low es una perdida de venir a qui es carisimo y pequeñas las lavadoras no pierdan su tiempo aqui les recomiendo lee laundry es La Megor que hay es mega grande y muy lindas las personas que trabajan ahi cuidan de sus clientes .<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>The experience is a little different with covid but still overall a great dinner. Things are more packaged and single serve but there was more than enough condiments to go around. Staff were attentive and food came out relatively quickly. They were accommodating with seating when I couldn't fit my 38week belly into the booth. The soft-shell crab basket is absolutely delicious and the serving of extras(potatoes, sausage) is generous. Seating is limited and you have to reserve in person so be prepared to wait a little if you have a larger party.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Good place for eating Cajun style seafood. You can follow steps 1, 2, and 3 for the traditional bag of food mixed with spices or the fried items are good too.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>My wife called several times but got no response so we decided to drive seven miles to the place and pace our order in person. We were in line for about half an hour before our order was taken and was told that the wait time was 15 minutes. My wife got the order ready text after an hour. She was again asked to wait until the cashier's area which was visible from where we were waiting and there was nobody waiting. Finally, my wife was allowed to get in and again waited for more than 15 minutes. Staff were walking around my wife but nobody approached her. Our order was finally handed to my wife after a total of almost two hours. Our orders were already cold, the fries were already limp instead of crunchy. We understand that their reason is about the pandemic, but there must be a better system in place. FYI, The Boiling Crab was our favorite dining place before the pandemic. We go to this place almost once or twice a month and the service was way way better than now. It's very frustrating.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>We had 9 total people including 6 children. Got there at 4pm on Saturday, and waited outside or in the car til 540pm. They seated us at 2 different tables. Friendly staff. Fast delivery of the food. The food was delicious 😋 and reasonable price about 150$ we spent. Great place to eat.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1620758415159, 'text': 'Thank you very much, Melissa! We look forward to seeing you again soon!'}< /response>< GmapID>

I never thought I'd love shrimp this much until I tried it here. It was seriously the best seafood experience of my life! And who knew that shrimp and fries pair well? I recommend this place to everyone!!<//Review>

< Review>
Bad service.  I called several times to order but no answer so we drove to the place.. For a take-out, we waited for more than an hour outside.  The attendant told us it'll take 15 minutes to prepare but it took more than an hour Instead! When I finally received a text message that my order is ready,  the attendant was not attending to me. Instead she attended to other customers who just came. I reminded her that my order is ready but she attended to other things Instead.  There were two of them at the door attending to customers but I don't know why the other one was just standing there and not helping.  I am starving but I lost my appetite...soooooooo disappointed. The food was already cold when we got it.</Review>

My family loved the flavors, the mild spice was spicy enough. Prices seemed steep compared to my last visit before pandemic otherwise it would be 5-star.</Review>

<Review>My first experience here was a good 5 star. But I'll have to drop my rating on my second adventure.
The biggest issue is that some plates just never made it to the table which was unfortunate. Of course those items were removed from the receipt.
The other issue was that the crawfish had basically no flavor. It was very much like it was boiled in water and then just dunked into a bucket of sauce. I needed to dip it in whatever meager amount of sauce was in the bag.
I don't recommend the calamari or softshell crabs. Whatever breading was used simply wasn't very good.
I would only go here for for Crawfish honestly. Just be prepared to ask for extra sauce. Today I took frozen for $9/lb. Fresh was $14/lb.
Compared to other places I've been to where their frozen crawfish just fell apart due to being spoiled and bad, at least this one held together very well.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>It's overpriced, but they have 4 kinds of crab. The seasonings are good.  The appetizers are okay...but the fried oysters were no bueno. No inside dining at the time.  BUT they do text you when your order is ready to pick up.

I went to a similar restaurant in Davis this weekend and I spent $40 less for a similar order and the appetizers were bomb and their menu was larger.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I haven't been here in awhile, it's been some years.  The food was just as I remembered though. I had the snow crab and it was super fresh. Fell right out of the shell. The cajun fries were bomb too. I wish they had a larger drink selection cause I'd love a nice glass of wine with my meal or a cider. Overall, great experience for my first time back in years.<//review><name>Megs<//name>< rate>

< review>
This is one of those restaurants where you need to go casually dressed and all hands in,,,,,because it is messy and you will get some of the spices (and food) on yourself. The servings come out piping hot in a plastic bag (this is where I removed one star - why not have a paper bag) which you dump onto your paper covered table. You use your hands to dig in. I have been to this restaurant about 3 times so far - ordered the king crab legs and gumbo soup once; the Cajun crawfish and sweet potato fries the second and the spicy Cajun prawns the third. The seafood is good - crab of course needs to be worked on - the others less so. I wish they had more flavors than they do but what they offer is good. Usually I go for the Cajun or garlic seasonings and a single order of 1 lb of seafood is enough.<//review>

<review>I love this place! My only con are the long wait times but in my opinion, the food makes up for the wait! I get the fried shrimp basket, a side of steam rice and share sausage from my husband's the whole-shabang shrimp bag! So yummy!< /review>< Pics>

Prepare to  wait  two hours for a table. that's just how it is.  Then pay $55 for 3 king crab legs not counting sides (sides are extra). Not a fan , won't be back. Food is ok. service is good, place is clean< /text>

The Boiling Crab is an amazing seafood restaurant. The prices are very fair for the quality of the food, it being amazing. It is busy most times, but calling in and taking it home is the fastest. The staff are nice and generous.</text>

Best cajun style food you can get in California. I always order more then I can eat. Peel all the shrimp, and crawfish while my hands are dirty. Take leftovers sauce and everything home and put it over white rice. Get your hands dirty!<//Review>

Really painful to throw down $10 for the Michelada but in my opinion it's worth it if you are there for a celebration. They sell the king crab legs by the pound and will not include a 4th leg for an extra charge if you're there with a party of four, they ONLY come in packs of 3 so you'll be required to share the bounty or Fork over another $29 for a 3 pack. Also they bring the food out as it is cooked so don't anticipate eating every plate all together as a family. In my opinion it's better to get stuff that you can share. I would have given five stars if the floor wasn't sticky and the soap dispenser was empty in the bathroom (if you get king crab legs you will be heading to the bathroom immediately upon finishing) also I wish they had an option to give you an extra king crab leg. The food was excellent the portions were great I'll be at the price was a little high.</Review>

THE BIGGEST CRAB in the valley. Definitely love all the crab and sauces here. We drive two hours each way just go eat here. Worth the drive. Great fresh seafood. Love the atmosphere and no one judges when you make a mess!<//review>

So disappointed with the boiling crab. Ordered a lobster as I usually do it was small and no meat!!! No taste no nothing $40 bucks for nothing. The oysters are now $25 for 12 .. what the hell? Last time I ordered oysters they were warm and the last ones I couldn't eat I had to spit out they had gone bad. It used to be good now the times I gone it was a hit or miss. Mostly miss. I'm a great customer! And I will not be going back !</Review>

Awesome food! Seriously, best seafood in a bag, the seasoning is amazing and it's so flavorful. My only concern is that they asked for my ID, which sure they can ask for your ID, but they cannot refuse to accept your credit card if you choose not to show it or even if the name doesn't match. That's per Visa and Mastercards regulations. In CA you don't need an ID to get a credit card. The manager Oscar and even the waitress didn't want to accept my Visa credit card, they asked to see my social media accounts to verify it's me (odd because my full name isn't used) they even stood right in front of the exit end of my booth like I was a criminal going to attempt an escape (my fiance put our 2 yr old in the car and I had my daughter with me). I'm a teacher, I'm not going to lose my career of stupidity. They seemed very unprofessional asking for my social media and I didn't appreciate the service I received just because I left my ID at home an hour away! They also scared my daughter over this whole ID issue. So if you eat there you will enjoy the food, but make sure you bring your ID or they might hold you hostage. I will be following up with Visa about this incident, it's not right. IDs are a way of tracking people, there is no law saying you HAVE TO HAVE AN ID just like you don't need one to get a credit card and I'm definitely going to take this matter as far as I can. Businesses are sued over ignorant things like asking for ID. Look at Gap!<//review>

I have been coming to the boiling crab for years. The weekdays are not bad but, if you come on the weekend prepare for a long wait.
Today was fast,  it was about 5:00pm and we walked in and we were seated right away.
The staff is very friendly and quick to bring our food out.
Being that it was an early dinner I wasn't too hungry. Still, I ate most of my pound of shrimp.
All in all, it was a very comfortable time to come as it was not too crowded.</review>

<Review>Hey what can I say, been going here every year. The same food and the same thing I get. The price are resonable to the food they serve. It may seem unresonable but at least try it, you won't be disappointed. The sauce on the seafood are great. It is thick enough to coat the shrimp and the sauce is good. Its delicious and I'll be going back here every year!!!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

First the staff was so nice, which is a plus. The food was amazing, I ordered the snow crab, frozen crawfish bag with the shabang sauce. The place was bright and live. This was my first time, I will definitely be back soon. My sister got fried catfish that looked so delicious.<//review>

Best sauce.too busy. I like to order the extra sauce on the side to dip with my seafood at home, but they stopped selling their sauce when I went on 8/3/19 :( disappointed when their wait to eat is over an hour. If you have the time and patience to wait definitely worth it.< /Review>

<review>To whom it may concern:
Dear boiling crab or corporate owners,
I used to absolutely love going to the boiling crab but in the past years or so you guys stopped serving fresh sea food. This has been my experience at both locations in Sacramento (the 65th street and k street location). I had stopped purchasing the sea food from the boiling crab and started only buying the “extra juicy” cup of sauce so I can still have the bold flavors of the boiling crab but on fresh sea food I purchased from a reputable source. Now staff is telling me I must purchase the sea food in order to get the sauce. I would have no problem doing this if the restaurant served fresh quality seafood but they don’t serve fresh seafood.Every time I have gotten the shrimp the peel was stuck to the meat and the shrimp was a mushy texture inside. The shrimp I felt a lot like it was boiled frozen and then boiled again . This has happened more than once. To spend close to $20 on a meal just to not have quality fresh food is not ok and this business should not be in operation. Something has to change. You guys need to either start serving fresh seafood or allow people to buy the “extra juicy” cup of sauce. I’ve already yelped about this but am ready to take it to other social media outlets to bring more attention to this problem.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>1</rate>< user_id>

Menu was little confusing at first when you want to get a bag, but service was great, our server explained everything. It's really good food here, beers a bit pricey though... I mean, c'mon, 5$ for a domestic beer, but overall, this place is excellent.< /text>

Super long wait but you can save time by joining the waitlist on Yelp as long as you're within 5 miles from the restaurant. The wait is worth it though! We ordered crab legs and lobster. The lobster costs $45 but it's so good! They only give you 1 shell cracker thingy tho (blue color) so if you're not eating alone you should ask for more of them 😀</text>

<text>This was the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a restaurant. Came in and put our name on the list. Were told the wait would be 2 hours.  We patiently waited outside and checked in every 15mins to see where we were on the list and every time they told us that we had so many in front of us left.  Finally at hour 2 we went back to ask how much longer. And the  host who had been taking names told us that they already called our name and sent a text 1 hour ago. They did not call our name! And not once did they tell us they called our name when we checked in every 15 mins. There was 7 of us standing right outside the door and not one of us heard them call our name.  Instead They had the audacity to try and argue about whether they called our name or not rather than just apologizing. Their system is inconsistent. They sent us a text which we didnt see because they were calling everyone elses names over the intercom or by coming out the door. And not once when we first arrived did they tell us we would receive a text.   I travelled all the way from out of town to try this place and this is how they treat their customers.  Unacceptable. It wasnt until we complained that they magically had a table available.</text><Time>1582520463387</Time></record></dataset><record>

The food is awesome! We would give it 5 stars and be there every weekend if it wasn't for their unorganized seating arrangement, we waited  almost 2 hrs and we lost our table for not moving fast enough to the counter. Service otherwise was great and really friendly.</Review>

This place is totally fantastic. They were extremely busy but the service was very attentive and reasonably fast. It was a young staff but they were very professional. I went there with my wife and one of her good friends. They love Seafood a lot more than me and they were absolutely thrilled with this place. We were visiting the area. Next time we are in town, we are definitely going back.< /Review>

Messiah was awesome and on point give that guy a raise, great food soso prices. would be nice to see one side added to the meals without it being an extra tho, diced potatoes or corn or something should come with an 18 dollar plate of delicious crab legs in my opinion.<//review>

<review>I love spicy food and asked to get a taste of XXX sauce.  The waitress stated they do not give tastes, but would ask the manager.  He said no and we went to Crab City.  What a great choice. First there prices are much better,  second they have more choices of flavors and sauces, and most important I was able to taste the sauce prior to ordering. I chose the hot and it was great.< /review>< pics>

This was my first time coming here and I will not be coming back. We ordered the snow crab. We asked our server how many people it would feed and she said two. My boyfriend is the one who asked about the portion. It's worth mentioning he's well over 6 feet tall and 200+lbs, so his reason for asking should be obvious. When the crab arrived, we got 4 legs and the belly. Nothing else. No corn, potatoes, nothing. I don't know about you but no way that would feed two people. I've never been to a "crab boil" that didn't include sides. We then tried to order some sides the server said the kitchen was closed. Server never gave us a warning. I'm not upset about pricing or the food itself. But I really feel things could have been made clearer.< /Text>

<Review>This place USED to be all the rave. However, I would recommend else where for your crab needs. They no longer do sauce on the side and do not offer 1/2 lbs on market price items. Oysters were to fishy in my opinion and they dont have sriracha.<//Review>< pics>

Small portions and doesn't come with sides that you don't have to pay for. No vegetables or anything. Mussels were good but again the portion was tiny. I'm not a fast eater but I was done before others were halfway through. I think if they offered plates that weren't just fried food I would have liked it. Also lines are out the door but service once inside was good.<//Review>

It was super packed, but that's normal for a seafood place. When you walk in it's too crowded and there's no where to sit or stand. People we're struggling to come in and out of the door due to too many people. Also looked like there wasn't enough tables, so my family and I ordered our food to go. I really wanted to dine in, but better luck next time. As for the food it was great! I just wish I didn't order the Shabang sauce. It was a bit too salty for me.</Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>This place is always busy. My only thing about this place is that they've been giving less sauce. They used to be more generous. Overall though, this place is good and easy to find from the street. Parking can be bad sometimes. I would say also the downtown Sacramento location is better tasting than this one for some reason.< /review>< Pics>

The place is nice and crowded. If you come during busy hours, you have to wait 10-15 minutes. The waitress who served us was nice and friendly. The seafood bag is decent. I really recommend Sha bang sauce. Love King crab legs, but it's pricey (around $29 per lbs, so 2 legs).</Text>

<Time>1538537422030< /Time><rate>5</rate><review>A messy, delicious experience for the whole family. My family of five all had the shrimp, it was served in bags (the restaurant menu states that this is to preserve the flavor of the seasonings) and the amount in each was up to the person ordering. The minimum is half a pound which was perfect for my 8 and 9 year olds. My 13 year old, my wife and myself all got a pound of shrimp each and it was just right. Of course your mileage may vary. You can have the shrimp cooked with a variety of seasonings, but I recommend the whole shabang, it's a tasty mix of all their seasonings. The last decision is if you want your shrimps spicy. My family went for the mild and they all loved it, just enough kick my wife said, I had the medium and it was hot but enjoyable. For those feeling adventurous, they have the XXX level of spicy which according to the waiter, is a 10 on a scale of 1-10.  Anyway, delicious shrimp and a whole lot more seafood on the menu.  Ended up paying about 100 bucks for the five of us with two beers and the kids drinks, plus two orders of fries to share. Not bad at all. Drove from Reno to try the place out and I will go again.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809ac56fa4e33517:0x7e5d76b14f7f8976</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>This place is always packed but worth it. If you can’t make their opening time then be ready to wait in line for 1.5 hours. You can’t make phone reservations but they’re located in a great area that has boba shops and desserts while you wait. Once you place your reservation in-person you can check your wait time by looking at the yelp link provided via text. They’ll give you a 5 minute warning to return back to the restaurant once your table is ready so don’t stray too far. I got the 5 minute warning when I was 12 parties away. I suggest to wait in the front when that happens.

Parking is a nightmare, so I would park within the plaza and walk.

I highly recommend the soft shell crab with fries. I can never share those and always order two for myself. If you don’t want the fries it’s $1 off.

Be wary of the person sitting across from you when they bite into their corn because the sauce will get into your eyes and will burn.

Update:

Went back here on my birthday. They are allowing indoor dinning. I didn’t get the host name but she was super accommodating to my minor time adjustments. Our server Kelly was great too! The food here always hits the spot. I finally tried the sausage. I highly recommend.< /text>< pics>

It’s a good place to eat but when it’s packed there is no parking. And then you have people trying to hold parking spots that’s why I’m giving it four stars. I think they should relocate.</text>

<Review>Food was okay but not great for the price. Long wait. Few menu choices.  Service not bad but not experienced servers. Butter was rancid. No wine only beer. Plastic bags to serve food. Plastic forks. Paper table cloth that serves write on. LOUD. Graffiti for decoration. Kind of tacky really.</Review><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Overall though, this place is good and easy to find from the street. Parking can be bad sometimes. I would say also the downtown Sacramento location is better tasting than this one for some reason.< /Text>< pictures>

So good and spicey. I was afraid this would be a very pricey experience but, after all was said and done, the cost was very reasonable and this style of seafood dining brought back so many awesome memories of my childhood when the crawdads were so plentiful every home in the community was feasting for a week.<//Review>

Been here many times, but this last time I was totally turned off by the food, the crab tasted funny and the manager offered to switch it out but I was not willing to get sick from another batch. The extra juicy sauce was thick and cold! Not at all appetizing! They always seem to mess up "MILD" for "HOT" which sucks because then I can't enjoy my food! It's a hit or miss with this place !</Review>

<Review>This is one of my favorite places to eat seafood with the family. Great atmosphere, great service, I love all the choices. It's a lot more fun when you come with a bigger crowd, but don't let that stop you. If you haven't been, you have to come. If you've been here, I guess I don't have to tell you....lol</Review><name>Omar Jackson</name></record>

<rating>3</rating><review>2.5 stars seems more accurate. My kids have been dying to go here, so we bit the bullet and went tonight. Right off the bat we were excited, because the place was packed we had to wait an hour. Usually a good sign and the reviews seem excellent. Here's what I didn't think was great: the menu was confusing, they were out of Dungeness crab we got the last one, you don't get a meal unless you play almost $10 extra for some corn potatoes and sausage. I got the shrimp, they were whole including the head. I found them extremely hard to eat. Once I did get to them however, the sauce was delicious. The corn was mushy and Soggy but the sausage was pretty good. My wife got the Dungeness crab which was the last one of the day, and it wasn't very good. It was on the small side and some of the meat was tough like jerky or way too fishy. Our waiter was awesome, but for $200 for four people we could do way better on the food. Meh< /review>< pics>

<Text>First timer. They literally bring bags of food and you eat with your hands. No plates, no utensils.  Just crag legs, whole in the Shell shrimp. Good, but I needed a bath when I was done. It was a dining experience. Place was lively, staff were friendly.</Text><rate>3<//rate>< resp>

I've been to two locations of The Boiling Crab now, and this location was just subpar. The location and downtown is far better. I wish I could say better things about this location, the food was just okay, to be honest I didn't even finish my kalamari, my drink, or my shrimp because it just didn't taste very good. The location on K Street is delicious, the food is amazing.<//Text>

This place is really tasty and fresh food. They serve you your food in a bag, so be prepared to get your hands dirty. They are also really crowded on the weekends, so we waited an hour+ to get a table and the service was a little slow as a result. The combo of flavors on the crab or shrimp was excellent, although a little pricey.</review>

Whew!  The service, quantity, and quality is like a more classy, upscale restaurant.  The only thing I would have liked is an actual bar.  However, scale-wise, you get a great bang for the buck in terms of seafood.< /Text>

<review>Great service! GREAT FOOD! Having to wait sucks,no phone reservations SUCKS!! but "it's worth the wait",if have plans to come here give yourself at least an 1hr or 2 for wait,BYOB for the wait or u can do take out if u don't want to wait another thing that stops this place from getting 5 stars is the "no  guarantee wait", on a busy night if u don't get called before closing u don't get in :(<//review>< pics>

<review>It's packed and we were told out wait was going to be 30 plus minutes and they got us in in maybe 10mins. Our waitress is very nice and quick. Food came out very fast and it's absolutely delicious and you can tell it is fresh. Overall, I can say without a doubt that I will be visiting this place regularly.< /review>< user_name>

The food here is usually very good! Getting seated...well that's nearly impossible! Showed up today told 25 min wait with 8 ahead of us...while waiting they opened the other half of the restaurant...after an hour of waiting we were still in 9th position! It's very hard to watch people getting seated that showed up after you did in a restaurant that doesn't take reservations! We left and won't be back! Unfortunately they don't care that we left because they know there will be a steady line of people who are willing to take it!</Text>

<Review>First off, the food was great, reminded me of being back in La. at some of my favorite places. Secondly, to the guy below who was complaining about not being allowed outside food, they have sausages and chicken strips( neither of which are seafood). Prices are market avg. so its seasonal. Admittedly, service could be better, but no one was rude to me or my family.</Review><Rate>4< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x809ac56fa4e33517:0x7e5d76b14f7f8976< /Gmap_id><user>105735568984763242628</user><resp>None<//resp><name>Clay Moore</name><Time>1338766021089</Time>< pics>

This was our usual place we would come from Vacaville but the last time we went they were closed for renovations it would have been nice to know that maybe on their website perhaps.. anyways it's a good crab boil, shrimp is ok the sausage is on point!</review>

<review>I kinda of hate this place. Everything is way over price and they weight your stuff after they cook it so  your also paying for the 40z sauce of your choice. And I honestly dont like I have to render my card information over an unsecured line just to order crab legs then when I come  to pay with my card I have to render my I'd as well. Youll literally spend like 50 dollars here  for one damn Dungeness crab they also dont do call ahead orders so if your coming far  you either have to wait hella long for good for have your food waiting getting cold.  It honestly cheaper to crab boil yourself with these prices</review><user_name>Hennesy Dro</user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>104670539548878685158<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<review>I personally enjoyed the shrimp but overall there's nothing special about their sauces considering it's just heavy on garlic and powdered chili's. I expected a lot more from the chain. Also, since you buy by weight, I do feel like me an my party of 9 received very disproportionate weights which is very hard to argue but was both visibly and physically obvious. Wait was an hour and was not really worth the wait making it ok.<//review>< date>

<Text>Everytime I go and eat here, it's always packed, which is why service is slow. I don't blame them though. The servers are very helpful and patient. Their cajun fries are so delicious! So is their catfish and sweet potato fries. I haven't tried the shellfish and the sauces, but Boiling Crab is known for their bags of shellfish with seasonings.<//Text>< pics>

The best spicy crab around for miles. I drive 35min regularly cuz we are addicted. I promise u will ♥ it!
Only downfall is no outside food/drinks allowed. I always bring my own cold Pepsi & they make me throw it away. I am willing to buy a Pepsi from them so it sucks to have to throw away money to spend a ton of money. They are the only place i go that won't allow my Pepsi. Lame. Food is worth it tho.</review>

Service: It was our first time, so the waitress guided us in terms how to order the dishes. She recommended us to order medium spicy because it was spicy for everyone. But I would prefer spicy because medium was blend for me.
Food- We ordered the dungeons crabs which were expensive. And got one lbs. shrimp the "sha bang style". It has tons of oil in the sauce so if you are health freak not a good place to eat. Over all the food tasted okay with medium sauce.
Price -  Crabs are expensive because of the season.
Restaurant - You cannot use forks and knives here. If you don't like using hands then not the right place to be. You will be given a bib because the hands get dirty and you may spill while eating crabs. Overall food was good. Bathroom wasn't clean and no toilet papers.
Overall experience - Once in a blue moon nice set of place to hang out with friends and enjoy the talks and music in background.</Text>

I got King Crab and shrimp with the whole shaving sauce. Crab was good, sauce is too much for me. Had my stomach upset. I didn't like the shrimp because they was not clean. I dont want to eat poop. Wasted 20.00 because the shrimp came with corn,  potatoe and sausage. Well I had 2 slices of sausage. A little disappointed. I spent a lot and was not happy. Will not be going back.<//text>

<Text>The best spicy crab around for miles. I drive 35min regularly cuz we are addicted. I promise u will ♥ it!
Only downfall is no outside food/drinks allowed. I always bring my own cold Pepsi & they make me throw it away. I am willing to buy a Pepsi from them so it sucks to have to throw away money to spend a ton of money. They are the only place i go that won't allow my Pepsi. Lame. Food is worth it tho.</Text>< pictures>

The food was good, but here's the problems. 1) The order came in multiple trips instead of just 1 trip from the kitchen. 2) We had multiple servers for our table instead of just the server who took our order. 3) The music was blasted so loud I could barely hear anyone at my table. Not recommended.< /Text>

Food is great and staff is always friendly but they have to expand even more and hire more staff...we waited for over an hour to be seated and were finally sat at a table that was empty the whole time we were waiting...</Review>

<Date>1493310640867<//Date><rating>4<//rating><Review>I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The food here is good but our orders kept getting mixed up with another table. Although it was confusing, it worked out and my table got our food. We even received extra food but we decided to be honest about it (not without a few fries and shrimp missing). I would recommend looking into what kind of crab is in season if that's your game but even though you dont' want to pay for king crab, it will be the most bang for your buck. The shrimp was good with only a couple of not completely cleaned ones. That shabang sauce is amazing! The corn was definitely not up to par though.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x809ac56fa4e33517:0x7e5d76b14f7f8976<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Since they changed the ownership or whatever  happened lately,  their food it doesn't taste like before anymore. The taste has changed,  even the to go orders are less on weight as well. I used to be a hard-core boiling crab customer for couple years but not anymore .</Text>

No plates no Tray no buckets, just a big paper towel over the whole table and you eat like a pig. Tried to order some crab legs was not explain that only thing I'm going to get is a bag would half of the crab legs in it. Even though this place is always crowded my experience was not that Pleasant.<//review>

The food was tasty. The plastic utensils broke easily. The service was fairly attentive, but the waitress who described the hottest sauce as Siracha like was wrong. When she was confronted about this and we shared that we were displeased about the one order (out of 5) She refused to remake it and said they could add butter. I will probably give them another shot someday, but the person who was not offered a new dish will never return. Seems like it would have been worth the $9 worth of crawfish to keep his business and have my family and I visit again sooner.<//Review>

It's a popping place. Lots of locals seem yo attend here. Lunch was busy. I though it was ok. The corn is over priced. One is like 1.25, the food was ok. The flavor was ok. Nothing that wowed me really. Like the idea of it and I love seafood, but it wasn't something mind. Also be careful walking outside the doors of the complex goes out and some people can possibly hit you as your walking to the boiling crab. Trust me it hurt lol. The place is large and is good for all group sizes. They offer sausages and rice in our separate from your order. I like to order the corn and put it in the bag to soak the flavor. Try it out. You might like it more than me. 😀<//review>

All the anticipation was for a disappointing meal. I was let down majorly first arriving I really liked it the vibe, music,decor, didn't like the TV's tho they have a bunch of 27 in TV's all lined up instead of big ones idk y . As far as the food it looks better then it tastes. It looks like there's lots of season in it but it's flavorless. Seafood is my favorite food in the whole world . I've are many places in many states so I feel I know what I'm talking about, also I love to eat my shellfish with melted butter and maybe a lil garlic salt or something. So I asked the waiter for sum butter and gross it was pure oil me and my sister are there and had a beer each spent around 90 bucks I wouldn't recommend< /review>< Pictures>

Went there for the first time on Saturday (11/16/2013) and loved it!! Its soooo messy but oh sooooooo good!!! My Daughter and I shared and still had left overs! We got 1 lbs of shrimp, 1/2 lbs sausage and 2 corns in the cajun and garlic butter sauce. All for under $18.00! That was lunch and dinner for us. We cant wait to go back!! =-)</review>

Everytime I went to California I always thought of this place. Last time I visit, they expand the place so is the price. I know its market value but only once I saw the price went down.< /Text>

<Date>1431284369720</Date><Rating>3</Rating><review>This place is for cajun and seafood lovers who have groups of friends that want to join. It's usually a fun time and the food is good. I like the oysters, cajun and sweet potato fries, and whole she-bang shrimp. The shrimp are not de-veined though and your fingers smell like garlic for a while after eating. The wait also makes the experience worse. I think this particular location has worse service than the SoCal ones and it is slightly more expensive. At least its next to vampire penguin so you can get shaved snow after and shop for Asian food beforehand!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Good food but extremely long waits during the weekend. Make sure you put your name down on the waiting list and hang out in the area because it could be a 1-2 hour wait.< /Review>

It's my favorite place.My husband and I drive 2 hours just eat here reason why I give it 4 stars its because whenever we go we have to wait 1 and half to 2 hours because it's always busy.Either than that staff is friendly even when super busy and the wait is worth it but I don't like waiting so long</text>

<text>Wait was shorter than expected.
Dinner made up for that time saved as dinner delayed. Had to get manager involved, part of order was significantly delayed, rest of table done with dinner and still waiting on items that were same as another party at our table. Although a credit was added, extremely overpriced. Similar meal over 150 less at similar establishment and better service.</text><Gmap_id>0x809ac56fa4e33517:0x7e5d76b14f7f8976</Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1623797818124< /date><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

(Translated by Google) Good taste, good price. $ 15 a pound of shrimp. But there is a waiting list, sometimes up to 2 hours or more.

(Translated by Google) It is a very nice place, you just have to go with time because it gets too crowded and you have to wait I don't know if every day is the same but I went on Sunday and it was full we had to wait an hour and a half but it's worth it, the waitresses are very friendly

(Translated by Google) The truth is that this place treated us too badly, we were 16 people who were visiting us for the first time they made us wait for 2 and a half hours, and they told us to wait another 45 minutes for this it was already 8 o'clock at night and they had up to 4 tables alone, but small groups passed the truth that I never go back to this place but we went to the crazy chicken better

(Original)
La verdad este lugar nos trató demasiado mal,éramos 16   personas que lo vicitabamos por primera vez nos hicieron esperar por 2 horas y media ,y nos dijeron que esperáramos otros 45 minutos para esto ya eran las 8 de la noche y abeses tenían asta 4 mesas solas,pero pasaban grupos pequeños     la verdad que nunca buelvo a ir a este lugar    pero nos fuimos al pollo loco mejor<//Review>
