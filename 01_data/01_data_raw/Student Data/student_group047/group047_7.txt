Eating here while traveling on an 18 hour drive was the best choice of the trip. The two gentlemen work were cheerful and helpful. My wife and be indecisive and he helped her get everything she wanted by putting items on the side and offering samples. We were the only ones in the restaurant for a short time and the two staff were talking to each other and seemed to genuinely be enjoyable people. The food was good. We had teriyaki, spicy chicken, and orange chicken. All was well cooked and tasted good. Environment, staff, and food made for an awesome afternoon stop.<//text>

We enjoy to go out. Last night we arrived in this fine place which we didn’t know before. We had a beautiful time there with delicious food and an efficient crew and a distinguished  chef. We put this place in our list  and we will surely return very soon.  Highly recommended.< /text>

My husband and I eat here every time we're in town. Today we had the teriyaki chicken plate. It was fabulous! More than generous! The rice is the best we've ever had. Very, very pleased with the service and the food.</text>

<Text>Great food. Great portions. Fast service. Chicken breast bowl is excellent. Especially  good for counting calories! You can get a regular size bowl with brown rice or all veggies and come out under 500 cal. And be totally satisfied. Get a large and you can take it home and eat it for dinner! Teriyaki sauce is bomb. Hot sauce is bomb. Pot stickers are GREAT! Prices are super low for the portion and quality. I highly recommend....Puts Flame Broiler to shame! My whole crew eats at the one in Santa Clarita at least once a week!</Text>< time>

I go here every so often but as far as Chicken Bowls go, it's far from the best I've had. If you're in the area though and want something healthy like a Chicken Bowl then it's not terrible.

My biggest complaint is the Chicken itself, it's completely overcooked and tough/rubbery and while your choice of sauce covers up some of the dryness of the chicken, you definitely still notice how tough and overcooked it is, the flavor is fine though. Pricing is average, $8-$10 and portion size is good, I usually get the regular size and it's enough to fill me up.

Edit: In response to the owners response:

I just got the regular Spicy Chicken Bowl, I didn't specify chicken breast option but I'm pretty sure I had breast meat, not difficult to discern white meat from dark especially in texture.

I appreciate the response, I'll mention it to the manager next time I'm in about my experience.<//Text>

We decided to come here halfway through a long drive. We weren't sure what to expect since there's not one of these close to San Diego, but we popped in just hoping for some decent grub to refuel ourselves. We were pleasantly surprised! The ability to customize your bowl was a welcomed one as was the variety of meats that were offered! Our table tried the crab rangoons, orange chicken, chicken katsu and teriyaki salmon. All of it was very tasty and fresh! It was obvious that it had all been cooked to order. This is a trip that we will be making fairly frequently and I have a feeling this will be a stopping point on every one.</Review>

I could hardly eat my Tofu Teriyaki. No teriyaki flavor, just deep fried tofu. Not what I expected. Firstly they were out of noodles during lunch time, I then got brown rice, and it was overcooked, sticky. Veggies were bland, just boiled cabbage. Front desk told me veggies include carrots, but didn't see a single carrot piece. This was my first time, will never return again.< /text>

Quality has declined. Been going here for over a year and it was always good up until recently. Today I got a chicken teriyaki bowl and the teriyaki sauce was black and burned so significantly that it was almost a paste. Took one bite and thew the whole thing away. Really bothers me to waste food like that but I could stand another bite. Some serious quality control issues going on because this place used to be awesome.< /text>

Did you happen to let someone know about the sauce?  I would hope this one bad experience doesn't deter you from visiting us again.  Update* we just had the manager report back to me and you were right, the sauce is too thick this time.  We'll have to toss it and make a new batch.  Unfortunately we make everything in house so maybe this time it caramelized too much on the stove....

<review>Very good food, much better flavor than Panda Express. I had the spicy chicken with noodles, and I liked it a lot.  Regular size wasn't enough, I recommend the largest size.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Pretty bomb! They have different amounts of spicy so theres a perfect flavor for everyone. I got chicken with noodles and dumped some of the sauce from the table. I ate it until I was way too full 😝< /Text>

<Review>The staff was not ready to handle the large order they received, as we waited longer for our food than we did waiting in line. Then after 10 minutes, the cashier told us she forgot they ran out of beef, so I ended up getting chicken instead. Instead of a refund, she gave us an extra side of macaroni salad.</Review>< pics>

<response>{'time': 1562115354813, 'text': 'I’m so sorry to hear about this experience you had Victoria...  It’s quite embarrassing that the kitchen didn’t let the front know we ran out of beef.  Everything is cooked fresh so depending on how many bowls you had it might take a little bit to prepare.  But it sounded like you were a very reasonable customer to accommodate last min changes, thank you for that.  Please come back to see us again and let me know how your experience goes.

When we ordered, we asked for cups for water, we were not given any, but we were not worried thinking maybe when they brought the food, but no when she brought us out our chicken bowls, she had no water cups, no napkins and no plastic wear. I again asked about water cups whole my friend went to get forks and extra sauces. When the server came back she had water cups, napkins and forks. The chicken in the bowls we're good, thankfully, my rice was just a tad crunchy. This restaurant will not be on my top 10 list.<//text>< pictures>

Sorry about not being able to reach us during lunch rush... do you have our app or visit our website to place your order? Many of our customers use our online platform to avoid waiting on the phone. When there’s a line out the door especially during lunch sometimes we can’t get to the phone. Hopefully you’ll try placing an order online, and if you don’t come back I totally understand.

The Katsu is one of our popular items since it’s deep fried to a golden color and has a delicious crunchy taste when you bite into one.. definitely not supposed to taste like charcoal!

Currently sitting here waiting on food. 18 minutes since we paid . 3 teriyaki bowls. So 31 minutes later we got our food as I was in line with 2 other people waiting on a refund. We decided to try it. Taste and quality was ok. Frankly the noodles were good but the teriyaki chicken was the Same quality as panda express . The cost for 3 bowls and one order of pot stickers was about 40 dollars. Double what panda would have cost. Needless to say we will not be back.<//text>

Great place to support local! They have a good variety of nuts, fruits, and veggies. They also sell snacks, honey, jams, dried food, dairy products (incl local free range eggs) and yummy treats for dessert. Grab a succulent while you're at it! And of course they're very kind.</review>

You will be overwhelmed by their assortment (see my photos, too). It's like literally getting a taste of the magic of this area. Their prices are incredibly decent and staff most friendly. It's like stepping in a beautiful fairytale, except this one is real. Once you have been there, you will want to go back, even long for it.</Review><user>105690232191229458436<//user>< response>

Bought a pound of raw walnuts at the Fort Mason Farmers Market two weeks ago.  I thought anything at a farmers market should be great, fresh, better than you get at a supermarket. Also like helping out producers directly instead of Whole Foods etc. Sad news to say the walnuts were completely flavorless.  Worse than bland.  Tried toasting them for a sundae.  Still completely without flavor.  Never again from this place.</Review>

This place is a hidden gem. Yes, if you don't live in Winters, this is not exactly "on the way" anywhere, but it's definitely worth the visit if you can stop by. There are lots of fresh vegetables, fruits, and other things that are super tasty. My favorite was the spicy dried mangoes, which didn't even make their way home, because they were consumed in the car.</text>

<resp>{'time': 1562790054064, 'text': 'Hi William, if you are not satisfied with your purchase we can do refunds/exchanges. Unfortunately apricots are at the tail end of the season right now (old fashioned varieties are out of season) and tomatoes are barely just starting in the area due to the bad weather (climate change and rains in May). Pluots are currently in season which might explain why they were good. As an agricultural business that relies heavily on the weather, seasons and varieities, we understand some products might not always be satisfactory. Thank you for your feedback.'}< /resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I'm quite angered at the fact that the manager of the store who was my cashier, charged me for stuff I didn't even buy nor want. For some reason I was billed for a PCV valve I didn't even have and I was billed for fuel system cleaner he was promoting even though I said I didn't want it. I brought this to his attention and he did give me the refund but still it's the principal. The audacity one has to charge people for some extra sales to boost his year end bonus, that's not ok. I definitely won't be going back.< /Text>< Pictures>

Awesome, helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly staff. Had an issue with a set of new headlights I purchased at this location and they replaced them for me with little effort on my part. Would recommend this AutoZone 100% for all your automotive needs.<//Review>

<user_name>Khamid Bakhadirov< /user_name><date>1562722020049<//date>< Review>
Loved hiking here.
Difficulty: It’s a challenging hike as it’s constantly goes uphill.
Parking: very limited. 2-3 spots next to entrance and on the side street.
Bring: water, sunscreen, hat
Amenities: trail map, porta-potty, beautiful views
Shade: very limited. It’s a very sunny hike. Probably best visited in winter.
Dogs allowed: yes!!!
Other thoughts: you won’t see to many people here. It’s a quiet hike.
Like my review if it was helpful!</Review>

There is not much parking here (only 3 spots) but the trail is really nice. You need park on the side of the intersecting street.< /review>

All the way down on return. In and out same way, not a loop. Great views on a clear day. You can tailor it to you length. First split at the ridge is 4 miles up, you can make it a 8 mile hike. Or further up down slopes of 2 miles will make it 12 miles round trip.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I think this place is a hidden gem, serene scenic and if you do the hike to the Ridgeline it can kick your butt. What I like about it most is that it's less trafficed, which means you can really enjoy the hike instead of trying to focus on getting around lots of people. The views are absolutely stunning, you can see mountains of diabolo range and once you go over you can see the Santa Cruz mountain towards the south. Cherry on top is that parking is free(depending on if you are lucky)< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>There are only 2 assigned parking spots. You need park on street side if you are going to Kennedy hiking trail. There a place for 10 to 12 cars on street side.

This has got to be the best dispensary by far! The staff is very knowledgeable, kind and helpful!!
Best inventory as well, I went in looking for something to consume and was met with edibles, tea, cooking oil. I bought the tea and oil in which I love! The staff wears their mask throughout the entire transaction and enforce masks to be worn by customers as well. Overall I loved my first experience there and I have found my permanent shop❤️< /review>

< Review>
I've been with these guys since the times behind the cheese shop down the street. Still a great staff and great selection (especially concentrates) but sadly these days you pay the "hipster/fad tax" Prices now are about 15-20% too high. They are starting to rely on promos to move stock but even promo pricing is becoming outside competitive range.

I miss the old hole in the wall WEED.<//Review>

This is pretty much the only dispensary I frequent. The staff are always super nice and friendly, selection is fine for what I need. Knocked off a star because an employee assured me 100% an edible was vegan, but after purchasing and looking at the label, it was not. I'm not vegan, but I do have a milk allergy, so I found this a bit concerning. I check the labels myself now, but perhaps better training for things like this since allergies can be deadly.<//Review>

<text>My absolute favorite dispensary. Great selection of products; they always have exactly what I want, need, and more. The STAFF, though...the NICEST, friendliest, most knowledgable and helpful people ever. Rebecca, Marcus, etc...all so so good. Can't/won't shop anywhere else! ps I'm excited to try the new products Marcus introduced me to today - THANK YOU!!!!</text>< Resp>

<Review>Brandy with the last name starting with an R was absolutely amazing. I had called in to ask a couple of questions in regards to the law since I was moving back to the state. Not only did she answer questions but she was patient kind and respectful. I really enjoyed talking with her she was quick to the point and didn't take overly extra amount of time or words to explain things to me. Thank you so much for taking the time to chit chat with me. I appreciate you answering my questions< /Review>< Rate>

<Time>1606403487200< /Time><rate>1<//rate><review>I was told they charged no fee to use debit card . He told me the total was 53$, placed a $60 charge on my card , then gave me $3.50 back. Then I got charged an extra 2.50$ on my bank statement! This is Blasphemy , a debit card pulls available funds out of a bank account . I understand if they want to charge me for the transaction of using a debit card for 25 cents or whatever but not $7!!  Plus I was told a certain item wasn’t manufactured anymore which was not true . I felt like I was taken advantage of and will not be going to this shady place ever again especially because the 2 types of edibles I bought were 10% more expensive than the two other stores I called after . Either get people who are competent and not too high while working there or you’re going to have a lot more issues .

Under new cooperate management and continue to make changes for the worse daily. Started charging you for a bag even if you brought your own, which discourages people from bringing the bags back in and defeats the whole purpose of the reusable bag system. Started raising the price on products that are a consistent industry price just because they have a good location. Shame on you for not caring about your patients anymore.</Review>< pics>

You know it's going to be a great experience when you are meeting like minded people in the parking lot going in😂 We were visiting from Switzerland so had never experienced anything like it. Can't remember the girl that helped us( go figure lol) but she made it well worth the trip( I do remember she had dark hair.and glasses.. I dunno. 🤣) Highly recommend!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>From the feeling I get, everybody here is here not just to sell product, but to sincerely listen to you, and give you a true appraisal of what they see your needs are, and dispense whatever they feel is appropriate. They are not there just to sell you some product and quickly move on the the next customer. On my 1st visit, I worked with Autumn, who was SO patient, so full of information and personalized advice, and showed sincere interest in my personal needs. Combining those attributes with her obviously  well-developed extensive knowledge, made it such a positive experience. Autumn advised me---because this would be my 1st experience with cannabis, to start conservatively. We decided to see how it worked out and take it from there. I am so glad I waited while she finished her lunch break! This was at the end of December.
Today, Jan. 28, I was help by Nicole. First of all, she is such a nice person, and is also there to listen to me tell her what I was there hope that a cannabis product could do for me. She was also was very patient in hearing me out, and then to thoughtfully tailor what she thought my needs were at this point. She did not try to oversell, but to the the contrary had me obtain smaller amounts of product so that I can see how they work. she was a pleasure to work with.
This is a really good store, and I highly recommend you try them out.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>The first dispensary I ever visited in one of my trips to California to see family. I've traveled back 3 times since and The Weed is always my first stop. I usually fly in on red eye flights. As  soon as I wake up, I call an Uber and go straight there. I stay in touch by signing up for their texting information. Planning another trip early New year, can't wait to THC you at the weed again!<//Review></record>

<Text>This place is just plain great. Customer service is number one. They have call lists so you know when certain products come in. Everyone working is super knowledgeable about everything- the last time I went in I learned about different scent profiles in different strains. Like...what?! This place is my number 1 dispensary forever.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Bought out by a greedy evil company.
They’ve stopped supplying the other day 1 oz packs properly and have them for less than half a day.  They’ve raised the price on everything, and the weed costs nearly 3 times more than it used to a few months ago.

Project cannabis is ruining the weed business.< /Text>

The WEED was the the best dispensary I have experienced. Everybody was very attentive and helpful especially Eli who served us with a beautiful smile and tons of knowledge answering our questions with clarity! The prices were by far better than our last dispensary, (that we called our go to) right down the street. I highly recommend this place which is now our go to place.</Review>

<review>A little long but worth the read.

In the past I would have given this dispensary a 4 star but the most recent experience has lost me as a long time customer.

I purchased a $50 bottle of CBD tincture only to have the plunger malfunction a couple weeks after I purchased it. It happened while the bottle was packed in a hygiene bag during travel and the entire remaining contents, about 80%, leaked out. The plunger portion on the cap came out of its grooves that hold it in place. I used the product just fine for the 2 weeks before so it just wasn’t designed well enough to handle being packed for travel. I’ve had plenty of success with other manufacturers packaging. This item was made by Care by Design and I will not be using them again.

I returned it to the store to show them and I expected a replacement and even offered to pay for the 20% that was used. They refused for the moment until they could contact the manufacturer. Three weeks later and still no follow up from them so I stopped by and left my number again and a follow up with one of the employees. A week later now and still nothing. No follow up or anything. I even have a history in their computer of long time customer loyalty but that didn’t make a bit of difference. Even told them this incident will determine if I continue to be a customer there and still nothing. I expected more from this establishment.

CBD has only medicinal value, no high, so it boggles my mind that they have sub par customer service in a medical industry. Hate to say it but as a paying customer I’ll be going with the highest quality product (to include packaging) and reliable customer service out there and I’ve since moved my business to Urban Treez down the street.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Out of Stock is a phenomenon we probably all have experienced sometime in the course of our lives and it is never a pleasant incident; it is even less so for those responsible for it.

Retailers and manufacturers suffer huge losses every year because of empty shelves and disappointed customers. Damaged reputation and customer loyalty, decreased impact of promotions, and higher costs for re-ordering all multiply to millions, if not billions, of dollars lost.

But also late deliveries, under ordering, and not having clear responsibilities for inventory lead to empty shelves fairly quickly.

In order to really tackle the problem it is, therefore, essential for retailers and suppliers to coordinate their procedures and information sharing.  The Wellness Earth Energy Dispensary has major issues keeping RSO or Rick Simpson Oil product on shelves. Unfortunately, sick people cannot afford to have an unreliable retailer, especially with their medicine. Hopefully, their management team realizes the customers that they are losing and corrects this ineptitude moving forward.</Review>

I do believe this is the best dispensary in Los Angeles! I've been in many and none of them compare to the w.e.e.d.
The variety of products and quality are amazing. The professionals working there treat you kind and fast.
For me the cherry on top is CBD SUNDAYS!!!! the discount is awesome!!!! I love it!!!
Keep up the outstanding work guys!!!!!< /Text>

It's  a dispensary with friendly, respectful and caring bud tenders. Just the right place to go if you are in need of the best meds for the right price. Not to mention it's without a doubt the one dispensary with the most strains, edibles,  concentrate, etc...MUST CHECK IT OUT AND EXPERIENCE THE BEST IN TOWN!!! Even If driving from Delano California< /review>< userid>

Came here to get some CBD for my grandpa. Huge selection, knowledgeable staff, but a bit on the pricey side. I would still recommend this place to anyone in the area. They have a variety of daily specials. Cash only.< /text>

They staff is nice and the products they offer are second to none. They don't have a giant selection of flower, but what they do have is super high quality. Lots of wax and vape products too. Also, probably the widest range of edibles I've ever seen.</Text>< pics>

Went with a friend that wanted pain options. Expensive, noisy, & obviously at least to me commission based sales staff.  He bought some sleep & pain relief products.  To me it was like visiting a carnival arcade< /Text>

<review>Amazing dispensary I go all the time! They allways have the best deals on wax and they have a great  variety of wax to choose from. And everyone try's to be as friendy as they can be so its all was a happy and fun environment so if you love wax and good people come here

Update: very overpriced recently I still love the staff but I haven’t been there in a while so that’s why I have to update< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

It would be alot better if they kept the 50 mg ABX thc capsules in stock . I mean it's not like they won't sell it if they can't keep it in stock. Maybe order double so it doesn't run out in 1 day.< /Review>

< review>
I really loved this place, it has the best budtenders and it's a classy spot, however they have switched to prepackaged meds, not good.  I purchased my meds the other day and the entire order was extremely DRY. The flower crumbled like kief it was so dry and that applies to all 4 8ths I purchased, especially the mega glue, it was like powder. I live too far to return it so I was stuck with my purchase.of dry flower and was extremely disappointed. I have never felt this way here.  Im going to try them again this weekend, because like I said, they have always been great but if its dry again I'll have to find another dispensary and I really hate to have to change.< /review>

< Review>
This place has a good selection of quality flower and edibles, but what stands out is the insane selection of concentrates—including some good and inexpensive shatter and sugar wax made locally and cut right off a sheet or scooped out of a tub by weigh.

There's a small parking lot, which The W.E.E.D. shares with a crossfit gym and Vendome Liquors but there's now free valet, so it's not usually an issue. The place has a pretty hip decor with lots of framed Shepard Fairey prints on the walls. Waiting room is spacious with plenty of seating, some T-shirts for sale, and an ATM. I've sometimes had to wait but never for very long. First-time patients register on a computer in the waiting area.

Always a handful of knowledgeable budtenders working at any given time and they're good about letting customers know about deals and specials.<//Review>

<Time>1464023749964< /Time><rate>1</rate><Review>Totally overrated. Cannasutra down the street is way better and cheaper, also more discreet.. The WEED is a circus. They fired amazing knowledgeable people on multiple occasion because they believed they were stuck up (and believe me they weren't..) Then followed that ridiculous move and hired young ignorant chain cigarette smoking millennials with they're pants sagged around they're asses while having underwear three quarters of the way exposed? Foul!! They Literally went from classy employees, to punk 19-21 year old young millennials, they had zero knowledge of the medicine they were recommending. The fired great employees, meanwhile due to they're priceless experience and knowledge they have went on to work for HighTimes and many other amazing reputable cannabis businesses and product companies.. How moronic of an business owner to hire those little boys over grown up mature knowledgeable genuinely good adults. Which still hold a great reputation locally regardless of this places bs they pull on patients an employees. No surprise and they now work at better collectives and have opened my eyes to the fact that a great budtender is actually what makes a shop here on Ventura great, it's all about informed recommendations.< /Review>< pics>

They only allow 2 people inside at a time, and there was already one person at the counter. I stood inside for 10 minutes without any acknowledgement from the cashier or the other staff in the background. Not one single person asked if I had been helped or tried to ring me up. You can't operate with only 2 customers? What a joke.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>The service was as great as the people that work there.  I already did the research on the internet but when I was there the manager explained in detail what every feature did and how it would work for me in my line of construction.   Top of the line technology for sizing up your foot and how you step so if you like can buy the proper insole inside your boots so you can have comfort knowing your feet will be working while your boots will be working for you.  Great 5 star all around experience.< /Review>< resp>

They have the bet selection of work boots, shoes as well as women's work boots and shoes with protective toes. Some even have bedroom slippers with non-slip thick soles.  Very comfortable!</Review>

Nothing worse than young hispanic employees being racist and judgemental towards thier own kind. Did not want to help him, refused to speak spanish even though he could and did with other customers. Good thing my husband cared more about getting his boots than customer service and the lack of help the first guy offered. If people are willing to drop that kind of cash on your product at least show some kind of freaking customer service. 5 people in the store and we were the only ones who bought something.<//text>

I would say a wonderful store, fair prices and very personable people with honest conduct. Very accommodating in regards to religious purchases and will give great deals in regards to that and more. There seems to be a personal vendetta against the store with 1 star reviews as they seem to have no relation to what I have experienced at all</Text>

I love ❤️ this place because they have all kind of variety and all brand name products e.x Laxmi Dhanraj and more brand . believe me guys when I cook my lentils and rice 🍛 the taste came up so good. It’s worth spending money. And the owners are very nice and polite they help me a lot to find everything ❤️. They are providing you everything and specially  in L.a who wants to drive so far . I m so happy I m getting everything fresh and clean. This is such a good store ❤️❤️❤️< /Text>

<text>This owner sold me 10 lbs rice bag for $19.99 and the rice is just basic brand not premium kohinoor brand or something. He just rings up the price on computer. I think he just asks customers where are they from or if they are new there. Once he knows it's their first time, he charges them A LOT. Why don't they have prices on items on shelves? Shady. Worst experience.

Neither this store is clean nor packed with quality products, SO WHY IS THIS THE MOST EXPENSIVE INDIAN GROCERY STORE? Can the owner explain that?

To the owner -
And don't reply that I am lying. I just got rice nothing else. I checked prices with other Indian grocery store, they told me you charged way extra. I have my receipt and I'll not hesitate to come and talk if you deny it.

For the people who are giving 5 stars to this store, PLEASE VISIT OTHER GROCERY STORE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF.
ALSO, I FOUND BEST INDIAN GROCERY STORE, IT'S in San Diego county (if you're going to drive). It's called 'Miramar Cash & Carry'. It's like Indian Walmart with best prices and excellent quality products.

I AM NEVER GOING TO THIS STORE IN L.A. EVER AGAIN.< /text>< Pictures>

Had a very disappointing experience... it was poorly stocked... on top of that, a lot of things provided were expired.. the person at the counter seemed uninterested even when we pointed out that the products were expired... i would not recommend anyone visiting this place... please do not even keep it as a last resort...<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>I must say, i have had good experiences while purchasing a few things in the past, id really only purchase an or two items at a time. Prices always seemed fair, especially for a small shop like this. However, last time I went in I was on the lookout for several spices to make Masala Chai. Always as helpful, i was led around the shop picking what i need which was great. They showed me my options when they had them and gave me recommendations. When i was finally done they gave me a quick rundown on how to make the Chai as i am a total noob to any of this and finally rang me up.  When i saw the register ring up $81.93 ( which was directly inputted at the register, like if he had been adding up the prices as we were picking the spices, just thought ok he's good with numbers), for some spices and some black tea I was in disbelief. My ignorance coupled with disbelief led me to just pay the bill and walk out the door scratching my head. I didn't want to believe i was taken for a fool as they seemed so friendly and knowledgeable. My thought " why would they want to screw over customers, especially in this economy? I'm sure this is how much everything costs." But the following day was time for me to do Grocery shopping and realized that my grocery store sells Sadaf brand spices which the Indian shop was proudly selling as one of their top brands. Naturally i added the prices of all the same spices and tea i bought at the indian shop including taxes to a sum of a little over $30?!?!?! I definitely feel ripped off tho. What makes this more peculiar was my visit prior to this. When i arrived at the shop the lady was happily explaining things to a couple of a customers, but I believe they were speaking in hindi so of course i didn't understand. But when they were checking out i noticed they were only walking out with one standard size supplement (that i had no knowledge about) bottle yet they were charged a very similar price to what i was charged my following visit. The customers were also surprised, but paid and walked off in the same disbelief.
They are friendly and very helpful, but be careful. Most of their items don't have labeled prices so question the price of everything prior to getting it to the register. They've caught onto the idea that people are much more willing to pay an obviously outrageous price while at the register (having had their emotions preyed on as they explain benefits and what not) rather than if they'd simply pick up the item and asked for the price.

I don't see how this tactic is worth it for them, anyone who walks out with any doubt on what they purchased will most likely just do a check on google for it. They certainly lost one customer.< /review>< UserId.>

Awesome place! The owners are so helpful and kind. My mom said, " They are making me want to come back and I haven't even left yet!! They have great service!!". Definitely worth the trip from San Fernando to this place.

P.S. Yes, they do have fresh Curry leaves<//Text>

Every spice, sauce, and dry good you need for a real indian meal at home. The workers even offer great recipes if you ask! It's a hole in the wall for sure, but the best places always are. They accept ebt! It won't break your budget, but it WILL treat your tastebuds. Even the box masala mixes are heaven. Don't miss this place. Trust me.< /text>

<text>I went to the store in a rush to get some coconut oil and soap, Mani (the owner) was very friendly and helpful. He saw my acne condition and recommended some Ayurvedic medicine to me. He also told me what to do and what not. .I wished I had more time to explore all the products in the market. While I was there, Mani was also helping the other two customers. I saw him holding the shopping basket for them and answering all their questions while helping them choose the products.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2974720cd1bcd:0x6784b97fe5b0f961</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>This is my favorite Indian store in van nuys. Superb customer service, very warm nd welcoming store owners. Unlike other Indian stores, royal India spiceland is neat nd clean store.
They have saved my trips to losangeles
As I can get everything here. It is very conveniently located. They carry all the products nd Ayurveda herbs nd oils for long hair.,prices are reasonable Nd spices is very fresh and the owners provide u all the recipes if u need. They gave me a recipe for chicken tikka. I made my chicken tikka with same recipe. It came out so delicious same taste like restaurant style.

<review>I went to the store in a rush to get some coconut oil and soap, Mani (the owner) was very friendly and helpful. He saw my acne condition and recommended some Ayurvedic medicine (Safi herbal drink) to me. He also told me what to do and what not, and what other things I should take after the 21-day treatment. I wished I had more time to explore all the products in the market. While I was there, Mani was also helping the other two customers. I saw him holding the shopping basket for them and answering all their questions while helping them choose the products. Mani kindly gave me his contact information and told me to ask him if I have any question with the medicine, and he would help me consult with his Ayurvedic doctor in India should my condition not improve.</review><response>None< /response>< name>

I wish I could give zero stars! I hardly write reviews but I had to write this. I called this place to buy a copper lamp for navratri. They said they have one available and I asked them to keep it for me. When I went there around 8.45 PM before they close the shop, I found that the price on the lamp was $39.99!!
They changed the price tag because I called them and asked them that I am going to buy it!!! Later I came to know that the same lamp was available for $11.99 at another Indian store! This is sad and disappointing.
I have been to the stores couple of times and I used to go there from Burbank. It is obvious and clear that they took an advantage of a person who called them about the lamp and asked them to keep it aside in advance.They not only tripled the price but told me they won’t charge taxes as it is for God’s work!!! They acted extremely suspicious during billing. If you go to any Indian store the lamp is priced around $11.99 & they charged $39.99 for the lamp just because I called them and told them that Navratri is starting from tomorrow so I will quickly come and buy the lamp. Even amazon is selling the same lamp ranges $10 to $15!
I was in rush and in urgent need as the Navratri was starting next day and could not wait for the delivery time! I can’t post the picture on Google but I have posted the picture of the lamp on yelp. You can google the price!
After what they have done to me and rather than asking about the situation they tried  to put the blame on some other (me being from some competing) store is extremely shameful.
To the owner,
I am not from a competitive store. I am a student and a medical professional from india and please put your act together. I called in advance because I didn’t want to waste my time searching for the lamp and go to different Indian stores to find it is not there. I hope you reflect upon your action and realize that it is less about money and more about values and ethics. I trusted you so I bought the lamp
from you. Don’t do this to people!<//Text>

Parking garage right next to the restaurant. Hand the ticket to your waiter at the end of the meal and they will validate it and knock off $6. Make your moneys worth and walk across the street to Grand Central Market.< /Text>

Farfalla food is good, altho the "light cream sauce" was not light at all, and there was too much of it. Bigger. Issue is it's way over-priced. $81 (before tax and tip) for two glasses wine, one salad and two of the least expensive entres on the menu. Not OK.<//Review>

This place is fantastic and the service is great. The prosciutto pizza is probably one of the top 3 pizzas I've ever had. This place is a hidden gem in a plaza area. I highly recommend it<//Review>

<Review>Great place for lunch or dinner. Service is good and the patio is extra large! They have daily specials, the fresh Cod is prepared with olive oil and was cooked perfectly. You have a variety of sides, the broccoli and carrots were fresh and also well prepared. Definitely one of the better restaurants in Encino.< /Review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Went to lunch, and all though the waiter is helpful coming around multiple times to see "how is everything?" It was distracting. We we're in deep conversation and just interrupted more so than checking on our table as a waiter. He could quietly pour the water and leave when he sees us in conversation. Food was tasty.< /review>

He is rude, doesn’t care about the customer, and only interested in their money. We were a large group for a birthday dinner,  service was slow, they messed up on our group’s order but I didn’t think it was a big deal.  However, we forgot our sons T-shirt at the restaurant and when my wife called the owner an hour after we left, the owner said he’s busy and can’t look for it. Then he just told her to call back Tuesday and hung up on her. I called the restaurant back and they kept saying he can’t talk, they can’t look for the shirt now, they are busy. We spent so much money at the restaurant and that’s the courtesy they give us. They made no effort what so ever to attempt to locate our sons favorite t-shirt. Truly disappointed and will never dine there again.< /review></record>

I take my employees to this restaurant every month to celebrate anniversaries.  Every single experience has been a great one- the staff are extremely attentive/responsive.  The owner- always concerned about providing a superior culinary experience.

An example- an employee thought something was too salty, so she didn't really touch her meal, but was uncomfortable about saying anything since she has little tolerance for salt.  When the owner saw it come back to the kitchen, he was genuinely concerned becuase she didn't tell him so that he could make her something else right away.

The crusts of the pizza are perfect- light, tender, with the lightest crisp.  The ingredients- clearly high quality.

We are NEVER rushed- the staff recognize a speedy lunch and the desire to lounge.  Great all around.< /Text>

This was my first dining at this restaurant and it was not the best experience.  We requested to be seated outside, but could smell the smoke from others who were not smoking in the restaurant, but on the side walk next to the main entrance.  I ordered the chicken picata (spelling?), and the taste was decent, but at 1:00 a.m. the complete dinner I spent $50 on that evening came up and out of me.  Today I still feel a little lousy.  Our waiter wasn't the best waiter.  Overall, it was disappointing and a waste of my money,</text>

Very tasty Italian food. Nice choices on the happy hour. Good pizza. The Fettuccine Bolognese and the Lasagna are 2 of my favourites . The Linguine Puttanesca  is not on the menu but if you know to request it, it might come served in a Parmesan wheel which is divine !

Michele was the most attentive of servers,  but he's not there anymore. So service is ok.<//review>

Horrible. Stopped going here all together. Not enforcing masks for customers or employees and people cram in there with no care for others well being. There are two other smoke shops on Mono way that are doing their part to protect people and don't have rude employees.</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I just got totally insulted in the Sonora smoke shop. I went into buy some CBD and was told they were going to sell it to me because it was only for their “regular“ customers. Do you know how much money I’ve spent in the Sonora smoke shop? My husband buys his cartons of cigarettes here almost every other week! I’ve actually recommended this place to other friends to get their CBD here! Just be careful if you’re not a regular or you may not be welcome. How insulting! There are other smoke shops in the area.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Went here tonight and got asked for my ID I gave it to the man who was helping me. He said I don't look over 21 and he can not sell anything to me because I don't look 21!!! I'm 29 witch my ID says that is all you need to know.  The place looks like it has nice glass  but the customer service is terrible.  Obviously I'm never returning here.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

The placement of the Booth is very bad. I hurt my elbow real good, suggested the cashier to take care of it but they didn't respond much. I am sure someday someone will get hurt and this they will end up paying a lot of money.<//review>

This is our first time at this location..we’ve also been to the Moreno Valley one. Great food, service and atmosphere! I had the Shasta Scramble and my husband had the Joe’s Hobo omelette. Delicious!! All of the team members worked well together and helped each other out which was nice to see! Keep up the good job guys!< /Review>

Nicely decorated with Bear and Country theme. Airy open spaces in the main dining room. I ordered the Bigfoot Country fried Steak which comes with soup or salad, yummy cornbread, meshed potatoes and fresh veggies. I thought the steak was overly tenderized, it has less a steak texture, more like a burger pattie.</Review>

My friend and i were there today.  But ive been many times before and food is always delicious.  Very large menu with lots of choices. We had the chicken fried steak.  A nice surprise was the green beans with ham. Yummy.  Had a great waitress. Sorry I didnt catch her name.  I see they are featuring what looks like a delicious carrot cake in April. So will be back soon!<//Text>

This was the worst dining experience ever. First there was no one available to greet us and seat us. There were other people waiting and ended up leaving as well. When our order was finally taken, the waitress had to go back cause she didn't know the soup. When we got our food it was super cold.<//text>

Our waiter Josh went above and beyond to make or dining experience great.  We had a small wobble on out table and he literally got on his knee to fold a place mat and fix it . The couple behind us only spoke spanish and he tried so hard to communicate with them . It was great all the food was delicious but the service is the reason I would come back</Text>

My family and I checked for a seat and the host just looked at us in digust . No good morning or anything. I asked how long is the wait she replied 35 or 40 with no smile or nothing.  I felt that this restuarant maybe didn't need my business  so went to Brandon's where I had a great experience. Date  April 1 at 1100 am. Please train your staff not to judge people.< /review>

<Review>Black Bear Diner has re-opened its dining room with C19 protocols. The Bear Claw filled with blackberries is very good, just the right amount of sugar, not overly sweet.

< Review>
Moved here from miami florida about 2 years ago.food choices were somewhat limited but delivery restaurants were very good.i told many ppl the food here wasnt that good.i passrd by blackbear diner many times .when i finally tried it.well.the food speaks for itself.by now..ive tried many different things on the menu.every entre they have available ,not including the steaks cuz i dont they travel well.like a hamburger.but anyway.everything ive tried on the menu is just amazing.its all incredible.i should have known.everytime i did a visit to perris .right next door was a black bear diner.and the good smelled so good.i would ask ppl if they ever ate there because it smelled so amazing.im so glad i finally found blackbear diner.it must be all completely homemade.fantastic food.espcislly the pies a nd the potroast.i was literally gonna stop in there and thank them.personaly.< /Review>

<Text>Food was good. Had turkey pesto sandwich, tri tip dip (make sure to add grilled onions & Swiss cheese). Also tried the biscuits & gravy, huge portion just needs more gravy. Both sandwiches were delicious. We'll come back to try different stuff on menu, just maybe not the biscuits & gravy sorry. Went back and tried the grilled chicken & pesto pasta it was pretty tasty.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Love this place!!.

It recently opened a few months ago, I love the fact that is 5 miles away from home and I don't have to drive all the way up north to get My Black Bear Fix.

- On our first visit on a Tuesday for lunch Hailey was our server and She was just great at explaining everything on the menu.  That day We had a New York Steak and Tri Tip with Veggies, the quality and flavor of each dish is A+

- Three weeks later We came back again and ordered another Steak, Handbreaded Chicken Breast with veggies and again another A+

Every time We were near a Black Bear diner either on the i99 or in Vegas, We try to stop and eat there. Now that they open quite close to my home is just great!..< /review>< pictures>

Very poor quality food.. I ordered a BLT and it was ONE  slice of burnt bacon broken up in four pieces on the sandwich.. I refused to pay 10$ for that.. my mom also had to send her fish and chips plate back.. the fish was obviously reheated and vegetables were definitely from a can.. we left without eating.. the Moreno Valley location is 1000% better</Review>

The pancakes will make you cry from happiness. It's never a disappoint when we go and the hosts are ALWAYS really into making your meal great.

I look forward to the fall and winter the most because it's just freaking cozy as hell during that time (especially rainy days) but don't let summer pass by if you wanna enjoy the backlot experience!

Bring your appetite!< /text>

<Review>The food was okay. The service was okay and nice and friendly. Easy to find on Mountain Avenue south of the 60 Freeway. Great location. The neighborhood is good. The parking was okay. The price was okay. It was not too dirty there  and clean.🍝🍴🍳</Review></record>

<Text>Nicely decorated with Bear and Country theme. Airy open spaces in the main dining room. I ordered the Bigfoot Country fried Steak which comes with soup or salad, yummy cornbread, meshed potatoes and fresh veggies. I thought the steak was overly tenderized, it has less a steak texture, more like a burger pattie.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU4dLRyT6yEbkT3Kv_yBT7hajx_keHy_qG1Lwm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB3EOZ7cMClqKcwRlb8T47mOBAflP-jZXq0Jxx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9IUEExE1SEVl_oGH_Sraja0CWnfHxz6N6iDBH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg56YT-gnmJjrxklTZ-EvkejJI-z0ohbJtJO_o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnHSRNNshdHKylJupnlmZOPy8NO2MlCodgWqA9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

<review>This particular location left a lasting experience. The owner here is so chipper and welcoming and upbeat. He made waiting a better experience. He spoke well of his employees, in our case, of John. Very home-style feel. Food was excellent as always and had huge portions. Can't recommend enough on that orange juice. Freshly squeezed and just amazing. I've been to 3 locations and this was my best one so far.< /review>< pictures>

My parents live in Chino and I miss seeing them because of Covid. I thought what better way to help them then to bring them breakfast since they are both 80. I ordered 4 breakfasts with bacon and everything was amazing. They even included a brownie thanking us for our business, which was a very nice touch. I’m so thankful they were open as it allowed me to spend precious time with my parents, at a safe distance. Thank you Black Bear Diner!< /Text>

<Review>Black Bear Diner is worth a visit for the atmosphere. Everything, from the building and entry way, to the waiting area, to the dining spaces, to the bathroom is on theme. Even the waitstaff are decked out in bear paw suspenders (available for purchase at the register).
Outside of the atmosphere, the experience is average. The 50s-newspaper style menu is cute, but the service is a bit slow. The food is well portioned and not too expensive, but the quality is nothing to write home about. The waitstaff is responsive, but not affable.
The redeeming feature of my dining experience was the desserts: the huckleberry ice cream is original (and tasty!) and the blackberry cobbler was delicious.
Overall, Black Bear Diner is worth a visit  for the experience or a drop-in when you're in the area anyhow, but it won't be replacing my local favorites. The novelty of its atmosphere may wear off, but it's a solid diner.< /Review></record>

TERRIFIC Food and Even Better Service!! ...Just  To let you know, we asked for some ranch dressing. Somehow the blue cheese and ranch got mixed together and it was the most amazing combination we've ever tasted! My husband had it with his sweet potato fries and I put it my bake potato!  We started calling it the  Arnold Palmer of salad dressings! Please add it to your menu, as I will be back for this especially for this!❤😁</text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>Eek! I hate leaving a 3 star rating for good food. But bad service cannot be ignored.

When we arrived, a lady named Preslee seated us. Very unpleasant. No smiles.  Very cold. I was hoping she wasn't our server. She was. 😣

She comes back a minute later, took our drink order. We said we needed a minute. She didn't come back for like 10 minutes. The place wasn't that busy. One half was even closed off.

Took 27 minutes for our food to come out. When she brought it, my husband had to ask for a refill. And extra napkins. Took over 5 minutes. We asked for some mayonnaise when she brought that. We never got it.

Finally came back, and we asked for a box. After 5 minutes, my husband just went and got one at the counter. A few minutes later, we got the bill. SUPER dissapointed in our service.

That aside, the food is amazing. This was our first time at this location. We've been to the one in Klamath Falls, Or. And to the one in Rohnert Park, Ca many times.

The food is always amazing. This visit, I ordered the cheddar bacon burger, add avocado.  Well well done. It was a tad pink inside. The meat was super thick, but It was manageable. It was a darn good burger. Very flavorful. The fries were ok. Nothing special. Didn't have any salt.

Hubby got the chicken fried steak dinner. It was super good. Huge portions. he upgraded to a loaded baked potato. Yummy! He got mixed veggies, which he didn't eat, since he never got the mayo he asked for, to eat with them.

He got the cheddar broccoli soup with a cornbread muffin. Both were good. The soup was super creamy, and flavorful.

We will be back, although we will definetly avoid Preslee.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Black Bear Diners are amazing. Been to a few around California, and Arizona. My favorites are the steak and eggs, pancakes, and cinnamon French toast.

This one is close to home. Our server was especially great. Her kindness, and excellent service is the reason I got around to this rating.< /Review>

I like the way they make their hashbrowns, the bacon is well cooked. I wish they added more gravy on the biscuits, but it was still delicious. I didn't try the pancakes, I will next time.< /Text>

Been to the BBD in Boise, Idaho and Sunnyvale, Ca. This is total comfort food and consistently well prepared. Breakfasts are amazing, and the pancakes are THE BEST. Meatloaf doesn’t sound exciting, but it’s surprisingly good, and the pot roast is equally delicious.

Prices are reasonable here but there can be a wait at times, especially Sat or Sun mornings.<//review>

They make their own Ranch Dressing, wow thickest bacon ranch dressing I've ever had. Great tasting food. Nice place, only had to wait 30 minutes to sit down for lunch. Just south of California 60 on Mountain Avenue.< /Text>

Poor service, poorly prepared foods. Barely any sauce on undercooked pasta, the overcooked paper thin chicken parmesan burnt, no refill on my drink dispite asking multiple times. No I wont be back.<//Text>

The food is great. The online menu though...it's all over the place. Traditional grouping would be much better; breakfast, lunch, then dinner with specials and options after. It just jumps around back and forth...makes me want to go to IHOP.  Lol.<//review>

<Text>Pretty bland food. Had pesto salmon, green beans, and cornbread with coffee and cherry cobbler. Salmon was boring and lacked flavor, cornbread was excessively sweet although some people like it that way, Green beans had to be straight from a can. Cobbler filling also straight from a can. Portions were large. Service was good.<//Text>< rating>

I ordered curb side pick up and when I got there they weren’t answering the phone & nobody outside to take names. I went in to see what was going on and they rudely told us to wait outside and didn’t even bother to take my name. I will not order curbside pick up at this restaurant until they have a proper system in place.</Text>

Great regional chain diner! Excellent service. Cute, wonderfully kitschy bear motif throughout that makes me smile. I had a scramble, and there was a taco salad and a breakfast plate ordered at the table. Big Food. Excellent quality and delicious, so be not alarmed when you see massive plates on every table. Also feel free to ask for a box. They know how big their food is. They're cool about it. The service is friendly, attentive and prompt.

To anyone with food allergies, while they're not a specialized restaurant, the kitchen will work with you. I've developed a whole host of incredibly inconvenient food allergies (gluten, rice, peppers, potatoes, artificial dyes, most things that taste good...), and I was able to order a meal that was more than a salad without cobbling together twenty menu items. Our server made sure to note I have food sensitivities so I felt good about my meal prep without feeling like I was a pain... Wonderful! Thank you.

As a former diner dessert junkie, everything in the case looks like it's almost worth the misery (not quite) of the allergens inside... I can only imagine.<//Text>

<Review>NOT FOR LARGE GROUPS.

Don’t bother with this place if you have a party of 6 or greater.  There was no one ahead of us.  Was promised 10-15 min wait.  After about 5 different groups of 3’s and 4’s, we were told that they were still waiting for an area that would accommodate us.  After 30 minutes we left.</Review><userid>101998458883600344341< /userid><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>I ordered the Reuben sandwich. I HIGHLY recommend it! The corned beef was tasty, and did not have the fat that sometimes comes with corned beef. With my sandwich I had both french fries and onion rings. (It comes with only one option, but they prepared my meal without the one I ordered, so I actually tasted both!) I must say if you get french fries, the portion is large. If you get onion rings, there is not an up-charge, and they are good as well.< /text></record>

My family was playing a game as we waited for our food , then the restaurant’s manager comes in and offers us to solve his riddle and if solved our bill will be paid. We didn’t solve his riddle however he was kind enough to remove a dish off our bill (: he didn’t have too but still did. VERY NICE.
Do recommend eating here and will be returning soon.</review>< response>

<text>This is one of my favorite breakfast spots. The southern scramble is amazing. If you like sausage try the spicy sausage patty it excellent. The Shasta scramble is also very good. Over all their breakfasts menu is awesome I haven't found anything I don't like yet. Pancakes are excellent as well. If your looking for dinner dishes their meatloaf in my opinion is very good.<//text>< Resp>

Overall staff is ok but experienced racial discrimination by younger staff who asked people behind me if they wanted to be seated before me. His excuse was I "was on the phone and he didn't want to interrupt me",  yea right. So I guess he thought I rather let everyone get seated before me and never eat. I was only informing the rest of my party that I had arrived and was waiting for them to join.<//Text>

<review>First time there I ordered an omelette with a side order of bacon to go...paid $18.00 for the meal tipped the waiter $5.00 (trying to be generous), got home and found that they burned the bacon!  :(  Check your order before you leave those people have no integrity! And me being ex-military and disabled, (way-to-go Black Bear Diner)!!!</review>< Rate>

<userid>114773557719178740878</userid><review>My first time at this restaurant. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and when the waitress brought out my breakfast there was no gravy on the chicken fried steak. She went to the kitchen to get the gravy and came back to say the cook has to make more gravy. How does a cook give you your meal without it being completed. My granddaughter ordered the French toast and they didn't bring the syrup for it. Again the waitress had to go back to the kitchen to get the syrup.  As for the chicken fried steak, Polly's Pie restaurant makes it much better but it wasn't that bad.  I might go back to give them another chance so if I do I hope they can do a little better. The cook needs to do some improvement. The waitress tried.< /review>< pics>

Very good menu. The dinners are well-balanced,  and tasty with very affordable prices. My wife and I both had the chicken fried steaks with baked potatoes,  vegetables, and salads. The people who waited on our table were polite and helpful. The restaurant was clean, though there were no paper towels in the men's restroom. We have been to this location twice, and are waiting for the one in Moreno Valley to open. Black Bear is a very good place to dine.</text>

Went back to this place after the original opening date and everything was really good. Portions are amazing for the price of good food. I had the pesto salmon dinner which came with a soup or salad and two sides along with a choice of bread for under $15. Kelly was a pleasure to have as a waitress as she kept coming back to check on us, refill drinks and was a delight. Definitely will return again soon!</review>

Our server Haley (not sure if I am spelling it correctly) was the best. Professional, great listener, patience, understanding, kind and most importantly attentive to her customers. To management, let her do the training of how to treat customers especially with children.< /Review>

My cousin and I were seated right away and were greeted by Hailey. She was very attentive to us and very kind. The food was perfection. I swear I'll never look at another omelette the same. Anyways, go to this place because people are kind here, especially Hailey. P.s - It's not just the food but the environment and vibes were great.

The wait staff is on the younger side, Male, so service can be tweaked a bit, but overall waiter was attentive and fulfilled all special requests. My Beyond Burger Sourdough Burger was tasty and cooked medium rare...very juicy. The sweet potato fries were piping hot and tasty....just needed a tad of salt but I prefer to add salt, so it was perfect and crispy for my taste. Alot of great offerings bnb on menu...reasonably priced, hefty portions. You won't be disappointed.</Text>< UserId.>

The Black Bear Diner is just that. A diner. This is a chain with restaurants up and down the west coast and also in Nevada. It is at family-oriented with a lot of traditional American food. They are well oriented to having kids as well and also have kid food and bring color crayons and things for kids to draw on as well as cute cups with covers on them and straws for the kids to enjoy. The food portions are large and there is a lot of choice for anyone.< /Text>

Food was great. Was disappointed with the service. We have eaten at the Black Bear in Las Vegas and Bullhead and had great service there. Some items were extremely over priced for what you get. Sat next to the window and could feel the breeze coming through. We will not be back any time soon.< /review>

The menu had a large variety of items. My son and I had breakfast. The waiter was attentive without being hovering. The prices were relatively high but the food was good. So far my son and I have visited 2 locations. Chino and the location above the Grapevine, both in California.< /Text>

I love the Black Bear dinner chain.  Their food is always delicious.  They have great breakfasts and some really good dinners also.  This location only gets 3 starts however due to how long everything takes.  Great food just work on getting people their food in a timely manner.  I can't imagine that it's good for business having your average meal time taking an hour.<//text>

Where we usually go to black bear diner, we have awesome services and great food. BUT this black bear diner in Chino could use some management skills and training for there employees. And learn how to smile more, they Act like they don't want to be there. All in all we love the Buena Park one there awesome...< /review>

<Review>Servers and hostess were annoyed. Evidently someone didn't show up for work. I asked for sugar free syrup, she said they were out. Last time we were at this location they told me they didn't carry it . We had to flag down someone to get coffee. Food was mediocre. Won't be back.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate><user_name>Marsha Hayes</user_name>< GmapID>

This was my first time going to eat at Black Bear Diner and I loved it. The service was fantastic. They with out a doubt went out of their way to make you comfortable. The food was delicious and was at the right temperature. I know I would return and I recommend it highly. Oh yeah the decor was so nice. Very easy on the eyes.</review>

Outstanding food nice portions for the price your paying which by the way is reasonable. The pancakes themselves are worth the visit. Big and fluffy. They were very tasty the rest of the menu is also a hit. The atmosphere is very home like you feel comfortable here. The staff from the front all the way up to the manager is very friendly and helpful making sure your visit is a special one. If you get a chance jump off the 60 freeway on Mountain Avenue in Chino and look for the bear figures out front and come on in for good home cooked food. I guarantee you won't leave hungry.</review>

I ordered through doordash, ordered a burger, specifically out NO 1,000 ISLAND DRESSING. I even checked the receipt that they had printed on the bag, and it definitely said No, yet there was dressing on my burger. I then had to pull everything off the burger and just eat the patty. I know i am a picky eater, but I'm still annoyed, especially because it was definitely on the order. The food was okay though, other than that.< /Review>

Food was underseasoned. I recently visited one of the Black Bear Diners in Salinas, CA. The food was better there. I strongly suggest they should rotate the chefs through that kitchen to ensure they are preparing the food to the same standard as the original restaurants. The handicap access door needs to be unlocked, unless the handicapped are not welcome at Black Bear diner.<//Review>

I'd like to say, I'm a return customer to this Chino diner, and I didn't think I would be. You see I had a really bad dining experience, and had voiced that with the company. I than got an email from Ashley. She was very sincere in her attempt to make things right. We talked a few times on the phone, and with her promise to make it right, we came back. We were greeted by Ashley and our server, Susie was absolutely a delight!! I can say, they've definitely got it figured out. Staff was great!! Thank you Ashley, and Susie!!</Review>

Had been there one time for a cremation event.The food was great. Signed up for the bear club, and got a birthday breakfast...delicious...then had the best server ever, such a pleasant and kind young man...Daniel. Will definitely be back if not for the food but the great service. Also because they serve PEPSI...not many places do...YAHOO...</review>

<text>Today was my first time visiting Black Bear Diner and it was awesome. The service was great and price was very affordable. It is a little bit pricier than Denny's, but it is definitely worth it. They have freshly squeezed orange juice and the portions are very generous. Therefore, I highly recommend it.</text>< resp>

I've been here three times in one week not because I can't cook its because I love the  food and the atmosphere  breakfast is served all day with great options on the menu  and great dessert selection. Daniel is one of the best waiters he also makes sure that everything is great and your glass is never empty. This place makes you feel like home cooking with family environment and I can't wait to bring my kids next time.the manager Robert knows hospitality and greets his guest with a smile. I'll definitely be back again. Oh and they have a great jute box selection  and merchandise. So pick up something on your way out.</review>

<review>Waited over 20 min to be seated & another 15 to order. Service is too slow. They need seasoned waitresses,  older people that know what they're doing. Too many youngsters not knowing the business. Don't think I'll be coming back here.  You have to make better choices in your hiring.  Think it over management people!  This really SUCKS!. After posting this, I still have not got my Food!!!< /review>< Rate>

Good, diner food with attention paid to the little things. Everything tasted scratch made, and was very good. The staff are very friendly which makes this a fun place. Prices are reasonable and servings are generous. This has become a family favorite.</Text>

<Review>Maybe better then Dennys and that's not a compliment but no where near the quality and service of Norms. The host spoke of food the diner didn't serve. The order was half wrong the other order had missing food that was ordered in detail. The waiter was nice but slow. The prime rib was cold by the time we got it... What a waste. The chicken in the Pot Pie was dry. The biscuits in the biscuits & gravy were semi hard thick and dry. No where was it worth the price. The environment was nice.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Never heard about Black Bear dinner before a coworker mentioned it, I had no clue what I was missing,  the food tasted home made. Wife and I went for breakfast,  she ordered the French toast, I ordered the eggs Benedict with home potatoes, they were both perfectly cooked,  we will definitely be coming back.</Review><user>110924193554698865250<//user><time>1546108351038< /time><pics>None</pics><user_name>Jerry Reyes<//user_name><gmap_id>0x80c33314b3dd2e31:0x2b25dcd666ed5d46< /gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><rating>5</rating></record>

Great for breakfast, good for everything else. Service isn't fast but it has booths to seat larger groups... I like that. Kids meals end with a build-your-own sundae.
Note: weekend breakfast...line out the door. Plan ahead if waiting is an issue.<//text>

<Review>This restaurant is a place to have the best comfort food you have probably tasted in Ca. Its a restaurant to stop form any meal or snack. Reasonable pricing for any budget. Happy atmosphere but not quiet if thats what you prefer. Waiters accommodating.
Try it I think you will be pleasantly surprised.< /Review>< pictures>

<pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Rate>3</Rate><text>We like the food at this restaurant because it is enormous portions. What we don't like is the cleanliness (or lack of) of the place.  We have been in there many times and every time there is food on the floor around the tables, like they don't sweep or clean until the end of the night.  The carpet is in serious need of a steam cleaning or replacement, as it is just nasty!  The last time we were in there, the wait staff just forgot we were there, even though we were one of three tables in the whole place.  We had to flag someone down to get service. It seems to be getting worse each time we go in. Such a shame as it had real potential.</text><Date>1543368460335</Date><GmapID>0x80c33314b3dd2e31:0x2b25dcd666ed5d46< /GmapID>< Name>

Good selection, good food, and reasonable prices. I'm not a fan of Denney's and places like that. The Black Bear is much better and consistently good to various locations that we have been to.</Review>

Family friendly place for friends, family, or a quick bite. The portions are huge so no need to worry about getting your monies worth here. Excellent menu , deserts, drinks and atmosphere. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming.<//Review>

<Text>The "Shasta Scramble" with hash browns was excellent. Hubz had the "Chicken Apple Sausage" with country potatoes which was very good, but for some reason the cooks put some uncooked chopped red onions on one section of the plate? But otherwise the cooks did an excellent with his picky order...softly scrambles eggs, for example, and the food came faster than we thought. Our waitress, Susie, did a fine job. The wait to be seated wasn't too bad even though people were lined up outside. I recommend it.<//Text>< pictures>

Went tonight after going to the L.A. fairgrounds all day and so many pushy people although some were very considerate I am mobility challenged and on a mobility scooter other scooters were so obnoxious and pushy was embarrassed of them... but stopped at  the chino black bear diner on mountain let this young man leave.  He gave such good service never slowing down and giving excellent knowledge of the food, and made my order so much easier to make...excellent food, excellent service , actually too much food, if that possibly ,    lol. Will go back time and time again.      .</Text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>This was my first time dining here and it was different from what I'm used to. First thing I noticed was the breakfast entrees were a bit pricey. I ordered 2 eggs over medium, 2 slices of bacon and a waffle. The price was almost $10. The eggs came over easy and were quite small. They were the equivalent of one large egg. The bacon was a bit undercooked and the waffle was nothing special. The service was ok, considering I sat at the counter. People were lined up to get in as I was leaving. I doubt I'll return to this location.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Servings are humongous.

The sweet potato fries are to die for and their bacon ranch is very mildly baconed so really good.

The waffles are more like pancakes. Which are good but not your typical waffle.

The cornbread is heavenly.

The chicken fried steak melts in your mouth.

The Mac and cheese is pennie with a white cheese sauce. Could be cheesier.

Their breakfast ham is a half inch+ thick and fairly lean.< /text>

Although they have been open close to 6 months. They still have much to do in order to increase their efficiency on getting orders out in a timely manner. Although I will say when we finally got our food it was very good.<//Text>

<review>Really enjoyed my first visit. Cozy dinner environment with delicious comfort food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner offered all day.  All of the staff we encountered were friendly and worked well together to make our diner experience comfortable and well attended. A lot of places are out of the loop on teamwork these days, and this team has it. Prices are moderate, but the food and serving size make it worth it. I had the chicken pot pie, really good! Still trying to put my finger on what spice or herb they add to make that unique taste. I sampled some of my friends Chicken fried steak and definitely think ill try it next visit, or the time after next.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I mean, it's mediocre. The customer service is great but the food isn't anything to get excited about. It's not bad, it's just not super good either. And I think it's overpriced. I paid $19 for a ribeye that was only 1/8 of an inch thick. I mean, it was so, so, so thin. It was tender, and it tasted fine, but why was it $19? I don't know, I would rather go to Norm's/IHOP/Denny's and pay less to get the same quality of food. However, it was my first time there. Everyone keeps raving about their breakfast plates so I'll go back again soon and try the breakfast to see if it's any better. I'll edit this post at that time. 😉</Review>

Great food and good prices. And 2 thumbs up to the employees and service! I had forgotten my scarf in the morning, called just after closing, and they held on to it until I was able to pick it up.< /review>

We waited 30 minutes table for two. The waitress had low energy, not friendly but definitely not rude, she, like the rest of the staff looked miserable in there. I gave them two stars for the following reasons:
Tasty pancake, bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice, but we will definitely not be back.<//text>< pics>

A friendly place, with a cute bear-themed decor.  And even as you are entering, there is music piped outside that is kitschy and fun.  The food is generous, and good; you will end up with a take-home box!</review>

I love pancakes, but there's had a flavor added that just made them too sweet for me. Everyone else liked their meal. They do give very large portions.</review>

Tonight was the worst experience I have had at Black Bear Diner in Chino.
At 8 pm. and the restaurant about half full my wife and I waited over 10 minutes to get seated.
The entire time we waited there were six plates of food setting up on the counter.
There were 3 families in line to pay for their bill and 2 groups of 2 waiting to get seated.
I was told that there were no clean tables.
So 2 hours before they close there was no one to clean the tables, no one to take the money and no one to seat you.
After 10 minutes of waiting with no one else ahead of me someone came up and asking for my name to put me on the list to get seated.
All this time there were 5 people in the kitchen.
We walked out and went to Corky's and enjoyed our dinner.<//text>

<Text>The food is usually pretty good but be ready to WAIT!  I sat the the bar and observed the operation.  The bottleneck is definitely at the front of the house serving staff.  A lot orders sat under the heat lamp for over 10 minutes. As I'm writing this review I'm still waiting for my food for over 27 minutes and counting.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Bait and switch.  Had a special advertised on the table mat. When ordered it was no longer available but one at a higher price was. This was at noon Sunday.</review>

I ordered eggs over easy, they were almost raw, ordered sausage and got bacon. I will not be coming back. The waffle tasted like it was made with pancake batter.</text>

This review is for a delivery order (thru Postmates) from this location..

Steak & Eggs were unexpectedly tasty.  They were cooked as requested & suprisingly delivered better than expected.

One egg with sausage & pancake was equally delicious.  I normally get bacon but glad I tried their sausage.  It's so good!

Black Bear Diner also uses really nice to-go containers so don't worry about spills or messes.

Great food, delivery & service.</text>

< Review>
I've been here twice now, once with my husband, this last time with a party of 4. Both times the food was great, but it took FOREVER! We went this past Sunday morning, got there about 8am and there was no wait. Restaurant wasn't packed yet, so we figured we would be good. We all ordered breakfast, and waited for 45 minutes for our food. Food was really good!! Biscuits and gravy could have used a little more gravy, but very yummy! Our waitress kept our coffee mugs full the whole time, which was great, but to wait that long for breakfast was excessive.
I would like to come back here, but I hope their food service picks up.< /Review>

Tonight was the worst experience I have had at Black Bear Diner in Chino.
At 8 pm. and the restaurant about half full my wife and I waited over 10 minutes to get seated.
The entire time we waited there were six plates of food setting up on the counter.
There were 3 families in line to pay for their bill and 2 groups of 2 waiting to get seated.
I was told that there were no clean tables.
So 2 hours before they close there was no one to clean the tables, no one to take the money and no one to seat you.
After 10 minutes of waiting with no one else ahead of me someone came up and asking for my name to put me on the list to get seated.
All this time there were 5 people in the kitchen.
We walked out and went to Corky's and enjoyed our dinner.< /Review>

The food is usually pretty good but be ready to WAIT!  I sat the the bar and observed the operation.  The bottleneck is definitely at the front of the house serving staff.  A lot orders sat under the heat lamp for over 10 minutes. As I'm writing this review I'm still waiting for my food for over 27 minutes and counting.</review>

<Review>1st time here, only 2 waiters at lunch, wait too long to order. 3 empty booths not cleaned, empty tables so sat at back in table with booth. Coffee cold, had to ask for refill. Asked for more ICE tea. Biscuits where hard. For $8 It was a lot just to eat the 2 pcs of bacon. When I paid Bill, she never asked how was our meal, not a word, took the signed Bill and walked away. For a lunch time visit it was very disappointing. I have been to the one in Oregon and was very good. They need more experienced help.<//Review><userid>114984230719079263869< /userid><gmap_id>0x80c33314b3dd2e31:0x2b25dcd666ed5d46< /gmap_id><Date>1500220594360< /Date></record>

<Review>Went here today for breakfast/lunch around 12:30
There were four of us. My two year old son was miserable because the flies kept landing on his head. My Mother-
In-law had flies land on her face and my wife and I had them land on us.
Every customer in the restaurant were swatting at flies. When I went to pay my bill--I asked to speak to the manager.
I assure you--I was Not trying to get out of paying my bill. I told Miguel-the manager--about the flies. He acted very surprised. Then he proceeded to tell me that they were working on it and that they had the exterminator there. Then he told me that there were lots of farms in the area. I explained to him that I lived on a dairy here in chino all of my life and that he needed to go to all of the surrounding restaurants and see that they Do Not have flies. Miguel was extremely rude and could care less about the flies and my complaint. I told him that I don't have flies in my kitchen at home and why would I come here to pay 50 dollars and fight the flies.
I will Never go back. Not appreciated.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Rating>1</Rating>< GmapID>

I typically have a great breakfast experience here. After visiting 6 locations from Arizona to LA, I know what I'm looking for during my time spent with black bear. I understand how busy this location is, expect a wait during breakfast. However, for the first time ever at black bear, I received terrible service. He had zero ability to read his guests needs as we were left without water for our entire meal after we ran out, he attempted to take our order before even taking our drink order, and was non-existent our entire meal, having to ask others around for basically anything.  When I return and if I'm sat in his section, will be demanding a change of service. Sorry for the review Black Bear and thank you for the great food.< /review>

Good food but the service was terrible. They were busy but no excuse when you have to ask for every little thing and wait more than 45 minutes for your food and then it's barely warm.< /Review>

Food was great. Service was slow and we had to ask for items several times before getting them. Usually this place is much better, so I'll chalk this visit up to a bad day.< /Review>

The ambience of this place gets you in. Cute bears, cabin architecture and the promise of lumberjack quality cuisine. Nope! It's a step up from Carrol's and that's about it. The food is bland and honestly its like food mom makes at home when she's tired...I was disappointed. Maybe next time I'll do just dessert.< /Text>

Waited for 10 to 15 minutes to be seated. The place was basically empty. One person took our order and another brought it out. The trip tip plates were dried out as if they were sitting under a heat lamp far too long. My granddaughter ordered pasta which came out like rubber, we asked for a replacement and it was just as bad. Sent the trip tip plate back without eating as it was like eating peppered beef jersey and the gravy had a thick layer across the top. Not my idea of a good family meal.</text>

Anthony was great but the host manager owner what ever was a sullen arrogant man who was more interested in scolding the server who did not see the food because another server delivered it, than talking to unhappy customers. We will not be back...</Review>

<text>It was President's Day and it was windy. Everyone was waiting inside the lobby and were absolutely packed in. I decided not to wait and placed an order to go at the counter. You could tell the Host was stressed but he was holding it together pretty well.
Not an ideal day but it was still a good experience and the food was good.< /text>< UserId.>

Pancakes! Yummy, yummy SWEET CREAM pancakes!

That's all you need to know. But just in case the wait scares you... let me just say it's worth it. I drove by for months before actually going in. But now that I've gone, I wish I would've gone sooner.

I came on a weekday morning and was seated immediately. I had no idea what to order, so my waitress pointed out the sweet cream pancakes are the winner. And she was right!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

We also ordered an omelet, chicken fried steak and a philly sandwich. Everything was made well and delivered quickly. Good service, friendly smiles, fair prices! I'll be back. Thanks BBD!< /review>

My breakfast was delicious but the service is lacking. Server never came back once I got my meal. I Never got a coffee refil after a different server asked if I need a refil. I had to wait for quite sometime for the cashier who was on the phone taking an order despite there was another cashier standing next to him. When he finally got off the phone they took up more of my time talking about his frustrating call.</Review>

This place is amazing. Is a brand new so there was a wait so not sure if it will always be like that after a few more days. We waited about half an hour and it was worth the wait. The staff are very friendly and the menu is simple but offers many choices. It was my birthday and they gave me a free scoop of Huckleberry ice cream and it was amazing. Having my birthday dinner here was a really good decision and would definetely recommend this place to anyone. Also don't forget to try out their cornbread muffin, is so good!</text>

<Review>Came in for dessert. Was seated and told waitress would be right with us.  NEVER happened! We waited 15 minutes and no one came to our booth to even ask what we wanted to drink. The diner was not busy. We got up and left. We went up to Corky's Kitchen. Don't think we will be coming back to Black Bear. Very poor customer service.< /Review>< Resp>

Great food! Horrible wait to be seated! We had a party of 6 and were told we would have a 25 minute wait it was actually 45+ minutes. This was a Saturday so I will go back on a weekday.</text>

< Review>
This was my first visit, but will not be going back. The place was not busy when we went, yet my daughter and I stood in the front lobby for well over 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence. Then we waited another 5 minutes or so before being seated. Once seated, it was about 15 minutes before anyone approached the table to take drink orders. Then the long wait for our food, which was totally unimpressive. Our waitress was not attentive at all. Overall not a good experience. Very unprofessional staff.</Review>

Place is clean and food is served in very large portions, also very inexpensive. My hubby and I could have gotten by with sharing a single breakfast. I do recommend tgis place to others.</Text>

<text>Love Black Bear Diner but it's our first time at the Chino location and I was disappointed. Food was amazing as always but if you cant make eggs correctly then it's a let down for me. I sent it back the 1st time and didn't get it back till the other people were almost done with their food the second time I got it back everyone was done eating and just waiting on me to get my food. I know your thinking this lady is nuts but they were messing up EGGS!! Seriously my 2yr could have made them better and all I want was over easy eggs nothing fancy nothing complicated. But no apparently chino takes 30min to cook eggs and cant make them over easy. But if you like fried eggs your in luck becuase they have those down!!</text>< pics>

Came in for dessert. Was seated and told waitress would be right with us.  NEVER happened! We waited 15 minutes and no one came to our booth to even ask what we wanted to drink. The diner was not busy. We got up and left. We went up to Corky's Kitchen. Don't think we will be coming back to Black Bear. Very poor customer service.<//Text>

<Text>Service was terrible had to have another waitress find my waitress twice.   When food came it was almost cold, the claim chowder is the worst I have ever had and the waitress never asked if we wanted anything or if everything  was ok  we wanted crackers and Tabasco for the chowder it didn't really  matter though for the soup was nasty, and the chicken fried steak tasted like the frozen kind in a TV dinner. Very processed food nothing healthy and very bland food.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1531346384704, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear your experience at Black Bear Diner wasn’t up to snuff.

<Review>Had dinner with friends at the Black Bear in Chino, CA.  I saw chicken and waffles on the menu and could not resist. Great choice and I was very pleased.  The waffle was fluffy and sweet and the chicken was hot and crispy; the Black Bear nailed the sweet and savory treat.<//Review>< Pics>

First of all service was all bad my server Renee was no where to be found throughout my entire meal. literally had one cup of coffee. my breakfast was not great either my potatoes were still raw couldn't even chew them even my 2yr old who literally eats anything spit them out, also who serves coffee without creamer? Renee does... my toast was terrible as well it was so dry not even a smear of butter on it whoever is running the kitchen needs to get it together. I will not be coming back that's for sure

P.s I understand there was an emergency but that is not an excuse for a restaurant to stop functioning properly<//text>

Waited almost an hour for our food, it wasn't busy, and when our food finally did come it was cold. Let our server know who talked to the manager. Our server came back to the table and told us that "the manager said he's very sorry you had a poor experience." Didn't bother to come to the table or take anything off the bill. This place is a joke, the manager is a coward, and the service is poor. Take your money elsewhere.<//Review>< Pictures>

Always see people waiting in line during lunch or dinner and wanted to come to try once.  We came in around 2:30pm there was nobody to greet up front.  It took 2 servers and standing around for 10min to get seated.  Do they wanna do business or not?  I ordered corn beef hash with hash browns.  OMG what horrible quality food.  The hash brown literally tasted like burnt strips of bark, completely inedible and it was obvious they sat around and just served microwaved.  Corn beef was supposed to be ''hashed' and not torn into strips and served dry.  It was too salty and again was cooked a long time ago and sat around.  They replaced the hash browns with country potatos which was made to order this time but so salty from over-seasoning that I gave up eating my meal.  Their only advantage is big portions, but what's the point in having a lot of bad tasting food?  This proved yet again Californians don't understand the definition of down home American comfort food, better just eat ethnic foods in CA you'll be better off.<//Text>

One waiter for the entire restaurant.  Took forever and the order wasn't right.  Asked him for extra mayo for an extremely dry sandwich and he forgot.  I left 75% of my sandwich there.  It was horrible.  Waste of money.  He really needed help.< /review>

I've always enjoyed black bear Diner's, so I forgot I'm a girlfriend to her first one here in Chino. The portions are ridiculously large and that is wonderful.</Text>

First time there. Usually just passed by. Dont regret going there from now on. Yes the wait was a bit. But it was worth the wait. Tasty. My mom loved her steak. Chix strips the bomb
Onion rings great. More of the onion than the flour.< /Text>

<review>After my last visit, I had to update my review. This place has really gone downhill. The food is now poor, in addition to poor service. My favorite open faced turkey sandwich had, what I can only call jello gravy on top, so congealed it wiggled. And salty to the extreme. I could not get a servers attention to address it until the others in my party were 80% done. Ridiculous. His response? “Oh the gravy is not good again? Maybe I can get you something else?”  Um, AGAIN?  Ok... no thanks. I just gave up at that point. We will not be back.

——-

Good food but inconsistent service. Portions are huge. Love the pancakes and the open faced turkey sandwich is a favorite.  The homemade chips were yummy too.  They have an eclub where you get a free pastry and birthday meal.< /review>< Name>

<text>Update: Today, 3/5/2018 at 8:40 am I recieved the worst service of my life. I have never been treated with such indifference and lack of hospitality.

I walked in with my husband and this old man with his middle aged son are waiting with two other old men who were already there. The hostess asks us how many are in my party. I tell her two and this old man with a party of six which isn't even all together yet insists he be seated first so they can drink coffee. Okay. Fine. But the hostess never came back to seat us. We waited another 3 minutes for another server to come and seat us, which only happened because more customers had walked in already. We're taken to a table and given our drinks, server comes back to take our order and that's it. Food never came, my husband was never asked if he wanted more coffee. Meanwhile, the old men whose party isn't even complete are seated and enjoying coffee refills to their hearts content. The same hostess that never came to seat us walked passed us 6 times with TWO POT OF COFFEE. Needless to say we walked out.

TL;DR
Got really bad service. Waited too long to be seated, never got refills on coffee and food took over 20 mins to not get to our table.< /text>< Rating>

If you're looking for some really good home cooked food this place is a great option for you. It's pretty popular so if you plan on getting there in the morning set your alarm clock early.< /text>

Great food and a good amount but the staff is very slow and literally will walk fast and put there heads down so they dont make eye contact. Would eat there again maybe but expect to wait for food and refills.</Text>

<Text>Got a very very small portion of ribs 3 to be exact. Also waiter took my dirty napkin and never returned with another until.asked and only got one serving of tea when you usually get refills. I'm not usually one to complain but would like to have a second cup of what ever I'm drinking and couldn't believe that my silver ware was dirty. And still can't understand how 3 ribs is classified a half rack< /Text>< pics>

Overpriced and only one semi healthy meal option in the menu. Waitress was distracted and service was poor. Overrated diner. I'll stick with IHOP.< /text>

I went yesterday morning for breakfast with my fam. Around 9am 9:15am. We liked going there we were good customers always left them good tips but nope not no more not after this. The waitress spill the COFFEE on my 2 yr old. Yes! COFFEE! Hot! On a 2 year old. Did she bother to say something, nope, my 2 year old was crying and crying.  No manager, she couldn't call the manager, oh but she did bring the bill to the table. Really, we gotta pay after what you did... it was her fault! No manager to talk to....I couldn't wait for manager to get there I had to go to the nearest pharmacy and get something for my 2 year old skin which was RED! My 2 yr old safety is 1st. So I paid! Yes  I paid and not happy with that! But I'm really upset at the restaurant they could at least take care of us since that happened.  But nope, apparently the safety of the customers don't matter, they just care for the money. If you have children please please think about it before going there. For sure not going there any more. They lost customers and I say customers because I looked a lot of people there and they kept going but they won't after this.<//Review><name>Griselda Qui<//name></record></dataset><record>

The restaurant is very family oriented and clean. Their decorations are unique to their theme. I also like that they have their founders picutures and biographies up on the wall. The food is homestyle comfort that is delicious.</review>

<Review>This place doesnt take reservations so we asked if they can accommodate a group of 20, which they said they easily could. They sat us immediately but things were downhill from there. The orders were wrong, the food was average, two orders were forgotten, and it took forever for simple things like refills, ketchup, etc. We realize it's a newer location for this chain and anticipated slower service but the food was disappointing as well as the customer service. The waiter tried very hard to do as much as he could but he literally had no help. The manager didnt come over until we requested her, even then she was very reluctant to offer support to the waiter. We've eaten at other Black Bear restaurants in Northern California but this location's service and especially food were VERY disappointing.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c33314b3dd2e31:0x2b25dcd666ed5d46</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Chino Black Bear diner makes the best food in town a variety to choose from pancakes to burgers etc. Large portions too. If you haven't been there, try it once and you'll keep going back!< /Text>

I was offered another salad, soup or anything else. However, I was unable to eat my full meal because I was checking every item to make sure it was alright. I was insulted that the meal was merely discounted. The manager could have checked the cameras if she felt that I was not being forthright. I will not be returning. Two meals for $60.00 - 20%... We could have stopped at In 'N Out for $15.00< /text></record>

The secret to beating the morning rush is to walk in while others are waiting, and volunteering to sit at the counter. Service is imediate and the hustle and bustle around is entertaining.</Text>

The service was not super friendly the server was more worried of the quantity of tables then giving quality service, and the food was not that good they gave my daughter burnt bacon and u could see how burnt it was when she picked it up it broke, I couldn't believe it was even on her plate ,they did replace it but I'm not joking when I say burnt!!  And my sandwich , had soggy bread cause it was so thin<//Text>

I love Black Bear Diner. This one is new and hopefully will bring their customer service up to the standard expected by regulars. We went here right before my son had to go back to Camp Pendleton. There was another military family there also saying there farewells. The lead Host is great and tries to get the staff on board but the hostess upfront and the servers are very inexperienced. This Black Bear Diner does not provide the at home comfy warm feeling I am used to at other locations. Hopefully in time. The food was ok compared to the other locations.</text>

Great food. Huge plates compared to the prices. Service is not that great. Takes a while to be seated even if there is no one there and service at the table takes a while too, though they are nice.<//text>

If I could give 0 stars I would worst place ever never have stuff I order need someone who knows how to purchase and keep food stocked. Its sad when you cant even order deserts and tried to order 3 different things and everyone of them they didnt have. This is the 3rd time this happened. First time they ran out of oatmeal Really and instead of telling us after waiting for 30 min they trued to hurry a batch that you could roll into a ball it was so dry and not cooked. The 2nd time we went they had ran out of sweat potatoe fries then tonight we go just for desert I ask for Chocalate brownie told they dont have anymore so then I say ok how about Chocalate cream pie im then told they dont have that either so needles to say turned around and walked out again for the 3rd time and so 3 strikes your out will never go back again!!!</text>

Food was good and the service was friendly but towards the end of our meal we felt a little neglected and had to wait quite sometime for refills on our drinks. Then when we took the check up to the front to pay out we were standing there for quite sometime before we were helped.< /Review>

This place doesnt take reservations so we asked if they can accommodate a group of 20, which they said they easily could. They sat us immediately but things were downhill from there. The orders were wrong, the food was average, two orders were forgotten, and it took forever for simple things like refills, ketchup, etc. We realize it's a newer location for this chain and anticipated slower service but the food was disappointing as well as the customer service. The waiter tried very hard to do as much as he could but he literally had no help. The manager didnt come over until we requested her, even then she was very reluctant to offer support to the waiter. We've eaten at other Black Bear restaurants in Northern California but this location's service and especially food were VERY disappointing.< /Review>

<review>I really didn't eat there but had to score it before I could leave a msg. I see we are getting one in MorenoValley but the website doesn't list it in the upcoming sites to open. I want to know why? The menu looks great. Perris and Sunnymead blvd where CoCo's was will become a Black Bear Diner.</review>< name>

My Dad recently moved very close to this location and I can't get enough! Everything I have tried has been beyond great!! The new York steak, the meatloaf, the chicken fried steak, the omletes, the cornbread muffins... Geeze it's all bomb!< /Text>

Friends had hyped this place up pretty good, as they found it years before in far-Northern CA after emerging from the wilderness during a camping trip.

The theme is log-cabin-y, and the food is traditional "American Comfort Food" served in very large portions. Fortunately, they offer downsized (aka normal sized) portions of most of their dishes. I opted for this smaller serving of their meatloaf, as it was getting late in the evening.

It was good, it's hard to screw up meatloaf and mashed potatoes with gravy. The bacon beans tasted like they had sat in tupperware too many days after coming out of the can. Salad was food-service iceberg with generic food-service creamy blue cheese.

Where this place truly fell on it's face was service. Restaurant was at less than 25% capacity on a Tuesday evening, and it took over 30 minutes after ordering for our group of 7 to be served our meals. We were not an intimidating group, but the three waitresses working our particular dining room were scarce, and seemed to avoid our party, as if they thought we'd be extra work. So just as I was about to give up ordering a chocolate malt for dessert, I finally flagged a waitress down. 15 minutes later, I was served a ginormous, yet absolutely ordinary chocolate malt, when I should have been going to bed.

For a new place, the carpet had some gnarly stains, and the restroom was out of paper towels.

Their menu is a little newspaper-type thing. One "article" on the front page details the chain's absolutely cancerous growth in the last ten years, citing all of the diners they have opened up in various cities, with the rate of maliginancy exponentiating in the last two years.

Like any cancer, this growth will be soon fatal if they don't have proper management overseeing the twentysomethings that scurry around and crew this diner. Such management was clearly not present the evening of my visit.<//Text>

< Review>
We had to wait over an hour to get a table at 1 pm on Sunday. Then waited 10 to 15 mins to even have someone bring us some water. We did not have silverware and had to ask for it. We ordered 3 meals one had to be sent back because out was not hot, one was a salmon dinner that had no flavor and mashed potatoes were also not hot, the last meal was blt sandwich that was ok but fried were under cooked and a little greasy. The answer from the waitress was that it was Sunday and their busy day, so you would think that they would have more staff for a busy day. All I could see was about 3 waitresses and 1 or 2 bus boys... overall spent 50$ & not satisfied<//Review>

You don't want to even eat there. My mom just got food poisoning from there​ a few days ago and is still sick. Plus, there service is really bad and you have to wait a long time to get anything.</text>

Someone needs to clean between the seat cushions in the booths. Food okay. Definitely home because they used my bread plate to transport my chix to the kitchen for heat up when served cold put right on my half eaten corn muffin, only see that at home. Staff friendly.</text>

<Text>So today was the second day they were open and my family and I got there around 5:30-6. There was about a 35 min wait which wasn't bad since it was dinner time. We got seated and were super excited! Our waiter finally came to get our drink order after about 10 mins. of walking by us...we ordered the kids food right away since they were hungry and it came out right away which was awesome but then they tried it, it was clumpy and hard. But they tried to eat as much as they could but were really disappointed. I'm not one to send food back so I told them to at least eat their fries (which were good). But I mean come on...how hard is it to make a decent kraft mac n cheese? Anyways, I then had to flag down our waiter for our drinks because he had forgotten them. Then we finally received our drinks and placed our order. After about 35-40 mins (when our children were already done eating their dessert) we FINALLY got our food. My husband was completely disappointed with his food. My french toast were good but my eggs were over cooked and saugage did NOT look appealing at all! So over all the food was crap and the service was horrible and normally I wouldn't be so critical but for it barely being the second day I was really bummed. Gonna give it a second try for breakfast but overall was really disappointed with our experience.< /Text>< UserId.>

We literally got up and left because we didn't get any service after we were sat down at our table.

We literally got up and left because we didn't get any service after we were sat down at our table. When we asked where our server was at, the young gentleman just shrugged, smiled, and said "well I don't know, I'm not a server!" He then walked over to the young lady who was supposed to be our server and they both just laughed as we walked out!</review>

The food was average , not bad, but not great. I don't think it's worth waiting 30 minutes to be seated.<//Review>

The server continually checked up on us and the wait time was short. Con: There was hair and cracked eggshells in my omelette. My friend's omelette only had cracked eggshells in hers. They offered to replace it but I was done eating.< /Text>
