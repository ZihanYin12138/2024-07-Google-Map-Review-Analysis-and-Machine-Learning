<text>Sears has always been there for us when needed tire repairs or batteries for our vehicles. Excellent Service!! This location is in a separate building from the main store on the side of the mall. The facility is clean, prices are reasonable the waiting room is nice. You can go inside and shop while you wait for your vehicle to be repaired. They also provide basic maintenance service.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Buyer beware:  Simple punctured tire tuened into three days of nonsense and wasting time.  At first They sais that my tire's bead was bad and were going to charge me for a new tire.  I asked to see the tire and was shown a tire that was obviously cut into due to the mechanic's negligence.  The tune then changed to them offering to put my spare on for free.  It only took two more days for them to get me the correct tire and fix.  Unfortunately, that wasn't done right and my tire was inflated to the wrong pressure causing me to go somewhere else to get it checked out.  I stopped calling to talk to the manager as I had wasted enough time dealing with this.  They also have upsell techniques as everyone I heard was being introduced to have coolant swap out.  Strange that every person "needed" this.<//Text>

<Review>I have always gone to Sears automotive for my oil changes because I felt they knew what they were doing and were at a higher standard than other places here in Torrance CA. But today I had a man named Alex at Sears automotive did my oil change and did Not reset it, so I had to drive all the way back so he could get into my car Again and all he did was look at my dash screen and scroll through all the options get out of the car and then told me "okay it's reset now ".  But it's not reset.</Review><Name>Smb Bms< /Name><user>109278100278374021471< /user></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a store that has a car-top cargo carrier IN STOCK?  We were in desperate need of a one after seriously underestimating the amount of ‘stuff’ we had to fit in our car for our 17 day drive from California to Florida.  Sears Auto Center in Torrance was able to provide us with both a quality carrier and professional installation at what I thought was a reasonable price.  Our customer service advisor(s), especially Yesenia and Austin, were beyond helpful.  Everyone was friendly and interested in making sure we received the best service possible to get us back on the road in no time.  Many thanks and kudos to the service team at Sears Austin Center in Torrance!<//Review>

< review>
Excessive damage to rims with installation of tires.  Replaced 2 tires and work done was unprofessional.  Paint on rims was freshly chipped and peeling.  Edge of rims were freshly damaged and shards of aluminum were freshly ground and splintering.  The damage was all new and the chips and shards were splintered and able to be removed with my finger verifying the damage was new.  Rims are 14 years old, discontinued and irreplaceable Lincoln OEM.  Not the first replacement of tires and not curb damage.  No such edge damage on other 2 rims verifying the work had been done numerous times previously without damage and able to be done professionally.  Also, it took 2 hours to work on and damage 2 tires.  I'm going to ask for a refund on installation, all the warranty/balance and hazard coverage.  Went there so I could use my Sears Credit card with 12 month payments and cause I use Craftsman tools.  Never going there again.  Googled Sears Tire complaints and first one I read was the same exact situation/damage on $2000 Mercedes rims.</review>

<Review>Purchased a car battery on-line, filling in every thing about my car, year, make, model and go to have installed and after an hour or so they tell me it won't fit. said on-line the battery would fit my car. Two hours later I finally get my car back with my original battery, what a waste of time and energy. To top it off the woman manager keeps trying to tell me there a different types of batteries and I keep telling her the info I input about my car said this battery would fit my car, I even showed her the copy of my on-line purchase saying it would fit but she still wanted to argue the fact that there was more than one type of battery I ordered?</Review>< pictures>

Current review 2018,;

Well I have reviewed this place more then once,
And time around is a different story, it's not the same quality service that it once was.
Old review: 2016 ; What can I say, $14.99 oil changes plus $7.99 filter and you can make an online appointment it's perfect!!

If you don't have an appointment the wait time sucks, when they're working on your car a text message is sent to your phone if they find other problems with your car? so unless you reply to the text messages they hold your car until they've spoken to you. if there's a fan belt that needs to be replaced I guess that's a good thing? but it just depends if they want to change something that doesn't need to be replaced which was the case in my experience.

**On the plus side, When you get an oil change here, they do a "Pro Snap Shot" of you car,  this means they profile your car, i.e  tires, battery, alignment, transmission  oil level, computer scan and tire pressure. Every time I'm here they say "Battery Unreachable" "Transmission Oil Unreachable"? Ok, guys,  My Battery is in the trunk? it's a Jaguar and easy to find. My "Transmission oil level is located at the bottom of my car near the Motor Oil Pan" very close to where they drain my oil from?.  Something not right here?

There's two guys who's very nice "Mike" "William" the girls are not really nice. And assistant Manager is William.. I believe The actual manager is a female but I don't know her name.

A regular turnaround time for a  oil change here  is 1 hour, if you think that's too long then don't come here... But  if you think that's OK then by all means you found yourself a fordable/quality place to do your future oil changes.

General labor costs are high here at $90 per hour. I asked them to do my eight spark plugs for me and they wanted to charge me about $150 just for labor and another $90 for parts.

I was also told they do AC service here: I will keep you guys posted....

*Recap: 3 months later...*Continuation from last post: I did have my AC service here and everything turned out great! They found that it was only a small peace needed replacement and it was only couple of dollars to replace, in actuality  the whole thing cost me about $130-$150 and I believe that's reasonable.

They  also have basic maintenance services available, such as: transmission maintenance, radiator flush, spark plug replacement, hit night restoration, cabin and intake air filter replacement and much more.< /text>

<text>The Sears Auto Center in Torrance is absolutely garbage. At first I thought it was a stellar deal since I drive Uber to supplement my income, so I took my vehicle in for an oil change. I normally do my own oil change, but due to a back injury I am unable to and thought that this place would be perfect and it is local. I soon realized that the employees employed at the Torrance Sears Auto Center plain and simple don't want to make money for the company. They absolutely have no concerns for Sears the company that pays their checks. I went in there and my vehicle was one quart low of oil which I knew and instead of putting one quart of oil in the car I decided just to get it changed since it was due. One of the older mechanics went to take my vehicle to lunch and the lady at the front desk stopped him since I was out there observing, he quickly exited my vehicle leaving my door wide open and running with no paper mats blocking his oiled dirtied shoes or from my interior that is blonde in my car and said he is not working on it there is no oil in the car. I have a newer vehicle and I'm 100% sure the dummy light would be on if I had no oil in my car which it was only 1/2 quart low. When I ask for the manager they said he had left for an assignment and it would be back in 15 minutes I went to Target across the street and put a 1/2 quart of oil in my car which leveled right spot on. When I returned to ask to see the manager and it was about 25 to half an hour from when they said he would be there; the lady went on to tell me that the manager is an older guy and he drives extremely slow and he wouldn't be there for another 10 minutes and the other manager wouldn't be there till next week. I told her "You guys just don't want to make money, it's a simple oil change and you guys do not care about the business and good luck on her job search." I never experienced such an appalling experience at a corporate Sear Auto Center there is no excuse for that type of behavior, an actual lack of wanting to do the job, they were apparently hourly employees that were just sitting there on the clock collecting a check and not wanting to work. The mice were definitely at play while the cat was away. I think that whole shop as far as the employee's go, need an enema. They need to get a new group of employees that are brand sensitive and want to work and earn money at the Sears Auto Center in Torrance by the Del Amo mall or go ahead and shut down like it looks like they are in the process of preparing for; I am absolutely disgusted by my experience there. ¡!Boo-Urns¡!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Horribly long!!!! I'm sitting in the lounge at 421pm and was told they brought the wrong part, funny thing is they brought the wrong part around 11am!!! But because the techs have ABSOLUTELY NO INCENTIVE to consider the customer's time it was not noticed earlier.  I've been here since 10am, and now I have yet another hour maybe!?!!  They don't provide WiFi... And the senior desk person doesn't know customer service. Only here b/c of Sears cc, I'm sure it's the same for most.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

Horrible. Just horrible. I went to get an alignment and when i left the place, there was no difference. My car still veered to the right. When i came back they test drove it, they said there was no problem and it was just fine but when i went to a different mechanic, they said it did veer to the right so they fixed it. The customer service at sears is just horfible and thats a place i wo t be coming back.</review>

Before purchase of a battery, I had asked the Sales Associate if they check the charging system. He assured me they do, so we purchased a Diehard Gold battery with installation. As I watched the technician install the battery, he never connected a meter/analyzer to our vehicle, but looked inside at the dash board. I had asked the sales associate again when we were paying, why the technician did not perform an electrical check, he said that was okay. Well our work order said they would perform performance  test and we did not get what was promised.</text>

<resp>{'time': 1493849931168, 'text': "Thank you for choosing us to repair your brakes.  It's unfortunate that the brakes are making noise and it is understandable why you were unsatisfied.  Most of our brake jobs have minimal brake noise but when it does make noise we must allow a braking in period of 500 miles. The brake pads and parts meet or exceed manufacturer parts.  The quality in parts is our priority that are installed in our customer's vehicle.  We machine all rotors that get our brake service at no cost and Sears Automotive Techs stand by their work and prefer to machine rotors with every brake service.

The veterinarian assistant that helped us with a feline emergency was super thorough with her information gathering and made us feel like they really cared for our pet.

They also fit us in at a moments notice. Definitely would recommend especially when the other vets are so busy it can take hours of waiting!< /review>

<review>This is our first experience here with Katella Animal Clinic. We knew our Boba, the chihuahua, had some dental issues so we sought care here. Initial visit determined Boba needed dental cleaning and possible teeth removal. In addition, based on the blood test results, Boba is suspected to have some kidney concerns. Dr and staff educated us on the results and let us know about preventable treatment options. We scheduled Boba for her dental cleaning after she cleared the initial exam.Easy drop off for treatment. Treatment was completed. We picked up Boba and discuss the service charges. Although there were some concerns with the bill, they worked with us and we were able to resolved the service charges. Also, they went above and beyond by trimming Boba's nails. Appreciate that. We will be taking Boba back for urine testing to address the kidney concerns. Thanks again Katella Animal Clinic Dr. Kim and stafff.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjh0jKs8PsMAvqD7oCbwqe4S2ln-s10D9yqTSX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOp6MiS9EkAuNBrNNmIDV7bLi4-66kJk5rmtjd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6203MXDN3BEF-RBLAFfEXJC48nG_PCBD1PAp4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-cbaeoXFkDa1LIfcpM1Y-_rEWh2iLORdE9tea=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

They take care of our kittens like they were their own. We recently had them neutered/spayed. We had no problems and our cats were just fine afterwards. They called us the next day to check on them. I love that they care about the animals that they treat!< /Review>< username>

I have taken my dog here since moving to Anaheim in 2014. She loves them and they are always caring and professional. I board there for several days every couple months and she doesn’t mind going there. Its been a great experience for both of us.<//Review>

They were curbside only but friendly all the way. My sister and I brought in a dog and kitten. They were very thorough about what our pets needed and talked everything out with us. Also they helped us age the kitten and finally told us what was making the dog itch so much. Great customer service!!!<//text>

This is probably the worse place I’ve every experienced. They OVERCHARGE you like crazy. Charging me $880 when I found it someplace else for $350. Not only that but they have horrible reviews on yelp I should have seen all the money hungry things said about them. Not only that but they said consultation was free but when I said no to the service they said it will be $35 then. When I called different places they said it’s free still regardless if I go thru with the service or not I’m not obligated. I hope this place gets shut down but probably won’t with all the money they rob</Review>

<text>They helped neuter my russian blue mancoon mix and since then he hasnt been trying to be the big cat on the yard. So they did something right the first time around unlike with the other clinic i took my Bombay to who we then later had to take to another clinic. They also aren't all that pricey and are willing to work with people who donate for the bill if you cant fund it yourself!< /text>< time>

< Review>
DO NOT TAKE YOUR PET HERE  I took my dog there thinking it was a good place a friendly place. The first day everything was fine because we were there with my pup and we were able to see everything and they did a good job. Well the next day for grooming I took my dog and when we got him back he was a whole different dog like it was my dog yeah but he was odd he acted scared and just weird in general. The next day I started noticing many issues with him first of all he would bite anyone who tried to touch him like he was scared of human touch and he would cry out of no well we found out why there’s like this scrape on his head and there’s a bunch of small cuts on his body his balls are also a little cut his leg has a cut and he is just really panicky and it just puts me to tears when I see him because I know something happened to my dog when I wasn’t there and it hurts because we weren’t even able to see the process of my dog getting groomed so we have no idea in what things they did to him but what I do know and feel is that they did something to my dog because before we ever took him there he was absolutely fine and now he just has trust issues with humans and it’s just horrible that any creature had to go through that.< /Review>

I dropped them off for grooming, when I came back the dogs appeared wet on there backs but when I got home they had never washed them at all.. they said they owed me to grooms...

I love this clinic a lot!!! Excellent service and the staff are very helpful and outgoing. Prices are very good compared to different clinics and their doctor is very kind. Everyone there really cared for my little puppy and treated my little guy like their own. If you are deciding to go here I recommend it as one of the best clinics!!!</text>

<Text>I have been taking my Princess Penny here for 6 years. She is always happy to go here because they treat her like royalty. Dr. Saleeb is great with my dog and me. He takes time to explain to me any treatment and options. And who else gives you a Follow-up call to check on your pet. I'd pay double for the Personal Service we get here.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<text>Thank you Katella animal clinic for the best care I ever received.  I brought my doggies over for boarding and it was such an excellent experience.  I left him for a  month and when I came back he was healthy, happy, and did not even miss me.  the entire staff was so amazing and caring.
I picked him up clean and happy.

also, not to mention the staff and doctors really showed a great interest in my pet.  I will always come to Katella animal clinic and make sure all my friends know about this clinic

not to mention, the prices was so great and very affordable for me< /text><user>116335466965989526576< /user>< response>

<text>I love this place! Recently my dog was diagnosed with cancer and got so sick I had to have her put to sleep.  Everyone in the office were so kind and understanding. They went way beyond any other place I've ever heard of in helping me get my big dog to their office. I am older and disabled and I will be forever grateful to them for their kindness and help in getting me through this heartbreaking ordeal. Dr. Saleeb and all the staff are very special people!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I don't think I've ever been more frustrated. I brought my dog here for a second time since we had a great experience the first time. This time they charged us for everything and anything. We wanted to update his vaccinations and get him bathed and groomed. We also asked if they could look at the small irritated skin to be safe. The doctor "looked" at it and said they would do a test on it. When we get back to pick up our dog they say he has an infection and he needs to take 3 pills a day and spray it with medicine everyday. They also put a cone on my dog and tried to change me $15 for it. They charged me $30 for a "new client office visit" when all they did was look in his ears and ask us the same questions over and over. They charged us another $180 for vaccinations and 2 others things that didn't make sense. I tried to fight it but they said it was because of the services rendered. I will not be going back here after this visit. Most frustrating representative at the front office too.< /text>< Pics>

As a rescuer, I really appreciate Katella's assistance with all my Veterinary needs including boarding, veterinary assistance, surgeries, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical needs. Stephanie, the staff and the Vet's are first class and the prices very fair and reasonable. I am not close geographically but for my animals, they make it worth the drive. Thanks Katella and staff!< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><text>We have been going to Katella Animal Clinic for more than 14 years with our dogs.  We appreciate the way they respect, care and love our dogs.  We love our dogs like family, but realize they are dogs....and sometimes difficult decisions need to be made due to financial stress (2 children going to college).  Like a thousand dollar (approximation) procedure to a 13 year old dog or 'putting the loved dog down".  They do not push us into a decision we can not afford and are very understand and supportive in these difficult choices.

We will continue to bring my beloved pets to them....<//text>< gmapID>

<rating>1</rating><name>KKelly Bui< /name><text>NEVER BRING YOUR DOG HERE unless you want your dog to suffer and you ended up paying more than you should.  This office is old and the exam room is dirty.  The service was very slow even thought I was the only customer at the time (and I had the appointment too), I still have to wait 45 minutes to see the doctor.
I took my dog to this place because I just bought insurance through my work place for my dog.  My insurance only allows me to visit this office or other offices in Tustin.  My dog has fleas and she was scratching herself.  When they checked her in, they recommend us to give my dog vaccines too.  I walked out with $288 (it was $385 but I got 25% saving) bill.  They also pressured me to Have my dog do the teeth cleaning for $485, luckily I said I will think about it.  30 minutes after I left this place, my dog started to have shortness of breath and she kept sticking her out.  She also scratched herself like crazy.  I called the office and they told me to bring my dog back in again.  They said she had allergic reaction to the vaccine.   My dog got vaccinated every year (for the past 6 years) at Garden Grove Dog & Cat hospital and she never got any allergic reaction.  Anyway I brought het back in the same day, they did a blood test and gave her a shot.  They kept her for two hours to monitor her.  I pickup my dog around 5:30pm the same day and they told me her blood test was fine.  They charged me another $144.  When I got my dog  in my car, she had pooped and urine on her tail.  It got on my clothes and car seat.  They didn’t even clean her before they discharged her.  Around 7:00 pm, my dog started to have bumps all over her body and she kept biting herself like crazy again.This place is ripoff and it caused us lots of frustration and headache.  My dog was in more bad shape than before we took her here.  I am so regretted to take her to this hospital.  It’s my biggest mistake.  This placed charged me more for vaccines (at leat double to triple the cost) than any other hospitals that I took my dog in the past, even with my insurance discount.  I will never bring my dog here again.

I will bring my dog to Garden Grove Dog and Cat hospital tomorrow to have them check out my dog.< /text>< Pictures>

<gmap_id>0x80dd28382606f8e1:0x463a61f8007c38e8< /gmap_id><Review>Our normal healthy dog passed away after one night boarding at the clinic. While we're still waiting to test his blood to check for anything suspicious, the fact is that only the vet tech (I believe his name was as Danny) was helpful. He was empathetic, and very helpful and caring.

The nurse or whoever she was seemed to think I was being unreasonable about being upset about not only a normal dog dying suddenly while in their care, but also because I was angry that she seemed to think "I don't know, maybe it was just god" was an acceptable answer. Her only concern seemed to be trying to make sure that they looked as innocent as possible - calling my dog "frail" (he wasn't), and referring to him as the "old German Shepherd" and saying she hadn't seen shepherds live past 14 - my dog was only 8.

Whether they were negligent or not (we're still waiting to see), she was terrible, and the fact remains that my dog died overnight while in their care. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.</Review></record>

Dr Saleeb has cared for my pugs for over 10 years.  He is a very caring person and loves my 3 babies!  He has provided excellent care for my pugs and his staff is also very caring and attentive.  I am sorry that I now live too far to be able to keep Dr. Saleeb as our vet.  I highly recommend Katella Animal Clinic to everyone!< /text>

Dr Saleeb is very caring with our dogs. One of our dogs becomes very anxious when we take her to the vet and has seizures. Dr Saleeb comes to our car to check on her and give her shots. He is worth the drive, and I especially love that he will personally call us after our visit to check on our girls to see how they're doing!<//Review>

Our normal healthy dog passed away after one night boarding at the clinic. While we're still waiting to test his blood to check for anything suspicious, the fact is that only the vet tech (I believe his name was as Danny) was helpful. He was empathetic, and very helpful and caring.

The nurse or whoever she was seemed to think I was being unreasonable about being upset about not only a normal dog dying suddenly while in their care, but also because I was angry that she seemed to think "I don't know, maybe it was just god" was an acceptable answer. Her only concern seemed to be trying to make sure that they looked as innocent as possible - calling my dog "frail" (he wasn't), and referring to him as the "old German Shepherd" and saying she hadn't seen shepherds live past 14 - my dog was only 8.

Whether they were negligent or not (we're still waiting to see), she was terrible, and the fact remains that my dog died overnight while in their care. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.< /review>

Found out that she had to poop in her own bed multiple times, and the lady handed me & said it was an accident, what a liar. I could tell my dog was inside the crate for the whole time and was not walked around at all. My dog had to poop soo bad and started pooping as soon as i picked her up and was pooping all day.

Mind you, I have been to several other places in the Orange County area and no one beats Katella Animal Clinic's kindness, passion, and love for animals.
All the staff are super kind to me and my cats. I am always welcomed and cared for. They always try to accommodate my pets whether its to see the doctor, to do grooming, etc. I REALLY appreciate how kind they are to my two kitties. Their prices are unbeatable!
Last week I had brought in my cats for dental cleaning. The receptionists were kind and respectful to my questions. They reassured my that my cats would be fine. A couple hours later I got a call from the doctor and was super pleased with his patience with me. He explained that he had extracted a couple teeth and that they would be going home with some pain management and antibiotics. I came to pick them up and the same receptionist was there and explained everything to me once again. My cats had beautiful teeth! Very very good job by the clinic! My cats were perfectly fine after and better than ever!

Not only are they kind with my pets but they also have big hearts for rescued animals. I had recently chimed in on a conversation at the clinic and found out that they deal with several rescues for cats and dogs! One of the transporters was saying that several rescued pets come from the shelter and they are transformed completely after they come to Katella Animal Clinic. The rescued pets are taken care from A to Z.

It is amazing to see that there are still good people out there and Katella Animal Clinic definitely has them!

Super proud to call them my FAMILY before VET!</Text><Time>1500434002562< /Time>< username>

i finally found a clinic that is so wonderful and caring
their prices are vey affordable and within my budget
when my dog got  sick and i was visiting my mother, i had to look for someone that is so close to help.
i googled and found Katella Animal Clinic, and my experience there was outstanding
i highly recommend this place to everyone in town
i live around 55 miles away, but do not mind at all the drive to come and see Dr Saleeb
my dog got better just few minutes after they saw him and when went home
i gave him the medications, he took it and start playing and wiggling his tail
and start jumping up and down my lap.

i love Katella Animal clinic and will never go anywhere else.

thanks you clinic</text>

He was also wearing loafers at work. like I said maybe this is just a 1 off to their normal service, as it seems this place has high reviews, but I was very dissatisfied with the results. I will not be returning to this clinic, nor will I be recommending it to others.< /Review><Date>1322092151970</Date>< Pictures>

<text>From my Wife
Please Do Not Take YOUR PET HERE
I did a working interview at this place several years ago (didnt take the job based on pay rate) and gave them a call since my normal vet is out til the 16th.

Absolutely shameful. Took my dog in with bloodwork, xray and an urine analysis from another vet not even 24 hours from one another my dog is DEAD after 10 years of COMPANIONSHIP

Dr. Saleeb/ Eva said the bloodwork showed on the high side regarding liver and highly suggested both a liver medication & another type of antiobiotic because the one prescribed less than 24 hours ago wasn't strong enough.

They also said my dog WAS strong enough to withstand surgery and said it was a good idea to high risk sedate my 10 year old pug to remove to kidney stones that had previously blocked his urination...that it would be okay, they had done this SO many times before..i had to sign to waivers one because he was old and another because of his breed which is a Pug

So EVA hops on the phone and has to schedule the surgery with another doctor because Dr. Salleeb  doesn't know how to do the procedure.

Dr. Salleeb verbally told me in the office on Friday evening that he wouldn't be able to do it because the dog wouldn't have enough recoup time on Saturday that it would have to be Monday.

Super confusing experience from start to finish.

EVA wanted to board my dog overnight which is unnecessary  considering there's NO ONE there to watch or tend to the animals. (Really bc they wanted that $$$$)

She told me because of his age they would start the IV first thing in the a.m. etc.

I called at 8:30 a.m. Saturday morning to see if Iv fluid had been started.  PER EVA it had not been started and would tentatively be started within the next 30 minutes being 9oclock. Not sure why my dog needed to be boarded over night when no one is there and fluids weren't started as previously discussed.

TRUTHFULLY they ran my card for the procedure in full that evening over the phone. I was there for 3 hours discussing in circles with Dr. Saleeb and EVA.

They were suppose to give my dog his liver medication and other medication which they profusely advised me getting for him.

Got home and noticed after I picked Bruno up neither package had been opened and neither medication had been administered even though they were SO adamant about his liver function.

They wanted me to leave my dog over night in a metal cage and act like they were doing me a favor  by boarding him overnight.

*****EVA advised me the clinic would be charged if I didn't show the next day for surgery*****

EVA gave zero discharge instructions but managed to charge me 93 dollars worth of dog food for my dog that is now DEAD..AND overcharged me for it.

They also gave him a bath and trimmed his nails and charged me for it..

This place is DEADLY STAY AWAY

Save your MONEY & yourself some HEARTACHE

I'm more than happy to attach invoices since that's the only paperwork I got from the high risk procedure

EVA also advised to take my dog to hospital or home my call

If you love your pet you'll go to someone who does too..this place DOES NOT CARE</text><rating>1</rating>< GmapID>

On March 7 I took my dog in due to his constant vomiting and his unwillingness to eat. They took TWO X-rays and a blood screening. The X-rays did not show anything and the doctor said my dog had air around his abdomen. I was also told he had Kidney Failure and would probably have to have him on a special diet and care. He stayed at the clinic for two days and was given I.V fluids and the doctors never gave me updates, only the receptionist who would constantly have to ask the techs or doctor of his status. By Thursday afternoon my sister and went to the clinic to speak to a doctor, they rushed to get the blood results that took more then 24 hours to obtained, and informed me my dog's blood was clear of any infection. They allowed me to take him home with medication that consisted of Antibiotics, I.V Fluids and to assist him in his appetite. After three days my dog showed no improvement, and I took him back to the clinic  and I finally met with Dr. Saleeb whom took full responsibility of the decisions made for the care of my dog. Within the 5 minutes I speaking to him he asked me three times the age of my dog, and three times I responded to his question, in which he constantly called him "Baby" and that is not his name. He gave me additional medication for his lack of appetite. By then I had spent over a $1000.00 and had seen no improvement in my dog. My poor dogs condition got extremely worse two days later, so I took him to the GARDEN GROVE CAT & DOG HOSPITAL. No cost for the exam, took ONE X-RAY and found a fruit pit lodged in his intestine, his blood results showed NO EVIDENCE of KIDNEY FAILURE, in fact it was clean. My dog was operated that same afternoon. He was hospitalized two days and EVERY MORNING I got an update from the doctor himself. My dog is now completly recovered and back to his hyper self. KATELLA ANIMAL CLINIC ALMOST KILLED MY DOG, because they were more interested in getting money out of me than caring for the well being of my dog. They only star I give is for the kind staff.  I've been told to seek a lawyer for the pain and suffering my dog and I have gone through, definitely reporting to the medical board. IF you care for your pet, DO NOT GO TO KATELLA ANIMAL CLINIC, you will put their life in jeapordy.</review>

<review>Boarded my dogs here three times and every time they came out covered in feces and urine.. When I complained I was told that it's not their fault if the dog walks through their own fecal matter.

One of my dogs was spayed here and I was given no aftercare instructions which led to a night of nonstop vomiting.. When I picked her up post surgery she also had urine and fecal matter on her. Abhorrent for a dog who just had surgery and has a fresh incision.

Staff is a rude and completely unaccommodating. Not sure why the Google reviews are so high, yelp tells a more accurate story of this clinic.</review><user_id>115762734290456372328< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80dd28382606f8e1:0x463a61f8007c38e8< /gmap_id><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Katella Animal clinic is not my usual vet for my doggie but a few days ago my baby vomiting and having unusual diarrhea then noticed a small bump on the side of his rectum. I recently had this similar issue with my other dog i was sure it was an anal gland abcess. And I knew if I waited over night it would become worse so the only vet open and in my area at the time was Katella Animal clinic. I really regret going there! Immediately they insisted on doing blood work and he needed a shot and was going to need surgery the next day. So I was given 3 different medications and was charger 300.00$ JUST for those services. I brought him to have surgery the next day picked him up and never received any type of after care or instructions 500.00$ later!!!!..my dog had had small but several complications since then and they charge me AGAIN every time I go back in not to mention the doctor is rude and a complete idiot! To find out this last visit I will be paying another 40$ to remove the stiches ffrom the surgery!! Its unbelievable and I highly do not recommend this clinic!!!< /review>

Horrible experience neither me or my dog liked it. She whined the whole time which is unlike her . I am assuming she was whining because when we walked in dogs in the back were howling and sounded unhappy. The vet was a lady who freaked when my dog jumped up to great her and made me hold the dog while she looked in her ears. Isn't that their job? While swabbing my pets ears she was super rough unlike what ive seen before or done myself. Id figure they would treat animals with care but no. Also her english was horrible and she didn't know how to answer most my questions re: my dog health.I waited 30 minutes for about 5 minutes of service and a bill over $200 to get my pet the shots and ect she needed. I will be visiting a different vet tomorrow to get adequate care for my pet. The place is small and smells as well.<//review>

<Review>Took my German Shepherd in for some vaccination. He isn't too well with people and pets (proper training planned in the near future). As other vets would give me dirty looks and attitude and look at my pup as if he were a killer, this place knew what I was going through. Made me very comfortable with the fact that I'm not the best trainer and my pup isn't an honor student. Their staff cleared the way for me and my dog to stroll in. I originally went in for only a rabies shot, but ended getting a full round of vaccinations since the price was very affordable for a 24 yr old. I absolutely trust this place with my boy. I finally found the perfect vet for me. Thanks a bunch.</Review><name>Matthew Childers<//name><time>1329794426918<//time>< rating>

Terrible Clinic. While I was there, I saw multiple angry customers interacting with an indifferent staff. Follow up care was terrible as well.

I found this clinic when my dog ate a chicken bone out of the trash. My experience was mediocre, with nothing noteworthy in the good or bad side. I then headed back home to San Jose.

After that, it was like pulling teeth trying to get my records and a copy of my invoice from them for my pet insurance carrier. To date, almost a year later I have not been successful after repeated attempts both by myself and insurance company. The staff has been indifferent at best, to down right nihilistic about the prospect of me getting records from them.< /Text>

<Review>Very friendly staff and Dr. Took care of my baby when I just moved to Anaheim and he needed shots. Then again when he had the flu and was very congested.
Only thing I didn't like was that they were low on antibiotics and the girl at the counter made me pay for 10 day supply $85, and only gave me 3 day supply and told me to come back. When I asked for written Rx to get then elsewhere I was told no.</Review>< userid>

I had the worst haircut in my life by a barber named Ronnie. BE AWARE THIS BARBER HAS REALLY BAD ATTITUDE. First of all I walked in and he was sleeping in his chair. They told me he was next so I went with him. I asked and made sure for a low fade and got a high fade. The whole time he was having a conversation with the other barber and every sentence he uses the F word , sometimes he would stop the haircut for minutes to continue his conversation. Apparently the conversation is more important than his customers. The way he uses his clippers even a student doesn't . He was hitting the clippers in my head I even had severe headache after. After the haircut he showed me in the mirror and despite that I didn't get the haircut I wanted  I saw lines everywhere,  I asked him politely  to touch up something and he refused. Very unprofessional I had to go somewhere else after to fix it. I have never gotten out of my way to leave a bad review for a barber but this one was really bad both haircut and attitude.<//Text>

<Text>I don't have short hair right now, but watching the barbers work, I can see they are very skilled and the environment definitely caters very much to men. My partner came here for a haircut, a beard trim to match, and had his eyebrows done here. Flawless work.< /Text><name>Tracy Yang<//name><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
For the past month ive been telling my boyfriend to go here they give great hair cuts what i heard from a friend...... Well he finally does and it barely looked like he did...the Berber that did it forgot to cut his hair at the edge on top of his ear there was uneven hair spots all over his head it was the worst haircut I've ever seen him get. I give him a better haircut than that.<//Review>

First time coming to this place to get a cut and it turned out bad my "Line Up" was way too high because he messed up in the first place. The barber tried to fix it but it was worse. The barbers need to pay more attention instead of looking to the TV<//review>

<Text>Now before I walked into fade factory I had been disappointed with my barbers from other shops being unwilling to take their time and give a A1 quality cut since I arrived in San Diego(but charging A1 prices.) I decided to go into fade factory. I got my hair cut by Max. He took his time and did a great job as he exceeded expectations. He was great in understanding the look I wanted. He reminded me of the old school barbers. He takes pride and loves what he does. Also he is a good dude as he gives back to the community and I respect that a lot. Its good to see a company and its employees doing the right thing.  You got a repeat customer. See you in 2 weeks.<//Text>< Pics>

There is a lot of things that go unnoticed in the barber game. MAX is a very experienced barber that has love for the craft. As a barber shop we want to always have the old school feel that is why we try so hard to make sure all of our locations have antique barber chairs because every haircut is a reminder for us of the responsibility we have for our community.

Amazing place to get a cut. I read reviews on here and made me a tad bit worried about what to expect. My first visit, I went in after work to take my 5 year old son and myself to get a quick cut before his soccer game. Very little wait as the shop since it was around dinner time. Everyone was very friendly and made my son and I feel welcomed, they even turned on a movie for my son to watch as I got my cut. The cuts came out great, prices were comparable to other barbershops (I've been to hundreds across the country). I highly recommend this shop.< /text>

I've gotten hair cuts from three different barbers here (all good haircuts). Ask for Daniel, he'll hook you up with a great haircut and leave you pondering on interesting government conspiracy theories. Can't go wrong here.</Review>

Been a long time since I stepped foot in a barbershop. I usually do it myself.

To be honest I asked the barber to cut my hair a certain way, and he did the exact opposite. I'm not one to complain, but I feel the honest criticism is needed. I am now about to go another barber to fix what the Fade Factory barber messed up, (which is going to cost another $15-20). He left a big patch of hair on my sideburns area, and the sides are not faded evenly at all. Highly noticeable! I still tipped the guy, out of courtesy. They were nice though, well I believe the owner was at least, if I'm correct.
God bless< /review>

I walked in to get a haircut as I usually do at fade factory but this time I was literally skipped twice And I waited about 2 hours to finally get a cut. To make things worse barber Mike Hamilton was giving me attitude and did not give me the haircut I wanted. I will continue going as part of loyalty but I expect better service next time.< /review>

<Text>Asked for a medium fade and this girl gave me a very high skin fade. I asked for nothing off the top but ended up having to because the fade was so high. And then put gel in my hair without asking if I wanted it. Even showed her where to fade it to and it was obviously ignored. Thanks.<//Text>< Pictures>

Ronie is a good guy and gave an awesome cut and shave!  The Fade Factory customer service was excellent. I was in San Diego for a conference and needed a quality cut right away. Brotha’s know how scary going to a new barber can be! Ronie didn’t disappoint. Heck! I may consider flying to SD from Maryland anytime I need a cut...well, maybe after I reach balla status!  Check out this review on Yelp as well.<//Review>

{'time': 1535700829566, 'text': 'Hi sir, i was the “barber” that spoke to you outside. I happen to be the owner and manager in charge at the time you visited us. I spoke to you outside for some period of time after your son received the haircut and we did not take that much time on your son. We managed to cut over 500 people that weekend because it was back to school this past monday. I remember you very well and you seemed like you were very agitated about other reasons you didnt inform me of besides our “wait time “ you where the only person mad that day, and was complaining about everything which is ok, you have your right to voice your opinion and speak your mind. We love feedback and we appreciate because it makes us better. Our chairs are the best and most expensive kind in he barber business. I really dont know what you meant by the chair was “uncomfortable” our chairs range from 3k-5k per chair and where custom made to insure ultimate confort.  I remember you very well, we reviewed the cameras and the haircut took under 45 min to complete. You also informed me of a disability after the haircut that you never made us AWARE of that MOST parents ALWAYS inform us PRIOR to the haircut. I sincerely and strongly apologize if you felt that particular barber had a bad attitude, i happen to work next to the man, and I was there the entire time he cut your sons hair. I didnt hear or see any bad attitude but to not argue with you or contradict you as a customer I gave you a free product on the house because you stated “the haircut is good but i just wish i didnt have to wait so long” i tried to provide customer satisfaction by giving you a $18 product for free because there was nothing i could do on the haircut your issue was our wait time. That day we had 12 barbers working and where extremely busy we even had people waiting outside. Sorry you feel like we have a bad a attitude believe me we are a very family oriented business that loves what we do. Every day we wake up happy to service our customers that bring us positive vibes to continue to do what we love to do.'}<//Response>

Not a kid friendly place. Sing in at 3:15  it only took 10 minutes to get called  into a very uncomfortable rised kid chair with very little back support. The barber was rude from the beginning  I only heard from him mmm, ok, $25 and what's the problem, the whole time I was there
It took him 1hour and 14 minutes to cut a 4 year old hair. He was more interested on changing the music and  being on the phone and goofing around with the other barbers than cutting hair. Not once he cleaned or swept the hairs away from my kids face until they got in my kids eyes the last 14 minutes it was when my kid started rubbing his eyes and all I saw was the baber  bad attitude like if it was my kids fault for trying to clean his eyes. Not once did he even said a word or paid any attention to him.
The other thing why do they even have a price chart if they just going to charge you whatever they want he charged me $25  for the hair cut. only one of the other barbers noticed I was upset and tried explaining me that   he probably was on his phone so much to change the music that's not appropriate for kids,  and then the barber came very upset asking what was the problem I just told him it was ok but won't come back at all

I understand some people don't like dealing with kids and  it's ok but I think they should let you  know before they sit you down. I prefer to wait 5 more minutes for some one that would  have a better attitude</review>

This place has poor customer service. We took our son to get a haircut and we were not acknowledged when we walked in. There were 2 barbers. One was working and the other was having a conversation and stopping every 2 minutes to talk. Spent 5 minutes talking and went back to cutting hair. We waited for 20min and left. Never going back.<//Text>

We have had that experience where customers leave due to our high wait times and they end up coming back to fix what the "other barber" at this "other place" did. We will be really happy to see you give us another oppurtunity we are so confident you are going to like our haircut that we are willing to invite you to visit us again ! Thanks'}</resp>

<Name>Osito Rican</Name><review>*4.75 stars

This place fails to disappoint me. Eddie (Osiel) has been my barber the last 2 times I went. He's a perfeccionist and takes his time with you and you leave looking and feeling great. I write this not only about how he takes care of me but as I have observed him take care of others.  The other barbers seem to be on their game as well.  Just saw one take care of a 2 year old, which is veey difficult and it seemed like a breeze. Kid looked sharp with no crying and minimal help from his dad that was standing by.

All in all this place is great.  They keep it clean and the music and banter between the barbers makes it that much more fun and relaxing.   They have 2 big flat screen TVs in case you gotta wait or play some old school video games (Ms Pac Man,  Galaga, etc)

* Now if I had to criticize this place it would be because of the bathroom. It's always clean BUT always out of soap. They have hand sanitizer at some of the barber stations but nothing beat soap and watee ro prevent the spread of germs. However in all fairness this place is pretty busy and not every client is mindful and may abuse the use of the bathroom.  I'll ding them a 1/4 star for that.</review>< response>

Don't bother to make an appointment, because when you came in, they still do "first come first serve." I'm a busy person that's why I made an appointment. I don't like the customer service here. I haven't got my haircut at all. I am supposed to be a newbie here, and it's a disappointment.</Text>

{'time': 1514953055678, 'text': 'We have a WARNING sign in regards to our long wait. We are very busy most of the time and we apologize if we had a high demand for services and which most likely made your appointment with us late. We try to be very punctual but in a service driven industry we dont move on with our next customer until every single demand and expectation has been met with every single customer. Sometimes service times vary depending on each customer and their needs which is why we try to encourage our Customers to book online so we have your service desired documented previously and we have a better understanding of your needs prior to walking in. We are a very successful barber shop that tries very hard to treat everyone equally and provide nothing but the best service and products.'}</Response>

My younger brother came in for a haircut, and came out with the worse haircut I have ever seen. He was pritty upset, and so was I. If you can't cut black people hair then don't do it, that's fine, be honest and say you can't do it, don't just do it because you want the money.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Absolutely amazing. You could use every positive adjective and never fully describe this place. And the pictures, you could post 100 and still not show it all. The hike is easy and worth the time. Walker road comes up very quickly on 199 and you need to be ready to turn. The drive to the end of walker road is a little rough but worth the time as well< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Short educative trail, includes access to a creek with small water stream. Amazing for kids as they can climb on the many fallen trees. Access to the Smith river is just a short drive (or even walk) from the trailhead, and another beautiful grove is just across the main road. Wonderful place for just a 30 minute walk if you rush it, or the whole afternoon if you take your time and visit the other places too.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Beautiful trail it’s an easy flat walk for most abilities. There are markers along the path so it felt educational for my daughter. Trail is located behind the bathrooms and there are pullouts for parking.</review>

Hard gravel 4-5ft in width. Wheelchair accessible with, I think it was 3 or 4 handicapped parking spots. Accessible outhouse style toilets with a concrete floor and raised oval toilets and plenty of TP. Accessed on Walker Rd off of Hwy 199 near Crescent City, CA. Very worth it. Old growth Redwoods, creek with accessible bridges. Free. My favorite. I live in Brookings and come here regularly. Best to come when the sun is high.<//review>

<text>A nice trail to see the Redwood trees up close.  A good trail for the whole family.   No inclines of any kind on the trail, just big trees!

If you have never taken the time to walk up and introduce yourself to one of these trees that lives for over 2000 years, you are missing out!<//text>< response>

Very nice and easy trail. It has 2 of the really big redwood trees. It's a double loop trail. Mostly flat with a few minimal ups and downs. For those who have little kids, in my opinion, this trail is doable with a sturdy stroller (especially those big wheelers made for running and outdoors).< /Review>

Beautiful hiking trails that are accessible for most. I've taken the little ones there and can easily get a stroller around with no problem. We even took my father in law and he walked well over a mile with us with no complaints because of how much he was enjoying himself.<//text>

Glorious redwood trail. You can't believe how really big they are. Self guided signage tell the story as you walk a gentle mile or so. Good parking and bathrooms are there.<//text>

A beautiful and easy walk trail. In a very good location as the trail head is on highway 219 road side, and only 10 min away from crescent city hotels. It is very easy flat walk. Enjoyable by everyone</text>

The drive to this grove was absolutely beautiful, it felt like another land! The hike itself was so serene and quiet. We came a day after it rained and the water droplets on all the fern and moss made the experience even more out of this world! The redwoods in this grove were huge and old. A couple of nice bridges here with water running under make a lovely picture within the grove. Loved it here!</text></record></dataset><record>

If you have less than an hour,  this is a place to go and experience the magnificent redwood trees. Clean restroom,  mostly flat trails, less than a mile loop trail but you can go further with other connecting trails if you want. Get here early to get the best parking spot since it's limited.< /Review>

Easy access to the grove from the main highway.  Limited parking.  Very easy and level walk with signs explaining features along the way. You can extend your walk by including the Peterson trail.< /review>

Our introduction to the majestic redwoods, they did not disappoint. Absolutely breathtaking and abundant. A great trail and as a bonus roadway leads to a perfect riverside play area for the pups. As a starting point for our redwood adventure it was perfect. Nearby ranger station was fantastic as well. Rangers were friendly and extremely informative, obtained all the literature we needed for the remainder of our coastal excursions. Hugged many trees!<//Review>

There's a very stinky bathroom at the trailhead.< /review>

Easy trail. Stroller and wheelchair friendly. Fair amount of parking, shorter or longer loop trails, pit toilets, informational signs, wonderful trail. This is one of my favorite places on the planet.<//text>

Peaceful and serene. You get up close to the amazing redwoods. No steep climbs (up or down). Very level and well groomed. Right off of the highway, so it is not too far to drive in for a parking spot. One of the big highlights of our trip through California.</text><Name>Joseph Allen<//Name><Response>None</Response><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

<Text>I'm fortunate to live in the area and this is my go-to place to get away and get the dog out for an hour or two.  Easy , flat loop trail with some parking near the trailhead.  If you go on a weekday during the off season, there's a good chance you'll have the place to yourself.</Text>< pictures>

<text>They saved my guinea pig!
My guinea pig, Pinkie, was very sick, and was dying. The vets, and technicians were very calm when communicating the options of treatment. They made sure that my mom and I knew the risks and the benefits of treatment and they were with us through every step.
If it wasn't for Care Animal Hospital, I would be burying one of my best friends.
If you're looking for an exotic animal hospital, this is it! They're trustworthy, reliable, compassionate, and communicative! Dr. Murphy and his team are heaven-sent!
God Bless them!< /text><Name>Aaliyah Vaden<//Name><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80db7fb38a10df89:0xb22ffff234ae4e11<//gmapID><user>100432633714311184101< /user>< Rate>

She developed tail rot and an infection that made her beard swollen. Felt horrible as a new pet owner to see her in this condition. I called around several vets and went for something that was the most reasonably priced and that treated lizards. Care Animal Hospital was the best in initial exam fee. I took her in and they did great diagnosing her. She needed a small amputation and some antibiotics. They were able to do everything the same day and the cost was fair. This was a good experience and am more open to getting another pet knowing we have a good vet in town.< /Review></record>

The best exotics vet I've ever has the pleasure of working with. Doctor Brian Murphy and staff were absolute fantastic.  I brought in a very sickly boa constrictor who I was rescuing. She was in very bad shape and the magic the staff were able to work with her was amazing. I will be using Care Animal hospital for all my pets not just exotics. Thank you everyone.< /text>

Very compassionate.  We just received a sympathy card in the mail from them saying sorry about our Penelope having to be put down. I recommend this place to everyone. I will definitely take my other pets there if needed for anything else. Thank you guys!!< /review>< user_id>

<text>We've been going to Care Animal Hospital for 20 years with our dogs. Dr. Alcorn is amazing - takes time to do proper examinations, hear our concerns and fully explain the best course of action. He doesn't just rush from patient to patient.  The staff there are amazing too - we feel like family. Highly highly recommend.</text><user_id>113259739474549827064</user_id><GmapID>0x80db7fb38a10df89:0xb22ffff234ae4e11</GmapID></record>

<Text>I brought my parakeet in because he was acting not himself and seemed ill. Dr Alcorn said that he seemed healthy for the most part and he sent me home with antibiotics that you put in water and hope they drink it. He was not getting better so l tried repeatedly to speak with Dr.Alcorn and was told that l couldn't and it was not allowed.  I wanted to see if there was an injection he could have.
10 days later l had to euthanize him.  I was told then!!  that he had pneumonia!! I find out after the fact that he should have been hospitalized and treated with antibiotics with a nebulizer. I was very upset and angry because of the mis diagnosis and the fact that the office people were so unhelpful! I called them and told them so  and was told to never call again and not to come back because they didn't like the way I spoke to them! Like I would go back !
I have brought other birds there and was seen by Dr Murphy and was satisfied with him.

DO NOT LET DR.ALCORN TREAT YOUR BIRD!!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Great place to take your pet/pets. The Doctor and the staff from the front of the office to the back are very caring and so helpful! I had a great first time visit with my pet there. I will be taking my other dogs in the near future we found our new vet home!< /Review>

<text>We took our new guinea pigs who we got from petsmart who had respiratory issues first day home (petsmart does not offer anything if the pets u purchase are sick) . Care animal hospital made the no contact appointment process stress free. Dr. Murphy took incredible care of our babies and took plenty of time to answer any questions we had.  No pressure selling services or pushing procedures on us that we didn't need.  Dr. Murphy is knowledgeable,  professional and truly care about his patients.  Highly recommend him to anyone with fur babies 😍 Dr. Murphy is the best!!!!!!<//text>< pics>

Owning rats, it's hard to find vets who will work with them, but when our Willow got sick, Dr. Joe Alcorn gave her a thorough check up and prescribed the medicine she needed. The whole staff was incredibly helpful from scheduling an appointment, to instructing us, and following up on Willow's wellbeing. Thanks Care Animal Hospital! We appreciate you!<//Review>

Really really impressed with the quality of this vet. I saw Dr. Murphy who was really sharp and understanding. Took the time to listen to my concerns and managed the issue effectively. Lisa was also extremely caring and helpful throughout the process. Kathi at the front, also very kind and helpful. Cost effective too. Finding trustworthy and cost effective vet has been difficult in the past so I was extremely happy to find it here. Highly recommend.<//Text>

I frantically searched the web for veterinary dentist there were no openings for 2 weeks out. By the grace of God I found Care Animal Hospital and Dr. Alcorn. I was able to get Doc in the very next morning. The care, the companion, knowledge and skill level were outstanding. The staff is wonderful; polite, pleasant and professional. I'm from Boston so naturally I just assume superior medical care can only be obtained there... I was wrong, the surgery and medical care I received at Care Animal Hospital was the best I could have received anywhere on earth.<//Review>< pictures>

Since moving to Temecula in 2002, CARE Animal Hospital has taken care of all our veterinary needs. The staff is professional, caring, courteous and keeps us informed. We especially like the fact that CARE is an accredited of memeber of AAHA and has to regularly pass onsite evaluation for hospital and veterinary services.
They are a 5 Star organization. SonShine Mays</Review>

I went to Care Animal Hospital for one of our family pets. He is a Guinea pig named Mikey. Somehow he ended up with some for of mites which was pretty much causing him to scratch and bite and tear through is flesh leaving  really bad lacerations. He was suffering. I called and scheduled an appointment and they took me right away. I actually had to cancel and walked in on a Saturday and  it did not take long at all. Mikey was seen in a timely manner. The doctor diagnosed him and treated him immediately. I am going back tomorrow for a follow up treatment. Mike is doing so much better and is no longer scratching or suffering. I recommend Care Animal Hospital. They did a great job and were very friendly  and helpful. THANK YOU!</review>

I am so happy to have found Care Animal Hospital. I will never take my box turtle Harley anywhere else! My expectations were exceeded. The office was clean and well organized . The front desk was very friendly and helpful. They genuinely care about their patients. I was hesitant to bring Harley in after having a horrific experience at All Creatures animal hospital. At Care Animal Hospital my worries were put at ease. The Dr. took his time with Harley and the vet tech was so knowledgeable and kind. I can say now I look forward to future visits with Harley at this office. :) For this I am truly thankful.<//review>

< Review>
This is the BEST vet in the Temecula Valley!! We first went to them a year ago with a sick class guinea pig who sadly passed while we were there to see if we could save her. The staff was INCREDIBLY nurturing and helpful in allowing us to process it all (my children were with me). They even sent a sorrow card after our visit to check on us and make sure we were ok. From that point I knew this was our vet!

Fast forward a year later, we have 2 of our own guinea pigs, and one of them appeared to have the beginning of an eye infection. We are in the middle of this "stay home" quarantine but I knew this needed to be addressed as soon as possible. Called CARE and they got us an appointment the next day, AND following all state guidelines to remain at safe distances, they have their office closed and have staff come to the car to take pets in so there is no waiting room/possibility of being in close proximity with other patient's parents. The visit was a seamless "drive-up" and truly I could not be more grateful for the love and attention they give to their patients. HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for a vet in the valley!<//Review>

We brought in my daughters pet rodent due to a nasty infection in her right leg. They were able to see her the next day. Staff and vet were very friendly and gentle with “Nebula”. Got her checked out and Vet sent antibiotics and pain meds home with us. That night she was feeling well better. They called us to check up on her. We went back a week later for a follow up. She was doing great and Vet gave us a few more days of antibiotics. I highly recommend this practice for the staff and the care of exotic pets!<//review>

We used their boarding service. They require an exam if your pet hasn’t been to their office previously. The cost was reasonable, they got us in quickly, and the staff was great. The vet himself was honest and didn’t try to sell things. When we got our fur baby back he was calm, happy, and well-groomed. We will definitely be using them again.</Review>

I found a medium size parrot, and noticed it scratching a lot, and loosing a large amount of feathers on a daily basis. In researching online, I concluded it had bird mites and proceeded to look for a bird veterinarian. I came across this facility, and made an appointment. The office was a little tricky to find, but upon arrival it appeared clean and kept up. My review is mostly based on  their rates. I was assisted initially by the vet assistant, friendly, nice, and then by the young veterinarian gentleman, also very friendly and nice, and spent a good amount of time with me and my bird, and offered good follow up advice. I brought in a bag of a red mite I had caught on my bird's cage, but it either got out by the time I arrived, as we could not find it in the bag to confirm my bird had mites. I felt I had to really convince the assistant & Doctor that the bird had mites, as they really didn't do anything in the examination to confirm why the bird was itching & losing so many feathers. My dissatisfaction comes from not understanding how they can charge such high fees for first, the initial examination of $45.60, then a recommended beak, nail, and wing trim @ $88.35, and 1 of 3 scheduled injections for mites @ $53.68 each!! Grand total, first visit=$187.63! This is a bird! Not the size of a dog,  or a cat, and yet the fees are this high! This is the main reason people DO NOT take their pets to the Vet when the pet clearly needs medical attention! Pets suffer due to these high vet fees, as the normal person does not have these kind of funds to spend, even though they truly desire to help their pets feel better. Now, the big push is for recommending pet insurance, which they like clock work, sent me in the mail. This way the Vets can continue increasing their fees, knowing the insurance the Customer has will pay out. It's just like regular Health Insurance for people, a total Scam!   I want my bird to get better, and therefore I am committed to finish the next 2 rounds of injections that they recommended @ $53.68 each, more.  And F.Y.I. to Staff there, we, the Clients, can hear everything you are talking about while we are waiting for the doctor in those rooms. I would suggest you keep your private conversations about your love life relationships, just that, private, and to be discussed during non business, or lunch time hours.< /Text>

There is absolutely no way that my experience could have been better. Every staff member I spoke to was amazing and did their best to answer all my questions and care for my hamster. Lauren, Madison, and Kathy were all amazing and Dr. Alcorn really knows what he’s doing and talking about. Thank you so much to everyone there. They had to preform surgery on my Russian dwarf hamster and so far, everything is going well. I couldn’t have asked for a better doctor or team to take care of Aji :)<//text>

Care Animal Hospital is fantastic! They are knowledgeable with our Bearded Dragon. They have taken care of her since we first got her and have helped us to understand how to take care of her properly. The staff is professional and very sweet. They are available when we need them and they always treat our pet with dignity and patience. We are so glad to have found this treasure.<//Review>

< Review>
I brought my guinea pigs here for a check up. The receptionist on the phone was helpful when making my appointment. When we got there, the wait time was short. Overall, they were friendly, affordable, and competent. They really know what they are doing and what they are talking about, unlike some vets I've been to. They are clearly experienced with guinea pigs, too. They seem to genuinely care about the animals. I had such a great experience that I will be bringing my dogs here now, too.

Oh, and I really appreciated how they didn't pressure me to pay for any expensive tests or treatments. They presented the options and allowed me to choose. Some vets can be very pushy or make you feel guilty for not doing certain treatments, but not so here. That's how I could tell they care more about their clients than making as much money as possible.< /Review>

I would like to thank the team at care animal hospital for doing everything they can to help our hamster, peanut pull through. Although peanut did not make it, Care Animal hospital did follow ups after our first visit to check if there was good progress. Care Animal hospital does an awesome job and they truly do what is in the best interest of the animals in their care.< /Text>

I brought my 6 week old kitten in for a well check and was happily greeted and only had to wait a few minutes.  The hospital is very clean and seems well organized.  I go back in 2 weeks for her shots.  Since being there, they have followed-up with a thank you card and reminder postcard for future visits.  I liked these people and this place right away.< /text>

They have always been very helpful to me and very very courteous when it came to my best friend coming in! They understood what my dog meant to me and took very good care of him whether he was sick or just needed to be updated on his shots in helping to keep them with an nice long healthy life. My dogs recently passed away and nothing as far as their helpfulness and courtesy changed and helping me and getting him cremated but even before then when I allowed my pet to pass away in his environment before I took him in to handle the final Arrangements. When I brought him in they allowed me and my family time to go into a room alone with him to say goodbye for as long as we needed! Just a few days after I received a very warm heartfelt card from them pertaining to my pet. I have been there throughout the years and their care has always been the same if not greater each time around so a big thank you to them for all the help they gave me during my pet's life!<//Review>

<Text>I would like to thank the team at care animal hospital for doing everything they can to help our hamster, peanut pull through. Although peanut did not make it, Care Animal hospital did follow ups after our first visit to check if there was good progress. Care Animal hospital does an awesome job and they truly do what is in the best interest of the animals in their care.< /Text>< resp>

<Review>Been going to Dr. Alcorn for 25+ years. He is the best!! Always takes the time to explain your pet's issues and what treatment entails without any pressure to move forward. It is always up to the owner. The staff is excellent, especially Kathy, who has been there for many years and runs the show. Highly recommended!!

I brought my puppy in this morning at 10:30am and after a very long wait because I was a walk in and they were very busy we seen the dr. The nurse came in first and kissed my puppy and just loved on him like he was hers!! After waiting another 30-45 min for the dr he was so very nice and helped my puppy so much. I have never felt so much love from a vet than I did here!! I drive a hour to get there but I would do it again and again this is now my go to vet!! Not only did they help my puppy they helped me with my 2 year old daughter as she was super cranky for being there so long they gave her little stuffed toys and everything!! I couldn’t ask for better service and compassion.. thank you so much. Love dinlas and the Rodriguez family!!< /review>

<text>~MAKE SURE TO CHECK ALL PRICES NO MATTER THE TASK~ Everyone was super nice and I loved the doctor.  Unfortunately, they wanted 120$ for a nail and beak trim when I paid $20 at my last place(in Encino).  I obviously had no idea it would be that much of a difference so I didn’t even think to ask before getting it done.  I don’t care if there’s a 10 -20$ difference but $100. That’s ridiculous.  Apparently that’s a normal price around here since I called another place and it was around the same price They did lower the price for me but it was still 80$. I’m still in shock. There’s no reason for it to be so much. I have a little green cheek conure. It took 15-20 min to do.  I’ll probably keep coming here for everyone but the bird. I’ll just take him with me when I go to LA for work I guess. No way I’m paying that price.  I really liked the doctor and staff so I couldn’t fault them too badly and just took away one star. I was just so disappointed. I’d love to be able to take all my animals to one place.<//text>< Pics>

My first time visit with Care Animal Hospital was great, my fur baby was injured and needed a vet now.  They worked us in and was seen within 10 minutes.   The front desk to the Doctor were so friendly and helpful.  This is my choice of Vets to go to from now on.  Wonderful place.<//review>

<Review>Sofie is a rescue kitty.  When I adopted her, she was brought to Care Animal Hospital from the shelter.  This was my first experience with this facility.  They were so kind to her and explained everything to me about her condition and care.  That was almost 4 years ago.  Their care and follow up have continued to be spot on.  Sofie just went in for her annual check up and to update her vaccinations.  The Dr. and the tech were very gentle with her and she actually settled down and was very cooperative during the whole ordeal.  The office staff and all the people working at Care Animal Hospital do their best to make any visit as comfortable as possible both for your pet and you.  I would highly recommend them.<//Review>< rate>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>I have always loved this vet, but when our dog was diagnosed with diabetes, I fell in love with everyone even more. Because of the diabetes and the frequent blood sugar checks, we are at the vet a couple of times a month. The staff is friendly, welcoming, and loves our little dog. They get to us promptly and follow up by phone quickly with the information we need regarding the insulin. And because we are there so often, I also see how wonderfully Kathy, at the front desk, and the techs treat everyone else who comes in. I have no idea how they compare price-wise with other vets in our area; however, I'll take love and good care over less expensive services any day.</Review>< Time>

Dr Alcorn is an AMAZING vet.

If you have a bird (even a small one) - CARE can provide amazing services - including intensive care.  Birds are extremely difficult to treat, and they are very delicate.

I was very pleased with the services and prices for such advanced care.  The whole staff took our small pet seriously and helped him improve to give him his best chance.< /Review>

<text>We had a wonderful experience taking our beloved dog to  Care Animal Hospital.  We just moved to Temecula and were worried about finding a new vet.  We are happier now than before with his old vet.  The staff was very helpful and pleasant.  Our vet, Dr Kelly Bowling DVM, was so patient with our dog Willie.  Willie is a rescue dog and was badly abused before we found him.  He has trust issues and Dr Bowling managed to examine him without making him feel terrified.  We appreciate Care Animal Hospital.  We will continue to take Willie here.  The office is clean and comfortable and the prices are fair.  We feel very lucky.</text>< rate>

I took my bearded dragon in there for a check up,  Perfectly fine that morning.  He was shedding and didnt eat for one whole day and that morning. So I  Decided too take him in. Within two hour that I got him back he turned all black and died. Still changed me the 120$ for killing my pet.<//Review>

Everyone is very friendly and helpful. They are affordable and don't sneak in extra fees and costs, and quote you the price before they perform any services so you're not surprised by the bill afterwards. They even call to make sure your pet is doing well in the days after. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

<review>Care takes walk ins and was able to fit us in when our personal vet could only give us an appt for four days later. The vet was wonderful with our dog! My dog showed no anxiety being there.

I when there for my son bearded dragon. The front office ladies had awesome customer service, no problem with them. Once the doctor came in the room and introduce himself, he checked out the reptile by holding him and with his thumb did a circular motion on his belly. Now he placed the reptile in his travel system and than his consultation was: he has a fracture neck, half paralyzed, low calcium, and he is in critical condition to the point that he might not make it. He said that they try all their best to save him if we leave him overnight and force feeding. The visit itself was 48 bucks, checking him in with all treatment 215.50 for a Juvenal bearded dragon. The doctor left the room to give me some time to think about it. The nurse comes in with this form of treatment plan and authorization for me to sign, when I said I had to think about it, she gave me a option b give the reptile an antibiotic mix with calcium, when I ask her what was the antibiotic for she said "to make him feel better" and I said okay but again what is it for? To treat him from what? Perasites? She said she doesn't know, basically she didn't know anything beside giving me documents for authorization on any treatment $$$$ that's what they care for. I took my pet to a different clinic and they said that my pet wasn't penalized, nor fracture on his neck. They said how they are going to conclude that without an X-ray. I doubt they wanted to help at least my pet. Not coming back.</review>

NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL! I have no idea how they have such a high review rating.
We went there for an ear infection. I’ve had a dog with an ear infection before (poodle and doodle breeds) so I know or have a good idea of the process, and this was a horrible experience for my dog.
1. They weren’t professional in handling her. She was mortified and then they blamed her for their lack of professionalism.
2. They Charged $200 for an EAR INFECTION!!! I know how much ear medication costs. So what happened is they charged us $100+ for them to apply it! Because an appointment is only $48.
3. They didn’t send us home with any medication. Every other vet I know sends you home with meds to take care of their ears. This vet said THEY would apply it to her ear, and then we could schedule ANOTHER appointment in a week to come back. AND DO THE SAME THING! WHAT?! You want us to pay $400 for an ear infection?! And also Shouldn’t the one time medication work? And if not then shouldn’t we be sent home with meds that we can apply? This is an under $100 thing for sure.
4. The vet then tried to convince us that she should be put under sedation so that he could clean her ears, spay her, and do several other expensive procedures THAT DAY!!! We just wanted her ear infection to be on the mend, and him trying to force us to do unnecessary procedures so he could have more money in his pocket was disgusting.
THIS IS SUCH UNIMPRESSIVE AND GREEDY PLACE! Not coming here again EVER!< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>We have been taking our french bulldog here since 2012 - Dr. Alcorn and the staff at Care have helped her enormously after she began having back and bladder issues several years ago.  We have seen 5 other veterinarians over the course of her life, but have definitely found a home at Care.  Thanks to their recommendations on exercise and diet (some of which I wish we had known years ago from our old vets before these issues even arose!), she has been doing MUCH better and I have a peace of mind knowing she's in great hands for her "sunset" years of life.  She loves Care and we've done everything from basic annual exams to dentistry, hospitalization, medication, and even boarding with them (which I never would have done before because I was too nervous).  She's done great and we are thankful for the great doctors and staff there.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

0 stars if I could went in for my bearded dragon because he wasn't regulating bowls normally they told me he was in critical condition and has a 30% chance of living even if we left them there for there 4 day care plan of force feedings even though he eats just fine. And were trying to get me to pay over 800 dollars for treatment like that and option be is to euthanize him.... They have no care about any reptile animals and no knowledge of anything about them. I highly recommend going somewhere else.<//Review>

I took one of my pets thier and my pet was badly ill she seemed like she was close to dieing, we wait a ling time and when they finally bought us into one of the rooms they took a long time. I noticed that my birds wasnt doing that well but they did not care until she seemed like she died i told the front lady and she finally took my bird to get checked up after she was already died these people really dont care she didnt even care to check my bird before even just a little checkup. Plz dont bring ur pet here

Thank u for explaining the situation to me, but they were well infromed that my pet wasn't doing well i told the lady in the front office all she said was "iam sorry their was alot of people ahead of you" and that was leting you guys be informed so yes they were well infromed< /Review>

They didn’t recommend a bunch of stuff we didn’t need but instead told us the first step to looking into some issues he was having. After receiving some really tough news they gently prepared us for the future and gave us a lot of time to process and a lot of tissues. The vet took a lot of time to answer questions. He also didn’t push anything on us and didn’t even offer any ridiculous procedures knowing the outcome was unlikely he would survive. I appreciate this office and Lisa made us feel very cared for. When we are ready for a new addition we will be coming back !

I am very pleased with the care that our bunny has been given by Dr Alcorn and his staff.  It is a relief to have a veterinarian that knows so much about rabbits!  Everyone in the office is very friendly and I appreciate the calls to check on our Dusty.<//Text>

<Review>We are so happy we found Care Animal Hospital.  We had 2 bad experiences with 2 other vets and Dr. Alcorn immediately identified our Chewys problem and began treatment.  He's doing so much better.  They truly care and called every day to check on him to see how he was doing. Everyone there is friendly and the office and exam rooms are clean and comfy.  Love them.  I tell everyone how great they are.<//Review>< pictures>

The people at the hospital are great and really care about your pet. I really like the way they follow up with you about their care and if they are doing Ok. I have recommended them to few friends that have pets.< /Review>

Everyone at Care Animal Hospital is extremely professional and knowledgeable.  Their caring attitude makes it easy to leave our boys in their care.  At first I thought their prices were rather high.  But I researched two other vets in Temecula and Murietta and they were all relatively comparable.  Our vets in San Diego were very cost effective, possibly due to their proximity to the base at Miramar.</Text>

I've been taking my critters to Care animal hospital for several years and several critters,some are in heaven some are still here,these people are the best.They always take that extra moment to explain what care is needed.And always understand when I can't afford a large bill,so they give the best care that I can afford.</text>

Dr. Alcorn has been treating our exotic pet for almost four years. We found him completely by chance while looking for someone who would treat exotics in the area. I couldnt be happier that we found him. Our pet was suddenly ill and losing hair and losing weight. Dr Alcorn was so kind and thorough and found that our little guy had adrenal disease and insulinoma. He took plenty of time explaining everything to us and helping us understand why our seemingly healthy pet was suddenly tanking and what could be done. The prognosis wasn't great but managable for a time. Under Dr. Alcorn's care our little guy has lived much longer than expected. Dr. Alcorn is always kind, patient with our questions, gives a thorough explanation of what is happening, and has a great bedside manner with our pet.
Don't let me forget the staff, who are wonderful! They always call to check on our little guy and see how he's doing. I have to call there regularly to get medication refills and they are always very pokite and helpful and get it taken care of quickly, and they never fail to ask how he is doing while they have me on the phone. I can't express enough how appreciative I am of the entire staff. I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a great vet!!!</review>

<text>They get 2 stars From me ONLY because Dr. V is amazing, however, they are WAY overpriced! I wanted to take my kitten there to get neutered as our other two cats go there for their primary care. After getting a price quote, they told me procedure was going to be over $900 because he was cryptorchid and had a tiny hernia. This did not include any other special requests such as a cone, aftercare medication or anything else. I took him to Banfield Pet Hospital on Ynez and they charged me $409 to do his surgery and that included the anesthesia, cone, IV catheter, microchip and they even gave him a mani/pedi while he was under. I do not understand how there can be a such a huge cost difference from one vet to the next and they’re not even a half mile apart! Banfield also set up a follow up appointment with my cat a week out to do a check up on him post surgery at no cost! I switched my pets care to Banfield permanently because I refuse to allow them to rob me blind!</text>< Pictures>

I would recommend Care Animal Hospital to anyone who loves their pets, no matter what type of pet they have.  Everyone there from the techs to the Drs are kind and professional to a T.  Walter and I are very happy to know them.  Thanks to Dr Alcorn and Lisa!< /review>

<text>I took my guinea pig Snickers to Care Animal Hospital because she had a bad uti. Dr. Joe Alcorn and his office staff were so nice to Snickers. Snickers got an x-ray and was placed on two medications. She also got her nails clipped too. They are the only vet that takes small animals. The office staff called me twice to make sure she was ok and how her 2 meds were doing. I highly recommend this veterinarian.<//text>< pics>

I brought in my leopard gecko as she wasn't eating enough for about a month (they can go several months with minimal food). I later learned that she was 70 grams, and that is a very good weight for  female leopard gecko.They took her out of her carry box, and started to roughly handle her. They Forced her on to her back, which is a position that can crush their diafragm and kill them. They pushed her stomach and made her poop. Then, they gave me a care plan for $224. They wanted to force feed, which is extremely dangerous, give her an injection with vitamins that she was already getting, do deworming (they hadn't done any tests to see if there were worms), and do a fecal test. That was ontop of the unavoidable $50 examination fee. They chargedme $50 to ask a few questions and potentially kill my gecko. Only reason they got 2 stars is because she brought up a couple things I could try to get her weight up.< /Text>

<UserId.>102266233895137695798<//UserId.><Review>Since moving to the Fallbrook area 5 years ago, we have struggled to find an animal hospital to help us maintain and care for our pets.  We have tried 2 in the immediate area with terrible results.  Recently, our otherwise healthy 3 year old cat could no longer jump.  After spending 2 nights in hospital with our previous vet with no diagnosis, pills for a tummy ache, a bill of $1000, and no sign of improvement, we tried Care Animal Hospital.  From the initial phone call through the examination, the staff and Dr. Alcorn were amazing.  Dr. Alcorn listened patiently to our description of the events and carefully explained possible causes, methodically ruling out the least likely.  His examination was gentle yet thorough and his diagnosis and therapy are working. Withing 24 hours, we've started to see improvement, no hospital stay required, and a bill of only $200.  Our cat is on the mend thanks to the wonderful staff here.  I couldn't be happier.  Thank you!<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< resp>

EXPENSIVE. They will not sell you Frontline with out an exam. Had to get a minor surgery for my dog and was quoted at $2100. Took him to 2 other places for other opinions and they were $650 and $800. Nice and upfront but, they think very highly of them selves.<//Review>

<review>Since 1999 when we move to Temecula, Care Animal Hospital and Dr. Alcorn have been amazing to all of our dogs throughout their lives. Many times we have needed his expert care and always, ALWAYS, we have received it. The front and back office staff are kind, courteous and helpful. Mostly the love they give our dogs is genuine.

I recommend Dr. Alcorn and staff to anyone who needs a veterinarian for their animal family members.</review>< pics>

<text>We brought our cat into the office to see Dr. Alcorn.  She had never been to the vet before.  We live in Moreno Valley so she wasn't to happy about the long time in the carrier.  When we got there the staff and Dr. were so calm and my cat just let them examine her and give her shots.  Also the treatment for my cat worked.  The Dr. was so happy about her recovery.  You could see it in his face.  I have been to a lot of Vet's in my life, but I have to say this hospital is the best.  One of our rabbits got really sick and we brought him in on a Saturday.  The Dr. said the rabbit needed more help than they had available so she sent us down to La Jolla for treatment.  Best advice.  Our rabbit recovered.  I recommend Care Animal Hospital to anyone with any kind of pet.

<Date>1461643835788<//Date><rate>1< /rate><review>EXPENSIVE!!! My senior dog suffered a seizure and had to be euthanized. This is the vet office I took her too and the doctors lack of compassion is ridiculous. $98 just for them to see her because we didn't have an appointment AND they will charge you extra if you want to be with your fur baby during the euthanasia. I've worked as a veterinarian assistant in different offices and have never seen a veterinarian lack the compassion for a person so much so that they would charge them to be there for the process during a difficult time. Plus, while some veterinarians might charge a $10-$15 additional exam fee for walk in patients I have never seen one charge an emergency exam fee during business hours! Not only did I lose one of my best friends of 14 years today but it cost me $268 PLUS I did not have the additional amount to be there for the euthanasia. I'm still in tears and can't believe how this office runs its policies in these situations! The staff was fine but any veterinarian who sets their business up this way lacks all compassion and empathy. I will never be able to change the fact that because this was the closest vet office in my situation that I lost my fur baby in such a heartbreaking way...</review>< Gmap_id>

My cat was literally dying or close to it. He was seen immediately by Dr.Craft and felt at ease from the begining of the exam. I was given a list of suggested treatment avenues and was able to decline the options I felt unable to go through with at that time. No pressure to do anything I felt wasnt needed. Within less than 12 hours he was back to his normal, perky, heathy self and we were thankful to Dr.Craft and her awesome staff for all the kindness.<//review>

My baby bunny got Pasturella and they gave me a next day appointment which was great and when i got there everyone was kind and seemed to really care about my bunny Dusty, the visit and medication was really inexpensive and they didnt do anything unnecessary to jack up the cost. The only thing is the "nurse" didnt really know how to hold a rabbit and didnt know much about rabbits which made me kind of nervous to have her handling him, but Dr. Kelly was rad, she put my mind at ease about the whole thing and assured me he'd get better in about 2 weeks. Overall a great experience, I'd recommend this place to anyone with a pet!<//Text>

Our elderly dog is under their care as well as our bird. The staff is warm, understanding, and always upfront regarding treatment plans. This is the first pet hospital we have experienced that calls personally to follow up on the pet's wellbeing, to answer questions, and to ensure the pet's health is looked after.
I would recommend Care Animal Hospital to anyone who has a furkid needing medical attention.

We had our annual check up today for our bird Frankie. Dr. Alcorn was very gentle and thorough with the exam. Frankie got the spa treatment and came away with a great bill of health! Thanks Dr. Alcorn and your wonderful staff!<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>We lost our boxer 3 weeks ago to GDV and brought in our new boxer baby in for his 1st check-up. As you can imagine we were overprotective parents asking a lot of questions.

Dr. Alcon and his staff took their time to educate us on boxer health and homemade dog food nutrition.

He helped put our concerns at ease and are looking forward to him being our Bodhi's Doctor.

If you're looking for a vet that cares about your fur baby's wellbeing and is willing to treat your pet based on your family's needs - we highly recommend CARE Animal Hospital.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Hidden gem! So happy that I found this place. We have a new fur baby & made an appt for a new puppy exam. 1st I'd like to say that I contacted them via fb & they were prompt to reply as well as very helpful & friendly!:) Customer service is very important!!!
Kathi who manages the front desk was very helpful as well. Andrea was our tech and let me tell you...what a ray of sunshine! Super sweet & wonderful energy. She was very helpful & accommodating. We met with Dr.Alcorn. I have been to many vets over the years & I have to say that this was the BEST Vet exam that we've ever experienced. Professional, knowledgeable & helpful. The office is clean & the services are affordable. The whole experince was defianlty an A+ experience! We will continue to bring our pets to this animal clinic as well as highly recommend to friends /family. A big thanks to Kathi,Andrea,Dr.Alcorn & my FB friend! ;0)<//Review>

<review>This is a very important place, for those who need either a shelter/homeless services, community to prevent alienation, or people who have taken on hard times and have never been anywhere close to homeless, this site is not like some welfare office but a place where staff cares about the people who go there. They also act as a access point for people to get placed into housing, and they are one of the few places undocumented immigrants and  everyone else can go and get basic human treatment.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< Review>
Let’s be honest here, seriously.  Maybe the concept is good in intent but it certainly does not transcend in practice as it relates to purpose.  The organization receives city and county funding.  The source for those funds come from ALL taxpayers and not just those who this center tends to “favor” in providing services.  They do not serve just the Hispanics or Filipino population but a large number of Blacks utilize this facility as well; and it’s this particular group of individuals that this center elects - openly - to overlook.  Limited programming (unlike that given to either LGBTQ or women).  A lack of Black staff.  But a disproportionate number of DOS in correlation to others I’ve personally speak up to have the voice heard as it relates to services.  However, there is certainly no shortage of staff demanding “eqality” for all while mindfully stepping on a specific group of people that frequent the center on any given day!

I’d like to see this center stop with the racism and racial politics and treat EVERYONE fairly!  Hire Black staff - certainly there are. Few qualified individuals in the city!  Stop catering to specific groups if you are not going to cater likewise to EVERYONE!  Get rid of the double-standards.

I disagree with others that want us to believe that staff at MNRC “walk on water” ....... just the opposite.  They put their pants on the way all of us do - one leg at a time!  One star because I couldn’t rate you any lower.</Review>

If you are homeless, this is one of the two places to visit ASAP, the other is 1235 Mission Street where the office for San Francisco's Human Services is located.

Most people direct the homeless to the MSC or Multi Services Center, which happens to have all the desirable services. Except the Security Guards treat everyone that comes in as if they were a dangerous guilty convicted felon, no exceptions. Partly because of their paranoid attitude and poor understanding of other cultures (racism biases, stereotypes,  and limited english) Unless you were a known celebrity or city official, then they either behave or hide out of sight.
At the MNRC or Mission Neighborhood Resource Center, they treat everyone with genuine honesty, dignity and human courtesy. Not like a convict.
There is also a clinic on site Mon thru Fri, for medical service and referrals for specialist needs. Unlike MSC there is a patio on the 2nd floor for smokers.
Unfortunately the facility is limited due to its small building. If they had more donors and donations they could offer more services and help people better.

Right now it is limited to a maximum of 75 persons at any given time, during normal business hours.

To be processed in order to participate and get on the waiting lists for shelters, and single night emergency shelter.
You will have to come by early in the morning, once you've been processed into the DHSA's computer system. M - F to get signed into the days eligibility list for one night emergency shelter stays. Before normal opening hours, usually around 5 am, for the shower list, shelter list, and the laundry waiting list for the day.
Sometimes the line starts sooner, like 4 or 3 am, from time to time.
On cold wet rainy days, the line is usually smaller and later. Bring an umbrella, there is no awnings for 99.2% of the buildings in this city.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We were on a motorcycle ride and were lucky to stop at Queenie’s for breakfast! First off, the coffee was awesome. The atmosphere and service was storybook, just what you dream of when out on the coast. The food is prepared with local ingredients and you can smell and taste the freshness immediately. I had the Gertrude Omelette, and the bacon....oh the bacon! Will be back with my wife!
Thank you Queenie’s!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>A great place with great atmosphere and great food. Nice people. Everything on the menu is fantastic with meticulous attention to detail  (not art on your plate, just delicious thoughtfully prepared food). Hard to choose just one item for your meal - pick several and share. Prices seem to be right in line with any other place in the area. Plan on spending at least an hour here for a meal - good food takes time.  A great destination anytime I am in the area, and a great excuse to go when I am not. Located in one of the most beautiful places on the Pacific Coast.<//Review>< pictures>

We came to this place for dinner. This place was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, we were not disappointed. The crew were very polite and we felt very good. The meal was great. We enjoyed every moment and we will visit this place again. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Nice quaint restaurant but we waited over an hour for our food meanwhile watching other people order their food, get it, eat, and leave. When we asked what was taking so long their response was the kitchen was just taking longer than normal.  I said that we watched other people that arrived after us get their food already so I knew it wasn't a kitchen issue and they said those guests pre-ordered, even though we were standing there waiting and watched them with a menu and ordered. They couldn't just admit they didn't put our order into the kitchen (from what we could tell), an honest mistake, but had to make up other excuses and be argumentative. Not sure how they missed our order though as we were standing there the whole time while they were walking past us serving people outside.  This place is not cheap either, offered no discount for their mistake. Would not recommend.<//Text>

<Review>Queenie’s has been a favorite spot for years, not just due to its location – along what might be the most beautiful stretch of coast in California – but because the food is amazing. I bring people here whenever I get the chance. Also, the stuffed potato omelet, with balsamic onions and roasted garlic, is outstanding.< /Review>< pics>

Enjoyed the Veggie Mash, per the waitress’ suggestion, and was delighted to find whole garlic cloves mixed in (!).

The coffee was **astonishingly** good - Big River Co. coffee, ground freshly in front of me before brewing (beans sold on the premises).

That day the menu board featured locally caught ling cod - a special treat! One more reason to go out of your way to eat here.</text>

< Review>
Honest hometown good food. Got an omelet and a waffle, and the veggies in the omelet were fresh and delicious, none of that bland discount stuff served elsewhere. Ho early, it looked like something mom would've made at home. My only complaint was the wait; they were busy, yes, I'll give them that. When we ordered, we were told "at least 20 minutes", which it was...ended up over an hour. The food really was delicious, just....room to work on the estimates, and giving a better estimate of the wait.< /Review>

They offer the dish in two ways one served on potatoes and the other way served on an herbed biscuit. I tried the biscuit and it was amazing. I would definitely recommend this for meals.

There are many millions of cafes, restaurants, diners in the world, and almost as many cheeseburgers. But there is only one Queenies' Cheeseburger.
By far, the absolute best, most delicious, juicy cheeseburger on the entire planet.

There are some other fantastic offerings at Queenie's, including the amazing breakfast plates, but her Cheeseburgers are an artistic triumph.

Not enough superlatives to adequately describe, so you need to just go and have one.<//text>

<text>I had the buttermilk pancakes and they were fantastic. Service and food was way beyond my expectations.  If I lived locally I would make it a regular stop. Only reason it wasn't a five star review is because of my unfamiliarity with the entire menu. I highly recommend stopping and having a meal here. You will be impressed with the food.<//text><user_id>118334744951571308632</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>What a great little place to stop for breakfast. I had the salmon omelet, which was perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious. The coffee was strong and bottomless and the service was warm and friendly. Well worth the stop in charming Elk.</review>< Name>

< Review>
We were taking the long scenic route home and found this cafe right before we starved to death! :/
Much to my disappointment this place is overpriced,  small portions and no french fries and gravy! Had a hamburger that came with a few sprigs from the garden and left, not starving, but not fulfilled. This would be a great place for a health conscious person on a diet, but not the place for me.</Review>

For those who reviewed the prices were high, I say - that is what real quality ingredients that are well prepared cost!

The wait was over an hour after we ordered! We had to go to the counter to get coffee refills. Toilet was out of order. Wait staff told me to go to the outhouse. It was locked, they never offered the key. I walked across the way to use the outhouse in the park. Food was ok, but the staff wasn't as welcoming as what I'm used to. I've waited on tables too.< /review>

I eat at Queenies regularly. Check out the special board and see what is being offered. This is slow food, everything is cooked to order. Have some excellent coffee and talk to the people around you.</Text>

Food was ok, but way overpriced. My burger was pretty good but about $4 more than it should have been. My wife's chicken sandwich (panini) was dry/overcooked.

It also took forever. We stopped for lunch while traveling. It took well over an hour from the time we sat down to paying....way too long for the type of meal.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) If you come here on Highway 1, you should definitely stop by this small restaurant! :) We had very good breakfast here and despite a large wedding party that filled almost the entire restaurant, we were served very friendly and quickly. ♥

<review>last night was our first time we went to this place. But It is surely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the courteous service, with the high quality  cuisine and booze and with the friendly price. We will no doubt go back there soon.< /review>< Pictures>

<username>Jami Whitmire<//username><Time>1606839236783<//Time><rating>5</rating><text>One of the best poke places in my area! Portions are huge and tastes fresh.
Fish and topping choices are similar to most other poke shops, but I like how this place lets you mix and match different types of sauces!
The first scoop of massage, crab meat, and avocado are free which is always a plus :)
My friend and I placed an order online for pick up and was ready when we got there.
All staff were wearing masks with glass screen near the register, +1 for taking Covid precautions!
I got the small with albacore and tuna, soy+sriracha combo, half brown rice/greens, and most of the toppings ($10.70), although a little pricy for a choice of 2 proteins, they give you a lot in portion.
The seafood tasted fresh with an generous amount of toppings.
It was a little hard to mix due to the copious amount of toppings but other than that amazing!
Personally, I like this place better than Poke Wave for the portion size.
Highly recommend this location for a poke kinda day.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCTvfbD-zJtgmdffrAarkFGmDNTtYrlJA-4f8b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlAZOU_9sau2HuXSvlnNFiFxZoCYY6eL9WGrLT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ2hwLSYzQbPREju5GuZIi7JOrYdDRGioxLQ4B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGbZ09jvPBEhkjdp1T3RM-WnOtmiivOF0Fimcm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7M4nJ4gjCfPj-v0Z_CuM3H-fL8xI8aXYlVe3P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6uoeueH-Vd18rM7kfJXFaTUbcha8Z9nXIS371=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcgkxybbQCQkKhlH41-B4h2-5nP8YZhw_Wbk_M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7c9YcdhVysX2AbrPrLjbYeXwxkBfJWCoroxGE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqNGjzcDfGUPzpYJB6-2JYD3hPmX7VArSjkL6u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2P6eAVvK8CaetS1cRyUYSw4Iev4xsMPnu04b3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVIaNwh7VrnDVbrJ5CIfJ1qTs2O9HkdbACvVda=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxDrk0nxdsT8FbrLOdhwn9m-pov46BmoBwsU31=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM-B3uEpviHe9NMWGO9fM-Yrrcf8U7yKjr2arq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMYfLgeR8CZX8YNM_OgREVrLl8p_FIpT6kx3u9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNza95zKcQ1Lee0ZUaiRQ26N8CqOBfJ0xrtFag_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Response>None</Response><review>I bought a bowl from poke today and not only did they upcharge on prices, but they gave less rice and sauce. But the thing that ultimately upset me was the fact that I found a piece of plastic hidden under a cucumber in my bowl!! If I can post a picture I will.

Honestly unsure why this place receives such high reviews. As a poke junkie, this place to me was very basic.

Wasn't impressed with the crab salad, and the rice was cold. They don't mix in the traditional mix ins with the sauce, and the mix in options were thin.

Overall the options were decent, prices were fair, but definitely wasn't the best or worst poke place I've been to. The guy who served me got my order wrong twice (probably because of speaking through plexi glass and a mask)

Nice location that offers outdoor seating, stopped here while shopping.</review>

I starting eating Poke after we came back from Kauai. That was the first time Zi had tried Poke. All the grocery stores have 5 to 10 different kinds of poke. The bowls at PokeBlwlz were really good. The fish was very fresh tasting and the sauce was fantastic. I really enjoyed the poke bowl. The staff was friendly and helpful. Their prices are very fair. You get what you pay for. Good food good customer service. Highly recommend</Text>

Good local option for Poke. Fish was good and toppings were plentiful.  I would only ask that they spend a bit more time on fish prep to make sure that unnecessary fat and the occasional cartilage is removed. Had a few pieces of the tuna that had to be skipped. Otherwise, I was satisfied.</Text>

One of the best poke spots I've been to! I live in la, but had some business in oc & ended up finding this spot! Lots of parking, no need to worry about that.

What I like about this place is their service and the food quality. The employees were really helpful in reviewing the food & they make it right in front of you! I got the small salad (which lets you choose two fish). I got the salmon and tuna. They have a variety of sauces .. I got the spicy one.

I really enjoyed their ceviche too. It comes with wonton chips , which I believe they make there. ITS SO BOMB, no joke!!

You won't regret trying this spot!< /Review>

Best poke bowls in California by far. I’ve tried many poke bowls in Hawaii too and this is definitely authentic, I honestly think that it’s better than those in Hawaii! Well worth the money for the portions! Will definitely be back for more</Review>

The food here is always fresh and they do a discount for applied medical members. I usually just do a regular bowl with half rice and half salad and three choices of protein.

The owners are very pleasant and so are the workers. there was one only one bad experience from when one of the workers decided to serve his friend first instead of me but no matter.</Review>

<Review>Great food at not too bad of a price given the area. A little expensive for me but absolutely delicious. Lots of choices!
Heads up this is cold poke for those who may not know. So just like sushi but in a bowl.< /Review><Time>1526700208383< /Time>< rating>

<Review>The food is good and you get a lot for your money.  My problem is with the help. Today I had to wait for an extended amount of time while the only two female employees flirted with a customer at the cash register. Also, on two prior occasions my order had to be remade due to the wrong items being placed in my bowl.

Miss Lauren Was Definitely An energizing charge to my day And has definitely made me a Vanna White to this company. She is definitely A blessing to the company and an asset to its staff..  And definitely a new addition to my life as I say farewell to the DMV headaches and as I say  hello to the modern version of it, The Tag Stop...< /Text>

< Review>
The lady who works there is friendly and knowledgeable, but the place is small and not well kept. There was a ceiling fan with dust from around the Clinton administration. Hardly anyplace to sit if there's a line. If you think your registration fee is excessive, you don't want to use a place like this. They charge their own service fee plus a fee for using a credit card. No checks. Cash is good IF you have enough on you to cover the extra fees!<//Review>

It was my first time here. Lauran assisted me on getting my tags renewed. She was very nice and friendly. The process was fast. I definitely recommend this place, i would’ve been waiting for hours at the DMV. I’m so glad I found this place!</Review>

Easiest way to get you car registration/ title transfer/ off road tags. Yes you have to pay a small fee but it's a lot quicker then waiting at the DMV for hours or making an appt for waiting 3 weeks. You can pay and get you tags/sticker on the spot!< /Review>

<review>I went in a day ago and i had just got off work. It was such a hard day and i was not in the best mood. Going to the tag shop was the last place i wanted to be but after going it turned my whole day around. Stephanie Arce made my day so much better and she helped me with my transfer/tags. She knows exactly whats shes doing. They should hire more people like her. This tag shop will most definitely be the place im going to for any motor vehicles I have. Thank you!!< /review>< gmap_id>

< review>
Went to Tag Stop El Cajon to get my 63’ Cadillac Registered and Title transferred to my name and I must say Jaimie did what no other spot could do and what the DMV wouldn’t do. The car had Several years of back registration. I thought I was going to come out of pocket with an arm and a leg. She made the experience pleasant, and painless! I will go there from now on to register and title all my vehicles from now on, and I recommend you do the same. All praise is do... 👌🏽< /review>

We came in April and paid all the fees.   We were told we had to get a smog.  We went straight to get the smog and came straight back.  We were told we had to wait on the plates to come in and were given a temp tag.  Some time later my wife gets a call saying our plates were in.  I went down and was told we owe $15 so I said I'll pay it and she said no that she would lose the receipt.  So I didnt get the plates.  From that point our car had gone to the shop and was there for 2 months.  We didnt hear back from the tag stop so we went there and was told that they were waiting on the smog.  What?  Now I'm going to the DMV to figure this out.  This has been the worst experience ever.  I don't reccomend going here.

Don't know how they have 4.9 and all these good reviews.  Then my experience should  have been good as well.<//text>

Recently my company purchased a vehicle from out of state. It required to pay tax and licensing along with the registration here in California. I didn’t really know where to start so I contacted the tag shop in El Cajon and Jaime walked me through the process step-by-step she was polite courteous and very professional. She turned it around quickly and we were able to get the vehicle on the road almost immediately. I highly recommend the tag stop!  Jamie was amazing and really knew her stuff!< /text>

Recently moved back to San Diego and purchased a fifth wheel which was titled from another state. Jamie Was extremely helpful with all of the transactions needed, she prepared all the paperwork while waiting for me to go pick up  the owner of the fifth wheel to sign the documentation.

I have used a tag shop on 2 other occasions both of which were painless and a pleasure to deal with.
Thank you Jamie
I would and will highly recommend The Tag Stop< /Text>

First time here for me as I am a small business owner and time is valuable to me. They took very good care of me quickly and efficiently. I was there no more than 20 minutes. They got me registered even with the  problems I had. I highly recommend the Tag Stop.<//Text>

I got screwed with buying a used car. They worked with over the course of a couple days to help me get my car legal and ready to drive. They went above and beyond what was needed for to get what I needed to do, done. Definantly a great place to go to for DMV issues without having the issues of dealing with the actual DMV. Staff was really nice and cool too.</text>

Long story short...I had a project truck I had been working on for a few years. Had been going to the DMV and paying the registration every year. Some how it wasn’t getting paid unknown to me. I went to the tag stop to skip lines the girl there told me I had over paid and I was good. So when I went to pay my registration for 2019 I was shocked when Jaime told me I owed $440 some odd amount. Luckily I had brought all my receipts. She was also confused looking at them. She took copies of my receipts and went to the DMV multiple times. Anyway she got my tags after working very hard to save me money. I owed nothing by the time she was done!!! In fact I got a $2 refund. I highly highly recommend this place and will be a life long customer. Thank you Jaime!<//text>

< Review>
I had moved and so my tags weren’t sent to me. Also, in the move, I lost the title to my car. I was visiting in El Cajon and a friend suggested that I go to Tag Stop. I had no idea that a place like this existed. Meagan was so helpful and it turned out that the DMV had no record of my getting tags for the last three years. It was a nightmare. Jamie and Meagan worked together on the mess my records were in. They finally got it all fixed after working on it for over a week and I am now updated and have my currant tags! These two young woman were amazing and I am so thankful. If I had gone to the DMV, I would still be standing in line. I just wish there was a TAG STOP in Idaho. These two young women were phenomenal and  treated me as if I was their only client. Five stars is not enough.<//Review>

<text>I walked in and I was greeted by two beautiful ladies. The one whom assisted me was named Samantha. I sat down at her desk and I said I was there to renew and reinstate my vehicle registration. We got straight to it. I loved how it was a straight forward process. We just input all my vehicle info, called the DMV to verify a few things, paid my registration, and got my tags. It was super hassle free. It took less than 10 minutes to get done. Why spend 2-3 hours at DMV when you can come to an alternative place and get it done faster? If I can give 6 stars, I would. Another shout out to Samantha for helping me.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would.

I came into this location for a transfer and renewal. I have used them before and THOUGHT they were more than helpful and professional. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances with the vehicle I purchased, smog took longer to be turned in to complete my application. During that time, the title to my vehicle was lost by this establishment. Instead of attempting to rectify the situation, they deflected blame and attempted to charge me $75 to do a "reconstruction". I called the DMV and will be getting everything handled for $21. I paid them to do a service. The service was not rendered. I will definitely be elevating this as high as I possibly can because this is WRONG.</text>

{'time': 1540011646455, 'text': 'Thankyou for taking the time to leave feedback for the Tag Stop. The Tag Stop does not keep titles in till the transaction is complete! Since you needed a smog to finish your transaction, your title was sent with you when we gave you a permit. WE HAVE SERVED OVER 200,000 CUSTOMERS AND NEVER LOST A SINGLE DOCUMENT! We even provided you with backup documents because your car was broken into! YOU TOLD US YOUR TITLE WAS STOLEN AT THAT POINT! We tried to call you back to help you and you told us we had the wrong number! We are not perfect but we strive to help everyone, 24 hours a day! We appreciate you as a customer but we can not do things for free or we would not be in business! Our fee is $75.00 to reconstruct lost or stolen documents. Yes, you can go to DMV AND DO IT FOR $21.00! We even offered to do it for $45.00! Good luck in your future endeavors!.\n\nThanks\nThe Tag Stop'}<//resp>

<review>I called and spoke to Brittany.  My vehicle passed smog, but the results did not show up on the DMV website, when I went to register my vehicle online.
She was familiar with this glitch, and would be able to take care of it for a
very reasonable rate.  Before I drove to her business with my paperwork,
I tried online one more time.  This time it went through, so I did not need her services.  She was very nice, and I called her back to let her know, which she also appreciated.  I would not hesitate to use her service, if the need arises.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>We came here beginning of September because we were too busy to get our title at the DMV. There computer system crash on the middle of us. They still charged us not the Convenience fee after three hours of waiting. We understand things happen. October comes I know the DMV is slow, but not that slow calls them. They say they will get it replace. November now we have not receive it so we told them to check the address and they say it is right. End of November now we come in instead of calling them again they look at the address and realize they got the apartment number wrong.

Go to the DMV at least the reiterate what you say even though it is in slow motion at least they can do their job.

Not one star because they have okay customer service.

Below, Madie also receive the same problem as me with the title service if they give me a refund I will be surprised too, but I highly doubt it.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

This place is great! I highly recommend The Tag Stop in El Cajon. Brittany was really friendly and goes the extra mile so you leave with your tags and a smile.< /Review>

<review>Spent over an hour at AAA for a simple title transfer. When it was finally our turn the woman said the DMV wouldn't take the title because the odometer reading looked scribbled. It wasn't even remotely scribbled. Went to The Tag Shop and in 10 minutes I was on my way and the transfer was complete. Highly recommended this place. I even asked her if the title was going to be a problem because AAA had said it would and she said it was no problem. She let me know that plenty of people come in here because AAA doesn't like to do their job.< /review><pics>None<//pics><userid>105703270809527635918<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They completed the service for a title transfer. However, the DMV did not send the title to the correct address because the tag stop failed to use the correct address on my documents after telling them clearly and multiple times. I expected more care would be taken with such a secure document. In addition, I had to argue with the staff to get my refund sent to my address and instead the staff wanted me to pick it up after already visiting this company twice to get this simple title transfer done. The manager was rude and was not willing to help. Honestly, I will be surprised if they actually give me my refund. I am currently reporting their refund policies to the Federal Trade Commission. I would not and will not use this company ever again for title transfer until the costumer service is changed.< /Review>< pictures>

Couldn't schedule an appointment at SD DMV's anywhere due to the system being down and the average wait was around 2-3 hours. So I went here to renew my commercial stake bed, easy process. In and out in 5-10 mins with registration and the tags I needed.<//Text>

<Review>I needed my DMV registration at 9:00pm, I called the Tag Shop and they opened up and got my dmv registration  for my vehicle. I got my vehicle impounded after deployment.

Always a positive experience and being military it helps that they can do the non resident military paper work while they smog shops can’t</text>

My tags expired a long time ago. I was embarrassed to go to the El Cajon DMV so I decided to check this place out. The lady at the tag stop was very helpful and didn't make me feel uncomfortable at all. The price was cheap and I was out the door in like 10 minutes. The El Cajon dmv would have taken hours. Thank god for this El Cajon dmv service, the tag stop. They have emergency dmv services as well if your car is impounded!< /text>

I've been buying their pizza for the past 10 years,it's always good. However customer service has declined a lot. It used to be friendly and inviting and now they always sound like you owe them. If you want good pizza you won't be disappointed but customer service is 1 star.</Review>

It was indeed Amazing and can't beat the prices! My family found our new local pizzeria!
We got the 2 med. Deal with cheesecake & garlic cheese bread. Everything was Awesome!
Kind of random choice for a pizza joint to have cheesecake as a side....but, Daaaamn!!!the best cheesecake we've ever had!<//Text>< pics>

The jalapeños in the jalapeño poppers were almost too tough to chew, the boneless wings had almost no bbq sauce on them. The delivery driver was Not wearing a fu*king mask, either!! Thankfully I Was. That shows that the employees are Not taking necessary precautions.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

They’re always great and bring a smile to my sisters and brothers faces when I place one of their pizzas on our table, their pizza is our favorite and good food is always nice especially during hard times. They’re always super chill and Their delivery service is awesome. You’re doing great 👍< /review>

<Review>Overall satisfied with experience, price, and taste. Mushrooms are sliced paper thin and the crust is quite thin too, but the taste is delicious and not too oily. Their Large & Xtra Large are the same price, so thats cool.

Is not the worse nor the best pizza.

Had a Med. Pizza w/ pepperoni and jalopenios, thin crust. Lacks crispiness on the pepperoni and the bread was soggy. Still ate it but probably will not be eating here again.</review>

<Review>We order pizza from Superb Pizza on 5601 Watt Ave. North Highlands Ca 95660 at least twice some times more a month. We always tell them NO MUSHROOMS on any of the pizzas we order, we even tell them someone in the house is allergic to mushrooms. 3 times in the last 2 months one of our pizzas has mushrooms. When you say no mushrooms everytime you order from them, you assume there won't be any mushrooms. The people at this location needs to understand their customers when they say no this and no that. Because now my daughter in law is now puking her guts out, shaking, sweating and extremely sick because this location doesn't understand when we say NO MUSHROOMS!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Can't say enough good things about this place and their pizza! If you haven't tried their white sauce, do it. The food is always amazing, they have great deals, and the employees are friendly. We love pizza do we're picky and this is soooooo yummy< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I ordered two gyros and two potato wedges today. Superb has a deal where you can  mix two items From their menu for $12.99 so basically I had two orders at $12.99 each. My daughter came back to my car and said it would be a 20 minute wait so we decided to go up the street for a quick eyebrow wax. When she got out the car she asked for additional money and I said where’s the money back from Superb pizza as I gave her a $20 a $5 and $3. She said the owner was on the phone and didn’t give her anything back. So I called him and asked how much was everything and he said $25. I said well my daughter which is 16 gave you $28. He said I thought it was a tip. I said a tip for what? Taking her order? He said well I was on the phone I’ll give you back $2 but not $3. At this point that made me a little upset but I didn’t let him know because I knew I’d be leaving a review. I politely told him to keep the “tip”. When I arrived to pick up my order my daughter and I both went in. He gave me the bag of food with $2 in the bag on top of my food. That grossed me out even more. So in my honest opinion I have been going to superb for a good amount of time,  moved away and still came back to patronize and for the owner to be on the phone taking money and orders is rude and not good customer service. Not provide a receipt is something the state should be looking into and put nasty money on my food is definitely something the health department should look into. He has lost me as a customer. Because for one I know how much I gave her and the fact I went the extra mile to drive to him and be short changed out of my own money baffles me. You want a tip? Here’s a tip you don’t take tips, tips are offered to you. Learn better customer service and you would know that basically $1that you stole from me cost you to lose a good customer and to receive this review. In fairness the food is decent in taste .. area sketchy.. place outdated and dirty and obviously he’s let this business stress him out where he is strapped for cash to rob me and in reality my 16 year old child of $1. Way to go superb you’ve earned your tip!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x809ad8eeb7c6685b:0x66c9dbda71e1b616</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I usually walk in and it takes no longer than the time to  take the fresh dough, roll and bake the pizza to be on my way.  If you want it faster, call in your order.  It's a one man show with a helper and the place is always busy with either call-ins for take out or deliveries or pick-ups for their pizza.  The pizza is better than the usual run of the mill and is made fresh.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>My girlfriend and I order from them every week and love it.  We always get extra cheese.  It's a real bargain at this place, where we can get three decent sized medium pizza's with extra cheese, and garlic bread, and it comes with a few free cans of soda automatically, all coming in for around $30 lasting us days.  I recommend a jalapeno and mushroom, as it has a nice burn without being overpowering.  The main guy there works hard, and well-- especially alone.  The gyro's are also a decent size and price, with good flavor and also comes with a can of soda.

Probably our biggest gripes is the limited delivery range (I've heard him mention it helps keep prices down-- can't complain about that), and the deliver drivers do tend to park in two spots... maybe to keep a wide door swing for loading?

In any case, we're wild about it and I recommend it regularly.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809ad8eeb7c6685b:0x66c9dbda71e1b616</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Furthermore, when I called to get a replacement they would not give one saying " it's Thanksgiving" .  So really what the guy meant was what do you expect, it's Thanksgiving take it or leave it. Superb pizza, you lost my business, and I will tell ALL my friends about this and they will tell two friends and so forth, and so forth!
In addition, I called back to inform the order taker that I will be reversing my charge and his reply was " F***k you, f***k off. Now that's good business, right?  I let him know I was doing this because they are unwilling to replace the pizza.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Order from this place once per month, can't beat the price when compared to standard chains like Round Table and Mountain Mikes...delivery times are fast! This location could work on its phone/customer service though...drivers have been very nice though.<//review>

I called to clarify the cheesecake to fund out that it is a SINGLE SLICE OF CHEESECAKE. Who orders 2 pizzas and 16 bread sticks and only ONE slice of cheesecake? "OK timmy, here is your bite, here little sally, here's yours, one for hubby and one for me". This is the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen. Don't offer this as a deal, I can see offering 4 slices and making the price a little higher, but don't make it sound like this is a wonderful deal. Stupid. Utterly stupid.< /review>< rating>

<username>Joselyn Ramirez< /username><Review>I don't know what happened. I used to love this place and they used to be so friendly, but now they are very rude and unprofessional.

They decided that they will no longer deliver to your apartment even though they always used to. When I asked about it, I was told it was because of the locked gate. After I told them the gate was open, they agreed to still deliver, but upon arrival the delivery person called me and told me I have to come out to the gate and they will not come to your door. I explained to him that I was just told my pizza would be delivered to my door. But he would not budge, and said that is how it's always been. That's not true, they always used to deliver to your door, but I guess this is a new policy or new delivery person.

That wasn't such a huge deal, although I don't see the logic in having to pay full delivery price when you are not getting the full delivery service, but okay. What I can't forgive is the awful service and attitude you receive just when you are placing an order! First I was put on hold, then rushed for my order, then put on hold again. After the order was finished and the man quickly hung up, I had to call back because he neglected to take my credit card information. Guess what he said? "I'll have to call you back".

Confused, I just said "Okay" and he hung up. That was 30 minutes ago. I definitely understand how it is to get really busy, but if you could have heard his attitude and tone in his voice you would understand how I'm feeling right now. I don't know what happened to the nice old man I used to always see there, but they must have changed staff recently.

Oh, and the pizza is good, not the best but not bad either. It's just the service that sucks.<//Review>< Time>

Absolutely the worst this place is lead by the worst management ever. Take it from me. Who currently lives in a local hotel, single mother of almost two babies. (8.5 months pregnant) who is currently transitioning with an extreme amount of things on my plate. Over stressed and under appreciated. Anyways yes the manager/owner of this restaurant is incapable of accepting responsibility for any of his mistakes and the customer is never right. Infact you will never even get the chance. Even when you are willing to take less of a corrected order I paid for a while$37.00 total. Including to because on like this Kevin manager/owner. The delivery service and food presentation as well as neatness and offensiveness the temperature and over all like was very nice. Anyways the order was made with multiple mistakes more miss understandings. But I couldn't even get Kevin to at least honor me solely the entires where misunderstanding was made. And he didn't have to bring us the 16pc cheese. Garlic sticks nor the 2lt of cherry Pepsi we ordered but received Serria mist. I really enjoyed this restaurant however I would never recommend this pizza place nor will I ever return. Dealing with someone with such negative energy and attitude who refusing to even work with polite compromising customers that are always guaranteed money income for your business. Well that's just hard headed.<//Text>

<Review>Tried ordering pizza in person but couldn't. Man behind counter was way to busy to even look at me and acknowledge the fact that I was in there. The other man in the back actually making a pizza just looked up, saw me and went back to making the pizza. After standing there and being ignored I decided to leave, to which he still didnt bother looking at me. Im from out of town but even if I was local I would never bother going in again.< /Review>< Pictures>

Some people have said its hard to get service, which I would concur, BUT its because there is one guy mayyyybe 2 working in this small place.

I ordered food online for delivery, order went through at 6:37 pm and it said my order would arrive in 30-60 minutes. So i waited, and it had been over an hour, so i called. They put me on hold for 5 minutes and when they finally came back i asked how come i hadnt received my order, and he asked whats your address and when i told him he said "oh yeah, that one. It wil be there in ten minutes." Its now 8:15 pm and my food STILL HASNT ARRIVED. MY KIDS ARE HUNGRY. IM SO DISAPPOINTED. NEXT TIME I WILL TAKE MY $75 ELSEWHERE.< /text>

Dr. Esterkyn and his staff are always so informative and friendly. My son was excited for every appointment and they made him feel special. He woke this morning to a cute little surprise celebrating the removal of his braces. I would absolutely refer people here and already have.</Text>

They say 3rd time is a charm.  This week I had my 3rd full set of braces put on and it was so much easier than I remember.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  I went back already to have spacers added and had the same warm and welcoming experience.  So far, so great!<//text>

<Review>We love Delta Smiles!! Especially now that the number of guests allowed in the office is limited. My kids are not afraid to have their appointment without me because all the staff is so nice and instantly makes them feel comfortable.  Shout out to Donna, she's one of our faves. Dr. Esterkyn is also very gentle and we are all very comfortable having our orthodontic care here.<//Review><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808ffec107b5b4a5:0x2b6c8d883da2850e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Esterkyn and his entire staff are hands down the best. I have not had one bad experience here and they treat everyone as a priority. I am so happy with my results and I will refer everyone I know to come to this office!<//review>

Delta Smiles is a good place to go when you need braces. They have nice and kind workers and they even have a rewards system so you win prizes when you get a certain amount of points. I would definitely recommend coming here.< /text>

I like how nice everyone is in the office, they do their very best to treat everyone as much as they can especially since these hard times with covid, no doubts with them at all and their staff is so nice and welcoming and the doctor knows exactly what he’s doing which makes the such a great place to go to.</Review>

Such a sweet and inviting staff! My son Charlie S. is just in the first stages of doing his first phase of braces. Everything was explained to both of us in great detail including pictures. My son suffers from anxiety disorder and they have made him feel comfortable at every visit.  This is very important to me.  Thank you Dr. Esterkyn and staff! We are excited for this adventure in orthodontics.<//text>

As soon as I walked threw the door I was greeted by pleasant smiles and hellos. Dr. Esterkyn was very polite and patient and so were the other staff. When he was putting on my braces he really took his time and overall did and excellent job. And I would definitely 100% recommend him.< /review>

I’ve been apart of Dr.Esterkyn’s office for over 10 years and they’ve become like my second family in many ways. Every single one of his staff, including the front office, have been very supportive and encouraging through my entire journey. Dr.Esterkyn has done a tremendous job helping me get the smile I’ve always wanted and always accommodates anything I may need during this process. Thank you guys!!<//Review>

<text>I was referred to this orthodontist by a family friend and my dentist, so I knew I was going to be okay.
My experience with this practice has by far surpassed just okay. They are excellent people, personal and caring. Their level of genuine care paired with the level of professionalism has left a long lasting impression with me not just my smile!!! I would recommend them to not only my family and friends but anyone looking for an orthodontist in the East Bay Area! Thank you Dr. Esterkyn and team for all that you do and most importantly how you do it !< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I have been with Dr Esterkyn for 5 years having to bring both my daughters here and I highly recommend him to my friends and family. The office is very professional, attention to detail, and staff just treat you like family.

Kirsten A (18 years old) is so much confident with her smile, she is going to smash college.

Cheyenne A (11 years old) is very happy, can’t wait to see her teeth after her braces.

If you have any orthodontic issue, just come to him, he’ll take care of you.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>We've had a great experience so far since starting with Dr. Esterkyn. From the friendliness and experience of the staff, to even Dr. Esterkyn calling us personally to check in with our daughter and how her teeth were feeling after getting the braces put in. Even the rewards card they give to the patients as a nice little incentive in keeping up with the care of their teeth. Very happy with our care so far, can't wait to see what my daughter's teeth look like after her braces. Highly recommend!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Dr. Esterkyn came highly recommended and I can definitely see why!
My son (Aiden P) needs quite a bit of work done and I was pretty anxious at the thought of it all. The entire process from beginning to end was clearly explained to me which left me feeling confident in my decision to proceed. Aside from that their office is clean, staff is friendly and they've all been great with my son. They even have a rewards system that has really pushed my son to want to participate in his treatment!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I love Dr. E’s team! As an adult with braces, I faced a lot of insecurity, but it was really cool to be cared for so well with every monthly visit. My case was more complex than the norm because I had a planned surgery involved, but Dr. E & the team were so patient, kind, fun, and communicative through it all. I looked forward to every visit, honestly.

Being a patient there myself and having numerous family members seek services there, I can’t recommend them enough!

<text>I really like the staff. They are all kind and accommodating to my needs, and they answer all of my questions with much detail to make sure I understand. My smile has come through much progress and I’m already happy with it before it is even finished with braces. Esterkyn Orthodontics is the place to go!

Absolutely love this office. Spent the last two years with my daughter here and kinda sad to go due to everyone being so friendly. Dr E had her time line exactly right when he said as long as she followed the his instructions which she did. Will recommend this office to everyone I know Looking for a good orthodontist</Review>

<Text>Dr. Esterkyn and his staff were so nice to me as soon as I walked in. I had been going to a different orthodontist before and when they looked at what he had done, they changed a lot of it because it was outdated. It was clear that Dr. Esterkyn really knew what he was doing and I am very grateful that I decided to go with them.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I like it because at the end of your braces you get like a bag full of treats and stuff so yeah that’s basically it. But sometimes I don’t want to go so yeah</text>

Both of my sons, Cage & Cash W., are patients, and our family couldn’t be happier with the entire team. From the very start everything is explained simply, they come up with a clear plan for your patient, and have a payment plan catered to you. We have zero complaints with Dr. Esterkyn o his team.< /Review>

We’re very happy with Dr Esterkyn and his team. My daughter, Jamie C,  is very comfortable with them and finds dr esterkyn, Donna and all the staff  so nice and always have a smile in their face. They take you through the process of braces step by step and as a parent I don’t have to worry about what to do which is great. So far, going to this orthodontist has been great!</Text>

< Review>
Dr. Esterkyn and his staff are wonderful. From the beginning everyone was kind, caring and professional. They were very thoughtful, taking into consideration my daughters health and temperament, while designing her care plan. When the day came to apply her braces the doctor and his assistant were very patient and thorough in explaining every step of the process., preventing any anxiety in my daughter. I highly recommend Dr. Esterkyn and his entire staff!< /Review>

Dr. Esterkyn and staff handled my daughters braces 5 years ago. It was not even a second thought to have him take care of my son as well. Their staff is amazing! Always kind, always cheerful, and always positive energy in the office. Also, he was very helpful in speeding up treatment for early removal. Very happy with the care given to both my kids!<//text>

I was a patient of Dr. Estterkyn when I was a teen and now my son is one also. Today was my son’s (Elijah D) first full appointment and had his first step of braces placed. Everyone from the front office staff to the back office was very welcoming and helpful. Donna helped explain every step and made sure my son knew all processes and cleaning items in his goodie bag. Soft foods, a whole cleaning kit for home and school, instructions, and reward system were given today- Dr. Esterkyn and his team are great.< /Text>

Amazing from beginning to end! Staff is so organized, willing to work with you, always cheery! It's difficult to coordinate schedules with all of the activities kids have today. They are always so patient when scheduling and rescheduling etc. Thank you to all that were a part of this journey and for giving my daughter a beautiful smile!!</text>

< review>
We moved here from another state when my teen was still in braces. This office declined a request for a consultation to take over treatment and remove braces. I was told flat out that there is a $1000 fee just to remove them so it would be more cost effective to fly back to the state we came from. I wanted to get a few estimates and 2 other orthodontists in town offered a friendly/free consult and detailed plans and prices. Both of which were under $1000 and included the permanent retainer. (Dr Sheffield and Dr. Louie). My younger child who also needs braces will also be using one of them.<//review>

If you're looking for a skilled Orthodontist who obviously LOVES his job, has a staff who are the most efficient and friendly people you've ever met, not to mention an office that is the state of the art complete with wifi, video games and fun movies on a big screen TV - you need to go see Dr. Esterkyn!

Both of my daughters have completed their treatment with him and their smiles are the most brilliant you've ever seen!  With all my heart, thank you to the Esterkyn team.</Review>

I am so proud of my daughter’s smile because of  Dr John Esterkyn and staff. We are coming to them almost over three years for braces.Front counter to clinical staff members are so friendly, loving and polite. We always had great service with them and strongly recommendation who wants a great orthodontist go to Dr. Esterkyn`s office.  Staff members  are very courteous and helpful. We also love the way Dr. Esterkyn does take care of his patientS. One of best Orthodontist in Brentwood!

Happy Hoildays!!

Dr. Esterkyns' staff is very friendly. I have not had a bad experience since getting my braces on (I'm almost done). Everyone at the office is very good at what they do and it shows. I will definately go back to Dr. Esterkyn's office when my kids are ready for braces.< /Review>
