They advertised one product and asked my permission to switch it with something else because they were "out" -- so off to a great start.

I asked if they accepted debit card, they said YES.
Driver did NOT accept debit and my order had to be cancelled.

No one will respond from customer service.</Review>

Its super obvious that everyone is hating on amuse in the reviews with fake reviews. They are in LA with the best menu, best website, and best prices so I get that people are scared. I just want to post this review to let all the real ones know Amuse is someone to keep an eye on. They consistently deliver.< /review>

They don't accept medical recommendations. So expect to pay $35 in taxes. They are on time or early and usually on top of their inventory.</text>

The only thing I don't understand is: why do they collect payment info online when you have to pay the driver when they arrive anyway. If they could make the purchase experience truly contactless ala DoorDash does for food delivery, I'd up this to a five star review. Otherwise good service I'll continue to use. I also appreciate the ongoing coupons they offer for future purchases. Suggest they start a loyalty program where customers can earn more savings the more they purchase.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Came in to LA for a weekend trip and decided to try out Amuse. Can’t say enough about how seamless the whole process was. Super professional from point A to Z. Definitely going to be recommending this to all my friends in the Lynwood area!</Text>

Ordered two vape carts, one of the products "mandarin cookies" was listed at thc of 93.3, when received and tried to open the "label" peeled clean off, revealing a label saying 87.3 thc. Its not that much difference but came off super shady, wouldnt use this site again ✌🏼 who knows what they putting in their product.< /Text>

Only giving two stars for the first experience I had which was great.

HOWEVER The second time, I had placed an order at 3PM for it come at 9-10PM. It wasn't until 9:45PM (WHEN I CALLED IN TO FIND OUT MYSELF TO CHECK ON MY ORDER) that they weren't able to get to me after a busy day. I get it's busy but I legit put in an order for this at 3PM for it to be delivered hours later(after finally getting through the incredibly slow website, calling the number to find out you can't place orders over the phone, only on the godforsaken site, unlike kushagram, where you can do both)
And thats one thing, I totally get it but the part that annoyed me to the point where I will not be trying this out a 3rd time(or ever again, nor recommending)....I had to call in to find out what happened, and luckily I did. I caught it in time to order from someone else at 9:50. (Kushagram btw, and who I will be sticking with for now on) Not a single person had the decency or customer service value (anywhere at all between 3PM and 9:45PM) to call me or even send a text to even let me know they wouldn't be able to get to me. I would've been waiting all night long for something that was never going to show up from a group who didn't even think to call to inform me. Beyond turned off, I've never experienced this with Kushagram, they just didn't have as many sativa options as amuse did, but at this cost, it's soooo not worth it, I'll take a Kushagram hybrid.</Text>

<Text>Absolutely love Amuse.com.

Way better than other services out there.  The unique ability to schedule your delivery, along with the amazing SMS text that keeps me updated as my order is picked, packed, and ETA times as driver gets closer.

There's been a few instances where i've forgot about my order time, stepped away to run errands, recieve a text that the driver is a few minutes away and was able to make it back in time for my order.

Hopefully in the near future other competitors in the space like Grassdoor can figure out a way to offer the same tehcnology and services</Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Good food at a reasonable price. This place is near my work, so I've eaten here many times. They have all the popular Thai dishes in lunch or dinner portions. They have an $8 lunch special with chicken, seafood, beef, pork or vegetarian options, so there's something for everyone. They serve soups, noodles, rice or curries. Their appetizers are also very good. They accommodate small or large parties easily, and orders come out very quickly. If you're in the area looking for a Thai fix, give Exotic Thai a try (no pun intended).< /Review>

Service was friendly and quick. Food was flavorful. The exotic eggrolls were meh. The pad Thai was decent, and the spicy noodle dish was good as well. Asked for Cabernet got a Chardonnay. Simple misunderstanding. Would definitely be back to try more dishes.</Text>

I came for lunch with my daughter and she ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce. The sauce was very bland and the chicken was dry. I ordered the lunch special which was chicken basil, chicken didn't  taste cooked  so I skipped on eating it and the rice was super dry.  I'm sorry for not posting photos but it all looks bland.

The only thing good was my daughters company.</text>< Pics>

as for quality, the noodle dishes come with the bare minimum (just brocoli and some bean sprouts). we also ordered the dumplings and what we received is a sad soggy wrap of unpleasant ingredients with a sickly sweet sauce.

no word how the curry is because we’re waiting on rice to try it.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_name>Aaron Engelberg<//user_name></record>

Went today 4 the first time! There were only 2 other customers, didn't allow my party of 8 to sit where we wanted. Rude customer service! Didnt greet my party, forced us to sit close to kitchen!! 2 waitresses looked mad, no smile on their faces. All talking and lsughing in thai native language? Very rude! One cutomer came in and walked out as the waitresses n the cook was rude to her! Poor cutomet services!! Would not recommend this place! What exoti? they first need to learn how to treat cutomers!! Would have walked out but with 4 young kids who wanted Thai food. There was no other Thai restaurant close by! Will NOT go there ever again!!</Text>

My local favorite! Great food, courteous and fast service and very reasonable price. Chef has French influence so the food has great flavor. We eat here maybe 3 times a month. My favorites, chicken spinach soup, garlic shrimp and, of course, their Thai ice tea! Also, when in season don't miss mango and sticky rice!!
Delicious:)<//Text>

I had been searching for good pad thai and I found it! The noodles were perfect, it was a little bit sweet, and it came without any spice so I was able to add it to my liking. I will definitely be back!</Review>

Best thai food you'll find around this area. Ask the chef (Pat) what looks good. My fav is the pad thai which I think is better than most in Hollywood (Thai town). Pleasant atmosphere, loads of parking, overall very good time. Try something new everytime you come - I have yet to be disappointed.< /Text>

<date>1572560975921<//date><resp>None</resp><rating>1< /rating><pics>None</pics><username>Amber Hoover</username><review>We stopped in Sunday afternoon, 10/27/19, for a plain black coffee.  A woman, behind the counter, was casually gossiping with a woman seated at a table.  She wasn't acknowledging that she had new customers.  Then, we noticed that she was eating.  We asked if the place was open.  She stated that she was taking a break and that she hadn't had one all day.  I'm a barista in Reno, NV.  My daughter is a barista in Laramie, WY.  We both work at very popular places, very busy, sometimes working doubles, sometimes alone.  We wouldn't think to "take a break" while customers were there, during business hours.  If you're going to the bathroom - you put up a polite sign.  If you desperately need a break - you put up a sign that apologizes and gives the customers an idea of when you'll return.  You never eat in front of customers while ignoring them.  It's the nature of that type of work.< /review>< userid>

It is always great going to Starbucks for my cup of tea! I was disappointed that my favorite flavor was not available. However, I enjoyed the Mint instead.< /text>

Best Doctor, ever!!!
Kind, gentle, patient and his whole office is the same way.
I really wish that all doctors and office workers were professional as this office. He will always be our family's ophthalmologist.</review>

Dr. Nicole Feurst is great that she explained everything and gave me a list of instructions on what to do. And will see her next month for next appointment which is great that she monitors or follow up the issue. Very satisfied.</Review>< Pics>

The office treated my strange sudden vision events as an emergency; I got an appointment the next day. Most accommodating.
I've only seen Dr.Nicole Furest. I'm quite happy with her.I need no-one else.   Armine', who works the glasses "department" makes choosing glasses, if one selects from the walls of spectacles, a breeze.<//text>

I was primarily happy because of the support staff who administered most of the tests that are usually done by the doctor.  There wasn't much of a "connect" with the actual doctor during my visit.  I will have to revisit whether or not I want to continue this relationship.</text>

Doctor Fuerst is very professional, and very courteous.  My husband is having his second lens implant corrective surgery with Doctor Fuerst.
The surgery went very well and we are very pleased.
His office and his  staff are very professional and very courteous.  Also Doctor Fuerst is very patient and takes the time needed to answer all questions.< /review>

I have complete confidence in Dr. David Fuerst’s diagnosis. It wasn’t a warm & fuzzy visit, but my priority is having confidence in a doctor’s competence and knowledge and I walked away from my visit feeling confident about Dr. Fuerst’s abilities.<//Review>

It's always hard to have a new doctor when one has had the same one "forever." That was my situation as Dr. Scheinhorn retired but seeing Dr. Nicole Fuerst was a very pleasant experience. I will have no problem having her be my regular eye doctor from now on.<//review>

I am always pleased with the care and consideration I receive!  I am deaf and with the new life including masks it is a challenge for me! Dr. Fuerst and everyone are so thoughtful and make every effort so I can understand them! Plus they never rush me or stop answering all of my questions! I highly recommend Fuerst Eye Center to anyone with eyes! 😃< /text>

Dr. Fuerst treated me for an unexpected issue on the lower eyelid. Today was a follow-up visit to recheck my eyes. She assured me that all is well. Her office is very professional and I find her to be candid about the issues with my eyes and very understanding.<//text>

A very pleasant experience for my 2nd annual visit since the Fuersts have taken over this practice.  At check-in, Andrea's thorough and professional checkup and questions asked, and the final opinion on Glaucoma and whether my diabetes is affecting the eyes by Dr. Nicole Fuerst were all nicely done.  A final checkout wave and I was outa there!<//review>

<Text>Very professional & friendly staff. Dr. Nicole & Irma were incredibly knowledgable and personable. Everyone was masked, there was hand sanitizer all over the office, & I saw them sanitizing everything in between patients. It was also easy to get an appointment (most other doctors I called were booked months in advance). Would definitely recommend them.< /Text>< pictures>

I first came to Dr Fuerst's office when my husband needed help healing a torn cornea. We turned his care over to Dr Fuerst with great confidence and now a very difficult to heal cornea has been replaced and is healing well. The office staff and nurses are thorough and everyone is efficient and friendly. While I don't suffer the problems that my husband did I too will be going to Dr. Fuerst in the future. Thank you< /review>

Best Doctor, ever!!!
Kind, gentle, patient and his whole office is the same way.
I really wish that all doctors and office workers were professional as this office. He will always be our family's ophthalmologist.<//review>

Staff are very professional and knowledgeable, specially with the Health Insurance. Dr. Nicole Feurst is great that she explained everything and gave me a list of instructions on what to do. And will see her next month for next appointment which is great that she monitors or follow up the issue. Very satisfied.< /Text>

I've only seen Dr.Nicole Furest. I'm quite happy with her.I need no-one else.   Armine', who works the glasses "department" makes choosing glasses, if one selects from the walls of spectacles, a breeze.<//Text>< user_id>

I was primarily happy because of the support staff who administered most of the tests that are usually done by the doctor.  There wasn't much of a "connect" with the actual doctor during my visit.  I will have to revisit whether or not I want to continue this relationship.< /Review>

Doctor Fuerst is very professional, and very courteous.  My husband is having his second lens implant corrective surgery with Doctor Fuerst.
The surgery went very well and we are very pleased.
His office and his  staff are very professional and very courteous.  Also Doctor Fuerst is very patient and takes the time needed to answer all questions.< /Review>

<review>It's always hard to have a new doctor when one has had the same one "forever." That was my situation as Dr. Scheinhorn retired but seeing Dr. Nicole Fuerst was a very pleasant experience. I will have no problem having her be my regular eye doctor from now on.<//review>< time>

I am always pleased with the care and consideration I receive!  I am deaf and with the new life including masks it is a challenge for me! Dr. Fuerst and everyone are so thoughtful and make every effort so I can understand them! Plus they never rush me or stop answering all of my questions! I highly recommend Fuerst Eye Center to anyone with eyes! 😃</text>

Dr. Fuerst treated me for an unexpected issue on the lower eyelid. Today was a follow-up visit to recheck my eyes. She assured me that all is well. Her office is very professional and I find her to be candid about the issues with my eyes and very understanding.< /review>

<Review>A very pleasant experience for my 2nd annual visit since the Fuersts have taken over this practice.  At check-in, Andrea's thorough and professional checkup and questions asked, and the final opinion on Glaucoma and whether my diabetes is affecting the eyes by Dr. Nicole Fuerst were all nicely done.  A final checkout wave and I was outa there!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Very professional & friendly staff. Dr. Nicole & Irma were incredibly knowledgable and personable. Everyone was masked, there was hand sanitizer all over the office, & I saw them sanitizing everything in between patients. It was also easy to get an appointment (most other doctors I called were booked months in advance). Would definitely recommend them.<//Text><date>1609825792728<//date><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Your staff. Erma, Arminai, and the receptionist, are very capable and kind. It was nice to meet Dr. David Fuerst. The technology is state of the art. Nice to see the great continuity of Dr. Scheinhorn's era.</text>

<text>I first came to Dr Fuerst's office when my husband needed help healing a torn cornea. We turned his care over to Dr Fuerst with great confidence and now a very difficult to heal cornea has been replaced and is healing well. The office staff and nurses are thorough and everyone is efficient and friendly. While I don't suffer the problems that my husband did I too will be going to Dr. Fuerst in the future. Thank you<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>This was my first visit since the retirement of Dr. Scheinhorn. I found Dr. Nicole to be very professional and engaging. She was concerned about me as a patient and the health of my eyes. Her optometrist has become a friend and has done everything to assist me with my glasses.

I look forward to my next visit with Dr. Nicole.</Text>< Rating>

Dr. Fuerst treated myself and my wife with outmost respect and best possible eye exam that we could ever expect.  We are awaiting to get the two eye glasses; one for me and one for my wife, to always come back for our yearly eye exam at this facility.  Thank you Dr. Fuerst and the staff.< /review>

<Text>I had chemical spill damage to the hood of my 2014 Subaru Forester.  Dave Garcia and crew (including office staff) did a fantastic job of repair and repaint.  I picked my car up today and it was fully detailed and looked like new!

I would advise anyone to allow an extra day or so to the time estimate to help insure they are not rushed and can continue their quality work.

I would recommend this auto-body shop to everyone.  Easy access while your car is being renewed using BART to Balboa Park Station then the #8 Muni bus to the Carter Street stop.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I brought my 2013 Lexus in for glass and door repair after someone broke into my car and smashed the window. My experience at J&M was exceptional, with unusual friendliness, transparency and thoroughness throughout the process. No surprises, no "gotcha" moments. A little while later my car was ready and it looks good as/better than new. Hopefully I won't need repairs soon but I won't hesitate to give J&M my car in the future.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Since I saw and entered this great company I told myself that it was the perfect one to do all the painting work and I knew that the painting work that they would develop and carry out would be surprising, since I entered the establishment I felt positive , confidence and great security in myself and that they transmit.
I did not feel that sensation a long time ago, from that moment I had too many ideas and a great desire to develop many jobs and carry them out with this great and perfect company J&M Auto body. It changed all my thoughts radically and I had great positivity within my extraordinary. This company is different from the others for the great services and the best that can exist that they gave me, I loved all the aspects they have and how they do it.
Quickly notice that the employees love the wonderful work that this great team does and this is what gives life and positivity to this company J & M Auto body, they have great potential in all their jobs and even if they have a problem they solve it They do not set any limits, they go ahead and face all the problems that are presented to them, excellent all their labor aspects.

They are the best on the market, I took a car to repair and they left it perfect, quality parts until now have not failed me again.  What impressed me the most was the treatment I received and how I received the super detailed car, washed and vacuumed, highly recommended if your car failed and you have little money to repair it they are your best option, they fit your budget.  super recommended, they are also super friendly and they give you several options that suit you better or that better fit your budget, they do not make you overspend.  This workshop is highly recommended, both mechanical and sheet metal with quality paint, I have my car that was painted a year ago and the painting remains the same as it left the workshop.< /review>

team completed body work repairs for me after a rear-end accident.  They did a great job, it looks amazing and they worked closely with the rental car company to make everything smooth for me.  They even delivered my car to me after the work was done!  In addition, they kept me informed regularly, I would get a status update every other day, or every day depending on how the work was going.  They took my communication preferences into account and were really a complete joy to work with.  I'll definitely come back if I ever need auto body repairs again.  Highly recommend!<//review>

<text>Great customer service and on time. Mike the manager is amazing and worked with me on fixing my Mercedes Benz A200. He was very personable and I received the best experience ever. They gave me a discount for going on several occasions. I'm very happy with my experience at J&M Auto Body. I would like to recommend to those looking to make a change to their cars, they will be super responsible with their work. Family Leon in the house! Luis.< /text>< Name>

<text>I had a great experience. Their employee Alex took the time to explain what was going on with my car in a way that was easy to understand. The pricing is fair and they set you up with an account that rewards you points with every service so you can earn free services. Their shuttle took me to work in the morning after I dropped off my car so I didn’t have to worry about that. They really care about providing quality customer service.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Excellent place to repair your car !.  I went to fix the back of my car because I had a crash, everyone told me that there was no fix, that it was better for me to think about buying another car because the one I had no longer had a solution.  One day when I met a friend, he recommended this workshop to me, he told me that he had brought his car that was even in worse condition than mine and that it was fixed and left as new.  At that moment a hope came to me, I did not think twice and the next day I took my car to this workshop.  The employees were very kind to attend to me, they explained what they should do and they told me in detail what the full cost of the repair would be.  Before that, I thought it would cost me an eye to fix it, but when he showed me the ballot I was surprised, because it wasn't even half of what I had thought I would have to pay.  Their costs are cheap and they charge you what is necessary.  The atmosphere is amazing, it's in a good place and it's not far.  I am grateful to these people for helping me get my car back.  It was the best thing that could happen to me because I love my car very much.  Thank you very much for your help.< /Text>

First of all, to thank the first-class attention from that moment, I knew that I would return, without leaving aside the quality and the commitment to detail, being a perfectionist client for anything, it is difficult to please me and in this workshop they managed to fill all my expectations.

Total thanks for everything. I will definitely be back very soon and with many family and friends to receive the best of the best.

blessings and success.<//review>

I would definitely go back here again.  I had a bumper repaired and repainted by another store and it was a long way off.  I paid a fair amount of money now that the guy is ducking.  I came here on the recommendation of my cousins ​​and gave this guy a chance.  At first I was suspicious but they took great care of me I must say I left it on Tuesday night, I got it back on Friday morning the same WEEK!  Great man, can you even tell me on Thursday and said: Hey, come to your car!  We were scared because this was too fast and the whole old body shop I was through was sooo slow.  I must say that this guy was a man of his word.  The car looks super clean and cool!  I'm going to recommend this store to my friend and boy, here comes more business for this boy!<//review>

This place is always the best among many, I gave them a chance to repair my ford raptor and they didn't disappoint me And the experience with them is just great as there are very few places like this, I loved their work, it was fast, economical, friendly.
I would definitely recommend them and give them 5 stars.
A couple of greetings, I hope and your work goes up and keep doing the best things.<//Text>

These guys did an amazing job on my custom Jeep work! Brought them a stock Jeep Wrangler with an extensive list of changes I wanted made to the Jeep. Custom pain work, custom stereo work, custom lift, etc etc. Jon worked very closely with me and went above and beyond what I could have asked for. Any questions or concerns I had after the fact were handled promptly. Thanks for an amazing job.< /review>

<text>My car was damaged and it needed to be painted so I started to look for a very good place and I found this awesome place. Believe me you are not going to find a better place. J&M auto body is the best option, they are very kind and honest, I got a very very incredible service. My car was repaired quickly and I'm so impressed with the results because my car was scratched and also it was a little bit crashed so when I went to pick up my car it was as if it was new, I really loved the new color the painting is of high quality. I couldn't believe that it was my car. So I fully recommend this place, if your car needs to be repaired or painted you have to visit J&m auto body. I'm not exaggerating, if you want to check it, you can go there and you will be surprised.<//text>< pics>

If I could I even gave them 10 stars! 🌟<//Text>

I will tell you about my experience. I am going to complete a month that will take me to fix this place because I had my damaged car and they solved the problem that I had is something incredible because I had already taken it previously to other workshops and it was always damaged again. I am going to be a month old and the car is fascinating as it goes and it does not fail me at all, in addition to that they are very friendly and effective in the work that they offer without a second thought I would recommend it and in fact they also paint cars so in these weeks they will have me for there</text>

I want to congratulate the owner of the workshop for his work, also his workers are very punctual and do their job well. I have brought my car to your store more than twice because they make your car look like new. I recommend this workshop.< /Review>

J&M is by far the most professional skilled honest and dependable auto body shop that anyone could need.
I had a small scrape on my Tesla and the shop did a great job in a short time. I picked up my car and similes as I drove away.

<rate>5<//rate><Review>If you are in Daly city Ca  or in its surroundings, and you require a friendly and quality service in body shop and car painting, do not hesitate to visit the J&M Auto boody workshop. He will personally attend to you and will be the one to carry out the work with the responsibility of who runs his own business. It is likely that you will be tempted to make friends with him, and rest assured that you will not be the first; He is also a teacher with more than twenty years of experience in the service, and one more reason to place trust in him is that the workshop is at home. From the painting of a rearview mirror to the total change of the color of a car, plus the damage to the body that is repairable, I have seen him work them in detail and trade.<//Review>< Name>

<Review>Going to JYM is very pleasant, safe and profitable since I had a problem with the car's brass and in less than a week I had already received an email that it was ready and without the hit, it was profitable since it was not very high the cost and I felt very safe to leave my car there since I realized that they have many years of experience in this work, congratulations for the good work I am very satisfied with my result!

J&M Auto Body is a company that without a doubt the years of experience have been to perfect and improve the techniques to fix the vehicles since it does not matter the year, make and type of vehicle and so complex is the problem since they have the solution for all types of vehicles, and thanks to this, customers leave with the satisfaction of returning and trusting their hands to work on the vehicles. Without a doubt it is the best workshop in the area and as I recommend them, there will be many more people who will also do it.<//Review>

As I say, take care of your car as you would take care of your family and your business, that's why I leave it to J&M, so that I can continue doing many miles with it.  Great workshop and great service.<//text>

My father gave me his 1991 bmw e34, which was very fond of him and I was the same.
They restored it better than new it was actually something very moving, thanks to this body shop I can feel that my father goes with me everywhere.
Thanks again to J&M Auto body</Review>

In addition, they are very punctual in their work and have the best quality in the area.👊🏼🚗🚗< /text>

100% recommended for those of us who are an anti-stock car club, the attention from the moment you arrive is very respectful, they are very friendly, they let you know the variety of services they offer, and they explain in detail what you want to do with their vehicle, the good thing is that the attention is from professionals and they give confidence to put our beloved car in their hands, you can see the process of the work they do, experts in exotic cars, and best of all is the price in comparison from other places this is for many dollars less and the work is worth it, excellent service, thanks< /Review>

I am very happy with the attention I received, very friendly in this place since they attended me to make a budget, which I accepted since they gave me a great price, I could say that it was the best of those that I quote, the quality of its materials. They used are the best on the market, we agreed with a delivery day and they delivered me earlier than agreed, very punctual with their work that was impeccable, I recommend it to all people, excellent service< /Review>

Having a car for the first time is very exciting since you think it is a very important achievement that you get to achieve in life, but behind this is that the car needs unforeseen repairs, taking my car to this highest level with the greatest possible distrust , but hey I left it and when I was already repaired I have a magnificent job such as an agency and be surprised with his wonderful work, now I already have a very safe place for my car when I need it, I am satisfied and I recommend that you take your car with peace of mind if it's your first time.......</Review>

<review>Well, the experience that my family and I had in the business was excellent, and I say this for several things and one of them is that the manager and workers are very friendly, they left us very satisfied with the work they did in our car, we came to this business on the recommendation of friends of my family, and we have already recommended it, we had heard that people told us that they were not satisfied with the work they did in other businesses but here is another experience, if you want a good job in time and form this is the right place.< /review>< Pictures>

It is the best car service that I know because when my car crashed they fixed it for me and they left it as new with the best parts on the automotive market and the best thing is that they charge very cheaply, they are punctual regarding work and they are polite.<//Review>

Thank you so much !!
my car looks like new after i hit
my mother-in-law's house, the bad news is that it can kill me when she invites me to eat hahaha, the good news is that you are taken down from heaven you have the hands of the gods they equaled everything perfectly nor is it noticeable that I already hit you or took you away I recommend it a lot of paint and the best thing is the price is worth everything !!!!
thanks guys i love you< /Text>

Three weeks ago I had a car accident and it was between two cars both back and forth and upside down so my dad and I went to this establishment and they fixed it perfectly, already taking advantage of the that we had the car there we decided paint it which was also very good. We recommend the place as it took almost nothing to fix it, it is very good and above all the prices are very affordable.</Review>

I am more than happy with the result, of my Volkswagen BeetleI, it has been more than a year since I acquired this mobile car since my grandfather left it to me as an inheritance and I had thought to take it as a project that I wanted to carry out I was looking for almost half a year to the right people but nobody wanted to cheer up they just made me waste time and money since the car was not in very good condition It had some knocks and a very large one at the passenger door and let's not let it pass that because of the age it was very badly painted and somewhat choppy since it is from the year 1984, it should be noted that I live in Tijuana and I had already decided to leave it arumbado and forget me for good, until a coworker told me about a place in California and I was encouraged to go since I had to go visit my parents in the same city and OMG was simply amazed the team work He was super friendly, the attention they give you is fabulous as a client makes you feel very comfortable and that your car is in very good hands, the paint and grommets result was fantastic. The knocks and the chopped no longer exist and the quality of paint and workmanship is top, I really could not reconstruct my car as it was before, I feel that I am spilling flow wherever I go thanks to the excellent service of my brothers from J & M Auto body! It is the best option to give a radical change to your car and your life, they managed to relive the great memory of my grandfather who lives in that car and increased all the flow and style I needed, thanks to them all turn to see my baby and I feel proud, I have always believed that you are what you drive and now thanks to my brothers I drive the best. Thanks for making my car a great legend.< /Text>

I could give it more than a thousand stars, but it only allows me to put 5.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7eb8a73f6be9:0x18c23306be7d6a36< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Hello very good afternoon, I introduce myself I am a customer of this branch, the work they do is very appropriate since it shows their proper planning for each type of different cars, I like the way of customer service, the order and succession they give to the  car, also one of my observations is that they look at the minimum details and that makes the work stand out, I am leaving with a very good experience and above all I will return.  Thanks J&M auto body< /Review>

<Review>Good afternoon, I want to thank the paint shop for the wonderful quality of work that was done in my car, the excellent customer service and the effort made by the workers of the J&M workshop, and I am very happy, thank you and it is 100% recommended. But the best thing is the price.

When choosing a mechanical workshop that satisfies you, I recommend J & M Auto body, because the same attention as you wold when choosing is very good! Omg! A good plumbler or electrician for your car. How a maserati white that did i see 🤩< /text>

They left my car as as if it wave new seriously friends I recommend that they take their cars they leave then impeccable as if they were brought from the agency friends seriously I recommend this workshop

I have 10 years of visiting J&M AUTO BOBY and they have never failed me with what I always ask them I am a very strict person but at J&M AUTO BOBY  if they understand me they always leave my car as I service and very special administrative staff I 100% recomend the J&M workshop for all kinds of repair for your car ✌</review>

It is a great place to take your car, excellent service and they are very friendly, without wanting your car to have a better paint than when you bought it, this is the right place. If there were more stars to qualify this workshop would put thousands of stars</Review>

It is the best you can find for your car, they left it to me as if it had just been taken out of the agency, they got me parts since my car is a classic and I was afraid to take it to another place. 100% trust, treatment and punctuality RECOMMENDED<//Review>

the best paint and eyelet shop there is, excellent service, they left me totally satisfied with their work, honesty, and responsibility, for the good way of working and the tortuously affordable price I leave with a smile from ear to ear there is no more what to say<//review>

I had been having problems with the paint of my Mercedes Benz car, it was ruined after a crash that I had, a friend recommended this workshop, I decided to go since I was surprised with the good attention they gave me, they make you feel immediately as in your home, they checked the damage and they told me to come back 2 days later, so I did and discovered that it had been left as new, the price is excellent, they deliver it to you just in time it was a very rewarding experience, my Mercedes was even better that before I recommend 100% in honor of the truth.<//Review>

<Text>unfortunately my new bmw crashed and was damaged, the agency charged me too much, they recommended this workshop and since I arrived they treated me in the best way and they told me that without any problem they left it as new and without the need to spend a lot of money  .  OMG, the result was the best, it seemed agency again 😍😍😍.

It is the best workshop there is, I will treat myself well and have a good service, I take my bmw to the workshop since I had a crash and in the other workshops I take my car it was very expensive, a friend recommended me to go to this workshop because he said that  It is cheap and I went, and if it is super cheap a comparison of other workshops that you spend three times and this one does not, super good service and cheap prices</review>

<text>The only place outside of NY that has good pizza. The quality is great. Prices and great and they deliver for cheap too. They delivered to my house 3 times  however, the last time they told me I was to far to deliver which is upsetting and weird because they did twice before. I still get it whenever I'm in the area which isn't to often but the pizza is always good. Give it a try</text>< user>

Not at all what I expected after reading their ratings. The pizza thin and greasy. I could have got better at Little Cesar's and paid $15.00 less. I do not recommend this place. If you want a good pizza go to either Felipe's or La Bellas.</text>

I absolutely love this place! Their service is so friendly and their pizza and wings are so good. The crust is a legit New York style pizza crust with the extra flour and everything and the wings are perfectly cooked every time. I would highly recommend this place<//text>

Incredible customer service! This place goes above & beyond to make sure their customers are happy. On top of that, their ny style pizzas & garlic knots are really tasty!! I’d go out of my way to get pizza here.</Text>

<Text>They are now offering individual pizzas. I had the Marguerite pizza and it was delicious! And for dessert I had the cannolis which were also very good. My order was ready when I was told it would be, and the staff are very nice! I use to go in for the slices, but the individual pizza was even better. I will be going more often. I hope they continue the individual pizzas even after the covid lockdown is over.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I stopped in here to see what it was all about. I am a big fan of Bronx pizza and I want to see how this would compare. I must say I am a fan of this restaurant. I will not go as far as to say it is the same as Bronx pizza because this is more of a Long Island style. The sauce is great the crust is great and the toppings are of a high quality. I like the fact that they have regular Italian style thin crust pizza as well as Sicilian pizza. The white stone is good the pepperoni mushroom was excellent and I also like the fact that they have garlic powder, parmesan as well and red chili flakes for you to put on your pizza. When I ordered my slice the employees here notice that the pizza was already  a little old so they made me fresh slices. This really shows the type of customer service that is needed in any service industry. I would recommend this pizza place and I will be back. The lady that was working at the front Ashley was very nice and very helpful. The gentleman that was cooking the pizzas name was Adrian he was the one that noticed that the pizza that they were going to serve me was a bit old so they made fresh ones. That to me shows the attention to detail that is needed. I am very happy with the service.<//review>

< review>
Today I went there and got two pies. The lady at the front was rude and charged me $19.00 per pie instead of $18.00 like the menu on the wall said. I tried to politely explain that you have to charge the advertised price but she told me that she charged what her "system" tells her to. I got frustrated and raised my voice becoming agitated by her not understanding where I was coming from. A man making the pizza heard this and came from around back, telling her to refund the difference. I don't like being the bad guy, and she shouldn't have made me push the issue.  Otherwise the order was fast and pizza was good.  Please update your menu prices to avoid this situation.

Went there again, same story, over charged me and I went through the same back a forth about being fair and charging the price on the menu. They are ridiculous, rude and fraudulent.Don't shop here, buy pizza at Gaetanos, at least they will charge you the menu price and the pizza will be better.</review>

< review>
I'm from Brooklyn so I know new York pizza and I do have to say they come as close as it gets. So yeah for the pizza it's worth it. Reason for the 4 stars is because I got the sausage calzone and it was not that good. But the pizza 5 stars< /review>

Try the mushroom and cheese and the white sauce with ricotta cheese. I'm going back. My uber driver wanted to look at the two slices I got to go. He was impressed. Good service, clean, and friendly. A good addition to SV.< /review>

<Text>I had seen the Casa De Oro location in passing a few times, and finally decided to put in an order for a large deluxe. Called in at 4PM before starting to drive home, was told 20-25 minutes. Cool, it should be ready by the time I get there. I get there 40 minutes later, and discover that the order was never printed, so nothing has even been started. Not cool. Cashier says, 'You wouldn't mind waiting for it to be ready, right?' 'So... ANOTHER half hour?' 'Nah, like, 20-25 minutes...' That's a half hour on top of the 40 minutes already wasted, for a total of almost an hour and a half for a pizza that was supposed to take 20 minutes. I cancelled my order and left after that. I don't recommend going here unless you have spare time for the restaurant to waste.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Been living in casa-de-oro for 19 years and this is the best pizza I’ve had here yet. The dough and sauce they use is especially good. Would highly recommend! Any of the other reviews that gave 1-2 stars were probably just salty cause they had a bad day or something and they took it out ok Mike’s so go ahead and disregard their review.<//Review>

I'm here now, been here a few times. The food is not good, I'm always in the area. The sad thing they spent lots of money on a total remodel, but its always to HOT inside. It's so hot I'm very uncomfortable eating inside. No excuse for not having a good AC unit keeping it cool inside. The first girl they hired already quit to HOT.  I have been back a few more times, I hope I'm wrong I do hope Long Island's pizza makes it, but I feel they will not. I never see anyone inside eating just a few. It's very stuffy inside with a bad AC system not cooling it down to be  Comfortable for customers. The water in restroom never works that well to rinse your hands. With pizza hut so close not to sure. I will go back maybe but will only take my food to go. Plus the photo is of Starbucks to strange. Hopefully they make it. I eat all over in the area no other  Restaurant is so stuffy. Plus if you never see people inside eating it drives  Customers away. 10-11-2018 Stoped in again was going to get a few slices to go looked over the pizza it looked like it was 10 hours old . I just left went to pizza hut it was great. I can't think of any reason to eat there anymore. I have tried it three times really not good and always something not right. To hot, pizza not fresh looking bad. Not for me hopefully they stay in business but I don't think they will.< /text>

I had been renting my storage from us storage centers for 6 years when it was time for me to close out my account and empty my storage I met Christopher he was so helpful. Christopher was very very kind and professional and I give him an A+. He was very attentive to my needs and I didn't feel rushed. I have rented about 6  storage and the service was the best one. I will recommend this place to anybody and everybody</Review>

I’m so grateful to Christopher for helping us get into our storage when we lost our keys. Very respectful staff. The prices are the best, and storage units are kept safe. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good storage place.< /text>

Chris and staff were very friendly, professional and honest.  They were flexible in helping me meet my needs and willing to go the extra step.  It made the paperwork process fly by and I am very pleased with my choice in storage units.  I recommend using US Storage in Hemet off State Street.< /text>

<review>I have rented several storeage units in different locations.  But after my experience with Denise Donnelly I will never rent space anywhere else again other then Cube Smart. From the moment I walked in to pay my bill wich was late , she made me feel as if I was her #1 customer. I have been needing to arrange for a bigger storeage and even a second one close to where we are moving to ? but kept putting it off because there's so many places and sizes and prices to chose from. Denise was able to figure out what exactly I would need and shared with me the great deals I can choose from, including the refer a friend . It was exactly what I needed . Her upbeat personality and sincerest desire she had to give me peace of mind and spend the time showing me how cube smart truely could meet every one of my needs has made me a loyal customer for life.  The experience here has been like a breath of fresh air. Thank you Denise for your help . Now I can focus on our move without worrying about anything related to storeage units.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>From day one when I rented here I have been very pleased.
Denise was the first to help me and, not only
Did she make this a pleasant transaction she helped me get a 20 foot haul truck to my unit. This was no easy task and took About 15 minutes of going forward, backing up. I would not recommend bringing that big of a truck in. Thank God she had patience and was able to help guide me.
I then had a small issue with my lock and I was fortunate enough to get to meet Chanel. What a great person. She switched out my lock straight away.
Another day there was an issue with the gate and they had to close all of a sudden because the gate was t working properly and they needed a part in order to fix it. Wouldn’t you know that was the day that I was meeting someone to pick up 50 boxes of flooring from 2 hours away. Chanel rescued me and I was able to get this done. Chanel and Denise go above and beyond their job description. This is what I not only practice but, truly appreciate. Way to make a customer for life. My slogan when I sell real estate.
Cube smart way to go for hiring such awesome people.
People like these two ladies keep your clients happy and with that it makes us want to refer our friends and family to rent from you.
My only gripe is that rates go up in 6 months. I’m not loving that plan.</text>< Pictures>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>Channel is incredible. The move-in process (even during the COVID-19 pandemic) was fast and flawless. The price was reasonable with the discount I received.

I stopped by a few days ago & when I walked in the office I was greeted with 2 amazing smiles. Both Chanell & Denise were very professional & extremely knowledgeable. They assisted me in finding the right size for the best price. I walked in super stressed & walked out feeling refreshed. This type of service don't exist anymore. I will recommend Cube Smart in the future.
Thanks ladies & keep up the good work.<//text>

<review>Horrible customer service. This place has great prices if you ever need help with your storage they do not value their customers the way they should. The only thing they value is the money you spend. If you ever need to negotiate a family circumstance such as the loss of a loved one or a national state of emergency they do not care.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We are very sorry to hear about the inconvenience you experienced while trying to access our facility. We would like to further connect and learn more of the situation. Please email your best contact information to contactus@usstorage.net and a manager will reach out shortly. Thank you.'}</Resp><text>I would give 0 stars but that is unfortunately not an option. Cube smart as a whole is ok BUT this specific location is horrible.... management (or I should say lack of) is nonexistent, anytime you try to contact someone directly they are never available you will always have to get in touch with their corporate and then corporate will get in touch with management which is just inconvenient. The main reason I am giving this location a 0 is due to our vacate issue. I called corporate (due to not being able to reach the manager)to inform that I would be moving and gave the date corporate explained that they would send an email to the manager to inform and give the date I would be moving and that the manager would reach out to me (which never happened). A few days later I emailed the manager regarding my move and the date because the only email I had received was an auto email reminding me of my payment. She did respond to my email and confirmed my move and sent all information regarding the vacate process. Day of my move my husband pulls up in the uhaul we just rented for 400$ enters our code and it doesn’t work. We call corporate who then calls the manager and they say the gate is broken and we have to wait till the following day!!!!!!! We were given no notice!!!!! According to the manager it broke the night before which I completely understand things happen but not giving any notice is just completely unprofessional and unacceptable. Luckily uhaul gave us a free day at no charge. Next day I called the corporate office to make sure the gate will be open and when corporate spoke to the emergency contact because manager was unavailable (how convenient) they stated the gate was still down and would be for the next 2 days. My husband had already taken off work and we had already paid for our uhaul I could not even believe that these people do business like this. After a heated conversation with corporate, management said they can manually open the gate. That is what should of happened to begin with!!!! I never write reviews but due to this huge inconvenience and horrible management I believe people should know how business is ran at this location. Beware.</text>< gmap_id>

I loved it here! They are awesome 😁. Chanelle is the best! She is so nice, actually they all are nice but I mainly talked to her & she didn’t even get frustrated when the other lady couldn’t open the lock she was more concerned on apologizing but it was no big deal I enjoyed talking to both of them!<//review>

<review>I needed a storage unit for my mom and Chanell was so sweet and helpful. She walked my mom through the entire process and was very knowledgeable. After visiting various storage facilities my mom felt most comfortable storing her items at Cube Smart because of Chanell. The entire process was quick and efficient and a fun experience with Chanell.< /review>< Pics>

Meanwhile my ex-boyfriend got ahold of my storage unit and let it go to auction. Therefore I lost over 3k worth of furniture and things that had sentimental value to my family and I. I moved down to this area, stayed less than a month and quickly moved back to Northern California. I'm disgusted and at a loss for words by what happened.< /Text>< pics>

There was a really nice person when I went to see about getting storage two weeks ago. I went there a few days ago, and what a difference. The woman was new, and didn't make me feel welcome at all. I told my friend who rents there that I didn't feel good about being there anymore so I rented next door. She said met the supervisor of Sure Save American last week and she said that she's just as rude as the new employee because she had negative things to say about the previous employees that we did like, it's STORAGE. No matter how crazy you thought your employee was, she was a lot nicer than what is there now, and how rude and unprofessional of the supervisor!. Needless to say, I rented elsewhere. This really bothers me because I really felt good about the place until the change.</review>

Worst company that I have ever done business with!!! Run don not use!!!  They change rates without warning.  They are very quick to place liens.  They can be rude at times.  They do not update information, and blame you.< /review>

Never receive notices or updates or changes by mail or phone calls, they changed my pass code and did not  notify me. I will be moving from here very soon. They also need to open on Sunday's , this makes no sense.< /Review>

Veronica and Levi are great employees. Their  mood is great and very helpful. She deserves to manage the bar! After being in restaurants for 15 years it’s easy to recognize real talent that’s honest.< /text>

Bartenders are excellent, efficient and friendly. Fish tacos are excellent but the onion rings tend to be grossly over cooked and over salted too much just the next evening.</review>

For me...this place is a dump. So dark that you'll never see the roaches crawling on the floor. Smells like stale beer as you walk in. Honky tonk music blares over any conversation.  (Might wanna learn sign language) And food was fresh from the microwave. Oboy!!!! Stay outta here....
Unless maybe ya enjoy that kinda stuff!!<//text>

First time here and would come back everytime to this place every time I'm in this town. Came on a Tuesday and they have $1.50 fish tacos and they are amazing, really good flavor, big piece of fish and lots of goodies on top that dont overpower the fish taste. Might head to the bar and have a drink also, looks really nostalgia and I like that type of place</Review>

This is your neighborhood dive bar.... it's a lot of fun... serves fantastic tacos on Tuesdays.  I particularly love the shrimp tacos.. . And the bar tenders are so very nice.  Lots of line dancing too, where it is easy to learn the steps with all the people who welcome and help you along.  Fun fun fun!!!</Review>

Well it was my first time there today and I went there because I'm addicted to karaoke so I did discover that the lovely KJ Laura from the Pit Stop was running , so that was nice. The dance floor was really large n the lighting was great service they gave it with a smile but you had to go and get what you wanted and if it was food than they bring. The price for the food was good, although it was all a little salty for my taste but I know in bars that's what they want they want you to drink more by giving salt. I don't know if  I'll be back again because for me it's like almost a 45 minute drive and I probably would have been able to sing three songs had I stayed that's a long way to go to do 2. I would say it is probably a great place for karaoke for those that are in the neighborhood I also noticed they had a pool table.n the clienttell were quite nice a mixed group of ages and races.👌🏼👍😃😎</Text>

< Review>
What can I say...Ponderosa Bar & Grill is a cool place.  Good food and great service. The music and karaoke drew my wife and I here and we made some new friends. I was a karaoke virgin before last night and will be coming back again and again.  I know ownership has been making improvements to enhance the establishment.<//Review>

This place has 4 pool tables that are free on some nights. They also have cornhole and BEER PONG! That's pretty cool for bars around here. Also, they have a DJ on some nights. Lots of room and a dance floor. Cheap drinks. I'll be coming here more.< /Text>< Pictures>

So I think I had the best food ever. Wow these guys know what fresh things like this for me and my Administration instructor who was a busy guy who had to fix my own problems with the best way to happiness.  Eating healthy foods can help your body today and your health needs help you and me and your body today< /Review>

The only way it would be more "dive bar" is if they only accepted cash. They happen to accept plastic. Regulars for days in this place.

A friendly dive bar in sun city.  The karaoke host is great. Was there on Sunday. He has a great sound system and a fair rotation . Moderate price for food and drinks.  Older crowd mostly a few young people.< /Review>

What a dump of a place. Few people very cool. I would guess about 80% of the people on meth. I have not a clue as to what happened to the grill. Alot of the people have a bottle of booze stashed on them.
PLACE JUST SUCKS BIG TIME!!!!!<//text>

<Text>Bar that seems to cater to the older crowds. When I say "older" I mean those 65 and up. The food is okay. Pitstop has way better food. However the person at Pondersoa (new girl don't know name) makes great salsa for the chips. And Tue and Wed nite there is no cook at all. That sucks since Karaoke is at 7 pm to 12 pm Wed nites. You'd think if they said "Tue and Wed bites are our slow notes so we don't have a com those nights" may be if they hire a cook for notes - more would come in? I go for the Karaoke and wine. NOT for the food. The club is a great sandwich. I've enjoyed that. I like the Pitstop since they have a younger crowd and more 20s-30s - and I like feeling younger than I am. (I'm in my early 40s).<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dc9e1039183b51:0x6a889af8ec16c050<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Even though I already wrote a review, it seems to have vanished, forcing me to write another. The clientele is the biggest drawback here. Well, that and the owner's complete unwillingness to offer viable security. It's a dive bar, so expect sticky seats and a bar brawl or two once the sun sets and the elderly have gone home. Serioisly, they had a fight break out there during a show, guys swinging on women, the whole 9. Ezra, the owner, doesn't bother with calling the police, he just locked the door trapping everyone in the parking lot (where women were being beaten by men) and keeping one band from retrieving their gear. Idiotic seems an inadequate adjective to describe the owner and management, here. A shame really, as there really is only one other option in Menifee at the Pitstop; but I don't like moto-x or KCAL enough to frequent that place. Recommend stopping by Sun City Liquor and just drinking at home.< /Review>< user_name>

Great customer service. They have a rewards program. The chocolate coffee smoothie with boba is delicious. Also recommend the Thai tea float.< /Review>

<name>Ileana Gonzalez< /name><Review>I have tried the golden nova, and about two more drinks. They are good but it is all about the taste preference of the people. It is a nice shop. I’m not to fond of the prices but heck we pay for other stuff that we really don’t need so I can’t complain. I like coming here they have a points system when entering your number. Also they will stop using the five star rewards starting July 1st according to a sign in the front but they weren’t giving any points since this week.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>112772468429489195495< /userid></record>

<Date>1550603381768</Date><Text>A local tea spot from where I live which serves good tea. I wouldnt call it amazing, but since it is local a good place to grab a quick cup of ice milk tea. My favorite type of tea is black so I would recommend oolong or assam. If you like it sweet I would suggest adding a scoop of ice cream to make make it sweet and creamier. Over all they have good prices and wide variaty of selection to drink from. They also have 5 star reward programs and after a certain amount of visits will give out a free drink. A cool place to check out if in the area.< /Text></record>

<Review>The teas are refreshing and delicious 😋 I got the thai tea and milk tea. It made my day. I had a nice experience there.

Please open a location in Long Beach so I don’t have to drive far to get my fix.<//Review>< gmap_id>

But A week ago
i went to go get a bite to eat, and got picked up
Then when i got home the next day i lost my bag of art supplies
I was so glad they found what i lost And kept it waiting for the owner to be back
Not all heroes wear capes XD
And that Monday really made my day.
Do recommend a good place to eat with your friends or a place to relax,
just remember you have everything with you.</review><GmapID>0x80c2c920ddc1a6ff:0x542638209c48bd6a</GmapID>< name>

Karen and I have been shopping for a new mattress
for a while visiting several stores and trying several different kinds.  I found Mattress Firm on line so we visited your showroom in Costa Mesa where we were greeted by salesman Adam Cortes.  Adam was very knowledgeable, informative, had good suggestions about what might be a good fit for us, and was very
patient.  We gathered the information we needed and then a few 2days later returned to purchase a mattress.  Adam walked us through the purchase and financing processes in a smooth manner. We would have no hesitation in referring others to Adam.< /text>

He explained things very well so that I was able to easily understand even the technical details. He expertly recommended a product that fit my budget.
Honestly, I really appreciate how he treated me, and I’ll be sure to actively recommend him to my friends nearby and the Asian community. Clay was really the best employee!!!<//Text>< Pics>

I bought on Tuesday a new mattress and I was advised on the selection by Carl. He is an outstanding advisor! The mattress was delivered today and I am really excited to sleep on it😊</Text>

We were driving around all day, going to different stores, and were about to give up, when we found this place. He truly took care of us by finding us the best deal! We walked out with a king sized bed, 2 insanely comfortable pillows, sheets, and protector sheets all within our budget. When you guys visit look for Clayton!< /Review>< Pictures>

We stopped by just to check out the mattresses and didn’t expect to find anything just yet, but we actually did thanks to Steve! Steve was great and helped us choose the mattress that best fits our needs. He also made us feel comfortable and gave us the space and time to feel the mattresses. Thanks Steve!</Review>

Incredibly pleasant experience thanks to Clayton Spires, he was very polite and super helpful/informative. I don't usually review places but my experience was so good here I'm more than happy to share. I highly recommend going to this store if you're thinking about purchasing a new mattress. I was planning on purchasing something online but decided to pop into this store to get some more info on a particular mattress I was interested in and Clayton ended up helping me buy it for half the price it was online thanks to a deal the mattress company had with Mattress Firm. I was blown away.<//Text>

<text>Clay was a fantastic sales representative! He went above and beyond to ask the right questions and make sure I bought the perfect mattress set for my needs! I appreciate his working hard to get me the best deal for my purchase. He was friendly and knowledgeable about all of your products. I didn’t want to go into a store during the pandemic, and he made purchasing over the phone a pleasure! I highly recommend Mattress Firm, and will refer friends who are looking for mattresses to you and Clay for his excellent customer service!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Today I walked into the store not really knowing what type of bed I was looking for. Clay was awesome. He walked me through the store, answered all of my questions and addresses all my concerns.  He helped me find a mattress that fits my budget and I think I got a pretty sweet deal.
Clay’s cool vibe and easy going personality  made mattress shopping less confusing and a whole lot less stressful!<//Text><username>Diana Pequeno< /username><Rating>5< /Rating>< resp>

My fiancé and I went looking for new pillows and Adam was the biggest help. He was showing and teaching us how important pillows are for your body, and helped us find the perfect pillows for the both of us. We learned that with him being a back sleeper and me a stomach sleeper, we need very different pillows. 10/10 Thank you Adam< /Review>

<Time>1610079443796</Time><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>In this time when everything has become so difficult Steven L at Mattress Firm in Costa Mesa made things a breeze.  He greeted me kindly while wearing his mask and maintaining appropriate social distance.  Steven took his time with me as he explained the benefits and differences in each mattress.  I was uncertain what I wanted and Steven guided me to the perfect bed.  The whole experience was a pleasure.  I ended up with a hybrid.  Who knew that would be my choice??!!  There was never any pressure, just a good salesman who knew his products. who helped me find my perfect bed.  Oh!  The store was clean.  I felt safe as I lay on many mattresses.  Because really you need to try a mattress before you make a choice.  I just didn’t feel I could do that online and with Steven L and Mattress Firm I didn’t have to.  Thank you Steven I look forward to many restful nights.  And thank you Mattress Firm for maintaining a storefront where I could test the products and hiring a knowledgeable and professional sales person.<//Review>< username>

First time mattress shopping. Had no idea what to expect. Our salesperson, Spires, greeted us upon entering the store. He was friendly but not overly so...he sounded like he knew what he was talking about. Not pushy and sold us the mattress within our price range. Will definitely recommend in CM's buzz group on FB.< /Review>

i love this place. my roommate and i wish we could live here, but since we can’t, a visit will have to do. Clay is probably the nicest person I have ever met. Great conversation and we picked out a great mattress that works for me and my back issues. I think everyone should get their mattresses here.<//Review>

<Name>Maria LaSusa<//Name><Text>Carl T was outstanding. Despite being in sales, I actively avoid salespeople and was thinking of purchasing a mattress online. On a whim I went to this store and had the pleasure of working with Carl. He is an expert and a professional. I felt safe even during the pandemic as they sanitized all the beds, all the employees practiced social distancing, and wore their masks. Carl helped me find a bed in my budget, took the time to explain my choices clearly, and helped me find the bed of my dreams. I highly recommend this store and Carl who was trustworthy and consultative in guiding me through the process. Also, I was in somewhat of a time crunch and he was efficient in helping me find a mattress. If you want a straightforward, helpful, and knowledgeable salesperson definitely seek out Carl at Mattress Firm!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Clay is the MAN!
Walking out really excited with my purchase, first time ever having to go and look for a bed so i did not know what to really expect or even how much i would be walking out spending . Showed me around the store and different kind of mattress’s got to try some out and see which ones i liked best , also what kind of mattress’s were around my budget . Good guy  very helpful definitely glad i made a stop here and didnt fall into buying a bed at the store i stopped by before coming to Mattress Firm.

Thanks Clay!< /Review>

Ask for Clay. Friendly and professional. I like a softer mattress while my gf likes more firm. Clay took the time to find the best mattress for both of us, he showed us a variety of options at different price points so didn't make us feel pressured. Clay was awesome, thanks for the help, look forward to my new mattress!!<//Review>

My Salesman was named Carl , glad I choose this night to look for a mattress... He was very knowledgeable, polite and professional !! He was able to ask me the right questions and explained the my issue and had me try different mattresses... again he knew his products, Mattress Firm should feel lucky to have a employee like this who took the time and made this shopping experience a great one. I will be telling friends where to purchase a mattress when they need one. Thanks Carl !<//Text>

I needed a Serta mattress delivered asap and got to the Harbor Blvd store CMesa - CA on a Friday night, Sept 11/20, 15 mins before closing, already excusing myself. I was helped by the best salesperson I’ve ever met : Clay ( not sure if this is his correct name. He was excited to help, very knowledgeable about all his products and I don’t have words to explain how satisfied I am with the process. I hope my review gets to the management. An employee like that is a dream of any business... I would ‘steal’ him on the spot if I was a business owner . Plus, I got Z best price for my Serta mattress and it will b delivered within 48 hours of my purchase. The whole process took 15 mins.  TEN stars for mattress firm in every way I could grade them. 20 stars for the young guy that I know will thrive in anything he puts himself into:0) Adriana Leite</review>

Great experience working with Clay at the Costa Mesa store. Didn’t have the mattress protector in store that I needed, so he ordered it for me to pick up in a few days. Clay is knowledgeable about the products and was extremely enjoyable to work with throughout the process. Would definitely recommend seeing Clay at the Mattress Firm store in Costa Mesa for your mattress needs.< /Review>

<text>I have been in the retail automobile business since 1982.  Kristen gave my wife and I an absolutely wonderful experience. She greeted us professionally and with enthusiasm. My wife has a bad back and she guided us towards the correct mattress for her. Very professional very knowledgeable. It was a pleasure doing business with her.  We were going to shop one other store but because of Kristen  we did not. We bought because of her and her alone.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I came here to purchase a box spring for my new apartment. STEVE was such a great help! I was worried about not being able to get it delivered in time, however Steve went above all & worked to get it to me even with such short notice. Definitely recommend Mattress Firm & this Costa Mesa location specifically :) thanks again Steve!!< /Text>

Sonya was really helpful on the phone and in the store. I was looking for the cheapest mattress I could find. Their prices were great! I ended up going for a slightly more expensive mattress after talking with Sonya and it was delivered the next day. Super easy! Thanks for the help Sonya!< /Text>

<review>Sonia was such a helpful and kind person! She helped us find the best quality mattress for our budget and never tried to push us to spend more. With her help we found a great mattress is a perfect fit.
Great place to go. I highly recommend.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Wow! Such an outstanding experience with my sales genius, not sales rep. His name is John Jamison. He was so informative and professional. It’s nice when you walk in to spend hundreds of your hard earned dollars and someone isn’t pushy but wants to help you to find what’s best for you. The bed was for my teen and he spent the time to help explain the different options. I can hardly wait for my son to get his bed because I know I made the best choice. John J, I want you and your company to know that you represent this company well. OUTSTANDING! I might be back soon to get myself a new mattress and wouldn’t go anywhere else nor have another person help in my decision. Thank you!!!</text>< Pictures>

I needed help finding what another Mattress Firm in another state had in stock, and she called them multiple times and walked me through the process. She helped me figure out the best mattress for my budget and followed through after I left - even staying a little late after hours so that I could complete the transaction. Please go see Sonya at this Mattress Firm location!! You won’t be sorry. Honestly, she will make buying a mattress easy and enjoyable.< /Review>< Pictures>

Wow! Words cannot express how enjoyable an experience it was for us to shop for a new mattress. Buying furniture can be so stressful but the employees at Matress firm Costa mesa(Kevin, Shaun and John ) made the experience so pleasant and easy.
We are newlyweds, looking for something special for our new dream home. From the moment we stepped in they made the process smooth, they explained the pros and cons of each,  showed us different models, and only wanted what fit our needs. Never once did we feel that they were being “salesman” or feel haggled/cornered into purchasing.
They walked us through the process and acted like our friends instead of salesmen. And to add to their friendliness at the end they were so willing to work with us on the price. We asked for certain perks, they went above and beyond our expectations. We got an amazing bed for a great deal! If you are thinking of mattress shopping definitely drop by and give them a chance. You will not be disappointed! Best mattress shopping experience in my life! Will recommend to all my friends:)</text>

Sonia Kemp was professional and kind. She went over and above to match a mattress to our needs.  I appreciate her attention to detail and her ability to recognize our needs.  She provided excellent service.  Thank you so much. She deserves recognition for the high level of service she provided.< /review>

I couldn't ask for a better place to go and get a mattress from. All the employees were very knowledgeable and helpful. Thank you John Jamison for helping me to choose the right mattress for my needs.

I have a friend in the Las Vegas store and even though Kristen knew she wasn't getting the sale she went out of her way to help me as if she was getting the sale and the commission. I was very impressed as I had a badexperience in my local store and went a few extra miles so I wouldn't have to go in there again. I was glad I did!!!!
Kristen is an asset to Mattress Firm as a company for sure. By the time we got my friend, who is one of your top sales people in the country, on a video chat Kristen had already helped choose the perfect mattress.
My friend said to Kristen he will hopefully see her in Mexico. If there's a manger reading thIs.....SEND HER 😂.

Very personal and knew everything about mattresses and toppers that I asked about and more. Went in with no expectations of buying anything, but walked out with a foam mattress topper!

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Sonya. She was very kind and patient with me. I really didn't know what I wanted coming in. But she walked me thru the different types of mattresses they had and nicely explained the differences. I finally settled on one. She made the process very quick and easy. She even set up delivery right to my house and having my old mattress removed! Go see Sonya for your mattress needs! You won't regret it!</review>

Just bought our mattress here. Sonya - the store manager/sales lady was very nice and pleasant to work with. She was not pushy like other mattress salespersons and yet we ended up buying instead of just having a look like our original plan. Sonya is very knowledgeable and shows you what works best for your need rather than sells you what is the most expensive thing in the store. And she managed to find me an early delivery slot than what communicated on her website. I had a much better deal vs. buying online.< /Text>

Azita was the sales representative which helped me pick out my mattress. I came in with a lot of questions and she had the right answer for all of them. She took the initiative to ensure I got the perfect mattress. It was clear that she cared about me, not just as a customer, but as another person. Her service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend coming here.< /Text>

< Review>
My fiancé and I recently made a purchase during their Black Friday sale and we couldn’t have been happier with our experience and Sonya was incredibly helpful! She is the manager here and she answered all of our questions, was knowledgeable and went above and beyond for us as my fiancé and I were having a difficult time agreeing with one another on which mattress and for what price. But Sonya broke down everything I needed to know to feel better about the purchase and helped me understand my fiancé’s side of things. We now have our bed (my fiancé won that fight) and I hate to admit it but they were both right! I love our mattress - thank you Sonya & Mattress Firm!<//Review>

<Review>Today was the best form of customer satisfaction I have ever received. After dealing with the stress of not getting our mattress due to stock issues, to deliveries being late, then to finally receiving a totally different mattress (which we hated), after all the phone calls of no one knowing what to do, or not doing anything in that matter, today on 11/12/2018 my girlfriend and I went into Mattress Firm of Costa Mesa and were greeted by Azita in sales, and her manager Jaron Krause. He listened to our troubles, and immediately went to work to turn our unfortunate experiences in to the best we've ever had with any company. Jaron knew the true meaning of customer satisfaction and we'll never forget it, we got a new mattress that we love, and are happy beyond belief. I cannot thank Jaron enough and would recommend him to all my loved ones and everyone I know. He really turned our thoughts about the company around, and there isn't a rating high enough for Jaron, I can promise anyone, If you ask for Jaron Krause you will not regret it, and be as happy as we are! Thank you Jaron, a true professional.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dcdfbe7ac8a8ef:0xd7e587a55c873b6c< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I mainly pick up beer or ice. If I see something on sale that I use I'll pick it up. In a hurry and know the store is not going to be busy I may check for what I need but more not purchase it because the prices are higher than a bigger market.<//Text>

This is one of the most affordable places in this area. You can find a lot of Mexican products at ease and parking is always great.
Cashiers are helpful and always make fast transactions.
However, the restaurant part of the market has a “B” on their Health Department and Sanitation sign. Unfortunately, that’s not a good sign. It could mean a roach and/or rodent infestation was present and that’s a little scary.</review>

The Cashiers will even show you where the product is, if you can't seem to find it. "Of course within reason" if there's not a long line, and if there's a line they call for assistance. I Highly Recommend this Grocery Store.< /review><response>None<//response></record>

<text>Their longaniza was expired, looked black. And the ones that weren't expired, looked dry and old. Produce is poor quality, so is fruit and veggies. Tomatoes have light color, and avocados were black on the inside. There was a time when their pan dulce was great, but it's changed for the worse. Now I just go there for chips when they are on sale.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2d7001ff25f3b:0xfc3359818d75bf37</Gmap_id>< user_id>

Not bad. Some items are less than other stores and some more. I went in for one thing and came out with more than I wanted. Good deal on what time bought.< /Text>

<review>More expensive but convenient for grabbing something quick instead of a large grocery store. Alot of Hispanic stuff you won't find in the larger stores. They also have a small jeweler in the store that sells jewelry and does jewelry repairs. I gave 3 stars only because of their high prices on groceries.<//review>< time>

Quick & easy. Broad but shallow selection of groceries-you'll find what you need but maybe not in your usual brand. Specializes in Latino cooking & foods. Produce is a little sketchy, bruised or over-ripe & only lasts a day or so- I avoid it. But the bakery is great with lots of addictive sweet breads made fresh.  Pricing = cheap for generic essentials,  expensive for luxury or name brand items.</review>

I walked over to the meat section and picked up some chicharrones. There was a piece of chicharrones in the glass casing that had mold on it. I brought it to the attention of one of the meat dept. employees and they simply did not care! I brought it to another employees attention at the cash register and they seem confused. I left my cart full of items there and walked out with nothing. I also sent an email to what appears to be their form of customer contact and never got a response. This kind of carelessness is what gets people sick and creates health risks we don’t need. I will be sending the pictures I took to the health dept.< /text>
