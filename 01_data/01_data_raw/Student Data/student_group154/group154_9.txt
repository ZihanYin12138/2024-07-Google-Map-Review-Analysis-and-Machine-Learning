Definitely not the best place for sure but, it comes with multiple color and style choices and can be super relaxing, and the price is not too bad, the also do eyebrows and massages. The people that work there are super nice and gentle, I bet you'll ha e a good experience. (They do appointments and walk in's) You will not regret it!......that's what I said 2 hours ago, I am now editing and updating, I gave it 5 star originally but over the past two hours my nails and fingers hurt (like sting) because of the way the lady cut them(she was also a bit to rough not gonna lie), I now have ingrown finger nails. Just ask if they can cut them and file a little bit but not on the sides because that's what causes ingrown nails......*aggressively sighs* ok ANOTHER UPDATE! It is a day after and I actually got to look at my fingers closer and realized that I am bleeding to, and that I am not the only one that this has happened to...the lady filed my nails AND fingers. Do not recommend. 2 stars.😤</Text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>I paid a little over $100 the first time for a pedicure and full set. Not a problem, I always pay that much. Within a week my nails started to lift. I went back and expressed my concern about water getting inside. She said it wouldn’t happen but still I told her to do a fill even though I just had the set done. I wanted to make sure they were secure. She charged $30 or so. Four days later my nails start to lift again! Sixth day I have no nails on because the literally popped off. And I got fungus on one possibly two!!!! So upset 😭. The only reason they got two stars is because the pedicure was exceptional.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Good experience while I was there. Clean place, no infection.
I am very displeased that two weeks after service my acrylics with gel polish have become chipped, fallen off, and overall just show the very poor quality. I went to this salon because I had a gift certificate, but I will never be back.
The set is also uneven, it was very unnoticeable at first, but since two have broken and fallen off it is very apparent.</Text>

DO NOT GO HERE! I had been going here for years, but No Longer! The quality of the nail tech's has deteriorated over the years. They do what they want, not what you want done. I called the manager, as a courtesy,  to tell him I actually heard a tech refuse to do what the client wanted 3 times. I also wanted to report the quality going way down. MY LAST 2 PEDICURES WERE AWFUL. The manager hung up on me. I won't be going back.</text>

I sat in the chair for an hour without an offer and this is  not the first time I have come. I noticed it before but thought I may have been wrong. I'm not... but I do not care because tipping for the massage is optional, and I would have tipped well. His loss. The ladies in there...I  tip well because their service is good. The salon is GREAT except that "experience" hurt my heart. It would be better to not offer the service at all than to only offer to some.</Text></record>

They do a good job. My nails looked really good but it's also about the experience. The problem with my visit is that none of the staff (at least that day) spoke English clearly enough to communicate well. They hand you a "menu" and you point to the package you want. They repeat the price of the package. Then while they are doing your treatment they ask 'you want me rub legs', when polishing your nails 'you want flower'. BE WARE, THESE ARE NOT FREE. It was $10 to give my legs a quick rub and $5 for a flower that consisted of 5 dots of white polish. The add ons were an expense I wasn't prepared for.< /review>

<text>DO NOT get pink and whites done here.  I'm new to the area and trying out different places.  I've been getting pink and whites done for over 15 years and this is the first time I stiffed a nail tech. Vicky did a very uneven job with the white acrylic and there are bubbles in it.  When I asked her to even them out she argued with me that they were even.  She attempted to file more 2 times and I still ended up with uneven thickness.  Horrible job especially considering how much they cost.</text></record></dataset><record>

Just moved here and I was so excited a nail place was across the street. I've been 4 times, thinking it would get better… it hasn't. This place shouldn't be considered a spa either. These people are quantity over quality. They rush you in and rush you out. I've left with polish on the sides of my fingers and uneven nails, even after I pointed it out to them. Iv felt I was being talked about a couple times too. Not friendly and they don’t care about you or your nails, just your money. Worst nail place I have ever been too. Wish I never wasted my money and time.</review>

They have a sign saying that you get a free neck and shoulder massage. But none were offered to me the last several times. This last manicure, I got cut and was bleeding! It is very difficult communicating with the technicians.</Text>

Do not go here!!
I contracted a nail fungus from one of the techs who admitted to me that she has a fungus after my second or third visit to her. Obviously she is the one I got it from.
I didn't even know that a good establishment will not work on anyone with a fungus. She should not even be working there. And there was no sterilization of tools, or throwing away of used emery boards or buffers. Just saving it all to use again on some other unsuspecting victim.
Now I'm trying to get rid of the fungus before I hopefully find a new place with better sanitation rules.</Text>

Terrible experience- the woman who did my nails was rushing the entire time and didn’t prioritize me, she was rough on my hands and left me at the table to go do something else then came back several minutes later. She forgot to file 3 of my nails and she CUT me twice while nipping my cuticles, she only took about 10 mins to do both my hands. I literally picked up the file and finished filing my own nails when she wasn’t looking. Her paint job was horrible and I redid them after she was done. Didn’t even give me a hand massage either. Never going back. WASTE of money and time.<//text>

I have been going to this salon for a very long time since it is close to my house and convenient. Unfortunately, I will no longer be going here. The past few times I have gone here to get my nails done/filled, the workers have been astonishingly rude. One time, I chose a nail color that ended up being way too light and see through so I asked the man doing my nails for a different color, he obliged, but huffed and puffed the whole time and talked crap about me to the other girls nearby (it was obvious).
Another time, a different man was taking off old acrylic nails (that I had gotten done there) and completely destroyed my real nails, not to mention cut me multiple times in the process. When I told him he was hurting me, he rolled his eyes and made a comment about how it shouldn't take this long to remove acrylic and I was being a "baby". NO, you just cut me and ripped off my real nails down to where they are not supposed to be! I had to wear bandaids for a few days because they skin under my nails was exposed. (Also, somehow they're price for gel acrylic is the same for a gel manicure...??? At least that's what they charged me for last time I went)
When you walk in, sometimes no one even bothers to acknowledge you. You just stand there like an idiot for a few minutes before someone asks what you want. Altogether, this place is unfriendly with a lack of professionalism. I will take my money elsewhere, thank you very much!< /Text>

The first lady who attended me left my fingers in a lot of pain because the fake nails were put completely wrong. When I tried to complain she ignored me so I had to call in a couple minutes after leaving . I was told to return another day and when I did another lady then who helped me did a good job at fixing them. I got a coupon for $10 which I used to remove them a few weeks later and another lady (who seemed to be mad that she had to attend me) who attended me hurt my fingers really bad (ripped all nails off) I left home with throbbing fingers. I had told her that it hurt but she didn’t care and continued to rip them off, some of my nails ripped. My nails are still repairing 😒</review>

<Name>rosaura pagan cardona</Name><Review>Worst place ever, the staff was way too rude and the service was really poor in quality. I went to get my fingernails fill and my fingertips were all scratched and the nails fell off a week late. And the girl who did my fill kept offering me a gel manicure, a pedicure, and wax. She insisted to the point were I just wanted her to finish my nails so I would run away from there. And another thing is that they keep talking trash about the clients in your own face, sometimes in english and you don't have to know their language to know they are talking crap about you and laughing on your face.< /Review><Rate>1<//Rate></record>

I was referred to them from a close friend. I don’t regret making the phone call. I received a quote very quickly, my agent (Ana) was also very knowledgeable in explaining and answering my questions thoroughly. I will definitely refer anyone I know in need of insurance to the ECI team!</text>

I was in need of a "ghost policy" for a roofing company and COULD NOT find anyone who would help me. It's not an easy policy to place and no one seemed interested in helping me. I did some Internet research and made a call to ECI and fortunately, got Katie Sanders on the phone. She was personable, knowledgeable, and efficient. She got me the policy I needed lickity splity! I really enjoyed dealing with her and look forward to dealing with her again.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Luis Ponce is our account rep for Workman's Comp Insurance.  He started working with me when I knew nothing about contracting with State Fund, and has been a wealth of information, how to, and keeping us informed of special programs. He is our "go to" person for all of our Workman's Comp insurance questions.  He recently made us aware of a program that could help our little company with a little bit of reimbursement of CoVid compliance costs.  We never would have know about the program if he hadn't kept us updated.  We feel fortunate that we were able to get the paperwork in on time, and receive a small reimbursement stipend.  As a small company, every little bit helps.  I can't recommend using this company for your Workman's Comp insurance needs more.</review>< Pictures>

We have been working with Employers Choice for about three years now for workers comp, general liability, commercial auto, and our contractor’s bond.  All of our small business insurance needs are met with promptness and excellent advice.   I have been specifically working with Fay for some time now and I’m happy to say that all of my calls and emails are answered right away and with direct action on her part.   She is knowledgeable about the market, and communicates with me proactively about my policies.   I’m very pleased with the partnership that we have.< /text>

We needed to get Workers Comp insurance to protect our staff and stay in compliance with California law.  We were terrified; however, Fay and her team has been awesome and she has held our hand from day one and is always available to answer out questions and make this process simple. We love Employers Choice Insurance and we are glad to have found Fay.  She and her team are the best!<//text>

I recently acquired my new Work comp policy for 2020. It was quick and easy process online and the policy and certificate were provided within an hour. I spoke with Luke briefly to go over some details and I  like that he knows my business and activities, and is proactive with the right information to ensure that we’re getting the right coverage<//Review>

Fay Schwartz over at Employers Choice is a wonder to work with. I work in the fast paced area of film production and she was faster than I was at getting things moving along which was beyond helpful! From a customer service point of view it has been an amazing experience from start to finish.</text>

I like Employers Choice and my experience with them was always positive. I feel  safe working with them and always proud to introduce them in front of my clients. Fay Schwartz is my agent for two years now, she is very knowledgeable and was always very responsive and responsible.
I have nothing bad  to say about them.
Thank you Employers Choice!</text>

Katie’s service was on point. Stayed with me for 8 months while all my paperwork was going through. One of those experiences that end up with a number in your phone under “Insurance Guy”. Sorry Katie, I know your not a guy!!! Really great service. Ask for Katie!!<//review>

<Review>I handle the office management for the company I work for and we have been using Employers Choice Insurance for a couple years now.  I have been working directly with Fay Schwartz for practically the entire time.  Fay is great!!  As our company has been growing, Fay has been able to answer my questions and get the best information and services that we have needed in order to be compliant and cost-efficient as well.  I look forward to many years of working together.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Well, you don't expect insurance to be easy, right? I've got a very weird business model, and had trouble getting other insurance for it, so I was prepared to wade through a bunch of red tape. Nope. A couple phone calls and emails later, and it's all done. Nice.<//review>< pictures>

Katie is excellent at explaining things throughly. She gets back to you in a timely manner and she is very kind and a great Sales person who cares. I have been in Sales for 20 years with high end retirement communities and I know a good one from a bad one. She deserves a promotion. I am not easily impressed!!<//Review>

Has grown fast and big around it, still, it stands and is convenient  for locals to walk and take out foods from Mexican style restaurant..< /Review>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>As an employee, I still highly recommend MLG for harm resulting from auto defects. Jonathan Michaels is the firm's principal, and he takes seriously both being the number 1 auto defect form in the U.S., and taking care of the team at MLG so that we're all on-board with anything this goal. All this means that you'll get great representation that is responsive to your needs, and aggressive in dealing with our auto-manufacturer opponents.< /review>< Pics>

My experiences with MLG and Jonathan Michaels have always been incredibly positive. The entire staff is responsive and attentive. Jonathan Michaels is driven, passionate and tenacious about his craft and it shows. He's articulate without being arrogant, confident without being condescending. Anyone who's worked with attorneys knows this is rare.</Text>

I can't thank MLG automotive enough for all they did for me and my family.
Attorney Jonathan Michaels is the most diligent and honorable attorney I've ever had a pleasure of doing business with.

He is personable, to the point, accurate and always available to take your call. My experience was smooth from start to finish. They were knowledgeable, timely and took the time to listen.

I highly recommend MLG Automotive!< /Review>

Jonathan Michaels is a fighter for his clients, and he does the fighting intelligently and thoughtfully.  Having been around so many attorneys in my life, it is refreshing to see how excellent Jonathan works.  A true professional that gets results.  I highly recommend MLG!!!</Review>

Having reported for many years and listening to numerous attorneys present their cases, Jonathan Michaels and the MLG team stand out as not only experts in the field of automotive law, but as compassionate professionals who get amazing results for their clients. I would highly recommend Jonathan and his team at MLG!< /review>

<review>I have worked with MLG founder Jonathan Michaels a few times over the years, and I continue to be impressed with his legal insight and his ability to think "outside the box" for a solution.  I consulted with him on a complex family law/probate case recently, and his well-informed ideas were very beneficial to the ultimate resolution of the case.  His entire law office is extremely professional and attentive to detail; I have personally heard an LA Superior Court judge compliment Mr. Michaels on his professionalism in court.  I unequivocally endorse Jonathan as a top-notch attorney.<//review><user>100925761684711264478< /user>< Pics>

My family had a case with General Motors. Met with several attorneys in Orange County and Los Angeles.  We all
(my mother and father and my skeptical brother) felt Mr. Michael's and his staff were the most efficient, honest, detailed oriented and attentive attorneys we had ever met.  He gave it to us 'straight' with no lawyer double speak.  He laid everything out for us in a very precise way and told us how long it would take.  Sure enough, he was 100% correct on...everything he said.  We received a settlement that we never even dreamed could happen to us.  Jonathan Michael's and his staff are amazing.  If we could give them a higher star we would!<//Text>

Jonathan Michaels and his staff are pleasant folks but unless litigation is involved don't count on much help. I naively expected them to do what was in my best interest; it didn't work that way. They were only interested in filing a lawsuit against a Porsche poacher; not getting my car back from the authorities who impounded it for an unreasonable amount of time. I took matters into my own hands and accomplished what MLG Automotive Law wouldn't do. My own research, data collecting, and communication with authorities far surpassed their efforts. However I do give them A+++ for ongoing billing. They are very good at that.

My collector car is back in my possession no thanks to them. And yes, I gave Mr. Michaels ample opportunity to reconcile my grievances prior to posting this review.

I wish them the best of success but hope they start practicing law understanding that not everyone is interested in suing somebody.<//Text>

Phenomenal service & Great had a good price.  From the moment we walked in the sales team was there to help us figure out the right couch for us. They definitely did.

We decided on the”49ers” Couch Which although it seems too big for an apartment it has been Perfect for us. I love the modular design and ability to move pieces around if necessary. That is also nice to have a couch that can double as a bad from time to time when guest come.

I definitely appreciate Jason and his professionalism.  I can’t imagine life without our big comfy couch and I’m happy to have some thing during durable enough to deal with our busy lifestyle.

The parts they are using are very cheap, does not cover warranty as well. If it is broken even by a single person use, they will try to convince u that u r responsible for that instead of accepting quality issue. Very disappointed,will not buy anything from here further and also will not recommend anybody to buy from here .</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808fc990281f4469:0xc60b6cecce2e33b9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>After having a big disappointment with the horrible costumer service Ashley furniture provided to me and my wife. We’d decided to go shopping around other furniture stores in the Bay Area. After searching multiple stores we ended up here. Not only the service provided by Tony was amazing we were able to find the sectional we were looking for cheaper than Ashley and it was delivered in a timely manner and to top  it off I received a military discount.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>Staffs are really helpful. Make sure they delivered the right furnitures. It took a while to deliver the furnitures because of this COViD.

Just purchased a new sofa set from Anthony and he was amazing. Gave us a great deal on some couches and a new mattress. Delivered them for free and included some nice decorative pillows at no charge. Highly recommend this store. Thanks again for all the help and the excellent deal Anthony. We will be back to buy more furniture from.you in the near future.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>We had been thinking about the style of sofa we wanted to get for months and finally randomly decided to stop by furniture discounters near by and we were determined to bring a couch home. We walked around and checked out all the sofas for about half an hour and Anthony came to answer questions we had after browsing. After learning about suspension vs coils and different fabrics, we settled on a love seat, but it would have taken 9 weeks to ship since it had to be made of of North Carolina. The floor model was in great condition, Anthony worked something out for us, and he arranged to have it shipped that same night. It was cleaned, wrapped, and delivered within an hour of us leaving the store. We are so happy with this purchase, it looks great in the office. He made furniture shopping so painless and that's so much appreciated.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I also had the pleasure of working with Jason on my second visit. Likewise he was professional.

Just now after purchasing my moms twin set 3 months ago their willingness to exchange the box to a low one, waiving any fees associated including delivery was a shock factor. I was prepared to pay any fees as it was my fault for not saying something after the high box was delivered. That was very generous of them to do that for my mom.

Again furniture discounters is the way to go when you plan on furnishing your home. They're willingness to work with you to have a good experience overall is a plus!<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Very poor quality furniture made to look like high quality. They start creaking a few months after you buy them. The delivery people look like thugs and are very rude.

We were sold furniture by a salesman called Jason who’s your typical sleazy sales guy. There’s a reason this store is deserted anytime you walk in. Stay away.< /Text>

<Review>Very  unfriendly staff. Right when we entered he asked what r we there for, took us to that particular section, showed 3-4 sofas and said, have u finalised anything?  We told him that we will look around and let him know. But his attitude was that either we pick something or leave. No wonder, we were the only people in the store. The whole parking was empty and there was just one car besides ours. Won't go back and don't recommend anyone either.< /Review><rating>1< /rating><Time>1582520616667</Time><GmapID>0x808fc990281f4469:0xc60b6cecce2e33b9< /GmapID>< Resp>

This place has nice collection with reasonable price! Look for the offers on major holidays & the price will beat most of the furniture stores around! Delivery is free for nearby locations and best thing is the service which I was happily surprised! I bought a expandable table and chair set 5 months back! Somehow the table stopped functioning.. repair service was arranged over email! They were very prompt to respond! Repair guys fixed it temporarily but offered free replace! Can’t ask for anything more! Happy returning customer!< /text>

Man, this place has got the goods.  The showroom is ginormous.  I've never seen so many different types of sofa, dining tables, coffee tables, etc.  The prices are also pretty reasonable for the quality.  We went to a bunch of different places in the Peninsula and the City and Furniture Discounters was the one place that had the styles + prices we were looking for.  We bought a bed, dresser, dining room table + chairs and all of the pieces have held up very nicely.  I'm not an expert on furniture, but I can tell you that the stuff we got was HEAVY (we've re-arranged a few times), and I generally think heavy a good thing when it comes to furniture.

The salespeople are very nice too.  Helpful, but not pushy.  They're not on commission (at least that's what they say), and it shows.  None of this jockeying for customers that you see at places where the salespeople are on commission.

Definitely check them out.< /Text>

I have purchased numerous pieces of furniture from here over the years.  The service has always been very good .  They are not pushy, rather they will make solid recommendations.
I'll continue to shop here and recommend them to my friends.<//Review>

If i only i could give them zero stars!
We spent thousands of dollars on this sectional Italian leather sofa that shifts apart everytime we sit on it. We had them come out 4 times to half ass fix it. The delivery people are shady and questionable too. Potential buyers beware of shopping or buying here! They will pretend to be helpful and nice to make the sale, but talk about you in Chinese the min you pay they are crappy! Do your research people and stay away. Once they have your money after selling you fake defective products you're screwed! I wish i took my time and went with all the warning signs!< /Review>< Pictures>

This place has very nice collections of furnitures, living room items, bedroom items and dining tables and chairs. The price ranges also vary starting from $200 to thousands depending on your need. This is big warehouse which has lot of options available for all different items available in the store.<//text>

I spent over $2k on a chaise & sofa. I was told it will take 6 wks for them to make the color i chose.
I put down $700. to secure & 2 wks i came back to pay in cash $1500
These are supposed to be high ends quality!
My furniture arrived ( 9/25/17)  the following wk. too soon w bad quality. They rushed the making. Therefore I have bad quality on both sofas. The chaise have one slanted leg & the sofa's left armrest is slanted in.
As soon as I seen this I showed the delivery guys, but rushed out asap!
Right away I called & sent pictures to the person who i dealt w and now I feel they are neglecting me.
Nice look but poor quality!!!
Too much of my money was put to waste!!!<//Review>

Arrogant sales person I met. I guess he is main guy there. As some other people mentioned prices are same as living space or Ashley. Nothing discounted here. When i was talking about price negotiation he just mentioned this what it is and walked away. I had same experience twice with this store and same guy. Never returning here.<//Review>

<text>Just came back from visiting this place. The sales person was slightly arrogant and did not listen to what I was looking for, but was intentionally attempting to push a sale of an item that I clearly stated “I am not interested in”. The price was above expected and definitely too high for the name of the store.
I can find the same furniture at a lower price elsewhere and have it delivered. The quality and the price did not match. Quality of furniture is too low for the asked price. Will not visit here again.<//text><pics>None<//pics><rate>1< /rate><response>None< /response>< Date>

Wide selection, but not what we were looking for. The strikes are diverse and pretty hot or miss. Got harassed for taking photos to keep track of what we might want to buy. Would not go back.</Text>

My wife and I went there 2 weeks ago and was told they will match the price on any furniture. When we went back the following weekend to speak with the same salesperson he promptly increased the price on the table and said, "Well, you should have bought it last week." I highly discourage consumers from doing business there. Thanks for being a douche bag Vincent.</text>

Friendly customer service here. My husband and I went shopped around for a new couch in the area. We visited other stores but this one had the largest selection. We ended up buying a black sofa and loveseat that was $150 cheaper than ACO. The sales people do not pressure you to buy which was a big plus. They had really cheap delivery and set up was included. I would definitely come back here to buy more furniture.<//review>

There's another passage way to the second showroom, which has a lot more low price point items.\n\nWe have sofas starting at $349, queen beds starting at $199, and $99 nightstands. We are a discount store, relative to our name brand competitors.\n\nIf you ever get a chance to come back, the second showroom can be found by walking to the back.

<review>I loved this bar from the moment I walked in. The layout and the art is amazing. Just walking around inside is a trip. Go around the corner to find yourself a great place to hang outside. Drinks were good. Service at the bar and the door was really friendly. Really good music. I loved my first experience here. I shall come back one day.

<rate>5< /rate><review>The first time I went to The Association was for one of their drink class. I initially took the gin class and I loved it. I love the vibe. Small and cozy and amazing drinks. My fave: The Last Word. Must have.

The Association was pretty cool. They had a nice vibe, the interior was dope and I liked that they had separate areas. My friends got food and they seemed to enjoy it. I simply ordered a beer that I liked, so it was hard for them to mess that up. The only complaint I had was that a member of the waitstaff clearly favored a regular over me. Which, if I was a regular, I'd love. However, I'm not; so, the chatting was a little irritating. Especially, as it was relatively busy. This didn't ruin my experience, however. And, I would still come back again.<//text>

<review>Place has amazing live music. It gets a crowded but not to the point where the bartender can't see you.
Drinks are amazing. I forgot the name of the drink but it had the tajin salt and tequila. It was the bomb.
The band that was playing was called La Victoria. They were awesome!< /review>< Response>

'Sigh' how I wish this place was in New Jersey. Can I put a request in? I absolutely love it here. Been here twice now and they never disappoint. The drinks are on point always, the service amazing and the music and vibe is the best. So the first time I came I had the fried pickles which I loved and don't know how they could ever remove that from the menu. And they had a lot more food options that I liked before that was more New Orleans esque?.. this time around the menu was more simple and I fought between what I wanted to try. Either way the food was great.  Looking forward for my next visit here.< /text>

Quaint, cute, & cozy. Was looking for a place for a place to take a few friends out for a drink & this place was perfect. Reasonably price & chill. Only downfall is you have to go to the bar and get drinks bc there's no waitress. Went on a Thursday & bar wasn't too busy so it was fine.</Review>

The plantains were sweet and perfectly fried.  West African food is my new favorite.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Hidden gem on the second floor. It's hard to see this place from the street. The artwork is really interesting. The space is huge. The drinks are fun and pretty good. The bar food here is decent. The cauliflower was really good. The chicken nuggets were ok, and the Arancini balls were a bit spicier than expected.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Guvenne Waerna<//username><resp>None< /resp><user_id>108716937507854698258</user_id></record>

Crafted cocktails with awesome views and laid back ambiance. Ive been here weekends and weekdays and cant complain theres usually plenty of seats to have a cocktail and catch up. I havent tried the food but the menu sounds appetizing.<//Text>

The Association  is definitely a go-to spot for anyone living or visiting SF.  It is an oasis in the middle of the city, and has the beauty of science to show for it.  The music, drinks, food, and exhibits are super interesting.   My favorite was the jungle exhibit and the underwater/underground fishtanks!</text>

This place is LIT AF! Music is on point, you'll be singing along all night like we were :) this venue is very aesthetically pleasing with the different charicature-like walls, definitely lots of fun for selfies and group pics (and boomerangs!) their signature cocktails are also very good! The black dahlia was definitely my fav (vodka) and also very pretty. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a great night out in LA< /Review>

Awesome bar. Great ambiance. The Desperado is a must order. Mescal with carpano and some other delish mix. When you order use the code "Third Floor" for the LA Special.<//review>

<text>This lounge is LIVE. I personally enjoy intimate atmospheres, and The Association definitely gives you that! Bartenders were nice, a fairly large amount of people show up (I went on a Thursday), and the DJ played great choices (mostly Hip Hop and R&B which I enjoy). I would definitely go back on my next trip to LA!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c6357a71e59b:0xb2930b6a7cb869f8</GmapID></record>

<review>Very good drinks, they use veryyy cheap alcohol. Giving 5 stars because atmosphere is great and they do have great service. Bartenders are super considerate when you have not clue what you want, I loved every single drink but next time just specify what brand of liquor you’d like them to use. Because they will use just the flavored cheap liquor that tastes amazing but makes you feel like #*% later.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c6357a71e59b:0xb2930b6a7cb869f8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This location is definitely where I like to start my nights when I go out in DTLA. Their drinks are on the pricier side, but what do you expect from a nice place that creates AMAZING cocktails! The inside is dark, and has a cool feel to it. Later in the night, they have a DJ and this small little area at the end of the bar becomes this super fun dance section. ALSO, they have cocktail making classes for only $20!!  Check out their website and click on the "Class by Association" tab for more info!</Review>< Date>

The Association can be a hard place to find for a person who has not been there. It is right next door to Cole's, you can't miss it, it is the only place with a lion door knocker. The Association has some fine crafted cocktails. They use quality spirits and fresh ingredients, it is evident in the taste. They have a great happy hour. Make sure you pay this place a visit.

Great bar, ambiance and crowd. Skimpy on the drinks though. A least 3/4 the size of most places. Adding ice makes them even skimpier. If your drinks were a little bigger I'd give you 5 stars.< /review>

I've been to some dark bars before but this place is like really dark. Can't see two feet in front of you almost. The place is small and the atmosphere is okay. Drinks cost what they're gonna cost (not cheap). Service was decent but definitely could have been better. Good music though. Wouldn't say I would recommend because there are plenty of bars around downtown but wouldn't deter anyone from going there either.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c6357a71e59b:0xb2930b6a7cb869f8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Small cocktail bar located in Los Angeles. The layout of The Association gives off an intimate vibe which includes quite a few places to sit. Unfortunately the amount of people and volume of music don't allow for an intimate night. I wouldn't mind loud music, but there isn't any space to dance, so everyone is standing yelling at each other just trying to talk.

There is this one bartender who is hands down amazing. This guy could multitask 5-6 things at any given time, all with efficiency and quality. He has some kind of memory because he took a ton of orders from different people without needing a single reminder. He was also multitasking quite a few other things. This is more of a witness for yourself type thing. It's a tangent kind of, but I was blown away.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c6357a71e59b:0xb2930b6a7cb869f8<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I would like to propose a toast: to the best cocktail bar in Downtown Los Angeles.

The nondescript entrance whose only demarcation is a lion door knocker gives this bar a members-only private club feel.  But, the symbolism of the brass lion is not one of isolation and exclusivity, rather of power and strength - like the cocktails they pour.

The interior is dark.  With the limited sense of sight, come the heightened senses of smell and taste - making you acutely aware that what you are drinking is a perfectly balanced cocktail, one made with the freshest of ingredients and quality of spirits.

The Association is where I fell in love with 99 year old New Yorker - The French 75, part gin, part champagne.  They just don't make them like they use to and no one makes it like The Association.

May they continue to pour balanced.</review><UserId.>104636687373132435944< /UserId.>< pictures>

<review>Searching for the perfect Whiskey Sour, the bartender here stepped up to the challenge and delivered. Didn't catch his name but he's tatted if that helps. And the reason I bring that up is because about 2 weeks ago, we crawled into this same place, a girl friend and I, to a bartender with no tats, who left us seated for roughly 10 minutes without a single word. You might think that the bar was full and he was running back and forth trying to get to everyone... not the case. He was entertaining a small group of people without an urgency in the world. In any case, the bartender from last night, with the tats, he was great. The door guy was dope too, joked around with the guy and ended up buying my date and I drinks. Probably because of my date haha.</review>< Pictures>

Went on New Year's Eve to celebrate and everything was going fine until toward the end I had to use the bathroom and a fight broke out there were 4 girls that started to fight! and I was standing there innocent bystander and I got socked in the face. Wish I could get all my money back. Stupid ass ratchet ass hoes! Bad experience for the first time being there.</review>

Went here last week on a Saturday night. The bar was okay there were people inside not to crowded either, the reason I am giving the review 2 (two) stars is because within the first 20 minutes of my arrival I was asked to step outside and got kicked out indefinitely. I went to the bar with a group of 15-20 people as we sat in the reserve section I was sitting down enjoying the music drinking on a cup of water as I was the DD unfortunately. I was asked by the "bouncer" which his name was Tim to step outside because I was intoxicated? Really? I was in there for 20 minutes minding my own business and he kicks me out. After a 5 minutes discussion with Tim he claims I was sleeping? I don't know what was going on with their staff or they were just having a bad night, but I had to take a cab home and leave the party. Poor operations poorly run.< /review>

The Low-Down=-- Friday Night, No Cover, Poppin, Dark!

Rolled into The Association on a Friday Night and this place is packed, but fortunately there was not a line at the door. The entrance is unmarked and the bar is unlabeled, but know that the entrance to this place is a big solid door and shares the same depressed stairways as Cole's.

Inside was pretty poppin, but this place could be the darkest bar I've ever been in. So dark that your hand would disappear if you stretch it out in front of you. Regardless, there was a crowded cushy seating area which took up about half this place, and the other half would be a standing room that surrounded the single bar. It wasn't dancy, booty-bass music that was playing, and it wasn't too loud either, because I could remember having conversations, and actually remembering what I heard.

Once I made it through the crowd to the bar, it was not long before I was helped, so big plus for that. The bartenders paid a lot of attention to their drinks, but the price also reflected with an average of 11 to 12 bucks per drink. I tried the New York Sour, and it was not too shabby with plenty of stiffness. There were other specialty drinks that I'd probably have to try here.</review>

Saturday Night Review

10pm-No line,11pm-Line-----Good thing the door man remembered me from earlier and let me skip right into the place, yay! It pays to be a girl sometimes, right ladies?!  The location is a little hard to find if you've never been there; it's on 6th street, just east of Main on the south side. Make sense??? *laughs* Just look for the depressed stairways!

Be warn, this place is daaark! I couldn't even see anything when I first stepped in. It took me about a good 5 minutes before my eyes adjusted.  The place was packed with a diverse crowds and electro music popping in the background. The place is small, but it has plenty of seating for ladies with weary feet. They have a long bar with about 3-4 bartenders working that night....Matthew was my bartender for the night and he made my drinks quite stiff in a good way! Although he picked on me, I really liked him cause he reminded me of an old crush that did the same thing. Plus, he made my drinks extra delicious!

Tonight, I tried the Pisco Sour (Pisco, lime juice, simple syrup, & 1 egg white with a dash of bitter.) and the Indian Summer. Both were delicious! I love any drinks with egg white as part of the ingredients because it gives an extra frothiness. Get it if you're a fan like me! If you want something refreshing that's similar to your favorite liquor with soda, get the Indian Summer! It was light and tasty with a hint of grapefruit in it. The only downfall is that the Indian Summer is so easy to drink that it'll go as fast as your water, except you'll be super buzz!

Can't wait to come back for their Happy Hour! (Mon-Fri 5pm-10pm with their specialty drinks for $5)</text>

<text>Ann rocks. She always does a great job cleaning my teeth. It is my fault for not making her job easier. Because I get lazy with not doing the water pick enough.

The services don't come cheap, though, so consider having dental insurance or their VIP program to help manage the bills.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I have been going to Surf City Dentist office for many years.  The office is always clean, and everyone here are nice.

The Dental Hygienist Joni is so caring. She makes sure that I feel comfortable during the cleaning procedure. She did such a wonderful  cleaning job on my teeth, and I feel really happy after she's done.

Doctor Coleman is professional, and easy to talk too. I feel very fortunate that I have Doctor Coleman as my Dentist.<//Review>

< Review>
I came in on Saturday for a teeth cleaning with Kim.  She was so great and for the first time I didn't  have to carry on a conversation about my personal life or the techs personal life  like I have had to with other hygienists.   It was wonderful, I just sat back in the chair, closed my eyes and listened to the music playing.  The only time she spoke was to direct me what to do.  She did ask how I was and complemented me on my necklace but that was about it.  I have never understood a need to converse when someone has their hands in my mouth, in addition I find these conversations mundane and tedious.  Sorry, I guess I'm not the norm but I really loved being quite while getting my teeth cleaned.  She did a great job!!  I really like her!< /Review>

<name>Mary Gangitano< /name><rating>5< /rating><review>I have been afraid of going to the dentist since COVID hit the town! I finally decided my cleaning was long overdue when I received a call there was an appointment open the following morning. I jumped on it thinking that if I thought about it too much I would postpone again. Visiting the office was wonderful. They have measures in place to keep the patient and the staff healthy. Some of the procedures were modified to prevent exposure, my hygienist and Dr Coleman was completely masked and gloved and shielded, my temperature taken and questions were asked before I was even able to enter the office. Was a great experience knowing these times are rough for people my age.</review>< Date>

I neglected my teeth for several years, and my fears were reinforced after being berated by another dentist during a root canal. After breaking a tooth, Surf City Dentist got me in right away and treated me in such a helpful and non-judgmental way. I really appreciate Dr Coleman and the staff for the treatment of my tooth and their courtesy!<//review>

Dr. Yabuki is an artist. I chipped a front tooth and he fixed it flawlessly. No need for a crown. The office is spotless. His staff is helpful and courteous. They take all precautions to protect patients during these trying COVID-19 times. I don't usually leave reviews, but this office and staff deserve 10 stars.</text>

I have been most fortunate to have Dr. Yabuki as my primary dentist for over 15 year s. Dr. Yabuki was recommended by my hygienist when my former dentist made the decision to retire. Dr. Yabuki takes care of my husband and I . In fact, I was just called in by the office staff because Dr. Yabuki had a concern about the last dental x-rays that were taken a couple of weeks ago and wanted to ensure that there were no problems. The entire staff is fabulous from the office personnel to the dental assistants and hygienists.  I would highly recommend this dental office for everyone reading this review!!<//text>

<text>As you look at my records you'll see I've been coming here
over 30 years.  It started with my tennis partner, Lloyd Singer,
who owned it a long time ago.
If I didn't still appreciate you all, I would not be coming.
I especially like the gal who always starts with me.  My senior
mind is bad at remembering names, but I think it's Cindy.
And yes I totally would recommend you to others if they asked
for a good dental office.

These below are comments I forgot to put in the original
response this morning.
I truly appreciate you giving me a tooth brush.  It has always
helped me and when I need a new one, I take the one you
gave me to make sure I get one like it.

My hygienist, Yonni, is awesome!  Dr. Coleman is friendly and professional.  What I like about this office is their priority for the health of my teeth, not to up-sell me on cosmetic procedures.

I am Dentist-phobic!!  I have rarely had a good experience with dentist’s offices.  But I love these people!!  I been once to see a dentist and once for cleaning.  Best part...I still like them!!  I would highly recommend them to anyone who has had bad experiences.  I could write an essay on all the little things they did to make it easy for me!  I would give them 10 stars!  Ann, the woman who cleaned my teeth was so amazing!< /Review>

I’ve been going to this office for many years and I love the staff. However when I was checking out yesterday I was told I owed $$ for my cleaning. I replied I’m a VIP member . The response was , “ oh, I didn’t look “. Not on top of it this time !</Review>

Excellent care from Surf City Dentist.  Friendliness, timely service, informative... to say the last, Dr. Yabuki and his team, who are well trained experts deliver nothing short of peace of mind and quality results.

Thank you for all that you do.  I definitely would recommend your service to anyone.<//Text>

Thank goodness no cavities.
After long period of medical issues...
My teeth needed a major cleaning. I should have brought my garage tool sander to help. Debbie was patient with all my whining and discomfort with all that needed done. I’ll be returning again for 2nd cleaning to finish the job.
I missed having Linda, but needed to get in right away.
The entire office staff is always personal and helpful to get the job done.</text>

Dr. Yabuki and his staff are the absolute best. The doctor is a perfectionist who wants everything to be the best it can be. The hygienists are thorough yet gentle, and more patient than the average saint. One son, who was highly anxious and freaked out by changes and any pain, spent his first appointment just getting used to the chair. Next time, he got to play with the tools, and the following, Ann just looked around his mouth. At the end of his second year, he got his teeth cleaned for the first time, and it was a calm event.

They are not in-network for some insurance plans (but have their own if you don't), but if they are an option for you, choose them!</review>

Amazing!! The people that work here are so nice! Dr. Kabuki is fantastic, and his staff is awesome! I seriously mean that, the staff was so incredible and professional. Crystal, Cora and another super awesome person helped me and honestly when I left there I was super happy. If you are nervous or have had bad experiences in the past this is THE dentist to come to.< /Review>

< Review>
We have been a patient of Dr. Yabuki for about 5 years. I had my 6 month cleaning today and as usual it went great! Never any discomfort, in fact I could almost fall asleep. Cindy is so careful I think of it as if it were a spa beauty treatment. I met the new dentist,  Dr. Coleman. He has been treating my husband when he cracked a molar on a Saturday ! It's good to know that when you have problems during non-office hours that you can get the help you need. My husband and I are so glad we found Surf City Dentist.< /Review>

Thank you so much Surf City Dental for being there when I really needed you!  That’s what I call #1Customer Service!!

Thank you Dr. Coleman and the Surf City Dentist Team! My "onlay" (from a previous dentist) fell out this week and within an hour I was in Dr. Coleman's chair getting it repaired. When we moved to SC Dentist earlier this year, I had no idea how wonderful the doctors and everyone in the office would be for a relative newcomer in distress! I am so grateful for the expertise (the tooth and fit of the onlay feels better than ever) and the friendly and helpful staff that squeezed me into a full calendar. Thank you for saving my week!<//Review>

< review>
Been coming to Dr. Yabuki for years & now I bring my son when he needs work. Had a tooth break today & Dr. Yabuki was booked solid so... I met with Dr. Coleman for the 1st time today and even though it was under undesirable circumstances (who wants to break a front tooth?), he made a wonderful 1st impression on me. Not only did he squeeze me, in he personally referred me to a dentist that accepts Medi-Cal for all the work needed that wouldn't be visible when I smile (that's the work I have Yabuki do because he's so gosh-darn good at it). But unfortunately there was nothing that could be done today but they still tried God bless them.</review>

< review>
My name is Dr Gene Allen and I am a general dentist in Wisconsin.  When my brother-in-law in CA broke his tooth, I knew I wanted to send him to another “tooth conserving “ dentist like myself.  Drs Coleman and Yabuki are active in the Biomimetic community and I know them from attending the same courses. When a crown would have been diagnosed by most dentists, Dr Coleman was able to put into practice the concepts of Biomimetic dentistry to conserve the tooth structure and save the tooth with a much more conservative filling. My brother-in-law is very happy with the promptness with which he was scheduled, the treatment received and the fact ha also saved money and (more importantly),his own natural tooth structure. He experienced no pain during or after the procedure. If I have anyone in the future that needs a dentist in Southern California, I will most certainly will be referring them to Drs Coleman and Yabuki. They are by far the most qualified “tooth conserving” Biomimetic dentists 🦷 in the area! 👍 Dr Gene Allen.< /review>

<review>I was seen by Jovi for a routine teeth cleaning & had annual x-rays taken & when Dr. Ken Yabuki did my exam he noticed a cavity on my x-ray & then confirmed it with his visual examination. I was unaware of this cavity since it was still small enough still to be asymptomatic. Dr. Yabuki scheduled me to fix my dental work within 2 weeks. When I arrived I called the office from the parking lot & was called right on schedule to come up to the office where I was screened for temperature prior to entering the office & then given hand sanitizer immediately upon entering the office. All staff & patient's were wearing masks & I was escorted right back to a room where Dr. Yabuki was waiting for me & he followed full infection control precautions so I felt totally safe. Dr. Yabuki gave me almost painless injections to numb my tooth, & as always, Dr. Yabuki treated me successfully & I left with a healthy tooth again with  a new filling.<//review>< UserId.>

< Review>
This location is within the Del Amo mall which is a nice center with a nice variety of stores and restaurants.  The Banana Republic appears to be one of their newer, updated designed stores.  The store was clean and organized.  They have a nice selection of mens wear and seem to be stocked with a good quntitiy of sizes.  It appears they carry styles that other stores may not carry.  The sales associates were helpful and acknowledged me when I needed assistance.< /Review>

Hi,
The only banana republic store that i ever visit that is not comfortable and nice, I have been shopping with banana republic  all over los angeles area and it surrounding, there's an incident by supposedly the manager but i think is not cause a real manager that been train by their  main office  wont act like that, they watched you , hoovering around  you and chat with other employees, thinking that you will steal something,  that is disrespectful,  that i am working a job and want to spend my money in banana republic what you doing is the same as dont shop here...go shop to the competitors, which i will do.<//Text>

He was on time and done in less than an hour. He's very professional and I would highly recommend his services.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Nothing but good things to say.   We had, what turned out to be a minor emergency, that could have turned into a much bigger problem if not dealt with properly and timely.  Called him in the evening after a contractor we used said he heard good things about this business.  He came over the next morning and worked diligently to find the issue and then took the time to get it fixed the same day.   Always nice to know that we have a plumber we can go to with confidence if anything goes wrong in the future.</text>

Excellent service!! Had an issue with a 1year old water heater I had another plumbing company had installed. He came out diagnosed and fixed the problem in under 24hours, which was very much appreciated. Will be calling redwood plumbing from now on. Thanks Joshua!</review>

I am thrilled! So relieved to have my pipes flowing freely again. Thanksgiving was difficult with a back up in my pipes. They brought a monster machine to clear everything and now Christmas is looking brighter! Reasonable price too.

I recommended them to my relatives. They replaced their main water line. Afterwards, the toilets and faucet water lines clogged up. They refused to call back or come back to resolve the issue. Had to call another plumber who resolved the issues in less than 1 hr. I will not recommend them ever again.< /review>

<review>I've contacted Redwood Plumbing twice for my >80 year old mom and Josh has squeezed her job in the same day both times. I'm relieved to know a plumber I can call without dread.  On the contrary, both my experiences have been completely positive and satisfying.  Just know he works well after 6PM.  Call Redwood Plumbing.<//review>< user_name>

<user_name>Wayne Cox</user_name><Time>1592541504187< /Time><Text>I first called on Josh about 2 years ago when I discovered a pretty substantial leak under my house while trying to figure out why the sewer line was clogged (two totally separate problems that were unrelated). None of the other companies that I called were available, nor did they seem interested at all in the job. I called Josh, he ANSWERED the phone (seemingly a rarity these days) and was at my house fixing BOTH problems in just a few hours. Polite, professional, prompt, and very reasonably priced.

This time, I called Josh at about 9:30 at night after discovering another blocked drain that was negatively impacting a home construction project. I was on a tight time schedule, had to get it fixed before the next stage of construction starting the next morning, and had my fingers crossed that he was available. He wasn’t only “available”, he was at my house 30 minutes later with a good attitude (after a 12 hour day already!) and some awesome tools/equipment that cleared my drain in no time flat. Then, at no extra charge, he basically designed a drainage system improvement that will prevent the drain from clogging again and told me what to buy and how to install it! I would have paid hundreds of dollars to have someone else design the system and Josh did it at no additional charge after he’d already been paid and could just as easily left - waiting for me to call when the system failed again. But that’s not Josh’s style...

I’ve referred Josh to anyone that’s asked for a plumber recommendation, and have no concerns that he’ll always satisfy his customers with a job done well, very fairly priced, and on time.  I can’t say I “look forward” to calling Josh again, but chances are another plumbing “issue” will come up with my 100 year old house, and when it does I’ll know just who to call!!

Thank you Josh, you’re awesome (and you always answer your phone!!).<//Text><user_id>113035427885731060443< /user_id>< rate>

Very professional. We called and got a call back later that night to have him show up to see what was wrong. Shortly after he started fixing the problem and ran into more issues then expected. I appreciate the fact that he never gave up and kept doing the job till he was finished. He was very nice and professional and made it easy to understand what was going on. I highly recommend calling them for your plumbing issues, I know I will definitely be using this company for any future plumbing issues. Thank you for the help.</review>

I briefly explained what I needed fixed before he asked if he could call me back. I figured he would forget all about me. Then not even 20 minutes later I was telling him my address so that he come could fix my problem the same day that it started!! He came with everything he needed to repair the water leak under my bathroom sink and clearly knew what he was doing. He was polite, efficient, and cleaned up after himself. He took the time to explain everything he did in detail and gave me a    more than fair price. I will never call another plumber as long as I live in Humboldt County.

We were adding a large addition onto our home and our plumber That we had hired became ill and couldn’t do the job. We were on a strict timeline and contacted numerous local plumbers to no avail, they were all booked up for 6 to 8 weeks , time we didn’t have. We got ahold of Josh from Redwood Plumbing who promptly came to look at the job. Josh explained that he too was slammed with work but seen the predicament that we were in. Josh gave us a real fair bid and said they could make it happen and they did. Josh and a couple of his employees worked all the next week well past dark to get the job completed on our timeline, they definitely went the extra mile for us. We will surely be hiring Redwood Plumbing for any future plumbing needs.<//text>

We cannot thank Josh enough for coming out so late at night to snake our plumbing. We called & he was at our house within 5 minutes! He was very friendly, thorough & knowledgeable. He went above and beyond to camera and locate the problem & was very reasonably priced. We are so appreciative and will definitely be using him in the future. I highly recommend!!<//text>

I had a good experience with Joshua. Major plumbing problem and was told it would be days for other plumbers. I was concerned he was not as booked up as the others but took a chance when he said he could come out that morning.  Joshua walked me through everything he did and educated me on my plumbing system. Fair price....I think. Not sure what others charge and calling out a plumber is never cheap.  I’m going to replace a toilet and plan to have him back.  Steve   Fortuna</text>

<Review>I don’t know where to begin on telling you about Joshua and his team. First they came out on a Sunday and did whatever it took to find our leak he made sure I got the right valve for my tub to finally work. I know it was a pain in the butt digging out all this concret but hey made sure to get the job done and done right. Where others were afraid of taking on this job they came at it head on I couldn’t be more happy with his service. If you need to get the job done this is who you call. Thank you so much 😊<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I called this guy after asking my realtor for a referral. I had already been stood up by two other plumbers. He showed up that day, took care of my issue, seemed like a reasonable price and it was great. The leak I had was causing me so much stress and not having a plumber to rely on showing up was too. Its nice to know if I need this guy he will get it done for me and do a good job.<//review>

I have a 127 year old house packed with plumbing problems. I had called another company that gave me a bid of about 1600 dollars for several things needing immediate attention. I am a senior and on limited income.  Joshua showed up after working all day somewhere else and did not leave until the main problem was fixed and came back the next day and fixed the rest. It was no where near 1600 and in fact he did more work at half that. I am forever grateful and have already told him when the rest of the work on plumbing is going to be done I am calling him. He cleaned everything up , was polite and understanding and the price I could not have been happier with. I highly recommend Redwood Plumbing and it’s owner Joshua Buchanan to anyone in need of any plumbing job.
Thanks Again Redwood Plumbing you saved my house.< /review>

I had the best experience with Redwood plumbing !!! I have delt with other plumbers in the past and felt I did not get a good deal!!! With this company they went above and beyond my expectations!!! I had my main sewer line backed up and as soon as I called him they where there within 30 minutes and the quality of service was excellent!!! A lot of things others high price companies would have charged a arm and leg for he provided for free!!!! The quality was excellent!!! I would highly recommend Redwood Plumbing too ANYONE that is looking for a great plumber!!!</Review>

He was professional and seemed knowledgeable the job was done quickly and cleanly and although he didn’t get our call until late in the day he was there that same evening and got us unplugged ! That’s the second time we used him and if we ever have a drain cleaning issue again we will definitely be calling Josh< /Text>

My wife and I asked for a deluxe pedicure but it was nothing more than basic.  The rub was less than a minute and the hot stones were cold. If we ever go here again,  we will only have the basic service because anything else will be a waste of money and time.</text>

I can in today and Jenny helped me, very kind and was very good nail technician. I will difently be back, prices have went up a bit but that is due to Covid-19 shutting so many places down. And it's close to home, another plus.< /text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>The building is nice and the set up is cool. Alot of nail salons sometimes look like they could use a good remodel but this one although you cant tell from the outside is actually pretty nice inside. I'm still new to them so I dont have much experience with the nail techs. Never had a new set only fills and no designs yet. So far I've been satisfied with what I've received and I'll definitely be back.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<review>I love this place, the ladies are nice and fun to talk with while getting my haircut, I've been going there now for the past 6 years, as long as they are in business I'll go there, the pricing is perfect and I always am happy with the results plus they trim my eyebrows, mustache and around my ears, they also will shave my face but I've decided to grow a beard since the pandemic, take my word and try this wonderful place you'll love it also.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I was new to the neighborhood about a year ago when I first tried this nail salon. I thought they did a great job but I thought I should try out some other salons before I decided on one. None of the others in the area compared to the care and service provided here. Even if other places have higher reviews, (in my opinion and experience) this is the best by far. They always do a good job on my nails and are fast without being sloppy. I've been helped by different nail technicians and everyone seems to have the same high standards and excellent results. I am more than satisfied with this nail salon and I will continue to stay with them.< /review>

I was very pleased with my experience. Both of my nail technicians used strong attention to detail, which is crucial to the finished look. The girl who did my pedi was super sweet and her massage was on point so I will definitely be back! I also love how they have two people working on you at the same time. Because of this, my full set and pedicure only took an hour but it was not rushed at all.< /Text>

Worse service. They ask cash instead of credit card on the operation on holidays without any notice posted in regards of that. Each staff tells different prices for the same services. They charge extra on tripping or filling nails on a refill$3 on top of $28 only for refill. Some employee is so loud and rude. Also they push u to buy a slip on after pedicure. Unfriendly kids place for sure. They charge a lot but overall unprofessional and unfriendly. Shocking on a cash request they ask.</text>

<review>I called and asked how much a regular fill cost and the lady stated it was $18. I got there and she charged me $31. She’ll make people drive all the way there just to jack up the price. No integrity at all. I told her but you said a regular fill is $18 and she responded with $3 for shortening your nails and $3 for shaping your nails...every little thing was an extra cost...she really epitomizes the stereotype of the Vietnamese manicurist media makes fun of...they really suck the money out of you...even if your nail broke they’ll charge you $5 for nail repair...I didn’t tip at all...this place is all kinds of shady< /review><UserId.>113333067521380463769</UserId.>< rate>

This is a very nice little shop.  They have a great pedicure selection, and the staff is very friendly.  I have been to at least 6 different shops in Antioch and this one has satisfied me the most as far a service, cleanliness and good atmosphere.</Text>

< Review>
The older man did my pedi. Let me say i was in a bad mood when i arrived 10 minutes after being in the chair i was chipper. As my feet soaked Sofia came over to start my full set. Some people dont like this but im a busy mom of 2 so anything to save time i love it. They tag teamed my hands and feet. I was out of there in an hour and my nails are flawless. I got a deluxe pedi and a full set no gel polish for 65 which isn't bad. Will return soon.</Review>

Over priced n crappy work. Went in Saturday for 1 mani 2 fills n 1 pedi n spent over $160 bucks .I will not ever go back there again .I dont recommend this place. Not to mention my nails were all filed crooked. I couldnt even enjoy my pedi due to ladies doing my fill at the same time n had to hold my arms up. I felt so rushed n pushed out and it wasnt even busy.< /review>

No complaint about the staff! They were really lovely and always checking if we needed anything
Will I bring my family here again
NO! NO! NO! Never coming back</review>< date>

Yummy food but way overpriced. Hadn’t been in years however could not believe how the prices went up so much for such small portions. The salad bar was good as usual but a lot less selection of vegetables.<//Text>

Sizzlers is not what it used to be. Their Decor is dated and it is apparent that this is a place that attracts older people. The toast they provide is always the best, the other food is so-so. There salad bar has a good variety of foods but their pasta and their salad bar are hit-and-miss. This was a good convenient location for my husband and I to get away from the Heat Intuit air condition location for dinner. But the customer service was good it was fast and service with a smile.< /review>

<Text>Well, service was. Very good, very attentive, however the steak and lobster was not at all like the picture on the wall!
It was the size literally of a chicken strip  and five bites of steak though it was perfectly prepared.
It was very disappointing for 23$ plus tax<//Text>< Pictures>

This place was horrible DO NOT go here!!! Yuck. The customer service was excellent, but the restaurant, was a waste of time and money.. the salad bar was a mess with food thrown everywhere! There was soup all over the counter, the lettuce was a weird brown color 🤢 they had no fresh fruit whatsoever. Nothing at the salad bar appeared to be fresh and I couldn't believe it. The unlimited shrimp was disgusting! Go somewhere else if you're hungry</Text>

THE FOOD IS BLAND, NOT APPETIZING AT ALL. AND THEY TRY TO DRAIN YOUR ACCOUNT!!!! I AM LITERALLY TRAUMATIZED!

So Sizzler team responded for everyone to think they had made good on the bad experience i had on 10/12/19. I answered their email. They didnot attempt to contact me personally. I have eaten at this location for minimum 11 years. No more. Never again. Food is lousy and cashier is shady!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<Text>The STEAK & LOBSTER is truly a deal during this Christmas Season.  However, the portions are NOT what you see on the commercials.  The portions are like those of a Child's Plate.  It comes with no salad nor drink.  Add both to have an enjoyable meal; otherwise, you'll be staring at others plates.< /Text>< Rating>

The service was awesome. The music was great(they were playing oldies). I ordered steak and unlimited shrimp. Food came fast(it wasn't busy at the time) I asked for my steak well done which it was as well as tender and juicy. Most places will serve you dry and tough meat when you ask for it to be well done. This place overall is a great location. The times I've been there it's never too busy, the food has always been great tasting and service, exceptional.<//review>

The service was awesome. The music was great(they were playing oldies). I ordered steak and unlimited shrimp. Food came fast(it wasn't busy at the time) I asked for my steak well done which it was as well as tender and juicy. Most places will serve you dry and tough meat when you ask for it to be well done. This place overall is a great location. The times I've been there it's never too busy, the food has always been great tasting and service, exceptional.< /text>

Sizzler is a great place to take the family. The service and the food were great. Nice, friendly people. This location needs renovation. The furniture looks old. Overall it's close by the house and I like it.< /text>

Went there for the last time at least at this location!! Me and my mom ordered food that cost $50 and both of our plates of food was cold! Yes cold we told them to take it back and warm it up but the cooks barely did, the one in Carson is awesome tho. Also they need to rip out the old carpet and replace it with new carpet. And the tables need to be replaced as well. Don’t go to the one on Atlantic Avenue!!</review>

Mixed vegetables seem like their thawed out and heated in a microwave bag (bland). The meats are all cooked differently when we ordered 3 different types all at medium well. the one I was served was grayish looking when cut into when I ordered it medium well . This place puts the franchise to shame.  Their booths had tables in a sloped angle and found a nat that flew to my cup. And noticed the window frames rotting out just painted over.

The were friendly, helpful, and hard working. The food and selection of items at the salad bar was fine. Unfortunately, the restaurant itself is a disaster! What a mess. The mess and disaster have nothing to do with the employees, they do the best possible with what they have to work with.

I had the salad bar. The chicken was nasty it had more doe than meat. And the fruit wasn't sweet. Some of the other dinner that my party had didn't look good either. I doubt if I would go back.< /Text>

Went there because it used to be a great place to have dinner. Ordered the steak and lobster. Supposed to be an 8 oz steak got more like a 5 oz steak the lobster tail was rubbery and over cooked and the mashed potatoes where surely from the day before.< /Text>

<Review>Went there because it used to be a great place to have dinner. Ordered the steak and lobster. Supposed to be an 8 oz steak got more like a 5 oz steak the lobster tail was rubbery and over cooked and the mashed potatoes where surely from the day before.</Review>< Date>

< review>
Staff was.friendly and great service. The restaurant was disgraceful. Nasty rugs, scratched-up tables. Bathroom smelly with toilet paper all over the floor. Waited guite a while for two hamburgers.i was embarrassed for the staff. Where is the health department? I own a restaurant and these conditions would not be tolerated. There were also bugs. The one star is for the staff, specifically  the servers.<//review>

< Review>
This one on Del Amo Blvd is in a bad location., dangerous at night.  But its closest to my job so when i want a shrimp fix, i go here.  The steak and all you can eat shrimp is a classic menu item. Unfortunately,  the steak continues to shrink in size.  I don't like that this location does not offer discounts for AAA or AARP members. They do accept coupons from newspaper/mailings. Interior is kind of shabby including the bathroom . Which is often dirty or undermaintained.  Food is consistently good, salad bar is well stocked<//Review>
