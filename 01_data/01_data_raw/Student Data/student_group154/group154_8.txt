<Text>Arrived 9:54pm tonight per policy and the woman at the front refused to let me pick up my mobile Pre-order. Never had a problem before. I had to work late and they could have told me they are closing early on the phone when I called.< /Text>< pictures>

Nice and helpful people.
Prices are not to bad.
Of course taxes make legal buying almost not worth it you will find a large variety of flower, cartridges, wax & eatables.<//Text>

Great shop, lots of options. One main con is a
lot of the flower sitting on shelf is 3-6 months old. Some even older and it's still being sold at full price. I noticed they add their own packaging labels with different packaging dates than what's on the jar. I got one that said packaged in June but was really packaged back in February from the actual supplier. They need new and fresh products.< /review>

One of the best shops in the valley because of their broad selection. The budtenders take time to help you with whatever questions you may have. It's pretty busy in there, but it moves like a well oiled machine. I wish I could remember the name of my budtender so I could say thank you for your help, but either way.</Text>

The staff here will guide you the right way upon telling them the type of mellow you are looking for and they will take great care of you which is rare to find now a days at dispensaries.</text>

Prices are great and the staff is cool. Also, they stepped up their curb side service option.  It’s really nice not having to get out of the car and I drive out of my way past several other dispensaries for that benefit.  Thank you from a happy customer!<//review>

The worst experience i've ever had at a dispensary. The inside is beautiful but the staff has no idea what they are doing, and if you have a State card forget about it. I went in asking about the specials the women had no idea what anything is and what it was used for. Obviously new but with out help. Then when I was ready to check out after an hour ( it was like pulling teeth to get to this point) I showed my State card and these gals had no idea what to do. Another hour goes by and I can finally pay cause well they kinda figured it out. But wait they have to do a separate transaction on two items. Needless to say after another half an hour I thought I was finally done. Got home and figured out I was still charged full price of some items that were on special and tax even with my state card. NEVER AGAIN.<//Review>

<Review>Let me start off by saying that I frequent dispensaries often, as I do like to venture out and support local shops. I’ve visited multiple dispensaries and this has, by far, been the worst experience. Front desk was incredibly rude - I felt as if I were a nuisance and a total bother to them. I’ve never experienced such treatment - I won’t be doing business here any longer. Please check in with your staff, as I don’t wish this treatment to be carried out any further.

THANKS.<//Review>< pictures>

Hello, I've been going to Authentic 760 regularly the past month if not longer. The staff are usually warm and always greet you. The flower is normally above par, kind of the reason I frequent the store so often. I looked at some flower the tender recommend and decided to buy it for $68. While preparing a small bowl I noticed hard pieces of stems and or seeds in the buds. (Dozens of them) The bowl tasted burnt and harsh. Unable to consume this flower I returned it, even leaving the 8th I purchased with the tender asking her to speak to her boss about a reimbursement. I then purchased 2 more 8ths of different flower and went home. After letting 2 days pass, I went into Authenic today only to find out "the owner is aware of the situation" via the tender.  But offered nothing as contribution,  discount,  money back or even the flower I returned back. I'm not sure if its bad customer service,  lack of compassion for patients and customers or just greed. I recommend driving an extra mile to visit a dispensary who actually cares for its patients/customers not just seeing them as dollar signs. ✌<//Review>

They do not have their prices and sales together. Not a single person was on the same page of whether the taxes were included into the prices labeled and then theres a 20% off deal going on which ended up being so called " already included" in the labeled prices that even the taxes weren't included on. They are not knowledgeable about their product and only want to push stiizy on people cause that's who funded their opening. WILL NOT RETURN OR RECOMMEND!< /Review>

<text>I didn’t appreciate being overcharged and not receiving my change back.   The staff ripped me off and did not refund my money!  In error, the staff overcharged me for an item that I purchased and after paying I brought the error to their attention and they said I'd get store credit only, no cash back.  SERIOUSLY! BAD! For BUSINESS! If you read other one-star reviews on weedmaps.com there are other customers who have also been ripped-off & overcharged by this dispensary.  If I'm paying in cash at your store and you overcharge me I expect cash back in hand. Not store credit!<//text>< pics>

If you haven’t been to rainbows in awhile they moved over to where Factory 2 u used to be. A door down. It’s a bigger building however the quality of their clothing is not what it used to be. Very indoor swap meet type of style. I will say the prices are cheap. Parking is still okay depending on the time/day of the week. The cute boutique feeling when you once entered the old location is not there at this new location. Hopefully with the move there are better merchandise coming soon. If not I will continue to go to other chic stores.<//Review>

Update Feb 2021 - This location is now closed! :(

I had a great experience here and so glad I discovered a location in SD because I was going to LA and Texas to get my Rainbow shopping on! It's a large store with a variety of clothing and well stocked on the footwear.  There are no fitting rooms but you can try on items over your clothes. I found some cute pieces and realized everything sold online is not in the stores.  You can take a chance and purchase online and if you don't like it, return it to your nearest Rainbow.  Now my #1 go to store to shop!< /text>

Great store. They moved into the old Factory 2 U location next door. They have children's clothing as well as adult clothes. Haven't been since they moved but everytime I went here I found something I liked (will update asap). Cute stuff, sweet clearance and sometimes they have sales too. The salespeople are always nice. I gave 4 stars because they don't have dressing rooms which is kind of weird for a clothing store.<//Review>

Ok, yowzer! This place has the most outrageous selection of plus size clothes I've ever seen in one place. The prices are so low! They have everything from workout wear to formal skirts and dresses. They have dusters for $12. If you look hard enough, you can put together entire outfits for $30. The only real drawback, you can't try anything on. Be prepared to try things on over what you're wearing. The clothes they have are colorful and fun. Not like what you'd see at Lane Bryant.< /text>

After I posted that, Rainbow responded by saying the layout of some stores may not allow it.  Let me be more clear: there was a dressing room, it was closed. Tape across, sign saying dressing room unavailable.  Taking a quick peek, it was very dusty.  The employee said this store just opened for business, so dressing rooms were still being finished.  Who opens a clothing shop with dressing rooms not finished?  A cube, a mirror, a door?  How long has this shop been in business here?  Still one star.</Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Most negative signage of any store I've ever seen. Why would anyone want to go through their front door. No backpacks. No animals. No bills over $20. No loitering. No bare feet. Etc. Etc. Etc. OK. Some of these are givens, but not one positive statement is perplexing. How about CUSTOMERS WELCOME?< /review><gmap_id>0x80d956d2a80d412d:0x7f92b7eaa01c15d< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

They relocated a few months ago and still have no dressing room. The sales people are so rude. So, you can't try on their clothes and their return policy is 1 week. Delusional if they think this is how you run a clothing shop.
Employees refuse to offer assistance, are rude when asked about a dressing room and in condescending tones, explain a 7 day return policy for Store Credit only! This store is in desperate need some serious changes in order for this store to be successful. Finish building the dressing rooms! Change your return policy and still offer returns back to original method of payment, replace the rude, lazy, gossipy and uninviting sales girls.
Ive gone in there every 2 weeks for the last 4 months, same excuse about the dressing rooms. The return policy changes everytime, according to the mood of the sales person. I have asked for assistance and the store employees give an attitude with every question or request. Horrible! Too bad,
Before the relocation, I've purchased at least $1,000.00 of merchandise.
Now, $00.00. If I can't try on clothing, get descent store assistance and have a normal return policy, You don't deserve my business!</Review>

I was a little surprised by the clerk, not asking if she could help me find anything. The store was clean and they had a nice selection of sweaters and blouses. The prices were excellent ($14.99 for most)</Text>

While attempting to exchange a belt I just bought last week with tags still attached I was told accessories are nonrefundable. I pointed out that wasn't stated on my receipt, nor was I verbally told that at the time of purchase. Another sales associate pulled out a written report policy which only states earrings, bathing suits, lingerie could not be returned. Belts nor accessories in generally were mentioned. I was begrudgingly allowed to exchange the belt and was meet with hostility during the transaction.< /review>

They have moved to a new store and there is no longer any fitting rooms. There are things that cant be returned and you cant try them on. If they are not going to have a fitting room then they should amend their return policy to match.<//text>

This is my local library and I come here all the time. It’s very nice and quite big. They have a good selection of books it’s just that the Raina Telgmeier book are hard to find. Those books are my personal favorites. They have a lot of Geronimo Stilton books which is good because I read them a lot!< /Text>

< Review>
there is a lot of noise at the information desk and the noise and loud paling disturbing to read and focus on research.
Library, especially staff at the Information Desk must be notice customers to respect the calmness around the library.

I come to the library to use it a quite space to study, but I do not see a lot changes between here the place that l live.

I hope changes could be occur.< /Review>

< Review>
My experience so far has been exceptional ! Originally I went there on a whim as it was actually open on a Sunday. Since then I have  gone there to use their computers, and laptops. And I have found many DVD  resources that are also exceptional, my two favorites being the Fringe TV series and an outstanding miniseries called America. Muscle cars.  Outztanding  Library the people are friendly the resources are great and need to spend up to four hours on a computer<//Review>

They have a great selection of vapes, glass, and they even have a humidor. They also have another shop in the Auto Zone parking lot with a bigger glass selection.< /Review>

Great prices, excellent customer service (except for that one employee am I right?!?!) I've been coming here for four years and will continue to do business here at least another four. Kyle, Roddy keep up the great work.<//Text>

The most amazing staff with excellent prices. The store is clean, organized, with thousands of smoke related products. They have a huge selection of fine cigars as well.  For sure No other smoke shop better in the area. Five stars all the way!< /Review>

<Text>Got my #AltoVaporPodMod and appreciate the vape alot since it's very sleek as well as easy to use. I ran into the vendor at Western Tobacco + CBD and he gave me a "steal of a deal". Also bought my rich tobacco flavors that contain 2.4% of nicotine.<//Text>< resp>

It's a very friendly place. Could do with a little help in the customer service area but overall it's o.k.< /Review>

<Date>1620345600000<//Date><Rate>None< /Rate><Text>The staff here were incredible. They were all friendly and attentive. The problem was with the condition of the property. One of the two beds in my room had sheets that were obviously dirty. On both beds, the blankets under the main comforters were riddled with holes.The door to the room didn’t close all the way unless you shoved it, hard, and it was missing the emergency security latch. The bathroom door was also difficult to open once the door was closed.The little refrigerator in the room was obviously broken on the inside, and wasn’t very cold at all.Overall it served its purpose, but they really need to get in there and replace blankets and make sure their rooms are functional and secure.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Nice rooms, cute little entryway. Girl that was working the front desk was pleasant, super sweet and personable. The only thing I have negative to say would be the lack of any kind of USB charging Box/lamp/ Alarm. I forgot to bring  9 and ended up having to drive to the store nearby to pick one up. Ask the front desk if they had anything  I could use to charge my device with, surprisingly they did not. I feel like even the worst hotels these days have USB charging ports in setups in the Room. They need a Tech update big time period but other than that it was fine. Laundry Room was clean, pool was not open but looked nice. I would definitely recommend to a friend  & would In visit again  if. the need arose<//text>

Parking was good. Freeway noise very loud. Room was run down.so so...Bed was comfortable. Shower ok.NO COFFEE ANYWHERE NO CUPS AT ALL. you have to drink out of the faucet to take a pill...All you get for the money is a bed and shower.For the same high price.. this was a 49.00 room that cost 84.00..I for one won't go back. Motel 6 is cheaper and better.< /Review>

<rating>None<//rating><Review>Overall, very disappointing stay. Terrible service and the property looks nice from the outside, but is  in poor repair overall.  We got a family suite, and the layout is really weird, they didn’t have enough towels or bedding for the pull out bed. So of course I tried to call to ask for those things, and the front desk wouldn’t ever answer   So I had to go down and ask. Then, it still  took two hours and only the bedding showed up. The vending machines didn’t work, the fitness center was closed, as well as the pool and there was no breakfast.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc723fd3bf6d75:0x6ac7688ef6e85fbc<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Positive: Extremely clean. From the rooms to the parking lot, everything is kept immaculate. Negative: Pool and all outdoor seating is unavailable due to Covid even though all the other hotels are allowing at minimum outdoor seating.< /Text>

<Review>Positive: Extremely clean and safe. Daytime staff and maids were very friendly and accommodating. Everything is always being wiped down and sanitized. Negative: While everything has been cautiously opening here in San Diego, the pool area was not open...not even to sit by. Also no sitting in the courtyard so absolutely no outdoor area to enjoy. Evening staff not as friendly.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

Room extremely outdated and dingy. Bed made a lot of sounds. Also, the “incidental” fee of $70 seems VERY high and when my bank went to release the money back it was not the full amount and should have been. When I called the hotel to ask, they said it wasn’t $70. they held but rather $63.18. Confusing as I didn’t have any incidentals. Buyer beware here. Also, their vending machines are the old fashioned kind that require coins, not credit/debit cards and no ATM onsite.< /text>

Positive: Staff was very welcoming and hotel was extremely clean. Exterior is also kept immaculate. Negative: Through it is convenient to have the highway access so close, the downside is highway noise. All the positives though outweigh this.< /review>

I like the family oriented atmosphere of this property. All common areas are closed due to the covid 19 ( breakfast, swimming pool), but they could have at least a coffee maker in each room.< /Text>

<Text>The room smelled musty, there were 3 irritating flies that constantly landed on us in our room. The sign out front advertised “renovated” rooms but this does not include the bathroom. Our bathroom was not cleaned and still had water in the tub from the previous occupant. There was also dried toothpaste spit all over the sink handle and mirror (gross). The bathrooms are old and heavily stained. The alarm clock in our room went off at 5am (we didn’t set it) and when I went to turn it off, the alarm clock was sticky and gross - so now I’m laying in bed wanting to go back to sleep but I have a gross, sticky hand. This hotel is WAY overpriced. In a single word I can best describe this hotel as grungy. I definitely would not stay here again.< /Text><Name>KimH<//Name><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc723fd3bf6d75:0x6ac7688ef6e85fbc<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

< review>
My fiance and I have been staying here for almost a month as we are waiting for our apartment to be ready. We have 2 well-trained, well-behaved, friendly service animals. They are a Husky mix and under 2 years old. Some time after I paid this morning, I received a call in my room from the manager, Sal, saying that we would have to check out  in the morning that they were not going to extend our stay anymore because it was brought to his attention that we had dogs in our room. I said "yes, they are service animals". He said , "well unfortunately we are not going to be able to extend your stay. You should have told us in the beginning."

Well, Sal, per the law I do NOT have to tell you ahead of time that I have service animals. Kicking us out because we have service animals is discrimination. What you are saying is that I have to tell you about my disability ahead of time in order to stay in  your establishment. If my dogs were a wheelchair, would the same apply? If my dogs were a home health aide, would I have to tell you about him/her ahead of time? So why do I have to tell  you that I have service animals ahead of time? According to the American Disabilities Act, no such notice is required and it is unlawful for you to kick me out because of my service animals and because I didn't give you advance notice I was checking in with them.

We are also Platinum Wyndham Rewards Members. You would think that being Platinum members (when Diamond is the only level left) of your loyalty program, your company would show a little more loyalty and not just discard us like yesterday's news. Obviously we have been spending money here to get to that level. I am extremely dismayed at being treated in such a manner. I expect such treatment from the dirt-bag motel down the street but I did not expect it from an establishment with the Wyndham name, especially since you boast "SERVICE ANIMALS ARE WELCOME" for all your hotels! That really should read "SERVICE ANIMALS ARE WELCOME ONLY IF YOU GET OUR PERMISSION IN ADVANCE TO HAVE ONE". Your company is too big, too well-known for you to be this ignorant of the laws and to actively participate in discrimination against anyone particularly of the disabled. I'm ashamed of you and will pursue this issue as far as I need to .

In addition, the front desk prior to this had informed us that it was coming up on 28 days that we had been staying here. Hotels try to do this to circumvent the law that would give one tenancy if staying in the hotel for 30 consecutive days because if you check out and then check back in the next day, you have to wait another 30 days to get tenant rights. If you move out every 28 days, you never achieve tenancy. This game that your hotel, along with several other hotels, is playing  is illegal and could result in your hotel being fined $500 each time it does this. $500 does not sound like a lot once but if everyone who you did it to came forward, I imagine it would add up to some hefty fines.

So I will not remain silent. I will tell whoever will listen that Days Inn in Carlsbad on 3700 Pio Pico Dr. participates in the "musical rooms" game to try to circumvent the tenancy law, WHICH IS ILLEGAL and they are also discriminatory, kicking people out because of known service animals brought into their establishment WHICH IS ALSO ILLEGAL.

You guys have some explaining to do!< /review>

Days Inn Carlsbad is a nice, quiet place to stay for a few nights. Staff and employees are courteous and helpful. Guest privacy is well respected. Close to shopping and amenities. Safe location and comfortable, spacious rooms. Cost is comparable to other locations of similar scale. I definitely recommend Days Inn Carlsbad for anyone looking for a place to stay for one week or less in the Carlsbad area.</text>

front desk clerk was incredibly rude.  maybe start off by NOT assuming all guests are out to scam your hotel.  thats incredibly offensive.  having driven 5 hours to get there, and then have to argue with the man while im standing in the lobby with bags on my shoulders and my family waiting is TERRIBLE customer service.  after speaking with the manager things were sorted out, but honestly, it was a crappy experience that we absolutely should not have had to deal with.<//review>

<text>I liked it. It was clean and the staff was nice. The only thing I had to say about the place was that it was just on the other side of the freeway and my rooms window faced it, so the traffic noise I could have done without. Mabey the should do the double glass windows to better help keep the noise out. Other than that , I would stay there again.</text>< UserId.>

The room was incredibly spacious and had a nice size fridge for drinks. My issues with this particular hotel are the incredibly horrible beds they use and the fact that my room was facing the freeway. The two nights I spent at this hotel I got maybe 6 hours total of sleep. The only reason they get one star is because the staff was very nice and accommodating.. Will not be back..</review>

A few minor issues - fridge was noisy,  pillows were on the flat side,  breakfast was all carbs (though plentiful- waffles, bread, pastries, juice, coffee, fruit, yogurt, cereal). Of note, minor details such as bathroom caulking, grout  etc are all in very good repair.
This is not a fancy place,  but I was very happy with the accommodations for the decent price! I would stay there again< /Text>< pictures>

I am giving this hotel 2 stars because the cleaning staff to a good job keeping old rooms presentable. The front staff was also nice. The continental breakfast was just okay. Would have like a bagel and fruit, which they only had apples that did not look so fresh.
The parking lot setup pretty much left a lot to be desired and was designed horribly.  One entrance to get to the one elevator. Which is not fun loaded down with bags. I guess par for the course when the hotel is as small as this one was.
I don't get why so many hotels do not have an exhaust fan. With two people taking warm showers every day for 4 days,  our clothes started smelling moist. Even with keeping used clothing separate.
The bathroom is for short people. I am 5'6" and the shower head was maybe an inch or two above my head. So if you are tall and that bugs you, something to consider.
Finally, the bed was horrendous! If you have any type of back or hip problems, just don't do it. I slept an hour or two at a time and woke up in pain every time. I thought I had a handle on it, but this reset my progression.
Oh and careful with shutting the doors, they are not self closing like a lot of hotels I have stayed at before.<//review>

<review>Received an excellent rate for the 3 nights, got a room at the back of the hotel,  which killed the I-5 road noise. Was able to sleep soundly. Breakfast could have been better, all the had was cold cereal, waffles, and pastries. No eggs, not even cold hard boiled. Small pool, but it's not far from the ocean so the pool isn't really needed.</review>< pictures>

Nice, clean room if you are looking to stay near Carlsbad Beach for a good price with no frills. The hotel is right next to the freeway, so keep in mind there is some freeway noise. The room was big, pretty clean and very basic for a hundred bucks a night. This is mostly a place to stay if you just want to sleep and don't care about amenities.</review>

<Text>The hotel is located right off the freeway so that comes with it's fair share of noise, our room was located on the ground floor on the rear end and we could hear the highway noise loudly. First room we got had a leaking toilet so the manager moved us to the next room once we informed him. The room also had a very strong air freshener smell that was close to nauseating, the room we got moved to was a bit better. The breakfast is bare minimum continental, I expected some eggs but all it had was coffee, waffles, some muffins, and juice, so that was disappointing. Overall it's a "you get what you pay for" 2 star hotel< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Overall it's a three and a half. Because it's just a place to lay your head down and clean up and go to sleep. My first impression of the room was a -5 because it's stunk of some type of chemical I don't know if it was some ridiculous air freshener or someone chemically clean the carpets but the place stunk so freaking bad I had to move rooms. Got another room that smelled 50% less of the same stench, so I opened up the window opened up the door and turn the AC on a vented the room for 30 minutes and finally made it available to live in. Days Inn please no one needs to breathe those type of chemicals even if it's of air freshener that's ridiculous my opinion change it or not I don't care because if it's not changed I won't come back thank you<//review><name>Mike Mosca<//name>< UserId.>

We are Marriott gold members and got upgraded to a large ocean facing room. The rooms were great with a separate sitting area and very modern and cool. We had a great view of the ocean - though it is not waterfront and the view may be obstructed sometime as there is an empty lot across< /review>

Room was clean but the Interior is very outdated. Furniture from the 80's, carpet was from the 1940's! hahaaa. Our room had old smelly carpet that was overly saturated with deodorizer which gave us a runny nose during our short stay. That was the biggest problem. The door to the restroom didn't close, it needed minor carpenter work and the exhaust fan didn't work. The heater worked well but had a urine smell to it. The bed's were modern and comfortable but we decided to leave and go to the EconoLodge next door which was way better and only cost $15 more. I don't recommend this Days Inn. The EconoLodge is modern with decent furniture and upgraded linoleum floors.< /Text>

The location is ok, but the place sits right next to the freeway. If you are a light sleeper you are gonna hate this place. For me, I tend to be mistaken for dead while I sleep so it wasn’t a huge issue. The rooms seem to be insulated enough to ward off most traffic noises until that one semi uses it’s exhaust brake, or a teen decides to stomp on the gas.

As for my major complaints...the floors really need to be cleaned. I wasn’t all to fond of walking around without some sort of protection on my feet. There were obvious signs of staining that should definitely be worked on.

Breakfast is also something that needs to be worked on here. It was easily one of the most pitiful breakfast buffets I have encountered. On the counter you are presented with 2 cereal options, 2 juice options, waffles, danishes, bread, bagels, coffee, and a bowl of fruit that only contained a few apples. First day I stayed I made waffles and promptly tossed them because they tasted watered down. The buffet looks as though the hotel is trying to save money while also claiming they are providing breakfast.

I would stay again, but I won’t be expecting much next time.< /Text><Rating>3< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place was ridiculous especially the guy behind the counter.  Some Indian guy, I dont remember his name.  Paid over 200$ to stay here (1 night) and I always specify how many people I am with.  He preceded to argue with me late a night that I am a liar about how many people are staying with me and saying I was hiding it, as I was walking through the front door. Also in front of my kids. They do have a side entrance.  They never asked and I assumed, sorry booking messed up and I didnt pay attention.  I thought it was ridiculous that we had one king size bed but whatever.  I will not stay here again, manage the place better, thanks!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc723fd3bf6d75:0x6ac7688ef6e85fbc<//gmap_id></record>

This is hands down the worst place you can come too.  Super dirty, but the worst part is the customer service at this hotel.  The front desk guy is the worst ever.  His service in helping us resolve an issue is absolutely ridiculous! They made an error in giving us 1 bed after it was confirmed that I would receive 2 beds, but when I got here they put our reservation as a 1 king bed.  So I kindly told them to change it to a 2 bed again since I have a family of 4, but they said that they would now need to charge extra fee! I was like, "what are you talking about! You guys made the mistake and now you want me to pay more for something I got a confirmation on?!?" The dumb front desk guy says, "yes"...  Lol! This place is a joke! Save your money and don't come to this horrible establishment.< /text>

A little smaller than the pictures suggest, but it's not bad. Room was clean. A manageable downside was that it's very close to a busy highway, so there's a lot of noise.< /Text>

Pretty basic hotel. Pillows are a little flat. Beds were decent. Free breakfast, but mostly just toast and cereal (waffles on Saturday, but might be everyday)</review>

<review>An extremely noisy hotel right off the freeway but the pool is so nice and warm, the rooms are large and clean, and Mike the manager is one of the friendliest people we met during our two weeks in California. We'd DEFINITELY stay here again but we'd make sure to pack earplugs for sleeping.<//review>< Pics>

Next to I5 so very loud with traffic but rooms a areally relatively quiet. Staff is friendly and helpful. Continental breakfast is pretty weak. Sugary cereals, waffle mix is a bit thin and tastes a little weird compared to other hotels, sweet muffins, plain bagels, whole oranges or apples. No yogurt. No protein. Kids like it. Adults don't find much value in the breakfast. Kind of on the expensive side. But very close to legoland. 5-10 minute drive.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>The room was fairly spacious and clean, but everything else was pretty poor. Couldn't see the bottom of the pool for grime, not that you would want to swim in it as it is separated from I-5 by a chain link fence. Free breakfast was at best mediocre. Waffle mix seemed watered down and tasted a bit odd. It's a place to lay your head, not much more.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>It's ok the breakfast is cold keep that in mind. The only hot stuff are coffe and waffles you make. It's starts to get hot inside the eating place. Also I wish they had eggs or sausages like other places or at least yogurt for some good protein all my kids were complaining too much carbohydrates. The walls and floor are very thin we got the room up in the second floor and I can hear the steps above me and I know they can hear me  bellow.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

A little dingier than expected. I think this was a smoking hotel in the past based on the way the room smells and what looks like a burn on the blanket. Highway noise is well muffled when you're in your room which is a plus given how loud it is otherwise.< /Review>

The people that work here forgive me what I'm saying seriously have problems they are very slow minded and the rooms are decent not great but decent and they act like they're Hampton Inn there in a very ugly area they're off the freeway they are so nosy that they question me how many bags would I take off what is that your business if you're the kind of person that doesn't like to be questioned a lot don't stay here because the people that work here are horrible really especially John personally he's the kind a guy that will cry on you he acts like he owns the place he's not even a manager he's a night worker this is for you John you work at night because you have no money you're not a big shot you work at Days Inn for crying out loud not even a nice days Inn hopefully one day you'll wake up and realize you're nothing serious and fix your life Man was so rude evil<//text>

While the room wasn't to clean, hair was on the sink and small pieces of hair in the tub. I worked in housekeeping & I was a supervision in housekeeping..I know how sheets look when they weren't changed after someone slept in them..so I think I wouldn't be coming back..</review>

<review>Wir waren auf der Durchreise 2 Nächte im DaysInn. Wir haben nichts zu bemängeln. Alles war in Ordnung. Unser Zimmer war sehr groß.Das einzige was man anmerken sollte ist, dass der Highway direkt vor der Tür ist und es daher etwas lauter ist. War für uns für die 2 Nächte aber nicht weiter schlimm. Ansonsten liegt das Hotel in der Nähe eines tollen Parks. Etliche Restaurants sind in der Nähe. Genau wie der Strand, der wirklich ein Traum war.<//review><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dc723fd3bf6d75:0x6ac7688ef6e85fbc< /gmap_id></record>

<review>It was our third time to have eaten at this restaurant and again thoroughly enjoyed it. Very busy but the service was great and our food was delivered to our table very quickly. There are lots to choose from, and the price was reasonable. It was recommended by one of our guides on a previous visit. We will definitely come back!< /review>< username>

The couple who own the restaurant are so sweet and the customers are wonderful. I ordered the pho chicken and it was tasty. The meat was good and tender and there was also a great flavor to the soup! Due to a bad experience, it's been years since I've eaten pho, but I think I have found my new favorite pho spot! I also had a Thai tea that was perfectly sweetened.<//review>< UserId.>

<review>Another gem of culinary taste in Down town San Jose. All the small plates are delicious, I love the chicken wings, chicken satays, and especially the Ahi tuna roll. Definitely a place to go back to. It's a beautiful place to hang out with friends and to enjoy good culinary food.< /review>< pictures>

I was tentative when this was a walk up counter place, given its fancier sounding name.  However, the food here is legit, and the presentation is appreciated giving this a more gourmet fast food situation.   The short ribs are some of the better prepared slices I've had in this town - NO BONES! And a big portion!  The second time, I had the noodles, nicely spiced and filling.  I'll be back to try more.  I tried my friend's sweet potato fries and those were VERY tasty.  Next time I'm getting some of those for myself.< /Text>

<review>The owners are the most friendly people they shake your hand and great you every time you come In. The plates and bowls of food are at the highest quality possible. They can make a plate from scratch if needed. The staff is the best from cashiers to chefs and cooks. They price there food below value so you never have to sacrifice quality. Great restaurant that keeps san jose authentic. It's even better when I go with Nick.<//review>< Pics>

Great little find. We usually eat over at SOFA and finally stopped by this place to check it out. Nice Vietnamese/Chinese fusion fast casual place. Garlic noodles  with salmon were awesome as we're the lettuce wraps and spring rolls. We ordered way to much food but looking forward to enjoying the leftovers. Will be back. Great happy hour too with $3 beer, $4 wine, and $5 appetizers!<//text>

If you're looking for a good Pho place with quick service and good flavor, this is your place. The hot noodle soup portions are just a single size now, and quite honestly are pretty damn big. They will accommodate you though if you want to order one  portions ND get two smaller bowls to split.

It's a pretty popular location and can get pretty busy during weekday lunch times, so get there early.< /review>

The food is really very good. The service is hit and miss. You have to watch the wine pours and make sure the guy gives you a full glass. And double check prices cuz what they have listed is not what they charge you. For example I order the teriyaki salmon, listed at $13.95 and they charged me $15.95. When I asked him about it he just shrugged.< /Text>

< review>
I just went there tonight on a whim. I tried the crispy egg rolls and they were delicious! Meaty too, not just tons of cabbage in there, and very crispy, served on a place with lettuce, mint, and a nice dish of fish sauce.

Very nice people too! The proprietress and I discussed the smell of firecrackers on Chinese New Year (I love it, she's not a fan lol) and while we talked, the proprietor had my egg rolls all fried and ready sooner than expected.

I can see this place is going to be a "go-to" place that matches well with the coffee shop next door.

Edit: I went back the next evening and tried their chicken wings - they're great! Better than Bon Chon in my opinion.</review>

<Review>I ordered my sandwich combination at 5:10pm. After waiting for 30 minutes the lady who took my order told me it was almost ready. When I asked her if it normally took them over 30 minutes to make a sandwich she told me that they ran out of meat and had to prep more. When I asked her how much longer it would take l, she replied, “not too much longer.” I received my food at 5:50pm. I was already late for work because I waited 40 minutes for a sandwich and I couldn’t even eat it hot, so I asked for a to go box. Horrible service, and very disappointed. Nothing warm and welcoming about my experience at all</Review>< Pictures>

Not in a good location, rude staff. Saw 3 Police Officers walk in, and then watched employees refuse to acknowledge them. Another employee came later and told them that they couldn’t be inside and that they had to leave. Just funny, because I watched multiple people enter and exit the store before them. Just bad costumer service and biased employees. It’s not about them treating the Police bad, it’s about treating everyone equal and respectfully.  Never going back again. Gonna take this  story to local news!!</Review>

Five stars once you add a tip feature!

I never have cash on me (DTLA for crying out loud) and these amazing juice crafters deserve all the tips they can get!! Thank you guys! (Will add five stars when management implements changes!)

Besides not being able to tip—- I love this place!!!!!

Pro tip: Instead of banana substitute coconut meat!< /review>

< Review>
Juices here are amazing . The açaí bowl is to die for. We have tried many açaí bowls from different places and they don’t taste like this one. Be prepared to pay a bit more than usual BUT that’s DTLA life.  Parking is horrible so park Around or next to them for $7 cash only . You can usually walk around DTLA and enjoy other nearby cool coffee shops or businesses .< /Review>

Friendly staff and smoothie was just as great as the ones I'd gotten in San Diego previously. Consistency is important to me. Ingredients are also very unique and have great health benefits. (For example bee pollen & raw cocoa). Not inexpensive but delicious and healthy. The 20oz smoothie replaced a meal for me.</Review>

<Review>This place is really quaint, but with a rustic feel. They offer a great fresh juice menu, and well as ready-made cold-pressed juices. The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable.

I ran into here when I landed in LA, because I felt a sniffle on the plane, and I rarely get sick. I took a spicy lemon juice shot, and tried their Green #3 cold-pressed bottle. Although I was too late in my efforts, and my cold overtook me, I went back the next day for another shot, and had them whip me up a fresh juice blend. I also ordered a fruit bowl that had strawberries, acai, bananas and coconut, and I wish I could tell you how it tasted, but I was stuffed up too bad. But I will tell you that it looked delicious!

The next day, I was almost good as new, and if I would have had time to go back again before I had to fly back to Chicago, I would have. Thanks Juice Crafters, I know if I didn't find you, my cold would have lasted longer, and I appreciate that you supplied the cure!</Review></record>

Really good, extensive menu (almost overwhelming). It is a bit on the pricey side. My biggest qualm with this place is all the upcharges they have on healthy options. Geez, an extra $1.00 to put a few spinach leaves in your drink or get unsweetened acai (shouldn't it be cheaper bc there's no sweetener?</text>

<text>Love their fruit smoothies and meal replacement smoothies they are all delicious! I would go here more often if they had a punch card system to earn a free smoothie. Their prices are a little outrageous but you get what you pay for... A blended organic meal in a cup that will fill ya up!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<username>Thomas Adams</username><Text>Easily one of my favourite juice bars downtown. Better value than most... Prices are pretty reasonable when compared to some of the more well known bars on Melrose and the little touches are nice... Your immunity shot comes with a strawberry to offset the spice.

Very decent selection and the staff is quite nice. If youre looking for a bit then the owners also run a vegetarian panini shop located just next door. Also very good. There is a little bar for seating 5 max and then a small bench outside. Definitely more of a grab and go.<//Text><rating>4< /rating><GmapID>0x80c2c6354d06302b:0x36fb13c613eab399< /GmapID>< date>

<Review>cute little place on spring street. was walking from hero shop to our car when i saw this little juice place. im always craving juice so i had to stop by. i ordered the watermelon/carrot/ginger juice. it was delish and refreshing. viet got a green juice and we bought a beet juice for my brother. beware, juice crafters puts an adequate amount of ginger in their juices. my brother and i both are avid fans of ginger. i asked for "a little extra ginger" in her beet juice and it was overwhelming! speedy service, friendly people, great juice!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Look at photos attached. This belt has been used just for a year and is being thrown away into trash. Everybody please note that this is what Levi’s sells with their brand mark.

I also have a pair of jeans which is less than a year old but a few parts near pockets are torn and they look bad unless used for plumbing work.

Don’t ever buy Levi’s.< /text>

Levi store is located on the lower level,  street side in Horton Plaza.  Took us a while to find it. Very neat and clean store.  Nice friendly staff.</Text>

It seems that Albert signed the management agreement in just his name but we've cleared it up now.  Also, for rents, we will contact you for an increase now. Have a wonderful day and don't hesitate to reach out to myself or any of us if you need any further changes made to your rental property. We value your business.\n\nSincerely,\nKrystle Karimian, Broker\nsales@krystleproperties.com"}<//response>< text>
A professional company with reasonable prices. Sometimes they forget that I'm on the account by staying consistently staying in touch with my husband via HIS email address, and with me only periodically via my separate email address.

Also, I would like them to consider getting a better rate for our rental in accordance with the CURRENT going Bay area rate for our area.

Otherwise Krystal Property Management is doing a fine job.</text>

<time>1619042844203<//time><rating>1</rating><Review>Unprofessional, unethical, perform slipshod jobs and thefts.
As a previous tenant/renter i would strongly suggest not to give Krystle Properties any business.
The unit right next door to me was having toilet issues. Instead of sending a licensed professional they send one of the staff's bf to do to the job. So they are cutting corners and double charging the owners of the building. Anyways the guy messed up (not the first time) causing my toilet to over flow, which caused feces and bio hazard to spill and spread all over the bathroom and the surrounding carpet which is 5 ft from the kitchen where we prepare food. Once we told that guy that our toilet is now overflowing he came over looked around and run off.
I called maintenance who sent out a licensed plumber, who fixed the plumbing problem.
Krystle Properties never sent out a cleaner to clean the caked feces out of our bathroom even thou we were told they would. After making several attempts to contact krystle about the cleaner at the end of the day, 23 hours after the toilet over flowing they told us, the tenants, that we have to contact the cleaner, at that moment they provided the number to the cleaners whom they should have by law and ethics called because they are the management company.
The place smelt horrible due to the fact that feces and bio hazard waste waste soaked into the carpet. 2.5 weeks later Davina came over to inspect. She had a horrible attitude repeating that she doesn't smell anything beside cat pee and it's not sewage that's causing the smell. She told me that she would have the carpet replaced.
We made several attempts to contact the carpet company because Davina refuse to and when they finally came out (another 2 weeks later) they took measurements then told us that krystle would contact us about the carpet being replaced.
Basically, the overflown toilet and the bio hazards waste water that sat in the carpets could have caused serious illness and even death, Krystle Properties refused to treat the matter serious. However i did and they treated me as if i was a problem.

Liars; we were shorted on our security deposit. We were charged $250 for hauling cost because Krystle Properties Management lied. On a document KPM clearly wrote; ---- called day the tenants dumped items. This is the fee please notate this" 2 big tv arm and a mattress set. i spoke with --- and he said he never told them that, he told them the opposite. Krystle Property Management lied about the both of us to pocket $250. That's a shame, how desperate and low does one (or a company in this case) have to be to throw two good tenants under the bus for $250. They pocket $250, which employee pocket that money or was it the company?< /Review>< pics>

<text>Krystle Properties - hands down 5 star rating! Krystle is highly professional and very deligent in her approach as a realtor.  She takes the time to get to know your individual needs and works hard to make a home buyers dream come true. Her responsiveness to her clients supersedes any other that I have worked with in the past. I love her upbeat personality and her optimism as we explored Solano county for my future home.  I highly recommend her!</text>< Pics>

We worked very closely with Stephanie and was very pleased with the results. We relied greatly on Stephanie and the other employees with the handling of our rental properties. From the bookkeeping, repairs/maintenance , finding tenants, and eventually the selling of our properties.  The staff deserves our appreciation.   Our experience is strictly with the employees so be aware owners and treat them right.<//Review>

<Review>I have been with Krystle Properties for several years now.  They have been outstanding to work with.  They've been able to find great tenants, in  a very timely fashion, and deal with all interactions with the tenant, then present any repairs to me for approval.  They make it easy!<//Review>< username>

<Text>We have been super pleased with the services from Krystal Properties .  First off, they found us a top notch tenant right away.  They are extremely responsive and their online communication is the best.  Also their fees are reasonable even for maintenance services. We have used another property mgr in the past and the experience with Krystle properties has been 1000% better.< /Text>< Pics>

I could not find enough words to express our deepest respect and appreciation when it comes to give feedback about Krystle Properties. After having a pretty bitter experience with another leasing agency, Krystle Property was a breath of fresh air.
I consider us (speaking on behalf of my husband as well) very lucky working with Krystle Karimian directly.
Her professionalism and sincerity exceeded our expectations. She met with us on a short notice without any delays and hesitation (do I need to mention it was way pass her normal business hours?!?!).
We had a spark connection from the moment we met in person. She quickly understood our needs, expectations and style to do the business. Her follow-up is impeccable!!  Krystle kept updating us on every step company was taking to lease our Benicia Property.
All obstacle, such as “off - season leasing”, then shelter in place restrictions, tenant’s qualification during COVID-19 shut down and more, were overcome with flying colors!!!
Without further delay, she found an amazing family (tenants) that respect our property and treat it as their own home.
We would recommend Krystle Property to anyone who is looking for a company with honesty, integrity and commitments to provide an exceptional result in speedy matter.</text>

Also it was a pleasant surprise that they auto deposited all the July rents into my bank account on July 1. I have another rental coming available soon and plan to turn it over to Krystle.

Update - now I've been with Krystle for over a year, they are managing six of my properties,  and everything is running smoothly.</text>< date>

Many repairs were needed to my property. Which set me off to a negative start. However the repairs were managed in a good fashion. Just a few more than i expected. Krystle located a secure tenant withing days.  2 months of positive income. The owners portal is very useful, and the email responses and notifications are up to par. Basically, Krystle is managing my property in the most confident manner. Their team has not let me down.  i only gave 4 stars because our business relationship is new. And needs a test of time. So far, so good.<//review>

Best Property Management I've ever had. They even sent me a video of a departing tenant going though a detailed property condition check. They professionally informed the tenant of those things that she was responsible for fixing. And that they could use a professional carpet cleaning service, with billing receipt for evidence, to get their security deposit back.<//Text>

I have known Krystle and Derrick for more than ten years. They have been nothing short of amazing in every interaction I had with them. Not only they are top-notch professionals, they are deeply caring about their clients as friends and family. Here is my simple advice: if you are interested in doing any business real estate related in Vallejo/Benicia area, run, don't walk, to Krystle Properties. I sure am glad I did exactly that ten years ago.<//text>

<Text>I must say I am very pleased with Krystle!  My renter recently gave their 30 day notice and I live 400 miles away.  I was nervous about at the entire process and when you consider this crazy Covid process, it added more anxiety.  What if the renter left things in shambles?  What if we couldn’t find a quality renter?  Do I have to go and preview the property?  Krystle took care of it all and had a new renter in the house in about 4 days of turnaround.  Any normal wear and tear issues were taken care of by their excellent team of professionals (I received emails for every needed repair).  They were able to find a high quality renter at the monthly rate I needed.  And while I sometimes feel like they aren’t getting back to me in the amount of time I was expecting, they always come through and I also realize they have 100’s of properties to manage and mine is not the only one.  This last go around confirms to me why I am content with Krystle properties, thank you!< /Text>< pictures>

This is the best property management company that we have dealt with.  They always find the  best tenants.  I love the screening process that they have.
They also respond to your calls in a timely manner. We started with them listing one property with them but now we are listing everything with them.<//review>

<text>It has been over 10 years now, that Krystle has managed my multi-unit property. During this time we’ve had mostly wonderful tenants, and one not so great tenant. It was in dealing with the difficult tenant that Krystle came through, and earned my everlasting trust. The whole staff is very supportive in all advertising, renting, and maintenance issues. The owners are helpful, and very attentive – even in the most difficult circumstances. I will continue to work with Krystle, for as long as I own the building.

<Text>Well, they went from being a 5-Star down to a LESS THAN 1-Star.  Did you really forget to take our email address off your Automated Review Requests????  This shows how LITTLE you know about your clients and how little you value customer service.  YOU FIRED US, THE CLIENT WITH 3 DAYS NOTICE.  NOT LEGAL, NOT ETHICAL.  My advice to you Derrick, just talk to people, find out what's happening without bias, just pick up the phone and speak with people.  It will go a long way to improve your customer service skill set - which for us is VERY LACKING.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I have a lot of experience with property managers in several towns and Krystle has been good and trustworthy for about 10 years now.  It has been a  better experience than I've had with others.  They respect my boundaries and that I am the final decision maker. and I've had a good income flow. I do recommend them highly. I sometimes wish there was one person to coordinate with instead of multiple departments all working on their own.  It works great with some but not with others.  The new maintenance manager is great to work with.< /text><user>110932041194560539489< /user><Time>1603468728732< /Time><name>R B< /name></record></dataset><record>

We get our rent money on time.
They notify if there are any issues right away which has been almost zero for last 3-4 years.
They are nice to work with.
The most important thing was that they found new tenants for us without any loss in money for us, meaning they were on it!
Overall it’s been great with Krystle Properties and if you own property in American Canyon/Vallejo area, use them!!</Review>

<Text>I have been working with Krystle Properties for 6 years. As a landlord, I could not be more happy with the service they provide. The staff is professional, helpful and highly responsive to the needs of the property and to my requests. I wish I had more properties to give them.

Update: I'm now going on 8 years with them. They continue to crush it. I like how they have improved their use of software to further improve their communications and systems.< /Text><username>James Kojo<//username>< user>

We are so lucky to have a business like Krsytle Properties for finding a tenant for our rental property.  They are hard working, and diligent about being sure they find the right person when we are looking for a tenant.  They always make sure we know when they show the place.  They are polite, and respectful.  If they can’t make an appointment, they are sure to call and let you know.  It is nice working with them.<//Text>

Krystle Property Management makes it easy. They take care of the properties as if they owned them.
They are a pleasure to work with and they have the resources to handle any situation.< /review>

I want to say thank you for being a property management easy button!
Your management skills, your mediation between the tenant and myself and the subcontractors that you supply from time to time, without breaking the bank is great!

Much Appreciated!

As a property owner I could not be more pleased with Krystle Properties.  They have kept my property occupied and well maintained.  The communication and follow through when maintenance issues arise has been prompt and clear.  I give Krystle my highest recommendation, and am grateful to have them as my property manger.< /review>

I'll start out by saying, I usually don't take the time to post  good or bad reviews, but this time is different. My profession has required me to move a great deal over the years. In this particular case I was transferred to the Bay Area. Not knowing much about the area I did happen to see a variety of some very nice homes for our family through Krystle Properties. The one we selected was in Hiddenbrooke. The application process was very simple and we even got to meet Krystle on the day we signed the lease! She is super nice and very professional just like the rest of her staff. If you are looking for a nice property to rent in this part of the Bay Area, there is no need to look any further. Beautiful home selection and a very caring staff. Thank you again Krystle to you and your staff!!!<//Review>

After having been a property owner rental customer for many years I got a call that there maintainence issues that needed addressing.  I replied that I would go down and take a look and was told that my taking a look wasn’t allowed!  Not allowed?! I told them that I either would be allowed to look at my own property or I’d be looking for a new manager.  KRYSTLE allowed it but only with a chaperone from the company.  I arrived to find a lengthy list of issues that had I had never been informed of and that the KRYSTLE person had been going over with the tenant as what needed to be done.  It would seem as though KRYSTLE forgot who they were working for and we parted ways.</Text>

<date>1503107239725<//date><Review>(Long but full of info) I don't usually give a bad review , let alone a review on ANYTHING! But this was HORRIBLE AT IT FINEST!!!! If I could give 0stars I would!!!! During this time in age it is very difficult to live on your own as the rent prices keep going up everywhere you look so we decided to move as a family so it wouldn't be hard on everybody, this place discriminate against AGE and etc.  and it's a fact. Abdul karimian was the one that was handling our family paperwork and was to meet up with him 2 days later after he only ran my mother in-law  and father in-law credit first because they was the oldest in his words and even though my husband was going to be the primary person on the lease do to  his 800+ credit. We met with Abdul the following day and boy I'm NOT over  exaggerating BUT IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!

We went to him said good morning and he had a hard time saying it back as we are holding our hands out to greet him he stated in his words" oh I usually don't say good morning nor do I shake people hands I like to get straight to the point cause I'm a number men I speak numbers" 😶😶😶 then he went on to tell my husband that he have a 20yr old(by the way my husband is not 20yr old he is 24+)  that people like him is not responsible enough and that's he ran the oldest people first. Like it's obvious that he didn't want to deal with us from the gate he act like we came in there looking for a handout we ALL (5) work very VERY good paying jobs at hospitals and some truck drivers. I couldn't believe this guy then he said he will pass it to the owners when we left.

The following day got a text from Abdul saying the owners said to stop running credit and to refund our money back. No problem as I do know sometimes things happen and might not be the perfect fairytale candidates they was imagining. I'll take that fine. Keep pushing . I'm not complaining about us not passing which was already a fail before we left the office,  what I'm complaining about is the level of service that the company should upheld when dealing with customers as you never know what type of situation any family might be in or going through.

So I called to speak to someone hire up and that was a BAD idea as they are ALL  family.  Spoke to Krystal to tell her the experience that was distasteful and unprofessional and only thing should could say that he been doing it for 50years so obviously that's a problem right there he is a old head thinking back in the days. Neither did she care about the problem as she hurried me off the phone.

If you will like your time wasted,   Humiliated and  discrimination then this is the place for you!!! Good luck and the other reviews that raves about this place is fake!!!<//Review>< pics>

KPM has always been great for me personally as well as anyone I refer. Being in a referral based business myself it can be a big risk referring one of my clients to anyone for a service they need because your reputation is at stake for something you have no control over. I’ve had people I work with but I would never refer them because of that. With KPM I don’t give it a 2nd thought as they value service just as much as me and for you property owners trying to manage places yourselves I’d talk to them as they are worth ever penny they charge and over the long-haul you actually save by using them. Better rents, much lower vacancy factors, & you can’t put a price tag on the stress of dealing with a good tenant let alone bad ones. If you are in need of something they offer there is no need to go anywhere else. KPM is the place to be!!<//Text>

<Response>None<//Response><review>Our visit was very unprofessional. We called at least four times to set up an appointment and they never called back.  We finally had to go to the office to set up an appointment, which was an "open house" which was only a 15 min window (the shortest open house I've ever heard of) and the realtor hadn't even seen the place. The whole experience was not very satisfying and they were not helpful unless you went in and bothered them. Even then, however, they did not seem pleased to have my business. You can find better rentals and managers elsewhere.< /review><rating>2< /rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>115363659787308674372<//userid></record>

<Text>Absolute Integrity in Real Estate in the Vallejo, Solano, Napa, area!  In Vallejo there is no competition when it comes to a real estate company that can back up what they say.  None come close to the professional caring attention that this business provides.  I was lucky enough to be in contact with them when I need emergency assistance with housing that also involved my Section 8 certificate.  The apartment I have now looks out over the entire bay and was once consider the location for the original capitol of California. Thank you, Thank you to Krystal & Derrick and all the hardworking team that make up a business that cares about Vallejo.

<date>1429451074460</date><text>5 Stars!!

This is my second time renting a house through Krystle Property Management over the past 5 years. I have nothing but good things to say about the way that Krystle and Derrick have worked with me in finding suitable housing in Vallejo, on short notice. And...I received the rental deposit back from them promptly at the end of my first tenure with them with no hassle.

They are very professional in their approach and have always been very responsive to what few maintenance requests that I made over the years. One thing that I *really* appreciate is the smooth functioning website that they have which allows me to make electronic rent payments and to file maintenance requests from wherever I am as I travel quite a bit and USPS mail is just too slow and inconvenient.

I hope to be able to engage with KPM the next time that I need a rental in the Vallejo area.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x8085731a0a0d23ab:0x2e7e8f4e1267e91c< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

From tours of our possible new homes to closing documents, Krystle was there every step of the way.
And even now, after we've moved in she is still there, making this home buying experience something we will always cherish.
Thanks!<//Review>

This had to be one of my worse experiences with a rental company! Derrick Karimian is a joke and disrespectful monster. He was all buddy buddy when it came to me first renting the property but when it came down to the end of it he was plain rude and shady. I have always paid my rent on time, never rude and Respectful but they tried to cheat me. Do your self a favor and go far away from every one in Krystle Property! They have no souls, no respect for others, only want your money and will never help you. They are the absolute worse and tell you whatever you want to hear so they can get you to pay. I even complained to them to the Better Business Burue. Darren if your reading this learn how to respect and be ethical with others!< /Text>

These guy are the most Unprofessional/ Racist people in the world. I applied for a rental property and spoke with Abdul by the way i have a A1 credit 760 fico score And met all the requirements as directed, My house hold made over 6 times what the property monthly rental fees required and he said you are to young( 24 years old!)( My kid is your age!) Im a full time commercial Hazmat driver with a ton of professional references and he said i dont knoe let me talk to the owner...Rather than treating me as a equal applicant he Never processed my Application and said i cant come pick up the application, App Fees, Ect and that im not accepted????How? and why? Hmmm Maybe Due to the tone of my skin? Please Dont do any Buisness with these guys thats seriously unfair!<//Text>

Kathy the agent was very rude, first our appointment was at 2 but the first agent forgot the keys so we had to come back an hour later. When we came back at 3 no one was there and when they did arrive she made a face at me and worded something and just looked at me very rude.<//review>

DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! ABDUL & DERRICK ARE CROOKS, SCAMMERS, LIARS!
The manager, ABDUL KARIMIAN, spoke to me prior to my renting a 5 bedroom house in Vallejo. I had an 800+ credit score and plenty of money in the bank. I told him that my fiancé and I would like to have classmate roommates, as we were students and $2,400 a month was too expensive for us as we were both getting a double Master's Degree. He told me that it would be no problem to have roommates added onto my lease, and they could pay me and I could pay the rental company.  My lease said no subletting, so I triple checked with him that this would be ok, and he gave me his word. I asked for it in writing multiple times, and he said take my word, so I stupidly did. Biggest mistake of my life.

We had roommates for one year and everything went ok. One year into our lease, they moved out for medical rotations and we wanted to add new roommates. We went about the process as we did before, and as I had discussed with Abdul. We had each roommate fill out a rental application, background check, etc with Krystle Property. I had formed an agreement with each of them as to how much they had to pay me so that I could pay the rental company on time. One roommate emailed this agreement to Krystle Property. The next thing I know, a very angry, violent man is standing in my doorframe, screaming at me.

His name was DERRICK KARIMIAN and he was the son of Abdul. He didn’t knock, he just entered the opening of our house since the front door was cracked open. He yelled at the top of his lungs at my fiance, telling him that we had three days to correct this subletting or move out. I told him that I had spoken to his father and he had given me his word that it was ok. He said it didn’t matter. He utterly embarrassed me in front of our housemates and he sped away.

I called him a few hours later to give him time to cool down. He said that he wouldn’t allow us to take corrective action and we had to move out in three days. Three days to move out of a 5 bedroom house, to get it cleaned, to clean the carpet, and to pack meant no sleeping or eating and severe anxiety. There was no talking to Derrick, as he threatened to take legal action against us if we didn’t move. We packed, painted the house, went through inspections, cleaned the carpets, and had to have 2 current roommates who were on the lease move out as well. It was a disaster as we were in the middle of final exams for our Master’s degree.

They emailed our incoming roommates behind our backs (our incoming roommates were loyal and told us about this), telling them they were evicting us but would like them to sign onto a new lease with them. What crooks! They did this so that they could increase the rental price by $200 for my roommates. After doing everything they asked and leaving the place much better than they gave it to us, they had the nerve to charge us $100 to remove wood from the backyard that had been there when we moved in from the prior tenants. Lesson learned- DO NOT RENT FROM THIS SOULLESS COMPANY AND ALWAYS GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING!

Also, during our year living there, it took our toilet overflowing 3 times and our bathtub leaking down from upstairs down into our dining room for them to take action for maintenance we requested a long time prior. This company sends the cheapest maintenance people who are sometimes drugged and don’t know what they’re doing. STEER CLEAR OF THESE SCUMBAGS!</review>

<Text>The worst Property Management Company on the Planet.I had to call  and email repeatedly just to get a response.When I was finaly able to set up an appointment,things got even worst.I arrived at the office only to find out that their parking lot is only for thier employee's.They insist that thier client park on the streets.That set the tone for the customer service you will recieve.We were rushed through the application process,and was told that that one of the properties that we had agreed to view was unaviliable due to a plumbing problem.I was told that the tenats in the back unit was using the water in the front unit.The thing about this is number one a simple courtesy  call that the unit couldnt be view would have been nice,however these people have no clue on customer service.Secondly in their ad there was no mention of a secondary stucture or people living in it.The Agent said she would take us to a simlar property.She end up taking us to the worst part of Vallejo.The first apartment she took us to we could barely get into.The front stairs are a difinite safety hazard(By the agents own admission)The previous tenat was suprised by us visiting.The unit itself was full of code violations, uninhabitabal is how I would describe it.The next Apartment we viewed was even worst.The minute we opened the door an overpowering scent of mildew greeted us.As we further entered the apt.we were greeted with MOLD,in also every room.We left immediatly,We tried to ask the Agent questions however she basically threw the application at us and left.We went on to view another property they had listed by ourselves.Their ad listed it as a penthouse,what it really was ,was a ATTIC!!!!!!These people have no ideal of what customer service is,They are very deceptive in thier ads,and after dealing with these people and viewing thier properties,one word comes to mind......SLUM LORDS!!!!! stay away from this company.< /Text><userid>111342409030767300774< /userid>< GmapID>

My only complaint is that when I leave a message with someone to return my call, I would expect a return call on the same day.< /text>

<Text>Miko was clean and neat in both his appearance and work areas.  Took the time to explain his findings, offered suggestions and gave me options with no pressure. Very knowledgeable for someone with his limited age and experience.  Personally, if I should have future needs in other areas of plumbing, I would hope to have him service me again.  I'm confident that this issue has been permanently resolved.  Thanks< /Text><userid>117933881724778551256</userid>< time>

Excellent service. I waited a few days to complete the survey because I wanted to make sure the drain was truly cleared. Five days later, it’s absolutely cleared thanks to Jose Nunez. He was not only effective with his work but he was also professional. He explained what he was going to do and kept us informed. He came prepared for the job and came within the time frame I was told. We are very happy with the service we received and the outcome.<//text>

Steven from Roto Rooter came out to fix a leak under our kitchen sink. We recently had someone update our kitchen, who was great at making the counter and cabinets look nice, but was not skilled at plumbing and put everything back together improperly. Steven was extremely professional and knowledgeable. He walked us through every issue he found and clearly explained what needed to be fixed and replaced to get everything working properly again. He was efficient, timely and took extra steps to test everything when it was complete so ensure he was leaving everything in perfect working condition. I can't say enough good things about his work and his care in completing the job properly. We immediately felt that we were in good hands and are grateful for the fast response and awesome work he did.< /Text>

Ask for Stephen when you set up an appointment. My house was built in 1922 and has its share of quirks. Stephen worked tirelessly, lugging his heavy equipment from the first floor to the second floor to the basement and back to the 2nd floor until the clog was found and removed. He was very personable and professional and also very helpful in educating me each step of the process. I
highly recommend his expertise and energy no matter the age of your house, but particularly if it's as old as mine.
Five stars plus!< /review>

<Text>Michael Diaz was professional, personable, and provided good communication throughout his service visit. He took great care to ensure the job was done right and answered all of my questions. He cleaned up the area as well before leaving. Thank you very much for acting so quickly to address our drain problem. I appreciate the great service.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Steven came within 20 minutes of being called out to assess the cause of our flooded dining room. He persisted and explained all areas of the suspected leakage and why he was doing what he was doing. He finally found the source of our flood and was able to easily fix it. He was professional, communicative, and honest. He worked diligently to find the source of our leak.  Highly recommend.< /text>

He explained everything to me before he started. He was quick and had the most friendly attitude.  Everything is now in working order!!</Review>< name>

<Review>I had my shower backing up with water . The technician was professional and came in time. He worked really hard to fix the problem and then making sure that water is flowing without interruption  from
Shower area. They are not the lowest in price quoted, however I would rate them highest in the quality and value of work , professionalism , knowledge in figuring out the issue and time of warranty provided which ensures that they are confident of their work and issue will not recur during that long period of warranty.< /Review><name>Shaniba Ap</name>< time>

<Review>I had an audible alarm on my tankless water heater.  John was early to my appointment which was great, and gave me peace of mind that everything checked out just fine.  No water or gas leaks were present.  Must have been a software issue.  Great service thank you!<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
John Sigler  #7332 was very professional, he knew exactly what he was doing, he explained what and how he was going to perform his task. He went above and beyond to make sure faucets, spouts and drainage stoppers were installed properly. I highly recommend him if you have any plumbing issues.<//Review>

A different plumbing company came to my home in the morning and was unable to resolve a toilet issue.  I made an appointment with Roto Rooter and they arrived at my home within 2 hours of the appointment being scheduled.  Uni was very professional and explained the process and cost to resolve the toilet issue.  I agreed to proceed and she worked quickly and diligently to do the job, which included removing the toilet, clearing the lines, and remounting the toilet.  She also cleaned and disinfected the bathroom area when she finished, which was very nice.  I highly recommend Uni and Rooter Rooter for plumbing needs.</Review>

Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup was great!  Called me back within a few minutes and was able to make a same-day appointment for my backed-up mainline.  He was very thorough in explaining the problem and even showing me how he was fixing it with his cool camera.  is awesome and will be my go-to guy going forward.<//Text>

<Review>Our dismay when water from an upstairs shower (not to mention every other drain in the house) started flowing out through a downstairs toilet was quickly allayed by Rotorooter's promise to have a technician at our house within two hours. They did that. And this on a weekend. The technician, Uni (it says "A'ynis" on the paperwork), was terrific. She was professional, friendly, very competent, and very efficient. She cleared the drain line quickly, and gave a clear and realistic description of options if the problem recurs. We recommend her and her company highly, and will not hesitate to call them next time we have problems.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd796d9772c0d:0x3008fdabb2fa1756</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Every now and then I have to get the sewage drain from my house to the street cleared of tree roots, and Roto Rooter has always done a fantastic job. The most recent technician to take care of this issue, Mike, was incredibly courteous, professional, and personable. He arrived on time and took care of the issue quickly. Would definitely recommend Roto Rooter for all plumbing needs, and cannot commend Mike enough for his positive attitude and workmanship.<//review>

Byron was great!!! I called RotoRooter at 10:30am and they had someone out within the hour. I told the technician, Byron, what the issue was and he knew exactly where to go and what needed to be done to clear the clog. Now we are back to normal and moving about the day. Appreciate the work!!!< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Thank you Nicko for your quick, clean and knowledgeable work unclogging my kitchen sink.

He literally saved the day. My kitchen sink clogged at the worst moment. My husband was out of town and I was alone with my elderly father. I googled plumbers and clicked on a link. I’ve heard about roto rooter for years but never used them thinking they were very expensive.
The girl on the line said someone could come out right away but since it was late I decided to wait for the next day. Nicko showed up and in less than an hour he had finished the job, cleaned up after himself and my kitchen is back in action.
Oh and the cost was wayyyyy less than what I expected and they will come back within six months if the issue continues.

I WILL DEFINITELY USE ROTO ROOTER AGAIN!!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>Cleared tough clog in toilet line!!! Succeeded when Rooter Ranger failed (RAnger wanted to dig up floor for $4800 after refusing to try alternate Clean Outs

Jorge Bereijo with Rotor Rooted was extremely courteous and professional and new exactly how to solve the problem!

I really appreciated the job Jorge did.  Go for the pros, don’t waste time with amateurs and would be con-artists.< /text><date>1615780437236</date><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>Our toilet paper holder was accidently flushed and clogged. Since we only have one toilet, we called around 11pm - so grateful for the 24 hour service calls! Shortly after we called, A'ynis (Uni) showed up! She was super helpful and friendly. She explained everything clearly and we had a working toilet again! All of this, the call and repair, tooknplace within an hour. We are SO impressed with the service Uni and Roto-Rooter! Thank you! We will make sure to keep the lid shut next time we are changing the roll! Hehe!<//Review><date>1616170132588</date></record>

Loved the friendliness of the staff! Mallory was great, she was encouraging, detail oriented and gave the best care. Also loved Dr Allison, she was kind and took time to answer my questions in detail. Cleanliness of the clinic was excellent and safe! So glad to be a new patient at this place.< /review>

I’ve been with this dental office since I was referred by a coworker over a decade ago. I’ve had many dentists before and bounced around for a while... avoiding visits in general because I was either intimidated, uncomfortable with the staff, or miserable during treatment. And then I came here. Always friendly, warm and never stressful. They have the latest gadgets and the most comfortable chairs. I don’t have the dental problems I used to have because they ensure you are properly treated without going over the top. I look forward to coming each and every time. I moved to Orange County a few years ago and still the make the drive. Dr Lee and his staff rocks!< /text>

<Text>I am a new patient at Carmel Mountain Dental Care and felt compelled to write a review.  This is THE coolest dental office.  From the moment you walk in they make you feel at home.  (Literally, there's even a fireplace in the waiting room).  They take extra care of their patients to ensure safety and comfort before, during, and after the visit.  My hygienist was CJ and she was very pleasant, caring and knowledgeable, as were the rest of the staff I came into contact with. They have all the latest technology which just adds to their coolness factor and made my experience much more pleasant. Glad I found this place, highly recommend A+++< /Text>< Pics>

Best dental care ever. From the office staff to the hygienist to the dentist, everyone is always friendly, smiling, gentle and professional. They have a way of customizing your care by genuinely talking to you, asking what aspects are most important to you in regards to your dental care, showing & explaining things to you in detail, and being so personable & knowledgeable. My family fully trusts this team and we feel happy and lucky to have found them.<//review>

Going to the dentist regulary was not part of my childhood unless it was an emergency.  As an adult procedures have been traumatic and painful for me over the years. Yesterday was the first time I have felt cared about and understood.  I look forward to making positive steps towards healthier teeth and regular visits.

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my feelings and understand my history.  Overcoming my anxiety and fear of going to the dentist and trusting you is a big step for me.

I appreciate the kindness and gentle support of your team.<//text>

<text>Dr Lee is the most caring and friendly dentist. He is honest and knowledgeable, taking the time to explain the given situation and the viable options in an easy-to-understand manner. The staff members make you feel welcome from the moment you step through their office doors. And with as many patients as the office has, each associate makes it a point to remember who you are. Integrity, honesty, warmth, professional, and expertly-skilled are just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Dr. Jonathan Lee and his staff at Carmel Mountain Dental Care.<//text>< name>

I have been to this dental office for quite a few years. They have always been friendly, courteous, and professional. The environment is clean and the equipment is new. I first found I had high blood pressure here. Had my dentist not insisted that I had to lower my blood pressure before any dental treatment, I wouldn't bother to go to the doctor's office...Thinking back now, I do appreciate that advice.< /text>

They have an attractive and comfortable setting inside and out. Access to their facility at a major intersection was easy and convenient.  All their staff were friendly, eager to welcome me, to make me feel at home, and to answer my questions about my treatment, aftercare, and financial arrangements.  All-round, Carmel Mountain Dentistry provided a very pleasant experience!<//Review>

CJ was the one who did my dental cleaning. She’s thorough and very informative compared to my previous dental cleaning. She’s awesome with a very cheerful personality! I requested for her in my next appointment in October! The clinic is spot less and maintained in a very sanitary method. The staff are very friendly!< /Review>

My hygienist, Lisa, is the best!  She's very thorough and very friendly!  Dr. Lee is also very friendly and thorough and interested in answering any questions I might have.  I've been a patient of Dr. Lee ever since he started his practice at Carmel Mountain Dental Care.  I've been very pleased with the care, knowledge and professionalism that I've received there.</text>

Excellent service. Very professional team. They explained all the procedures being performed and the costs. During my visit, Dr. Lyles and team took care of my teeth and the made sure I was comfortable throughout the crown replacement procedure. I am very happy with my new teeth. 😁< /text>

Dr Lyles is great! Going to the dentist is literally my least favorite thing to do - because I love sweets! Dr Lyles is very gentle and thorough about explaining what to expect. I'll always go to her! Every dental assistant there is so nice and even the billing ladies are thorough and transparent which is better than I've had at other dentist offices! Top notch professionals all around.<//text>

This was my first dental appointment at this office and i thought the staff and clinic were fantastic! The clinic was clean, everyone wore PPE, and all equipment were sterilized immediately after each use.  It had been a while since I had gone to the dentist because of moving around so often (& because I get a little anxious at the dentist lol), but the staff made me feel welcomed. One thing that stood out to me was how proactive they were in asking what was important to Me, and made sure that their care aligned with my values: affordability and detailed information. I highly recommend this office too anyone seeking great dental services!< /review>

<Text>I am 67 years old and have been to many dentist throughout the years. Have had many root canals and crowns. Today I saw Dr. Jonathan Lee and he replaced a crown I had done just a few years ago (which is not old!) for a crown.
It was leaking and I even had some decay, it was the best experience I have had in a dental chair and the crown is beautiful ☺️. This office does the crown in one day which you will not have to put up with a temporary crown!
Thank you Dr. Lee< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< user>

I found Dr. Lee via Google search and Yelp. I think that I have been very fortunate to have Dr. Lee as my new primary dentist. He checked my teeth very thoroughly and carefully. His advice and recommendation for my dental care was very experienced and trustworthy.</Text>

They were fantastic. As a new patient they made me feel comfortable and asked me what I was most concerned about. The thing that blew me away that no dentist had done for me before was create a care plan that would take care of the most urgent teeth first so they don't create larger, more expensive problems. I'm really glad I looked this place up on Yelp.</text>

Wow. This dental office is super clean and super friendly employees and dentists. Their precautions with covid is top notch via screenings and onsite procedures. The equipment are state of the art with today’s technology. I didn’t feel the pressure of rushing me out for the next patient. I high recommend everyone and their kids to join this dental group.

The reason this dental office has so many reviews os because they are very pushy in asking for them. It barely has been four days from my first appointment and I already received at least 2 emails, 3 text messages, and a card in the mail asking to leave a review on Google. I don’t have anything particularly nice to say so wasn’t going to write anything, but since it does’t appear that the harassment for a review will stop unless I write something here it is. I had the initial new patient appointment only. The staff was nice, but they use « sweet » talk almost to the point that’s patronizing. The office was clean. The appointment was excruciatingly long.  The staff seemed very young and not experienced especially when after taking x-rays and pictures for over an hour she still could not tell how many fillings I had done previously. You are not told which dentist will be examining you. There is the usual deep cleaning sales pitch and a pitch to purchase their office « membership ». The teeth cleaning received was average at best.< /text>

My canal root treatment started very well. Staffs are very nice and professional and the state-of-art medical devices looked very impressive!
But at the very end, sanitizing solution overflowed throughout my mouth. It was very terrible experience. Still now, 5 days after treatment day, it is not comfortable.< /Text>

I remember being afraid of the Dentist since I was younger but everyone here makes you feel safe and taken care of so there is no reason to avoid future appointments.

Doctor Lyles  and many of the other staff also don't talk down to you if you haven't flossed in a while or have cavities as an adult. They simply say "Its ok, we will fix you right up!"

They also took major precautions during the Pandemic to protect their staff and their patients which puts my mind at ease.</Review>

<Review>I started going here as a kid back in 2004 and only stopped when I moved out of state. Now that I’m back I decided to do the in house dental plan they offer for myself and my family of 3 and couldn’t be more happy. They had a ballon and their friendly staff made my 2 year old feel so comfortable, she didn’t shed a tear or even fuss when they did the X-rays. My own experience was as good if not better. Turned out I had to get more than a cleaning (friendly reminder to floss your teeth daily) but it wasn’t so bad as they took care of it promptly in a shockingly painless filling!

Overall I have nothing but good things to say about the staff, their service and the environment too. Very cheerful and clean!</Review><gmapID>0x80dbf9d2ae0ada07:0x24e11cb25d9b15da</gmapID>< name>

Wonderful office/staff/Dentists, warm and friendly. I moved from OC and I researched and read reviews on dentists in the area and I'm glad to have selected Carmel Mntn Dentist. I had my cleaning yesterday and the hygienist was thorough. I appreciate a thorough hygienist as I love my 6 month cleaning-I look forward to them. I had to get some past fillings smoothed out and the Dentist addressed it immediately. She made sure I was satisfied before moving on. I never felt rushed. To be fair, I've seen a couple of Dentist's since I've been with CMD so this review is long overdue. (Wish I remembered their names) I would recommend CMD to anyone in the area.<//text>

< review>
First visit to Carmel Mtn Dental Care was impressive for two reasons. Dr Jade Lyles had (in a matter of two days,) received and reviewed my transfer records and x-rays and had contacted my periodontist regarding my partial implant history. (Partial was due to having to sadly replace primary care dentist.)

Dr Lyles made me feel extremely comfortable from the minute I sat down, she answered all my questions and provided the level of detail I needed for her proposed recovery plan.

I was equally impressed with the CMDC team which not only coordinated the transfer and receipt of my records, they had submitted and received pre-approval from my insurance plans which allowed Dr. Lyles authorization to move forward immediately on finishing the implant process.

Outstanding dentists and extremely competent support teams handling all aspects of the financial payments are fundamental to senior care patients on a fixed income.

Finding Dr. Lyles and CMDC clearly exceeded my high expectations. I believe I have replaced my “one of the very best” dentists with another “one of the very best!” Congrats and thank you to Dr. Jade Lyles and Carmel Mtn Dental Care. J. Serazio</review>

<Text>I have been going to Carmel Mountain Dental Care as long as I’ve had teeth and they never fail to provide quality, friendly and efficient treatment. Even as a little kid I always knew that the dentist was a fun place to go and that they would take care of me. I’ve been through countless cleanings, extractions, braces and Invisalign and I have been equally pleased every time. Any time I have a question or concern, they are fast to answer and provide care above and beyond my expectations. If you’re on the edge about picking them as your dentist, take it from a life long patient, they are the BEST!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1598419024568, 'text': 'Wow, Ashley!

If I could give 10 stars, I would. Communication is everything in this world and they are the best example of what all dentists (really all health care providers) should be. I was very scared to go because I don’t have dental insurance and it had been over 12 years since I had my teeth cleaned, but I was in good hands the whole time. Everyone I encountered was genuinely kind and my treatment was very thorough. They also have their own dental plan, which I highly recommend for anyone who doesn’t have dental insurance. So no more excuses, go get your dental health back on track!</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>First visit to this dental clinic because my dentist of over 15 years didn’t have enough capacity to fit me in once County restrictions opened up dental offices. Access as a new patient was within two weeks for this routine cleaning; there was great use of technology, communication, text messaging; also nice updated In line videos on what to expect with regards to new standards for hygiene and safety. I had a thorough exam, cleaning and evaluation, including physical exam, x-rays, and photography of some concerned areas which were easily shown in the large monitor in front of me. Throughout the process all staff members were attentive to hygiene to keep both me as well as them safe during my visit. I was very pleased with all office staff, including my dental hygienist Maryann, and Dr. Moeckel.

Looking forward to future visits, thank you very much for a great experience!< /text>< date>

< Review>
Going to the dentist is not my favorite thing but I was very impressed with the sensitivity and expertise demonstrated by Marianne, Dr. Lyles & her assistant.
In spite of the fact that I needed some serious work done, it was all so much more pain-free than I anticipated!  What a relief to be in such good hands!!

Not sure why this appears to be posting from Garrick Pridemore. I am Heather Edwards - this was my experience at Carmel Mountain Dentistry.</Review>

Dr Lee is the best dentist ever for me and my family. He and his personals are very professional, kind and caring. Before I used to have some problems with my dentists such as appointments issues, severe tooth aches and infection. Now since I am under the care of Carmel Mountain dental care I have none of those issues. I trust them and it’s blessing to have them.< /review>

<review>Dr. Lee’s office is the best! I have been to many dental offices over the years and and none of them have had personal experience like Dr. Lee’s has had. He has a fantastic group of hygienists that are very friendly and very conversational they make you feel right at home. The office is extremely clean makes you feel comfortable and keeps a smile on your face. No pun intended. I’ve been going there for three years now and unless I move out of state I am not switching dental offices.

Plus, they have super fun holiday festivities ;)</review></record>

<Review>I rarely write reviews but felt like i had to because we finally found a dental home! CMDC literally checks off everything we want in a dental office.

Covid precautions/management: check in was so easy and clear.  you call, they text you to come to the designated area where your temp is taken and hand sanitized.  everything in the clinic is spotless and high frequency touch areas covered with disposable plastic.  molekule air purifiers all around.

Darla/scheduling:  she was the first person who i talked to at this office and from the start she made me feel like i was a part of the family.  so friendly, thorough and helpful.  she helped me reschedule to an earlier day because i was having pain.

Marianne/hygienist:  so thorough yet efficient in her work also very detailed in providing explanations....but only if you want all the details as she gives you the choice.  my teeth feel super clean!  she went above and beyond to cooordinate with a colleague so that it would be timed efficiently and minimize my wait time.  I learned a lot about my teeth from her!

Dr Lee/Dentist:  i really believe he creates and sets the culture for this clinic.  He’s personable, super kind, cares for your dental and overall health and seems that his colleagues and employees really respect him.  He examined and gave a really helpful assessment of my dental health and had great advice.

Insurance and costs:  this is the part that gives me the most stress going to the dentist.  but i greatly appreciate that you have the choice to have the office bill the insurance company first.  i have been to super high end dental offices that dont give you that choice and they have you pay up front.

thanks CMDC!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1600880779363, 'text': "Eric, few reviews are as thoughtful and comprehensive as yours.

Even in the midst of the virus and CDC regulation for dental facilities, I felt protected and happy I went.

<review>If there is such a thing as overpreparing after COVID-19, Dr. Lee and his team at CMDC have gone above and beyond to make their patients feel safe and that their well being is first and foremost. I am so appreciative of the team’s care and diligence in taking care of my family’s dental needs every single visit. Nothing unnecessary is ever recommended. They really do treat you the way they would if one of their family members was in that patient chair.</review>< Response>

<Text>The person who did the dental cleaning needs to be retrained.  She does not know how to correctly clean.  She is trying hard, but did the wrong way.  She needs to clean the teeth but not leave a lot of scratches on teeth. It will build up plaques easily if like the way she did.  I feel sorry for her as she does not realize she did it wrong.   I think the boss or the person who hired her did not watch her closely or train her.  I have been to many dental clinics in other states, they all did a great Job.  She is the second one in San Diego I met who did a poor job.  Her hand is not gentle. Although Dental cleaning is not hard, dental hygienists should be trained in the correct way.  Please do not hire someone who has not been trained or not trained in a wrong way.  This is a terrible experience!!< /Text><Date>1576645018127</Date><rate>1</rate><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

I just moved to SD about 8 months ago and was looking for a dentist and my girlfriend recommended me to go here and she said the customer service was on point and I have to say that I completely agree. From the moment I walked to the front desk and until the end, it was such an amazing experience. I've had the same dentist for basically my whole life and I was use to just low-tech equipment and long waiting times, but man I have to say Dr. Lee is running a tight ship. This place has very up-to-date technology and equipment and I was incredibly impressed with it all! This place is very detail-oriented in its customer service and every little detail makes such a big difference in the whole experience. I wasn't surprised that the place was booked up. I also liked that they didn't try to sell me anything or push too much on selling services and just went straight to the point and only did what was covered under my insurance, which is all I wanted.

My hygienist Christine did an amazing, thorough job and not only that she was very nice to talk to. She was very genuine and kind and made me feel very welcomed. I was so use to my old hygienist, who would just hurt my teeth most of the time and I was never really sure if she was doing a good job, but Christine not only made my teeth feel very clean after, it was painless and relaxing!

I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique dental experience!< /text>

I can’t say enough about how awesome this place is. I’ve been terrified of the dentist since I was a child and it wasn’t until I found Carmel Mountain Dental Care that my “dentist anxiety“ is completely gone. Lisa is my hygienist, she has helped me do a complete 180 in regards to my dental health. Anytime I have had dental work done, beyond cleanings, Dr. Lee has gets the job done quickly and 100% pain free.</review>

Consistent, impeccable service and care from the front desk receptionist, seeing the dental hygienist to having the dentist consult (and final check-up) at the end. Lisa and Dr. Lee were honest and quick with their dental care for my visit today. They were able to squeeze me in last minute which I really appreciated. My husband and I have been going here for years and have always left Carmel Mountains Dental Care with a smile on our faces. We highly recommend that you and your family come here for your dental needs. You will not be disappointed.<//text>

They have fun give aways, and my teeth have never looked better. I see Dr. Le but I have seen other doctors on occasion and they have all been great.

Great job today on cleaning my teeth, they never felt or looked better. I’m so glad I started going to You guys, the staff is awesome, you have such modern technology. In the two years I’ve been going to Carmel Mountian dental Care I bet I added years of life to me teeth. ‍Dr. Moeckel is the best! Her and her team make it so much fun I forgot for a sec I was even at the dentist! Thanks again!< /Review>

If you are looking for a caring, friendly, and knowledgeable dental office, LOOK NO FURTHER! Instantly I felt very comfortable in their beautiful office and was greeted warmly by the staff. The office is immaculate and bright with nice decor.
Dr. Lee was able to fix a filling replacement that was bothering me quickly and pain-free. I have had a few cleanings with a couple of hygienists as well, and they always let me choose the music or TV show I wanted. Mandy was incredible. She was very sweet and very skilled. My gums didn't hurt at all! She had tons of info and was very detailed in teaching me preventative measures I never was told before! I plan on telling my friends about this place, especially the ones not too keen on dentists.</Review>

My hygienist was spot on and very quick and did a great job. My dentist , Dr Moeckle was on time and made great suggestions. I was given a good exam and clear roadmap . The receptionist was cheerful and sweet. Kudos to Maryann for helping with my plan and dealing with all the red tape . What a great team!<//Review>

<Text>I for one will avoid the dentist at all costs!
If there's no pain, I'm good, no need to see a dentist.
Stupid logic, I know.

Being in the dentist chair makes me feel anxious. The whole thing about someone being all up in my face just makes me feel weird. But Carmel Mountain Dental and the entire staff are extremely professional, comforting and attentive. They do all they can in their power to make sure each visit is a good one. On top of that, they do great work. My teeth feel so nice and clean after each visit. They educate me on proper hygiene and techniques.

Can't say enough great things. I, without any hesitation, recommend them!</Text></record>

This is the most amazing dentist office. Everything from the receptionist to the doctor was 5 star. The best part was the hygienist Lauren!  She was kind and took time to explain things and answers all of my questions. Lauren was gentle but perfectly efficient. I so appreciate the care and would highly recommend this office!</review>

<Review>Great office! The staff and doctors there are very friendly and treat you with utter most care. I’m a new patient to the office and when I came in for my first visit, they made me feel right at home with a welcome gift, drink and a few other goodies.

The facilities are nice and clean with the latest advancements to make you feel at easy when sitting in the chair. They even have Netflix for you to watch if you want some entertainment during your appointment.

Would recommend others that are looking for a dentist to check this practice out. They take care of all ages and various treatment cases.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1561396353061, 'text': 'Thank you for your thoughtful review, Benjimin.

Myself and my son agreed that this was the BEST experience we've had going to the Dentist.
The staff was professional, respectful, knowledgeable and had genuine, positive energy from the Receptionist to the Hygienist.   The Hygienist really took the time to review my medical history, ask questions and follow through with
Dr. Lee  who is awesome!  They have a great systematic process in place.
Carmel Mountain Dental Care is our new home.  Thank you to the team who made us feel very comfortable on our first visit.  Keep up the great work!< /Review>

My family has been going to carmel mountain dental care for years. Their customer service has been going down hill ever since Dr. Marissa Lee left the practice.
They often over book patients that caused long delays. The waits are often over 40 minutes past the original appointment time. They did not call me back when they said  they were going to call back with answers to my questions. And sometimes, there seems to be disconnects between the office coordinators and the doctor. Because the doctor sometimes doesn't even know what I went in for when I sat in the operating chair. Furthermore, I feel that the doctor (I'm not going to name names here) is rushing through procedures and not providing the care that patients need. There are plenty of qualifying dentists in the area. What made your practice stand out was your customer service.
Please place more focus on providing your patients with better customer service. Since that is the main reason that many of us picked your practice in the first place.< /text>

<Review>WOW!!!, is one of many expressions you can have after visiting Carmel Mountain Dental Care. I’m 63 now and probably would not have all my teeth had I not by the grace of God discovered this office. Immediately I was made aware that I had peridontal disease... Lauren, the Dental Hygienist, and Dr. Jonathan Lee have saved my teeth an helped me continue my life with much healthier Dental Habits and all around care. If you want Dental Care that is second to none then visit Carmel Mountain Dental Care. 😎❤️✌🏽🙏🏽<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1552672651440, 'text': 'Sean, we are grateful for your very generous comments.

Smiles all around. They all express interest in the patient starting with Dr. Lee. Current tools and applications. Dr Lee gives you options. Staff knows what is covered by your insurance and discusses it with you . Great service.  We selected Carmel Mountain Dental Care when our prior dentist retired and could not be happier .

Once again, the service and people at Carmel Mountain Dental Care are great.  Dr. Lee and staff are really concerned about your health and welfare.  Dr. Lee and staff are helpful explaining services and addressing questions.  I definitely recommend Carmen Mountain Dental Care.<//review>

Staff is super friendly and they definitely take their time to make sure that you understand what process you will be going through and to make you feel comfortable in knowing just what they are doing. Their communication is great and I don't feel as if they try to find problem areas in your mouth just to make some money to "fix" it like plenty of dentists I have been too. Their office is neat, organized and clean and their technology is top notch!<//Text>

<review>Love, love, LOVE Carmel Mountain Dental. I’m a nervous patient and hate getting my teeth cleaned but everyone at CMD is so sweet and I’ve never had a bad experience. The gals here always offer me headphones and Netflix to distract me, and they never rush through a cleaning or leave my gums sore. Would recommend for anyone that has sensitive teeth or general anxiety about dental work.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

My experience today was exactly what I've come to expect when I walk into Carmel Mountain Dental Care, top notch.  The positive atmosphere from the moment you walk until you leave from the entire staff, makes you feel welcome. Ronica was a pleasure to talk to while waiting for my crown to be made and did a great job assisting Dr. Lee in changing my pirate smile into one I'm proud of.  Dr. Lee is always up beat, very thorough and the best dentist I have ever encountered. That is why I've kept coming back for the last 10 years. I highly recommend Carmel Mountain Dental Care.</Text>

<Review>I feel obligated to write this review based on my own experience, because I was misled by the good reviews here.

My old onlay (similar to a crown) fractured recently and my previous dentist unfortunately passed away, so I had to look for a new one. I went to this dental office because of their 5 star Yelp/Google reviews. What a mistake. The new onlay I got from them was a bad fit with gaps and sensitivities. In addition, the procedure caused three painful mouth sores on my gums. Now I have to go to another dentist to have it redone.

They have a CEREC machine that can make an onlay or crown in 2 hours. I was skeptical but the dentist assured me that the fit should be more precise than the traditional lab-made one. It is not.

Just as most reviews have already mentioned, their dentists are nice individuals. So are the front desk team and dental hygienists. But what I need the most for my onlay are hard dental skills and attention to detail, which unfortunately are what they lack.

During my onlay procedure, the dentist seemed to be attending other patients at the same time (similar to an assembly line), popping in and out, leaving me with his dental assistants. During his absence, the assistant proceeded to work on my onlay and rescanned my tooth, because the first scan done by the dentist was a mismatch. Neither the dentist nor the assistants explained to me what was going on. I felt the entire procedure was in a rush.<//Review><rating>1< /rating><date>1576168815006< /date>< Name>

I normally dread going to the dentist (don't we all) but my experiences at Carmel Mountain Dental Care have always been very positive.  Great staff, friendly atmosphere, and comfortable setting.  All the doctors and technicians have been very good to me, even with some major work done I have never felt any pain or discomfort.  I definitely recommend them to everyone.</text>

<Text>I was searching for a dentist in our area; it was kind of an emergency. My husband had a toothache and was in excruciating pain. I looked online and found many dentists with 1 star reviews. I was discouraged but came across Carmel Mtn Dental. It had 5 star reviews! Yes! I called them first thing in the morning and they were able to see my husband the same day. Even better, they treated his problem too.  No coming back a second time- and it was a pretty extensive treatment... They also fit me in for a cleaning that day. The staff made me feel comfortable the moment we walked in. They were very personable, friendly and attentive, making sure all my needs were met. The Dental Hygenist was very knowledgeable and thorough. The dentist was gregarious and very detailed with my treatment plan. They accommodated all my needs and made sure I was in good hands. I highly recommend this dental office. You can’t find very many trustworthy dentists these days and they definitely gained my trust . They have achieved all my expectations and then some! My husband was very impressed too!<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I leave this dental office feeling like I just left a spa! Everything/everyone here is above and beyond. I am taken care of with the greatest care and kindness and always showered with compliments. Juilette spent extra time cleaning my teeth to make sure every little piece of gunk was off my teeth to the extent that my teeth have never looked and felt so perfect. She answered everyone of my questions, and gave me more information than i even knew was out there about how to take care of my teeth! They do everything to make sure you are comfortable by offering blankets, free chapstick, watch your favorite Netflix show and so so much more! If you want the best care and beautiful teeth, this is where to go! I’ll never go anywhere else after the special care I received here!<//Review>

I love Dr. Lee and his entire dental team! I never thought I would say such a thing but I seriously have never seen a dental office so clean, nicely decorated and fully stock with high end equipment. They really go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and that you have a positive experience. They offer you music, tv, blanket, chapstick...and anything else to relieve the stress and tension from having to get your teeth cleaned or worked on. It’s just really refreshing to see everyone always smiling...you really get the feeling that they all love what they do. It took my husband over 2 years to start coming here himself because his brother was a dentist and was going to him instead but now my husband is a believer and sees why I speak so highly of Dr. Lee and his team. I go here for my routine cleanings and have gotten all my silver fillings replaced. They were really good with making sure I maximize: my insurance benefits and that I didn’t leave any money on the table, so to speak, and to pay as little out of pocket as possible. I appreciate their honesty and not taking advantage of me and recommending unnecessary work to be done on my teeth. I really feel like they have my best interest at heart. Thank you to everyone there...I always look forward to my next appointment!<//text>

Eliza is a great hygienist with Doctor Jonathan Lee. They greet you with smile and enthusiasm that makes your day. Always polite and courteous since the very start I've known them including the staffs for the last 13 years. We highly recommend them with relatives and friends. Get out from their office with a smile.< /text>

Dr. Jonathan Lee and his staff are amazing!  They teamed up with Operation Gratitude to donate candy and thank you cards to military personnel.  I am a parent volunteer at Morning Creek Elementary School and the entire staff was so supportive and helpful.  It was a pleasure working this wonderful group of people!!</review>

Best office thus far. It's not freezing cold. Staff are very personable. You can watch tv in your own chair, World Cup Semi-Finals in my case. Their equipment/technology is current. X-rays are simple and easy; no more biting down on a hard squarish film that pokes the inside of your mouth while using your hand to hold the clamp...< /Text>

I decided to take a look on Yelp & Google, and came across Dr Lee. I have to tell you, I really got lucky. He had great reviews, and now I know why. I broke a tooth and it needed a crown. The staff was very friendly, they fit me right in so he could take a look. Roughly 2 hours later I had my crown, and he did an excellent job. The tooth looks and feels like my natural tooth. NO PAIN AT ALL! The shot didn't even hurt! The break was close to the nerve but since he's such an expert he didn't think I would need a root canal, and he was right. He could have sold me on a root canal to make more money but he's very honest. He said only do what needs to be done.
Prep time for the tooth was only about 15-20 minutes and gluing the crown  really didn't take much time at all. I spent most of the time relaxing  in the chair, watching a TV show, waiting for the crown to be made.
I'm very happy, and will continue to use Dr. Lee and staff @ Carmel Mountain Dental Care. Thanks Dr Lee and Staff!!</Text><name>RRusso</name>< rating>

< review>
I had an exceptional experience as a first time customer. I never thought a dental office could be so updated in terms of technology, entertainment trends and online social awareness. You can tell by reading the other reviews that they really take the time to reach out to every customer, if it's your first time you are greeted with gifts and friendly staff. When I walked in they had just finished a staff appreciation party, and that to me shows they care about you as much as they care about each other. My first dental exam was conducted by Juliet, she was knowledgeable and provided great information on my current dental health and tips on how to change bad habits. I was then seen by Dr. Saade and Mariana for some dental work and wow, they work quick and are very precise, they set me up with a netflix show to watch and I barely made it through one episode! Everyone I interacted with was so friendly and their communication throughout the office is superb, I came in for a check up and got work done the same day!</review>

<name>Margaret Casarez< /name><Rating>3</Rating><Review>Dental hygienist was great! However, disappointed that I was not told, in advance, that the dentist wouldn't be in until the afternoon. I should have been given the option  to reschedule my cleaning appointment to when the dentist was in. I always schedule both cleaning and examination appointments together. So now, I'll have to schedule another appointment for the examination. That is not the most efficient use of my time. I wish they would have been more respectful of my time. Other than that, great place.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dbf9d2ae0ada07:0x24e11cb25d9b15da</GmapID><response>None</response></record>

Our  family switched dentist to come to Carmel Mountain  Dental Care.  We love the friendly atmosphere, professional expertise and latest dental technology. We really appreciate that there is no one pushing to sell you extra services or unnecessary procedures as many dentists are doing these days.  Everyone from the front desk, dental hygienists and dentists are extremely caring, attentive and take time with each patient.  They do fun monthly raffle contests and have a positive team atmosphere.<//Text>

I had my third visit today with Carmel Mountain Dental Care. Like most people, I dread going to the dentist. The experience today has changed my outlook. The staff was very courteous and seemed to genuinely care. They take time to get to know you and spend quality time explaining everything in great detail. As long as I continue going to this dentist office, I'll no longer dread these visits. Good Job CM Dental Care!!!< /Text>

<Text>I’ve had some horrible dental experiences and my first time in Carmel Mtn Dental Care I was blown away by the customer service I received! I fully felt cared for and that my needs from a dentist were met. More than that, my last visit needed to be rescheduled due to a previous patient emergency. CMDC went above and beyond and gave me an Amazon gift card since I needed to reschedule for week later and sent a personal email to apologize for the inconvenience. No matter where I live in San Diego county I will ALWAYS go to this dental practice. Not only are they the best dentist I’ve been to, they are the best medical office I’ve ever been to! Highly highly recommend all of them!</Text>< Pics>

I was pretty disappointed with my previous dentists and was looking for a new one. My husband found them online and we both had appointments about a month ago. We were impressed with the staff members, Dr. Saade, service and the facility. Very very friendly and professional. I went back again yesterday to have my wisdom teeth removed. I was a bit nervous at first but Dr. Saade and Mariana were so patient and empathetic. Dr. Saade removed my teeth in 30 mins. My face came back to normal after 3 hours later. I don't feel much pain and it was such a great experience. Definitely recommending this place to my friends.</text>

I always have the best experience at CMDC. They offer so many things to make you more comfortable as they understand exactly how you feel when you sit in that chair. Water, blanket, lip balm, you name it they have it all for you! I never waited more than 5-10 mins for my appointment. I walk in, check in, sit down for few minutes, then they call my name. Even when they are busy, no staff seems rushed or frustrated. Everybody always has a big smile on them.

Mandy (my dental hygienist) is awesome! She explained everything from cost, process, and set up multiple appointments so that I can save time, money, and a headache! I had three visits in total for my fillings, deep cleaning part 1 and 2. She was my dental hygienist for all of those appointments. I love that they care about continuum of care because it is not fun to have a different person every time you go in. I highly recommend CMDC!</text>

<Date>1490595253330</Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Finally, my husband and I have found a dental office we can trust!!!
Dr. Jonathan Lee and his staff are the best dental team we’ve ever had, not only friendly but they are professional and knowledgeable. And, besides being extremely professional, they are on the cutting edge of the newest technology in dentistry, I was impressed with it!!

After a bad experience with another dentist, Dr. Lee and his staff helped me fix the issue which I had with work done by another dentist. I had to get an old crown replaced because has fell out and I gotten it 7 months ago, and with this new technology they used a tiny camera to create a three-dimensional image of the tooth which is transmitted to a machine that mills the crown from a chunk of ceramic and it was ready in one hour to be glued in my mouth. I love my new crown, it fits perfectly and looks good!

We have been very impressed by the level of care and caring shown by the entire office. If you are seeking dental care, just meet with Dr. Lee and see how you feel afterward.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I've been looking for a dentist in San Diego for quite some time. I decided to try Carmel Mountain Dental Care based on the Yelp reviews and the fact that they accepted my dental insurance. All the new patient paperwork was extremely easy and all done online so when I got to my appt all I had to do was check in.

I got called in right away and Lauren was amazing. Super easy to talk to and extremely gentle with the X-rays and teeth cleaning. I like how she showed me before and after pics of my teeth cleaning and seeing the difference made me appreciate the dentist office that much more. Dr Lee was easy going and straight to the point when it came to what needed to be done on my teeth. It was obvious from the X-rays so I didn't feel like he was making anything up (because there are some dentists that do that to make extra money).

Overall I had a great initial experience and am scheduled to come back for a crown and cavity fill. Hopefully that goes well!!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
We've (my husband and I) have been coming here for about 5 or so years now and we love the care and service we get from Dr. Lee and his staff. We actually moved and no longer live close to the practice but we have no plans to switch dentist because we love it that much. It's worth driving that extra 25 minutes to see him and his staff. Call us crazy, but I think the many positive reviews from other people speak volumes as well.< /Review>

Carmel Mountain was very accomodating with changing my appointment in a short period of time.
I was not sure that I would get another appointment seeing that it was so late on the year. (Thanksgiving)

I had fantastic treatment today at CMDC (as always)! Today I saw Lauren K. for my hygiene appointment and she was so great I literally almost fell asleep during my cleaning 😱 I got to enjoy one of my fave shows on Netflix as well. Dr. Lee was friendly & informative as always! Got to see my cavity on the big screen and although horrifying I know I'll be in good hands getting my filling done next week. Didn't even feel like I was at the dentist! Thanks all!< /text>

<Text>I have a hard time trusting "businesses", so after my dentist retired after being with him for over a decade, I was unhappy and uncomfortable about having to find a new dentist. Dr. Lee and his team are very professional, honest and friendly, so they soon won my trust. They never recommend or scare you into any unnecessary treatments, instead, partnering with you on your dental care.</Text>< resp>

I've been a patient at CMDC for 1.5 years now, and have had three cleanings, one minor filling, and one extraction. They consistently provide exceptional patient care from the moment I walk in to the moment I walk out. For my extraction, I requested an explanation of my insurance benefits and out of pocket fees beforehand. Darla, the treatment coordinator, responded to me within a timely manner and made sure to confirm this with me again prior to the procedure. Furthermore, I was extremely nervous the day of my appointment, but each person went out of their way to ensure that I was comfortable. I really wish I remembered everyone's name but just know that no matter who you see at Carmel Mountain Dental Care, you'll be  well taken care of. Thank you to the knowledgable staff and exceptional doctors for changing my outlook on dentist appointments! You have a patient for life.</Text>

My daughters and I became new patients to Dr. Lee in 2011. When we moved more than 45 mins away in 2013 I continued to drive the extra miles to remain in the care of Dr. Lee and his staff. So thankful for such great experiences and thorough care with this team. Best dentist I've ever had. Thank you, Carmel Mtn Dental Care!< /text>

You can't ask for a better dental experience. I felt like they cared about my physical comfort as well as emotional. I dread going to the dentist but since you have to go at least twice a year it should be here. The hygienists aren't just skilled but they're all nice. My teeth felt so clean and not all raw feeling like less skilled hygienists. Dr. Lee is also very skilled and didn't have to numb my entire face like many dentists do. Dental work is never fun but, again, if you need it done you should go here.< /Text>

After going through a number of dentists having work for the military, this has been the best dental office I have ever attended and plan to stay. Most dentists usually are absent in the front desk, but this place has not one but TWO front desk. You’re immediately greeted and acknowledge by several team members along with a gift bag. Process/questionaire in regards to insurance information and personal information can be filled out prior to appointment online which is super convenient and easy to access, on top of that, a team member gives you a tour of the facility to make you feel comfortable and aware of the surroundings which is often overlooked upon. I had the pleasure of getting my dental work done by Lisa Hundley who is an extraordinary hygienist and was very detailed while keeping me entertained with netflix and good conversation. 5/5 rating from me! BDE : best dentist ever!<//Text>

Finding out the day you go in is wasting my time and yours. Then not being able to do anything to help you (even when your in pain) makes a person very upset.Don't understand why they couldn't just call my Dr. while I was there (maybe they where to busy)? Didn't even get to see the Lee doctors, saw some other lady. Not the warm fuzzy feeling when you dislike the dentist to begin with.

I just moved to San Diego and went to this office for the first time. Customer service was on point from the phone call to make the appointment to the explanation of services for my next visit to get some dental work done. Everyone from the receptionist to the doctor were super friendly and genuine in understanding your needs and explaining solutions.

One thing that stuck out that I have never seen a medical office do before was try to understand the person's personality through a brief questionare so they can communicate and deliver solutions with that person according to what personality type they are dominate in. The staff truely does care enough to get to know the patient and makes them feel comfortable even though they are at the dentist. They even put on a movie while waiting for the doctor onto a montor in front of the dentist chair. Would definetly recommend for a comfortable experience!< /Review>
