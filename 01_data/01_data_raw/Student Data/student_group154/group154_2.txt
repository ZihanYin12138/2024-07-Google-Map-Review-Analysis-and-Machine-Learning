The empanadas are amazing, and the service is even better. I haven't tried the rest of their menu, but please support this business, I'm sure it worth your time. Being a part time delivery driver, they treat us dasher with respect, no thumbing their nose at you.<//Review>

One star for the empanadas, they are delicious but pretty expensive. I tried the mix ceviche, seafood taste old with lots of lemon but flavor far from Peruvian style, again too expensive for the portion ( appetizer size)Also, I order the lomo saltado, expensive, salty, nothing out or the ordinary. In conclusion, I will not go back even for the empanadas<//text>

LOVE IT!
I'm Peruvian and have been living in the bay for a few years now, I've been to multiple Peruvian restaurants around the bay and none of them really took me back to Peru until I found Mistura. This restaurant is amazing! I have been ordering mamy times now and I have been in love all those times. Their food is on spot! Their plates have a good price, look great and have the best taste. And last but not least the service, they are very kind and very helpful. If you are looking for authentic Peruvian food this is your place.</text>

<Review>Delicious food, friendly service, and the beverage that is made with limes, pineapple, and purple corn is simply 🤯.

I had the rotisserie chicken, which was bomb, but the star is this dish I found to be the sauce that they coated my roasted vegetable side with. It was about on that “to die for” level.

The gf had the pollo saltado and she was a fan of the chicken, lightly fried fries, and THE SAUCE.

Would certainly recommend when you need your Peruvian fix. Irene (our server) was awesome! Can’t wait to go back next time I’m in Piedmont.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1603220522357, 'text': 'Thank you for the review'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80857df82fd6f4fb:0x62e0f7fab6915c55<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Great Peruvian rotisserie chicken! Just as good as Límon in SF. For $17, you can get half a chicken with two sides and an array of sauces. This is enough to feed 2 depending on how hungry you are. If you want a whole chicken, it’s $26. The sauces are so good and take the chicken to the next level. Make sure to ask for the hot sauce!</Text>< rating>

Well-executed and made with care. I personally have a thing for paper thin red onions - and these are dressed in lime juice. A perfect counter point to the lamb and beans. Mistura's rotisserie chicken is also a solid choice. Loved the plantains. Next, I want to try one of the empanadas,  or the chicken in walnut curry sauce, or their lomo saltado a beef dish. Irene is welcoming, warm and genuine. For reasonably priced, well-made food check Mistura out.</Review>

Loom salgado was overcooked,  And they won't substitute the rice and French fries that come with it for one of their healthier sides. My friend got the chicken and that was quite good,  It had a nice spice rub, and was cooked well. The whole place smelled like Greece and left your clothes smelling that way as well.< /Text>

<Review>Always an excellent neighborhood gem!  Mistura serves excellent food without pretentiousness... very straight forward and very very yummy!  Their signature roasted chicken is out of this world, but lately I discovered their Aji Gallina, which is like a Peruvian curry... it's awesome!  I recommend to add the vegetables to any dish you get and for starters, the fried yucca!  The owners are usually at the location... introduce yourselves!  They are very friendly and love to hear from their customers.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< review>
We came on a Monday afternoon right before they close at 2:30 and I walked and made sure it was fine for us to still come in and have lunch.

The hostess/waitress was very friendly and welcoming that she told us "sure come'on in".

We knew what we wanted and placed our orders. The food arrived within 15 minutes and was very delicious.

Irena kept checking on us for redills on beverages and if we needed anything else.

This will be our to go spot.< /review>

< Review>
This was my first time here and I gotta say it was great! It opened at 5:30pm. The half chicken was delicious. The drinks were great too!
The set up is very cool, Nazca lines!!!
Price is mildly higher, but the food balances that out.
Staff was friendly and service was fast!!!</Review>

Absolutely stunning place! From the food, to atmosphere and people - I loved it all! This is one of the only places where you know you getting authentic Peruvian food!
Their rotisserie chicken is unmatched!
Our server was Irene! Her customer service is sublime! I am coming back again soon!<//Review>

We have been going to Mistura since it opened.  We always enjoy the food and talking with the very nice owners and staff.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Go with the rotisserie chicken and sides.  It feeds 2-3 people.  I wish every restaurant in Oakland was like this one.< /Text>

We had a variety of their food, it was good, but for the price could have eaten better somewhere else.  However, the best thing about this place is that they had tasty rotisserie chicken. If that was all I wanted to eat, I'd go back again.<//Review>

I loved this place, but I think they have potential to do better. The chicken was absolutely amazing. The two vegetable dishes are too small so I had to order both.  The spinach & feta salad was heavy on the salty / briny flavors for my taste, but that could also be because I refrain from eating any sugar and so had to forgo the vinaigrette that it comes with. The servers were total sweethearts and the place was totally charming, just hoping they add some veggies!</Text>

My new favorite for Peruvian. The roasted chicken was moist, flavorful, and the skin, crisp. The Lomo Saltado was the best I've ever had. Prior to coming here, Peruvian was not high on my list of favorites, but this restaurant has changed that. The service is attentive and friendly. The prices are average for the area. Don't hesitate to go!< /Text>

It was good, but not great and somewhat overpriced for what we got. We had the quinoa and goat cheese salad - nothing special. Plantains - good, $5 for 4 slices. I had the chicken and my friend had the vegetables. Overall nice quiet place good for a conversation over a meal but I probably wouldn’t go back for the food.< /Text>

<review>•The "Lomo Saltado" was delicious!! One of the best Lomo Saltados I have tried in Peruvian restaurants within the Bay Area. If you would like to pair it with a red wine, I extremely suggest you to order a glass of "Sunce Zinfandel" or "Sunce Syrah" red wine from the Menu.

•The "Rotisserie Chicken" was okay, that's my opinion as a Peruvian who has lived its entire life in Peru, but I can't say that it was bad. You are going to like it whether you are Peruvian or not. If you are Peruvian, don't expect the "Rotisserie Chicken" to taste or be like a true "Pollo a la Brasa" from Peru.<//review>< pictures>

Great options  for Peruvian delights. It can get a little pricey but, you can share a lot of items, still have plenty to eat and save a few $< /Review>

This small gem stole my heart when it came to the service! Very welcoming and attentive people - at the end of our dinner, the waitress brought us lucuma(Peruvian fruit) ice cream as a compliment something that I was not even expecting. The service was above and beyond our expectations.</Review><user_id>117933896755833554278</user_id>< user_name>

Servings looked small but were VERY filling. Lomo saltado was to die for and the quality of the meal was amazing. My boyfriend and I have been trying out the lomo at each Peruvian place we go searching for the best one and this is definitely a contender! Also they just got a beer on tap and it was delish. Service is also amazing!<//review>

Exquisite delicious Peruvian food. Nice ambience and friendly staff. Good quality food (organic and no gmos) for the price. Make sure to try the ceviche and seco de cordero for authentic Peruvian dishes. Of course the rotisserie chicken and sides are finger licking good. Don't forget the crema volteada for dessert with authentic Peruvian coffee. I have been here lots of times and am never disapointed.</Text>

Excellent Peruvian food.  The Pollo a la Brasa (marinated roasted chicken) is excellent. The Lomo Saltado (beef and onion saute) is outstanding. The cerviche is among the very, very best in the entire Bay Area. Piedmont Avenue is filled with lots of good restaurants. This is an excellent restaurant and a delightful experience. Enjoy!< /Text>

They checked temperatures, ensured social distancing and I observed them sanitizing shared spaces. The prices were great. My pedicure was perfect. Tiffany did my pedicure. She was awesome! I loved that the owner greeted all of the customers/regulars by their first name.< /text>< Pictures>

I always get what I need when I come here. They're friendly and sweet. The place is clean and well kept. I've been coming here for years for both nails and lashes! Cameron is amazing and frank, I like it when my beauty person has an opinion, it makes me confident that I'm not being sold but actually valued.</Text>

I’ve been getting my nails done here about once a month for about 3 years (pre-pandemic), and their Mountain View location before that, but I prefer the Sunnyvale location overall. Billy and all of his staff are very professional and friendly, and the atmosphere is always polite and relaxing. The equipment is always clean and the techs are friendly and really listen to you when you ask for things to be done a certain way. I have only had good experiences at this salon and I can’t think of a single time that I’ve been dissatisfied or felt uncomfortable. I highly recommend OMG Nails< /text>

<Text>After trying many other nail salons in the area, OMG is my favorite. I was going to the Mountain View location but when they opened this salon in Sunnyvale I started coming here instead as it is much closer to where I live. I'm very happy with the quality of work.

Now, since covid, I've only been back very recently and I was happy with the precautions they've taken to protect customers. Plexi glass is up at the manicure stations and hanging at the massage chairs to separate the customers from the technicians. I was the only customer when they opened on a Sunday morning and the three employees I saw were wearing masks the whole time, even when they were just chatting with each other. I will definitely be back!</Text><userid>105928707619386769367</userid>< pics>

Consumer BEWARE!  OMG does not hold to their word, and will not go above and beyond for their customers.  Don’t get me wrong, the technicians are fabulous, the owner does not care what the clients want, tell you they will do a service for an additional charge, then go back on their word and say they won’t do it.  I have never been treated so poorly as a customer until now. Shame shame.</Review>

The people here are super friendly and genuinely try to help you when  you come in on a busy day or want something special with your pedicure. The pedis are pretty good, and I like the decor and atmosphere. As always, the massage chairs are a plus!</Review>

<review>1st time in my life I got a pedicure.  Basically,  i'm lazy when it comes to cutting my toenails.
It's a very nice clean place, the people are nice also. I would definitely recommend if i knew more guys that get pedicures.<//review>< pictures>

I really liked this place the first two times but today was not as great with quality of services. I think you have to find the good technicians and today I didn’t request anyone specific so that’s what I get. Uneven filing of nails and I had to ask the person doing my pedicure to do specific things which should be normal for a decent pedicure. My gel manicure is not evenly painted all around the nails and not smooth. :( Soooo- read the reviews and go to specific people otherwise you’re taking a chance on the outcome of your services.< /review>

< Review>
We had a wonderful experience!  We were a party of 7 for manicures and/or pedicures. We wanted to all get our nails done at the same time and they easily accommodated us. The staff let us bring in champagne and was super friendly and efficient.  My sister who got the manicure ruined 2 nails while we were still in the store and they didn't even blink and eye to fix them. We all had beautiful looking toenails or nails and were all very happy!< /Review>

I love this place, and its sister salon in Mountain View. The husband and wife owners take a lot of pride in what they do and they've been in the salon working and managing things every single time I've been here. The salon is very clean, every person that's done my nails did an excellent job, and what I appreciate MOST is the sense you get of the nail techs' professionalism and the fact that they are not being exploited. That alone is worth my absolute loyalty to this salon. I only get my nails done here, and I've recommended it to and brought in a bunch of my friends! Keep up the good work, OMG!</Text>

<review>We made an appointment the day before for 1:00 pm for two manicures and pedicures.  They only had 3 manicurists on staff when we arrived.  We were told it was going to be only a few minutes which ended up being 30 minutes.  While we were waiting they made little attempt to acknowledge we were there.  When we left they were still at least 15 more minutes from being able to start with us..  A 45 minutes wait is ridiculous for an appointment<//review>< Pics>

They are a wonderful and hardworking salon. They are very friendly, kind, and caring to their customers. I got full set acrilics woth gel for $40 and was worth every penny. She didnt slack off at all and made sure everything was perfect. Definatly go here and get you nails done! Also they did this past 7 which is their closing time because I didn't know. They stayed till 8:30 to do my nails. Best nail salon ever.<//Review>

Had a manicure/pedicure. My manicure was bad, it was the first time I left a nail salon unhappy with the job done. I even had to redo my nails 2 days later (it was close to closing and no one else was available to fix my manicure). My pedicure was done by another lady and she did a good job.< /text>

Clean salon, friendly staff, usually available for appointments even on short notice, tons of colors to choose from, and they do a great job! They're also a salon that provides SNS (acrylic powder dip) as an alternative to gel.< /review>

Spent almost 100$ for a FILL and pedicure. Was upset that the person doing my nails kept getting up I was here for 2 1/2 hours on mother’s day and it WAS NOT BUSY so super surprised by that.<//Text>

de Young Cafè in the Golden Gate Park was one of the stops of our city bus tour. It's a nice enough place, nothing spectacular. We paid $20 for a pre-packaged turkey sandwich, which I shared with my husband and a cup of orange juice. Very overpriced. You'd be better off eating from one of several food trucks across the street.< /review>

Nice cafe with a view, indoor and outdoor door seating, plenty of wait staff and free refill for tea! Good range of salads, sandwiches, hour and cold drinks. And if you want just a hard boiled egg, you can find it here too. Sure the prices are steep here, but which museum with captive audience don't do that? So if you want to economise, being a packed lunch to have on the beautiful lawns and seats then come in here for refillable teas.<//text>

<text>Attentive staff gets you though the line quickly so don't be discouraged by the long lines.  There is outdoor seating in the sculpture patio or you can dine inside too.  When there is a busy show at the Museum, they set up extra tents during inclement weather to provide extra seating.  The seasonal menu changes regularly, and they offer quick grab and go foods in their refrigerator case. Good for kids and grandparents alike!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>This place should have 5 stars all the way. Good food, very pleasant staff, fantastic atmosphere, what else can you want. I think a lot of folks think that leaving 3 stars is a good review... no its not! If you leave 3 stars it means there is something wrong with the place. (sorry for the rant)</text>< Pics>

<text>For one of the only places to offer food in the immediate area, it's pretty good. Selection of food will satisfy most, seating is plentiful and even faintly picturesque if you opt for a window or outdoor spot. Due to the monopoly of eateries in the park, it's naturally overpriced for what you get- which is likely my only gripe for this place.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

First a warning to visitors who don’t know the de Young Cafe system: in addition to their pricey menu you will be charged a surcharge which is a percentage to pay for their health insurance. Foreign visitors of course will also be surprised by the additional sales tax. I asked the cashier girl why the tax was so high and she still would not disclose the health insurance surcharge until I read my receipt - not very professional. It felt like she had intentions to deceive the customer.
In terms of their food: it is just so so. I had a pre-made turkey sandwich. The french bread they used was tough at the least. Instead of lettuce they used shredded cabbage. I suppose it prevents the sandwich from getting soggy. I didn’t have the chance to try anything else because they were getting ready to close.
Service was average. Most workers were not that into the job.< /review>

A decent selection of food, although I could always use more vegetarian options, and a very nice spot to eat. Can be a bit on the pricey side, but if you're not wanting to pack a lunch, it's a decent option while you're visiting the museum. Eating in the outside area is quite lovely.< /Text>

My Take: museum food that is actually pretty damn good | Went For: Sunday & holiday lunch | The Vibe: families welcome, day-drinking encouraged, desserts galore and art sculpture as a back drop | Special Dish: Duck Sausage over Pasta or daily soups | Avoid Their: Tuna Salad on old and nasty rye bread | Price Point: most well-sized dishes are under $15.00 | The Service: stellar all the way around | Reservations: n/a | FYI, FRIENDS: skip the inside seating, and soak up some arts and sun on their patio -- Eat up, Kimmie</review>

Fantastic cafe in the midst of a museum. They always fresh ingredients for their dishes (the ones pre-made in the plastic containers are not as good, so select from the freshly made menu).

I have had their soup of the day - always amazing. the flatbread is excellent.

If it's not too cold, definitely sit outside in the sculpture garden - love the space!</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Beautiful outdoor space to eat fine cuisine in the middle of Golden Gate Park.

Impeccable service, large area protected from the rain thanks to the beautiful Swiss architecture of the De Young museum.

Fresh seafood. Among the best shrimp I have eaten. Good little starter of prochuto, asparagus, cheese served as a small refined pizza. A little disappointed by the macaroons.

Excellent views, beautiful sunshine, a great way to start our week in San Francisco.

(Original)
Bel espace extérieur pour manger de la fine cuisine en plein milieu du Golden Gate Park.

Service impeccable, grande zone protégé de la pluie grâce à la belle architecture Suisse du musée De Young.

Fruit de mer frais. Parmi les meilleures crevettes que j'ai mangé. Bonne petite entrée de prochuto, asperges, fromage servi comme un petite pizza raffiné. Un peu déçu par les macarons.

Excellente vue, magnifique soleil, une belle façon de débuter notre semaine à San Francisco.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

As Willits tourists, we visited the bookstore after finding it on the list of the "Top 10 Things To Do In Willits." It's raining, and now my whole family is now curled up with a good book. The owners were welcoming. The store had something in every category. The prices were reasonable, and the clearance section was extremely affordable. If we lived here, we'd visit frequently!</text>

Great book shop! Much larger inside than it looks from the outside. Huge selection of books and little novelties. Staff was very friendly. Only comment I have is that the prices aren't the best considering most of the books are well worn, but certainly a great place to shop.</Review>

Their shop is a bibliophile's paradise, shelves upon shelves of books both new and previously loved, along with board games, strings for your guitar, and some of the most excellent socks and t-shirts my humor has ever found. If you find yourself in Mendocino County, head up to Willits spend some time perusing their shelves, step around the corner for a sandwich at the Loose Caboose, and take some time to explore a wonderful slice of Nor-Cal serenity.< /Text>< pics>

One of my favorite stops on the way to and from the Bay Area. Ignore the Willits bypass, head through town and check out these books. The store's about twice as big as you think it is and they also sell some great literary t-shirts. Really nice folks.<//review>

<Review>I Love the Book Juggler!! Chris and Greta, and their Terrier Zeus, are wonderful beings who run their business like a fine-tuned guitar❣️❣️❣️You will not only find used AND new books, but also sheet music, instruments, instrument accessories, cassette tapes, board games, greeting cards, bookish-themed T-shirts/zipper bags/baby onsies/socks/et cetera, post cards, movies, bookmarks, book darts, playing cards, graphic novels, calendars, free gift-wrapping, book-exchange for points, records, very old books (my favorite), and much more!!  If they don’t have they’ll order it for you and it will come fast❣️❣️</Review>< pics>

Yuge collection of books, good prices, no one chasing you trying to "help" while you browse. Can't ask for more than that in a used bookstore. Highly recommend a visit if you're on your way through town.</Text>

I love my hometown bookstore, Book Juggler!  I can count on Greta and Chris to always have a friendly smile, great customer service, and help finding the books I need both for personal use and my business.  The store is chock full of treasures to be discovered!< /Review>

<text>This is one of the best used & new independent book stores on the Hwy 101 corridor.  It's located in the town of Willits.  The staff is helpful and always friendly.  The store has a huge selection, mostly used books plus some very interesting cd's and dvd's, at great prices.  If you're a book lover like I am, you will really enjoy shopping here.</text>< gmap_id>

I've been coming here since I was a kid whenever I visited my relatives in town. It remains my Platonic ideal of a used bookstore. One of my favorite places - I always find lots of stuff for great prices.</text>

<text>Ahhhhhh, I love this place. 😀

Words. Words. Words. Visions. Dreams. New worlds of challenging and exciting explorations.

If you want to explore some magic in amazing Northern California - The Magic starts here, right in little old Willits. Small town, big heart and endless magic when you remember to slow down and embrace being in a slow moving, blessed miracle community. The future!

The Book Juggler is like stepping into a powerful magical realm of universal imaginations - where we mere humans think we are wisely choosing books, but the books have chosen us. 📚 Like a wand choosing a Wizard.

This has only happened one other time in my life in a four hundred year old bookstore in Norway, where the books found me. Now in your enchanted distribution hall of dreams it happens again. Thank you.

Northern California is soooooo fortunate to have a powerful magical portal to explore the true joyful spirit of reading and remember the truth of words that create our imaginations of the future.

I am so grateful that my wise elders were present enough to drag me constantly into all places that honored books. So I too, would always continue my love affair with those that so generously and painstakingly pressed their thoughts onto paper for all of us to share in their quest for a truly more magical and better world for all of us.

The Book Juggler, where books choose you.

The 📚Renaissance begins, again! ❤️<//text>< Time>

<Text>I had to wait a minute or two for the employee to come out from the back. I went to purchase an egg sandwich. I asked if I could get pastrami on the sandwhich and she said no you cannot do that on the breakfast sandwich. I was willing to pay more, but she did not even give me the option. I went with steak and took it to-go. She seemed in a hurry and not very friendly. When I went to eat my sandwich the egg was still cold.<//Text>< userid>

< Review>
Please don't go here unless you are okay with getting sick. Half the time I get sick and my son had his first sandwich here and got extremely sick. He's still suffering from it. All he ate from his sandwich was the veggies with vinagrette. I think its the cucumbers because I usually get sick from those too here. The food isnt fresh its usually soggy or hard and they are not consistent with amounts of anything so you will get a wonky tiny sandwich. They're also very unhappy here and will give attitude. They use to be better...< /Review>

The staff is nice but sometimes a little rude when they get very busy and it is a small Subway restaurant but make sure you don't sit in the far back table by the restroom during 12 p.m. because you have a lot of people's bodies near you because of the long wait.</Review>

<text>I’m only giving 4 stars due to my limited experience with the place. As context, I only go to Livonia as it’s the only place close to where I live that still sells the one frozen food my very finicky son will eat. I discovered it on Instacart and was pleasantly surprised by the place. Livonia is neat, orderly, and the staff pretty helpful. They carry some interesting items that you wouldn’t necessarily find at a typical grocery store but also all your standard needs. At a time when it’s easiest for all of us to shop the big box stores it’s nice to know there are some small indie stores that are doing it well.<//text>< pics>

This is a wonderful kosher market. Although it is small, it has a large assortment of almost everything you might need, beautifully displayed. The personnel are extremely helpful and friendly. The precautions taken in light of Covid are commendable.< /Text>

Best customer service - especially for being a large chain supermarket. Everyone who works here is super nice and helpful. Also there are always lots of discounts on things I actually buy regularly, which is great. Lines can get ridiculously long at certain times of the day. Seems like early evening is their rush hour. Try to go in the morning if you can.<//Text>

<Review>Not huge yet one of the nicest kosher/Israeli/Jewish /mideastern markets around Los Angeles, great central location, private parking on the back and the nicest staff that you will come across while grocery shopping.try this place you will not be disappointed!
They have kosher meats, chicken and cold cuts, breads and fresh produce and lots of imported items from around the world.</Review></record>

Not to much variety, is good if you need to get something in a hurry. But there are many other options with more variety and almost same price. Hard place to park, but they offer valet parking to compensate<//review>

<review>Nice small local kosher market.  Good selection, especially since their recent expansion into the corner storefront, nearly doubling their size, which also nearly doubled their parking spaces, a big challenge for most Pico-Robertson storefronts.  On Sundays they have freshly grilled meat.< /review><rate>4</rate>< user_id>

I shop here at least once a week!!! You can't beat there deals. You HAVE to be smart though some things you can definitely get less expensive else where. If you are a bargain shopper or a coupon queen you know what I'm talking about!< /text>

<text>I needed someone to fix my grandson’s hair after Nanny tried to cut it at home! And they were open and ready for business with new curtains separating clients and a cleaning protocol following each client. There are many stylists available and although it was a full house today, we only waited five minutes for his haircut. Very professional and his haircut is one of the best ever! Thank you!</text></record>

Ever since moving into town, this is my barbershop.  No need to look anywhere else!  A friendly, professional crew, a clean shop, and even movies played on the big screen to enjoy while there.  This is indeed “the best little barbershop”!</Text>

<Text>Great place, but one major flaw. They do not take electronic pay options (e.g., Venvo. Square). They only have a credit card machine which has a fee. I haven't carried cash in a few years.</Text><pics>None</pics>< rating>

<text>Julian did exactly the hair cut I wanted. All I asked for was a trim, but to do with what he saw best. He did the best haircut in 20 years. I will be back.<//text>< pics>

<review>Took my almost three year old for his first haircut. Since his hair is full of curls, I wasn't sure what style to go with. They had toys that every little boy would love. We let him play a bit and then he picked the PT Cruiser as his sit down and be still toy. I told the barber that I had no idea how I wanted his hair and I would let him just do his thing. We ended up with a slight mop top to feature his curls, which are not so defined now but still there. I'm glad I trusted him. We love his cut. We'll miss that head full of perfect curly q's, but the hair is out of his eyes and that was the main goal. The barber was super patient and kind. He just gets toddlers. He was awesome. We have our official barber that our son will grow up with and we can't be happier. They even gave him a certificate and saved some of those curls for us.<//review>< Pics>

Very friendly environment. I was referred to Jessica by a friend when I was looking for a new barber, I'm so glad for the referral because Jessica did an amazing job with my haircut. Price is decent compared to my last barber.</Text>

<response>None<//response><Text>Old fashioned barber shop, this really is the 'best little barber shop' in Redlands. I get my hair cut here on a semi relative basis. From the looks, they take turns with who comes in, the next barber available, and I've gotten a trim from 4 of the what looks like 6 barbers and have never been dissatisfied. They also have old Western movies playing too, which is usually entertaining at the least. Great job guys, I appreciate your service.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>We've been here many times, and the haircuts are always fabulous.  What is better, my sons LOVE going here because they have an assortment of toys in the waiting area (though the wait is never very long).  They do an amazing job cutting my husband's hair (a retired marine, who is very particular about his haircut) and my boys (who wiggle constantly).  Such a gem of a barbershop!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The cut was fast, and they trimmed my beard as part of the cut, but they didn't cut my hair the way I wanted in. In fact, they actually acted like I should never want my hair to look that way.< /text>

My first time there today(8_22_14). Jessica did my cut. I havent had such a great cut in a long time, been going to the Supercuts and family cut chains for forever. Nice friendly and courteous staff. And you get to watch TV!!! Want to say I will definitely be back. Glad I discovered this little place!</Review>

< Review>
Window says "fades". I specifically asked all the barbers, "can you do an underfade? Are you familiar with what I'm talking about?" I was promptly advised that not only were they familiar, they do them all the time. What i received was the sides of my head shaved bald, with a small patch left at the top where my hair was longer. I was reluctant to evem go to this barbershop, but when i was reassured so adamantly, I took a chance. Biggest mistake Ive ever made. If old man trims and cuts are what u seek, maybe this is your place. But being lied to is why there rating is so low.</Review>

<text>Always accessible and well lit, making entering my storage unit feel safe and secure. The staff is always willing to offer support and is friendly at all times. Great storage facility, clean, secure, easy to access. Sam and Kristine were very helpful when I moved in...they made a stressful moving time very painless.

Just finished renting a unit with them. Arian was very helpful and informative. Nice that they offer insurance and the unit was cleaned before arrival. No after hours so don't have to worry too much about people living in their units which I've seen at other places.</Review>

<Review>1$ first month is normal.
They are the cheapest in the area.
Thier staff is actually probably the best in the area (local Extra Space rejected returns of bran new unused equivalent)
Access hours: 6am - 9pm through gate.
Rates were increased $5 after moving in. Insurance is high, get AAA instead (a few dollars a month) cancel later if you like. Locks are expensive (get your own of 50% or less at HD across the street)< /Review>< rating>

Kristine and Arian and their crew are absolutely AMAZING! They take time out to care for your needs in storage. Their prices are reasonable. I would recomend this company to anyone. The location is safe and I am worry free 7 days a week!<//Review>

<review>So far I've only taken one (heavy) car load of stuff but other than having to find my new unit (the numbering is a little surprising at first) and realizing I parked about as far from it as possible. My mistake, their were plenty of trolleys right by the elevator that is closest to my 3d floor space so great. Its December now but after trucking a load of speakers, small appliances, and some other random things that would fit in my car downstairs from my apartment I absolutely appreciated the A/C . The only thing I would want  the buildings labeled better because I didn't see any on the exterior. I also apparently tried tried the wrong entry gate at first. These are tiny things that would only happen the first time.  My unit is a 5 x 10 and I am regretting not getting a 10 x 10 a little but I had too much stuff so a purge is not unwelcome, and that is on me anyway. Hindsight and all and I have never used a storage unit before. In my case its *maybe* a mile from home so that makes it convenient for me.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80e940b32426dd4d:0x14da2fb57c8b670f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Amara, the manager, was helpful and efficient in renting to storage units to us.  She got us two first-month discounts, which helped a lot with the expense of renting.  I also like the security that requires a unique code for each rented unit both to enter the facility and to leave.<//Text>

Public Storage in Goleta, was a great place to store my possessions! The storage unit was clean. I felt like my stuff was safe.:) The  customer service was excellent! Kristine and Arian helped me out, and were very understanding and friendly! I have rented a storage unit at this location twice. I recommend storing your belongings at Public Storage in Goleta!< /Review>

<review>Love this storage unit. Tiffany was awesome and so helpful with our quick checkin. It is clean and very secure. Never had any problems with renting here. Great price for a 10x10. Thanks for keeping short term storage reasonable.<//review>< pictures>

I had been looking for a storage facility for my car since April 2019. In SB they are far and few between. Kristine, the property manager, told me that they had the facilities I was looking for but that there was a waiting list. She said that she would call if something opened up. I was pleasantly surprised when Kristine called me yesterday with the good news that something had opened up. I immediately went over to sign up and secure the unit. Originally, she had showed me an exterior parking space, but as we talked she also mentioned the availability of a enclosed "garage type" unit. I took a look at that unit and took it on the spot!  Kristine was very informative and answered all of my questions. She knew everything. I know from searching from Lompoc to Oxnard that those units are RARE! And to make it even better PS is currently running their Labor Day Special - Half Off selected units. So if you are searching, check them out FIRST!
Thank You Kristine!< /Review>

Terrible service. I was very upset with everything because they charge extra for stuff that you need. They wouldn’t let me use my own lock. I only need it for a month and I had to buy a $20.00 lock. Not cool. After this I won’t ever go back. Kristine wasn’t helpful one bit. She also told me that rent will increase as well if I stayed. Reasons why I’m only there for a month. I tried calling corporate and no one answered. Not a great business.</Review>

Came in here 5 minutes before closing as a walk-in with a friend, and Sam and Amara helped us get the right unit and set it up within less than 15 minutes! A great experience and half off our first month!! Couldn’t be happier with our service today :)</Text>

I received a follow up phone call from Sam after booking on the internet. Sam made check in, viewing the unit and finalizing the rental super easy. He was knowledgeable and patient about all required details. Best experience I've had lately. Plus I received an awesome first month price due to internet reservation.< /Text>

Public Storage is very well managed. Employees are curteous and helpful if needed.

Less expensive than other storage facilities in the Santa Barbara area.

Clean and well maintained.< /text>

Check how water will flow in a rain.  Is there light/electricity you may need a flashlight. Insurance is required, can add to your home/renters insurance. Filling out forms a lot like buying/selling real estate!< /Text>< pictures>

I am currently stuck inside the facility as the gate attempted to open and fell off the track. After numerous phone calls without a response I went to go speak with the on-site manager only to find out that none of the members of the family living at the facility are the manager and all have no affiliation with public storage. I was told the manager lives on site, but clearly that was a lie. Ease of mind is not a priority here. I will be switching units ASAP—that is if I can even leave this place.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< review>
This is regarding the Goleta, California Public Storage site, location #75078.

My experience, from start to finish, was five-star!

The customer service gentleman, who answered my first call to inquire about renting a storage unit, was super patient with all of my questions. He was knowledgeable about every aspect of renting the unit.

Kristina, the manager of the site, was very thorough explaining the process of renting the unit, accessing the unit, and the future process to exit (close out) the unit.  Kristina escorted me to my storage unit, showed me how to use the lock I purchased, and was super patient as I practiced using the circular lock, with which I was unfamiliar.   I felt confident that my beginnings would be safe there.

Kristine, the assistant at the site, was friendly, spoke clearly, and confidently guided me when I called on the phone.

Thank you staff!

I highly recommend storing your belongings here.<//review>

Got a unit today and had a great experience with Henry. Even though the unit I got is up in the 3rd floor, really hot, and I HAVE to get insurance for it (which I know I will NEVER use) , for the price and location I suppose I don't really mind it. Thanks Henry for showing me all my options, and resources like the flatbed available to me. I do wanna say I had trouble signing in online but Henry gave me the customer service number and had no wait time so it wasn't a big deal. Thanks!< /Text>

<text>I am a disabled veteran and nobody offered to help. Staff stayed late to accommodate me. No garbage containers offered at this facility. Bring your own packing supplies and lock. Everything's expensive. Did not list me as a veteran cuz I'm not active duty.. did not have any carts available to transport belongings. Just at the main facility.

<Text>This location is fantastic because the location is maintained and regularly cleaned. Inside the gates the roads are spotless and the units do look new. If you move, confirm payment, or price it is then sent and delivered to your e-mail or home mailbox.

I would not recommend renting a storage unit from public storage. The employees at this location are hit and miss, some of them were helpful others did as little as possible. Beware that company policy is that they will keep the entire last months rent no matter when you move out! I moved out 2 days into the month and they refused to prorate the rent despite turning around and renting the unit to someone else. This means they are collecting rent twice for the same unit! Seems fraudulent to me.</review>

I rented a 10x10 unit and was helped by Anthony. He was very professional and helpful. He was able to show me the unit and get the all paperwork done very quickly. The experience overall was very pleasant and I highly recommend it if you need to store anything.</review>

I got a drive up unit for the convenience and was happy with the facility. The staff was nice and tried selling me packing supplies which I declined. The website and its features, like online bill pay, make the experience easier than I had with a different local storage site which is a huge plus.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>This location is fantastic because the location is maintained and regularly cleaned. Inside the gates the roads are spotless and the units do look new. If you move, confirm payment, or price it is then sent and delivered to your e-mail or home mailbox.

They have ZERO customer service skills here! We had some water damage in our home & were in need of a storage unit for some of our belongings while the repairs are going on. When I walked in there were 2 employees at the desk. Both submerged in their cell phones. I stood there for a minute & finally the female employee acknowledged me. I had questions about sizes & prices and it was obvious she wanted to be any place but there as her attitude made it very clear that I was a "bother". She had a jacket on so I didn't see a badge but I think she said her name was Melissa or Monie? Something like that. I ended up leaving and going to another facility. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who doesn't know exactly what you want as they are not friendly if you have questions!< /Text>

Henry did a great job of showing the property and guiding me through the process of reserving a storage unit. He was friendly and courteous and made renting very easy.</text>

< Review>
I was looking for a storage space on a short notice and nothing was available or was on the second floor. Was I lucky to check this Goleta storage location!! I stopped by and got the most amazing service!! Not only the agent Sherri was the absolute best, but I ended up renting. Completely different and better unit than i originally thought, but it was on the first floor and perfect location.  ABSOLUTELY BEST personnel  AND SERVICE. HIGHKY RECOMMEND.</Review>

<Response>None<//Response><text>Worst storage space ever...the employees are rude.  The manager is a first class ass. Worst experience ever..i would not recommend this place at all..dont be a victim. Dont fall for their gimmicks..false advertising. Its not a dollar like they say. Too many hidden fees. Read the fine print people. If you must pay for storage there are much better places you can go. If its up 2 me..1 star is generous..in my book. This place is a big fat zero.< /text>< UserId.>

Don't rent here!  Save yourself the hassle. Employees are rude & if you have an issue they do NOTHING about it. I've complained several times about people loitering by my unit & nothing was ever done. Now I show up to my unit & find the lock has been tampered with so I went in to notify the office & the staff acted like it was no big deal. Said they'd leave a message for the manager but I haven't heard from anyone.< /review>

Switch and bait tactics between national website and facility in Goleta. Deal made on their website counts as nothing when you get to facility. Signed up for one unit online but was told it was unavailable when I got to facility. Prices at facility higher than shown on web—switch and bait tactics at it's worst—and employees seem very aware of it. The fault though is not with employees but with company—very, very bad business practices they are undoubtably aware of ....<//review>

< Review>
I reserved a storage unit and was quoted a $68 unit on the 3rd. They failed to give me a cancellation call, which is the policy at Public Storage. One of the managers informed me that they did call, a day after they had already canceled my reservation. The most alarming part is that the same unit shot up over 25% to $97 only TWO days later... The corporate office played hardball telling me I should have read through the "fine print", and this is month to month anyway- and that unit prices can go up even after someone moves in...  Horrible experience!!</Review>

<review>Always been a a fun place to go for all ages, nice clean bathrooms, pool table, arcades for the kids, full bar for the adults, amazing restaurant to get your snacks or meals, lanes are well maintained, tons of balls, you can visually see them disinfect the shoes... nothing but good things to say.</review>< Pictures>

<review>The music was good, but the machines and service sucked. During our game, the lane kept adding pins that weren't knocked down to player's scores. We played it out because we were only there to have fun, but I noticed the same error on other lanes as well. As I paid, I informed the person behind the counter, Frank, of the situation and told him that I probably wouldn't be back because of the apparent lack of interest in maintenance. He responded, "Good! We don't need you here. You can drive out of town and pay $15 bucks if you want to bowl." He continued to yell at me as I walked away.

I will not be back. Despite being the only bowling lane in town, the lack of functional machinery and rude service was definitely unacceptable.<//review>< pics>

I’m an Airbnb host and was duped by people claiming to be a small group. They absolutely destroyed my carpets and Travertine. I had more guests coming and had to get someone out fast.

During the pandemic it was a challenge to say the least. Valley Carpet was recommended by my neighbor. I called and within an hour Mike came out (with mask) for what I thought was an estimate but he was able to start right away.

He was extremely knowledgeable and experienced and never tried to up sell me but was honest and did an amazing job in 100 degree weather. He was here most of the day and he was definitely a blessing to me. I highly recommend this company and their best employee Mike.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We have used Valley Carpet Care in the past and when it came time to do our carpets again we could not remember the company name (stupid us). We ended up going with a diff. company and it was not the same level of service and quality that we recieved with Valley. We ended up searching old invoices and finding Valley Carpet Care again. Mike came out and was super efficient with the whole process. He explained all the steps, tools and products that would be used. There was a lot of wear and tear but our carpets look awesome. We definitely will only be using Mike and the Valley Carpet Care team from now on.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Thomas is our usual tech. I use them regularly and have for about a year now. Their pricing is competitive but affordable and they can almost always get us in right away. They're able to get pesky pet odors out of the carpet and stains are no match for the chemicals they use. Always friendly, always on time. There is a reason they're highly rated!</text>< Time>

Mike gave me a pre-service phone call with his estimated time of arrival and was right on time. He was very polite, professional and answered all my questions respectfully. This is the fourth time I’ve had Mike out and he never disappoints me. Valley Carpet is a great value and excellent service. I highly recommend Valley Carpet cleaning services!  My carpets look and smell fantastic.</Text>

Big Mistake on my part ... I wanted to try to save a little so I went with someone else for carpet cleaning!    Valley Carpet Care is outstanding --- I've used them twice and was very happy and astounded at the quality of cleaning.   My Carpets looked like new.   No visible stains.    The "Someone Else" ... carpet was clean in one area.   The other two rooms had streaks, and the stains I wanted cleaned was still there.    You Want QUALITY work ... Go with Valley Carpet Care< /Text>

Excellent work Valley Carpet Care! My carpets were a mess and now they look brand new. Couldn’t be happier. Plus I live upstairs in an apartment and they were able to accommodate what others I called were able to. Will be using again thanks again!< /text>

<Text>A couple of days ago I hit the Google to find a local carpet cleaning company. I made contact on Wednesday and today I have had an amazing technician in my home literally scrubbing my carpet and tile floors for the last 6+ hours. 🤩 I am ecstatic with the work that is being done. He is not even finished as I write this review. Thank you so very much. My floors are beautiful. Our technician is Mike.</Text>< Pictures>

Thomas did our berber carpet and 40 year old tile entry.  Just an awesome job on both.  The family room was especially  in need of cleaning and now the carpet looks like new.  I will definitely use Valley Carpet Care again and will hopefully, be able to have Thomas come out.  He's very personable and you can see he takes pride in his work. Great job!</text>

Forrest with Valley Carpet Care was both cordial and professional when entering the house and taking care of my carpet he did an excellent job the carpet looks brand new and he was timely on his appointment he confirmed and was right on the money he gave me a 20 minute window and he arrived 20 minutes to the hour. So I would highly recommend Valley Care Care.</review>

Valley Carpet, Inc.,  is a five star plus company. From the first phone call to the completion of the job was one of the most professional companies Ive dealt with.  Our carpet technician, Forrest, went the extra mile and did it with a smile on his face.  Their pricing was better than most.  If you can, ask for Forrest when you need to have your carpet cleaned. From now on I willl only use this company.<//review>

I recently purchased a home and before I moved in I wanted the carpets to be professionally cleaned.  The carpets throughout had deep dirt wear patterns.  I called Valley Carpet Care for a quote after reading reviews on Google and Yelp. Mike Kelly came out and explained the how dirt, wear, and stains can affect not only carpet but the padding below as well. He went to work on that carpet and it came out looking, and smelling, absolutely wonderful. He also cleaned two cloth recliner chairs and did a smashing job on those as well. I will definitely be a return customer with Valley Carpet Care.< /Text>

Punctual. Respectful. Thorough. Josh did an AMAZING job on BOTH my mother's AND my grandmother's houses. It was pure luck of life that he was the one who came out and took care of their carpets but I'm SO happy he did. Dude did an awesome job in their homes.!! They're still talking about his work...a week later!< /Review>

Just bought a very old house and the carpet was really in need of some TLC. Mike & Jared did a fantastic job of getting rid of all the stains & bringing it back to life! I can't say how much I appreciated their thoroughness to detail! They were on time, careful with my freshly painted walls & I completely recommend them! Great job!< /text>

Valley does the best job cleaning my carpet, better than any company I have ever used.  They have cleaned my carpet twice, and I will always call them when I need carpet care. I have pets and stairs so my carpet gets pretty dirty and they make it look like new again (its 10 years old)! Their customer service is great. I got an appointment for the next day and Asher and another technician,were professional, friendly, and explained the pricing and my options completely. They arrived when they said they would and did an amazing job. Best carpet cleaners ever!!< /review>

< Review>
My wife and I needed carpets cleaned in our rental home.  We looked at reviews and found Valley Carpet Care. Bryce came to the home and was very friendly and  knowledgeable. He explained the cleaning process and did an excellent job on the  tough stains. The older carpet looks great! If you want professional service, I highly recommend Valley Carpet.<//Review>

I called on Friday and they worked me in for an appointment for the next morning.  Bryce arrived promptly with a cheerful, customer-oriented attitude.   He went right to work, was diligent in attending to the concerns I shared, and was careful around glass top dining table and piano. The carpets look and smell fresh and clean again!  I will request him for the next round of cleaning and recommend him to anyone wanting a thorough cleaning!< /text>

Today Mike and Aaron came to clean our carpets using the 5bedrooms and a hallway coupon. They were friendly, professional, and efficient. They let us know which tools would work best to remove certain stains and protect the carpet but didn’t pressure us into anything. It was a great experience! The carpet looks good as new. Always happy when we use Valley Carpet Care!<//text>

Mike and Matt did a great job cleaning our carpets and our tile! They were prompt (same day appointment) and professional. Our grout was almost black in our kitchen and I couldn't believe the difference when they finished! I would highly recommend them!<//Review>

High quality work and customer service. Both times we used this company, Bryce was our service advisor. Extremely personable, flexible and genuine. The nicest most respectful attitude towards noisy families like ours. We have small children and he works around the chaos with a graceful understanding. We really appreciate that. Thank you for being the best in town. Service is everything, and we love this company because that’s what they pride their company on!<//text>

<Review>Used Valley Care Carpet Care last year. Good service so we had them out again today. Mike was our technician; very courteous, friendly and prompt. Called ahead of time with an ETA which I appreciated. Carpets are very clean and fresh (we have a Labrador dog so we need the extra deodorizing). Mike also cleaned our oversized chair and couch; both which are old, but look as good as new now! Thanks for the great work and we will be using your services again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Valley Carpet Care came highly recommended from a friend.  When I called to make an appointment they were able to come out the next day.    My appointment was scheduled for 9 am and they were at my door...on the Dot!   I was  extremely impressed because they showed up with not one van...but TWO.  Mike and Thomas did an amazing job on my carpets. They brought them back to life.  I will be recommending them to everyone I know.  Valley Carpet Care has a new customer for life!< /Text>

Ramy and Jacob were on time, courteous and professional. We had some questions about products we used  to address pet urine and they were knowledgeable about why our black-light show "hot-spots" after we treated the carpet. Turns out, although our product got the urine out, there is a permanent stain that will show only under black-light from the "dying process," that occurs with urine. That made us feel better.

This was the second time we used their services, and we'll probably be calling them again next year. We invested nice coin into our very plush and white carpet, so we look for the best and that they are.<//review>

<Review>Valley  carpet care did a great job. Mike actually came early which was great and was prompt courtesy and professional. Definitely recommend and will use on my move out.

My only problem was I used a $225 coupon add when booking and that included a sofa loveseat which I didn't even have, but then charged $300. No real justification just I needed a deal clean?That's a big jump on a budget.</Review><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Bryce came to clean my carpets today. What an amazing job he did. Very thorough and very personable. I feel like I always get a great deal from Valley Carpet Care relative to the amount of work they get done. They also do tile cleaning as well. I had no idea until today and will certainly use them in the future for that service. Can't say enough good things about Valley Carpet Care.</text>

<review>Best service ever!!! I rarely take the time out to post a review but WOW I’m too pleased and my expectations were absolutely met! I called Valley Carpet Care on Saturday morning and made an appointment for the following Monday morning. My carpets were done quick and efficient; I had plenty of time to get the rest of my errands done... I came home to a house that smelt so fresh and clean no nasty water residue smell, or soppy wet areas left behind! Bryce and Mat are professional and highly resourceful when it comes to the tricks and tips to long care carpet preservation; I will definitely be contacting Valley Carpet Care again and will continue to do so here on out! Thanks Bryce and Mat y’all are amazing ⭐️🌟⭐️🌟⭐️🌟5 stars plus more<//review>< pics>

<Review>I could not be happier! This has literally been one of the best experiences in customer service I have ever had. Bryce really went above and beyond taking the time to explain to me the exact process. I felt comfortable having my carpets cleaned knowing that there would not be any harsh chemicals or residues left in my carpet. I have two dogs a cat and a small child and Bryce was able to make my carpets look like new. I will definitely be using Valley carpet care for any and all of my carpet needs and would highly recommend them to everyone. He was fast efficient and on time very personable and friendly. And I am beyond happy with the results. Thank you so much for doing such an amazing job. Fast, professional and a great value. Valley carpet care really can't be beat.<//Review>< user_name>

Look no further - this is a carpet cleaning company you can trust!   I’m a repeat customer and am impressed with every interaction I’ve had with Valley Carpet Care.  I’ve mainly used them in my rental properties in the past.  Today, I want to give a special shout out to the technician that came to my personal home  - Dave did a superb job!!!!  I’m house sitting a dog and needed some special sanitation and deodorization treatment.  My carpet has never looked or smelled better!!!  Dave was extremely knowledgeable, detailed, and pleasant to work with.</review>

<Text>As a consumer, you expect a company to have great customer service,  high standards, to deliver on their promises, and to stand by their product; and Valley Carpet Care delivered big time!  Bryce,  cleaned my carpet and he is an awesome technician. He came ready to work-full of energy! He was personable and took the time to explain the best plan of action for my carpet cleaning needs.  But more than that, he listened to my frustrations as I have a small dog who likes to mark the corners. Although, I  had been vigilant about cleaning up behind my dog -the smell of the cleaner and the urine was killing me. Bryce, treated the carpet with magical enzymes, used a heavy duty machine to clean the carpet, and took his time to ensure that he focused on the areas that I pointed out to him. It's been three weeks since my carpet was cleaned, and the urine smell has not returned, the carpet dried in a timely manner, and there was no soapy residue left behind. Sorry,  I did not include pictures because my carpet did not have any deep stain issues. I wish Google had smell-o-vision because you would truly understand how well this company cleans carpets. As a pet owner and renter, I was terribly afraid that I would need to replace the carpet in my apartment. However, Bryce saved the day! This guy knows carpets and he enjoys helping customers solve their carpet care needs. I will definitely recommend Valley Carpet Care to my friends and family.  Thank you for being such an awesome company-keep up the good work!< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
I have been using Valley Carpet Care for a couple of  years.  Even though I was not very happy the last time a tech came out I must say that this company has great customer service.  The owner called me directly and offered to do what ever was necessary to make me happy.  I understand that sometimes things do not always go they way we would like them and I must say I was very impressed with the owner.  Just to be acknowledged regarding this issue was a huge deal for me as you do not get that from most companies out there these days.  Valley Carpet Care is a company with integrity and truly has an honest  desire to make their customers happy.<//review>

Our dog had a poo accident on our area rug. The rug was only about a week old and my wife was worried it couldn't be saved.

I called Valley Carpet Care at 11:08 am. Jacob and Ramy rolled up to my house at 12:30 pm in a clearly marked professional van. They wore clean presentable company polo shirts and were friendly, respectful, and efficient.

Jacob and Ramy knocked out the job in about 20 minutes and were packed up and gone by 1 pm. They even left some enzyme spray with me for free, in case something like this happens again! The cost was very reasonable compared to the other estimates I received.

I highly recommend this company and will use them again, if need be. Thanks guys, you're awesome!< /Review>

Mike and Christian did an awesome job! The combo of the rain and having to have my standard poodles in the house, they pee everywhere and we have kids here, they sanitized and made it safe again, that’s priceless but they start at $100 for almost the whole house!</text>

I have had this company clean my carpets since they were installed 9 years ago. Ever service call is a pleasure. It is a family owned business that takes care in hiring well trained, effective technicians. The result is always up to my high standards. Their pricing is also very reasonable. I highly recommend them. All technicians are great and Mike who came today was no exception. Very pleasant and comfortable to have in my home.  Something I don't always find with service people.<//review>

Another fantastic job and great experience with Valley Carpet Care!!  I was able to get a same day appointment and Ramy came out and did and outstanding job.  He was very professional and explained costs and process very thorough. I had some pretty tough stains on the carpet but Ramy did and amazing job and I couldn’t be happier.  I will definitely use them again in the future!!</Review>

I have used Valley Carpet Care for eight years and they have never let me down!  Twice in the last 10 years I tried another company.... once because a neighbor recommended (and the company spent more time trying to 'upsell' me than clean my carpet), and once because I got sucked into the ads about 'rezidue' being left on the carpet. (The result was fine but not as good as VCC, and much  more expensive.   This year Forrest was my technician and he was wonderful!  As with all the VCC techs, he was prompt, professional and dedicated to dealing with all my carpet's weird issues.  He was also super friendly and really did a great job.  Definitely a Valley Carpet Care client for life : )< /Text>

Brent is the man! He said he couldn't promise he would make the carpets look brand new, but they do! And they were so bad, I was about to just get new carpet. Now the carpet is the cleanest looking surface in the house.< /Review>

< Review>
I would highly recommend Valley Carpet Care.  I called close to the holidays and they were able to put me right on the schedule.  We were impressed with Bryce who did the cleaning.  He called in advance and was informative and efficient.  He spent extra time on the dusty areas and the carpet look great. The price was good too. Next time I need my carpets cleaned, I'm calling them.<//Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<review>Originally planned on having them clean just my upstairs carpet and stairs.  They were having a 50% off sale on tile cleaning so I had them do my downstairs tile as well.  The carpets came out great and I paid the extra $30 for them to use the big machine which pulled a bad stain out.  Price for carpet was great, $155 + $30 for big machine to do the entire upstairs, 3 bedrooms, halls, stairs, and closets.  Tile cleaning is pricey, $1 per sq ft without sale, $0.50 with sale.  I also had them clean one cushion on my light colored couch because one of our cats got sick on it and even though we cleaned it up, still had a faint spot.  $25 to clean the cushion and it looks like brand new again.  The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the tile was still dirty in the corners so I had to do some touch up work myself.  The machine they use is round so it doesn't get the corners well.  Also, I had to touch up some places on the tile where it looked like there was solution dried and several foot prints in the solution.  Basically when the light hits it you could see spots.  I just had to touch it up with a wet rag, but for $240 tile price ($450 total job) I felt like I shouldn't have to do any touch up work.  These are of course things you don't notice until later when you think it should be dry but the spots don't go away.  Overall I'm happy with my much cleaner home and would call them again in the future if I wasn't planning to replace my carpet with wood flooring.< /review>< Rating>

<text>My husband and I were very impressed with the service from Valley Carpet Care. We suddenly found ourselves in a situation where a bunch of family were coming over for Super Bowl and we needed to clean our house desperately. We called Valley Carpet Care and were able to get a service appointment for the same day! All we were asked to do was vacuum our carpet and pick up nick-nacks.

When Chris P. arrived to our house he did a thorough inspection of our home. Reviewed any high traffic areas and noticeable stains. Even though we have two cats and two dogs he did not try to oversell the cleaning process with additional upgrades. Our pets are well trained and have only had a couple accidents which we pointed out to him. He thought these areas were small and did not need additional treatments. We also had one area with a chemical stain and he was honest and said this was likely going to bleach out when he cleaned it. We were fine with that and were glad that he was honest with expectations.

All in all we were very happy with the service from Valley Carpet Care. My husband and I joked that we are now real adults because we have had our carpet serviced. Since we were new to the process Chris P. was very helpful in explaining the process and setting realistic expectations.

Thank you!!</text>< Date>

<text>Shorter version: I got the 2 rooms and hallway deal for about $68 dollars. I payed an additional 30 dollars for deeper cleaning in one room. Bryce, who came to clean my bedroom, family room, and hallway is super nice and professional. He answered all my questions, reassured me, and worked to get the spots and dirty patches in my bedroom and family room. The hallway was pretty clean since we usually have a rug down. The family room we'd given up on because we have two toddlers running around. It looks so great now. I am really impressed! And my room! Wow!! If you're debating on whether to hire this company, look no further. Call now! :) I'll definitely use them again in future.

Slightly longer version:
I tried to clean my carpet myself 2 days ago. My Aunt has a portable carpet cleaning machine that she uses so I thought I'd give it a go. Today she looked at the carpet and wasn't at all happy with the spots and patches or dirt? left in my room. It was pretty horrible. Even though it was much cleaner, I couldn't figure out why the middle of the room was so soiled. Turns out it was sesame seed oil soaked through my towels that I use for massage. I've lived here almost 2 years! 2 years worth of oil I use every day.
I called Valley Carpet Care and they quoted me a price and said they'd be here tomorrow. I asked if there was anyway they could come sooner. Today's my birthday and I wanted to start my New Year off with a clean room. Lucky for me, that's exactly what happened. They were able to send Bryce out the same day to help me out. He's professional, thorough, funny, friendly, and just all around a good guy.  Grateful to hm and Valley Carpet Care for the excellent work!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Brent is the man! He said he couldn't promise he would make the carpets look brand new, but they do! And they were so bad, I was about to just get new carpet. Now the carpet is the cleanest looking surface in the house.</Review>

I called Valley Carpet asking for a carpet cleaning  but I needed it ASAP .  They were more than helpful in making that happen in fact they were able to come the next day.
Mike the service tech showed up on time and did the walk through telling me everything he was going to do explaining all costs associated to them.

I have a brand new baby ( my granddaughter) at the house all the time and I wanted it sanitized above and beyond a typical cleaning. By the time mike finished not only did he do exactly what I asked and what he said he would do, the carpet throughout the house looks brand new AND the house smells amazing!!
Awesome customer service from the office to the field and an amazing job done by Mike.
I’ll definitely be calling them back for all my carpet cleaning.
Thank you VCC and Mike for a great job!!!</text>

Bryce did a great job with our carpets. We had two rooms completed and even though there were a few areas of heavy wear on our carpet he paid close attention and everything looks great. He listened closely to directions we are pleased with the experience</Review>

Josh was terrific. Management here wouldn't allow access to the outside water spiket but that didn't deter Josh. He just filled the buckets over and over again until the job was done. He is getting a big tip from me. Valley Carpet is great, prompted and accommodating.< /Review>

Mike has done an amazing job on our carpets.  Our dog ran into a skunk and then got into our home.  We did everything we could on our own to get the smell out.  Mike was able to get the odor out of our carpets and the carpet looks amazing.  I have been a Coit customer for years.  I will never go back to them.  This is the third time I have used Valley Carpet Care and each time I have been above completely satisfied. I am a customer for life.   Mike has been very professional and is an expert at his job.  I will be requesting him in the future.  Thanks Mike for a great job!

We've been happily using their service for almost a decade now. We have always been provided beautiful, shining clean carpets, along with phenomenal customer care! Bryce always goes the extra mile, does a fantastic job, all with a smile on his face. We couldn't imagine using a different company, and we highly recommend them to all!</Text>

I called at 12:00pm on a Monday to get my couch cleaned and they had someone here by 2:30pm.  Pretty impressive.

My friend's dog peed on my couch.  We cleaned it the best we could with all the advice we found online, and it only made the stain worse.

Bryce was friendly, efficient and professional.

Their truck and equipment was high end.  I have had some carpet cleaners come in the past and it looked like they had built their machinery out of stuff from the scrap yard.

Definitely recommend this company and Bryce.  Will use them again.< /review>

Outstanding service.  I answered my door to a smiling technician (Bryce).  He was friendly and very knowledgeable about what needed to be done to get rid of the stains in my carpet.  My call to the service was only yesterday and they sent someone out the very next day.  Going to schedule the rest of the house but you  have to send Bryce.  Very satisfied customer.</text>

<Review>Bryce did a great job with our carpets. We had two rooms completed and even though there were a few areas of heavy wear on our carpet he paid close attention and everything looks great. He listened closely to directions we are pleased with the experience</Review><gmap_id>0x809ade5ace56dfb5:0xe6515437595974c5</gmap_id>< user_name>

Found these guys on yelp yesterday about 3pm and they just up today @8:45. Got to work right away and just finished making my couch look brand new. Mike and Christian were great. Can’t say enough about this company and their customer service!< /Review>

I’m very satisfied with Valley Carpet Care, my carpet looks spotless and smells very fresh. Christian was very professional and very nice. He was fast too! We sure will have more business in the future!

I used Mike at my house. He was so good and thorough, that two days later I reused him at my office. I highly recommend you ask for Mike. He has been the best that I have had with cleaning my carpets.< /text>

Mike has done an amazing job on our carpets.  Our dog ran into a skunk and then got into our home.  We did everything we could on our own to get the smell out.  Mike was able to get the odor out of our carpets and the carpet looks amazing.  I have been a Coit customer for years.  I will never go back to them.  This is the third time I have used Valley Carpet Care and each time I have been above completely satisfied. I am a customer for life.   Mike has been very professional and is an expert at his job.  I will be requesting him in the future.  Thanks Mike for a great job!

So my wife found them online. She first hired someone on fb and they did great. 2nd time she hired someone from fb and they did really awful. He had one of those machines you can buy on your own (didn’t look professional at all).
Well she was looking on fb again and was looking at people’s yelp and we decided to try a company since more reliable and less fear of loosing money. They came on Monday just as expected, and before they came they called (very professional). We got Forrest Brownell and let me just say he did an amazing job. The prices are same as what now individuals charge on fb but many don’t have a long experience or a proper training and your left with a carpet that dries up then shows all the stains again.
My carpet was already old, been living here already 6 years; plus a dog and a child. My wife came home and was shocked how clean it is. If your worried and unsure who to hire, go with this company. Professional and results.</review>

Mike and Dylan arrived at my home exactly when they said they would.  They were knowledgeable about their process and thoughtful and courteous in their interaction with me (and my dog).  I am fully satisfied -- and impressed with how effective their system is.  They were able to remove stains that I had determined were un-removable.  I also asked them if they were able to "scotch-guard" the cleaned carpets -- and they did so.  I will definitely use Valley Carpet Care again.  5 stars!!</Text>

Bryce just arrived at my home and he is totally awesome!  His customer services skills are outstanding.  In fact, I did not need to wait to write this review (my first time after years of carpet cleaning) because by simple observation I am certain that the carpets will be cleaned better than ever.  He introduced me to options that I have not heard about in the past.  Way to go Valley Carpet Care! I am proud to be a long-time customer.  Thank you Bryce.<//review>

Couple things I noticed about valley carpet care: 1. Someone answers the phone every time I call. This saved me time. 2. Cost effective pricing. 3. Timely service. They got me in next day! 4. My carpets are clean. Thanks Mike for a great job! He was courteous, professional, and very knowledgeable.
My carpets are clean!< /text>

<Review>We looked online and this company has great reviews, is A+ with the Better Business Bureau and had a good coupon rate and is family owned.  Nick came out, cleaned our carpets, was fantastic with our unending questions, gave us information and answers.  He is knowledgeable and made our 12.5 year old carpets look great and added lavender smell for us. On time, no point of service sales and easy!

<Review>I was so sick of looking at my 10 year old carpet that hadn’t been cleaned for a few years,  I wanted to rip it out and replace it immediately. When shopping for new carpet, I became overwhelmed with the choices. I decided to look into having the carpet cleaned to buy some time. So glad I did! Ken answered the phone and sent Nick over the same day. I’m still going to get new carpet, but at least it’s livable in the meantime. Great price and really fast. I’ll use them when I get new carpet too. Highly reccommend.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I waited until the last minute to call for carpet cleaning and they were able to accommodate my last minute request! The technician, Mike, was timely and did a great job on or carpets and tile. He was able to remove some pet stains and walkway wear patterns, leaving the house looking and smelling fresh!< /review>

Rob and Mat did a tremendous job cleaning our tiles on the main floor. Tiles were originally very dirty and once Rob and Mat steam cleaned the tiles, they looked brand new. I would highly recommend Valley Carpet Care to family and friends.</Review>

We had very unusual stains on one of our carpets which resulted in 3 additional visits from Ken and his staff in an effort to eliminate the stains. They were relentless and tried various solutions to the situation until the right combination was found. That carpet now looks better than it ever has! Valley Carpet Care is prompt, professional, very responsive, and cares about the customer. This is the only company I will use for carpet cleaning. They are the BEST!</text><userid>104072325658971465074< /userid>< Name>

<Review>Bryce from Valley Carpet Care showed up this morning to clean our carpets.  After our initial greeting Bryce asked me to to show him any trouble spots.  My traffic areas were a mess!   He explained what he'd be doing and got to work!    Once he was finished our carpets looked beautiful.   Bryce was professional, friendly and easy to talk with.   I would recommend Valley Carpet Care and ask for Bryce!</Review><gmap_id>0x809ade5ace56dfb5:0xe6515437595974c5< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>Mike & Bryce did a fantastic job on my carpets. I thought they were trashed and  beyond repair. Mike reassured me that his super scrubber would do the trick and it DID!! After the deorderizer and final brush my carpets look great. Very pleased and recommend to all my friends!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Very responsive on the phone, easy and prompt. Eric arrived 10 minutes early (called me to ask if it was OK), was very courteous and made suggestions for carpet cleaning and protection given the "accidents" of my Yorkie and Border Terrier. Did pre-treatment and sanitizing. Very thorough, great job and I am quite pleased. Carpet looks new again.  Since this is my first time using Valley Carpet Care,  I wasn't sure what to expect. But now I am going to use them exclusively.<//Review>< pictures>

Chris did an amazing job! Our carpets are 15 years old and in the last 2 years our pets have gone to town on staining them up. Even our own personal steam cleaner was barely making a difference. When he was done, I couldn't believe how clean they were. Chris was super cool & courteous and gave us tips on how to keep up on small spots in the future. He recommended that carpets get professionally done every 6 months to a year, so we definitely plan on calling back and having him come again. But for now we are two very satisfied customers, especially for the price! Thanks Chris!<//Review>

Very responsive on the phone, easy and prompt. Eric arrived 10 minutes early (called me to ask if it was OK), was very courteous and made suggestions for carpet cleaning and protection given the "accidents" of my Yorkie and Border Terrier. Did pre-treatment and sanitizing. Very thorough, great job and I am quite pleased. Carpet looks new again.  Since this is my first time using Valley Carpet Care,  I wasn't sure what to expect. But now I am going to use them exclusively.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Valley Carpet care is the best! I’m so pleased with the cleaning We are second guessing the plan to just clean the carpet for the holidays then come January put in laminate I even have the purgo purchased.  Dave knows his stuff! He found out what I wanted and you may say duah a clean carpet silly but it’s no so black and white. Like once the carpet is clean they have a special coating that helps keep it clean. And Brice worked so fast with a great eye to detail he’s polite professional and friendly not to mention  respectful of our home. The entire staff was a pleasure to do business with.  So not only would I recommend them to family and friends I’m trying to find my receipt for the flooring.< /review>< Pics>

The first time he was able to completely remove my three month old's explosive diaper accident and this time he completely removed my liquid foundation makeup stain! I won't bother trying to remove stains like these myself anymore since that just makes the area worse and spreads. I just call Valley Carpet Care and ask for Mike! And he was able to come out the same day! Thank you Mike!!< /Review>< Pics>

I don't normally post reviews for small companies, but this one deserves 6 Stars!!  The big company I called didn't have a appointment time available so I called Valley Carpet Care and they came right away.  Kyle did a excellent job and told me how to take better care of my carpet.  I'll be using them from now on.  Kyle was professional, nice, clean and carefull around my furniture. Thank You So Much!!<//text>

<Text>Chris did an amazing job! Our carpets are 15 years old and in the last 2 years our pets have gone to town on staining them up. Even our own personal steam cleaner was barely making a difference. When he was done, I couldn't believe how clean they were. Chris was super cool & courteous and gave us tips on how to keep up on small spots in the future. He recommended that carpets get professionally done every 6 months to a year, so we definitely plan on calling back and having him come again. But for now we are two very satisfied customers, especially for the price! Thanks Chris!< /Text><date>1455388445474< /date>< gmapID>

I was given an immediate appointment and Joseph called to let me know he was coming within the promised time frame.  He was knowledgable, friendly and efficient.  My carpets look and smell great! I will definitely use Joseph from Valley Carpet Care again.<//text>

<review>Mike with Valley Carpet care just finished cleaning my carpets.  I couldn't be happier.  He is such a hard worker and went the extra mile to make everything perfect.  I should have written a review a lot sooner as I have used Valley now for probably 10 years or longer.  There price is really fair. I have had others who charged a lot more and were not nearly as good.  A shout out of thanks to Mike and Valley Carpet Care!< /review>< Pictures>

<rate>5</rate><review>Valley Carpet Care is the best! They do great work at a great price. We have been using them for over a decade for our home and rental properties and never were disappointed. We even recently had to have a pontoon boat deep cleaned due to damage from the rain. It looked like a mess with carpets being drenched and mold on the seats. We thought this was not fixable, but Mike and Bryce were able to clean it all and made it look even better than before the damage occurred. Seems like there is nothing they cannot clean. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for carpets or even a boat cleaning.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809ade5ace56dfb5:0xe6515437595974c5< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hands down Valley Carpet Care is one of if not the best and most professional carpet cleaner in town.  They are always there and look to treat their clients the way they want to be treated.  It is truly a company that has deep values instilled in their entire team.<//review>

Mike did an excellent and very thorough job. He Worked very hard in getting rid of stubborn traffic stains as well pet stains and odors. My house looks, smells, and feels fresh and clean. Mike worked with me on troubleshooting the problem areas and my specific needs for overall clean carpets throughout the house. Very pleased with mike and Valley carpet care. This was my 3rd or 4th time using them and will continue and refer others.< /text>

We always used them before and they were great especially Thomas who was our guy but this time around they charge for every little thing and did not even use spray stuff for the spots like Thomas did before. Had another guy who was  more talk than action. Owner called my husband up and said about how they has to raise their prices..blah blah. Just not good customer service or work. Going to another company.  Don't use Valley.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>We had Mike come out and clean the tile floor of our Kitchen.  20 years of dirt and grime are gone. It is much much nicer!

We were also very happy that Mike was able to keep with the schefule they had promised.

We will definately use Valley again.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>This company is an absolute joke. If you plan on using their special for 2 room and a hallway for $57 with a $7 travel charge, they don't treat pet stains at all. They want to charge you with a $130 treatment extra to get it done. Beware from these guys. I could of done a better job with a steam cleaner.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I checked Groupon but could not find anyone to clean Condos. Low and behold while taking the garbage out I see a white van that just finished cleaning another unit. I asked if he had a card, Mike not only had a card but he told me he might be able to clean my unit immediately. He took my phone number down and told me he had to check with the main office. Within 15 minutes Mike called me back and told me he can clean my carpet today. In just one short hour he had my carpets looking brand-spanking-new. Mike provided exceptional customer service and quality work. I would recommend Valley Carpet Care to anyone seeking New like Carpets and the greater Sacramento area<//review>< Rate>

Just had Chris and Corey clean my carpet and my tile floors.  These gentlemen did an outstanding job!  My tiles look brand new, I'm glad I was able to do this service because I did think twice about it and almost backed out at the last minute, but looking at how clean my tiles got I am so glad I did it at the end.

Thanks for hooking it up guys :)< /Text>

MIKE TO THE RESCUE!!!
As new parents with expensive new carpet, when our daughter decided to paint the floor next to the changing table like Jackson Pollack, we feverishly tried to clean the carpet on our own. We made a dent, but in trying we noticed that a dot of blue sharpie under the carpet had seeped up and made  an even more noticeable stain amongst the others that didn't come out. When we purchased the carpet we were told that we couldn't use too high of suction (Dyson vacuum) because it would pull out fibers, so we were worried nothing could be done. Then we called Valley Carpet Care, we were assured that they had seen this carpet before and it wouldn't be a problem. Mike knocked on our door only hours later and went right to work. He did such a great job, and got out every stain... even the blue marker spot!!! We are so relieved and will definitely be calling to ask for Mike again next time our little human fountain decides to show off;)< /Text>

Mike came out to our new house in Rocklin and did a very awsome job. He called us to let us know he's on the way once he got here he went over everything with us. He did a very thorough job. I would really love to see service like this all the time. Thank you Mike.< /Review>

Thank  you Mike with VCC (hope you don't mind the abbreviation). this review is for 2/26/16, and also approx. a month ago. I've scheduled cleanings with Valley carpet care for many months (not an employee, friend or relative of any of them). I'm currently renting, and our carpet is white-ish, so I like to take care of it. Almost every time the folks from this company come to our house we're taken care of very well professionally. Pet stains, odors, etc don't seem to be a problem. I don't see any reason to change.<//text>
