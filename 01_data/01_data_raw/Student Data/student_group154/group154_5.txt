Dinner was great I over ate because it was so good garlic shrimp and chicken broccoli beef and sweet and sour pork. Chinese food really satisfies very friendly loyal courteous kind obedient cheerful thrifty brave clean and reverend.< /text>

If you expect reasonably priced and satisfying "American" Chinese food, this restaurant is your king of place.  Waters and waitresses are always nice!</Review>

The food is similar to Panda Express in price, but WAY better in quality! I've never gotten a meal I didn't like from Chef's Chinese.</Text>

Must be gold in it or something I’m good can some one tell me why it’s $17 dollars like what is in it<//Text>

Food is okay, fine or decent but took star off for unfriendly service (twice I've been & both times getting to go they weren't nice so don't expect good customer service). $8.50 for #2 or a two entree item combo which comes with rice or chow mein. Large noodle chow mein were over cooked & soggy though.<//Review>

I used to Always eat at Chef's, along with my client, Mrs. Alice 😊 I absolutely love the food here!! Very delicious!!!! They give you large portions..to where sometimes you just have to take some home with you, because you can't eat it all. I love the staff here...Carlos, Mia, Jessie...👍👍👍 I love it here, and plan on coming back soon!!! 😊< /text>

<text>Won't allow phone orders from the steam table only off the dine-in menu. Even during the pandemic. You have to physically show up and order from the steam table. If they are out of the item, you have to wait, sometimes up to 20 minutes for the kitchen to make it. I was told that if I insisted on a phone order of steam table items, they will charge the dine-in prices. I will be ordering from other Chinese restaurants.<//text><Name>RC InBayArea<//Name><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>2< /Rate><user_id>100491484773550626145< /user_id>< Time>

This became my favorite Chinese food restaurant so far. Very friendly staff, fresh food and great customer service. Great team at Chefs and makes you feel welcomed. They have option for a quick take out or a relaxing dine in. Both give generous portions!</text>

It's not that the quality of the food is poor (it's not), but that the taste is not the same. My favorite was the basil fish, but the last two times I had it, I was underwhelmed. The same for the fried rice. 😐</text>

Food was average. Had Mongolian Beef lunch. The soup was good and the rice was good. I would have preferred more spice in my Mongolian Beef. I'll be back. Next time I'll request it hotter. Service was better than average.<//Text>

Would give more stars but they are getting cheap with their food ordered kung pao chicken and the meat was cut so small I didn't get but a few pieces of chicken. Maybe they raised the rent so they have to cut expenses or they paying employees$15/hr< /Review>

If you are craving the Chinese-American comfort food you've been eating since you were a kid, the food here is solid, cheap, and the food moves so fast at this popular joint that the warming trays at the counter stay pretty fresh.<//review>< Pictures>

This is what Chinese food is meant to be. Delicious and not pricey. The environment is soft and family oriented. Looking for good Chinese food to dine in or to take on the fly I highly recommend Chefs in el cerrito.< /Text>

<Text>Just a great, well stocked store with knowledgeable staff. They have put me on a grip of fish with their suggestions. A must see. Live bait? If Reggie ain't got it, you can't get it.<//Text>< pictures>

They're nice people, they charge less than Romeo's for bait, however they don't carry my preferred blend of cigarettes that I smoke and they don't ever have birthday candles.  If that changes I'll give them another star.<//Review>

Told along with 6 others customers another 12-15 minutes. They are comping one person , disappointing another and just told me I guess our eta "wasn't right man"</Review>< pictures>

Customer service is amazing. We received a delivery which was missing some items but the staff worked diligently to correct the error. Unfortunately,  I had to call twice to straighten it out but the staff was professional, courteous, and helpful. I will, without a doubt, order from them again.<//review>

<Review>I come here pretty often for lunch, I call before hand to pick up they either put me on hold and leave me hanging for more than 5 mins or they forget and I get hung on. I've also called and they just hang up, pizza is hardly ever ready and I'll have to wait 20 mins for it. New record for today was 40 mins plus they forgot to give me my drink, never coming here again I gave it multiple chances.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Pizza is good, my wife likes it better than I; but both of us were very unhappy today.   My favorite part is their coke machine, only type of machine I get diet caffeine-free vanilla creme coke, or diet cherry or orange hi-c or minute maid.
Requested for them to refill the diet sweetener portion since all diet drinks were out.  Waited 25 minutes, asked again if they are going to refill coke machine, answer was "not sure."

Then to-go sausage/pepperoni for my son and his friends arrived.  This requested to be in a to-go box.   But was server as dine-in.  No box, and took almost 15 minutes for them to give me a box, every time I went to counter to request box, the cashier said she will bring one.   On the 3rd attempt, finally I received a box.

My wife is ok with meat toppings so she had one slice from the to-go pizza.

Our dine-in cheese pizza finally came out 40 minutes after we ordered, but in a to-go box???

My wife had already finished by this time.   So for me, water to drink after paying for a Coke, (Note, they offered a refund, but I refused hoping they would replace the diet sweetener in the machine), and our pizza finally came out after my wife was ready to leave.

Added after reading other reviews, our cashier was not rude at all, she was a little clueless and didn't listen well, but definitely was not rude.< /text>

The spicy honey they put on the pizza is a new fresh, and interesting idea that really works, and explodes in your mouth. Brilliant! Who knew? Well I do now, surprised and exstatic I found out how good it really is. Nice job guys!<//Text>

This place is complete TRASH!  Ordered food for my family of 6 on a Sunday night 2 hours goes by and no delivery at all. Now the business is closed and it’s passed 10pm on a Sunday night everything is now closed. Avoid this place at all costs these LOSERS have no business being in business. The reviews for this joke of a pizza place speak for themselves, hire better help!< /review>

<Review>Best gluten free pizza I have had so far, and I felt extra re assured that my pizza was actually handled as an allergy as it came in a box sealed with a sticker stating it was gluten free.  I am allergic to onions and garlic so I didn't have sauce on my pizza and it was still absolutely tasty!<//Review>< userid>

Have ordered lunches for our staff from Fresh Brothers about 5 times.  Staff is friendly, curbside service for pick up was great and staff loved their pizzas (choice is fantastic & individuals are generous)  However, twice I ordered a salad for myself.  First salad (BBQ Chicken) was wet and goopy; soggy wet lettuce was the issue.  Second time, trying again, we asked nicely if my salad (again BBQ Chicken) could be on DRY lettuce and explained the problem.  Just opened the salad.  So wet it is inedible, like soggy seaweed.  So.....pizzas are great.  Salad....thumbs down.  Sorry to say, cuz I love the Brothers.<//Review>

OMG I can't belive the bad review s I order from here all the time love this place. Always delivery they follow instructions well (my door bell doesn't work). Have to say garlic knots are the best so are the wings. They even have gluten free options. And to the people that got bad food why would you not call them right away to fix it.<//text>

I have ordered Pizza several times to-go but I have to say that I miss Z Pizza that used to be in that location.  Fresh Brothers is way over priced for what you get and the pizza is just average. Salads seem wilted and I would rather just grab something next door at Pick Up Stix if I'm in a rush.

Also another thing is that the delivery cars from Fresh Brothers are ALWAYS taking up the front row parking spots at Harbor View Center, which is a real turn off to customers.  I can't believe management allows that, much less the Irvine Company, who owns and manages the shopping center.<//text>

Finally a pizza with enough cheese! I recently had an issue with an order and they were so quick to apologize and correct the problem that they solidified a customer. Any time I want a quality pizza I will come here. Also, you must try the cauliflower crust!!!!!!!!!!<//text>

<text>Sorry guys, the pizza was just okay, no biggie. The store is nice, lottsa attentive, friendly order takers, at least 8-10 TV's adorn the walls….all of them!

We ordered the antipasto salad and a medium pizza w/extra cheese - 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 green pepper, thin crust.
The salad was very nice; the pizza was less than mediocre: extra cheese(paid for)not there; the green peppers were there, but one needed a microscope to find them. They were cut sooo thin that they were almost impossible to see or taste; the pepperoni was a total waste - no flavor at all, quite thin and over cooked.
Salad = 3.5 stars
Pizza = 2.3 stars…being generous

I might suggest for aficionados of really good, tasty, loaded pizza try Nick's on Harbor or even Pizza Hut compared to this poor example.</text><GmapID>0x80dce09226e401d5:0xb3c0e5c8d4b2c9d1<//GmapID>< userid>

I had a VERY positive experience at Hayashida - got what I hoped for and more. The physical therapy and exercises Christopher gave me are helping already. He was thorough, knowledgable, professional and very committed to helping me. Bravo!<//text>

<text>Very friendly staff from the front desk to the therapists.
The downtown facility is very clean and safe feeling with serious covid protocols being enforced. The open space of the studio is very comfortable.
Chris has been an amazing help in my rehab and very communicative.
I appreciate how he listens and adapts my treatment to my current condition rather than following some pre determined treatment.
I'm very impressed with everyones professionalism and highly recommend Hayashida & Associates< /text><UserId.>100516378593183453093</UserId.>< date>

<review>Previous experience with PT had been lukewarm. No noticeable help/changes.
To be fair, This could have been a lack of protocols given to the therapists, but the therapist I have been working with at Hyashida, post total shoulder replacement is a game changer. 2 stage goals; mobility then strengthening are well underway. With excellent results.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80e914e9d27bc011:0xdeb4fa0b0ce16f6e< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Hayashida is an exceptionally well organized PT center.  The staff roles from check-in to therapy to physician communication are seamless and show exceptional thought and planning.  I have never had to say anything twice.  How rare is that?  I had a difficult program (rotator cuff) and was completely perfectly and sympathetically supported by a fine therapist with specific and exacting goals.  And no marketing at all.  What a relief.  Finally.< /Text>< username>

<Review>Best PT experience I've had. Dr Fong is the bomb, zeros in on pain source and in my case it was alleviated in just a few sessions. Highly recommend the professionality of this therapy team, covid protocols and cleanliness of the facility. Also the video demos of the exercises prescribed was extremely helpful.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>THIS IS CURRENTLY MY SECOND EXPERIENCE WITH HAYASHIDA & ASSOCIATES IN 2 YEARS! IT IS THE BEST PHYSICAL REHAB EXPERIENCE ONE COULD HAVE. CARING DOCTORS, WHO ARE BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND PLAN EACH SESSION WITH WHERE A PATIENT IS IN HIS OR HER PHYSICAL HEALING. FRIENDLY DESK STAFF AS WELL. IT GIVES ONE CONFIDENCE THAT THE PAIN WILL BE HEALED IN THE BEST WAY. THE DOCTOR(DR. KIM IN THIS CASE) HONORS THE PATIENT'S PAINS DUE TO HIS OR HER BROKEN BONES AND IS ALWAYS ENCOURAGING.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Amazing and extremely knowledgeable personnel helping me through my tough times with this surgery I had! Wow! After my first session of physical therapy  I left with my arm out of the sling; feeling very comfortable and slightly moving it around with minimal pain.  I am able to notice the difference every single time After my therapy sessions. Always leaving with more knowledge on how to speed up my recovery And of course my movements extremely improving! I will own this knowledge for the rest of my life! I am Very happy to be a patient here. Thank you all for your help! Highly recommended by me!</review>

After a recent injury,  I was referred to a different PT facility,  well long story short that facility was not williling to accommodate the hours I was available.  Fast forward enter Hayashida & Associates.  The staff there is very welcoming, knowledgeable and friendly.  I have dealt with Dr Chris and I absolutely love him. He is funny, listens to what I am telling him and my pain level etc. Also have had a few interactions with Brandon and Daniel. The facility is clean and wide open. The ONLY downside is parking.</review>

I went in for lower back pain and have noticed a difference in my strength even in 8 sessions. Jason's great at answering questions and explaining how things work (and there's a lot of things to know when it comes to the body...), and sends me home with exercises and stretches to practice on my own. Very attentive staff, highly recommend.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Hayashida Physical Therapy is a well run practice that has realized outstanding results for me with multiple issues. My therapist Jason Hubbard is outstanding both in terms of skill and the ability to communicate what  needs to be done, by whom, and for what reasons.  I had been skeptical of the benefits of physical therapy prior, but I see its full value now.  The Hayshida office staff are great as well.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Name>

I had hip replacement surgery and have received outpatient physical therapy at Hayashida & Associates. My physical therapist, Annick Lamb, has been exceptional in giving me excercises that are healing and strengthening. I see the progress every session. Annick explains the specific area each excercise addresses and always checks with me regarding pain. All of the staff I have come in contact with are efficient and pleasant. The facility is neat and clean. I am very pleased with my experience here.< /Text>

<review>The therapists here are knowledgeable and personable. My PT, Jon, figured out what was causing chronic pain in my leg and numbness in my leg. Parking can be a little crazy during certain times of the year because they share their lot with a number of businesses but look for the three reserved spaces in front of the office before driving around. There is a reason everyone gets referred here.< /review><rating>5<//rating>< Name>

<text>I went to Hayashida for pain relief from a congenital disease in the neck.  My physical therapist Ted, is AMAZE BALLS. He is super professional and considerate. He knows exactly what he's doing and helped me  relieve my pain and strengthened my neck and shoulders. I really appreciated his kindness and patience (especially on my "I don't feel like doing this today" days) Over all, Ted and Hayashida are great and I recommend them to anyone who needs this kind of treatment.</text><Rating>5< /Rating><user>113992454336177469615<//user><Gmap_id>0x80e914e9d27bc011:0xdeb4fa0b0ce16f6e<//Gmap_id>< username>

I had a herniated disc that was causing pain the stiffness in my back. After consulting my neurologist he suggested Hayashida. It did help and gave me great exercises to do at home complete with a phone app to follow , awesome. Excellent therapists, attentive,  professional, on time, I would reccomend.  I did ultimately go for surgery because of the nature of my condition , I will return for further therapy after I heal. Thank you Annick.< /Text>

I have always found the practice to be accurate in diagnosis, successful in therapy and organized. I have the highest regard for all that they do.

I live in the Midwest and have been spending one month in Santa Barbara.  I have recently been diagnosed with an arthritic hip and did not want to delay physical therapy until I returned home in March.  Hayashida & Associates worked quickly and efficiently with my health care provider and with my health insurance company to arrange physical therapy in a timely manner.  I was very impressed with how they accommodated me as an out-of-town client.  My treatment by Jon Sakota was exceptional.  Complications arose immediately because of acute pain I was experiencing.  Jon listened carefully to my concerns and observed me carefully and saw that I needed to see a specialist before proceeding with therapy.  Jon referred me to a local orthopedist, who saw me the next day to address the issue of my pain.  I cannot say enough positive things about the help I received from Jon Sakota.  I was so fortunate to be able to work with him.  I highly recommend Jon as a skilled and empathetic physical therapist.<//Text>

I have endured five running injuries in recent years including knee, hamstring, and hip which I thought might end my 49 years of regular runs.  Each time I was treated by Hayashida therapists and could return to consistent running.  Hayashida prescribed exercises have prevented the same problem to recur.  I highly recommend Hayashida & Associates Physical Therapy for any sports injury.<//text>

I couldn't be more pleased with my experience at Hayashida PT, and with my "hero" there, Jason.  I was referred there through my doctor and insurance to treat intense tingling and some pain in my left arm.  About 10 years ago, before moving to Santa Barbara,  I experienced pain in my right shoulder and pectoral muscle,  which was ascribed [via MRI/X-ray examination] to cervical stenosis [i.e. deterioration of the spine at the neck].  While PT solved that immediate problem,  the doctor warned that the long term prognosis was for more serious problems.  So I was pessimistic that the tingling could be due to a pinched nerve at the neck and would require surgery,  something I dreaded,  given my understanding that surgery on the spine can go awry.  Jason reassured me that there was a good probability that stretching and loosening the neck joints [via his manipulation of the neck and assigned exercises] could solve the problem,  and it did!
Further,  the facility on Anacapa St. is pleasant,  quieter and more organized than  some other PT operations I've used over the years.</Review>

Esperanza and Miya are very kind and welcoming when you first enter the facility. Dr. Chapman is great! He goes over the details of what he will be doing and why. He’s very kind and more than willing to address any questions and concerns that you may have during your visit.<//review>

I was referred to this practice after a  recent car accident. I have been to a chiropractor before, but never has the experience even this positive. The office intake staff is wonderful, quick, and very friendly. The office is very clean with masks, sanitizer, thermometers, and spaced for distance.  Dr Sean takes the time to explain in a very understandable way what is truly involved with a soft tissue injury. He has a plan for the therapy it takes to allow your body to heal correctly, and most importantly in a pain free manner. I am very satisfied and glad they are taking me through this process.< /Text>

<review>Always friendly and professional. The chiropractor (John) is very friendly and knows his stuff. I have been going here for over a year and took a break. Started having spams and went back for treatment. Back started feeling better almost immediately. Haven't had a spasm since. Been 6 months and I go now just for maintenance.
I am also currently pregnant and he has a way of handling me carefully but also getting the job done as well. I will continue with these services for as long as he's there!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Staff were always helpful and friendly.
Face masks are required to enter and temps are taken as you check-in. There was also always at least one person sanitizing equipment between patients...well-organized to keep patient traffic flowing and feeling safe...< /Text>

<review>I was SO nervous to try a chiropractor but after seeing Dr. John for over a year now, I’m blown away by it! It’s been such a huge modality for pain management. I love how he explains why he’s doing something. And the office staff feels like family now. Highly recommend!< /review>< Rating>

This is a long overdue review! I love Sheridan Chiropractic Of Riverside the staff are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly! I am probably the worst person with punctuality and they always manage to accommodate my busy schedule. The office is extremely clean and well kept. The doctor is the most important part of this review....Dr. Chapman is great! He is great because he is gentle, efficient and friendly. I highly recommend Sheridan!< /text>

Well I must say my experience here has been nothing but a good one, the doctor's are friendly the front office staff is amazing and very personable.  They always greet you by your 1st name make you feel very comfortable being there. They are very informative and not pushy but do explain what it is that needs to be done to help you deal with your issue.< /review>

This place is amazing! I was in a car accident 2 and a half months ago and I've been going here 2-3 times a week since, as physical therapy, and it has completely changed me. The Doctors are very informative on the phases of healing and really just wanna see you get better. Dr Chapman is who I usually see and he's wonderful, always working with your and your bodies boundaries, and always checking to make sure that you're comfortable with the work done that day.

The service: My first alignment (my third appointment, because the first was in house x-rays and the second was setting a game plan to recovery) was by far the best sensation I have ever experienced, it was almost an emotional release, and it really felt like things were being put in place ✨ gently ✨. And every session since then has improved my results and my overall feeling of health.

The staff: Mia, Esperanza, Dr. Chapman and Dr. Sheridan are done of the most amazing human beings I have had the pleasure meeting. They are all so kind, so understanding, and so caring. They're always able to work with my schedule and always have valuable information to share.

The office: They are covid compliant! Everyone is screened for covid, and temperature checks are done everytime! All surfaces are sanitized between every client, had sanitizer is available too! It brings me a sense of comfort knowing they follow guidelines and care about the community to help stop the spread of COVID!

All in all, this is a great chirpratic office and I highly recommend going here.</text>

During this time of the pandemic, they’re keeping the offices and equipment constantly sanitized.

Customer service is 5 stars, because of the girls sweet demeanor, the quality of treatment 3 stars. Not that it wasn't good, but I've been to a few chiropractor the treatment is a little much better like 5 stars 5 stars. This place just ok, But that place burn down in canyon lake omg sooo good, I go in there feeling crooked and i come out straight lol but yeah so this is why we choosen this place because the other one building burn down.<//text>

<user>117880189093635542558< /user><review>I was referred to Sheridan Chiropractic by my daughter. I haven’t been to the chiropractor in years because mine retired and I was afraid to go just anywhere. She reassured me they were great and very clean (I’m a germaphobe). I was especially glad to hear that in the middle of quarantine.
I love that they take the time to explain what is about to be done, the causes of your pain and what to expect in the future.
I hurt my neck the other day. They took me in right away. I was feeling better right after the adjustment. I still have more to go but I’m confident Sheridan Chiropractic we’ll have me feeling brand new in no time.
The staff is amazing!!!  Dr. John, Mia and Riley are so welcoming and friendly. It makes you feel like you are coming to see old friends.
I definitely recommend Sheridan Chiropractic!!!</review>< Gmap_id>

<review>After one visit I was hopeful.  I had seen 2 other chiropractors in the last couple months with no relief of my issue.  I was becoming skeptical.  They are very thorough and conscientious about your issues.  Next day I actually felt better than I had for months.  Hopefully it will continue and get me back to normal quickly. Only issue was being a new patient and the extra long wait to be seen,  but it was worth it.</review>< pictures>

This is hands down by far the best chiropractor I have ever been to! The level of care is unbeatable. Not only is the staff friendly the Dr’s are also which is a rare thing now and days. The level of careful examination and adjustments made are unbelievable. I have notice a huge difference in only 2 visits.<//text>

< Review>
I've been going to to Dr. Sheridan for over 20yrs. On & off. They are great chiropractors & they know what they are doing. If you want to keep your body healthy & aligned these guys are the ones to go see.
Very friendly atmosphere.<//Review>

<Text>I enjoyed going to Dr. Sheridan, he was very easy and pleasant to talk to. When I left I felt better and he not only thanked me but took the time to walk me over to the Receptionist  to make another appointment.
I would highly recommend this Doctor to anyone.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dc9d933a32c887:0x8dce6f282cbb8e92< /gmap_id>< user_id>

I came in with some rib/back pain. I was diagnosed with a separated rib and was quickly taken care of. The doctor and staff did a great job of quickly addressing needs and even better they didn’t over prescribe more appointments than necessary. They are honest and helpful.</text>

They are very friendly and helpful, the Dr is very knowledgeable and takes the time to listen to the patient. He explained each procedure before he acted, and made sure I was comfortable before he continued. I was treated in a very timely manner but didn't feel rushed. I definitely recommend Sheridan chiropractic if you're looking for a good chiropractor I've been to both the Murrieta Sheridan chiropractic and the Riverside Sheridan chiropractic I like the Riverside much better.</text>

As a new patient of Sheridan, I have been very pleased with everything.  Dr. John, Riley and Mia are so welcoming and treat you like family.  During this time of covid, they are very clean and sanitary (as I would assume they always are).   Thanks for being great.< /review>

From the first day I arrived, I have received exceptional service. The staff listens and takes very good care of me. They always welcome you with a smile, and I leave feeling better after each visit. I am very satisfied with the Doctor's treatment plan. He is very attentive and answers all my questions. It was a blessing to have found them, when I needed them the most.<//Review>

<Review>Highly recommend Sheridan Chiropractic!
The moment I walk in the door, all the staff greet me by name (they do this with everyone). Checking in is always a breeze, the staff and doctors listen to all your concerns and questions and they genuinely care about their clients. Though I was released due to an acute issue, I will be returning for preventative care due to my Strenuous work/career. Can’t thank them enough for how amazing they are, even through This Covid-19 pandemic.</Review></record>

My experience at Sheridan chiropractic has been above my expectations. The staff is cordial, friendly, and has a remarkable memory in remembering names and what your needs are. They are professional, courteous, and I have gotten my questions and concerns answered and shown in terms I can understand. The VA had approved my visits here, and it has made a difference. I'm hoping the long term effects will continue to last longer and longer. Thank you to all the staff at Sheridan chiropractic. Sincerely, Gary Richards ☆☆☆☆☆< /Text>

I felt rushed to get in and get out. And the lack of bedside manor made me feel Agitated.The facility looks like the practice has been there since the 90’s and little has ever been done to update the tools of the trade or make rooms private. The lack of modern equipment makes me feel like the latest practices are not being used therefore my treatment is lacking. I also did not like the way the doctors spoke to the staff with micromanaging harsh verbiage that made me feel like I would not work there. So for more reasons than one I will not be returning.</review>

This place is top notch. I had been suffering from intense back pain for about 6 months, and had no health insurance. I had never been to a chiropractor before, and was really nervous to try it, but their initial adjustment was only 79 dollars, and that included x-rays of my spine! (which for having no insurance, is an insane deal, follow up visits are 40 and they work with you.) I felt instantly better after that first visit, and now after 3 visits (and some personal exercises and training at home) I have very little pain in my back, and my posture has improved tenfold. I feel like I can finally go back to doing the things I love. On top of actually knowing what their doing on the practice front, the service is fantastic too. They literally know everyone’s names (i’m not kidding), and clearly make an effort to make it a personal, easy experience for something that could otherwise be a little stressful for someone who’s never tried it before or has heard iffy things about chiropractors. Trust these dudes!</Review>

<Text>I worked for a Chiropractor,  M.D. and Orthopedic for 11 years.  When I moved to this area, friends referred me to Sheridan Chiropractic.  I am very glad they did.   They have helped me greatly.   As a busy fitness instructor,  there are many physical demands that can cause me discomfort and pain.   I am so appreciative for their care.  That are always kind,  I'm able to get in quickly for a routine adjustment and their staff is extremely courteous.   They are fantastic.<//Text>< pics>

I fell off a roof in April. My doctors couldn't help so I visited Sheridan Chiropractic. I have experience with chiropractic and know they can help. Dr. Sheridan is fantastic! His staff is friendly, professional and on top of things. Dr. is kind, professional and explains what is happening. I absolutely love this place. They are the only ones who helped me through the back issues after my fall.</Text>

<Text>Very professional staff, and both of the Sheridan brothers are excellent. I have been coming here for about 5-6 years every time my back starts to give me problems.  I highly recommend Sheridan Chiropractic to anyone that has issues with their back, knees, arms, hips.

Thanks

<text>I've been coming here for several weeks, 1 to 2 x per week, and I love it!  I start with a Lipo Laser Vevazz treatment, to rid me of fat cells and inches.  During the 20 minute process Mimi has me put on a headset with Light and Sound therapy which is very uplifting, and generally helps you to make better choices. After this, I step onto the whole body vibration machine for 10 minutes, which gives every muscle a workout akin to running.  After these treatments I feel so strong and energized and ready to be my best.  All of the people who work here are so cheerful and positive (especially Mimi), and that's exactly how I feel during and after every visit!  I highly recommend everyone give this place a whirl and see how it can help you be your better self!!</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

When you go through "adjustments" the experience can be overwhelming.  However the Sheridan Chiropractics experience was delightful and the staff is absolutely amazing and very friendly!

I highly recommend the Sheridan Chiropractics if you unfortunately are involved in an accident or for other medical related reasons.<//text>

<username>Nicole-Marie Menadue</username><Pics>None</Pics><Text>Highly recommended, couldn't meet a nicer staff! I was in a bad car accident and the first time driving after was to their office. I was having a panic attack upon arrival, so staff immediately sat next to me asked if I need water and wouldn't leave my side till I calmed down. The most thoughtful people ever! Every visit I'm greeted by staff on a first name basis, I wish I was good at names because they all deserve to have them listed here.❤  While learning the routines for exercises I forgot by the next appointment and the sweet girl who taught me to do them, dropped everything the second I asked if she could show me again. The Dr yet having several patients always takes time to greet me by name the second he walks in the building, before its my turn for adjustments. An amazing and thoughtful experience every visit. Highly, highly recommended!! Thank you to all the staff there, you really help people through a hard time!❤</Text>< resp>

Had a longtime chiropractor before sheridian, but suddenly ran into a hip problem that he was unable to fix for months so I tried 3 different chiropractors that were unable to improve my hip. I noticed the others chiropracters were not very thorough and just kind of did there routine thing no matter what the issue was. When i got to the sheridians, they fully assesed me with a thorough process of elimiantion and after 3 or 4 visits i was completely healed. I just wish i had known about them sooner then waiting 6 months with pain and seeing no results from other chirporactors. These guys are the best of the best. Thank you sheridians, because of you guys im able to run full speed again :)< /text>

I’ve been to a handful of Chiropractors in my life, so I didn’t need convincing of the benefits.  I found the physical therapy to be beneficial but the actual body work and “adjustments” lacking.<//Review>

<review>I have been coming in to Sheridan Chiropractic for two weeks now due to a lower back injury. I like that they answer my questions and use natural methods for obtaining health rather than covering symptoms. I have my peaks and valleys of recovery, but I am able to bend forward with minimal discomfort. I know I will get better. But like most things It will take time.

Sheridan Chiropractic also helped my husband 15 years ago with his work related back injury. He went from barely standing to full recovery. Since I have seen their work with my own eyes, I have great faith that they can help me as well. It is well worth the drive.< /review>< gmapID>

I was looking for a chiropractor close to my home. I went on google and the first chiropractor office I called was Sheridan Chiropractic. I was very impressed with Kelly just making my appointment over the telephone. Kelly was very professional, polite and heard my pain through the phone and scheduled me to come in the next day! Well, that was today, from the second I walked in, I was greeted by a very nice gentleman named Pedro. As my paperwork was getting gathered for me to fill out, I was informed about a free seminar on how to get rid of belly fat.  The free seminar is being held at the office on April 22nd at 6:45pm, I signed up right away!
I then took a seat and not more than just a few minutes, Tiffany came and sat down next to me and explained how to fill out my new patient paper work. After I was done, Tiffany broght me into a consultation room and asked me a series of questions regarding the reason for my visit. She then showed me a lighted map of the human body and explained to me what Subluxation is. Tiffany was very thorough. Tiffany then brought me to a different room and told me that Dr. Sean would be right with me...and he was! Dr. Sean took x-rays and also adjusted me. Dr. Sean is very patient and gentle. After her adjusted me, I then went to the front desk and made another appointment for this Friday. I highly recommend Sheridian Chiropratic!<//text>

(Translated by Google) In 2013 I had a car accident and
It looked very bad and thanks to Dr Sheridan
I was able to recover and from there I always recommend it because it is the best.
Thanks Dr Sheridan

< Review>
My husband's 85 Celica started acting up an hour after we started heading home in our vacation. Certified II Car Repair was able to not only get us in same day, but immediately. They were able to diagnose the suspected issue (blown alternator) and already had the part on the way before talking to us, to expedite the process. We were there and gone in roughly 2 hours. In our dealings, and the ones we overheard, they were fair, direct and courteous. And put up with a screaming bird. Based on this one interaction, I'd highly recommend them. As a female, I appreciated the feeling that they would have dealt with me straight.< /Review>

<Text>Be cautious with fees associated “challenging”check engine light diagnostics. They will continue to charge customer as more time is needed to diagnose. Components they suspected possible issues were not the issue at all. I felt this shop was incompetent and took vehicle to dealership to have it properly diagnosed with being charged one time fee and having results in one hour not 2 days with misdiagnosed results from this shop. Fees were still cheaper at the dealership than to continue paying fees at this shop.I feel partially scammed as I requested a refund which was denied. AI got nothing from this shop but wasted money and time. Will tell friends and family stay away from this place of business. 1 other thing to add is I had spoken to 2 different people there and they had totally conflicting information which made me believe this repair shop is that much more unprofessional and incompetent.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

I noticed they call a lot of their customers by their first names. It makes the Customer feel special.. Ask any question and they have the answer. It's a good shop. I have referred several people to them.</review>

I had to have my granddaughters transmission and Catalytic converter replaced and the team at  Certified Auto was absolutely great. Cody and Mike had compassion for the situation I was in at the time, and helped me out! Great team<//Text>

I took my car here for a noise coming from the engine compartment. It turned out to be worst case scenario. My engine was bad. They put a new engine in and updated me on the progress the whole way through. I had a motor mount bad and water pump as well and they installed new one's at no charge as they had the engine out, I just paid for parts. The quote was higher than most places I found, but you get what you pay for and I got some great work and it was well worth it.< /Review>

<Text>Didn't ask me what was wrong with my car. Didn't even let me explain the issue. Took it for a diagnosis which was supposed to be one hour but turned into 4.5 hours because they forgot. Said I needed a new transmission. Predatory and untrustworthy.< /Text></record>

Not reliable, incompetent mechanic...don't go to this shop,they just rip off your money..we send our car for repair - for engine lights on took them more than a month to fixed..And when we got our car - for Two days it went back again...We send it back again - they send there's another problem on the car. We pay for almost 1000 for repair, 90 days warranty is not part of it...</review>

< Review>
I checked out other auto repair shops before choosing Certified Auto ll. I thought Cody, whom I initially spoke with on the phone, to be pleasant. I told him that I may need the fuel pump replaced in my car but wasn't sure.
He gave me his thoughts on what might be wrong but I would have to come in for an inspection. He said that it might even be something as minor as a broken fuse under the dash that mimics a broken pump.( I don't want to mix words. I can't remember how he explained the two, but he did let me know that it could be either or). I appreciated that so I chose his shop.
After the inspection, we were told that it was the fuel pump. The next day he said that a few other things were found n my husband agreed to have them fixed.
When I went to pick up the car, I noticed the master window switch was lying on the floor. I told Tim, another employee, about it n said that someone in his shop had broken it. It WAS NOT broken prior. He said that he would have it fixed n to come back the next day.
I also felt that the car was running kind of rough, so I told them when I took it back the next day. The shop kept it until the next afternoon. I was told that three employees had driven the car n did not find it to run rough. The switch still had not been fixed.
I also saw the TV that is attached to the roof of the car was hanging, n later fell!
That TV was used VERY little. In fact, the original film on the screen was still on it!
I spoke to Cody about the TV n the master switch n told him that three windows would not roll up due to the switch n that someone had pulled the TV down n it also had fallen.
Cody informed me that I would need to speak to Tim about the switch n that his shop has been in business over thirty years n no one would break or mess with anything. He said they could replace the switch but it would cost ME $505.00!
Again I told him that his shop broke it but evidently he did not believe me.
California Sound, whom I bought the TV from, reattached the TV n let the windows up for me....for free!
Needless to say, I will not go back to Certified Auto ll, nor will I recommend it to anyone.
I am not prone to being dishonest n I always give compliments n good reviews to whoever deserves praise for their work. Where there is poor or dishonest service, people need to know.
This is/was my experience with Certified Auto ll n my review.</Review>

We have taken all of our cars to Certified for the past 15 years. The business is family owned and operated.  The folks at Certified are honest, friendly and really know foreign cars.  We recently moved out of the area and tried a new place.  The prices down here were double and triple what we were charged at Certified.  We are going to just make the long journey to the desert in the future because, honest, we don't trust anyone else with our cars.< /Text>

We have been taking our cars here for years.  Today we took our car because Auto Zone said there was something wrong with the alternator.  They checked it out, said nothing was wrong with it and there was no charge.  Great customer service!</Text>

They do what you ask, but they do not go above and beyond, and attempt to scare you to getting unnecessary things repaired.

My clutch went out on my 2001 Subaru Forester. I was referred to Certified II by a local new car dealer, so I figured they would be reputable for Subarus. I called them on a Friday morning to see if and when they can get it done. On the phone I was quoted $1100, and it could be done by the end of the next day if I brought it in by closing. $1100 is more than I had wanted to pay, but they were referred by the biggest dealer in the area, they must be the best, right?

I brought the car in by the end of the day.  In addition to replacing the clutch, they suggested I replace the rack and pinion (quoted $919), as well as the cylinder head gaskets (quoted $1500).  I knew ahead of time that the power steering was whining because of a leak, and of COURSE the head gaskets are leaking. ALL SUBARUS HAVE LEAKY HEAD GASKETS! I have no white or blue exhaust, and there are no indications that this is out of the Subaru-norm.

They tried to scare me into getting the other things taken care of. I declined both of these add-ons because, adding up all three quotes, it would cost me $3500 to repair my car!?  I can get another 2001 Forester for that amount!  Go ahead on the clutch.

They replaced it by TUESDAY, which is three days past the promised day of "NEXT DAY."  They gave me no excuse or apology for not getting it done by their projected date.  It was extremely inconvenient.

When I picked it up, the guy up front said, "what was your quoted price again?"  And I said, "$1100."  For funsies he went ahead and wrote up the bill reflecting that, instead of actually calculating.

He decided to throw in another $99. A sublet repair for resurfacing the flywheel for $80?  They don't need to sublet that,they can do it there OR, GET ME A NEW FLYWHEEL FOR $60! His numbers seemed arbitrary, like it was normal to add on something extra to see what he can get. I paid it. I don't want to replace the clutch myself, it would take me two weeks of trial and error.  I was happy to have a good, working, safe car for my 8 month old to ride in, even if I had to take out a small loan to get it done.

About 500 miles later, the clutch pedal starting sticking. It didn't happen all the time, but when it did stick, it prevented it from completely returning back to normal position, though was still 100% functional. Since I have no idea about clutches and clutch pedals, I called them and they said they'd take a look if I brought it in that day.

When I brought it in, the mechanic said there was a small leak near the clutch master cylinder that caused the pedal to stick.  He showed me the leak, which was TINY. And could have, should have easily been REPLACED WHEN THEY DID THE CLUTCH.  They went ahead and added some fluid to and sent me off with a quote for $158.  I decided to skip that repair.  Something seemed fishy.  I angrily drove home with still a sticking pedal....

At home I fiddled around with the pedal and watched the hose that "leaks." I couldn't find the leak. Instead I got under the dash to see if something was odd, and I noticed something really dumb. The clutch pedal was sticking to the floor mat.  Moved the floor mat, problem IMMEDIATELY FIXED.  Nice job, Certified II. Trying to find some reason for the sticking clutch, they just pointed at something that looked wrong and decided that was the reason.

My power steering kept whining more and more, and with the fluid indicator saying the reservoir was full, I decided to take it to a different mechanic to diagnose it.

Diagnosis?

Rack and pinion is FINE. This leak is smaller than a pin hole, in the power steering pressure line hose. The mechanic said to keep an eye on it, but to refill the fluid as necessary. The reservoir drinks the fluid as it's added, so it looks full even when not. The quote from that mechanic was $280 including labor.

Long story short: they will fix what you ask, but not go out of their way.  They price gouge.  They try to scare you into unnecessary repairs.</text>

I've been taking my Honda and Acura here for about 5 years. All my family uses them as well. They do great work at a fair price. Can't beat the oil change deal, they even wash your car. Friendly folks and highly recommended.<//Text>

DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE!!!!!
So this is the worst auto repair shop out here.  Not only did they have my vehicle all day to check it, but they gave misinformation after I had to call to see if they were done with it.  To make matter worse, when I went to pick up my vehicle, several wires under the vehicle had been disconnected and left to drag.  They told me they had nothing to do with it and as I started to leave they said to me "Good luck with it!" in a sinister manner.  I paid these guys $45 dollars to look at my car for them to tell me it was going to cost me $2000 to fix and it now runs worse than it did before I took it in.< /review>

I will be taking this business to court as they basically stole my car, no written agreement or documented exchange of money, and they lied about a verbal agreement when I went to go pick my car up.  The verbal agreement was predicated on repairing the car only if we could pay the $3000 in installments after returning my rental car.  It was put under a storage lien with no written notice that I was being charged for storage, the lien notice came in the mail a week late because they didn't send it to the right address so I couldn't oppose the illegal sale of my car.  When my boyfriend and I went in to have a discussion about working this out outside of court, the secretary started screaming at my boyfriend saying, "I have all the phone records, you're a liar!"  I calmly asked for a copy of the records and she went into the office and started talking on the phone.  Then my boyfriend and I were told the police will be called if we didn't leave immediately.  So, not the most friendly of people.

Also, I found out they have a car sales lot registered to the same address and there is a public record of Certified II Car Repair going to court in 2010.</text><rate>2</rate><UserId.>104597997017950144283</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

We had a great experience and found a wonderful recliner sectional at a super affordable price. The staff was very helpful and delivery was fast. We love our new sectional!</Text>

We have been looking for a sofa bed with a good guest bed and comfortable sofa for tv watching as well. Imagine my surprise to finger that Scandanavian Designs has several good choices. No sales pressure just good information And options.
Purchase was seamless as was the delivery.  The delivery guys were awesome. They went in through a window in our den when the doorway proved too narrow. Truly a no fuss experience.< /text>

<text>"I think the quality of the furniture for the price is good. I saw some solid wood furniture at another well known store that did not seem to be as solid but similar prices to the bedroom set I was bought. I also very much appreciated the service I got from Kevin. To me his main goal seemed to always be trying to key into WHAT I WANTED and he went way out of his way to help me get what I finally decided on.  I don't think I would have gotten it without his efforts!!!<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Looked at numerous stores for a couch and chair for a therapist’s office. Style, comfort and price cemented my decision to buy at Scandinavian Designs. The salesman was helpful and, as I prefer, low key. Delivery was very professional, they assembled the furniture and removed all packing materials. I consider myself a discerning shopper and have nothing but positive comments on my experience.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dbf8d6b5141caf:0x609e40a9c42ff5a5< /Gmap_id><text>I purchased a couple of these bar stools, waited a week to be delivered to the store / warehouse and I was told to call them and make sure those were at available and ready since their policy is to assembly those before the customer can pick up. One looks fine the second is wiggling so bad, unsafe to even seat. Very deceiving they can try to push a bar stool to a customer like this. Same day informed about the issue and requested a replacement of the broken one and was asked to wait another week for a new delivery. Received confirmation they have those in stock. The day that I was supposed to exchange the broken bar stool I received a phone call saying those were not available and was asked "if I could work and keep the broken bar stool, try to make it work". If you are looking for quality this is not the place to purchase.</text></record>

I live in Phoenix AZ & called the San Diego location too get info on having furniture shipped too Phoenix AZ. I have never purchased furniture without first viewing  the furniture in the showroom & I was very reluctant..I spoke too David Britton at this location..He was very helpful... I am aware this company will be opening locations in Arizona..The Phoenix Arizona location appeared to be 3 or 4 months out from opening..David followed up with me after my initial conversation with him too inform me that one of the AZ locations will have a soft opening this month..I just want to say the Customer Service I received from David was outstanding. I am calling from out of state & David treated me with utmost respect.  David Thanks for your time and help..<//text>

Recently purchase the Luke coffee and I am officially a fan of Scandinavian Designs. I had to use great self control not to purchase the perfect small dining table and chairs that I have been wanting for my new place. I only had money for the coffee table this trip but plan to visit soon for the table and chairs.</text>

I have not shopped in your store yet, however after watching the NBC local news tonight, I wanted to compliment you on the customer service you extended to a customer whose "leather" couch is peeling.

Great furniture, excellent service. I brought back an item and I was ready for a difficult time. But they replaced it with no hassle.<//review>

Art is absolutely AMAZING!!!  He helped me design my entire house by just looking at a few pictures of the space.  I was so fed up shopping and he came to the rescue to make it quick and easy.  My place looks so great now!!< /Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Their customer service is scummy and only care about you if you're a first-time buyer.

I bought the Tanaan Bed and 2 nightstands from Gary one week before their bedroom sale. Once the sale happened and I saw on their website policy they would match the lowest price, I went back to the store to get it price matched from Gary and he said he would do the price match and get the amount credited back to my credit card.

3 weeks later and two more trips of visiting Gary and he has still done nothing about it. I emailed corporate (funny they don't have the main office phone number on the website) only to get no reply but be thrown on the mailing list of their catalog two days after, which I did not ask for.

Today is the last day of their sale and it looks like they never had any intention of honoring their policy which states: "In the event that another local furniture, mattress or department store is offering a lower price on the same item, we will gladly match the price based on the manufacturer's specifications. Our pricing policy is good for 30 days from purchase date."

In this case, it's their own furniture that has a lower price and they won't even honor that.

Update: This issue was resolved.<//text>< user_id>

The portions here are great! I'd definitely recommend coming here. The food is always good, I like to ask for white chicken which costs a little extra but is worth it! This is my moms favorite chinese restaurant in town and its one of my favorites as well.<//text>

This is not the best Chinese place in town. I ordered shrimp and vegetables stir fry. I got soup. There was so much sauce! I told staff I was eating in house yet I still got my food in styrofoam container and plastic fork. The veggies and shrimp were good, after fishing them out of the sauce. I wouldn't say it tasted like Chinese stir fry, more like veggies and shrimp in a chicken broth sauce. I won't be back. Super disappointed because I've heard good things about the place< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>NEVER OPEN ON WEEKENDS!!!... Tried to call last Sunday (7-14-19) and no response. Tried to call in a order today (7-20-19) again no response. Took a trip to China Cafe and looked through the window. There was a guy in there, but the sign on the door said they were closed for the day. Standing outside the Cafe, I then placed another call to China Cafe and the phone just kept on ringing... What they had done was to pull the plug on the phone.
BAD BUSINESS!!! Will never consider China Cafe AGAIN!!!!!!!!!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Terrible! We ordered the family meal and everything was cold and stale. The food was soggy and tasted like it had freezer burn. We were upcharged for combination rice and received 3 shrimp in the whole container and a couple pieces of chicken. I literally could not finish my food and had to spit it out. Don’t waste your money here!<//review></record>

<review>Garbage. Over priced. They don't season their food. They charge extra for every little thing. Poor quality. Bad attitude. The only good thing is the portion sizes. Pot stickers were burned.< /review>< Pics>

Messed up on my order meat was all rubbery in the sweet and sour pork the fried rice look like it was drowned in soy sauce no flavor fried prawns were greasy.sweet and sour had no veggies. If I could I would give it a quarter star it would even make it to the half * I recommend nobody go there again.food tasted like it was microwaved</Text>

Didn't know if I should go in. I have been to too many shady ones. When I opened the the door, I saw 2 elder men waiting almost anxiously for me to come in. I also noticed a plaque on the wall from readers digest. Acknowledging the restaurant  in 2010. I ordered sweet n sour pork. Eating now. could have been a little sweeter but still yummy<//text>

My boyfriend & I came here for take-out. We wanted to try a new Chinese place & overall we weren't satisfied. The chow mein was tasteless, orange chicken mainly consisted of breading, & the sweet & sour contained rubbery parts in each & every piece. First & last time coming here.<//Review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>I don't know why the reviews for this restaurant are so high. I took a long time to choose where to eat and your reviews had me order from this place. I don't know if it is because I ordered at the beginning of dinner and was possibly served the leftovers of lunch but the fried rice and the chow mein were  very dry. The egg roll have a bad oder. And that's not the worst. The worst was when I found a booger with a hair still clinged to it on my chow mein. The garlic chicken and the sweet and sour chicken tasted fine. Because those two items tasted ok out of the five, I give it 2 stars. 1 1/2 star would have been more suitable due to that nasty, green, crispy booger on my dry mein.< /Review>< pics>

This is the worst Chinese food that I have ever had. I got the Chow Mein and Orange Chicken and neither satisfied me. The Chow Mein had no flavor what so ever and the Orange Chicken was breaded a way I have never seen before. I will not be going and I definitely will not recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

<text>Great service for phones.... Had to fix a cracked screen asap..  Even though store was closed, guy that was still inside attended to my device damages.. Had it fixed in less than 30 min. Might have been more or less but to have it done after store hours... Best electronic repair place in Long Beach!!!! 👍</text>< Date>

Long Beach Computer Repair is an excellent company. I had a computer problem that turned out to be a glitch. The rates are very fair and it comes with good customer service. If I have any future computer problems I will not hesitate to go back to them.

I highly recommend this company.< /Review>

Brought my computer for repairs they were very professional and helpful, I decided not to repair my old computer and they helped me transfer all my data to my new computer. I would highly recommend using this company for any computer needs, they were knowledgeable and helpful and the price was very reasonable.<//review>

We do charge a diagnostic fee as we are spending time on each individual unit. Unfortunately, we provide service and do not typically sell parts. It is unfortunate you feel our staff was rude as we pride ourselves in providing excellent customer service.

I had a hard drive failure on a business computer. To try to reinstall all of my proprietary software would have been a huge task. The guys at Long Beach Computer Repair were able to recover the hard drive in one day - saving me a lot of time and effort. They do great work at a great price. I highly recommend them.</review>

<review>They asked me for my password to my computer which I foolishly gave them. They went into my computer and now it will not connect to my Wi-Fi. My original problem was a button that was stuck to turn my computer on and off. They want to charge me $149 to save the data on my computer and make it possible for me to connect to my Wi-Fi again. Out of five stars I give them zero for their dishonesty.< /review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pics>

The initial issue at check in was in fact the button needed to be fixed. Once we opened the computer and corrected the button, we then realized there were other issues with the computer that needed attention. If further diagnostics would have been approved at that time, we could’ve most likely addressed the booting issues and WiFi issue as well. We often begin a diagnostic or repair on units and then run into other problems that may need to be repaired and are sure to inform our customers as we hope to send their units home completely functional. Again, we are truly sorry if any of this was miscommunicated or unclear.'}<//Response>< UserId.>

<Text>Really straightforward process, and the gentlemen I worked with were easy to work with and eager to answer questions.
Cost to fix a water damaged macbook was half of what apple store was going to charge me. The repair also was rly timely, they fixed it in less than 2 weeks and after not being able to use my macbook at all it works like new again.
The only issue I would say is that their free diagnostic signs are a little misleading because it's kind of vague. Since I had a hardware issue and not a software issue  I did have to pay to figure out what specifically was damaged on my mac. The diagnostic part is the only thing I'm not super happy about, but other than that I would definitely get every apple product fixed here because they work fast and their repair prices are reasonable.< /Text><username>Sabrina Williams< /username>< Gmap_id>

I was looking for a place to fix a virus that my laptop got. After calling and researching multiple places, this one was the most appealing. Great customer service and my laptop was fixed sooner than I expected. They don't try to rip you off like other places i been to. Definitely recommending this place to friends and family.< /Text>

It’s really just a great place.  Prices are fair and they are quick to diagnose any problems, get any parts and fix the issues.</Text>

Brought in a computer that was wet, they couldn't fix it but found a good replacement.  They have all taken the time to explain things.  Their analysis is free.  Then I brought in a bunch of old computers for them to transfer pictures.  I'll see how they do on that.  So far they are very helpful and personable.<//review>

They ran a free diagnostic and gave me a price for repair.  The next day I had a clean computer, and all my files and bookmarks backed up on my hard drive.  Great service, pleasant technicians and a reasonable price.  I highly recommend that you use them.</Text>< Pictures>

What a service! my friend recommend this to us.  Our daughter spilt water on her Apple Mac and it would not work.  With her assignment due the following day and no back up of her work all was lost!  Or at least we thought.  Long beach Computer Repair dropped everything and retrieved the data for us within a couple of hours!!  They are the nicest people who go out of their way to give excellent immediate service at very competitive prices.  I want to tell the world!</review>

I spend a whole day calling & looking for a good place to get my laptop screen repair in Long Beach, after going from shop to shop, best buy, fry's & some local shops, I call Long Beach Computer Repair & they offer me FREE diagnostic when other places charge you up to $80 for diagnosing you computer. They also offer me $10 OFF my total receipt. They repair my laptop, & best of all protected all my data that was on the hard drive the same day. Really happy with the customer service Esgar, the certified technician there, provided. Overall 5 stars!<//text>

I dropped off a pad to have a new charging port put in, They said it would take 3 to 5 days so I left it with them . On the 5th day I hadn't heard from them so I called them and they said the part had to be ordered and it would be another 5 days. By this time it's close to the end of the month and I'm on disability so I'm getting low on funds, I still had the money for the pad but it was about all I had, so I asked if I could pick it up on the first which was 2 days away and the guy began telling me the storage policy then put me on hold to speak with a manager.  When he returned to the call he said it would be fine. It had already been a really difficult last couple of months for me, on Feb 4th I had to report my girlfriend missing to the l.b.p.d. and my entire life was a wash, I've been beside myself,  I can't think, eat, sleep or basically function at all, as I said I'm already on disability and have many physical and mental problems.  I went in there to pick up the person said I would have to come back later in the day because it was a separate company, which I wasn't made aware of on the calls, I didn't know I had to be there at a certain time and he could tell I was already stressed and told me to hold on as he went into the back. A few minutes later a different guy comes out and is basically upset he had to come out early to give my pad back, and obviously I could see he wasn't happy but I just wanted my pad so I could get out of there and go home, and I did. I received the pad and asked for a bag to put it in because I had a mini laptop as well and I put both in the bag making sure the pad screen was on the outside. When I got home I took the pad out, and they had put one of those films over the scene,  like when you get a new phone it comes with the plastic film over the sceen, this one wasn't new so the film was all bubbly and you really couldn't see the sceen that well. As I took the film off I was shocked to see that the screen was hit or dropped, because it has a very specific hit point then is cracked from that hit point all the way to the other side of the screen.  There is no way this could have happened in that bag on a short walk home. Obviously I should have checked it in the store, but most places are always eager to show you the product they fixed for you, They want you to see it for yourself before you leave, They made no effort at all to do this in any way. When I called I was again told about the separate company and told to call back. I eventually spoke with the person and told them what had happened and he said they could fix it at whatever they would normally charge for that and truly seemed like he was teaching me a lesson,  I should have looked at it before I left he said several times, laughing and then becoming upset , totally unprofessional.  As I looked closer at my pad I see that they cut one corner with a knife or something,  it's all gapped up, to take the screen off I guess.  I have never dropped this pad ,ever, and there's a dent like mark on the same corner as the crack. Then I turn it on and it only has one button on the screen and it pushed in, it's no longer flush with the screen. It comes on and my sceen saver is gone and things look different,  They erased everything,  reset it. All my pics of my girlfriend and I together with our cats, videos of us, everything is gone. They never said anything to me about this at all. Why would they do this? Don't people usually copy everything that on there if they need to reset it, and don't they usually tell you first. I don't know what to do, I'm on disability and have no money for lawyers.  Everything is gone and these people truly seemed happy they got over on me. Do these people deserve the name long beach, or is this really what long beach is about., I just noticed that the screen is not on right, I can push it at the top and you can feel it push in and see it as well.< /text>

<text>Long story short....told them to call me back before january 21 for the pricing of repair because im going out the country and they call me january 24 to tell me to pick it up.. wow, (i told them im gonna be out of country)

Now there giving different price range to my wife on recovering the hard drive,  and there trying to charge for just a pick up without repair.

I just hope my wife will get the loptop out of there shop without any confusion and problem.
Thanks Josh for giving me a hard time.. i hope i dont get to step in your shop again when i get back.

There only great when your around but when your out of country and try to ask somebody to take care the loptop you drop off, there not so great...maybe because they know you can’t do anything through the phone.

Just remember josh, i live in long beach too, so i will always come home, after im done here.

Again thank you</text><Gmap_id>0x80dd339f1abe55c7:0x926c445f2b0c69cc</Gmap_id><username>Robert Cabradilla< /username><user_id>100484974663568969895</user_id></record>

It was quick and the customer service was great! They checked my oil before agreeing to do the oil change because they thought I could go a few extra miles before. I appreciated that they did not want me to pay for something I didn't need.<//review>

<Review>Very friendly and knowledgeable staff,affordable prices,will be a returning customer!!

UPDATE:2/25/19
I must take my 5 stars back...
NEVER RETURNING HERE AGAIN....
On jan.17th,19 I got a oil change as I have done many times at this location. Fast forward to 2.7.19 woke up to a flat tire so I took it in to a tire shop,the worker asked me "who did your oil change because they left the "O" ring off causing a oil spill all over under the hood" ..That was so irresponsible..I had to pay for another oil change,another air filter and O ring<//Review>< time>

The service was good and they were decent. My only issues is the price. It's extremely over priced compared other Oil Change places. I was charged $83.00. I could easily get the same service less then a few miles away for half that!</review>

Come here for honest mechanics - they have turned me down previously for an unneeded oil change. Plus - everytime I come in for an oil change they always fill up all my fluids, tires, change out any needed filters. Plus the mechanics are friendly. Quick and easy as well.<//Review>

< review>
So I have regularly had my oil changed here for years. Today was no different EXCEPT, my car sounded terrible after I left (banging sound). I saw a plastic pannel hanging in the undercarriage. I thought they might have forgotten to re-attach the panel after the oil change, so I drove back for correction.  Regardless of what the problem was, the tech stepped up for a fight with me because I rejected his suggestion that I 'RAN OVER SOMETHING'. Never going back, but going to Mercedes dealer to see what they ruined in my car.<//review>

Great experience, quick service and great customer service. They did my oil power steering fluid,rear diff fluids. The customers complaining about being upsold, its mere suggestions. There's no pressure to receive more/less than what you ask. If all you want is an oil change with plain Jane oil that's exactly what you'll get. The staff is knowledgeable and will not recommend anything they feel isn't worth mentioning, at the end of the day they are just offering the best they can in customer service. Answer their surveys and you get a $20 off coupon for your next visit.< /Review>

i got a very bad experience here, had a change oil the morning and they forgot to screw the underbody screw tray resulting of it falling down on the highway and had to comeback to let them fix it which took me 30 mins wait. the person told me they may have forgot to return it. Deng my trip was delayed resulting for me not to be ontine for a gathering. i will not go here anymore. they did not even check all my lights either. bad service.</text>

<Review>Every time I go here I get a new technician working on my car, and each person that I deal with, has been rude or impatient that I don't know their process.  They always seem frustrated with me that I don't know the one and outs of my car and that I don't want every upsell that they offer.  Been here maybe 10 times since I've loved in Alameda and it's always the same.  Unfortunately it's the only quick change facility near me and I need to keep going because I can't take time off work to take it to a proper mechanic.< /Review><UserId.>105701195327694453697<//UserId.><date>1593107404438<//date><rating>2</rating>< pictures>

<Text>The service has gotten worse since the original crew was manning this Oil Changers in Alameda. They try and upsell from the start when they can clearly see your service history when they look up your license plate. Trying to add unnecessary services when we know our own vehicle does not warrant an upsell. All about attitude during these COVID times; no need to be cranky when you provide an essential service and are getting paid when most people aren't able to work.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1597435661889, 'text': "Hi there, we're sorry to hear that and take your feedback seriously.

Needed an oil change and there were 2 cars ahead of me. It was about a 40 minute wait but it was worth it. I got my oil filter cleaned and changed for a fair price but the kicker was they washed my windshield, checked my tire pressure, filled my window fluid, and everything else for free. Like, I can't even exaggerate that this has been the best car service I have ever gotten, not only because they did those things, but because everyone who worked there was so nice! They chatted with me, and made sure I knew what was happening and the staff had great energy. 15/10 experience. Seriously, best service Ive ever gotten, and not even just for an oil change.</Text>

I’ve reviewed these folks on Yelp and have told them directly that I really like the service here. I take advantage of their “4 oil changes for the price of three” and find their prices reasonable.

I’ve rarely had to wait more than about ten minutes and they really do decent and thoughtful customer service. One example is that I recently took advantage of their “free fluids tipoffs between changes” when I was going on a longer trip. On that day it was very busy so they had me pull up at the exit, continued servicing their full change customers, and managed to check my fluids, add some oil, inflate a couple of low tires, and wish me pleasantly on my way.

They operate like an efficient production line and, if there’s any slouches there, you’d never know it. Everyone seems to know and do their jobs well and I time is wasted. They provide you with accurate information as a matter of routine and they are open to any questions you may have. They’re busy but you as a customer are not rushed.

This is a decently run business with well trained, customer friendly staff who know and do their jobs well. I will keep coming back and highly recommend their services.< /Text>

<Text>Superb customer services and fastest oil changes ever! In and out. I wasn't even there for 7 minutes. They worked together like a pit crew. Got my windows cleaned my lights check and oil changed all at the same time. The people that helped me out knew what they were talking about and didn't try up selling me on a bunch of things I don't need. My car was making a funky sound and they asked me about it and even checked under the hood for me. They made it simple and easy to understand what was going on with my car. Anytime my car needs something, I'm coming here first, I STRONGLY recommend you do the same.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This is my new favorite place to get my oil changed! The technicians were friendly, quick, knowledgeable, and helpful. Kimbe and Shawn were great- they answered some questions I had about my car maintenance and provided recommendations that were actually useful. Too often I feel that oil changing places are trying to get you to pay for extra, unnecessary services, but I didn't get this from my recent visit to Oil Changers. Thanks so much guys, I'll be back!<//Review>

If you come early in the morning there's almost never anyone there and you can leave your car to be worked on while you go grab a coffee nearby. The managers are very nice and helpful. Sometimes some of the other employees seem a bit grumpy or unhappy to be there but they're never really rude and the other work they do is good, so don't let it put you off. Nothing spectacular but a good, easy spot to do oil changes and the like<//Text>< Pics>

Super unprofessional bunch of young immature kids that work there it didn't seem they knew what they were doing I overheard them saying they lost an oil drain plug on the customers vehicle before me. Stay away I sat there for an hour watching the way they conduct themselves. They where yelling and cussing at each other one guy was telling another guy to tuck in his shirt in while waiting to get my coolant flush and I just decided I don't want them touching my vehicle after pulling up and then gave me attitude about pulling up a little bit too far. No punk kids are going to talk to me that way with that disrespect. Upper management needs to fire that whole crew and restructure because that's definitely not how you run a business. Definitely not a way to treat your veterans such  utter disrespect on all levels< /Review>

<review>UPDATE: the car is leaking oil, so I check it, and it's very overfilled. Did they not even look up the specs for my car??

I agree with the other review--the beanie accent guy complained the entire time about his job/pay/about the lady in the other car being in a bad mood/having to clean the shop/how much people spent on their cars.
It was uncomfortable for the poor lady, no wonder she was pissed.

Nobody seemed to know what they were doing. Maybe it's a different experience when different employees are there, but I'm not willing to risk it on my next oil change, especially not at that price point.

They also charged for window washing and never touched my windows. I realized after pulling away, but the hassle wasn't worth my time.

If I owned this shop, this is all stuff I'd want to know. More than unprofessional, just all-around careless, shoddy work.</review>< Response>

The slowest (45 min to change the oil and filter on the car ahead of me and 40 min to do mine.) Place I've ever been to. By the time I saw the situation I was stuck and could not back out. Seems the employees who work well went to lunch as I got there. One guy with a beanie and accent got there late and instead of getting in and helping took another worker and disappeared on the side of the building for 15 min. Then spent more time talking then doing. He overfilled my engine with oil. Then two of them argued who was going to drain the extra. The young man with cornrows who started on my vehicle was either very stupid or very stoned.  Entered everything wrong on the computer so Mr. Talks-a-lot had to fix it. After that Mr cornrows decides he is going to grab his coat and go have a smoke. No matter that they are short handed. Another worker decides its more important to get his home stereo out of his car and hook that up with no regard to the line of cars or how long everything is taking. The only upside is that I was in a company vehicle and on the clock. Will never go there again.</review>

<Text>I have been coming from San Leandro to get my oil changed here for several years, in three different vehicles. Until today I have always received very good service. I was there at 8am for the open, which was late... I asked for an oil change and it was time for a radiator flush, which was why I was there early. The single person there did not know how to do the flush and said his manager would be in at 11am. Advice: if you want to keep business regulars, be able to do the services you advertise, or lose long time customers like me.

< Review>
I like this place. I went there today with my older Caravan for an oil change and they took care of that and few other things I'd been neglecting, like wiper blades that were so old I could barely see when it rains. The service was quick, professional, and a lot less expensive than it would have been if I'd gone to a dealership for the same work. The people running the shop were on-task and friendly - just what I hoped to find in Alameda.</Review>

<Review>I've been coming here for a few years.  I believe since it opened.  I noticed that everytime the manager "Veronica" was not in, the productivity would slow down.

When she was there, the wait time plus service at best, was 30 minutes.  AT BEST.  Veronica ran a tight ship!!#

Today she was not there.  I waited 20 minutes to get the stall, which smelled of "MaryJane", waited another 10 minutes because the service provider was chatting up with his girlfriend which was the car that was ahead of me getting serviced.

I finally asked to be let out because the service provider was  blocking my path talking to his girlfriend and not doing the oil change I was there to get.

That's to bad that such a cool spot can't be run by service providers that appreciate the money but especially people's time.

Furthermore, smoking weed on the job while servicing people's cars is, not cool or safe!!

I'm paying for prefessional work.

It's a good thing I can work on cars.  Sometimes however, I don't have the energy.  Hence paying for service.  Good service, not the service Oil Changers or their management think I'm worth.

Recommendation for owner:  You still have time to get it together.  Trust me the City of Alameda will ensure you do.

Really disappointed by my phone interaction. Just called in to find out how much an oil change would be. Had to repeat myself multiple times and was then accused of giving them attitude.< /text>

The manager at Oil Changers Alameda store, Shawn Hamilton, is an angry, rude and arrogant man - with very little respect for customers, or his coworker at the time. It astounds me that Oil Changers would put that man in a position of management, interacting with customers. After many visits to Oil changers Alameda store, I will be taking my business elsewhere. My wife quit that store years ago after being offended by someone - unknown if it was the same man.</Text>

It is not 10 min oil change. The staff are very slow and it takes at least an hour. So when trying this place, make sure you have at least an hour.</text>

We offer an array of maintenance services which tend to be more time, a regular oil change is about 15 min but if more services such as opening up undercarriage for any additional service takes more time . Every scenario is different and we are on a 1st come 1st serve basis and  service the entire bay area so we are working to expand our teams to better serve our customers.\nWe apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate you letting us know so we may help correct this .\nIf you ever have any issues of this sort at the time of service, please give us a quick call at the corporate office so we may correct any issue in real time.\nRegional Manager can always help assist in any issue and is available at Region1@oilchangers.com or Call our Corporate Office to speak with regional at 1(800)640-2405\nThank You for your feedback\nThe Oil Changers Google Help Desk'}<//response>

<Date>1616612356959< /Date><rate>5< /rate><text>We stopped in there. Hardly anyone on the makeshift patio area out front. We got helped quickly and our table was sterilized before we sat down.
There was a nice breeze from the street.

We had Lasagna and antipasto salad. The salad was robust and tasty as usual. Enough to serve 4 people. The lasagna was good and well cooked.

The small salad was about $18 and the small lasagna was $35.

Atmosphere was good and food was good as always. !< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjVfqmfZTNAIbWdrOPhDwykqkvJgft-9iP_6W-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI4rD_MMo7yjE4PN04gxSEfO5J8oeMbJs4Xi07=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuagdMZFuoTEVR1_1MwQr_bUT-KV9ArMbNSFdZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7JdbzrBbxcm0G9cGz-FSl05uRf6RpfBd885zq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh202GOokEbyyAddi_lLI3bxelwrLQTmw8SQsu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuWg6PRKRjHD6-TOQDeBEXWo-bqaP9SxYwOonE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3QAASIVMh-jcUNp9eDG1gc5Xgd9GVnMlDswNY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIBr91poFu7U0aeI8pRD_edw0IrQOeMtLLGSTK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO72eupFMM7jwCOhoqIzk56OZ6QB6b2AIYkP9JT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3vsm3aZNKg5kfFcLtzE31A7mwo66eIz91WtZ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh_n4q2YWLqVG05NCb-G298dJCg9KQ1A843B-m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjIFw5Xw-N6z1urQjfkAyjKePmxqWbtoKQqUuN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsnBN-L_btW70j2-AGQvNDwI9AEPuvU32unwiS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6PR_xqSYQvnMR_6Mnx3xQyapRWvBMekNQxu6l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPo2l1LtX998uAz0mNCyneDYXjq56tz1DXe3XQG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk7e5xBzz-sk5rRKVWdGWG1H1pHmsxEwInxNCp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmXYtK0rPwmLo24bNBm16RCiYLcQUmPUknl5ED=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

The server helped us along the way and we ordered chicken piccatta, mozzarella bread, and a small side of fettuccine.  We also get a wine of Coppola chardonnay.  The server poured olive oil and balsamic vinegar for our bread to dip and poured our wine glasses.  Everything was served family style.  The food and service was excellent.  The ambiance was nice and we had a great time.< /text>< name>

I made same day reservations online, walked in waited 2 minutes and they brought us to our table. Our server was pleasant. The food was good as usual at this location, but man the prices have gone up since last time we were here.  $18 for a slice of cake. Large spaghetti with meat sauce $45, it supposedly serves 5... only if they are 2 adults and 3 kids in my opinion.<//Text>

I adore the family-style concept! This is a great restaurant for birthdays, banquets, and larger group gatherings. The servers here are very friendly and willing to accommodate (to the best of their abilities) for food restrictions.</Review>

For Easter time get the Linguine with Clams or the Shrimp Scampi. I reccomend adding extra garlic. Unfortunately Bucca di Beppo only serves these at this time of year. Take a piece of bread and soak up the sauce. It's a treat.

There were only 3 tables taken when my party arrived. It's a bit chilli so I asked if they could provide another spare heater since they had so many around. Our waitress said she couldn't because they wouldn't be enough for other guest. Mind you the place is empty. They could've easily place an extra one and removed it if it were needed elsewhere. Will not be be coming back.</text>

My family loves Buca. We typically come for birthdays, we've come for Xmas and Thanksgiving with the whole extended family. Everyone always really enjoys the food. It's nice to go with a bigger party so you can get more options with the family style service. My son loves the ravioli with meat sauce, my mom loves the fettuccine, my dad and I love the carbonara, everyone loves the manicotti, canneloni, salads and warm bread. Because we usually spend birthdays here we're always treated with huge cakes and brownies and piles of ice cream, it's very tasty and makes the celebration more special.
I'd recommend this place for any special occasion or just a delicious family style meal with your home. They do great with take out orders and have curbside available. There's constantly great deals running with their eclub so join that before you go or check your email for deals. We really enjoyed the 50% off orders of ravioli for national ravioli day 2021!! A large order with salad and bread was enough for my family of 4 to eat once for dinner and once for lunch!</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Yesterday was the first time for my husband and myself visiting this restaurant. We ordered fettuccine alfredo, garlic mozzarella bread, pepperoni pizza and two sodas. The waitress was friendly and attentive, however the food was not good at all. The pasta was missing salt and flavor. It tasted like microwave food. We asked for salt. But that didn't do the trick. The pizza is not worth 24 bucks. And it is not for 3 people, maybe 3 small children. The garlic bread was okay. When the bill came it was 80 bucks and I was very disappointed to pay for that price when the food was not even good. We left a tip because the server was great, but sadly we will not be returning to this place.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Food was decent; one serving was for two. Extremely generous portions. I don't recommend two different dinners, you will pay about $100.00 for two that you can't finish...</Review>

They obviously took more orders than they could handle out of greed. They also ran out of mashed potatoes so we were told to pick something else.  Did not really want spaghetti with turkey but were told if we got anything else it would take even longer. Turkey was ok stuffing was extremely dry.

Family style portions...buyer beware, lol. Look, this is the opportune spot for parties of 3 or more, conversations and shared checks. The menu has enough of a variety for everyone. Julio took care of my family, stayed in range and served us well. Desserts are so good too. Colossal Sundae is as it seems...3 or more to kill it...enjoy!<//Review>

<review>Eh, nothing special.  Haven't been here for a long time and it has gone downhill a bit. In our group we had chicken marsala, lasagne, another chicken dish and an antipasto salad.  The food is decent but not fantastic. If you go there as a couple on your own, you will find none of the selctions are for two people,  which although you get way too much food, but you will pay for it.<//review>< user_id>

< Review>
I made same day reservations online, walked in waited 2 minutes and they brought us to our table. Our server was pleasant. The food was good as usual at this location, but man the prices have gone up since last time we were here.  $18 for a slice of cake. Large spaghetti with meat sauce $45, it supposedly serves 5... only if they are 2 adults and 3 kids in my opinion.<//Review>

We had a wonderful time! The server Edith was so sweet that she quickly introduced herself to us with a smile. The bartender Julio made some great drinks and Ema made sure we had our food on the spot. Jennifer came to ensure our stay was successful and other servers were as friendly and helpful throughout the night. The food was not only well-plated, but wonderful!<//review>

<UserId.>100673490260665066006< /UserId.><review>Went here with my mother who wanted to try the Cioppino as she loves a good seafood stew or soup, she enjoyed it. It is a big serving the menu says can be shared by two and I agree my mom took leftovers, as for me I had Linguini Seafood in white sauce and that was very good. For both dishes the seafood was cooked perfectly. They have outside seating and the staff was very attentive. Would recommend plan on going back and taking my husband.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

The food and the service was excellent. The problem is you can only buy huge portions. I understand you can take home leftovers and  come with 3 or more people. I don't feel like this is a good restaurant for 2 people dining. They should have dinners for 2. These are "first world problems" . But if you don't have at least 3 people this is not a good value. We wanted some garlic cheese bread and mind you it was delicious but 2 people don't need 12 pieces 😁< /review>

They are known for their awesome big dishes!! Their meatball and spaghetti is an awesome dish!! The size of the meatballs is ridiculous and the portions are ridiculous as well. If your coming here just know that your going to eat it again the next day!! Haha!!</Review>

Celebrated my buddies birthday in the special kitchen side booth. I suggest asking for it if you are in a group of four or less and want some good quality food and privacy .< /Review>

<review>Solid food. Restrooms are amazingly clean. My family got the eggplant and it was fantastic. The food was cooked decently with an amazing flavor. Only thing was I didn't like the bread, it didn't taste good and had a weird aftertaste. The sharing aspect with the family servings gives the restaurant a good feeling and contributes to the theme. Definitely will return when I can.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Absolutely the worst Italian food I have ever eaten.   I have been to 2 of their restaurants on 3 different occasions, but the time we were there on Thanksgiving (I know, there is nothing like mom's home cooking) in 2018 was due to a family snafu.  Our reservations were for 2PM and surprisingly, we were seated almost immediately.  That's where the good part ends and the bad begins.  My wife and good friend and I ordered 4 family style dishes.  I recall one was the shrimp pasta.    The white sauce was watery and I think there were only 6 shrimp in the entire bowl.  As for flavor?  Yuck!  I will NEVER go back to this restaurant.  And at the same time, it seems like it is always busy!  Maybe the bar is serving lots of drinks before the food comes?  All I know is, it is terrible.  Fool me once...</Review>

I love Buca di Beppo and I was very excited to dine here but there are two major issues. One is my server Julio was terrible and extremely arrogant and the main problem is as one person I’m not looking to order a portion of food for three people and let alone spend $30 for a pasta dish for three, $24 for a salad for three, $15 for garlic bread for three. It’s just WAY too much food for one person and I’m not looking for leftovers. Nothing is that high end to warrant that high of a price and I don’t want to waste that much food nor pay that much to throw more than half of my food away. This might be a great spot if you have a large group but hugely disappointing if you dine alone.< /review>

The 6 of us had a great time here but that's because we're all friends who were coming together for a reunion. If you're looking for great food, this place isn't it. You're paying for atmosphere, and shtick. The food is mediocre at best which is why many of us hadn't revisited in over 10 years. Half of our table were vegetarians, but Buca is NOT vegetarian friendly, so just know this when you're making your reservations. Italian food offers an array of delicious vegetarian dishes, so we didn't even give thought that this might be an issue. Sadly, it was. Our server, Kyle, was amazing and very helpful and engaged in our banter.</Review>

We had the cioppino which was amazing!  Loved it. That is all we had.  Plenty for two. So, food was 4-Star. Noisy and crowded as well (small, narrow) which could be bad for some people.</Review>

I was a bit disappointed to be honest. The Mozzarella Garlic Bread was delicious. We ordered a Caesar Salad but the parmesan was that powdered heavily preserved parmesan stuff. I asked them if they had grated Parmesan but they said that powered parmesan is all they use. I find that sad for a supposed Italian restaurant. They also had a lot of mysogenistic and degrading photos hanging on the wall.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>Great food, huge servings ( meant for 2 or 4). The stuffed mushroom appetizer is the best I've ever had it has a creamy pesto sauce that it sits in which is delicious! We sat in the private booth in the kitchen area which is actually really fun and not noisy and hectic like I thought it was going to be. It was my birthday dinner from my best friend, I enjoyed it a lot.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Wow, I love Italian food, and in really picky about Italian because I cook a lot of their cuisine.  I came here with some good friends, first point you can make a reservation!  Decor is like a smorgasbord of everything including some hideous carpet lol.  Our waitress and service were above excellent, you could tell she was a pro at people, and what the restaurant offered.  The most important part to me though, the food!  We had the manicotti, I mean the melt in your mouth dream pasta.  We had the chopped antipasto salad, this was flavorful and the perfect amount of dressing, good bits of pepperoni a good salad.  Then we had a special shrimp pasta, and it had a great balance of sweet and savory and the shrimp were perfect.  I hope everyone gets a chance to eat here it is a great experience, just make sure you are hungry and don't mind sharing from a big platter.</text>

<review>Beyond redemption.  Go to a different location it's worth the drive.  Bad service and bad food. We had to wait to eat because two of our three person party had no silverware.  We eventually flagged someone down for silverware. I got the new appetizer item-fried shrimp with pepperoncinis. I love spicy. I tried a bite and it hit my tummy I knew I needed to wait on it. I had to get up and be sick. It was like out of a movie-puking after one bite. My stomach knew something was in that that needed to be OUT immediately. I could taste the 'too old' old oil.  My daughter didn't touch her watery spaghetti and that kid usually shovels spaghetti in. I'm really suprised at the sub-par quality. It felt like everyone was just too busy to slow down and check quality. Way too rushed.  I've been to other locations with no issues.<//review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Great experience, great food, and great customer service. Waiters/servers were on point and really helpful.  The bucca di beppo staff even brought extra personal ice cream bowls to my two other kids when they brought out the personal birthday icecream bowl and then sang a birthday song for my birthday boy. I thought that was really something, thanks Bucca di beppo. We will definitely be coming back for more.  Loved the pizza, fried calamari, fettuccini alfredo and the garlic bread. Ten out of ten for everything. They even had a photographer take pictures and give us a postcard for free. Pictures for fifteen dollars for one and ten dollars each when you buy two or more. What a way to spend a Christmas eve dinner. Thank you for a wonderful experience!!!</Review>

The pasta had no taste I had to keep adding salt to give it some flavor, there was never one  smiles from our waiter we were totally disappointed!
We dont mind paying a high price for excellent food and excellent service but we did not get what we paid for! Poor service and less than satisfactory food. This place is totally overrated. Will Not go back<//text>

The service was awesome! Portions are massive and great for sharing with a large group. The food was good, but not great. I attended a birthday celebration with family and we all enjoyed ourselves. The restaurant allowed us to bring in a birthday cake we purchased from a bakery and brought the cake out and sang to the birthday boy when the time came. Overall nice experience. Would definitely go back.</Text>

<Review>We ordered their lemon chicken (chicken picata basically) and spaghetti with marinara sauce. The chicken was ok but the pasta was very bland. Overall it's way too expensive. The decor sets a fun vibe and the music was good. Our server was a busy man. Poor guy had to bus tables in addition to his server duties, but he did a professional job for us.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1578058284749, 'text': 'Thank you, Mark, for choosing Buca di Beppo.

We celebrated our wedding with Buca di Beppo in Huntington Beach and it was amazing. From our first encounter with Alfonso, our experience was awesome. He was easy to reach and always available. Alfonso helped the process flow as easy as possible. From menu changes, time changes and decorations, we never had an issue. Alfonso was always so willing to help meet our accomodations. Thank you Alfonso for everything you have done. We grately appreciate it.

The day of our event, we were an hour earlier than expected, yet the staff was so willing to still seat and serve us. The manager Gabby, was in charge during our event and we were very pleased. Our party played music and we're a little loud, yet the managers approach was very professional. Thank you Gabby for being such a great host.

Our head server Tina, Kylie and Augustine were amazing. Our party guest never went with an empty cup and always full of food. With our guest count, they were fast and extremely patient with our extra needs. Very grateful for their services on a day that meant so much to us.

Thank you Buca di Beppo for such an amazing time. Looking forward to host more events with you guys.<//text>< pics>

<Review>We came in as party of 3, non busy hour there were nobody in restaurant, but told us to wait. We waited 15min until we were directed by hostess who never talked to us while we were walking inside the dining room, toward upstairs, not even at the table we sat at. She did not tell us who the server was, any specialty items on menu, nor asked us if we have been there before. And then we waited again for another 10min, nobody came to us at all. There was noone in the dining room, nor guests. So we just simply left because we were not about to start and end our dinner with already bad experience. We did not even try to explain back at podium because we did not feel welcomed in the beginning anyways. I dont think we will be back to this restaurant again.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dd2642223c9b3f:0xffdd17e1fb8e2ba5< /gmapID><rate>1<//rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1580698159383</time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The food at Buca is always good, but this wasn't my best experience. The pizza we wanted to order we were told would take 30 minutes to cook (why wasn't this indicated on the menu - we could have ordered it earlier - we were there for 15-20 minutes waiting for everyone to arrive) so we had to order a different pizza.  Then one of the special pastas we ordered when we placed our full 4 dish order - the server came back about 15 minutes later to let us know they were out of it. Why did it take 15 minutes to find that out?!?! And now having to place a new pasta order 15 minutes later and wait 15 minutes for it to be ready we could've ordered that 30 minute pizza after all.  The food we got was very tasty and the service was actually great outside of the strangeness of the 15 minute delay on letting us know the pasta we wanted wasn't available, but I was overall disappointed since the two dishes I was most excited about we ultimately couldn't get.< /Review>< Date>

so bad. not sure what it is about this one, but the food is awful. I thought it was just me, but after speaking to neighbors I guess its known as "the bad one". the service is great, the people are all great,  so its nothing against them...the food though. ugh, I cant believe I'm gna say this, but I'd rather go to olive garden...<//Review>

Great food but the server was not very honest. We had a group of 7 and we were not familiar with the place. We ordered 4 large pasta items to split and the server gave us no warning on portions. We had enough food to feed the whole restaurant! Not only the quantity of food but the price was outrageous for that. It would've been helpful If he told us they were huge portions!<//review>

< Review>
Food was great. Service was terrible with Floyd. Floyd could never been found. Took 10 minutes to get acknowledged to order drinks. By the time Floyd came to the table we already knew what we wanted to order as we have been to Buca before. Received appetizer timely than received the pizza that we ordered. This whole time never once saw Floyd. We have had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. We waited almost 10 minutes before Floyd acknowledged that we hadn't received are pasta. Floyd left and came back said it would be another few minutes. We waited probably another 10 minutes before we received our pasta. Never did Floyd come by to check on us. We where going to order desert but since everything took so long to receive we opted out of not ordering it. The check came and I wanted almost 10 minutes again to get my change back. Needless to say dont have Floyd as your waiter as he disappears and he is never to be found. If I saw a manager on the way out of us leaving i would have stopped them and told them how horrible are service was.<//Review>

<review>Ordered takeout so only commenting on the food.
Had ordered for 6 people and was a bit surprised to see how small the containers were. However, it ended up being packed tight and enough to feed my family of 6 for two days. Great both fresh and reheated. Probably making this my go-to place for Italian for the family.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
We had a party of 16 people arriving for our family event later that evening the Management was very accommodating and made sure we were comfortable while we waited for everyone to arrive. Due to traffic on a Friday night many people were late but what mattered the most was that when everyone arrived the food poured out as if the kitchen staff was there just for us.! our waitress was super professional and made sure everyone was satiated and happy! Thanks A lot. the only thing better than the attention the staff gave us was the food!! many thanks!< /Review>

They weren't too busy on a Saturday night but one of their ovens went down so the food took 35 minutes to arrive after we had ordered and they were way behind on the garlic bread so a number of tables did not get any.  Our server was friendly and the food was decent.<//Review>

Had a big family dinner on Saturday night. Food was awesome, love the ravioli, but my favorite part was the service. Tina, was our server, loved her! Friendly, fun, and very thorough. She made us all smile. Glasses were kept full and she was a hit with the kids, the cannoli was a great idea for them, easy for small hands to manage. Thank you for helping us make great memories! Looking forward to doing it again.</Review>

Service was terrible. Had to wait for Julio the server because he was watching football on the bar tv. Went upstairs to use the facilities and while coming down, a server rudely cut me off. I said to him, "wow that was rude". He didn't even know what I was talking about. Food is over priced and over rated.< /Review>

Honestly I'm unhappy about spending $100, on a Cesar salad, Fettuccine alfredo with chicken extra $7 for 6oz of chicken, a beer , wine and I was tricked into purchasing garlic bread thanks to an awful server. She asked if we'd like some bread to go with our salad ,we replied yes then turns out $12 for garlic bread.... instead of giving us house bread. Yeah, I'm not planning on returning after this, Even the food was cold when it came. Sorry but the pasta didnt even had flavor, How!</text>

<Review>I made a reservation before arriving to the restaurant two hours ahead , Inspite of that they let’s wait more than 20 mins. The coffee was cold , I returned twice but no way to have it hot !!!!
No big choices of steak , seafood ( I know it’s an Italian restaurant , but still can have at least one kind of steak !!!!)
The food take too long to be prepared and having it , more than 20 mins. for one dish of appetizer!!!
The service is poor , and the place is not too much as I heard of it .....!!!!!
Besides the prices for the dishes are highly expensive for an restaurant not really high recommended.< /Review>< name>

<Text>They've raised their prices on the dinner menu, and a "large" order of mozzarella garlic bread is now $15, which is 8 pieces, IE: 2 loves if their small bread cut into half, then cut again diagonally.  It's good, still, but not that good.

Not sure if the lunch menu went up, but unlike dinner, you get dinner, but compared with dinner, you get less in 2 portions than you do in the dinner small, which serves 3 for about the same price as 2 at lunch.

Still, they do have the absolute best chocolate cake ever, even though it is $15, but it can serve 2-3.< /Text>< Pictures>

Do not go to this restaurant solo as they only make food for families. Imagine my surprise when the owner responded to me and said you cant have an "Authentic Italian" dinner with out lots of food. Tell that to all my single Italian friends and old Italian widows. Stupidest thing I ever heard. I will never return for even a drink.<//text>

I would not go to this location again. We had an awful experience and are very disgusted with the atmosphere. When we waited for our food we noticed that there were large gnats flying around our heads. At first the waiter didn't believe us, until we started killing them with napkins. It made us completely lose our appetites and asked to pack up our food and leave. The waiter understood our wishes and gave us credit on one of our meals. I will not be returning to this establishment again. Also the food isn't even that great for the price you are paying.<//Text>

Don't go to this restaurant solo. They ONLY make servings of food for 3+ people including appetizers and salads. When the menu says family style it means they do not make anything for just one person. Bring your family.</review>

We love this place for the comfort food and quirky, festive ambience! The baked ziti is loaded with melted cheese and sauce - none of us can stop eating it once we start. Also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs - meatballs are large and tasty with a generous amount of spaghetti and sauce.< /text>

The food was good. They have plenty of options to choose from even for vegetarians.
The service was very good the host was engaging and the server was friendly and prompt.
The location parking was not great, very busy at 1pm so getting out was a hassle.
The restaurant was clean and so were  the bathrooms.
The prices for the food was not too high on the lunch menu.
The main menu was more pricey but  an entree could serve two people for the price of one which is a good deal.<//review>

Good family restaurant..served family style. Helpful staff. Crowded most of the times I have been here which is a down side. Unfortunately can't give if 5 stars as we had reservations and still waited 45 minutes.  No acknowledge from management? At least a courtesy apology..no problems with food< /Review>

Honestly I'm unhappy about spending $100, on a Cesar salad, Fettuccine alfredo with chicken extra $7 for 6oz of chicken, a beer , wine and I was tricked into purchasing garlic bread thanks to an awful server. She asked if we'd like some bread to go with our salad ,we replied yes then turns out $12 for garlic bread.... instead of giving us house bread. Yeah, I'm not planning on returning after this, Even the food was cold when it came. Sorry but the pasta didnt even had flavor, How!</Review>

Sit in Tina's section! I had one of the best times ever in a restaurant. She made sure that we were ok. I hate it when I can never find a server during the meal. She knew we needed something, and brought it out, before even we knew or could ask for it.<//text>

< Review>
One of the worst experiences I've ever had. I placed an order via online at 3: 30 for 5 p. M. Pick up. I got there at 4: 45 and every 5 minutes they kept telling me just a few more minutes. it was until I told the host I was possibly going to cancel my order did my food magically appear at 5: 30 p. M.. I asked the girl that brought my food out what's the point In placing a order online for a specific Time if they can get the order ready on time. And not to mention online it asks you for your phone number in case they need to contact you. never once did I get a phone call letting me know my order was going to be delayed. And then their final answer for why it was so late was "a Cook called out in the morning...." so what they're telling me is a cook calls out in the morning an order is put in at 3: 30 and they can't possibly get that done before 5 p. M.. and no one has a competents for capability to call the guest and let them know that order will be delayed. and never once did the manager come out to apologize or offer a discount or even a free dessert for the inconvenience great job Buca I will definitely dine  elsewhere from now on..... No wonder why your hardly ever busy.....<//Review>

Love the giant 1/2 lb. meatballs. We stop by and buy 3 at a time to go.  They are delicious and come with plenty of sauce and a "loaf" of bread. They are quite hot and come in a foil pan for reheating or freezing.
On my scale they are expensive but worth it. The go with so many meals at home and are great in sandwiches.  They are a much better discounted price when purchased three at a time.
You can of course join online and receive very good and frequent discounted offers.<//Text>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Was not thrilled. There were 4 of us. Sat us at a very small table up against the wall in the pope room. The waiter was very nice but the food was very slow. We got bread first. Then a salad. We were waiting for quite some time, then one of the waitresses cleared our plates and asked if we wanted more bread. Then we had a guy come up to take our pictures for a free postcard. Probably about 15 min later we got our food which was very good but a very long wait. After dinner we needed a box, we had a loaf of bread left but it was taken away and not asked if we wanted it. Then the guy come with the post card and 6 ea 5 X 7 pictures that he was selling for $10.00 ea if u buy more then 2. Very expensive dinner. Over 150.00 and $20.00 for pics. Just not the atmosphere we were hoping for. Pretty nosey too<//review>< Pics>

<review>great and lots of food,  variety of dessert options,  awesome service help from our new friend here (Taenna);
If it is a special occasion such as my experience, I strongly recommend this place and location;

Sat us at a very small table up against the wall in the pope room. The waiter was very nice but the food was very slow. We got bread first. Then a salad. We were waiting for quite some time, then one of the waitresses cleared our plates and asked if we wanted more bread. Then we had a guy come up to take our pictures for a free postcard. Probably about 15 min later we got our food which was very good but a very long wait. After dinner we needed a box, we had a loaf of bread left but it was taken away and not asked if we wanted it. Then the guy come with the post card and 6 ea 5 X 7 pictures that he was selling for $10.00 ea if u buy more then 2. Very expensive dinner. Over 150.00 and $20.00 for pics. Just not the atmosphere we were hoping for. Pretty nosey too< /Review><rate>3<//rate>< date>

Buca is a great place to go if you have large group.  The portion sizes are large.  Gigantic by average standards. The restaurant's playful atmosphere and many groups make it,  loud and fun but also remember to book a reservation in advance or you will be waiting a long time. No fast food here.  Slow family dinners.</Text>

A pretty good restaurant for Italian food to meet family and friends. Very interesting interior full of images of Italian culture. I got discounted  gift cards from costco for this place 😁<//review>

<Review>One of the worst experiences I've ever had. I placed an order via online at 3: 30 for 5 p. M. Pick up. I got there at 4: 45 and every 5 minutes they kept telling me just a few more minutes. it was until I told the host I was possibly going to cancel my order did my food magically appear at 5: 30 p. M.. I asked the girl that brought my food out what's the point In placing a order online for a specific Time if they can get the order ready on time. And not to mention online it asks you for your phone number in case they need to contact you. never once did I get a phone call letting me know my order was going to be delayed. And then their final answer for why it was so late was "a Cook called out in the morning...." so what they're telling me is a cook calls out in the morning an order is put in at 3: 30 and they can't possibly get that done before 5 p. M.. and no one has a competents for capability to call the guest and let them know that order will be delayed. and never once did the manager come out to apologize or offer a discount or even a free dessert for the inconvenience great job Buca I will definitely dine  elsewhere from now on..... No wonder why your hardly ever busy.....< /Review>< Resp>

Loved the family style food. We tried the new  stuffed chicken. The appetizers were tasty. The brussel sprouts were amazing with flavor. My friends liked their sparkling sangria drinks. Definitely coming back to eat here. We had the best server named Andreas. He made sure we had drinks filled constantly and brought out food in a timely manner. He was so polite and fun to talk with.< /text>

The pizza does NOT serve three people. It's about the same size as a single CPK pizza. Considering the quantity of food with the other options, the pizza is a very bad value. Similar homemade pizza costs maybe $4. (Fresh mozzarella is the most expensive ingredient but the pizza had very little of it.)< /Text>

Overpriced for Italian food. Food came out plates extremely hot food was warm. Got charged extra for sauce. They need to learn how to make garlic bread. You just don't toast bread and dump garlic oil on it. Olive garden has better flavor...</text>

Went to Bucca Di Beppo with my family for their traditional Thanksgiving Dinner. Dietary restrictions usually make Thanksgiving a real drag for me, but Josh took great care of us and tended to my particular Thanksgiving accommodations. The staff also guided us to the elevators to assist our elderly diners in getting upstairs, and gave my brother a special birthday surprise. MAGNIFICENT!</text>

Food was good, but it's pretty pricey. Also, definitely not a place want to go to by yourself. Portions are big, but expensive. I went with a friend and we had a hard time figuring out what to eat, since you kind of need to share since the portions are big, so you can't get much variety.</review>

Slow service. Waiter got our order wrong and rang it in when he realized he had put in the wrong order.
Didn’t refill our drinks.

Food is Definitely not worth the money.< /Text>

We planned to go there for a month and I was really looking forward to it since we come all the way from the high desert. Walking into the place we found an overwhelming stench and I'm not sure what it was but it had been a long drive so we went to the bathroom and found that the toilets look like they had not been cleaned in months and there was urine all over the floor. This was at 4:30 in the afternoon and the place was virtually empty of customers. Walking to our table  we passed a bunch of display bottles of wine that look like they hadn't been wiped of dust in at least a week or so  not to mention the fake dry  flowers that were so filthy they were completely discovered in really need to be thrown away years ago. Well they seated us and across from our table was a countertop with dirty used napkins and close to that was the bus clean up tray full of old food and dirty dishes and that was fairly disgusting.
I finally got fed up and just ask for the manager. I explained to him how far ahead we planned and how far we drove to hopefully have a good experience because we wanted something a little more flavorful then our local Olive Garden and I had him walk with me first to the bathroom and then to the counters and then looked at all the dirt and filth in all I could get out of this guy was pretty much just excuses about  "Well it was busy a while ago and that's why things were dirty" and I'm going well that kind of dirt doesn't happen in an hour it happens on a consistent basis and explained to him that that was the reason that we were leaving when he had asked if there was anything that he could do for us. We left and had an excellent dinner at the Macaroni Grill.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Everything is family style here. One small serving of pasta is what I would make for my family of 4 for dinner. My visit was for a party of 8. We got fried mozzarella, salad and breschetta pre-meal. Then a large pepperoni pizza, small fettuccine w/chicken on the side and spaghetti and meatballs. We had leftovers because it was alot of food. All of the food was awesome in taste! We left the restaurant so full and happy! They sang a unique Happy bday song to my lil' cousin. Very hospitable and attentive. We bought photo souvenirs of our visit. I would go again. But sit in a different area next time. They have so many options.<//Text>

<Text>Always love coming here! Great classic food, served family style. The torteloni is my ultimate favorite! Not a bad wait even on weekends with no reservations, like 30-45 minutes. Love the quirky, kitschy decore -always lots to look at and the Italian lessons playing over the speaker in the restrooms are too cute!< /Text><resp>None</resp>< name>

Ducked in the door to give the place a try for lunch. No host/hostess came to the front. I got tired of waiting and left. If you have to wait far too long to get seated, why gamble that they are going to be any faster on taking the order or getting your food?< /review>

I liked  Buca's in Minneapolis where it started. Then it went national and franchise and food quality now seems to have gone down. It might just be this location but it lost all  the charm I remember from the original restaurant. Guess that is the what happens when chasing  profits.< /Text>

Horrible food... My kids and I are all feeling horrible from eating there last night. Great servers but the food has gone to scrap, especially for the price!<//review>

<Review>Their spaghetti ( w/ plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepperoncini) is my favorite dish here. It's no frills but its simple, fresh, and tasty. Since i'm a growing boy and need my protein, I always order the Roasted Mary's Chicken which comes with king trumpet mushrooms and olive oil mashed potatoes. The chicken is always so moist and the mashed potatoes are bomb. Also don't forget to order the Tartine bread to start! Reservations are a must! It's always packed in here.<//Review>< user_name>

I thought the food was pretty good. We were in a large group so the "family style" entrees worked rather well. The interior of the restaurant is odd ad there seemed to be many photos of large women and the Pope.< /Review>

We visited this restaurant with a mixed group, four adults and young two children. The service was great, servers were very friendly and accommodating to every member of my family. For a large place the noise volume was good. Because of our mixed group, we ordered a simple meal, spaghetti and meatballs and an order of baked ziti. The meal was fine, but I would not order it again. The colossal brownie sundae was very tasty and hit the spot; oh, the coffee is good as well. My wife and I will come back and try something different rather than the same old pasta dishes, maybe the salmon sorrento or the chicken saltimbocca. I was thinking about this. Why go to an Italian restaurant and order something you can make yourself that is great? Try something new.< /text>

Didn't have candles for a cake we brought in. Then decided to charge 15$ cake fee for bringing our own cake. Food was mediocre at best. The only good things was the brussel sprouts but even that lacked flavor. Had 7 people ordered 3 large entrees and salad and veggies side total came out to 280$ for horrible food. Will not go back. Only reason we went bc we got a gift card for xmas and it was my bf birthday.<//Review>

I have never dined in but we order pick up every other week. Staff is always super friendly, food is ready on time and very hot, and they give you a large piece of bread for each person that will br eating what you ordered! Also, coupons are emailed monthly.</review>

< Review>
So apparently there's no Buca di Beppo in south orange county anymore? That's a shame.. but I'm assuming it's because of the way their resturant is designed.  For a couple, you end up spending way too much money on two small entrees to share. On top of this, a lot of people hate sharing food so I understand why it wouldn't work out.

They need to work on establishing a happy hour, and taking mobile coupons because no one prints coupons anymore and I've been turned away from them because I had a mobile coupon.</Review>

Hit or miss with this place. Sometimes hostess would forget house bread, so you have to stay on top and ask. Other then that, food is great, staff is friendly, and resturaunt is clean.</text>

We believed we had a good experience until I check my bank statement and they stole from us $30. We left the waitress a cash tip of 15%. It must of not been enough that she chose to steal from us by altering the bill. The bill says it was 10 people and even that is altered , it was 5 adults and a child. We can't even trust an establishment like Bucca because they hired a thief . We are calling corporate and the location we went to. I will not hesitate to file a police report. I have a posted picture on yelp of her name on the receipt .<//Review>< Pics>

3 we’re tasty. Prices are higher but you get more food and if you sign up for buca club you can get discounts of your bill. Will be back for more Buca di Beppo for sure.< /review>< Pictures>

This time the waitress was over attentive, I think they were short on plates, they kept coming by and taking our plates, apologized for our food taking so long tickets got mixed up.

<text>My husband, daughter and I had a birthday dinner here. Very family friendly restaurant with quirky kitchi decor. Portions are enormous and meant to be shared. We had the manicotti which kept the sauce off to the side. Loved that! We also had fried shrimp parmesan-my only complaint is I found this dish to be heavy and didn't seem fresh- hence the ding in the stars. Very fun/casual atmosphere definitely go for the pasta dishes and bring friends!< /text>< user>

Every time we eat at this place over the years  my family has enjoyed  their food , however they could use a larger selection of tap beers but the food is always wonderful and plenty of it family style if you have friends or family in town and you want to impress them bring them here.</Text>

Since the parking is shared with a fitness center so may park a little away.  Food was alright.  A bit expensive but join the email club will get some coupon.  I got this giant chocolate brownie for birthday which received the coupon from email.</text>

FOOD POISONING!!!!!!
DO NOT EAT HERE!

I ordered through postmates and my food was under cooked and expired like the chef was too lazy to cook a new batch. Spent 3 hours throwing up everything and I was throwing up whole food. I complained to post mates and all they would do is give me a $10 credit. RIDICULOUS! Buca di Beppo I want a refund of my $30 meal.<//Text>

Can't go wrong with Buca di Beppo for hearty Italian food and a fun environment. The only issue with this location is that convenient parking can be a little short, but everything else is nice.< /text>

So one is required to use a parking structure that is about 400 meters away. About a quarter of a mile, US.

I know this is a chain and once up a time they had decent food. I am DONE with chains.

They prepare the food in their warehouse kitchen and transport the food to their various locations. Upon arrival the resturants heat the food to the desired temperature. I feel like I am paying  to eat frozen.

Our lasagne was icy cold in the middle and the pasta was sogging. The salads were wilted  and smell. Our party of 15 +,  was polite about the food most carried it home and threw it out.

The manager was rude; he told us to leave because we were there to long. Now, we  were in the middle of ordering  after dinner drinks and desserts.  No, our group was disruptive or loud. We even  put out the fire on the table next to us.

May 19, 2018, was a celebration of my neice's birthday and celebrating her graduation from college.</Text>

We had to ask for house bread and they didn't give us the vinegar and oil. We had to ask for that too. The spicy rigatoni was inconsistent with how it was made the last time we went. It was not as spicy. The markups on the pasta are roughly 900%.</text>

Each plate is $30 or more bring money or bring a ton of people they serve enormous amount of food.  And you get a nifty picture to take home.< /Review>

<text>We arrived Monday around 5:30 pm. Got seated in bar area because I had injury and couldn't climb stairs. Our order was taken: salad and chicken saltembaca. The salad came quickly. Took awhile for bread. Then the wait began for our entry. It got busy. Some couples came in. Were served and left. We're looking at 6:10 pm. At 6: 15 I ask a waitperson to check on our order. It will be out soon. The bar tender who is doubling as our waiter comes over and tells us it will be out soon. Wait. At 6: 30 pm I tell him just make it to go. "Ok. We wait. Finally at 7pm he brings by our Togo order. I place our left over salad, pay and go. I get home and he gave us the wrong order! Instead of saltembaca we get Penne Reno, a pasta dish, also cheaper than the saltembaca. I tasted it and it wasn't very good. Some of the peas weredried out.
We've been there in the past and had a good experience and food. Not yesterday. Very dissatisfied. I should have checked order before we left but was tired and aggravated and wanted to leave. So beware.

Big serving, not much taste nor seafood. Among other items on the menu we ordered a large linguini frutta de mare.  It's  supposed to serve 5.  What we got was a ton of linguini and not much frutta de mare.  The seafood that went with the ton of linguini was only good for 1.5 servings at most.</Review>

At one time this was (Buca in general not just this location) one of my favorite places to have Italian.  Over the last ten years or so what you get has decreased while their prices have increased.  My last trip there (the HB location), service was slow, the food was O.K., prices pretty high for the quality (well over $100  for 3, my surprise the house red was $10 a glass) and the parking just sucks.  Well, there are other places that are expensive and better.</Review>

<Review>Worst experience for my first time. The a.c. was not working it was really hot. 2nd Julio our waiter was not attending us he paid better attention to the people in front of us was  rude e didn't check on us. I was thirsty and I had to wave down another waiter. But I think her name was Ariana who came over to ask how things where. I was discounted on part of my bill. I will only like to thank her personally.< /Review>< pics>

We were treated to a dinner here last week and it is just lousy. I remembered why I hate Buca di Beppos.

First we ate in the Pope Room, as a Catholic I can say it is kinda weird... I mean I can appreciate all of it. But since I am guessing most people are not Catholic dedicating a room to the Pope is odd. In fact we were among the last to arrive in the party and the poor protestants we were supping with had already had the bust of Pope John Paul II removed from the room. I have seen it before, and having the Pope's head in the middle of a lazy Susan is kind of creepy.

We were a large party, but that doesn't excuse the slow service, it is not like we didn't have reservations. Or that since there is a room constantly booked for large parties, they should be properly staffed for it. Especially if when it gets close to the time for the next party they are rushing you out. Come on, if it didn't take forever to bring the order we'd be gone naturally.

Food was poor to mediocre at best. The selections were Spaghetti and demolished meatball pieces, Chicken Parmesan and Pasta Alfredo. The Alfredo was simply inedible, how can you go wrong with pouring a box of Spaghetti into boiling water and the Chicken was actually edible. There was also a salad and horrible cheesecake type something. It didn't taste like any cheesecake I have ever had. There was no crust, and tasted like it was missing salt and other ingredients that bring out the flavor. Maybe it was some kind of healthy, sugar free, salt free, gluten free dessert substitute.

So I was seated near the host so I saw the bill, so for 3 bowls of salad, 3 bowls of each of the 3 entrees, and 18 slices of wannabe cheesecake it was $568 including tax and tip with soft drinks for some of the people.  No alcohol that I saw was served. That's more than $31 per person!!! Sorry I would've come a little unglued if I were paying for that... For $50 I could go to Costco and buy a lot more and better frozen Italian food that could be thrown in the oven and taste 100x better. Even pick up a $6 box of garlic bread with 27 slices. Yeah I would have to work a little to cook it, but for $500 it would be worth it.

Parking was awful, we circled twice and were late to the dinner, so we just parked in the "to go"  spot, nobody said anything.

One last humorous event, before the kicked us out, someone stopped by with a digital camera and had everyone bunch up on the far side of the dirty table and took a picture. Then came back with 4 pictures with a Buca di Beppo's border around them and said we could buy the pictures (which are going in the trash if we didn't anyway) for $10 each. Really??? We took pictures at the event ourselves and for a couple dollars I could print everyone at the table 8x10 photos if they wanted.<//review>

We were treated to a dinner here last week and it is just lousy. I remembered why I hate Buca di Beppos.

First we ate in the Pope Room, as a Catholic I can say it is kinda weird... I mean I can appreciate all of it. But since I am guessing most people are not Catholic dedicating a room to the Pope is odd. In fact we were among the last to arrive in the party and the poor protestants we were supping with had already had the bust of Pope John Paul II removed from the room. I have seen it before, and having the Pope's head in the middle of a lazy Susan is kind of creepy.

We were a large party, but that doesn't excuse the slow service, it is not like we didn't have reservations. Or that since there is a room constantly booked for large parties, they should be properly staffed for it. Especially if when it gets close to the time for the next party they are rushing you out. Come on, if it didn't take forever to bring the order we'd be gone naturally.

Food was poor to mediocre at best. The selections were Spaghetti and demolished meatball pieces, Chicken Parmesan and Pasta Alfredo. The Alfredo was simply inedible, how can you go wrong with pouring a box of Spaghetti into boiling water and the Chicken was actually edible. There was also a salad and horrible cheesecake type something. It didn't taste like any cheesecake I have ever had. There was no crust, and tasted like it was missing salt and other ingredients that bring out the flavor. Maybe it was some kind of healthy, sugar free, salt free, gluten free dessert substitute.

So I was seated near the host so I saw the bill, so for 3 bowls of salad, 3 bowls of each of the 3 entrees, and 18 slices of wannabe cheesecake it was $568 including tax and tip with soft drinks for some of the people.  No alcohol that I saw was served. That's more than $31 per person!!! Sorry I would've come a little unglued if I were paying for that...

Just left here after two entrees being over cooked and tasteless.  Our service was mediocre at best, left with empty drinks and lack if caring. No one from management came over to apologize for poor quality food, a true disappointment.< /Text>
