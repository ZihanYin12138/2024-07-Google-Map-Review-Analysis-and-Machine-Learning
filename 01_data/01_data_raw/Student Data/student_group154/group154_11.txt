This was the third or forth time that I use their services and not once was I disappointed. I've been assisted by two different drivers but each of them have always been professional and very respectful and not once have they made us feel uncomfortable in any way. I appreciate how well they handled each situation and overall made it a fast process on every occasion that I had an emergency.</review>

I called in advance for the following day needing a tow to a local shop, Gilbert from Smitty's Tow showed up on time and helped me out. It was raining and he took extra car of my car strapping the wheels done & taking the time to make sure it was properly secure. It was raining so making sure its properly secure made my day knowing my vehicle is safe during transport. If you need a Tow make sure and call Smitty's and ask for Gilbert<//text>

It was supposed to be 90 minutes until the driver got there. Nick was there in less than 60 minutes and the car was at the shop 20 minutes later. Great job! Nick is the best!<//text>

< review>
Outrageous fees and insensitive owners.
After returning from Thanksgiving in Texas (95 year old mother-in-law and 98 year old father-in-law), my RV was towed while I was out of town.
Yes, got caught in the 72 hour "move-it" ordinance.
Luckily the Lompoc Police Dept. waived the $175 fine (thanks Sgt. Magana!), but this company is demanding $1200 as of Dec. 2, 2019 and adding $125/day!! No compromise.
Even after the PD waived the fine!!!
I offered to pay $300-$400 this morning, but Kimberly said no, that "We're in the business of towing, and no negotiation". Unbelievable.
They should be ashamed of their unwillingness to work with me on this.
I will not let this go, and will see them in Court.</review>

<review>Smitty towing is awesome! Super professional and prompt. I got my truck stuck in the sand and they sent someone out in 15 minutes. My truck was well taken care of, and towed out of the sand quickly and efficiently. I 10000% recommend this company! Great job guys!</review>< pics>

Smitty's was awesome. I called for help via AAA, and got a call from a tow truck driver almost as soon as I put in my request. My car is nonstandard and the driver was prepared and equipped for it, no problem. Had me on my way in 20 minutes flat.< /review>

You would think people would learn to keep their hands off of people.

Today started out with me attempting to get them to reason with them. At the end of the day, my mother in law, is recording the Manager and the other employees as they release her vehicle from the impound lot. During the time she was recording he hits the camera. You can see it at 00:49.</review>

<text>This is the worst company to have unlock your door Jeremy is an excellent person to unlock your doors take some seconds no harm to the car as for Victor it takes him five minutes to get in the car and be careful check your windows because that he broke my window and they don’t want to claim to fix it they also will have you call AAA and try to get charge them some more money so they can get paid again PS after they tell you you need to get your car checked out by Perry’s I’d suggest a different place to get a check by because that’s both ways that they can get money but sending you to somebody they have fixed your car does say that it wasn’t their fault and charge you up the butt So beware</text>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The closing was so easy. The notary met us at my office, and we just sat and signed all the documents. There were a few days between the closing and the payoff date, which resulted in us receiving a past due notice on the old loan- but I called Carrington and they verified that it was all settled. Other than that, it was an easy refinance.< /Text>< pics>

Food was really delicious. We ordered a chicken Katsu curry and a loco Moco.
Only reason I am giving 4 star because service was ok. Two server was there but they were constantly talking to each other and we need to ask a question about the food while we are eating because it’s not described on the menu what kind of meat on the curry sauce?? I waited few minutes raised my hand 🤚 no attention at all so I had to call them loudly “excuse me” then they came.
Definitely will go again because of the food. They have a big parking lot as well<//Text>

< Review>
I ordered a pretty ordinary breakfast plate of eggs and portuguese sausage, so you can't go wrong with that. However, I liked that I had the choice of spiced hawaiian bread! 😁 The potato mac salad was delicious! And it may be very well one of the best I've tried so far. Would definitely go back for that and to try other things. The place is pretty outdated, but the service was great! I forgot to take pics of the place and I give the bathroom 2 stars just because it's dated.< /Review>

<Text>There's hardly any parking because of the Korean restaurant next door patrons taking all the parking.  The food and service at Ladybug are good, very inexpensive and worth the try!   It:s not really Japanese but it's more like local Hawaii mix.  I personally recommend you try this place!<//Text><user>113890953329678483967< /user><response>None</response></record>

In the city to visit a customer and in the mood for Asian food. We decided for this place, looks like a little hole in the wall but is bigger inside than it looks. Caution there are several Asian type restaurants in this small shopping center... lol Food was delicious and service was great. Went during the lunch hour so very busy first sign of a good place. Seen 1 girl serving and the rest cooking and charging... she was fantastic loved her happy self and  service she gave us. Highly recommend 👍☺</Review>

<text>I’ve been here about 2-4 times and this will be my last since they changed some of the staff and it wasn’t great service and not much welcoming, and worse of all the chicken was undercooked. The other times I came were much better. They need to step it up !<//text>< pictures>

Quality has really gone down ever since they moved into that new building. Such a shame...Oh and the prices went up too. No thanks! I don’t mind paying for quality, but this, no LOL

Exceptional service and food. I come in, get seated right away and have my order taken quickly. After about 5 minutes my spam roll and chicken bowl were both ready. Wow! Plus, the food was super delicious and really filling, but not leaving you feeling heavy where you kind of have shortness of breath from a big meal LOL. Nonetheless, I recommend you give them try. You have nothing to lose and if you don’t like them don’t expect to feel that you’ve lost your hard earned cash. I paid only $8 bucks for my meal. That’s super affordable. Give them try! I recommend the lady bug fried chicken bowl and the spam Mitsubi.<//text>

<Text>This place has the absolute best sushi I have ever had! It is a bit small though so big parties aren't ideal but if you bring a couple friends, you'll get seated pretty quickly. They usually don't take long to make your food  and the waitstaff is very pleasant. Make sure to tip!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I love this place. Was recommended to eat here from one of my employees.  Now I order here at least once a week. The Japanese curry is delicious. Full of flavor and the amount of food is filling. The chicken Katsu is delicious as well.<//Review>

Great prices. Good food. Parking lot is kind of tough though because of the billiards next door. Look for street parking. It's the plaza next to the dealership.</review>

It was alright me and my cousin had a good meal. The service was fantastic the staff was nice its just that the food i ordered isnt what i expected it to taste like. I ordered a chicken teriyaki and kalbi, the kalbi is good the problem was the teriyaki im pretty sure it wasnt fresh because it was cold and soggy it wasnt pleasant. I wouldve given them 5 stars.. but yeah the teriyaki< /Text>

Love Lady Bug's! They actually catered my wedding a few years ago. Great Japanese-Hawaiian plate lunch food. Their chicken katsu plate lunch is my favorite. For around $7.50 (in 2016, at least), you can get a hearty plate of chicken katsu, white rice, green salad, and mac salad. They also have great kalbi, chicken teriyaki, sushi, and other yummy dishes.

This is a must if you're ever craving good Japanese American/Hawaiian food!<//Review>

I’m really impressed with the customer service. I got a stereo installed an amplifier and speakers in my 2005 Chevy avalanche and I’m very happy with the quality of work in the customer service. The guys and the technicians are really helpful and really down to earth people. Good experience..... 100%< /text>

I went there hoping to buy a CD player disc cleaner.  But the man was on the phone then went in the back.  I heard still on the phone.  Then it was really quiet.  I still waited a few minutes.  He never came back so I left.  I won't be buying a car stereo from that place.  EVER.</text>

Got my stereo done here for the first time && I absolutely loved the outstanding customer service the owner is extremely helpful and tries to get you the best price out the door to keep you comming back, I ended up telling my husband about this place so he got his car done too bc it was super outdated and Nagis Electronics didn't disappoint he did an amazing  job with my husband's car too !! Definitely come here to get your stereo fix they will not disappoint you :)<//Text>

<text>Went to the big box (BB) and they said could not be done after keeping my truck all day , wanted a pop out monitor on a new stereo and back up camera on my Dodge Dakota truck.  Nagi showed me how he would do it and quoted me a fair price (better than the guys who could not do it).  Took it in and what a job they worked all day to make this thing a custom fit and its beautiful.  Very knowledgeable  and both Nagi and Dirt busted their hump to get this thing done and DONE RIGHT..  highly recommend my new friends at Nagi's Electronics stop by and tell them Bob said hi........<//text><userid>108737672543533098588</userid><time>1553520728817< /time><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<text>Called for a quote, got a great price and an appointment scheduled, no problems. Showed up and they installed a very nice and affordable stereo in my daughters car.

Nagis delivers on what they promise without a lot of high pressure nonsense.

Highly recommended.< /text>< pictures>

I've been doing my own stereo work for quite some time... it's hard to find someone that knows what they are doing,and takes pride in their work... I have no second thoughts about bringing my cars or trucks to Nagi's, Dustin is knowledgeable and does an excellent job, and Nagi is knowledgeable, and makes sure the customers get quality equipment and work...  and the prices are comparable to other stereo shops... only difference is here I leave satisfied and stay satisfied...< /Review>

Horrible place. Ashes left in my trunk from guy smoking while installing my sub. They grounded my stuff wrong and they couldnt even get it to work. I ended up leaving and unhooking everything myself. Waste of money and time.</review>

Came in to get a stereo installed. He talked me into buying another amp from him and everything. I went to Best Buy and bought the deck because he didn't have it. He said he had everything but the deck. Once the installer started drilling on my car, he tells me he doesn't have the dash kit. I could have bought it at Best Buy when I went and bought my own deck. Place looks like everything was bought ten years ago anyway. I don't recommend even trying here!</Text>

Your better off spending your money somewhere els where they know what there doing because when i went there the, Mechanic forgot to install the base control, they were fighting with one another also Didnt know my Amp Remained on for 2 days and drained my battery i had to get a jump start that morning. When i called to tell them what they did wrong the person who was on the kept blaming me that the Amp Kit i got was Broken " which i wasn't because i just bought it a day before" well he continued to yell at me and wouldn't give him manager.
So i lost a 100$ and have to buy a new Battery.. Definitely wouldnt go there, youre best going to best buy and having a professional do it.</Review><UserId.>107178364777592240985< /UserId.><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

The 6 CD changer in the center dash of my 2003 G35 quit working. Then the climate and stereo controls also in the center dash stopped working at times. Nagi's Auto Sounds replaced the center dash with a dash kit that looked identical to the old one except it had a place for a new Pioneer2700SB AM,FM,CD,DVD, MP3 player. They also added a backup camera. It was installed as promised in 3 hrs and for less than a competitor quoted. Great Job guys!</review>

I had gotten 2 12" subwoofers for Christmas and they had been working great for a while but they had stopped working. When i had brought them back they replaced it due to the issues with no charge. I definately recommend this audio shop for anyone that wants a sound system for a great price and great sound!< /Review>

<Review>Today I went in So I can get a custom job done for my vehicle which is an Infiniti FX 35. What I wanted was to keep my Stock Screen that came with my Car so I can keep my navigation system and to keep control of my air conditioner and more. I got good advice on where that screen could go on this custom built and so I decided to remove the cupholder section and replace it with the stock screen and where the screen used to be the new Double din pioneer 2800 BS was installed. The end result turned out amazing I love it just how I pictured it I would highly recommend this place to anyone. My overall experience was great.. I'm talking about great customer service , hard-working and well knowledge people working here. After the job was done I went home satisfied but I had one thing in mind I decided to contact other audio places nearby and the prices were ridiculous and I contacted a well-known audio place called Meece and what they told me was they can't do that work because they only do More Simple work. I'm not here trying to throw shade at Meece audio shop but let me tell you Nagi's Shop is the place to go. Anyways I really highly recommend this place</Review>< pics>

< Review>
I bought a 1990 Acura Integra with no stereo or speakers installed, I looked around for the best prices in the antelope valley area and found Nagi's Auto Sounds had the best deals, plus they installed everything for me the same day. I already had a sub woofer I wanted to use, so they sold me the box for it and installed everything for me. I love to bump around town now and I get allot of complements on the system. They treated me with great customer service and they gave me 6 month warranty on all my stuff! Thanks again Nagi!< /Review>

Nagi was very helpful figuring out my audio sound needs!  They are amazing!!!  They have amazing prices!  Nagi's Autosound helps his community, too!!  He held a great carwash fundraiser for the KHS Marching Band in March 2014.< /review>

that what they say about our shop
Anyone can sell and instal car audio but at what price and how skilled are the installers? The big test comes when something doesn't work right? I went to Nagi's after another place tried to charge me an extra $40 because "The one I ordered was no longer available and the price of the replacement was higher." Nagi, got me the replacement at what I was originally going to pay. The install was totally professional. There was a problem with AM on the radio that turned out to be a problem with my car not the equipment nor install. The fact that it was my car at fault didn't stop Nagi from working with me and getting it fixed when, I am sure, other dealers would have told me it was problem and left it there. Your 100% satisfaction is important to Nagi and I highly recommend Nagi¿s and will use him again when I get a new car.<//Review>

<Text>I bought Kenwood DNX9990hd for 2010 F150 Lariat with sony system in it. I went through hell trying to get this system to work. I went to 4 different places in Palmdale and Lancaster, Every person I talked to said this system could not have satellite radio because of the sync. Nagis owner said he will figure it out and order the part for me. The owner found the part within an hour and gave me a great deal on the part and the installation. I got to keep my Sync, wheel control, all my wires are under the center console, keep the satellite radio, HD radio and Nav system all working. They did a fantastic job. I would highly recommend this place.<//Text>< response>

Worse place in the a.v. nagi is the worse !!! He buys stereos from l.a. lower than 100 bucks and tries to charge you almost 200. Worse customer service ever.</Text>

If you have a newer car take your car elsewhere.  The owner knows nothing about wiring of new cars . Very slow service and try to force you to into buying there overpriced car audio.< /review>

<Text>This was one of my favorite restaurants ever - and now it is SHUT. The location was simply incredible, with a very laid-back atmosphere. Food was always excellent, and service friendly. Today, February 20, 2018, one of the last mom and pop 'surf shack' cafes was LOST FOREVER due to lease renewal greed for the location by the City of Seal Beach. An iconic place is now gone. The City of Seal Beach has no idea how upset they have made both regular locals and visitors from outside of the country like me by outing this place. Apparently many regulars were in tears to learn of River's End being shut.
Until I was talking with the owners while they were removing all of the fittings from the restaurant today, I had no idea they were even looking after the cleaning and supplies for the public beach restrooms in the adjacent building, in addition to their own restrooms.
To all involved with River's End: thanks for a great 20 years... people really appreciated what you were doing.
Losing River's End is a HUGE LOSS for both Seal Beach and California.
Greed knows no bounds.<//Text>< pictures>

I was there end of November 2020. It was boarded up and weeds were growing. Looks like it was closed for quite some time.< /text>

<review>Solid food. Busy on weekends obviously. Ample seating inside and outside. A good place for brunch and has excellent views of the ocean. Very relaxed. Make sure to pay for your parking outside at one of machine around the corner of the restaurant as you come in from the parking lot.</review>< pics>

<text>Located at the end of the San Gabriel River bike route, River's End Cafe is a wonderfully informal, delicious place to treat ourselves before heading home. Although they have delicious-looking lunch choices, I have only ordered breakfast, as have my fellow riders. I can say the eggs Benedict, chilaquiles, and omelettes are great, as is the service. And could the ambiance be any better--right on the beach? I highly recommend River's End for casual dining.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Good food, one the beach, mostly outdoor eating, dog friendly and a nice staff.  Can be a bit crowed on weekends between 10 and 1.

Sorry to say, now closed.  Looks like another restaurant may move in but not yet. ;-(</review>< time>

But this is a great local spot that lets us get the beach resort treatment during the daily grind. Didn't realize it was going to be so cold out there? That's ok, they have blankets you can borrow while dining! They've thought of everything.< /Review>< pics>

The worst customer service I have ever seen. We stood in line for 25 minutes (along with 4 or 5 other parties) while they seated one person. There were at least 10 empty tables. When we inquired, we were rudely told they were not seating because the kitchen was overwhelmed. Not sure how this business got any decent reviews when customers are treated like that.
We did not even get a chance to try the food.<//Review>

I have never actually been inside of this place ---- but i am reviewing it as i view it from the outside almost every week... looks very nice, people enjoy dining and drinking --- everyone seems happy ----- right on the sand, cant beat the location.. bike riders like to take a rest and head back on the trail--- probably a nice place to take a date---</Review>

Seriously low key one of my favorite restaurants. They are dog friendly, allow you to bring dogs onto the outside patio.
You can ride your bike here from the river bike path, park your bike and eat.
Great food, ok prices, awesome service, location couldn’t be better.< /review>

Great location, meh execution.  Food was ok but nothing better than what could be whipped up at home with standard supermarket groceries.  Place was was understaffed and had run out of some menu items.  The location though is excellent with gorgeous views.  Loved watching the sunset from the deck.  If this place upgraded their menu and management, could be the best spot in Seal Beach.<//review>

Me and my brother rode form the Santa Fe Dam to Seal Beach, and one of the places I wanted to hit was the River's End Cafe. I thought it was so neat to be sitting on the patio, having lunch right on the beach!

That said, the food was ok. It's essentially bar food, so greasy and tasty. Their prices are high. Their service is very slow.

If you don't mind dropping 10 bucks for burgers and fries and aren't in a hurry, it's a nice place.< /Review>

The location is great, you can see right onto the beach from almost anywhere in the resturant. The decor really says "Beach Town," so anyone visiting our little town can really get the idea. The food was good (once it arrived) but there aren't very many vegetarian options. Over all, I would call it a 7 out of ten.<//Text>

I went to this place years ago for breakfast. Although the location is beautiful, the service was terrible (slow). Sitting on the patio, I had to go in to make sure they knew someone was out there. After ordering the eggs benedict and waiting too long again, it was terrible! The server never came back out to check so I had to go inside again to request to send it back. I next ordered the breakfast combo of eggs, bacon & toast, but when the bill came was charged for both!! Also, my husband wanted to wash his hands before eating & was told they don't have a restroom in the restaurant. He had to go to the public restroom on the beach which was filthy! Gave 1 star for location only.<//review>

Too bad you have to give a star at all.  Food was okay; however, even being forewarned about the poor service, it was very disappointing.  One would think with all the negative comments posted about the lack of service, the owners would take some action.  The location drives the business and this seems to satisfy ownership.  The mandatory three dollar parking fee is not a plus.
Go to Main Street and have a much more pleasant experience.<//text>

The only reason I keep coming here is the location, I like to get my exercise by bicycling along the San Gabriel river and my sister just so happens to live a mile away, so after I bike 24 miles this is a convenient spot to meet my sister for breakfast or lunch.

The service is atrocious - slow no matter how many servers or how many patrons, the food is just passable - how they can mess up making an egg or making a sandwich is beyond me.  Apathetic,  lazy, uninterested in doing their job but boy they are right on top of noticing that the bill is ready to be paid.  If they were only this good at noticing that my drink is in need of being refilled I could leave a better tip.<//Review>

Always have to wait for seating even when there are seats available they do not take care of their loyal customers. Insults you if you complain about the food over priced I do not recommend it is sad this use to be a good ace to go but the manager got complacent and feels now he can treat the locals poorly</review>

<Review>A very casual Beach Shack Diner thAt sits directly on the San Gabriel River as it meets the Pacific Ocean in Seal Beach. The river divides the Cities of Long Beach & Seal Beach. The property was resurrected 5 years ago from abandonment. It was a. Boarded up building with weed growing in cracked asphalt & concrete sidewalks. Now is is a tropical Beach Patio connecting the popular bike trails with a million dollar view of the beach and ocean beyond. I had breakfast & mimosas here many times with favorite routes such as omelettes, pancakes ( Apple, banana or blueberry  ) grits, poached eggs benedict, pastrami scramble,  sirloin chili scramble, steak and eggs, more<//Review><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Location is good.  But they really should fix this place up a little.  It has a lot of potential.  The food I've tried here so far is"ok".  Service can be hit and miss.  Sucks that you have to pay for parking since it's actually on the beach.</review>

We went for lunch, love the venue on the beach.  The food is awful my guy ordered a Patty Melt with fries, the bread was tough, the patty was overcooked, the fries just OK.  I ordered a Turkey Burger with coleslaw, the coleslaw is delightful all 3 tablespoonsful.  The turkey, touted to have 11 spices and seasonings was nearly tasteless, now that could be because the patty was seared to overdone on the outside with just a little pink inside.  And if either item, patty melt or turkey burger, was a 1/2 pound patty as advertised on the menu I will actually go back and eat again, otherwise NEVER!< /Review>

Where the San Gabriel River meets the ocean is a nice little dinner that serves a good breakfast. Most of the seating is outside, so if it is cold or windy it is not optimal.<//Review>

Do not go here!
This use to be a staple for our family, and would enjoy brunch mimosas and revel in the view with friendly service!
We came here for Father's Day, knowing full well it would be busy, placing our names on a list and waited patiently for a four person table.
We came in at ten thirty, and after an hour of viewing several tables open with no one being called to be seated, the tables just sitting open, we were getting very antsy and annoyed.
They wouldn't even let us sit at a vacant table and just order a drink!
A couple walked in at around twelve (still not seated, and no names having been called!), put there name at the bottom of the list, and once they were done, a worker from the back came forward immediately hugged the man and ushered him inside to be seated, saying 'I got you bro!'.
We immediately asked to speak to a manager, and we're told that we wouldn't be allowed to speak to a manager, he was busy.
The workers began to laugh and chat in Spanish, unaware that my entire family speaks Spanish as they bad mouthed us, thinking it was hilarious to call us names! Just because a person appears to be a different culture than you doesn't mean we don't speak the same language idiots!
This is fathers days mind you, so we were really trying not to get to upset, or upset our father who thankfully didn't hear them!
A young kid came out and announced that the kitchen was backed up and no one else would be seated for an hour, when no one had been seated for over two hours!
We'd already waited and knew we wouldn't be able to go anywhere else in time, so had to wait if we wanted to eat before my family left back home!
We were seated at 1:20pm, and were told we had to order right away cause kitchen was closing at two, and they had no bacon or sausage either. (What brunch place runs out of these breakfast staples??)
Worst worst worst!
This place is trash, and needs new management right away!
I will never go here as long as the present owner has possession of this restaurant and I will make sure all of my friends and family know to never patron such a rude and disgusting place!< /Text>

<Text>Service is terrible.  The alleged owner is belligerent.  We talked to Seal Beach Police about his vulgar vocabulary and aggressive behavior towards my husband and were informed that there was nothing they could do as he did not physically assault my husband.  The rub was over the fact that  my husband was using the public restroom to rinse the sand off his feet, mind you not in the sink but over the drain in the floor of the restroom.  It took everything in my husband to remain calm, polite and apologize.  The owner then proceeded to refuse service to us.  We used to eat there regularly when on bicycle rides along with our cycling friends.  We will NEVER eat there again nor will we recommend the place.  SB Police informed us that the restrooms are public and that the owner over stepped his boundaries but that there was noting they could do about his VERBAL ABUSE. SBPD claimed they would go talk to him but they would not even take a police report.  The officer admits knowing the owner and says that seemed very out of character for him.  I doubt this.  I think SBPD and SB community is very aware of this man's temper and it surprises me that River's End stays open given the poor customer service and so, so food.<//Text>< Pictures>

Sign says closed at 9pm. Arrived at 7:50pm, still closed early. Workers made excuses about closing at 9pm, I asked so when do you close, he mumbled 8:30. So why are you closed, people are still dinning.  SHAME. The managers probably gone.< /Review>

The owner needs a lesson in public relations and courtesy. Before asking for a table I chose to use the restroom but when I came out they were rude by the way they told me the restrooms were for paying customers only. I refused to have a seat. The owner told me to get out and didn't care if I had eaten there before. Well there are plenty other places to eat on the beach so I'll never go back. A fruit platter, a scoop of cottage cheese with ice tea for over 10 dollars. Give me a break...then they expect a tip!!!</review>

Wow. Had a situation with the owner which is a long story . But that man is the most disrespectful person I have ever encountered.  He threatened me to fight he said he was an officer and even through our wine in the bushes. He even asked us where we're from
Does that really matter. I have been eating at his restaurant for years with friends and family. But now I'm reaching out on social media to let everyone know what an ass this owner is<//text>

Poor service and a really rude staff.  The food is ok, I guess.  Other places in the area have the same if not better view.  Skip it.</review>

(Translated by Google) It is at the edge of the San Gabriel River Bikeway. It is about 10 miles from Cypress and the sunset is beautiful. Eating here is fun and happy.

I had high hopes for this place because it had such good reviews, boy was I wrong. Most of my order was bland( the garlic chicken was good) and my first bite of sesame chicken was mostly fat and bone. The rice wasn't cooked through and items labeled "hot and spicy" simply weren't and I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods.<//Text>

This place is excellent we just discovered it, my husband is vegan and there are many many vegan options.

Our favorite dishes are braised  tofu, chezwan broccoli,  string beans and the chow fun.

Also they give a discount of 10% to university students<//Review>

I ordered a number 3 chow main was the worst i have ever tasted just noodles no kind of veggies. The orange chicken was nasty nothing orange about it. All this food had no flavor taste like the pan was burnt. Am sorry but this place is not worth trying,i have been to many Chinese restaurants and never have had this quality of food. King Asian Cuisine is hands down a much better choice.< /Text>

<Text>Gross, gross, gross!   I went to eat there once and it was ok. Good food and nice service. So I took a leap of faith and went again, not such a great experience. There were live roaches on the table and wall. I actually believe one of them came from under my plate when she set the plate down and it started running on the table.Plus the fact it smells like Raid roach spray when you walk in solidifies my findings. I spoke to the server, and she acted like it was something normal. Never again will I step foot in that place.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x809143a796002bd5:0x52d6fb7f04ad51aa<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>China Caff is by far one of the best and affordable Chinese food restaurants in Merced. Customer Service is amazing. The people that work there are polite and welcoming. The food portions are hearty, so you will leave with leftovers (if you choose to keep your food). Plenty of options in combo plates to choose from. The appetizers are a bit pricey for an appetizer, but they are tasty. Customers have the option to dine in or take to go. Overall, great vibes all around.

PS: When ordering the Lemon Chicken, make sure to mention you want the chicken meat and not the chicken nuggets.< /Review>< Pictures>

Not bad. The entire restaurant is dated, so don't go for the decor.

Food is consistent. Service is okay.

I really liked the Hot and Sour soup.<//Text>

<Review>It's cheap for a reason...  my orange chicken and chowmein were very mushy and lacked flavor. My boyfriend's spicy beef had around 5 pieces of meat. And the appetizers cost almost as much as the combo meals? The cheap price isn't worth it in my opinion.</Review>< pictures>

I have multiple bad experiences with them. First they give me a old meat for the beef broccoli.Now today I have something stuck on my throat after I eat a beef broccoli from them.  I use to like them but now I don’t think I’m going back.<//text>

The service was up to par, food is always served with a warm, sincere smile, and it always arrives to my table not a moment too soon. Great family owned resaurant. Food always freshly made. Fresher than most other Chinese places like Panda. I enjoy coming here with friends, or just ordering for pickup when I'm in a mood to eat alone at home. I always recommend this place to friends who want to try different Chinese, straying away from big chain restaurants. I always tell them to at least try it. 9/10 it because their favorite place to get Chinese.</text>

< Review>
The food was just passable... I've had the orange chicken, sweet-n-sour pork, and sesame chicken, and the sweet-n-sour was putrid, I could not force myself to finish it. The sesame chicken tasted fine, but the flour still had a raw edge to it. The chicken chow mein is decent enough, although Im leaning more towards the egg fried rice.

The service was alright, and the prices are really the only redeeming aspect of this restaurant.</Review>

<review>Food was alright. Service was fast. The Asian  girl who took our order was very rude and rushed us as soon as we walked in the door. She came to our table 2 times and asked what we wanted and both times we said we needed more time. Then we got our food and every 5 minutes she would ask if everything is ok. I would like to eat my food in peace please.  Then before we were even done she brought the check and we had only been there for 20 minutes. Didn't ask if we wanted refill on water. Just stood behind the counter and kept staring and there was only 2 other people in the restaurant. Poor Customer service for rushing first time guests out of your establishment. Won't be returning to eat heRe to eat again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>1< /Rate><gmapID>0x809143a796002bd5:0x52d6fb7f04ad51aa<//gmapID><user_id>104830103004558104344<//user_id>< time>

<Text>Horrible! Since, when did chicken nuggets become  a Mandarin/Cantonese  food? Yes, chicken nuggets were on my plate. I ordered  lemon chicken, not chicken nuggets. Sweet and sour Pork was actually  sweet and sour CHICKEN! The egg fried rice  was drenched in soy sauce! Everything was cold! I was disgusted with this restaurant!!</Text>< pics>

Fried rice is just steamed rice fried with Soy sauce, no meats, veggies, egg nothing literally just rice with soy sauce. Garlic chicken is very good as well as the sweet and sour chicken. Chicken chow mein is so so, service was very friendly though.</text>

Beautiful office and very clean and staff is phenomenal. Dr Richter is caring and attentive to his patients needs and takes extra time making sure each patient is cared for and is an excellent chiropractor!! He has all types of equipment to help treat each individual patients needs as well
Our family has been with him since he began his practice and highly recommend him<//review>

First time visiting, staff is very friendly and welcoming. I was looking for an alternative to taking pain meds or cortisone shots. Definitely recommend Richter Family Chiropractic.<//text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Richter’s for a few years now. Greeted with a smile from each of the specialists and always with respect and courtesy. Always advancing with the practice using ongoing knowledge, you know you are treated well. The laser and spinal decompression have really been helpful with my life and their massage therapist really gets into your problem areas. She’s amazing! I have referred friends who have referred friends. If you need your spine adjusted or any of a myriad of conditions, tendinitis,  arthritis ... I wish you would go and talk with Dr. Richter.<//text>

<Text>Backstory:
I went to a different chiropractor for my back pain and he put me on this long drawn out plan that cost me nearly $1k, and he didnt relieve the back pain and i also walked away with HORRIBLE neck pain - my neck started to creek and crack when i would rotate it in any direction, cause several headaches a week, and would make it nearly impossible to work (i work at a desk to top it all off).  Sleeping was also a problem.

Just finished my 6th session with Dr. Richter and my neck finally isnt causing me DAILY pain. my neck pain would get so bad that it would literally bring me to tears (and id like to think im pretty tough!). The improvement is beyond significant. i wish i would have came to here in the first place but i was won over by the high volume of reviews from the other chiropractor. Dr. Richter stays super busy and i became really encouraged during my second visit when i over hear a patient talking about how they also had horrible issues and no other chiropractor was able to fix it, yet Dr. Richter was already relieving their pain.

There has been a couple times that he will adjust me, and ill walk to my car and i'll still feel something needs popped, and he never had a problem with re-seeing me to make sure he got everything he could.

Also! the way he does Xrays was different from the other chiropractor i had went to - Dr Richter took Xrays of my neck in different positions (so he can see the motion), and then he breaks it down and shows you which areas aren't moving properly .

HIGHLY recommend coming here! His experience shows and i am so grateful to finally have relief! Thank you so much for your dedication and for being so caring by not rushing in and out & really taking time to evaluate me before every single adjustment!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I have been going to Dr. Richter since June 2018. I found him on yelp. He and his staff are straightforward, honest and friendly. Since I have Kaiser many of his treatments are not covered by my insurance. However, he has many different payment plan options. I found the prices reasonable for the amount of treatment I need. After reviewing my X-rays and MRI he created a treatment and financial plan moving forward. He also explained in detail my issues and how treatment will set me on the road to recovery.</text></record></dataset><record>

I woke up one morning with severe neck pain that began to travel to my left shoulder. I tried everything to calm it, ice, meds, stretching. Nothing worked. The pain was so bad that I couldn't even sit to work on the computer. I finally got in to see Dr. Richter. I was first evaluated thoroughly and shown where my problem was, but also shown that the condition was a developing problem that could potentially become a permanent, unchangeable condition. Having extensive knowledge in anatomy, plus my own history of body abuse in life, I wasn't too surprised but yes, it is a shocking reality. Since starting treatments, not only do I feel a thousand times better, but I can turn my head much more than before and without pain!! Also, my chronic low back is feeling better since I decided to get treatment for that problem too. So, not only does the unique and on-point adjustments provided each time feel tailored for what ever I'm feeling, also the rest of the services provided, such as the massage roller table, the neck decompression, and the stimulation, help me feel amazing!! This is also all provided by a very kind, caring, and welcoming staff. I'm glad I found this place.<//Text>

<time>1519928765282< /time><rating>5</rating><review>Dr Richter is wonderful to deal with.  When the family first came in to talk with him,  he spent a  lot of time talking with us about our history,  and his plan for treatment.  X-ray' s were the first thing.  Not all chiropractors do them,  and I find it very important as to not "Go in blind". Chiropractic care is not inexpensive as most insurance companies don't cover much.  Regardless, he worked out a discounted family plan for the three of us,  which made it much more reasonable. All the staff is wonderful.  Greeted by multiple people EVERY time we go in. Can't say enough about this staff.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dcc7f88ea27bad:0x4e26945c59566846< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>Amazing, knowledgable and friendly chiropractor! I was on vacation visiting family in Corona and happened to experience very severe pain in my shoulder. I was able to get an immediate, same day appointment with Dr. Richter. Their staff and expertise made me feel so comfortable and Dr. Richter was able to do a full consult and exam to assess what was going on with my shoulder. This also included x-rays, which many chiropractors don't do where I'm from. He really went above and beyond to do what he could to help me while I was there and also helped connect me with a similar chiropractor right here at home in Maui. I am so thankful for Dr. Richter and their staff.<//Review><date>1531194411693<//date></record></dataset><record>

I came in after hardly being able to walk, Dr. Richter  worked on me, and I was able to walk pain free again, plus he gave me some stretches and exercises to do to make sure it would not happen again.   Richter Family Chiropractic is a professional, family friendly, health and recovery friendly environment!  I would encourage all to make it their home.</text>

Came here in hopes of getting rid of lower back pain and I can’t believe I’ve waited so long to come in. The treatment program has already improved my back and has allowed me to do things that my pain was preventing me from doing. Dr Richter and staff are very friendly and attentive making my every visit pleasant. I couldn’t imagine going anywhere else!</Review>

<username>Madelyn Kozich</username><review>If you're ever looking for a chiropractor, Dr. Richter's Family Practice is the place to be and the one to see. I was in so much pain when I came in...I couldn't even drive. With his help and  his extraordinary staff, I was out of pain in a snap! Now, I just enjoy coming back for my adjustments because I love the atmosphere too and how they take care of me. The staff is so 1 on 1 and personable here. They dont just ask  you how are you doing, they ask "how are YOU?". Everytime I go, I feel like I'm about to go see my friends.

<user_id>111209575027296897143< /user_id><Text>I’ve been going to Dr Richter for over 9years. He has always helped me greatly. 1st with migraines, then with a car accident, then with shoulder surgery and misalignment from teaching. Now, after my husband died in a car accident where a man on drugs hit our car at 75mph while I was pregnant, I am receiving help from Dr. Richter, after a year of physical therapy, because my spine and pelvis are still twisted and I still experience chronic pain from all my injuries and broken bones. My daughter is 2 years old now and Dr. Richter will be helping her as well with any trauma she may have sustained from the accident while in-utero. Dr. Richter is the only chiropractor I feel I can fully trust to help my body function more normally after such tragedy and trauma. Moreover, I fully trust him with my daughter as well. I also know that Dr.Richter’s expertise and knowledge have proven time and time again to help me greatly, as well as other people. Dr. Richter is one of the bests, in chiropractic as well as in the medical field.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Dr Richter and his team are fantastic to deal with and I have had a great experiance. Very knowledgable and customer focus. My back is coming along nicely and am feeling great again. Dr Richter took the time with me that other chiropractors wouldn't. He went over in detail the process and ways to repair past damage from previous car accidents that had lingered for many years. It's a business but am happy that I didnt feel like he was up-selling me on anything and were realistic options to help. Very happy I found this office. Great experiance.<//review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) I want to share with all the working Latino people that I am sure they need care from a chiropractor, that Dr. Richter is the best since I have attended his office, the headaches that were horrible have gone away and my back feels super new, and not only that, all the staff are very friendly and make you feel very special and care about your health thanks to Dr. Richter for the change in my life !! 😊😊

<rate>1</rate><review>Horrible experience! We went in to have a consultation to make sure we were ok to file and Mrs. Aydee was the one who helped us and answered our questions, assured us we were good to file!  But all the answers to the questions we asked were WRONG! We trusted H&R Block and they totally screwed us over! Heather and I believe Tania were trying to do their best to help but at the end you really cant fix this. Not even once did we recieve a call from Mrs. Aydee to even apologize for her mistake! Wont be returning here and do not recommend, we went in to have our questions answered and were given wrong information from "Tax Experts".<//review>< pics>

So, I was waiting in line after ordering and I saw a cockroach. Just one, a single one. Another customer waiting to order saw it as well, but we both didn't say anything. I watched it crawl around on the ground near someone's pant leg. I didn't want to call attention to it because I didn't want to kill it or see it killed since I like bugs.

I also didn't want to embarrass anyone who worked there or disturb any customers who were already eating, so here is me letting you guys know. Please clean up your restaurant. I really like the sandwiches. The beef for our pho we ordered smelled a bit like feet as well.
That's not to be rude, it's just an observation and it was a bit strange.
I may not go back here.
I'm sad to see this.<//Text>

Great Pho, customer service is a lot better than the one on Shaw and Fresno. The man behind the counter can be a little rude sometimes. Other the  that, it's great Pho, great Thai Tea, and great sandwiches.< /Review>

I wanted to give this place a try. It was a mistake. I came home the Meat was raw soup was cold and they charge me over 12 dollars. I tried calling them multiple times before I left a review but they don't answer and/or they hung up on me! I will never come back here again! I am so disappointed! I recommend pho 75 over this place anytime.<//Text>

When we walked in there were dirty tables all over. Once the food arrived it was worth it.  Great tasting food. Service was nice.< /Review>

Favorite pho spot. A great amount of flavors in their broth, easily the best pho (in my opinion) in Fresno.  They have a friendly service, and food wait times are good, very reasonable.  This is a great place to stop by in the winter or a cold rainy day. Great place into get introduced to pho.<//Text>

Quick lunch break spot for me and my coworkers. Huong lan continues to be good no matter where they're located. Staff appears short handed but from the looks of the lunch rush I've seen, they can handle anything while being polite. I'm a regular here.< /text>

<Text>I loved it. The pho was wonderfully flavorful. I had the beef combo. It was a huge bowl with sliced beef tenderloin, thinly shredded tripe, beef balls and beef tendon. The beef tendon was my favorite.  So tender and gelatinous. I will definitely go again.</Text><response>None< /response>< name>

The pho is delicious here! I always get the number 24 which has the rice noodles with plenty of tenderloin. The staff is friendly and the service is usually pretty fast as well. I also tried one of thereany sandwiches and it was really good too. My only gripe is that these Huang LAN pho spots are little pricier than other pho restaurants I have been to, but overall it's worth it.<//text>

<review>Food is good, service is rarely. Many times I've come here I've felt unwelcome. One time I came in and opened the door for another customer who was asian. They were quick to give her smiling service before me and when they were done they went off to do other things without saying a word to me for at least 5 mins. It was 10 mins before i was able to pick up my food which was sitting on the counter getting cold (much like their service)

If your options are limited for pho, come here but don't stay.

3 stars for the food. 1 star for overall service. That said, a select few people working here know common courtesy. Im still salty though.<//review>< Pics>

Food was good as usual, pearl drinks are perfect. However, they are threatening to take away tipa if waiters dont keep their area clean. If it wasnt clean, we wouldnt tip anyway. We tip because we find them worthy of tip..<//Text>

I love their pho number 33 large. It's lean, not too fatty, there is a good amount of meat. They are very generous with that. The noodles are about the right amount of quantity.</Review>

The banh mi here is always bomb. The pho is good too. I reccomend the fried rice combo that comes with a little side of soup to cure your soul from the sins that you've commited the night before. Other than thought the service is good. Especially when the waiter tells u to enjoy your meal and you replied back "yeah, you too" and caught yourself but its too late, luckily, the waiter understands the meme situation and you both laugh. Great place!< /Review>

I will be back to try a bowl of the pho that looked so appetizing on other diners tables!</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>I love how they're open at 8 AM!  I don't have to wait till 11 for a bowl of PHO.  I've eaten here multiple times and every time was never a disappointment.  All the dishes and sandwiches are fresh and delicious!  Great and quick service as well!  Highly recommended.<//review>< Pictures>

One of the few pho places that is generally consistent with their broth flavor. The portions in their pho dishes are also more generous than everywhere else.</text>

not the best experience for me and the prices are ridiculous. omg if the pho I paid for was worth the money man I wouldn't complain but not only was it expensive the fried rice was something I could made at home with oil and rice and egg. like really come on and the chicken I had with it was hard it could kill someone or break their teeth. that was my experience. I didn't like it all. the food and the prices are way too much for the quality of their menu.<//review>

The price hike would be ok due to the amazing food, except for the fact that thier seriously becoming skimpy with the meat that goes into the pho and Bahn Mi's. Higher prices and less meat.

<review>Food is good, but worst customer service ever! They ignore you.
We had asked a server that came by our table that we need water refills. She said "yes, okay." But 15 mins later, didnt come back.
My buddy got up to the front to ask for water refill while heading to the restroom, they "okay, we'll be right there."
Guess what, 10 min later.. no water.
Asked a third time when the server was cleaning a table by us and then 5 mins later, finally got water. SMH

My other buddy also needed something else, he raised his hand for about 10 min straight and trying to have eye contact with a server, they just pretend not to see you.< /review>< response>

The dirtiest place I've ever eaten at in my life. Almost every table dirty, there water tasted like mildew, I'm surprised there still open or health inspector hasn't come yet. Definetly do not recommend.<//text>

<Review>After my second visit I have to change my mind about this restaurant. The food is awful, the restaurant is dirty and smelly. The smell and the grease will stick to your clothes and your skin. They don't have proper ventilation so the air inside the restaurant is bad. I could not eat the bun chia yo ( egg rolls with noodles).<//Review>< rating>

Family favorite. Great pho, banh mi, and everything else. Only complaint is the interior which could use some updating, cleaning, and modernization. My kids dig the fish tanks though.< /Text>

This Huong Lan is literally so unsanitary compared to the one on Shaw. It has flies flying everywhere, 8 flying around our table and 5 literally landing on top of my friend. So disgusting, and the worker was killing the flies with a fly swatter on the tables. Yuck!....totally killing my appetite!</Text>

I eat at a lot of PHO restaurants and yes Huang Lan cost more, but as for the PHO itself, is one of the better ones in all of Fresno.  The broth is clean and flavorful, as for the meat it is fresh including the veggies.
If your looking for cost effective, go where you like, but you do pay for what you get, a pretty darn good bowl of PHO.</review>

<Text>Not the best pho in town but love their sandwiches. And I usually always buy their coconut drinks, but get less than what I should be getting. Everytime I ordered them without ice, the amount of the drink is just perfect. But everytime I ordered it with light ice, it always less than what I usually get. So from now on, I'm asking for ice on the side and do it on my own.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I always have to laugh when people complain about cleanliness at a legitimate pho restaurant. I hail from the SF Bay Area and the most authentic pho joints I've been to are consistently filthy. It just comes with the territory. That being said, Huong Lan is, hands down, the only decent place to grab a generous helping of pho in all of Fresno County. Their portion sizes are massive for the price and I always walk away happy. Their banh mi and boba thai tea also brings me to my happy place. It's a diamond in the rough, as far as I'm concerned.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!

Their pho and rice plates are good, but they NEED to work on their customer service!! My husband and I went into to enjoy a rice plate and a bowl of pho and was not greeted. Then when we where seated the server name (Shoua)  was rushing us to order and she already seemed like she was in a bad mood already but then she continued being rude and not say anything or check up on how are food was going. I guess I ordered  the wrong plate and asked if I could get it switched to the right order and she was huffing and puffing while carrying it way from our table and she was talking to her other coworker about how I selected the plate from the menu I should just eat it. 😡 we didn’t say anything, at the end of our meal I went to pay and asked for boxes to go, she slammed the box’s on the counter and I asked if I could get two and she looked like she was so annoyed with me. I asked if I could speak to her manager and as I was talking to the manager, NOT HER about how Shoua shouldn’t treat customer that way because if it makes me feel uncomfortable I’m sure it makes a lot of the customers feel the same. But no, she was butting  into the convo and was looking straight at me and was like “ ok, ok, whatever” and her manager did not say anything! She didn’t even apologize for how NASTY her server was acting so I said thanks and we left. They lost a loyal customer and probably will NEVER GO BACK.
BEWARE OF THE SERVER SHOUA!!< /text>

Omg I didn’t know it was possible to review restaurants on this! That just blew my mind. BWW is my most favorite spot to get wings. And they always reach the mark. I like wet seasonings. Mango Habanero and Garlic Parmesan are my personal favorites. Yesterday, I tried their Nachos for the first time. It was really good. I added Grilled chicken to it. They were maintaining very good social distancing. Tables were clean and placed far apart. No overcrowding. They provided plenty of alcohol wipes. The waitress was very tentative and had her mask on well. Good COVID wing experience!< /review>

Not a good experience, there is not much staff in the restaurant to help and you have to wait almost an hour for your food. Please check your wings before eating them because the wings we received were not cooked fully.</Review>

<Review>Kelly was an awesome waitress! She was attentive and very kind. The service was pretty quick for a Friday evening and the beers on tap weren’t bad at all I would come here again just for the service</Review>< Resp>

At first I thought this would be a 1 star review. The table and chairs were wet and the receipt from the last people was glued to the table. It took at least 15 minutes before someone took the receipt and they didn't even acknowledge us. Finally the server came by and cleaned up the table. She was very nice and helpful. I wish I could give a better review, but I just can't considering how long we had to wait for them to clean our table or even talk to us.</Text>

< review>
Ordered my lunch through the app for a specific time. Came in and it still wasn’t ready. Made me wait 30 mins past my pick up time. It’s ridiculous. If they are short staffed then they need to accommodate. It’s the middle of the lunch rush. Horrible experience. Very unacceptable.<//review>

I was waiting for 30 minutes more than what time suppose to be. I know the workers work hard and very friendly. But the owners need better more workers or a better way to serve. I used to buy food to go but this Sunday I had a but experienced.<//Text>

The wings of this place were flavorless. They put less sauce and the wings tasted like boiled chicken. Only one person helped to order when they're crowded. At least she was nice.<//Review>

<Review>BWW is dependable - you know what you're going to get, whichever location you visit. One plus in the pandemic: buffalo wings hold up to takeout better than many/most fast casual options. Would be nice if they had more side options that weren't fried, because that stuff doesn't do well after it site for a few minutes on the way home.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>The most disgusting wings I have ever had in my life. I am NOT exaggerating when I say my nephew and I ate two or three day old, STALE wings. It was disgusting. Don't get me started on the fries. They were hard and were definitely reheated in a microwave. You could taste that stale, old, cheap taste. Ill never be back to this location.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>I haven't been to a BWW in many years but stopped in to watch a basketball game and have beers and snacks.  What a disappointment with the food being very mediocre, much smaller BWW than I'm used to and no sound on the TVs.  There are much better places to watch games, eat and drink.< /text></record>

Great ambience with lots of flat screen TVs everywhere and lots of outdoor seating too! Happy Hour until 7pm. Good food and good service. Just note that two thirds of the indoors is designated as bar seating with high top tables, yet only the bar counter itself is first come first serve seating. The high top tables require you to put your name down and wait. The chicken tacos are great. The fried mushrooms are great. The fried pickles are not that great because they're thick sliced and the breading is falling off. The Bourbon Honey Mustard is my favorite wing sauce.</Text>

Amending my review: I strongly recommend sitting at the bar if at all possible. The service is much faster and the quality is just as good!

The quality of the wings is pretty good (and what you'd expect from a wing joint) but the service is just so damned slow as to not be worth it. Also, we had an empty soda glass waiting at the edge of the table for a refill, and at least different people (including our waitress!) walked past it without picking it up. Our stay was an hour and a half, but we could have easily shaved 30 minutes off if they'd been more prompt.</Text>

Hopefully this helps you decide whether to visit this location or go to one a mile further. Wings were only half seasoned and celery sticks were close to molding. Learn from my mistake and go to different one.

UPDATE: Was contacted by a manager after posting this. There way to solve this problem was to give me a voucher for a free SNACK size of wings after spending 35 dollars for a order that was thrown together. Didn't accept the voucher not worth wasting the time to go back.<//Text>

I placed an order online, when I got home I was missing 10 wings. I called to get a refund and was on hold for 15min, I hung up and called back again. Was put on hold for another 10 min, hung up and called but again for the 3rd time apparently I’m waiting for a manager as they are busy with people sitting inside eating, outside and take out. I though you were only allowed take out and out door seating at this time. Not this place!!!</text>

It's not possible to give this place zero stars. If we had not talked to the manager I don't believe we would have received our order. We ordered our drinks and appetizers but no one came back to take our order. When the waitress finally came back she didn't wait for a response when she had already passed by and was taking the order from the next table. When she finally passed by again she brushed me off and said she be right back. When she came back she had an attitude didn't write our order down. We waited over 30 minutes to finally see food. This was after an hour of being sat down and talking to the manager. Love the food but not worth the service.  Not coming back to this place.

Thank you very much to a helpful manager.< /Text>

It wasn't too busy last night when we arrived but tables were left dirty our entire time there.  There were crumbled chips and trash all over the floor.  Server after server came by the tables were patrons were no longer sitting but no one took anything away.  Had it been busy I would understand but it wasn't.  Definitely didn't leave any desire to return to this location again. Made me wonder if the customer area was this filthy, what the kitchen looked like.< /Text>

I ordered 10 pieces of wings + fries through official website at 6:40 PM. The estimated time for pickup was 7:00 PM. On this time I already was on place and waited for 20 more minutes. First in application the pickup time changed to 7:10, then to 7:15. So I waited totally for 10 pieces of wings 40 minutes. When in 5 minutes I opened the box with food, it was almost cold, the food in a box looked like a mess, since there were no sections in the box.
Please fix you application so the estimated time would not delay constantly, but showing the average amount of waiting time, because right now there is an impression that Buffalowildwings doesn't care about people time.

<Text>The worst food, service I had at this place ever,

female restroom no toilet paper, no paper towels to dry hands, males restroom where durty too,

we got sit on a dirty table, they stared spraying the table to clean it when we were sit, chicken so dry, fries no well cook we wait, never refil for drinks,

Just to paid we had to wait 10 minutes to get someone to charged us,

I asked for manager, at the end manager try to make it better, but where it was the manager all this time, the team works how the management let them be,

but after all the bad experience,  gift cards dosen't change tha bad experience.</Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Manny Legacy (MannyLegacy)<//user_name><Review>I live around the corner and every time I come here they mess up my order. And since it's a To-go order there's no way of complaining and getting it fixed right away. Yesterday I ordered using the app, for a pickup at 430pm. I ordered around 3pm. I get to the restaurant @430pm and am told that it's being bagged in the back and will be right out. At 453pm,....over 20 mins of waiting inside with an uncomfortable mask on,  my order is finally ready. WHY ORDER AHEAD OF TIME IF I'M STILL GOING TO MADE TO WAIT FOR OVER 20 MINS?? It defeats the entire purpose of ordering ahead so you don't havey to wait 😡 Then I get home and the order is wrong,..... As usual. Needless to say I will NEVER be back to this location. It's ridiculous that EVERY time I come here something is wrong.</Review></record>

I live 2 min away from this BWW and I have been going to this BWW for years and today 7/30/20 I came with a party of 7 to watch the clippers vs lakers and came 1 hour early and they tell me it $25 per table to eat there. I was shocked how this place decided to charge $25 per table horrible. I called 3 different BWW and not one said they charge to watch the game. This BWW lost a good customer and im gonna buy from costa mesa location better because the fact that you guy want to take advantage to watch a basketball game is ridiculous i would understand if it was a PPV game or something but its not.</Review>

You're better off getting a six pack and chilling at home. What is great about this place is that it is near South coast plaza and other fast food spots.

<Review>The wings here are really good and so is the customer service. We were seated quickly. Had fun watching the game on the television. Why are their carrots so good here?? They have a good variety of sauces so you're never bored with flavors here. I enjoyed my whole experience here. Parking is easy too, they have a large lot. We came here on a friday night and there were hardly any people. Overall, great experience.<//Review>< user>

<date>1584159375632< /date><review>First, our waiter could care less if we were customers. We had to practically wave him over like a airline ground guide. After a long wait...well the waiter throw our food down as it was slop. As we were eating mid-way the waiter brought over left over boxes and bags took our plates as if it is time to go. This is the second time at this location where paying customers are not treated with the respect. I urge caution to visit this location...God speed if you do.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Super sketchy. Came here. Placed an order in the takeout. Was asked to take a seat at any table in the waiting area. Watched while 3-4 people came and gone from one or another table with no masks and the establishment isn’t wiping down the tables when people leave who are sitting on inside... it’s just one person sits then another sits ...  Super unclean. Didn’t even get my order. Asked for a refund and walked out. Disgusting.< /review>< Pics>

1) 15 minutes late to original pickup time - not ideal when it is your lunch break, but I can deal with it.

2) Asked for ranch with carrots - forgets ranch

3) Asked for sauce on the side - sauce on the wings

Come on now, B dubs you can do better.</text>

<review>Food was nice but not worth the price or the 20 min wait for the takeout. Ate at this place 3 times, first time, dined in, was a great experience. The second time we went in, we were ignored and staff were rudely dismissive, so we walked out. Tonight we decided its been long enough that we should try again. The girl at take out counter couldn't even smile at us and spoke the bare minimum to achieve the order. When we went back to collect, we thought she smiled for a second, but no, we were met with the same uninterested, 'here take it and get out' vibe.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><name>LX NS< /name>< gmapID>

Food was good as usual,  but service was very slow. In fairness it was Sunday afternoon football, but lunch took over 2 hours and we waited 30 minutes for the check after  flagging down the server.  They were clearly understaffed.</Review>

It was a Thursday evening and I had spent my whole evening playing basketball. My teammates and I were exhausted and we shared a common interest in going to buffalo wild wings. We ubered to the nearest one and saw there would be a wait. We asked and they said it would be a mere 20 minutes. We decided to wait and went outside, however after 20 minutes we were not even close to being shown to a table.

The longer we waited I could feel the hunger gnawing away at me. My strength was fading and standing was starting to become impossible. I managed to lift my head  and looked despairingly at my teammates. The bleak look in their eyes told me that we couldn't do this much longer. Our bodies desperately needed calories...

I wouldn't wish this on the worst of my enemies. The strife buffalo wild wings put us through this night was inexcusable...< /Text>

<Review>I made it before last call for drinks but it took the server longer just to let me know they didn't have the adios I wanted or the Irish drink she recommended. And when I finally settled for a beer she said I couldn't order anymore, even though it was the place's fault for not having the drinks I wanted . Very disappointed. We even gave her a fat tip . Won't be coming here again.<//Review>< Date>

My sandwich came about 30 minutes later than the rest of my party's food.  15 minutes after the rest of the party's food came, the waitress came to tell me they were out of the specific cheese used on the sandwich, and asked if they could substitute it for something else. The hell do I care what cheese is on the sandwich, I just want to eat and get out! And why wasn't my sandwich ready, with the substituted cheese at the same time as the rest of the food? Had a great time watching my friends eat, then eating my medicore sandwich at my desk. Didn't ruin bww for me, but won't be returning to this one.< /text>

I was not successful in trying to place a take-out order on my smartphone, had to order in person instead.  The food is pretty good, but it is not cheap.  If you want inexpensive fast food, there are places in the neighborhood that are better for that.  If you like sitting at a sports bar with many screens with different games showing, and you don't mind a noisy environment, this might be the place for you.  A place for a quiet, relaxing dinner out it is not.</Review>

Horrible service , took forever to bring the food and our food was cold . We order fries and they were cold  and hard , like if they were old fries. Didn't had any of the salad dressing we wanted. They gave us plastic forks because they run out of silverware.   The place was very dirty , when you walk you could feel the carpet was very sticky. Never coming to this place again.</review>

I haven't eaten here in a while got an ad in the mail for buy one get one for the wings so decided to go after work I tried to call at 915 no answer so when I got off at 930 get there at 940 music is blasting Jesus walks with me by Kanye walk over to the counter see and hear the phone ringing but no one is around so I'm guessing the music blasting is the reason they didn't here my call then a lady walks over with a cash register asking if I have been helped I say no and then ask if I'm picking up and I say no I want to place an order she then says oh I'm not placing any now we stop at 930 though they close at 10 I was so heated I just walked out will never go back here again< /Text>

Unfortunately my friend and i came in and our food was significantly delayed, I spoke to Jeff, whom was the manager on duty, and he sincerely apologized, and expedited our order, we had Bill take over on our table, and he responded with immaculate service, was very involved at our table and made sure we were taken care of, food was delicious as always

Wack service, went in at 330 had a beer ordered 10 wings and left after almost 20 minutes of no food, is my review biased based on the fact that I am really hungry, probably. Still the staff was acting laid back, I assume a shift change, avoid the early stages of happy hour. I usually on order to go through the app, since I work in the area.< /Text>

I work 8 hours. I only get one hour of a lunch. I did the right thing, to call for takeout order. The staff confirmed my order and said it will be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. So I waited at work until it passed the 15 minutes. When I was at the takeout to pick up my order, they said it should be ready in a few. Next to me was a lady that recently ordered on site. 25 minutes later she received her order and I did not. Finally, I went to ask a staff about my order. It took another 15 minutes. Once I got my order, there was no time for me to eat. I skipped my LUNCH. I was crying of anger because someone should've told me something and I definitely didn't want to make a scene. Bad experience.

I'm even a blazin rewards member, I go to other locations without this problem.< /Text>

We really wanted to like this place because we enjoy wings so much. But every time we tried it it took forever to get something as simple as a 6-piece order of wings. The little salad on the side were so tiny and we're basically lettuce and carrots. Last time we were there we waited over 45 minutes for one order of bone-in wings and one order of chicken tenders.< /text>

<Text>service was very slow. burger came out quite warm. our waiter disappeared on us for a very long time. never got a water refill. the packaged towelettes were all gone. a manager that came out of nowhere somehow was sent by the gods because he checked in how we were doing and we just told me were not having it. it took almost an 45 min to get some wings and a hamburger out to us. just wished all the buffalo wild wings were fully staffed.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We love going to Buffalo wild wings but this particular one was just a little too dirty there was napkins underneath the tables not one but a few. The tables for a little sticky and so were our seats. However the food and the service was great.<//text>

<Review>We came to bww on a saturday evening. Were seated in the patio section. Ordered our food right away. Food was brought out timely. After our food was brought out, we didnt see much from server. We had to keep trying to get her a attention. We were left with no napkins and no towelettes.Lets just say our basket of fries was not really a basket of fries. It had less than half. Seemed as if someone had ate half of the fries before they were served. Our ranch cups were filled with less than half of ranch. We had to ask for additional ranch. Food was good but needs better service.< /Review>< Response>

< review>
For the last 2 years every Thursday my wife and I go to Buffalo Wild Wings. We have our go to spots but also try new locations. This particular location is literally 2 blocks from our house, but we try to avoid it when we can. They are over staffed however still manage terrible and slow service. The food is always dry even after we say extra wet, and never consistent. Multiple times our mozzarella sticks have come out cold, the cheese inside is literally a block.

Twice we've been sat in dirty tables, I assumed after the waiter took our drink order they would come back to clean it. Thank corporate for providing those wet wipes, which I used to clean the table.

If you do come to this locations ask to sit in Bills section, best server there.

I'll take a trip here just to take pictures of the food, I'll edit my post with the images soon.</review>

Delicious food and great flavors. If you're looking for a romantic date, not the best place...its pretty loud and has TVs on constantly with a slew of sports. Great place for sports fans though!<//Review>

If I can give it zero stars I would! Worst customer service ever! Dess was serving me and my buddies at first. She was great and assisted us with drinks pretty fast. I’m assuming her shift was over or something and some guy named Ryan Le becomes our server. This guy was THE WORST. He spent most of his time picking up other people’s cups and trash than to bring us our food. Kid you not, 30 minutes later he brings us our food and sure thing the fries and wings were barely even warm. We all finished and took us another 30 minutes to even give us our check and another 15 to give us our cards back. To conclude this horrible service he charged me extra for who knows what but at that point I didn’t care how much it was I just wanted to leave.</Text>

Overpriced , small wings with very little meat on the bone, waited too long for a to  go order. Spinach dip was very good .You can get much better tasting wings way cheaper  down the street at  The Halal Guys on Bristol . They also have a place called Dough & Arrow a few doors away where I purchased the most unbelievable cookies ever! Try the creme brulee one it's spectacular.<//review>

<Review>It's Bdubs. Even though we got there at a hot time, 6pm, we were able to do the "self seating" and get in and out with our food in our bellies by a little before 7! The service was fast, and the food was good. Bdubs doesn't have the best wings I've ever had, but they're pretty good comparatively to other places. There was plenty of parking, and the service was quick.< /Review>< Rate>

Our wings were warm when they arrived and our server basically gave us no service. She didn't check on us once and we kept having to stop her in the middle of helping other tables because she never checked on us.< /Review>

<Review>Terrible experience! Ordered online and got the store when they said the order was ready. Not only did it take 30 minutes for my order to be ready once I arrived but it was cold once I got never order ahead only dine in and this location. If you order ahead get it from a different location I am never coming here again.< /Review></record>

Bdubs is my favorite wing spot! Lots of gripes at this location because it is a lot smaller than most bdubs and the host are not very efficient with sitting guests.  This bdubs still gets 4 stars because of the service of Dawn, our waitress. After having to go through the long wait to be seated, being seated on a table that was not fully clean, and now being hangry, Dawn quickly turned the evening in to a positive experience. We placed the dirty tray that had been left behind at the corner of the table so the next employee that passed could take it away. 4 waitresses passed before and ignored the tray until Dawn walked by and said "where did this come from??? I'm so sorry it was left here" and she took it away. The rest of the evening was full of her attentive service that turned what could have been a negative experience at bdubs in to a very positive experience. Thanks again Dawn!< /text>

<Text>Worse experience of my family life. Management is horrible. Accused one of my family members of stealing someone else's money in the bathroom, let the other person and 2 managers approaches in an aggressive way when we had six kids with us and my sister in law is 5 months pregnant. The cops were called on us and even the cops thought it was a joke. We didn't even get to eat our food. Bad enough the person that approaches in an aggressive way was a teenager and we are all over 30 years old. The cops even told the manager to calm down because he was screaming at me. After the cops were laughing and left one manager came up to us and apologized. The other manager left and didn't apologize at all. I will never recommend this place to anybody or go there again.< /Text>< pics>

<review>My Own Personal Option --

I do NOT NOT like This restaurant at
all !!

I will NOT Come back again !!

#1
The FOOD Quality is Very POOR.
Super DRY, Tiny size and Stiff
Chicken Wings...

Supermarket' s Frozen Chicken Wings
has MUCH BETTER quality than
This Restaurant.

The Cost and Performance Ratio
is LOW....

EXPENSIVE Food and Beverage,
with Small Tiny portion of the
Food...

#2

It was okay. I sat at the bar but you can tell the bartender just wanted the night to end. Sucks, I had to be generous and smile a lot for her to provide good service. Felt like I was working to get good service.</Text>

<Review>Alex lacks customer service skills. No eye contact at all. I was there picking up an order and I got there a few minutes before my pick up time. When I got in the store no one was at the counter to help for at least 5 minutes. Another gentleman was waiting to be helped before I arrived. And another gentleman arrived after me. We all waited another few minute until finally a Alex came out to help us. He took down all our names. We all waited 10 mins after that and finally food came out which none of them were mine. So I asked again on my order status to Alex. His response was “we are very busy” with no eye contact. There was no, “sorry for the wait” or “let me check on your order” nothing! It was 20mins past my pick up time and everyone (at least 5 other people) that was there already left with their food. I finally got my food. Never again. I’ll cancel my order next time I have to wait more then 10 mins. Thanks Alex for your awesome customer service.< /Review>< pics>

Not a good place for a large (15) group of people. Not enough servers for the amount of customers, therefore long wait times for everything. I attempted to call ahead for reservations but they Do Not take any. If you like food that spicy, even the other items that are not wings or chicken, then this is a place to go.< /Review>

Very good wings, meaty, good size, not overcooked, just enough sauce. Food can in just under 15 mins, but the timer didn't start for a full minute so I might have an argument for a free meal. 😂 Overall, great experience and will go again.< /text>

Worst customer service experience I've had in quite a while. I arrived just as the food was supposed to come out. The food was THIRTY minutes late. In that time, I wasn't offered any drink or even a seat or any updates about my food!! when the food finally came out, two of the sides of sauces I had ordered weren't there. Instead of trusting me (why would I lie about a $1.20 value?), staff had to go back into the kitchen and check my order. Then, they sent me off, unapologetic. I've worked in the food industry, even when the customer is wrong and complains we give them a free drink voucher or a gift card. In this case -- a thirty minute extraneous wait and an incorrect order -- I think that at least an apology was in order. Never coming back here -- the BWW in Irvine at least knows how to treat its customers</Review>

As a big fan of BWW, I was sadly disappointed by the quality of both the food and service at this location. I came to this location with a group of 11. I understand that large groups may be difficult, but for a Tuesday night and an almost empty restaurant, 55 minutes between arrival and food is ridiculous. Additionally, the food came out in 4 different waves. By the time the last person got their food, everyone else was finished. Also, the restrooms we're disgusting and reflect poorly on BWW as a whole. My rewards points did not work and I paid for a meal that should have been completely covered by my points. All in all, if you are looking to grab lunch or dinner in the area, you're better off at McDonalds across the street .< /Text>

< Review>
I love wings and so far these are my favorite I go every week once but honestly I  have ran into so many upsetting situations with  this place. I've been debating whether to write a review or not but after yesterday I decided too. There are TWO carry out parking spots that were taken from someone that was dinning in because when I got there, their was ONE lady in the carry out Registry   getting her order after she left the other car was still there which at the time I was the only one picking up my order to leave. So I had to park all the way where CVS is at to just CARRYOUT my order. I mention it to the MANAGER which didn't care. That is horrible  customer service  and disrespectful from whoever takes those parking's! then after that I get there all the girls in the front desk for carryout have no customer service greeting they have a face like if they just didn't want to be there, 2nd my order was wrong and I had to wait after it was brought to me they forgot my sauce and you tell them and they give you this attitude when you clearly placed your order through the phone which they have it WRITTEN and still didn't get right. LOL Lastly, I could have easily just left and not paid because they didn't even know I didn't pay till I had to tell them I haven't paid. I know there might be many KARLAS  but there is one specific KARLA that I dont know her last name but this Karla she is a petite,  black hair girl, makeup always on point she is a server now SHE HAS BEEN THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICES PERSON I adore her and always had my order right. Keep in mind this was just yesterday plus all the other times that I've had issues with but if i mention them ALL I will never finish.< /Review>

<text>I called this place because I love their wings, Alisa I believe was her name answered and placed me on hold for a minute or so she said, I was on hold for 9 minutes and she never came back. I hung up and called again, same person answered and after I told her I had been waiting for 9 minutes she she said “ oh I am so sorry about that let me put you on a brief hold and I will be right back to help you”  and she went on to put me on hold AGAIN. Very annoyed right now,  even do I love their food. If they don’t have enough people on busy nights to answer the phones they should really hire some more.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf2edf261ff1:0xb9945945c70b4c20< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Theu bring a burger with lettuce and dressing on it. We send it back and we get the same burger bacl with the dressing scrapped off and still pieces of lettuce on the bun and mayo still on the edges of the bun. Then we decide we are going to order something else. It took forever to get our replacement plate. The manager didnt cpme and apologize once. The waitress was great by the way and we left her a good tip but this is a perfect example of how your cooks play a big pary on customer service. The reason why this was important was because my girlfriend is allergic to mayonnaise so if she would of ate that it would of ruined our whole night. We wont be coming to this one anymore cooks like that.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

<text>Terrible place to eat, waiter was rude, food was NOT good for the price, and to top it off these idiots tried to charge me $100 when my original bill was $27 (with $3 tip which wasn’t deserved at all), my bank told me the waiter also tried to make the bill $40, which I’m guessing he tried to give himself an extra tip. Would NOT recommend anybody eating here and I definitely won’t be back.<//text>< user_name>

Well I visited this place a few weeks ago. And I forgot my waiters name. I don't know maybe a "Ryan". No idea, however he was outstanding. Let's make this funny he was Caucasian about 5.9, very short hair. Probably near 40 years old. I can't wait to see you again. You treated me like a queen. @thequeenofvenice 😉< /text>

Deserves a top rating for the excellent service.  Kaylynn was the best hostess I've encountered at any such place in a long time.
We've all had wings, and there was nothing different about the food than any of the better locations in this franchise.
But the service was exceptional, and when you're serving up menu items I can buy practically anyplace in town, exceptional service provided by Kaylynn is really the only thing that puts you above the competition.
Well this joint has it!< /Review>

<Review>We went as a group of four and then became five. Our first server was very accommodating and seated us in a new area.

Our second server was nice enough but was very slow. The food was what you would expect from a chain.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf2edf261ff1:0xb9945945c70b4c20<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I went with coworkers after work (12AM) and the server forgot to bring my drink 3 times and it took about 40 minutes to get our wings and when we did get our food it was SUPER dry. like they've been out for a while. They ended up giving us a discount cause none of us (4 in total) ate our wings because of how disgusting it was. It was my 1st time at this location and never again.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Try the bourbon honey mustard wings. I think they're a temporary item, but they are good enough to be permanent!
Wish the bar had more seating; this place is always busy.</Text>

<review>REVIEW FOR THIS LOCATION ONLY:

STAFF AND SERVICE: 1/5
Service is pretty slow, wait staff will almost always conveniently forget to add points to your account after you leave, and they often take more than one attempt to get your order correct for takeaways.

Ricardo, the manager, forgot twice to follow through on his promise to send gift card for takeaway orders they messed up. Convenient again, right?

AMBIENCE AND LOCATION: 3/5
Situated in the heart of Orange County’s premier shopping area, South Coast Plaza, this location is pretty big with plenty of seating capacity and options. Sports and channel selection is always on spot. Parking can be an issue on weekends and Tue/Thurs nights.

FOOD: 3/5
The wings are amazing, although they are usually out of few sauces on the list, especially the new and limited-time ones. Boneless wings can sometimes be smaller than McDonald’s nuggets (LOL) for an entire order - so watch out for those, complain to you waiter, and avoid being ripped off.< /review><user_id>114150359133751303016</user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

Check out these wild wild wings if you already haven't! Loved the tenders. If you have the spice tolerance go for the extra hot sauces. Recommend the habanero sauce.< /Text>

<Review>Terrible service for a big party. Signed in at 7:30pm and they claimed 35 minute wait for a party of 8. Then went in at 8 to see how much longer and the same girl who said a 35 minute wait suddenly changed it to well it depends on the people when they leave. If we wouldve known that from the start we wouldn't be so upset.<//Review></record>

Long wait time to be seated (30+ mins). Once we were seated it took about 20 more mins to get our order out. Then another 20 mins to get our food. Location is very dirty. Some staff are great while others have a very bad attitude. You sometimes even have to remind them on how to so their job. Ex: get us boats,straws,  Utensils, etc..< /Text>

<Review>The Filipino fellow with the bandana was giving us terrible attitude he obviously did not want to give us the free snack even though it was my birthday and I had the blazin rewards app :(. My friend has ordered a medium, he said the medium came with 18 pieces and my friend only got 12. The waiter was terrible he shouldn't be working with customers at all. He rushed me by picking up the trash before I had finished. I have seen this fellow at the gym and he had been wearing the exact same headband that he wore to work. I am low-key pissed I am not coming back the customer service sucks!<//Review>< pictures>

<Pics>None</Pics><rating>3<//rating><Text>I'm normally a fan of Buffalo Wild Wings, but the food here was a bit on the meh side. First, we weren't given carrots and celery for our entire meal. I mean the food was decent, but it didn't meet the expectations I have for BWW. The mozzarella cheese sticks were a bit stale and the ranch tasted a little old. The wings didn't have the amount of flavor that I like in my wings. The interior is like every other Buffalo Wild Wings, but it was a bit smaller. Overall, I'm a little disappointed of this place....</Text>< resp>

<text>For the price the food is not as good as other locations. They are skimpy with the sauce on dried out wings. I've tried this place three times and sad to say only one of them had fresh juicy wings but with same light coating of sauce. Also, the wait.....im not sure if it is on purpose but there was not one time the server even acknowledged the table in a timely manner. Even when there is less then 5 tables it still took a long time to actually get a basket of wings. But when it's busy, the crowd is loud.  Not in a good way but in an obnoxious 30-40 something teenager way. It's sad cause i love other BWW but the one right next door is just not worth it.< /text>< response>

Food was good but service is slow. Took a long time for our drinks, a long time for our entrees, the appetizers we ordered came out after our food (and we had to ask where apps were). Took about 20 mins to try and catch the eye of a server to get our check. Iced tea was hella watered down.</text>

I try to order by phone, but they said only walking orders available. So I went to the store and I ordered boneless Wild chicken. At that time some body call and ordered chicken over the phone. lol Finally, they gave me just fried chicken with little seasoning. lol
Good bye Buffalo.<//review>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>One of the worst restaurant experiences ever! I was excited to come to this BWW because of it's location but will not come back. Last night, I came in with a group of 9 to enjoy some wings and football Sunday. Friends arrived and grabbed the bar seating, but wait; apparently this location doesn't understand what bar seating means. Bar seating is NOT bar seating! WTF!! The manager Gabe, told our group the tables we found is bar seating, but we had to wait and put our name down on the list. So back in line we went. Management needs to be trained. After waiting, we were finally seated in the patio area.

Food took way....too long! I understand it's busy but come on, do we really need to wait a hour for the food? Our server Mario was nice us enough to take separate checks for each person but "pretended" to write each order on his notepad. Forget about receive the checks in a timely manner and correct. After 1 hour of waiting the checks arrived but of course it was wrong. I gave him a pass because everyone makes mistakes. But come on really, you get my check wrong another 3 times? Took over a hour just for our group to pay.

Basically, STAY AWAY from this location. It's not worth your time. Staff is poor because the management is HORRID! Will not be coming back to this location unless it's under new management.< /Review><time>1419866030286</time><Name>Ian - Fr0wnZ</Name>< user_id>

Order about $50 worth of food through grubhub to have delivered to my hotel. They sent my wife's salad with NO dressing, they didn't send my dips for my wings either. You would think when people pay that much money, they would double check the order before it leaves. Super irritated. DISAPPOINTED!!!< /Text>

Its hit or miss with the servers. Food is always good, but sometimes they mess up your order. They always correct it with an additional small wait time, but take responsibility. The drinks are on the strong side, but thats better than them making it light. The parking is not that great even with how big the lot is, but there is additional parking with a slight walk<//text>

The service here is a lot better than the one in Brea, but it's also a lot smaller. I took off a star because their Sculpin always tastes a little off. I thought it was me but my coworker agreed as well.< /Review>

They are always super busy, but the servers are great. Food was good. We went in on Friday around 9pm with a big group of 15 people,  took about 45minutes, but the managers were both there an on top of things.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>i came to this restaurant  during opening week and it was horrible.  1st, there were waiters who randomly went to tables asking if we ordered appetizers, if we ordered more utenzils, they took us another tables drinks, the waiters were very unorganized and did not know what food n drinks went to which table.

we were seated outside and asked them to roll the curtains down because the sun was hittting us in the face...apparently the curtains dont roll down.

when it came to paying...it took our server 20 mins to bring the check.  i walked up to the front and payed there.  i asked to talk to a manager and they couldnt find one...really?

i will gladly now drive past this one to go to another buffalo wild wings.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
i came to this restaurant  during opening week and it was horrible.  1st, there were waiters who randomly went to tables asking if we ordered appetizers, if we ordered more utenzils, they took us another tables drinks, the waiters were very unorganized and did not know what food n drinks went to which table.

we were seated outside and asked them to roll the curtains down because the sun was hittting us in the face...apparently the curtains dont roll down.

when it came to paying...it took our server 20 mins to bring the check.  i walked up to the front and payed there.  i asked to talk to a manager and they couldnt find one...really?

i will gladly now drive past this one to go to another buffalo wild wings.< /Review>

< Review>
Rolled in last week to check it out. Sat at he bar, ordered a beer (or 3) watched a little football, paid my tab and was out Rolled into the bar tonight (Monday, Jan 5 super slow, holiday BS over) sat at a bar table and after being passed up by 4 or 5 servers was finally greeted by a gal who asked, if this is where I was gonna sit - in other words, how dare you sit a table meant for 4 persons Mr Single guy! Oh shizznat there goes my check average! Yes miss not so interesting server girl, this is where I'm gonna sit can you, please bring me a Dos Equis....What I'm sorry, did you say you need to see my ID? Oh wow, why thank you, thank you for the compliment or should I say insult...I'm 54 years young why in the hell are you asking for my ID? Policy, policy my a**....where's the manager! Along comes mini Mex, all 5 foot nothing and who irreverently addresses me with a greeting of "hey boss what's up? I got your boss right here! After mini Mex tried unsuccessfully to explain their "We ID everyone policy" I unapologetically dropped a couple "F" bombs and opted out of this below average establishment. BWW spent alotta money building this place however after my shameful and embarrassing experience they should restrategize their ID policies and train their managers and servers to interact with guests on a more sophisticated, intelligent level<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad if you are a delivery person because I took the order 10 minutes before I arrived, I told them that I had to wait for an order for 5 minutes, then another 10 minutes came out, then he asked me and I told him he told me that I had to tell him my order and wait from 25 to 30 minutes that's why I don't recommend it

(Original)
Mal si eres repartidor porque agarre lanorden 10 minutos antes de llegar llegue les dije que benia por una orden me dijo espera 5 minutos luego salio otro 10 minutos despues me pregunto y le dije me dijo que tenia que decirle mi orden y esperar de 25 a 30 minutos por eso no lo recomiendo<//review>

(Translated by Google) They even leave you waiting for a table and they tell you 20 min. I would feel more comfortable if they told me that it would take 1 hour for them to lie to me by telling me 20 and it happened to me 2 times in the Real Madrid vs Liverpool game and in the Mexico vs Wales game they were not broadcasting the game

(Original)
Te dejan hasta una esperando mesa y te dicen 20 min. Me sentiria mas cómodo q me digan que tardaran 1 hora a que me mientan diciendome 20 y me ocurrió 2 veces en el partido real Madrid vs Liverpool y en el de México vs gales no estaban transmitiendo el partido<//Text>
