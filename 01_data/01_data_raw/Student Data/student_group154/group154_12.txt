<rating>1< /rating><review>I've posted a few challenges with Velociter Wireless in the past.  Sadly, our most recent experience is the most disturbing and nefarious.  Three months ago they were calling us wanting to change a perfectly good router.  We finally were getting decent service and reluctantly agreed against our better judgement.  The technician told us Velocitor was getting 'bad codes' so we need the new router.  The new replacement brought us back to poor service.  They were in the attic most of the time and when it was all done we had nothing but the slow standard of Velociter.

It gets way worse,  I notice that on the new installation they put the cable through our main alarm box control panel and through the wall damaging some contacts in our system.  Jennifer dismiss it saying she needed to talk with the technician who installed it.  Jennifer's  service was deplorable, her attitude atrocious and and her lack of concern heinous.

Make no mistake, going through a main alarm control box and then through the wall IS NOT GOOD PRACTICE.

Jennifer has brought a new low to Velociter and it is egregious.  We are completely shocked and never would. have thought installers would take short cuts that put our families safety at risk.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP52FW7dv5pr6G4BusSP7mBdrl1vb76r9n_MjCi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO34aG-xk64w4Y9qn7ZxoMYGm8Jk2A6IyDCJX2e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSDjal8Alwu932F8A2aNhLA1t6Hh81LjqOU3Dg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

THIS WIFI IS TRASH!!! I upgraded to the unlimited (the most expensive) and still does not work, have called multiple times and they tell me everything is fine with the wifi connection when its clearly not. They also charge you a cancelation fee and I did not know that you have to give them a months notice to cancel it and they will charge you for the following moths wifi even if you already have a mother provider. and you also have to send an email to said support but I emailed them 9 days ago and still no response . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEIR WIFI.</text>

Nothing but problems from the  beginning, never  a solution, only an excuse,. Purchased highest plan,like  throwing money to the wind. Why can't people be  honest? If you  can't provide a service, why not  be honest? Instead they don't  correct any  problems, but they  surely take auto pay every month. Funny, the  internet seems to always work on that day. Wonder what provider they use.<//Text>

<Text>First of all  they are a great provider for internet . Especially since nothing else is available where I live in Linden. Anytime I need a tech I’m not waiting for long periods of time. Service is great with no interruptions.  I would however prefer 2/mo billing @ a time opposed to the month. As for the 2 reviews below, I’ve had nothing but a pleasant experience with this company.</Text></record>

<Time>1615588704577< /Time><review>The wifi is decent but out where I live this is one of the only companies that can actually give you wifi out in the country, my only complaint is that I’m paying $50 for 5 mbps Speeds and only like 2 people in my house can use it no problem. Oh and there is times that it cuts off for hours but you can call them to get that resolved, and I heard that there putting more antennas out in the country so hopefully they have better prices with more faster speeds, I’m just a little upset that I have family members that are paying like 30 bucks for speeds that are in the 50 mbps, I’ve been with this company for like 5 years or longer but no complaints about there customer service, there really nice people and they try to help you out in any way shape or form, but overall if I ever move out of the country I’ma switch companies 🥺 I can’t be at 5mbps for ever.</review><UserId.>104375852254440362954<//UserId.>< pictures>

<review>Follow up on the velociter service!
Again, the only thing reliable about the  service; out at high peak times or so slow you call.  Tech goes through a script and you will get a 'ticket' to resolve the issue days later.  Miraculously issues will disappear before then.<//review>< username>

Been a customer with them for over 3 years now
I live in and area that doesnt get serviced by comcast or any other provider ( rural area )
So I was a little existant to try this, the speed advertise is the speed I get over 95 percent of the time.
**netflix **
Can safely stream too tvs with out buffering ( I did lower and a void streaming in 4k I usually lower it to 1080p  )  I have the top tier service 10mbps

***** Gamers *****
Over all I can play on xbox live with out any lag.
Fortnite
Call of duty
Battlefield
My connection is usually between 35 to 85ms on a rare bad spike 100ms  ( your millage with vary depending on your distance to the tower I'm about 1.3 miles away)
Over all this service has been fantastic.  I haven't had the need to contact them at all since well I had no issues so I cant speak for there customer service.<//review>

Difficult location for velocitier to service but they tried and failed.
Poor follow up when they charge a $65 fee to drive out to fix their own problem.
Endless reboots yields only marginally improved download speed for only a few hours.
Can’t wait to come to end of contract do I can work with someone else.</Review>

When I lost my service with Clearwire, I contacted every provider in the area. Most of them came out and gave a quick shot and said they could not help me. The Velociter rep, I believe his name is Andrew, went the extra mile to get service to me. He was determined to find a spot that would work. There were a few adjustments that had to be made after the foliage came on in the spring, but he was right there to get it done. I highly recommend Velociter. Their service has been outstanding.< /Text>

<Review>I've been a using this service  for the past  6 years. Over this last year my speed and connect has gradually  been Getting worse. I finally  had enough  and decided  to call the last week to see what could be done. I called them on Tuesday Nov 20th and spoke to a woman  who informed  they needed to upgrade my equipment  and it would cost  me $45 dollars or they would do it for free if I signed a 2 year contract.  Let me just say I'm glad I didn't  sign the 2 year contract. She also  told me it would only  take a hour to change  out the equipment  and as soon as they do that they could change my plan. Well once there technician  show up on Wednesday  Nov 21st it took him 2 hours just to change  out the dish and put on a longer pole. After he left I call velociter to upgrade my account  to be informed that she left work early  for the holiday. Okay I can understand  that, no big deal. He then tells that he would  take my information  and have her  call me Monday. Okay that sounds good. The following  Monday  no call. So I call Tuesday  thinking  maybe she forgot.  I was then informed  by the same man that she is at  a seminar  and she will be gone the next two days. He proceeds to tell me that  he will give  her a call and see if there is anything  they can do. Three hours go by with no phone call. Wednesday no call. Thursday no call. It is now Friday Nov 30. I called them again at 9:52a.m. and I got the same guy yet again  who informed  me that that she is very busy  and calling  back  customers and he is sure that I'm on her list of people  to call today. It is now 3:54p.m. as I write this and I've yet to receive a call. They better fix my internet today, because  if they don't and I see a bill tomorrow  for $120 for a service  that I physically can not use there will be a serious problem.  If you need internet  for recreation and more importantly  for work like I do. I highly  suggest  you look elsewhere.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Velociter used to be good. I made a review about them three years ago about how the service wasn't reliable. Nothing seems to have changed. There's always service interruptions, and how many weeks does it take to do hardware updates?

I think they've bitten off more than they can chew.</review>

< Review>
Their excuse, no matter which tower you are located at, is that there are too many people using that tower than what it was built for. When asked what they will do about it, they will claim that they have an upgrade sometime soon, which will keep getting pushed back more and more if you ask about it. This is true for me, and two of my friends who are, without a doubt, on different towers. All of us got the same response.< /Review>

Have been using Velociter for 2 years and have no complaints! There "down time" (in my experience) has blown away both ATT and xFinity. I don't get the some of these bad reviews about customer service,, they are quick and professional... i dont know what more i would expect from them, they are great!</review>

<text>Velociter Wireless provided our service when my family was living in a rural area. They assured me that moving isn't a problem with the contract. When my family moved into town, (3 blocks from the Velociter Wireless office) they sent 2 technicians over to "study" my new house. They told me that I couldn't get a signal and then they left. They didn't try to see if there were options for us, nor did they plan to re-test. I went to the office to speak with Scott Vander Dussen, the owner, and he was rude and insistent that I pay out my contract. As a single mom, paying for an internet connection that I cannot receive for 8 months is impossible! I cannot believe how rude they were and their unwillingness to find a solution is disappointing. I do not recommend this company.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I pay $69.95 per month for what is advertised as 10 MBS speed.  Velociter Wireless is utterly unreliable.  When I'm home, if my internet is working (if), I'm getting speeds under 4 MBpS.  So flipping slow.  5G please hurry.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) velociter wireles it hurts that I am still under contract but I just finished and shit with your service in de lo peror this service I do not only recommend it if I thought that by doing my 2.0 to 10.0 package I would be happy but the only thing that happened to me was the cobbo from 49.95 to 69.95 because it is not necessary to switch off because one does not want to pay as a good payer but one day there will be a demand for bad service They DO NOT GET IN PROBLEMS WITH THIS COMPANY IT DOESN'T SERVE AS PROMISE AND ALSO THE GREATEST TIME FAILS AND IS SUPER SLOW

(Original)
velociter wireles lastima que tengo aun estoy bajo contrato pero nomas termine y ala mierda con su servicio en de lo peror este servicio no selo recomiendo anadie sen yo pense que suviendo mi paquete de 2.0 a 10.0 estaria feliz pero lo unico que me suvieron fue el cobbo de 49.95 a 69.95 pues nimodo apagar yaque  uno ya que como buen pagador  auque no quiera pero un dia se presentara una demanda x mal sevicio  NO SE METAN EN PROBLEMAS CON ESTA COMPANIA NO SIRVE COMO PROMETEN Y ADEMAS LA MAYOR PARTE DE TIEMPO FALLA Y ESTA SUPER LENTO</Review>

Inquired about dolls up at front counter they have listed for more then a new fully unopened package. Packages was clearly opened and thrown back together.... maybe reprice those items in future ..... It's a second hand store. Other then that it's a good place usually.<//text>

<review>Excellent selection, friendly staff, good inventory turnover. I particularly like the fact that there are additional discounts based on the color of price tags. These are fairly good, for instance on a given Saturday, the yellow tagged items could be further discounted by 50%, whereas on some other day it could be the blue tagged ones. I have found everything from clothes, shoes and fashion accessories to home decor, kitchen appliances and housewares.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I enjoy going to Good Will on a regular basis. This location has some convenient off-street parking, which is nice in Pacific Grove/New Monterey. The selection of clothes is very good, but they lack in the household goods section. (I think they call it brick-a-brack.) The prices are a little bit high for my experience with other Good Will stores, but that could just be my perception. Perhaps all thrift stores are raising their prices. Either way, this one is worth a stop if you're in the are.<//review>

I'm used to Goodwills having a little more space and organization. There were lots of brand new Halloween things for sale, which was a little weird.</review>< date>

<text>I love Goodwills but the one in Monterey seems to discriminate....I've never written a review publicly because I'm to respectful of others but I feel strongly about how shameful they (even the leadership) is trained in handling someone with a disability- i thought goodwills were suppose to help people and community but Monterey goodwill puts that thought to shame...I was horribly embarrassed the other day and the manager didn't seem to care one way or the other if his staff was behaving rudely towards their customers....I feel publicly strongly enough to tell and to have a voice to share to those in wheelchairs to beware of the Monterey goodwill and how it rudely discriminates ...I asked for the managers name which is Andrew M. Since he would not come out of his little office in the back to speak to me about my concerns And I will be calling goodwill headquarters and follow up in writing about how I was discriminated against by Andrew M. And his staff....in addition i will be filing a claim with the City of Monterey against Andrew M. and a claim with the civil liberties folks...this is in hopes they will treat those with disabilities much better and that others have a better experience then I did....thank you to those who read and listened to my concerns (I gave one star as that was a requirement in order to post my comments - but in actuality they should receive no gold stars and an F in customer service due to their discrimination against those with disabilities)<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Told us every artist had a different pricing, didn’t hive us any type or price till after our tattoo was finished, 3 little lines less then an inch big. Cost us each $120 dollars. Never come here unless you’d like to be ripped off and not given any information until after it’s time to pay. Worst experience of my life.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80e84d4739e38c3f:0xb16422888c0055f8</GmapID></record>

Phil is amazing! His prices are fair, he’s very clean and professional! I never feel rushed but he also doesn’t waste any of our time. I’ve gotten several tattoos from him and will be going back for more<//Text>

Visiting the area from out of town and walked in hoping we could get tattoos.  We knew we were taking a chance, but went in anyway.  My husband and I both left with amazing pieces.  Thank you, Johnny for the flag and Cristina for the berries and bee.  Have recommended to friends and will make the drive back for our next tattoos.  My husband and I both highly recommend!< /text>

<review>I got my tattoo done by Phillip and he was amazing! He made me feel comfortable and welcome and he has great attention to detail and has a passion for what he does. The shop was very clean and everyone there seemed very nice and would go back and recommend it to everyone who is getting tattoos or piercings.</review>< pics>

<text>Went to famous tattoo for a cartilage piercing as I had been hearing good things about the shop and thought I would give them a try. Johnny was nice and welcoming and super knowledgeable! I really appreciated the education and commitment to safe piercings that heal properly. He was polite and answered my many questions, much appreciated and recommend highly! the shop was a little slow in getting to me but I didn’t make an appointment so it was to be expected.</text></record></dataset><record>

I was on my way home from a week trip and I had taken my nose ring out. They were kind and courteous, got me in and our quickly. Since he was redoing an existing hole he only charged for the jewelry and it made my day. Clean and nice inside the shop, just wish I would have tipped him more 😂< /text>

Was introduced to Bobby via Instagram. He was quick with booking, super detailed and listened to exactly what I wanted out of a tattoo! Prices are extremely reasonable. The atmosphere of the shop is so cool, everyone is super friendly! Bobby did some amazing work on myself and a friend. I highly recommend him. Takes his time, and makes sure you're as comfortable as possible. Would definitely go back to see him.</Text>

This is a very cool place.  It’s clean, relaxed and folks here are helpful and friendly.  Came in for a nose piercing and an additional piercing in each ear.  Stinged a bit, but Johnny was awesome about it all.  He made me feel comfortable.  I will def be coming back 👍</Review>

<review>Long story short, I went in to get my septum pierced and the lady with the long orange hair messed up and placed it too high up in my nose. I called the owner and he let me come in and get it re-pierced by someone else. I'm happy with the results now.< /review>< Pictures>

The atmosphere was great. But fiancee and I got a septum piercing and his came out pretty good. Slightly crooked but not too bad. Mine on the other hand came out really badly and super noticeably crooked. I'm very upset cause it was a piercing I've wanted for a very long time. Plus side though didnt really hurt for me. Going back in soon to get it fixed.<//Review>

Worst customer service ever. I went in to have a piece of jewelry I bought in Santa Barbara placed and felt so uncomfortable during my interactions. It was like they were pained to be interacting with me. The piercer thought he knew everything (that my piercing closed up- it’s been 13 years, and the jewelry was too big for my hole- it fit up until this morning when I knocked it out by playing with it.) and then was told it would be 20 bucks. That was the tipping point- I walked out. No one smiled or was nice in anyway. Plus the shop is dirty. Avoid.<//Review>

Famous tattoos is full of brilliant talented artists who will get the job done and leave u with a  beautiful piece of work on your body.
I have not been tattooed by all of the artists there but im sure the others are just as or if not better than john and alma who have done my tattoos everytime i go in.
im proud of the work they have done on me and couldnt have chosen a better place to go get my tattoos at
I highly recommend this place to anybody whos in the area looking for a shop and for quality pieces of work to be done.</text>

I went in to get my ear pierced (tregus) I like my piercing and everything is good so far. The place was clean (except for a little bit of ants) and the people were very nice however, I couldn’t give 5 stars due to a couple of reasons. 1. I paid $90 and that was after a $10 vip discount, so it would’ve been $100. I don’t mind paying for quality but I think $100 for one ear piercing is still a bit pricey ( just my opinion). 2. There was zero earring selection!!! All they had was the metal ball and you can either get it in stainless steel or titanium (for $20 extra) this was a huge bummer for me but I was already sitting and prepped for piercing so I just said whatever, and went with it. Aftercare instructions were somewhat vague but this wasn’t an issue for me as I do have some experience caring for piercings. Also, no cleaning solution was provided. From my experience you always get a cleaning solution, either complimentary or it’s included in the price of the piercing (especially if the prices are high). All in all it wasn’t a bad experience so I did give a tip.</text>

I spoke to one of the artist about getting some piercings done and was told that they would be contacting me about a time. I waited a week and decided to contact them and ended up getting no reply. I ended up having to reach out again and was told a time. A few minutes before my appointment I texted again to verify and was told “she was feeling under the weather”. Honestly find another shop. Very very unprofessional and a waist of time.< /review>

I had arrived very close to closing to find out their piercer had left only a few minutes before. The staff made the effort to call and get him back. Despite leaving for personal issues, he came all the way back after hearing about our long drive. Great prices Monday-Wednesday only paid $30 which included jewelry. I was quoted anywhere from $60-80 at other places. Piercer was very professional, joked with me after i expressed my anxiety, and gave me a pack of Oreos after because i was feeling a bit dizzy. The piercing is straight, only a small pinch, walked me through the steps of what he was doing, and it is healing well! I will definitely be returning!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Service was outstanding!!!!
I’m a new customer who had all my questions and concerns answered.  Staff (Karen first then Luis)  went above and beyond!!! 👍☺️  Luis stayed ‘till the store closed to make sure my connection and transfer of service went through.  This was the BEST service ever! I highly recommend using AT&T and coming in to their corporate store!< /Text>

<text>The guys at the store displayed great service. I was helped within a few seconds of entering the store, then helped find an old receipt from a product I purchased a few months ago. Very sanitary and seemed to care about how I was genuinely doing. Encouraged me to stay safe and enjoy my week! It was great!<//text></record>

Louis went above and beyond to ensure I got my phone set up and activated. I was in and out within 20-30 mins. Will defiantly be back when I make future purchases. He turned a bad experience into excellent. I recommend this location. The store manager was wonderful as well. Nothing but high remarks for this store! All professional and friendly.

Great customer service. Gerardo made our experience so easy. He had so much patience with us considering the last time we upgraded our phone was six years ago.</Review>

<text>Went 2 days ago to the AT&T store on 1060 E Harriman Pl in San Bernardino. The store open right on time, was clean and with friendly staff. I was assisted by Karen Cisneros, Karen was cordial, friendly and very knowledgeable.  Karen made my visit to the store very pleasant and I felt that I got answers to all my questions, she took her time explaining to me most of the features of the new phone I got. I am not use to writing a review but I think Karen and the store deserves it, I was trying to upgrade my phone online just to avoid going to the store, and due to delivery issues I wasn’t able to do it. I am glad on chosen to set up my appointment on this specific store because I got the helped I needed.< /text><username>Luvia Rodriguez<//username>< pics>

Super helpful pre coivd 19, I don't live near my elderly parents so new phones are always a hassle when I am not there. Not anymore,  my mother calls me FaceTime and I talk to Lovey I believe was her name. Customer service outstanding she was able to help my mother and me with patience I do not have. My mother even returned a few times after with my father to get help understanding newer technologies. Super grateful for the care they took with my parents.< /Review>

<Review>So incredibly happy with my experience here. Gerardo was so wonderful and helped me with exactly what I went in for. The entire staff working tonight were so incredibly kind and helpful. I was in and out with my brand new phone in hand. Thank you for answering all of my questions and explaining everything so thoroughly and patiently as well as making the experience so stress free, which is more than I could say about my previous experience at a store nearby.

Originally I started at the Redlands location, but had such a disappointing experience with one of their team members, Vanity. My goodness, get ready for the upsell and the most uncomfortable experience of your life. At one point I became so uncomfortable I thanked her for her time and attempted to leave and she told me, "good luck then, I'll definitely see you later to fix everything the other store will mess up for you, you'll be back." I had to politely smile and walk out. She even went as far as trying to get me to add an additional line I'd have zero use for that I didn't even need and saying "why not just do it for the free phone and just keep it somewhere." Huh? I was so confused and my fiance was just ready to leave and the persistence was overwhelming. I completely understand trying to make a sale, but my goodness, whoever trained this poor girl needs a lesson in boundaries. No means no honey. Worst part, that was in 15 minutes of being there.

Steer clear everyone ;)<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I absolutely love Results Transformation Center. I started out doing a Six Week Challenge and was hooked. I’ve been a member for five years now and look forward to my gym time. The coaches and staff are very supportive and encouraging. They have created an environment that makes everyone feel comfortable no matter your fitness level or age. They can modify any move until you get stronger. As I face reality that I’m not a spring chicken anymore, I know that I need to exercise regularly to physically feel better. My inflammation has completely disappeared since I’ve began Results. It’s the best decision I made and I totally recommend this gym to anyone.< /Text>< username>

I would totally recommend Result transformation it's not your average gym .The environment is friendly, as an your not just buddy someone you know but new faces are always cheered and welcomed every class .Coaches always on move during class helping correcting form and pushing. Care Coaches help with any questions related nutrition and stretching. I recommend you'll to give a try drop in for class .</Text>

Sometimes it's about the journey, not the destination that matters. The last 6 weeks, I have gotten back to eating healthy, working out almost every morning, finding a protein drink I actually love (they really do exist!), and building a community of support for my health goals. Most importantly, I am celebrating and laughing at myself (No, Marcia, your hips need to go backwards!) as I realize my real goal was  to find a place where I would be encouraged every day to keep trying. Thanks to my coaches and friends I have made, this is only the beginning. Great workouts, great people, and great Fit Fam! Thanks, Results!!</text>

<text>I can honestly say this is the best gym I've ever been to. I've tried 24 hour, cross fit, Orange Theory, and Results in the past. Results is the one I keep coming back to. There is no gym like it! The fit fam you become part of immediately and the encouragement from coaches and staff are endless. They make it a point to have you feel part of the team.
The workouts are always challenging, always different, never boring, and super fun! It helps that the coaches walk around and truly watch every member to make sure they are using proper form. Oh and they will always give you an alternative move if you have limits or mobility issues. They really do care about their members! That's why I feel Results is the BEST gym out there!!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1578414152704, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to leave us such great feedback, April.

I never knew I would enjoy a 5am workout so much! I used to oversleep for work now I get up at 4am to workout. This was one of the best decisions I made for myself and my family. I have gained energy, endurance, and feel great! It has been a pleasure to work with such knowledgeable, friendly and no nonsense people. All of the coaches truly care that you in the group of 40-50 people are getting your best work out so you can get the best benefit. I have truly enjoyed this experience! Thank you so much Results Sunrise!<//Text>

< Review>
I just completed my 6 week 20lb challenge and beat it by losing 21.4lbs! So happy with my victory I joined as a member immediately after with no question. This is not your typical gym, which I've tried them all, it's a new lifestyle support system. I always struggled being motivated in continuously going to the gym. The initial investment was a great incentive to try get back and basically get 6 weeks of training, meal planning and support for free! Yes concur the challenge and get all your money back. I ended up getting the 6 weeks for free and now have become a member because it is worth every penny. The coaches are the best, they are very attentive to challengers and members. The challengers and members themselves are all so positive and encourage each other. Everyone eventually gets to know one another over time because we all have the same purpose. This is a place to get results, that no other gym will give you. I've seen all the challengers and myself get stronger and skinnier within the last 6 weeks. I'm extremely happy to continue my journey to get even stronger and leaner. Good luck to you and you won't regret joining, it just might be the best investment for yourself.<//Review>

I took the challenge and All I can say is that is been  the best decision I have ever made.  I have been to different gyms but felt lost and like I  didn't fit in, no one guides you or calls you and give you the extra push you need to achieve your goals.  But Results Transformation Center  is all and beyond what  everyone says and what I was expecting. I am so glad I found them and now belong to this gym and the fit fam. The support you get from them is incredible.  If you have try everything and nothing worked like I did, try them and see yourself transform into someone new.< /Text>

<user_name>marico kathane<//user_name><review>Round 2 :
I lost a total of 6 lbs this challenge. I was not able to make my 20 lbs but I have gained lot of confidence and have become very strong. I have toned down my body and have lost lot of inches. I have lot of non scale victories like I am able to fit better in my old clothes which were just lying in my closet as they had stopped fitting me. I can walk run now. I can lift very heavy and workout all 7 days without getting tired. I am definitely going to be a member of results as results have really made all that money and effort worth it.

Round1
This is the best gym I have ever seen. The coaches are super friendly and they always push you to do your best. They understand and are always ready to answer any questions. Everyday the only thing I look forward to is going to the gym at 4.30 pm, and then wait again for the next day. Its super fun with a lot of high intensity exercises. They make you do things you never thought you'll ever be able to do.
Thanks results team for making it possible for me to lose 20.4 lbs in 6 weeks. I am totally in it and all ready to lose another 20 and get fitter each and every day.

<review>Awesome gym.. I did the 6 week challenge and lost 21.2 lbs. So happy with my results. All the coaches are great but my favorite is coach Curtis. No excuses is his approach and I'm doing moves I never thought I would be able to do.
This is where they failed.
After my challenge I was given an option to become a member which I would love to become, but It wasn't the offer that my sister was given after her challenge she had just completed. I was told that if I lost 20 lbs my payment would roll over to pay the monthly installments of 99 per month. Hopefully they will be able to offer me the same as my sister received.</review>< Pics>

<review>When I walked into Results Transformation Sunrise I had no idea what to expect. I was greeted by Coach Will with a high five and a great, energetic attitude. That scared me even more! The first workout was HARD, as was every workout after that. However, as I went in each day, dreading it when I left work, when I walked in to workout I remembered I was with friends and the staff made it feel like home.

Coach Will, Coach Curtis, Coach Randy and Coach John kicked my butt every single day, but it was worth every second. I also knew they were doing something right because I felt like I was going to die. Results Transformation Sunrise it's hands down THE BEST gym I've ever been to. (I've gone to a lot) and this will be the ONLY gym I will ever go to again. This gym, and these people make me feel better than I've ever felt.</review><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Results Transformation Center has some of the best personal trainers that I have come in contact with. Even throughout my military career I have not come across anyone in fitness as motivating as the coaches at Results. I think the quality of the gym is good and the workouts are great and never boring. You will see results as long as you stay consistent and stick to the plan they have designed for you. Results is awesome and I would recommend Results to friends and family and in fact I already have and I hope to see some of them in the gym with me soon.< /Text>

My wife asked me to accompany her to an orientation for Results. As I sat and listened to Matt talk, I knew it was time for change. All my questions were answered and I signed on the dotted line. I really had no idea what I was in store for but figured I didn't have anything to lose.

What I found when I walked into Results was an extremely attentive group of coaches. I explained to them the limitations I had with my lower back and not only did they take the time to show me different modifications they helped show me how to stretch and target my problem areas.

As I got stronger my daily workouts were modified specifically for me. Heavier weights were added and my coaches always made sure I was pushing myself hard in order to obtain the goals I had set.  When I had questions about meal planing my coach was never farther than an email away.

I am extremely happy with my journey at Results. Because of their program and my hard work I completed my challenge successfully. Yes, I could take my money and run but instead I signed up as a member. This program works!<//Text>

<Text>I joined this gym January 11, 2016.  Nervous, energized and curious.  Today I finished a 6 week challenge and the journey to my weight loss was incredible! I lost 22.2 pounds!
The coaches at Sunrise are fantastic. They teach, push, motivate, assist and coach.  The group exercise classes are incredible.  Not only do they give us exercises in a way that is fun, hard, and self challenging, but you get split up into smaller groups, and we cheer each other on to completion.  The nutrition was easy to follow. They give you a complete list, and just stick to it!  They say Nutrition is 70-80% success for a weight loss program, and I believe it to be true, but the work outs are body changing.  Modifications are available for any fitness level.  When my challenge came to an end, I went to the supermarket to get good, and found myself only buying things off the list.  This was and is a life changing event, which I encourage EVERYONE to participate in!</Text>< userid>

The atmosphere of the gym is unlike anything I have experienced in the past. The coaches, Will, Curtis, Stacey, John and Randy are the best! I took a 6 week challenge and was able to lose 26lbs in that time and honestly love going to the gym and seeing all of the positive and upbeat members each day. The results are real. You just have to put in the work.< /text>

<Text>I was reluctant to try results gym and thought everyone would be in great shape while i was a work in progress.  This was the best choice I've made for my fitness goals.  The coaches are helpful and encouraging, the other challengers are in the same boat and working hard while encouraging others.  Everyone is friendly and helpful, there is no way i could have done this without their support.  Results is the best investment you can make in your health and fitness.</Text>< pictures>

I just completed my second 6 week challenge with Results Transformation Center at the Sunrise location and what can I say:  Another 20 lbs and overall, in thirteen weeks, close to 55 lbs.  I started at an extremely ugly 265 fat, lousy, pounds and now I am pushing 210.  My goal is 190 but I'm pretty sure I should be able to continue on to maybe 180!

I have to be honest, it was a struggle, this last challenge.  The weight was not coming off as fast as the first challenge, which I guess is to be expected, but....who the f^^k cares, I did it, and with that said, even turned my success into a membership for the next year.  This is the best deal -- if you don't mind the coaches (Lea, John, Curtis, Aj, Consuela and the rest) yelling at you, motivating you, pushing you to do things that you haven't done in a very long time.

And we (members, challengers) all share pretty much of same goals, have fun, sweat, and look better.  Thank God, Costco's got cheap pants, because, it looks like I'll be downsizing a bit during this next year.  I started wearing a size 40 stretch pants with no belt -- now 38's are too lose with the belt tightened all the way.

As far as the menu goes, the food is what it is -- better for me.  Turkey, lean beef, fish, veggies all the way, protein shakes and the works, and I'm never hungry.

Who knows how far I'll go, but I do have a few goals -- 1) Matt, if ever need a speaker at one of your presentations, I'm volunteering, and 2) I want my beast mode, and 3) my picture on the wall at Sunrise!

Finally -- To all at Sunrise, Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!</Text>

It is my absolute pleasure to write my testimonial for Results!  I will freely admit that I was skeptical about their claims of loosing 20 lbs in 6 weeks.  Sure, young people could do it, but I am 45 and everything I’ve read says it’s so hard to lose weight after 40.  However, I was exhausted all the time, my clothes didn’t fit, and my blood pressure was rising higher and higher.  I figured “what the heck, anything is better than what I was doing,” and the 42 days was going to pass by whether I chose to help my self or not.  So I bit the bullet and signed up.

In the beginning I was so uncoordinated and nervous, but now I’m able to hold a plank, do many push-ups in a row, and I generally feel great!  Learning to eat according to the plan was challenging at first, but I found that my will is stronger than my stomach and after a week or so it was easy to stick to the food plan (STTFP).  Plus, everyone was so friendly at the gym that I was happy and excited to go everyday.

Thanks to the amazing coaches at Results and the plan they have put together, anyone can succeed if they just follow the simple directions.  This program has changed my life.  Give it a chance to change your life too.< /text>

I signed up in 2019 and I completed the 6 week challenge . I didn’t win the money because I only lost 11 lbs which was a lot of weight to loose , but the catch is you have to have a lot of fat to loose (no offense). I was really happy with my results I decided to sign up for a contract , which was $777 for 7 months . This was great at the time because I enjoyed the staff , facility and workouts . Soon I realized this gym is meant for people who work 9-5 or unemployed people. Not meant for college students who have inconsistent schedules . My issue was trying to get there at the times they have their classes I believe their first class was 5:00am and last was 9 or 10 . Then no classes til 5:00pm. I am still a full time student plus work 25+ hours a week. Once school started I had no time due to early classes and late night shifts . I was disappointed in myself for paying a contract that I couldn’t fully complete . That was my lost . The issue began once I noticed they had been charging my card after the contract was over . My contract was suppose to be over December 2019. They continued to take payments Jan, feb and March. I called to talk to Will to fix that . He explained that i supposedly agreed to a renewal after my contract , which I did not . He tells me he will take March off and not the other months . Mind you this is $135 they are taking a month. He sends me my copy of my contract for me to only find out he illegally added the renewal with out my consent . Meaning when I signed up I signed the document on the initial agreement and then he slipped in the renewal. Make sure you are aware and you don’t get scammed because I thought they cared about me and hr shortly showed me that all they care about is the money and how to get over on you . This place is good if u need a personal trainer , but that’s it . It’s not a gym with a bunch of equipment that is easy to use on your own time . You might as well workout at home .</Review>< pics>

I enjoyed the atmosphere at the gym, the coaches, and the members. Everyone was great! I can say that I have learned a lot through the process as far as diet and exercise. I have stayed on as a member because I enjoy the workouts so much. They kick my butt every time I show up. I would recommend Results to anyone who is looking for a change in themselves. Regardless of whether or not you need to loose a lot of weight or if you are just looking for a place to workout, meet great people and become more physically fit! So happy I signed up and can't wait to get to my goal! I know I will with the help of Results!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I am someone who REALLY, really likes to research things before I do them.  Results was no different.  I went to two orientations prior to enrolling, and my only regret is that I didn't sign up sooner.  I hesitated time and time again, but eventually it became clear that nothing else was working--it was time to do it, and I am so beyond glad that I did.  Let me clarify, I am not one of those people who looooves eating healthy and can't wait to go to the gym.  I am more of a skip on my way to the fridge type of girl and call it a day.  Results, however, is changing all of that.  I am beginning to see food as fuel, not as an emotional crutch.  My favorite part of the program is the workouts.  They are HARD, but I love it.  One of the best parts of the workouts is that I have NEVER, ever felt anything close to judged.  It is regular to give each other high fives, hear words of encouragement from teammates, and get cheered on by your coaches.  I lost 23 lbs during my first 6 week challenge.  I am beginning my second, and am so happy to have found Results.</Text><user>104933519472080734390</user><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Kelly Sarah</user_name>< rating>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I just can't say enough about Results Transformation Center. Thanks to the coaches, I have lost a total of 37.6 pounds in the two challenges that I participated in. I have also gone from a size 14 to a size 8. And most important, I feel stronger and healthier than I have in a long time. They have helped me gain my confidence back.

It's not just the coaches; it is everyone at the gym. The entire fit fam is so supportive and non-judgmental; I couldn't see myself going anywhere else.

It's hard work, but it is so worth the Results! I recommend this gym to anyone who is looking for a place to fit in, who wants support and advice from real coaches, and who just is looking to change their lives.

I checked out other gyms, but none of them had the same feel that Results does. It truly is an amazing gym!<//text>< Pictures>

I just completed my Final weigh in and lost a total of 32 Lbs!! My BMI and body fat % were fantastic as well! After the 1st workout I wanted out after 3 knee surgeries and heading towards knee replacement I thought there's no way my knees are going to hold up, I talked to Coach Curtis the following workout and he modified my workouts perfectly to match my body, I was Red Lighted on shoulders as well and the modifications were perfect, I have much more mobility in my knees and shoulders than I've had in years and my Energy Level is through the roof, I can't give enough props to the entire Results Crew, they were all accessible and helpful every step of the way, look forward to a great boating season where I won't be embarrassed to take off my shirt!.

100% recommend this gym for anyone who is committed to get RESULTS. The workouts have modifications available so any level can benefit. The diet is easy to understand and follow. As long as you make your workouts and STTFP you WILL succeed! The coaches are supportive and helpful, encouraging every step of the way, I never once just felt like a member, I felt like part of the RESULTS FAMILY.

Results Transformation Center is the best place to transform yourself. The coaches are motivating and the workouts are challenging, fun, and energizing. After working out and sticking to the meal plan, I feel stronger, healthier, and have learned self discipline to accomplish the goals I set for myself. I truly feel grateful for the Results team at the Sunrise location for all the support and motivation to help me make these lifestyle changes and stick with them.  Thank you!<//text>

<text>I had reached a stand still in my weight loss journey before doing the Results 6 week 20 lb challenge. The coaches here are absolutely phenomenal they make you feel like they are  your personal trainer, they got me so excited to come in 5 days a week to exercise that I actually would have wanted to come in seven days a week except for I know my body needs to rest. They pushed me to always do my best and to work towards getting even stronger.  I am a returning Challenger going into round 2 since I lost 27.4 pounds in my first round! I can't say for sure that I would ever have lost that much weight in 6 weeks on my own without the help of results Transformation Center!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Awesome!!
I'm an alumni challenger who came from the Arden/Howe gym. While I was a tad bit skeptical and loyal to my original "home gym," this place kicks ass!!! They are uber professional and require that you bring your game in a healthy way. They challenge you while being careful that every exercise is being executed correctly. There's a great balance going on here and I'm grateful to have found such an awesome place to work out. One hour a day and the results you get?? Priceless!! Good job team Sunrise!< /text>

<text>I'm happy to say that I completed the six week challenge and lost 20.6 lbs.  It was definitely hard but worth it.  It's not just about the weight loss.  Sure that's a huge factor but for me it's also about the people you meet there and the strength you gain both inside and out.  You really can push yourself more than you think.  The coaches are so nice at Sunrise and they help motivate you.  Thats what I needed.  So I'm on to my next challenge.  :)< /text>< Pics>

<text>After completing 4 rounds of the 6 Week Challenge, I guess I should be sick of the program, but I’m far from it!  Even after losing 69.2 lbs since January, I still have goals to reach, and I know that the only place in town that will get me there is Results.  I love the trainers and the program is easy to follow.  Anyone that needs a kick start should come here.  I am looking forward to this next phase as a member, and to helping new challengers coming in.  We are a fit family here, and I’m in it for the long haul.  I recommend this program to anyone because anyone can achieve success for whatever their specific goals are.  I only wish I had joined sooner!< /text>< pics>

Completed my first 6 week challenge and lost 20lbs! If you are looking for accountability, this is the place! Tons of motivation from all the Sunrise coaches and especially all those who are in the challenge with you and can relate! The people are great! Different levels, you do your best, your results are stronger and better<//Review>

I am very proud to say that I successfully completed the first 6 week challenge with a loss of 23.6 lbs. I will be going on the second 6 weeks. I had a rough start in the first couple weeks because I didn't (STTFP) but once I did the weight started to come off fast. The coaches are awesome at Sunrise Results Transformation Center. On my first day I thought I was going to die from the exercise and I almost wanted to give up, but the coaches and few others that i was working out with kept saying you can do it!!! So I kept pushing and I kept going day after day and then I started to see changes in my body, My aches and pains from the weight I was carrying started to go away. I was able to fit into a few pair of my old jeans that had been in my closet for years... I am now able to bend over and tie my shoes without any problem. I have more energy than I have had in years. I can honestly say that starting the challenge is the best decision I have made for 2016 and I plan to lose even more in the second round. Results Transformation Center is definitely the place to be!!!< /review>

Results Transformation Center is an awesome gym. The coaches are very supportive and the workouts are a challenge, as they should be. I was skeptical at first but after losing 5 lbs during my first week I was convinced. At the end of my challenge I lost a total of 20 lbs. I couldn't be more proud of myself. Thank you to all the coaches for their words of encouragement and support! Results has been that push I needed towards a healthier lifestyle.<//review>

Results was exactly what I needed to get my weight loss jump started. I had been trying on my own with not much progress. I completed the 20 lb challenge and I’m so glad I did, I dropped 21.8 lbs a few months before my wedding. (I went from 168.6 to 146.8) The eating was definitely the hardest part, but committing to the challenge was the motivation I needed to just do it and stop making excuses. The workouts were great and the trainers are so positive and supportive, but they also know when to tell you to pick up the pace and challenge you to push yourself. Believe it or not I did enjoy going there and met a lot of good people during my 6 weeks.<//text>

My weight loss journey accelerated when I committed to the 6 week challenge. The support from the staff and the group workout sessions has inspired me to experience real transformation beyond the challenge. I am now a member and I'm living a lifestyle of transformation. Results has given me the tools I need to be successful.</Review>

<text>My experience at Results Transformation Center Sunrise was incredible. I came in to this 6 week challenge in a horrible state. I had not really exercised in 8 years due to injuries and complications from 2 head-on collisions in 5 years. Once I had my doctor's ok to exercise (with modifications), I decided I should go all out to get back in the game. What I love about Results is they work with you as an individual. They can modify your workout so that you get the most out of it without hurting yourself. This was one of my big issues. My worries were quickly relieved when I was given a thorough screening. I am now doing things I never, ever imagined I would do! This has been a life changing experience and I am so grateful!< /text>< pictures>

Results is not just the place that has helped me to lose weight, it is my home, my sanctuary. I realize more and more with each day and each empowering workout how much Results has impacted my life in a positive way. I feel better about my body's abilities as well as my physical appearance. I feel welcomed by the coaches and staff every time I walk in, and by the other members or challengers who I meet, that understand what I'm going through more than anyone else in some ways. When I have had a lousy day and all I want to do is go home and get in to bed to forget about it, I choose instead to go to Results where it never fails to put a smile on my face by the time I leave. Almost every day I am there I realize new strengths or push myself to new limits. I think everyone needs to experience it in the life-changing way that I did, but you will never know unless you give Results a chance, and also believe in yourself!! If you are tired of the habits you have formed in your daily life, or the clothes that you keep saving but can never lose weight to fit in to, then you NEED to come to Results; it will be the best decision you ever made!!!<//Text>

<review>I just finished my second challenge and have lost 44 pounds total. After 12 weeks, I am getting my money back and putting it right back into a membership at Results. I am in the best shape i've been in since playing lacrosse in college, all my old clothes from college fit, and I am confident and happy. I look forward to every workout and to getting stronger with the help of the coaches at Results. I was skeptical to start and after I finished my first challenge my mind was changed, but I didn't think I would be able to make the second challenge. I was able to push myself and be pushed by the coaches and others at the gym and succeeded beyond what I could have imagined. This is a 5 star program that will change your life if you put the work in and let it.< /review>< Time>

Very bad experience trying to cancel membership! Read the fine print people! They verbal say one thing and then when you try to cancel they reference the "terms and conditions you signed"!! Now I am STILL being billed from a credit bureau!!! COMPLETE bait and switch!!! Very unethical! If you are considering, my recommendation is to request everything they say IN WRITING!!< /Review>

Results transformation centers are life savers, I'm done being lazy couch potato and they helped me snap back into the best me possible. I'm going into my second challenge and will most likely do a third. I really needed to kick myself into gear but didn't have the right motivation until I came across them via Facebook Ad in September. I'm so glad I attended the initial orientation, they motivate you to get the results you both strive for.
I am running the Philadelphia marathon in November and needed to start working out again to get prepared while also running 5/10K's events. I have done (2) 5K's this challenge and I'm right on track thanks to Results Transformation Center's. I've created a year calendar on my Mac that has all races until 2017, I'm making goals and turning them into actual plans!
The best part is they do it in a timely manner.  6 weeks to lose 20lbs? Yes please! I've been holding on to this extra weight the past two years and it is time to get rid of it for good.The plan they have really makes the weight come right off, STICK TO THE PLAN!
I tell all my friends and family about this place, they ask me and I love talking about it! It's my favorite place to go to in the mornings, it truly energizes me for my day. I can't image starting my day without working out. The staff is amazing, I love the workouts. The atmosphere is welcoming and inspiring, the coaches are great. You are forced to create healthy habits for yourself, I couldn't be more happy with my results... on to the next one!< /text>

I just completed my second 6wk challenge with Results with a total weight loss of 41.2 lbs.  I am so glad  I made the decision to invest in myself and would do it again any day of the week.  I worked my butt off, and there were times I felt like giving up but the support and encouragement from the coaches and the rest of the "transformers" is what kept me join til the end.  If you're concerned about the cost, don't be - you're worth it! !</text>

I first heard about Results through a coworker. I noticed she was looking amazing and her confidence level was crazy high. My sister went to an orientation and I heard about expensive it was and thought no way could I afford that. I thought about it for weeks and weeks. I have never really struggled with my weight. I have always been lucky enough to stay active and eat whatever I wanted. It was until I had a deep loss within my family, my brother passed away suddenly, and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, that made me go into a depression and use food as a comfort. I was drinking alcohol all the time and eating whatever I could get my hands on to make me forget about reality. I gained over 60lbs in just a short time. I stopped going out, stopped doing the things I loved. I had such a fake confidence that no one even believed me when I self I was very self-conscious.  I was really good at faking the smile. I remembered all of this and started telling myself this is not how my brother would want me to live my life. He would be so mad at me if he was here. So now for the happy part. I decided to work overtime at my job and sign up for Results with my sister. She went to an orientation with me and sat through it again. After hearing Matt speak I left there feeling like I could conquer the world with Results. The first day I was so scared and felt very self-conscious. My sister was with me so I knew I wasn’t alone in my feelings. I remember walking in and see Jayme’s smiling face and I thought ok she looks nice maybe this won’t be that bad. The coaches that day were amazing and very welcoming. They took the time to show us modifications for the movements that we couldn’t quite do yet and did not make us feel bad about it. The next few weeks got easier and we started making friends with other members and having jokes with our coaches. The meal prepping became easier and eventually became routine. I found myself sad on my rest days because I wanted to go to the gym. Being at the gym is such a positive, motivating and inspirational experience. It’s not just about the workouts or the meal prep, it’s the support that you get at Results. I feel like I have made the best decision of my life and I am never looking back. In my first six weeks I lost 22lbs and dropped two sizes in my clothes. My friends and family are saying how awesome I look and can tell my real confidence is coming back. I am running and being more active than I was before and I am loving it. Thank you so much to all the Coaches at Sunrise Results. SUNRISE….RISE UP!!</Text>

I just finished my 6 week challenge at Results. I lost 23 pounds, i'm super excited about it and of course i couldn't have done it without the help of an amazing FitFam team and coaches. The coaches are fabulous! They will push, motivate and help you to succeed. This program is REAL and so are the results... take a step now for a better future! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻< /Text>

<Text>I was skeptical at first and was nervouse at the same time when I decided to take on their 20lbs Challenge.  First few sessions were hard and something that I was still getting used to, but as time went on, it was more enjoyable.  The group work out sessions and the support of their coaches inspired and pushed me more to try harder and succeed.  The supportive atmosphere is hard to find in ANY gym, but it is present here.  When you are falling behind, there is ALWAYS someone to give you an encouraging word when you need it most.  This gym is fun, challenging, and something to SWEAT FOR!  Yes, in this gym I lost 25 lbs and I went from a border line 40 waist to a tight 36...AND THATS IN SIX WEEKS!  The prices are not cheap, but are affordable and are well worth it. You will love this place!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have been a member of results transformation center for several years and can’t imagine being anywhere else. These people that I workout with have become my family… my “fit fam”. I did the challenge as a member and I truly feel like it has set the tone for me going into 2021. I did all but one of my workouts from the comfort of my own home. The online (results anywhere) library is terrific and I love the live stream classes. The coaches are all great at keeping the workouts exciting and challenging too. They also offer many alternative exercise options for my troubled knee and old shoulder injury. I would recommend Results to anyone who is serious about their fitness goals. It is a fun, energetic, positive place plus they have a super supportive staff. I’ve never met anyone I did not like or was not positive and quick to offer help. The staff goes  beyond with checking in on us when we are not there (yes, they notice), helping you with setting goals as well as helping you achieve them, and always have great nutritional advice. The program doesn’t allow you to starve or waste away. It offers different options to suit what is best for your body’s needs.
Many many thanks to all the Results staff and my FitFam! 12.21.20 posted for Rancho Cordova location<//text>< Pictures>

Just completed my 3rd round at results gym.  Lost another 20lbs.  Still the best decision I made for myself.  Lost over 70lbs total, dropped 3 shirt sizes since January.  Coming to this place is a daily routine now, it does not feel like a choir (some days are harder than others but still worth it!).  Thank you Jayme, Danny, JJ, Curtis and all of the other staff for making this a great place to be at and part of the fit fam.< /Text>

I am a return challenger.  I first took the 6 week challenge last year January 2015 and went on to complete 3 challenges then became a member.  What happened…vacation and I couldn’t get my head back into the game my fault CERTAINLY NOT a reflection of Results.  I struggled and finally said I need the accountability that the 6 week challenge provides me.  I cannot say enough how much I love Results and their coaches and my fitfam.  The coaches are tough but only because they see your potential when you don’t.  They are there to guide you thru the process and assist you in your success.  My advice to anyone who may be on the fence about a program you owe it to yourself to get the best you, what do you have to lose?    Results Transformation is the key to your success…make the decision and join the challenge you’ll never look back and you’ll be happy you did it.</Text>

<Review>I just completed the Results Transformation Center’s 6 week 20 pound Challenge and 22.8 pounds are gone! I say the pounds are “gone” because “lost” implies they can be found again and that’s not what Results is all about. The Results plan is about transformation and making a new commitment to healthy living. I don’t plan to “find” those pounds again. In fact, I’m on the path to getting rid of 20 more!

This 6 week challenge is about two things: healthy eating and working your body. The coaches give you a meal plan and ask you to work out 1 hour at least 5 days a week. It's “real food” you prepare however you want with approved ingredients and a couple of protein shakes thrown in for all the exercising. I’ve done weight loss plans before (Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers and High Protein/Low Carb Meal Replacement Foods) and haven’t been successful keeping the weight off. This plan is different because I don’t have to learn how to eat “real food” after getting to my ideal weight – I’m eating it all along the way!

The workouts are challenging but also customizable to different fitness levels. The first few sessions were hard and my body was sore but, as time went on, it became more enjoyable and I felt myself getting stronger every day. The coaches are positive and supportive. They will push you hard but will also make sure that you are exercising safely and will teach you modifications if you have any injuries. When falling behind or feeling like giving up on a certain exercise, there is always someone to give you an encouraging word.

I won't lie and tell you it's easy because nothing worth anything is ever easy.  You will be amazed by how your life changes and how you grow though. I have a new mentality about food, water and exercising. Before the challenge I drank a lot of coffee and diet soda. After the challenge, I’d prefer water (I amazed myself that I could go 6 weeks without drinking anything other than water). At the end of a stressful work day, I would have opted for putting up my feet and grabbing a glass of wine. But now I look forward to getting to the gym for a sweaty workout!

If you’re looking for a gym to wear your cute outfits and you hair and makeup is perfect, this isn’t the place for you. If you’re looking for a fun and challenging workout in a supportive environment where you’ll make good friends and watch yourself transform, come check out Results Transformation Center.< /Review>< userid>

I just completed my third challenge with an additional 21lbs down, which brings my total to 71lbs in 18 weeks! I am now feeling more confident, energetic, and no longer that couch potato from when I first started.  I am so grateful to Results Transformation Center, the coaches, and Fitfam.  I look forward to each work out and truly feel like I am missing out if I am unable to attend.  I look forward to seeing the warm smiling faces from all aspects of the gym.  I receive so much encouragement and motivation and it really means so much to me. I can now say I am able to do full burpees and run around the building without stopping. I push myself more because of the support of surrounding fitfam that want to see me do well.  Their encouragement allows me to be encouraging to someone else, and I am so appreciative.  With them, I push myself harder, aim to do better and have loved the whole process.
I received a wonderful compliment from a coach that said if only he recorded me when I first started to now, so I can see how far I’ve come.  That really put a smile on my face because I really give it my all when I’m there.  I know I’ve come a long way and want to accomplish so much more.  I completed this challenge and look forward to crushing round number 4.  I can’t wait to see these next results, If I feel this great now, the world better watch out in 6 more weeks!!!!<//Review>

I am getting ready to start my 5th challenge with Results and in just 6 more short weeks I will have lost 100 pounds with this Results team! I started with Results in June 2015 and I completed 3 challenges back to back. I stopped after my 3rd challenge losing 75 pounds. I decided to become a member following my 3rd challenge. After the holidays I realized I needed this program to take me all the way to the end. So I started my 4th challenge in Jan 2016 and I not only lost the holiday weight, but I am only 6 more pounds from "one"derland!! I am finally reaching goals I thought were NEVER going to happen. This is the real deal!! There is nothing tricky about this program. They give you the tools and rules, you show up and follow them and you will see RESULTS! Simple as that. Its not easy making changes but if you are ready to make a change and you want to challenge a "money back guarantee" system and you are ready to feel good again, then do it here! you have nothing to lose but unwanted weight!! Good luck and hope to see you at the Sunrise location soon!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>So I finally took the plunge and signed up for the six week 20 pound challenge. Best decision ever! I lost 30 lbs in six weeks and I feel amazing. These are exactly the kind of workouts I need to stay motivated and to push myself.

So I just finished my second challenge and it was another success!! To be honest it was more difficult than the first challenge but if you STTFP it will work for you. I'm also excited about my Non Scale Victories (NSV). When I started twelve weeks ago a could barely hold a plank or do a burpee. Now I can knock em out no problem (sorta). I'm excited to get started on my third challenge!<//Review><user_id>116638497298189035574</user_id><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< time>

<text>Seems like a good concept paying up front but if you lose a certain amount of weight you get your money back.  In reality be prepared to be pushed beyond your ability without the coach asking what your ability is, what your limitations are.  Be prepared to be punished if you don't put a name tag on- yep 30 burpees and this is even if you are not able to physically do one burpee on your second day in the program and you will not be told that you are required to put a name tag on every single day. You may or may not be told you can modify a push up, a plank or a burpee but be prepared that you may get reprimanded and penalized if you do modify an exercise.  No time to work up to  being able to perform a required routine, do it and do it strong or be called out and humiliated.  Are coaches told to hone in on certain people to get them to drop out.  I am thinking yes- after all then the owners get to keep the clients $400.00 without that client even taking up a position in the class.  I wondered how this gym makes money if they give back the money paid up front - at least $400.00 if you lose 20 pounds..well after spending two days- minus five minutes when I walked out- I am pretty sure I know.  I wish everyone injured or put into a medical emergency in this program would post here- and don't ever think about getting your money back or having anyone who works at this gym or is a business partner in this gym understanding any of its downfalls.  After all - they are getting rich!< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
I finally joined Results after seeing one of the moms of a kid who plays softball with my daughter coming to the games with her food and protein shakes and eating on schedule while we all scarfed down the crappy snack bar food. After a while I saw her slimming down and then the light bulb went on in my head that it was time to do what she was doing. I’ve lost weight and gained muscle before, on my own, which is one of the main reasons I didn’t join Results sooner – I kept saying to myself “When I’m ready I can do it on my own again. I don’t need to pay $500 to have someone tell me what to eat and how to exercise in order to lose weight!” But in fact, that is EXACTLY what I needed! The first week of the program I felt horrible because they make you do fitness testing to determine the exercises that you can/cannot do, for safety reasons. I am an athletic person but when I discovered that I was too out of shape to do a squat or lunge the proper way it depressed the heck out of me! I wanted to quit that night, but I remembered Matt and all the other speakers at the orientation saying, “Don’t quit, just finish the program.” So I did.

Over the course of 6 weeks I went from not being able to squat properly to being able to do a full squat holding 20 lb weights. I’ve gone from having little knowledge about the proper supplementation to use, to knowing exactly what to take before, during, and after my workouts to maximize the results. I’ve gone from a woman with very little discipline to a woman disciplined enough to prepare my meals ahead of time and eat on schedule. This program has helped me kick my sugar and caffeine addiction and to care more about what I put into my body. Since starting results my daughter, who is an athlete, is beginning to eat better and to be mindful about how she fuels her body as well. Yes I lost 24.2 pounds on my first round of the challenge, but the non-scale victories outweigh those pounds by far.

I will end by warning you, this program is NOT easy and if you’re like me you will have to deal with your abnormal emotional connection to food, which can take a toll on you. Understand that you will have to eat according to the meal plan while everyone else around you grubs on whatever they want. So at birthday parties and holidays you’ll have to bring your own food or stay home to avoid succumbing to temptation. And alcohol is out of the question! The workouts are intense and you will be pushed, in a loving but firm way, not only by the coaches but by the other challengers. You will be held accountable in this challenge, and your level of success solely depends on how hard you are willing to work both in the gym and in the kitchen. Really check in with yourself before committing to this program, if you are not ready to be focused and disciplined then this is not the program for you. But if you are ready to eat clean and train hella dirty, then join us – it’ll be the most transformative six weeks of your adult life.<//Review>

I am very proud to share how excited I am about the Results Transformation  that has occurred in my life due to this life changing Gym. In the 6 weeks that my challenge took place, I gained so much, just not weight!  I have learned to trust that my body can do so much, given the right training and support.  My 2 nephews and niece and brother have been successful and I had seen such a difference in their bodies and stamina, I decided to go to the orientation, along with Julia, my daughter. We both decided to join the challenge.  I was impressed each and every workout at the caliber of the workouts and trainers/coaches and the support of the members and other 'challengers'.  Everyone is cheering you on both in the workouts and the results. I loved not having to think about what I was going to do at the 'gym', as I had in the past ( although I wasted so much money not going...). When Matt Weaver explained at orientation why Results was different and why the other gym mentality I had didn't work, I knew I was committed to do this.  And I did!  I lost over 23 lbs, and am able to do more each workout.  It does take discipline and planning, but I was determined to be healthier.  The coaches help with modifications for any physical issues and are very concerned about each person's success. Kudos to JJ, Curtis, Consuelo, Brydan, Danny and Will, as well as my new Fit Family to helping me.  I am starting my 2nd challenge and very excited about how much stronger and healthier I can become!</Review>

Results Transformation Center is unlike any other gym I have ever been too.  The coaches and staff are amazing ----They motivate you and push you to do your best, help with proper form, and give modifications based on any injuries you have or inability to do a certain exercise.  The classes are pretty difficult and you can push yourself and maximize your efforts to make the workout that much better.  A lot of the workout are simple types of exercises --- squats, push ups, wall ball's, and burpees.... lots of burpees.  And if you think you can't do a burpee, you will be able to after a very short time I promise!  And then there is your fit fam.... the most amazing and motivating group of people, who are there, just like you.  To have fun, get an amazing and hard workout, learn about nutrition and suppliments to help you make it through the workout, and overall, it makes you feel like a true family.  I can't recommend Results enough besides to say that if you have been unhappy with your diet or eating habits, need to loose weight and make some lifestyle changes, and the box type gyms are not fitting the bill (because they don't).... Try Results.  If you put in MAXIMUM EFFORT, you will get MAXIMUM RESULTS!  Sunrise..... RISE UP!<//Text>

<review>I was inspired by a couple of friends who did this challenge earlier and amazed by their transformation. It had been a while I was looking to shed a few pounds and bascially be more fit and energetic. Results was the place to go.

It was definately not easy, one of the most challenging 6 weeks of my life but the small victories during that period kept me going. Sticking to the food plan was the crucial part of the plan and more challenging for a vegetarian. Coaches at results helped me out at each and every step be it meal planning, tweaking them when it wasnt working well and pushing us to the brink at every exercise session. A big shout to coach Lea who was replying to my messages during her vacation just so that my meal plan is tweaked at the right time. This is an example of the amazing dedication these coaches have towards all the challengers.

To start with I never thought I would have made my 20 pound, but with all the tips and pointers I could finally do it, much to my amaze. I feel much lighter, could run much faster than before and rock most of my classes too. Greatest joy is fitting into your old clothes which would have never been possible otherwise.

Thanks fit fam, coaches and results at sunrise. I am a proud member of the gym and looking to get better each day.< /review>< Rate>

I started the challenge a week ago and I'm very nervous.  I don't know how I'm going to lose the 20 lbs. Please read the following review from a year ago......   the experience of lori brown is my experience EXACTLY! !!  very disappointed!  You are on your own, they don't teach proper form, don't allow proper warm up, don't teach you to breath. They mention it, but in passing only. It's up to you , really!!! To get your money back. LISTEN CLOSELY!!! YOUR MONEY IS BETTER SPENT ON A PERSON AL TRAINER.

Seems like a good concept paying up front but if you lose a certain amount of weight you get your money back.  In reality be prepared to be pushed beyond your ability without the coach asking what your ability is, what your limitations are.  Be prepared to be punished if you don't put a name tag on- yep 30 burpees and this is even if you are not able to physically do one burpee on your second day in the program and you will not be told that you are required to put a name tag on every single day. You may or may not be told you can modify a push up, a plank or a burpee but be prepared that you may get reprimanded and penalized if you do modify an exercise.  No time to work up to  being able to perform a required routine, do it and do it strong or be called out and humiliated.  Are coaches told to hone in on certain people to get them to drop out.  I am thinking yes- after all then the owners get to keep the clients $400.00 without that client even taking up a position in the class.  I wondered how this gym makes money if they give back the money paid up front - at least $400.00 if you lose 20 pounds..well after spending two days- minus five minutes when I walked out- I am pretty sure I know.  I wish everyone injured or put into a medical emergency in this program would post here- and don't ever think about getting your money back or having anyone who works at this gym or is a business partner in this gym understanding any of its downfalls.  After all - they are getting rich!< /text>

<Text>When you're done feeling sorry for yourself, tired of being tired, ready to start living again, and done being the person you said you would "NEVER BE!!!" When you're tired of hiding from mirrors, and social gatherings, and pictures. When you decide YOU ARE WORTH IT. Run, don't walk, to your nearest Results Transformation Center. Whether you need to lose 20 or 200 this is the place. If you don't want coaches who care, to work out with people that will become your family, and be pushed and motivated while you reach your fitness goals, this is NOT the place for you. This is NOT your typical big box gym...you WIll be greet...you will be shown how to use the equipment...you will be cared about...you will be shown how to make this a lifestyle...you WILL succeed here. Will it be hardwork? YES. WIll it be worth it? NO DOUBT. This isn't just a gym, its a 2nd home. As an ex athlete, now 41 years old, four kids later, I have found my strength, competitiveness, and love for what my body is capable of again. Thank you Results Sunrise with just one round of the 20lb challenge, you have given me mental, and physical health back. Here's to another round and becoming a member.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I'll take this moment to thank my friends, family, coaches and the random supporters I have had  throughout this first round of the #results20 challenge.  Regardless of circumstance it's nice to know that ones drive and faith can overcome any assortment of obstacles put in front of you.  Special thanks to Coach Lea, Coach JJ, Coach Curtis, Coach Rachel, Coach Brydon, Coach Will, Jayme and the whole results family - you are truly amazing.  Weight loss for round 1 was 46.6 lbs and the drive to get there was as much mentally challenging as physically.  The friendships built and belief in yourself are worth more than any amount of money.  I look forward to the 2nd round and the the goal set forth the second I came off the scale - beat round 1. :)  There aren't enough good things to say about this program, the gym or the people.  See you around!<//text>

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about Results before I began. I mean, how could I lose 20lbs in 6 weeks! I really didn’t eat that poorly and had tried personal training before so what did they do what was so different? At the same time I wanted results and trying on my own, meaning 1-2 weeks of giving my all at the gym with an hour cardio and an hour weights wasn’t moving the dial like I wanted/needed. After seeing two friends on Facebook succeed through Results, I decided, what else do I have to lose besides time (which will pass anyway) and money (which I can potentially get back). I decided to sign up and I am so happy I did. I was pleasantly surprised at how challenging the workouts were considering the differing fitness levels of members. I was also surprised by the attention to detail and proper form considering the class size to coach ratio. I always felt like there was assistance when needed. The only negatives I can think of are: 1. The first week’s works for M-F repeated on week 2 and week 5’s work outs repeated on week 6.  2. The coach’s tend to play the same music on from their play lists so it can be a bit repetitive, i.e. it’s Monday so, ___ workout, with ___ music. However, the positives, by far, outweigh any negatives. The coaches are all very enthusiastic and it honestly feels genuine, the fellow challengers and members are all positive and encouraging and well, it’ s not called results for nothing! Over 6 weeks I lost the 20lbs, was it easy? No! but was it worth the effort, time and money?! Yes! I am so pleased with the overall quality of workouts and the atmosphere that I decided to become a member.  I highly recommend Results and plan on continuing my fitness goals at their facility. Their staff is the best of any I’ve experienced (Cal-Fit, 24-hour, Anytime, etc.). They get to know you, your goals, your strengths and weakness and welcome you with open arms.  They support and push you (when you need it) to meet you goals. I’m happy that I took a chance with results.</Text>

I'm going to start by saying if you are on Yelp, Google, FB, etc. reading reviews on gyms, look no further. Results is the gym you want to go to. I can say that with confidence because Results changed my life. Most people can't say that about a gym. Do I have your attention now?
My story is short and sweet: I am 23 years old and in the year I spent planning my wedding I gained around 20 pounds. That was on top of the 15 I had gained from being happy and in a relationship. I went in to the doctors office for a routine visit and to my surprise the number '180.5' was staring back at me on the scale. I wanted to cry and I knew something had to change. I needed to change. I already had a membership a small gym that has nice equipment but I lack motivation. I am not the kind of person that can walk into the gym and know what I'm going to do. Even with my 'workout' board on Pinterest, I got nothing.
When I heard about Results, I was skeptical. But when I went to the orientation, all my scepticism disappeared. Results is a gym that requires work and dedication. They aren't about pre-packaged food plans or juice cleanses. You eat real food that you cook. You work out with coaches that push you to be your best and you are amongst friendly faces that support you. The environment is upbeat and clean with huge superhero murals covering the walls. You aren't greeted by empty, daunting machinery, but smiling coaches and friends ready to give you a high five. And, my favorite part: you aren't starving. Ever. When you stick to the plan, you are eating every 2.5-3 hours. You have three meals and three snacks, so no starvation going on.
I will say, the 6 week Challenge was not easy. You have to be ready to sweat, and I mean really sweat. But it was EXACTLY what I needed. By the end I lost 21 pounds but I gained so much confidence. I feel healthy again. I am able to fit into most of my old cloths which I didn't think was possible. I am in love with myself again. I still have some work to do, but now I know I can do it. The 6 week Challenge is not just a 'challenge', it's a healthy lifestyle change. It's amazing. You owe it to yourself to try it.< /review>

I am just your average college student. I go to school full time during the mornings, I go to work full time during the evenings, and then I spend the rest of the day sleeping and wondering why I put myself through so much stress and don’t feel any happier. Then I saw this quote by Charles Bukowski. “If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it’s your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life.” My epiphany hit me like a wrecking ball. Life before all the stress was full of physical activity. I lived for the thrill of physical exertion…but lately I’ve been so bummed because I haven’t been living my passion. After that quote I read an ad for Results Transformation. Like everyone else on Facebook, I scrolled passed it quiet a few times before I finally got the courage to give it a go. I was apprehensive because I’ve done the “gym thing” before. You’re there on your own sweating it out and it gets boring after a while, you forget to go, you get sidelined by an injury, and you start making other excuses for why you can’t go. It’s easy to fall off the wagon. But Results was so much more than your average gym! They gave me a nutrition plan, helped me find my whys: keeping up with my speedy little sister, finishing a Spartan Race with my athletic friends, and seeing that 6 pack again! When I told my coach I screwed up my shoulder, she was quick to show me modifiers and corrective exercises to help my aching muscles. I was offered a supportive forum to speak with others about my difficulties during the challenge, both metal and physical difficulties. I was offered so much more support than I had ever received at any gym I had gone to before. My coaches and fitfam at Results Transformation became my reason for continuing with Results after the 6 week 20 pound challenge. I’m now a member of the most awesome place I’ve ever had the pleasure of sweating at and I couldn’t be happier! If you are anything like me, then I’d highly recommend putting away the pizza, getting off the couch, and giving them a go. See ya there!</text>

<rating>4<//rating><review>My wife wanted me to give up alcohol for six weeks and spend that money to loose 20 pound in weight loss challenge and this whole experience changed my lifestyle and how I view my health and fitness.  It wasn't easy at the beginning of the challenge but at the end of six weeks I felt it was one of the best decision ever made . I not only lost 20 pounds but my perception changed a lot on many of things .

1. I can fit to my old clothes which I had from graduation ( 8 yrs old ) yet new clothes since I never got a chance to wear them .
2. I feel energised during the entire day after morning workout . I feel I am more productive , active both managing work and personal life .
3. Fit Fam - coach , people at this gym are so supportive and fun.The coaches at Sunrise are extremely helpful and answer all our dumb questions about fitness and clean eating.
4. Now I have new perspective about workout and eating habits . I have made changes even after the 6 week challenge to maintain the weight which I lost which is key to success . I feel discipline should be for life time and not just for six weeks . So I ended up becoming a Fit Fam member after my 6 week challenge .
5. I have gained self confidence , discipline , perseverance.

This 6 week challenge was about eating clean , work out and sticking to the STTFP.. The coaches customized meal plan , reviewed the plan and made sure we stick to it .  They made us work out at least 5-6 days a week. I also made sure I did a 30 -45 cardio in the evening since I used to go to gym in the morning .The six week challenge isn't easy but doable . I lost almost 23 pounds in 6 weeks and now a proud member of the club.

I highly encourage anyone considering this to make an investment in themselves . It will be a lie changing experience and you will life from an different angle .

Thank you guys !<//review>< pictures>

Results....this is definetly a gym that lives up to its name, if you put in the work and stick to the plan results is what you will get. If you are ready to make a change in your life and surround yourself wirh positive, motivated people all working towarda the same common goal this is the place for you.
The coaches are awesome and are there to motivate you and push you to help you reach your full potential. They are knowledgable and most of all care about each challenger/member and care about helping you reach your short and long time fitness goals. After six weeks I guarantee that you will feel stronger, confident and a sense of accomplishment that you have not felt before. After my first challenge I lost a total of 22.4 pounds and I cannot wait for the 2nd challenge to begin. There is no other gym that offers pwrsonalized trainning up to 7 days a week as well as a meal plan, not to mention the wonderful motivated staff willing to help you reach your goals and achieve success. Thanks Results Sunrise!<//text>

<name>Treston Shull< /name><text>I must start off again by thanking the wonderful staff of the Rancho Cordova – Sunrise location for being an AMAZING STAFF and THE BEST MOTIVATORS.  I was 333lbs when I started round 1 but knew that I had to do this challenge again because my body fat and BMI were still no in the proper range.  I’m grateful this rules are in place because in reality I knew that I NEEDED to do it one more time.
Many things stand out about this challenge for a round 1, 2 and 3 person.  First, the coaches were and continued to be SMART, MOTIVATING and ACCOMIDATING!  In most of todays’ gyms you rarely find that, let alone all THREE!  Second, this program continues to make YOU accountable and gives you the structure and plan to succeed.  Third, YOU can succeed if you STICK TO THE PLAN that they give you no matter how many rounds you do.  I stuck to the plan 95% of the time and for that I was rewarded with a total weight loss of 76lbs!
I had my 3rd final weigh-in on February 15th and was so happy to see that I had lost an additional 26.4lbs in my 3rd 6 WEEKS!  I have now lost a total of 76lbs exactly in 18 WEEKS!  There are no gimmicks here and never were, only hard work and dedication by the challengers and coaches at RESULTS TRANSFORMATION CENTER.  I’m proud to say that I completed all 3 of my challenges and would become a member in a HEARTBEAT!  Everyone should know that by sticking to the plan and listening to the coaches and staff at RESULTS, they will succeed time and time again and make their goal of losing 20lbs or MORE in just 6 short weeks.
Thank you RESULTS GYM and Coaches for showing me what can be done!

<Rating>1</Rating><review>First of all, they accept CASH ONLY, no invoice, no receipt. You have to trust that the bill is fine though it is not. They say they apply 15% tip automatically even if they serve less than 6 in a table, tip is mandatory for the only waitress/cashier they have. Since no receipt, don’t know how the bill is break down. Between tax and tip you pay more than  what It should be. They have a big B category in the entrance.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29bb45ab001fd:0x7a9f906307732b86</Gmap_id></record>

This place was introduced to me by one of my really good friends and I have to say it truly is one of the BEST Peruvian restaurants I've ever tried. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best period.< /text>

Simply the best Peruvian food you could possibly try. My family and friends try to come here every weekend because the delicious food keeps bringing us back. The service was good even when it got busy with people who also go there for the amazing food. The most famous would be their Pollo a la brasa with the hand cut french fries and crispy chicken which is to die for. La Copa was really good as well with a lot of different sea foods and the Lomo Saltado is a beef person's paradise. Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants great Peruvian food or great food in general. It's a perfect place to bring your friends and family. Enjoy the food!</text>

<Review>This place has the worst service ever. Every time I come there is always an excuse as to why they can't make a dish that is on the menu. Right now it is 8pm they close at 9pm and they said they can't make food because their about to close. Horrible service.< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) It is an antigenic place, and poor customer treatment I don't know if it is the owner or the manager but it offers a lousy service. mistreating customers that we go to the place to spend our money not to give us free.

(Original)
Es un lugar antigienico, y mal trato al cliente no se si es la dueña o la manager pero ofrece un servicio pésimo. maltratando al los clientes  q vamos al lugar a gastar nuestro dinero no a que nos den gratis.< /Review>

I purchased a mobile home 3 months ago. It is centrally located for all my needs. The freeways and American River College are nearby and the rent is reasonable.
Mario our manager is excellent. He is always busy but positive. He is friendly and answers my questions in a timely manner. He makes our park safe and clean. The people here are friendly. From what I see the mobile home park  is a community<//Text>

< Review>
My family and I have been staying here since we relocated to the Sacramento area in June, and I have to say it has been an amazing experience. We didn't really know what to expect seeing as how "trailer parks" are notorious for being crazy but that's not the case at this location. From day one the manager Mario has been super helpful, even meeting us outside of business hours when we were available to come down and see the park before we officially moved. They have been more than accommodating on several occasions since our arrival as well. It is quiet and calm, my kids love the nice clean pool, and we are more comfortable here than I ever thought we would be. I havn't had to worry about my children's safety, or anybody touching or taking our things either (which are standard worries for any densely populated area). All in all, I am very glad we chose this park to be at while we were making this huge transition to a new area and appreciate how well maintained everything here is!< /Review>

<Review>Yogurtland is fun to come with a group. It is self-serve and you can sample flavors before you commit to them, which is nice. They have great toppings too - the rainbow sprinkles are on point. They measure your yogurt by weight before you pay. The atmosphere is bright and very colorful, making it a fun place to come with kids.</Review>< user>

<Text>I Love my yogurtland. The staff is great. There is always a variety flavors and toppings. The only down side is that sometime they take out my favorites for new flavors. Also sometime they will close 20-15mins early. Other than that they are great. Give them a try, treat yourself... you deserve it.<//Text>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) Very tasty, many different flavors, but I prefer to eat the basics like chocolate and vanilla. Also a lot of choice in toppings and you can add as much as you want, because you pay per gram and not per cup.

Erg lekker, veel verschillende soorten smaken, maar zelf hou ik het liefst bik de basics zoals chocola en vanille. Ook veel keuze in toppings en je kan zoveel toevoegen als je wilt, want je betaald per gram en niet per beker.< /Text>

Hercules Dental has a very professional, honest, friendly and staff who has changed my perspective on dental care.  The quality of their work is superior to any other dentist I've ever been to.  They were even able to correct some of the mistakes my former dentists made which I didn't think was possible.    If you are looking for a new dentist, I highly recommend that you check them out.</Review>

I have been going to this office for years. Since Dr. Tucker. The kindness, service and professionalism has always transferred over. I love how most of the staff has been there for years and always greet me with a smile and welcoming small talk.
Whatever service they are performing that day, they always explain what’s going on and where I need to do better. I always feel that they act in my best interest.</text>

<text>Awesome service, everyone is super friendly and professional. The space was very clean and comfy. All the dentists, especially Dr. Lin,  were very gentle with my teeth during cleaning. I have pretty sensitive teeth and my teeth will usually go numb for an hour or two after cleaning but my teeth did not hurt this time. Thank you!<//text>< Pictures>

Great staff and dentist! My son and daughter loved their experience. It was my daughter's first time and they made her feel comfortable enough to have a full visit.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the waiting room. There was nothing for children  (books, pictures, etc). It did seem like a blank slate so maybe they're in the process of adding those in.

Thank you for treating my kids so wonderfully!</review>

Can't say enough about their warm and friendly atmosphere. From Receptionist Carmen big welcoming smile  to Hygienist Tammy gentliness and efficiency. DDS Andrew Lu(?) Thoroughness and patience explaining  procedures. Going to the Dentist isny always fun.. however. When you're treated  like family.. Then it's not so bad!<//text>

As a parent of a team gymnast, I can not say enough good things about Airborne after experiencing 2 other competing gyms in the area. Airborne and its team coaches are dedicated to the girls and their success. The feedback my daughter receives while being coached is always done in a positive manner. Through Covid, Airborne did everything they possibly could under the County guidelines to continue the team’s training and we are forever grateful. Parents can observe practices through Spot TV. The facility is regularly sanitized and exceptionally clean with health and safety being top priority at the gym. Airborne is our daughter’s “happy place”. She loves gymnastics and Airborne is the perfect fit for her and our family.</review>

My son has attended Airborne's Mini Mach, Mach 1 and now their Mach 2 parkour classes. He also has celebrated 2 birthdays there. Those alone are worth 4 stars.

However, the reason why I gave 5 stars and why I recommend them to anyone who has a kid who needs to get some energy out: when the restrictions were lifted and we came back for class and camps, they were so excited to see my son. All the staff who knew him welcomed him back. It was very special to see a place that he loves love him back.

So give them a try. I'm pretty sure you'll be happy you did.</text>

<Text>Good place for kids. Teachers are good. They have all needed equipment too. Even the young lady from reception staff is good, but the old lady is too rigid. Because of the rigidness i wanted to give 1 or 2 stars only but just because of 1 person,I can not overlook the good thing they have.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I came here for a birthday party.

Parking is difficult!  It is in an office complex and I wasn't sure if I was parking in an approved spot or not.

The party was for 5 to 6 yr olds.  There was a separate sign in table for the birthday.  It would be helpful to know in advance that the children need to be barefoot, as some of the girls came wearing tights.  The staff was attentive to the kids.  There were bleachers on 1 side of the gym, where the parents could sit and watch.

After the play, the party continued upstairs.  There was additional bleacher  seating in front of a large window where you could see the entire gym floor below. There were also additional bathrooms upstairs.

The kids had a great time and the parents had an opportunity to talk.<//text>

Worst policy ever. Don’t go if you want to see how your kids are doing on gym. The admins and coaches don’t allow to watch on my kid in dynomight class:(.

The owner in the comments replied that viewing areas are available for parents, but it is not entirely true. Some corner areas with bars are completely invisible for parents, but I think we have full right to check our kids progress especially at such disciplines as bars, etc, which are not trivial.

Asking for help at the desk is no help at all, because associates there are simply unhelpful not to say rude.</Text>

<review>Coaches are great, but admin staff at the front desk is not very friendly and sometimes simply rude.
I’ve been forced to pay double the price for kids birthday party because receptionist has made a reservation for 20 kids instead of requested 10.
And even after after trying to convince them that it was their mistake, they still kept referring to emails they’ve sent, that had a number of guests.</review>< GmapID>

Below zero! Very bad experience with private lessons. If anything happens and you plan to go to top management, you will be chocked of how BAD you will be treated. NO RESPECT at all...... super disappointing  and frustrating experience.......</text>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>The communication among staff members to clients are very disruptive.  I called to place my children on summer camp, and the session I would like was full.  The manager added a coach and was able to accept my children.  I was told I have to pay the next business day, but there was a holiday in between, Memorial weekend.  I was told by Jennifer, just call us on Tuesday and we will hold the spots if you will commit, but unable to drop off payment.  Well, our Master card had unauthorized charges and a new card is being sent to us.  AB doesn't accept AE or Discover, and the manager denied that she said to call and she will hold the spots because they have a wait list now.  I told them my husband can walk from his building to their site and will pay tomorrow when the replacement card arrives.  However, we were given extension to 10 AM or they will give the spots away.   They even claimed that they have given us extension, which is a complete lie.  It is late and we are both working so we have to find camp for my children, we will not come back to this place next year.  The lack of consistency and integrity is tough to do business with.<//Review>< Pics>

Kids have gone to this place for a few years now (3 years old to 6), and love it.  Teachers are kind but firm.

Had a birthday party there, too.  Very fun.< /review>

Excellent coaches , coach AJ is the best , and coach Cory is great.

I would rate 5 for the coaches -- super excellent. But rate negative 5 for the front desk .

Unfortunately the receptionist and the support staff is full of BS. Very, ineffective and horrible customer service . Especially the Asian elderly lady , Is so snobbish that she thinks she is running a charity. In fact charging through the nose !< /Text>

<review>We love Airborne. The spotters/teachers seem to be really responsible and they always have a pleasant attitude.  We have used this facility for a few years, for gymnastics. I like the flexibility that drop-in classes provide.<//review>< Pictures>

If you are looking for a gym to call home and plan to be there a long time this is NOT  the one!

My son broke his arm so I called from the hospital as a courtesy to the gym let them know my daughter would not make it to her class.  While I had them on the phone I decided to schedule her make up class without my calendar in front of me. I later realized I would be out of town at the time I scheduled her make up so I called back the next day, the day BEFORE her make up was scheduled and they would not let me reschedule it. I had my own gymnastics program in AZ and this is the most ridiculous policy I've ever heard.  It's not like we missed our make up class and are trying to make up our make up!  I was essentially going to slide into a class in an hour that still had openings and open up room for the next day.  They kept telling me that they were saving a spot for me so IF someone called to do their make up then would have already told them no.  My thought was that it hasn't happened yet, so IF someone calls they could give it to them.  So sad they are willing to lose customer over not letting them attend a different make up ahead of time when there was room in both classes! I am withdrawing my daughter from the program.  When looking for a gym, we are essentially looking for a home.  We literally just paid and registration fee last week, attended one class and they won't refund our $50 registration fee either. They are clearly a money driven program and have terrible customer services.  The manager also told me there IS flexibility to this policy given the circumstance, but MY circumstance wasn't one of those.  When I asked to speak to the owner he told me she would just be referring me back to him since he was in charge of the recreation dept.<//review>

Wow. What a shock. I found myself quite surprised by the people who work here. My daughter likes her teacher but when I had a question about my bill the front desk woman was snappy and then the owner came out (I think her name was Mel ?) basically threw the bill in my face and said "that's the price. Take it or leave it" and then walked away. And this is only our first month here! We're going somewhere else, thank you</review>

<Text>I really want to be in this gymnastics because I want people to see that I can do it that I try my best. people at my school know how to do gymnastics and I don't and it makes me sad because I don't know they start to laugh at me and start to call me names. when gymnastics comes on the TV it makes me do it but I cant I be asking my mom to sign me up she says no because she doesn't got that kind of money. So i get sad i hope i can be in one<//Text><GmapID>0x808fca2f00d06705:0x3f8fe351f6c84d25<//GmapID><user_name>Angel Virelas<//user_name>< Rate>

<text>With the loss of their best team coaches Justin Howell and Liz Crandall, the team coaching is stretched among "the leftover coaches" who are verbally abusive and the owner who appears to not even want to be out on the floor.  If you think your daughter will go into team here, get ready for her to come home in tears.  In my opinion, they are less interested in coaching girls with promise than waiting for the "already gifted" girls to walk in to door to maintain their gym's credibility.  The recreation side of the house builds girls confidence up but the team side leaves girls mentally battered and even scarred for life.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

My daughter went there for 1 year in the Dynamos class and I have nothing substantial to see as a result. Not even a flip or a head stand, forget cart wheel. There are more than 15 kids in each class and the instructors are busy dealing with them turn after turn, so there is a lot of waiting involved which becomes boring and frustrating for the kids. They have loopholes for scheduling makeups and changing the time of the class is a long wait too.</Review>

Homeless people flock the property along side the native gulls and pigeons perched on trashcans and shopping carts hoping you drop a fry... the staff's capacity for understanding an order is usually maxed at 3 items and avoid customizing sandwiches unless you plan to be there a while to reorder. Fries in this location WILL be served regardless of temperature or floor time. A word of advice ask for fries with no salt... that will usually get you a fresh batch 😉</review>< date>

It’s McDonald’s so not a lot to say about the food. Rating 3 stars for the service. Ordered for pick up 30 minutes prior to arriving and still had to wait 10….. at least it was hot and clearly made fresh.<//review>

< Review>
Fast service, but the restaurant is not very clean. There are some homeless rude people and people asking for money also inside the restaurant. Nothing against people who need help, but I am don’t feel comfortable taking my family there again.</Review>

Because the company that's  near my home, is the worst in the world. Customer service is poor and only give service to the people of the country that they are from.
Speaking  in their own language. I have worked for McDonalds in high school and college 4 the summer
The fact is we had the old fashioned way
Love the way. This place needs lots more training<//Review>

Had the McRib combo! 😔
Fries where cold & the McRib was sloppily prepared & nasty! McDonalds should've never brought that back. That was my first time trying the McRib. It was very nasty. I can get the same sandwich at the dollar store & it's way better for a dollar.</Text>

It's McDonald's. Wherever you go, you know what you're going to get. When they get busy, be sure to check your order before you leave the drive-thru. I've been given the wrong order a couple of times. No big deal, when I noticed it, they swapped it for the correct order.< /text>

As with most McDonalds the employees acted like they hate the customer & seemed annoyed that I asked for the straw that's suppose to come with it yet they forgot.  They acted annoyed with all the customers in general being there at all.  Maybe they should start their own business where customers aren't ever let in & all the employees can ignore them if they  have to do all day is kick back & look at their phones for 8 hours a day.  They can see how much money & job security theyll have after treating people who's money pays their salary.</Text>

Booths and tables. Breakfast brunch coffee and i think they had mimosas? Decor is retro 40s 50s American diner layered on what was once a Chinese restaurant. Good food.</Review>

I mobile ordered and a nice friendly worker came out to our car and delivered the meal. Didn't have to go into mc Donalds! I tipped her, bc. If this had been a restaurant... Seriously tho, these folks work super hard with few breaks to bring us good in less than a couple of minutes. I always thank them for their efforts.<//Review>

<Text>Don't waste your time there. I ordered through the app and they didn't give me my entire order. I asked for my order and they made me wait 20 minutes. Then the girl blamed me saying that I never told her what my order consisted of. I payed for large fries and they gave me small ones and when I asked for a straw for my drink the girl simply went inside. I'm never going back there.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>I went to this location to get breakfast and was told by a guy that claimed to be the manager that I can’t order food because I don’t have a car. Meanwhile they advertise that take out is available but the location is not open for takeout. He said I can find someone that have a car to order for me through drive through and then I wait for the person to give me the food. They don’t answer their phone when you call. Waist of time and lack of professionalism.
I took my business to another location.< /Text>< Pictures>

So glad that Google says that this location is open 24hrs. Unfortunately, when you show up at 12:15AM after leaving your office late on a Friday, you will see all of the lights on, staff inside, politely telling you that they are closed. Skip this spot and just goto In ‘n Out instead. :)< /review>

< Review>
First of all, I'm surprised there aren't too many McDonald's around downtown Oakland! Thus one is at the busy junction of Jackson and 14th St. It's routine as McDonald's go.

Now, I expressly go to McD's when I'm craving a quick inexpensive shot of caramel mocha on the go. But this particular location has had its machine busted for at least a week.....or more. If it don't serve coffee, what do it serve?!!?< /Review>

<review>I've used the McDonald's app multiple times (especially at this location), and today (04/22/20), I used the option to get curbside drop off in Car Stall #4. I placed an order ahead of time and arrived at the stall 15min later and no order available. I walked up to the drive-thru window and the guy tells me "you need a car". I told him that I ordered the curbside pick up (which I am in the car) through the app, and I was inquiring on the status of my order. But he told me to go through drive thru. The drive thru line was extremely long and I've been waiting for a long time already. Plus I stated thru the app, to receive the order via curbside drop off. If a worker is going to say that they're unable to do curbside and not honor the request, then there should be something on the app that disables that feature so that people don't waste their time waiting around. I didn't get my order, and I hope I get a refund for this inconvenience.<//review><rating>1<//rating></record></dataset><record>

It's McDonald's, you know what to expect. The location is usually clean and the staff is friendly and work hard. There is limited space for parking though if you don't mind waiting a few minutes something usually opens up. The drive thru gets crazy busy but they do a decent job of keeping things moving. One time they forgot items in my order but that's on me for not checking as much as anything.</review>

It was freezing outside so no surprise there. The woman working in the counter was quite rude. Instead of helping me she walked away to fry some hash browns. I must have looked like a homeless after going to the gym. So I wasn't treated very nicely either. She didn't greet me nor she thank me for  buying my food. However, I was able to get my food promptly.< /review>< name>

If you're in a rush, whether it be going through the drive through or going inside, be mindful of what time of day it is and what day of the week it is. This location gets VERY busy, prepare to be in line for a significant amount of time!!
Always make sure to check the accuracy of your order as well because my order was wrong, and I had left already when I noticed it!!!<//Text>

Hello I have bad experiences there at that location. For the first time I made a mobile order online and my was correct on the app as I placed but once I picked it up my food was incorrect. And I try all the time to call the store but they never answer the phone. So I will be going back to that location to get a full refund I was very unsatisfied<//review>

Where can I start? The service was horrible. They forgot my order. The manager was talking on her cellphone with someone about a lawyer... then she got distracted by a young men and she was just talking nonsense.  Theres a whole lot of homeless or addicts inside the restaurant with a bad odor. NEVER AGAIN!</text>

<Text>I will not go back there. Also, there was a man in there screaming and talking like he was out of his mind. As I waited for my food he left and then returning screaming absurdities. My safety was threatened. After receiving my food, I ate it about 10 mins later and my fries were cold so I dumped them. I WILL NOT be back.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Prices of every thing are a lot higher than any other McDs, some items by several dollars.

There is a 20 minute seating time limit as in they force you to leave after 20 minutes.

There are no free refills on the sodas as well.</Text>

Items ALWAYS, manager doesn’t know how to get it together and lied to my face, they NEVER pick up the phone, the hours are a lie - they are NOT open 24 hours. I tried contacting corporate and that didn’t help. I tried contacting the owner, no available. PLEASE go to another location. So you won’t have to deal with the level of incompetency that is the McDonald’s on Jackson.< /text>

Friendly and efficient staff gets orders right basically 100% of the time.  The food is consistently as expected and good. The tables and space can be a little cleaner at times, but given how many people come here, and the small but steady number of seemingly homeless unfortunate folks, it's pretty clean and decently managed (much much better than the Burger King near the 12th St bart station).</Review>

<Text>Mcdonalds has maintained a reputation of being the one stop shop for food, drinks, fries, milkshakes, breakfast, coffee, salads, ribs and whatever else you might be able to imagine. However this particular Mcdonalds was once notorious for the iconic black and yellow radical font sign on the front of it. what an absolute package this place was.<//Text>< Rating>

I just went there at 8:30 PM and was turned away by the cashiers and manager their dining Area closes at   nine but they lock their doors at 8:30 because I was told they did not want to deal with customers anymore. This is the second or third time I’ve gone  there and they’ve closed early of their own accord and it’s really frustrating because it’s bad enough online their hours are wrong but you can’t even have a chance to go there at the right time. As long as I  can remember the employees I’ve had a horrible attitude and the manager is worse😡😡😡< /Text>

It is supposed to be fast food but after you order you wait for ever and the employees are Horrible. Plus I think that they have drugs being sold from the back someone of law enforcement should look into the issue this place has.<//Review>

Doesn't open at the exact time of the business hours listed on the front of the main entrance. They are also low on employees during breakfast hours. I had to wait an hour, give or take, for the doors for dining hours to be unlocked and available for me to buy a simple beverage. It's not the employees at fault for being low staffed and unable to meet the standards that McDonald's advertises without any precaution of what the employees have to withstand the unbearable animosity from customers.< /text>

Food quality is standard for the chain.
Accuracy is good, so they get your order correct almost every time.  However, if you want ketchup for your fries, etc, you better ask.
It seems as though many of the workers are not highly fluent in English and really don't seem to care much about the customers.  They do not go out of their way to make you feel appreciated but are not overtly rude.
The property is usually not clean.
The lobby is small and often occupied with people who appear to have just left a shelter.  The lot is also small and usually full, so don't expect to park.
If you choose the drive through, which is the preferred way, be wary of the fact that you will likely need to approach and line up on Jackson street from 13th as there is only enough room for 1 car before the order speaker.
Expect to be approached by one of the panhandlers who take rotating shifts and are ignored by the staff.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Every table dirty. Lobby dirty. Ordered to eat in but ended up eating in the car. Multiple employees just standing around. Could have been cleaning the place. Food was fresh and hot so that was the only good thing. I suggest using the drive through if anything at all.<//Text><GmapID>0x808f874ac95f8049:0x79a4e3154a991f89<//GmapID>< username>

It's MCD people.. salty A food and drive through is a joke no matter where you go. Why on earth at the busiest time you got one person working all windows? Catch  me off here an I'll give you the real deal. The MCD on Jackson don't try it early or later if you're in a hurry.< /review>

NOT open 24 hr daily. I went at 2am Tuesday and it was closed at the location listed

wanted to 'suggest as edit' on gmaps profile but idk what their hours actually are.

review stars are just so that I can post, if i could i would leave a suggestion without star-rating it</text>

This is the worst mc donalds i have ever seen. If the person cannot afford to keep employees than you should change your business. Anytime you come at night. When they get 3 or 4 cars in line. The employees raise hand and be like we are closed. So rude. Atleast you can mention we are closing it for 10 15 mins for cleaniness. Seriously man , hats off to this type of bad management. Atleast show some respect , its a big shame for mcdonalds franchise which is known and famous world wide for its service.<//text>

< Review>
The door clearly says they close at 9PM but multiple times I have gone there b/w 8-9 PM and the dining area is closed. Asked the staff and they are just rude and say they dont have any one working the registers so they closed. That does not make sense since the drive thru is still open. Just change the dining area closing time or stay open till the posted time. I rather go to the fast food place a few blocks away rather than deal with this BS.< /Review>

McDonald's at its best. The staff cares about their customers, there's a self-service kiosk, you have to ask for ketchup packets, and there are bathrooms.</Text>

<Review>You know I love places that have a free Wifi, but then I hate those places with free Wifi but won't let you stay long enough to use it. Well this is the best of both worlds. This Micky D's doesn't rush you and you might not look at McDonald's as a place that has that family feeling, you thought wrong. Must of the customers they know by sight alot they know by name.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The drive through is full of homeless people harassing you outsider of your car asking you to order food for them. They don't take no for an answer. The manager and or owner does nothing to have these people removed. Fast food is already over priced, they should invest in private security. I don't plan on returning to this place.</text>

If ever I'm in the mood for McDonald's I only go here because the food is freshly cooked and hot. This place is always busy if you have the time to wait or you can easily go through the drive thru. I have experiencd great customer service every time!</Text>

I use the drive thru when I come here since going inside gets crowded. The line to the drive thru kinda sucks because you wait on the street and you're at the intersection lights. So cars have to swerve to the left.</Text>

My friendly neighborhood Mickey D's😎The food is usually fresh and the staff is really pleasant. I live right down the street, so it's great for late night munchies and even better for when you have that craving for a soft serve 🍦✌🏽👍🏽</Text>

<Review>Was in the other day and the staff was not friendly and very unprofessional! The place is always busy but the attitude in there is unbelievable! Its unsanitary too the security guard came from the lobby touching the door handles and tables goes to the back and starts to replenish the cups and their tops!! Ewww! We have to drink from those sir! No gloves on anyone there! Not my first non-pleasant experience but the worse one.. They need all new staff and a manager that follows standards. They also poured my coffee while they were waiting on my order so I get it and its warm - I saw it sitting there for a while so when my order came I asked for another cup of coffee actually 2 cups and she got snippy and said "I just made it" maybe so but you poured it a while ago and its cooled down now can you pour us some hot coffee? Thank you and I had to ask twice for cream and sugar. Won't be going back its been one-time too many for mediocre service..< /Review>< Time>

Small Mickey D's. Only one in this part of town. Closes at about 9pm. I believe the drive-thru is 24hrs. Right across the street from the Post Office.<//Review>

It is a decent McDonald's.
Although I have not visited the restrooms second-hand knowledge informs me that it's best to avoid them but that goes for most McDonald's.<//Text>

Food is OK. McDonald's menu almost never changes. I like their Gilroy garlic fries - only if you don't mind them soggy after they are soaked in garlic and cheese.
There are two issues with this place:
1. There are only eight or so parking spots in the lot. Once full you'll be feeding the meters on the streets. Since this is near downtown it'll be almost impossible to find a spot. And if you find a spot you'll be adding $3-6 to your cheap McDonald's meal.
2. Lot's and lots of transient people hanging around the area. It can be dangerous. One time I was taking a picture of the nearby post office. A guy threatened to beat me up because he thought I was taking his picture.</Text>

Make sure you have everything in your bag before you leave the window because on several different occasions we have returned home and not have at least one thing that we ordered also the last time we went the printer was not working and so we cannot get our receipt which I think I was overcharged on this particular day and as far as cleaning the bathroom is not clean !</Review>

<text>This Mackers is old skool. It's been there forever, almost since way back when, a time long ago Mickey D's was cool, there was a child loving clown mascot named Ronald McDonald, and a semi hapless batmanlike evil villain hell bent on stealing your burgers... ah those where the days. 128oz of coke, 20 mcnuggets, bigmac with cheese and fries. Mmmmm fries..    oh and to be health conscious our parents would get a salad  with thousand island... and maybe a diet super 128oz coke hahaha< /text>< response>

This suppose to be a fast food drive thru! It's more like a formal restaurant it takes so long to order and recieve. This McDonalds must not ever get mystery shoppers or anyone from corporate. This location needs speed up the process period also this IS NOT A 24 HR LOCATION that's false I've been turned away at 12am before!</Review>

The inside of the restaurant turns into homeless encampment as soon as the sun goes down.  It's the second fast food restaurant I've ever seen that had a security guard (Sorry McDonald's, the SF Civic Center Carl's Jr. beat you to that one).  While I was paying for my food, I had one guy come up and ask for money, and another repeatedly ask me to buy him food.

On another occasion, I went to the drive thru, thinking it would be better, but no, you get panhandlers coming up to your window while you're penned in by other cars.

The only reason I gave it two stars is because the service is fast and the food is the same as any other McDonald's.<//review><UserId.>113510481991588713457</UserId.><Date>1389759595916<//Date>< username>

Not 24 hours, went here 3:30 am on a Friday morning. Saw 1 person inside, so I decided to order. I waited 5 minutes at the order window. Nothing, no one came, no one was at any of the windows. He was the only person I saw, he wasn't taking orders so no this isn't 24 hours. The west Oakland (7th St), the east Oakland  (e. 12th st) and north Oakland  (Telegraph) are all 24 hours. Don't waste your time here.< /Review>

Horrible customer service. Every time I go in there they pretend like they cannot hear you or see you when you try to grab their attention. And when you do get their attention and complain they act like everything is still okay. I just picked up an order that was cold and nasty. Unfortunately I watched my order sit there for five minutes before it was given to me. My soda has a disgusting taste to it and I'm forced to throw it away. They really don't seem to care about their customer service in the Drive-Thru. I wish I can go back and complain right now but because of their slow pace I'm late for work<//text>

The location is ok , in comparison to mc donalds on san pablo leaving emeryville , jackson st could stand to step there freshness game up, but Oh my god Mc donalds has stepped there game up with the bew never frozen fresh beef . The bbq smoke house burger should be the standard for all fast food burger places. Seriously up there with five guys , just the new burgers though.<//review>

If you like to wait for the one cashier to take your order this is the place, also pay close attention to the menu price and what your actually charged , they post one price but charge another with not so much as a sorry</review>

I came in a group of four for brunch on a Sunday just after 11am, and we were (perhaps surprisingly) seated inside right away! The servers here were all so nice and attentive, and the posters surrounding the dining room made for a really pleasant setting to dine.</Text>< pics>

When you have an open time of 5 a.m., you need to open on time so busy people with time scheldules can go on about their day.  5 mins? Ok. Over half an hour?! Not cool.<//Text>

I've been here as a customer and an Uber eats driver.. both bad experiences.

As a customer.. food just does not taste great. It matches the sad expression /interaction I've had every time with the employees.

As an Uber eats driver picking up food... They are rude. Not even a "second window please". This last visit I approached the second window for them to say it's going to be a min" and then shut the window. Didn't even say to pull off to the side... Causing a big line of people to wait for their food as well.. did i mention.. I was only waiting for a 6 piece chicken nugget meal??? SMH< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><resp>None< /resp><review>It's been awhile since I came here, since it's by my daughter's school..

This morning, an elderly couple and their daughter accidentally spill a hot cup of water and a cup of oj, the staff here were quick to mop the floor, cleaned it up, wiped down the tables/ chairs, the manager was quick and happy to give the elderly couple a fresh cup of oj and a cup hot water..

I've been to different McDonald's and their clean-ups are usually slow, like no one wants to do it, but this location, they keep it clean by wiping the tables clean for the next customer, mops the floor, constantly changing the trash cans...

Although this location can be ghetto at times, the staff here are very hard workers, I've seen crazy stuff happen here...lol sometimes they just don't get the credit they deserved..

Sometimes it gets so busy here and chaotic, but they manage to smile and say Thank you! Super friendly service here!!!!<//review>< Time>

<review>Some McDonald's have dirty stores, and this one was filthy inside, and I refused the restroom. They had customers still, and the food was prepped correctly, but it was a large indoor seating store with an empty outdoor flagpole, and it was the trash and garbage inside that turned me off from this location.<//review>< UserId.>

1. All the employees are Mexico.
2. Only one black person work, at McDonald's on Jackson.
3. In she a rude individuals too.
4. Poor people's stay inside, to the McDonald's, employees get theme out, at the end of the day.
5. The cleaning is not the part. Meaning the bathroom,floor,etc.< /review>

Arrived at 850 on foot doors were locked.  Signs posted say open till 9.  Internet says 9. People inside still ordering, yet would not let 3 of us in.  False advertisements and bad service.<//Text>

< Review>
They advertise that they're open 24 hours yet when I got there the dining room was closed therefore I had to stand outside for 20 minutes in the cold while they opened I know McDonald's are notorious for not posting dining room hours so I was on the phone calling them the whole way over and nobody answered if you're going to post a phone number you should at least pick up</Review>
