I came by the office to reserve my unit, I was able to pay for it. I’m very impressed with the service, the staff is friendly and helpful. I’d recommend this place to anyone interested in renting a storage unit.</review>

I can sum it up easily... this storage and the people are awesome. Area is always tidy, people are
so patient and pleasant, plus there's never been a problem when I make a payment. (no on line glitches or when I go in to payment). What more could you ask for?< /text>

<Review>(Update to my previous post): I'm very disappointed at this point. I have tried on numerous occasions to reach someone via different platforms, a bunch recently, but also throughout the year. Not even once, have they tried to return my call. Although happy with my secured storage needs, I strongly believe customer service is an important component of the overall negotiation experience between a customer and a business. It should not be that you are treated like an important person just before you sign on the dotted line, then you are no longer important once a customer is comited to a plan. Wouldn't you agree?
(Old post): I need to store lots of furniture for a short period. I was happy to find a place close to home that is well kept, good prices, and friendly staff. Also, they happened to have a promo saving me a little cash, and they have different promo's from time to time, so just have to look and have some luck. I got one of the big rooms, a 10x20 and fit a good amount of about 3 house rooms (Bdr, living room, dining room) and some garage stuff. You do have to get a specific lock, the "disc" lock. Wish I could have used mine yet I can see how the disc lock is a safer security. Thus, I recommend this place for your storage needs.< /Review>< Pics>

The people that run the place are very nice. I have got locked in there twice and there were nice about it. Good place to rent a storage.                                   I though that at this time of need people are helping people.  My storage was due May 1st.you have 10 days before late fees. I called and asked if they could help they said no. I told them that I had not  received anything funds, my last check was the second week of March. So I asked if I could drop it off the follwing day May 10th I told her why, she said they would me closed and I would get charged the late fee.I had 15mins to go borrow money and drop it off so they would not change me late the late fees.  I was in Ontario almost had a accident.<//text>

Would not honor their advertised special.  Do not store here.

To the owner who sent a response.  I have contacted your property and your District Manager Luz (?).  They are unwilling to even talk about the problems which are bait and switch and illegally overlocking a unit.  I asked for the name of Luz's boss, so I could talk to them and was refused.  Obviously, your employees are not interested in customer service.  I advise anybody reading this to go somewhere else.

To management.  Your ad states "$29.99 First Month Rent + Free Truck & Driver!*.  What you are saying is that if somebody moves in on the 1st of a month, they will get 30 to 31 days for $29.99 and if somebody moves in on the 31st of a month, they will get ONE!  Your definition of a month is not explained in your ad.  Since your asterisk is after free truck and driver, most will assume it is IF the truck and driver are available (I did not need a truck so I did not care).  Additionally, your Property Manager forced me to sign up for insurance when I specifically told her I did not want it.  She assured me that it was no extra cost.  Just another LIE.  RUN away from this Company, there are literally hundreds of other facilities that will not pull a bait and switch.< /Text>

< Review>
I rented this pace for over a year and was in and out of it most of the time. I had everything nicely packed in there and everything was labeled.I'm VERY neat.  When I went in to close my storage because I found a place to move into my mattress (which was clear plastic covered) in the back had rat poop and wholes in it and boxes were chewed through and rat poop everywhere. I conplained to the owner and manager and they only gave me $1,000 for all my damaged property and said sorry. I was sooo soooo MAD!!<//Review>

While we do preventative pest maintenance monthly, incidents like this do happen from time to time. This is why we strongly encourage all tenants to participate in a protection or insurance plan, so in the unlikely event something happens you can be reimbursed for the value of the damaged items in your unit. The plans we offer on-site include $2000, $3000, and $5000 in protection. (This store does not offer $1000 pay outs. Unless this incident happened prior to September, which is when we took over ownership.) If you have homeowner’s insurance it is worth looking into that policy as well since many of them cover items in a storage unit.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>I think the place is clean. The prices are a bit high, but the bothersome part is they have so many cars blocking the first row. It is hard to maneuver down the at row if anyone is there.<//Review>< Pics>

I don't know about other lawyers, but if you do go to this place for legal help, DO NOT GO TO EMMA.
I been contacting her about the status of my case, she always avoid my point and response a unclear answer. She took forever to response my question.

NOT PROFESSIONAL.

Be aware.< /Review>

I am very satisfied with their help. Because I was cheated by the second landlord  for renting the warehouse, the owner took me to  court for eviction. The attorney Mr. Howard is professional and enthusiastic. He only took one day to settle the dispute and got a good deal. Also General Manager, Willian Livingston, is so nice and patient. He carefully analyzed my case and gave effective and clear suggestions. And after the event was resolved, he still followed up to provide information and help for  leasing of a warehouse. They not only charge a reasonable fee but also serve excellent quality.<//Review>

<text>I was seeking restraining order and prepared all material myself in the beginning. Later I was very worried for the hearing but Anna Demidchik Law Firm helped me out and my restraining order was finally granted. They offered high quality consultation for restraining order. Lin was in charge of my case, she is quite responsible and always responded quickly and tried her best to help me allocate the best resources in the law firm to increase the chance of wining in the hearing.  My attorney was D. Garth Sullivan. He is a very nice gentlemen who cares about the client and willing to listen. He spent a lot time with me going over every details in my case and offered detailed suggestions. He put all his efforts in resolving the problem from the perspective of the client, not only considering increasing the wining chance in the court but also seeking all potentially helpful solutions. He is well prepared. He helped me check all required materials are correctly filed and nothing is missed. He is also quite professional in the hearing. He kept on discussing my case with me and even refining material during lunch time. Hearing was a tough experience for me but with him accompanying me and protecting me, I feel secured and supported. He spent the whole day in the court with me and stayed focused and patient. I really appreciate all his help and efforts in my case. If you are looking for an attorney for restraining order, I would like to strongly recommend him.</text><Response>None<//Response>< date>

In a nutshell, they saved my wife from being deported back to China.  Garth and Leo are professional, honest (imagine that), reliable, effective, and efficient.  I give them my highest recommendation.

I am U.S. Citizen, born and raised.  My wife had a relatively simple case of misrepresentation on her I-485.  Our prior two attorneys really messed things up.  As a result, the case became extremely complicated, ongoing for close to 4 years.  The situation got so bad, we had to find a new attorney, our third.  Enter Garth and Leo of Demidchik Law; they got to the root of the problem, corrected a few critical errors and omissions.  My wife’s master hearing was last week, and her I-485 was granted.  Now my wife and I can go on and live our American Dream.

Thank you Garth and Leo!

If you have an immigration question or problem, your status is pending, or your current lawyer is just not making progress, I highly suggest you give Garth a call.  If you need a Chinese translator, ask for Leo.  Do not wait until it is too late.

Stay safe and best wishes to you all in these crazy times.</Text>< user>

<review>I went to the law office for advice on a problem with my business partner. I met with Howard. He was so nice and smart. He understood my problem and gave me great advice. His assistant told me he has been practicing 40 years. It shows. When I left he even gave me a present from under their Christmas tree. I cannot remember when I was ever treated so well.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

我对这里的服务很满意。首先收费很合理，并且办事效率也很快，我的案件等了很多年，换到他们事务所很快就办好了。我的律师Garth和他的助理Rachel还有另一位ally非常细心耐心周到，服务态度非常好，问问题都及时回复，业务能力强，最后给我办的结果非常成功。我非常感谢他们。<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) Curious about where so many good reviews come from? ! Based on my personal experience, based on the premise of seeking truth from facts and objective, I really think that this law firm needs improvement in handling issues and fees. When paying the money, I said everything well and agreed. The next day after you have paid the money, you will contact the person responsible for communication and collection through information, and you will no longer reply to any information. Then I can only start a long phone call to the front desk to consult the progress. From the good four or five days to one month, every time I have a good attitude, I also said that the person in charge is not there or is processing, and I asked if I need to provide details for the lawyer's reference. Answer The lawyer will contact you when you need it, and after more than a month has passed, you will suddenly tell you that it can't be done for various reasons. Before I asked, I asked again and again whether I need to know the details for the lawyer's reference. Why did no one care about me? I can't do it now and I said because I don't know the details. If you can't do it, then forget it, can you always refund the money I paid before? When I took out the bill, I could see that I was professional. Even if I called to ask about the progress, I was also billed. There was very little money left, which meant that the money had to be collected if it was not done. In the end, an extra $100 was refunded through negotiations. This kind of fairness and justice, I can understand the justice! I don’t want to induce anything. I just told a true story. Just be fair and comfortable.

好奇那么多的好评是从何而来？！就本人亲身体验，本着实事求是客观的前提，真的认为这家律师楼在处理问题和收费上有待改进。交钱的时候什么都说的很好也都答应。等交了钱的第二天再通过信息联系前期负责沟通和收款的人，就不再回复任何信息了。然后只能开始漫长的打电话到前台咨询进度，从说好的四五天到一个月，每次都态度好，也都说负责人不在或者正在办理，问是否需要提供细节以便律师参考，答律师会在需要时联系您，到最后一个多月过去了突然告诉办不了因为种种原因。问之前我再三的问是否需要了解细节以便律师参考，为什么没人理我？现在办不了又说因为不了解细节。办不了就算了，我之前交的钱总可以退给我吧？账单一拿出来就看出专业了，包括我打过去电话询问进展也被计费，左扣右扣交的钱所剩无几，等于事没办成钱要照收。通过交涉最后多退了$100.这样的公平公正，主持正义我算领教了！我不想去诱导什么，只是讲述了一个真实的小故事，公道自在人心吧<//review>< Date>

(Translated by Google) First of all, I am very grateful to Assistant Tom, who helped me find a very professional local counsel who solved the case very smoothly. The degree of difficulty of the case varies from person to person, but it was originally expected that the result would only take a month, and the case would be closed in two weeks. At the same time, I am very grateful to the front desk customer service. I have been anxiously waiting for news and talked to the front desk many times, and the front desk was very patient. The reason why I didn’t give full marks was because, like other low-scoring reviews, I encountered some irritating experiences in communication, so that I once doubted the professional ability of the law firm. It has to be said that although the results prove the excellent professionalism of the law firm, the confusion of communication with clients also exposes management problems to a certain extent. Hope the law firm can pay attention to smooth communication and transparent information.

首先非常感谢助理Tom，帮我找到了一位非常专业的local counsel非常顺利的解决了案件。案件难易程度因人而异，但本来预计一个月才有结果，两个星期就结案了。同时非常感谢前台客服，我有多次焦急的等待消息与前台通话，前台都非常耐心。之所以没有给满分也是因为我与其他低分评论一样，遇到了一些沟通上让人恼火的经历，以至于一度怀疑律所的专业能力。不得不说，虽然结果证明律所出色的专业度，与客户沟通的混乱一定程度上也暴露出管理上的问题。希望律所能注意沟通通畅和信息透明。</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very responsible, dedicated, and patient. Do your best to solve the problem for the client and find a way. When I presented the situation, I was emotionally unstable and shed tears. An elderly lawyer found me some information about a mediator and said that as an elderly person, not a lawyer, he came to advise me and hoped that I would remedy it instead of Make a decision. The beauty in charge of my case was also very enthusiastic, and she explained every step very seriously. I was careless and had poor English. I asked her many details about some details, and she took the trouble to tell me. This is a very, very small case. I went there N times, but I was warmly received every time, and I did not wait too long. I changed my time twice, and they all took time to receive it without any discomfort. I withdrew the case and offered to return the money to me. Later, there was an issue, Emma and another senior lawyer discussed for a long time. Finally found a solution. I really appreciate it! Because this matter is very important to me. I really don't know how to be grateful! thank you very much!

(Original)
非常负责、敬业，且耐心。尽其所能的为案主解决问题，想办法。我陈述情况的时候情绪不稳，掉了眼泪，一位年长的律师给我找了一些调解员的资料，说他作为长者，而非律师来给我建议，希望我去补救，而不是做决断。负责我案子的美女也十分热心，很认真的把每一步都交待清楚，我粗心，且英语不好，有些细节问她很多次，她都不厌其烦的告诉我。我这个算是非常非常小的小案子，去了N趟，但每次都得到热心的接待，没有让我等过太久。我时间改过两次，他们都抽时间接待，没有任何的不悦。我撤了案子也主动说退钱给我。后来有一个事情，Emma和另一个资深律师，商讨了很久。最终找到了解决办法。我真的非常感谢！因为这件事对我至关重要。真的不知道如何感激！非常感谢！</review>

(Translated by Google) Personal experience They are incomplete and unavailable, contracts cannot protect customers, and there are separate charges hidden at the top and bottom. Note that they don't explain the contract to the customer, it's not very professional! They just charge money to do things and ignore customer service! If you still want to give a chance, your attitude will change 180 degrees after you receive the money! Heads up!

<text>(Translated by Google) My wife and I met a lawyer for the first time. After the phone consultation, Assistant Hu made an appointment for us to meet Tony at 3:30 pm in San Gabriel's office in Los Angeles. After a while, Aria phoned me to confirm the appointment time, telling us the free consultation time is 15 minutes, and will tell us in advance if we need to pay. We arrived less than three o'clock. During our waiting period, it was stated several times that the lawyer had a client and needed to wait. Of course, we knew that we had arrived early.

It turned out that Tony was the head of the office. He briefly asked about our situation, and arranged for lawyers Rami Kayyali and D. Garth Sullivan to receive us, and Emma (Honglei Yang) helped with Chinese translation.

According to our situation, attorney D. Garth Sullivan gave specific opinions and arrangements. The whole process presented us with professional, sincere and rigorous. We hope to use lawyers to help us determine a legally based plan to deal with the problem. Lawyer D. Garth Sullivan's answer completely solves our doubts. We are very grateful, in addition to professional advice, from the first assistant Hu who received the phone call, then Aria who confirmed the appointment time with us, then Tony, then lawyer Rami Kayyali and lawyer D. Garth Sullivan and Emma (Honglei Yang), The whole process is very orderly. While we were waiting, we saw constant customer exchanges. Everyone who received us made people feel safe and reliable. We are willing to recommend friends to contact this law firm when they need help from a lawyer.

我和太太第一次接触律师。电话咨询后，胡助理帮我们约好了和Tony见面的时间是下午3点半在洛杉矶San Gabriel的办公室。过了一会儿Aria电话和我确认了约见的时间，告诉我们免费咨询时间15分钟，如果需要付费会事先告诉我们。我们不到三点就到了，在我们等候期间几次说明律师有客人需要再等一下，我们当然知道是我们提前到了。

原来Tony是办公室主任，简单问了一下我们的情况，然后安排了Rami Kayyali律师和D. Garth Sullivan律师接待我们，Emma (Honglei Yang)帮助做中文翻译。

根据我们的情况，D. Garth Sullivan律师给出了具体的意见和安排，整个过程中呈现给我们的是专业诚恳严谨。我们希望通过律师帮助我们确定有法律依据的面对处理问题的方案，D. Garth Sullivan律师的答复完全解决我们的疑问。我们很感谢，除了专业上的意见，从最初电话接待的胡助理，然后是和我们确认约见时间的Aria，后来是Tony，然后是Rami Kayyali律师和D. Garth Sullivan律师和Emma (Honglei Yang)，整个过程很有秩序。我们等候期间看到客户来往不断。接待我们的每个人都是让人感到安稳可以信赖。我们愿意推荐朋友有需要律师帮助的时候联系这家律师楼。</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I think it is necessary to write a good comment and thank you. I called the phone in the middle of the night. Because it was an emergency, I searched for a lawyer. I saw that it was 24 hours a day. After I tried it, I didn't expect someone to answer it. I could speak Chinese, saying that I could handle any urgent matter. Then I entrusted them. My wife's case was handled very well. She was wronged by the police. Passers-by in the United States called the police if they didn't know anything about it. I spent a small amount of money in the lawyer's office, and I expected two or three court sessions, but I didn't expect that one court appearance would be completely cancelled. Thanks to the staff, Attorney Li and Attorney Cohen.

我觉得是有必要写个好评感谢一下的。我是半夜打的电话，由于是急事，就搜了一下律师，看到这个是24小时的，打了试了一下没想到也有人接，可以讲中文，说是可以处理任何紧急事情。然后我就委托他们了。我老婆的案子办的很不错，本来她就是被警察冤枉的，美国的路人什么事情都搞不清楚就报警。在律师楼花了点小钱，本来预期两三次开庭，没想到一次出庭就完全撤销掉了。感谢一下工作人员，李律师和科恩律师。<//review>

(Translated by Google) Their routine is to attract you at a price slightly lower than the market price. You will be refunded after 10 hours. Although I didn’t expect the money to be refunded at the time. I had prepared all the materials, so I could ask for a hearing. Yes, I found it here to be safe. I charged the consultation fee and read the information. Tell me that the winning side is great. I sent a person named Rami to me, and my nightmare began. They have not yet officially exchanged with each other The materials told me to pay the money in the past, and 10 hours were used up. At that time, you had boarded the thief ship and could not get off. Pay the money again. The damn thing is that my handful of evidence was defeated by them, and the hearing was only given. One opportunity can be a correction request. They actually said that your judgment came out, and the case was closed. There is an additional charge for writing letters. There is no professional ethics. I regret it, and if I fight the worst result myself, it will be nothing more than that. The lawyer’s problem is that he gave the materials to the other’s lawyer before the time to exchange the materials. The materials were not focused. He sent out 100 pages of the materials I gave him like a running account. The hearing officer did not look at it well. Everyone must Choose carefully.

(Original)
他们的套路是以比市场价格略低的价格吸引你.10个小时用不完还会退钱给你.当时虽不指望退回来钱.因材料自己都准备好了，我本来可以自己打听证会的，为了稳妥还是找了这里.收了咨询费，看了资料.告诉我赢面很大.派了位叫Rami 的给我，我的恶梦就开始了.他们还没到正式和对方交换材料就通知我过去补交钱，10个小时用完了，那时你已上了贼船，下不来了.再交钱.可恶的是我满手的证据被他们打输了，听证会给了唯一一次机会可以correction request. 他们居然说你的判断出来了，就结案了.写信要另外收费😓没有一点职业道德.后悔死了，我如果自己打最坏的结果也不过如此了。律师的问题在于：没到交换材料的时候他早早把材料给了对方律师.材料没有重点，他把我给他的材料像流水账一样发了一百页.听证官根本没有好好看.大家一定要慎重选择.</review>

(Translated by Google) The initial consultation between lawyer Rami Kayyali and his assistant, Miss Zhang, showed sincerity and professionalism. I originally thought that the money Lao Lai owed our company was not so easy to recover. Now there are good lawyers from Anna Law Firm to design plans completely from the client's standpoint. I chose them without hesitation! I believe there will be satisfactory results soon.

Rami Kayyali律师和他助理张小姐的初次咨询就体现出了真诚、专业。本来我以为老赖欠我们公司款项不那么容易追回。现在有了安娜律师楼的好律师完全站在委托人立场上设计方案。我毫不犹豫地选择了他们！相信很快会有满意的结果。</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) This TM is a lawyer's house, which is a group of organized and disciplinary mobile scammers. Honesty is written in the contract. What fairness, justice, and human rights are not to be troubled. Fairy tales are deceiving. I just need to adjust my mentality. Don't be too real. The more you know, the harder you hit the face. I have personally experienced it and ensured it is true. All the opinions represent my personal opinions. The lawyer I found in November 2018 was in dispute over a car contract. At that time, the lawyer said that I could go to the arbitral tribunal and help me get back more than 10,000 losses. It took up to 6 months. The cost included the first 200 and the arbitration materials $ 350 / h I paid a total of $ 2500, and I started to slap. I naively thought that I could get compensation after 6 months. There are still many good people in the world. . SB. . . Today February 2020. . . Someone contacted you for six months from the first payment. Okay, I'll go to you. The address is still that address, the room is still the room, the decoration is the decoration, is the staff changed a batch, so amazing? The intermediate process is not described, the key point is that for more than a year, the first arbitral tribunal has not been opened. The lawyer and assistant who took my case changed 4 people. Every time I want to ask about the progress of the case, I will call and tell you about the lawyer. No longer quit, who is taking your case now, and then ask you the case again, my dear mother, this money is worth the money, this is the money to ask the lawyers to stage a live stool. The fluidity of the staff of the law firm cannot be simply said to be large, it is really JB, what kind of law firm is simply a small theater, serving

(Original)
这TM哪是律师楼，就是一帮有组织有纪律的流动骗子，诚信都写在合同里了，什么公平正义人权别闹了，童话里都是骗人的，希望越大失望就越大，还是调整好心态差不多就得了，别太较真了，知道的越多脸打的越狠，我亲身体验过，保证真实，所有言论谨代表个人意见。2018年11月找的律师，买车合同纠纷，当时律师说可以上仲裁庭，能帮我要回来一万多损失，最多用时6个月，费用算上第一次200和整理仲裁材料$350/h我总付了$2500，好了开始打脸了，我天真以为6个月以后我可以拿到赔偿，人间有真情好人还是多啊。。SB。。。今天2020年2月。。。从第一次付钱半年么人联系你，好吧我去找你吧，地址还是那个地址，房间还是那个房间，装修还是那个装修，就是工作人员换了一批，这么神奇？中间过程不描述了，重点，1年多了连第一次仲裁庭都没开，接我案子的律师和助理换了4波人，每次想问案子进展打电话过去就说你找的律师不再了不干了现在谁谁谁接你的案子，然后在重新问你一边案情，我的个亲娘啊，这钱花的值啊，这是花钱请律师楼集体上演大便活人，这律师楼的工作人员流动性那不能简单的说大，那是真JB大啊，这什么律师楼简直就是小剧场，服了</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) He is only an intermediary here. When he goes there, there will be a beautiful receptionist, and then he will pay the fee to see the lawyer. No matter what case they will accept, they will pay the money to see the lawyer. See you. Attorney fees, they are casually shouting, the total sentence is very pit, maybe you pay 1500 ~ 2000 just to see the cost of the welcome beauty! If you feel expensive, they will put up a very high posture and say that you will go. In general, no matter whether your case is big or small, they will pick it up. Anyway, if they receive money, they will not help you solve the problem. So, if you feel unsure, don’t go, just look for them with a little grasp, otherwise the money will be paid in time.

(Original)
他这里只是个中介，去到里面都是会有个美女迎宾会接待，然后说了要交了费用才可以见律师，不管什么案子他们会接都是说交了钱才可以见律师，见律师费用他们是随便乱喊价，总之一句话很坑，也许你付了1500～2000只是见迎宾美女的费用吧！如果你觉得贵，他们会摆出很高昂的姿态说你走吧，总之一句话不管你的案子或者是大还是小他们都会接，反正收了钱他们这个中介律师楼也不一定帮你解决事情，所以大家要是觉得没把握的事情就不要去了，有点把握的才去找他们，不然钱就白交了< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I asked Garth to help me apply for immigration. I didn't know my situation before I could apply for a green card, but Garth and his assistants were very responsible and patiently helped me to do the case well. I am very happy to get a green card now. My own case was done in New York. Later I heard that Anna Law Firm also has an office in Los Angeles and recommended my friend to come here. His case was successfully approved, and he can apply for a formal green card in another year. Thank you for your hard work and dedication, thank you!

我是请Garth律师帮我申请移民的。之前不知道我的情况还可以申请绿卡，但是Garth律师和他的助理都很负责，很耐心地帮助我把案子办的很好。我现在很开心能拿到了绿卡。我自己的案子是在纽约做的，后来听说安娜律师楼在洛杉矶也有办公室，就推荐我的朋友来这里办。他的案子也成功批准了，再等一年就可以申请正式绿卡了。感谢你们的努力和付出，谢谢你们！<//Text>

It didn't feel very good. Then after a friend introduced to the Anna Law Firm, garth did very much. Careful, training is also in place, the assistants are also very active, the translation also gave me a lot of help in the training, the translation is very accurate, and then the case was successfully approved. Later, my family had another case, which was handled by the lawrence lawyer of Anna Law Firm. The lawrence lawyer was very experienced, the person was very good, and the case ended very well. I recently introduced a friend who went to the Los Angeles office to consult. Although I can't do the case in time, the staff at the Los Angeles office patiently and patiently told the case to my friend. Thanks again for the help of Anna Law Firm.

我和我家人的案件都是在这里做的，移民是garth律师帮我做的，之前案件在别的律师楼做的，感觉不是很好，然后经过朋友介绍到了安娜律师楼，garth做案件非常细心，培训也很到位，助理办事情也很积极，翻译在培训的时候也给了我很大的帮助，翻译的很精准，然后案子顺利批准。后来我家人又有了另一个案件，是安娜律师楼的lawrence律师处理的，lawrence律师很有经验，人非常好，案件也结束的很好。我最近介绍了一个我的朋友去洛杉矶办公室咨询，虽然现在还不到时间可以做案子，但是洛杉矶办公室的工作人员也很耐心负责的给我朋友讲了案件。再次感谢安娜律师楼的帮助。< /Text></record>

(Translated by Google) Anna Law Firm helped me and my daughter to apply for political success in less than a year after coming to the United States. I told everyone with my personal experience that Anna Law Firm is the most professional. I am especially grateful to Susan Qin, who is my nephew. Her accurate analysis, positioning and operation of my case are the key to success. Thanks to the immigration lawyer assistant Leo, who has helped me with patience. Thanks to my interview lawyer Monica. With her encouragement and guidance, I was able to do nothing in the interviews, no mistakes, and true feelings. In the end, my experience completely touched the interviewer. Imagine that the interviewer was red-eyed and gave me a paper towel to wipe my tears. , continue to comfort me, but also wipe the tears of paper towels to myself... This way, it is difficult to pass!
I sincerely thank Anna Lawyer, the two of us are so fast that we don’t have to travel hard on the long road of seeking identity! Thanks, thank you, 🙏🙏🙏

安娜律师楼帮我和我女儿在来美不到一年的时间里，就申请政庇成功。我以我的亲身经历告诉大家，安娜律师楼是最专业的。特别感谢接我䅁子的Susan Qin律师，她对我案子的精准分析、定位，运作是成功的关键；感谢移民律师助理Leo，事无巨细，都耐心帮助我；感谢我的面谈律师Monica，有她的鼓励和指导，我才能在面谈时做到不卑不亢，毫无纰漏，而且真情流露，最终我的经历完全感动了面谈官，试想一下，面谈官红着眼圈，给我递纸巾让我擦眼泪，不断安慰我，也抽纸巾给自己擦眼泪的情景……这样子，不通过也难吧！
衷心感谢安娜律师楼，我俩娘俩这么快就不用在求身份的漫漫长路上艰难跋涉了！感谢感谢感谢🙏🙏🙏< /review>

I am worried that I can't fully understand what American lawyers are saying, so I want to find a place to provide Chinese services. Here you can consult a US lawyer to find a US law firm and provide full translation. I have invited them. I have been observing for two months. All the services are fine. It makes sense. The case is almost finished, praise!

<Time>1558019740985<//Time><rate>5</rate><Text>(Translated by Google) I have consulted many law firms before, and they all said that my case is too difficult to do, and I can find someone else. In fact, my case is due to the misunderstanding of the criminal law, which may affect the immigration status, so it may be more complicated. I finally found Anna Law Firm. The lawyers Qin and Jonathan at the Law Firm made me feel very kind. I was relieved, said the strategy of handling the case, and I will do my best to help me. I later communicated with Jonathan, who eventually persuaded the judge to remove the case. Under the guidance of Qin, my green card was also saved. Every day, I was worried about it every day. I was worried that one day I was canceled by the green card and deported. Now I can finally relieve myself. There can be no luck in the future. Eat a bit, grow a wisdom

(Original)
之前咨询过很多律所，他们都说我的案件太难办、办不成，让我找别人。其实我的案件是由于一时糊涂触犯了刑法的轻罪，有可能会影响的移民身份，所以可能比较复杂。我最终找到安娜律师楼，律师楼的秦律师和Jonathan律师让我感觉很亲切，让我放心，说了办案的策略，而且会竭尽全力帮我。我后来跟Jonathan沟通，他们最终说服法官把案件给撤掉。在秦律师的指导下，我的绿卡也保住了。前些日子每天都惶恐不安，担心有一天被取消绿卡，递解出境，现在终于可以如释重负。今后再也不能有侥幸心理。吃一堑，长一智啊< /Text>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) The H1b work visa that was handled in other law firms was supplemented by the RFE. It did not have much hope and it would not pass. I want to come to Anna Law Firm to try my luck. I didn't expect paul Song to actively communicate with me, explain every detail to me, and encourage me as a friend. I just learned that the H1b patch passed. thank you very much.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Never go to this lawyer's office! The Chinese are definitely cheating the Chinese. No matter what you do, sit down and wait for you to finish talking and start charging you. Asking for a consultation fee of 150, without telling you anything, "If you say you need a professional lawyer to answer, then you will be charged."
I asked their manager and said: Your law firm does not give us any information, procedures, processing methods, etc. It is unreasonable for customers to start charging before they are sure to cooperate with you, right?
The manager said that you are embarrassed to go
It's so irritating! I have been there twice, and every time I ask you for money before starting, don't go!

(Original)
千万千万不要去这个律师楼！ 绝对是中国人坑中国人的，不管你什么事情坐下等你说完就开始跟你收费。要150的咨询费，什么也不告诉你，“说需要专业律师回答然后就要收费。”
我找他们经理说：你们律师楼什么信息也不给我们、流程、处理方式等等，客人在确定跟你们合作之前就开始收费是不合理的吧？
他们经理说那不好意思你走吧

{'time': 1557446444052, 'text': '1. We have a team of experienced and knowledgeable lawyers here at Demidchik Law Firm. The consultation fee for each case is dependent on each client’s needs and we will charge accordingly.

(Translated by Google) Say a good free consultation to drive for 2 hours from sd to say that you have to charge 200 to the consulting fee.

(Translated by Google) This law firm is a liar company, especially for immigrants who have just arrived from the country. Before paying the money, the rhetoric, all kinds of guarantees, boasting, waiting for you to pay the money, immediately is another face, you The case can be luck, and if you can't pass it, you will push all your responsibilities to you. There is no professional ethics. If you look at the evaluation here, you can understand some of their virtues. Don't be a compatriot. To be honest, There are not many Chinese lawyers who have the ability to go to find an old American lawyer. The price is both reasonable and reliable. The provincial money can find a good translation to help you communicate.

这家律师楼就是一个骗子公司，尤其是以刚从国内新来的移民为对象，在交钱之前，花言巧语，各种保证，自吹自擂，等你交完钱了，立马就是另外一副嘴脸，你的案子能过都是运气，过不了就把所有责任推到你身上，没有一点职业道德，看看这里的评价就能了解一些他们的德行了，千万不要再上当了同胞们，说实话，华人律师里有能力的不多，还是去找个老美律师比较靠谱，价格既合理服务也靠谱，省的钱可以找个好点的翻译帮你交流。<//review>

(Translated by Google) Liar Lawyer Building, suspected of unreasonable charges, just started to talk well, waiting to pay a step in a trap, so what fees and fees are all out, in this lawyer's building can be considered to the lawyers association to complain about them!

(Original)
骗子律师楼，涉嫌乱收费，刚开始讲的好，等交钱了一步一个陷阱，这样费哪样费什么费都出来了，在这个律师楼吃亏的可以考虑到律师协会投诉他们！<//Review>

<text>Dropped a patient off there yesterday who definitely has a sinus infection, snoring and stops breathing while snoring.  Dr. listened and then prescribed allergy medication.  Not helpful and not listening.  Had to get pt signed up for a 17 dollar visit on line so he can get medication to get rid of the SINUS INFECTION.<//text>< Pics>

I have been going here for a number of years and have had different Doctors, some were wonderful, some not.  Initially I never waited more than 15 minutes before being called to the room.  Recently I had an appointment where I waited one and a half hours before being seen.  Dr. Chau was wonderful and took a lot of time with me as I had multiple complaints which ended with referrals and testing.  I am happy to wait, average waiting time at most Dr offices is one to two hours unless they don't really spend time with you.  I will be thrilled if Dr. Chau remains my Primary Dr.  I have seen changes over the years and it appears the Doctors have to see more patients which means longer waits.  I have never seen the clinic dirty, untidy yes because people don't pick up after themselves but leave for staff to pick up.  I have seen much worse places and feel quite confident that my care is good here.  Front desk does not have a lot of medical knowledge, however this is similar to most clinics I have been in.  Overall for a Non Profit, low income clinic I am pleased with it.  I could go elsewhere to Private Doctors but choose to stay there.  One particular reason is they have weekend and evening hours if urgent.  My one experience with Urgent Care was great, I arrived early in am and was seen right away, no problem.  If I think I may need to be seen I call and check if they are full or still taking patients and then prepare to wait if I am told I can come in.  Something to remember when you are waiting is, there is more than one Doctor in the back, so if you see different people going in, they are not being put ahead of you, they are seeing someone else.  I am ok waiting if when my time comes the Doctor takes time to take care of me and isn't rushing off out the door.  I would recommend most Doctors and Staff here and am glad it is available to me.<//text>

While the staff on duty in the waiting area weren't as friendly as I would of liked they were more then helpful & patient with my questions for filling out the forms.

As a walk in I did not expect a hasty visit & prepared as such. My visit in total was around 2 hours, but as a sudden walk in I can't complain. Both the nurse & the doctor who tended to me were very friendly, & helpful. Went in expecting terrible service ended up leaving with a very pleasant experience.

Oh & they also fixed me right up as well. Guess that's also an important piece of information to mention.< /text>

Horrible. They never answer the phones. Says they open at 8 called at 9 and the machine says "offices are now closed". This office is BS. The doctor is decent. The staff is TOLERABLE  but unprofessional and uneducated. The nurses seem like theyre still in training. Plus they get super rude when they don't know something instead of just asking someone. My 1 star is for the doctor and the cleanliness.<//text>

HORRIBLE! PLACE!  Went in two days in a row and both times were denied service.  First time it was 6:30 pm and they said they were not accepting any more walk-ins.  The second time it was 5:45 pm and was asked if this was for a child or an adult and was told that they were not accepting any more walk-ins for adults.  You should think about changing your hours or adding more doctors to that facility to handle the patients that walk through and need URGENT CARE services!!!<//review>

I’ve experienced horrible customer service from the front desk staff at CHC Blosser. CHC needs to hire qualified experienced staff for the front desk. The front desk staff are the face of any medical office and when they continuously treat clients with disrespect people are force to change doctors. As for the medical assistants and doctors are very nice and professional. Also, to be fair only CHC Blosser urgent care side has horrible, inexperienced, unprofessional front desk staff as I’ve never had issues with CHC in Santa Maria way.<//review>

< Review>
If you have ever been to a CHC you must know by now how "TERRIBLE" it is to BE SEEN by a Doctor. The times that I have came to a CHC location to see a Doctor have been just "TERRIBLE" I mean if you schedule an appointment at a certain time let's say at 8:00am which they encourage coming in 15mins sooner..guess what? They will have you waiting for nearly an HOUR!! What is the whole point of an appointment then?? Time is really valuable to us as a patient but wait there's more then once you do get seen you get RUDE staff and also a Doctor that doesn't LISTEN to your concerns and how your feeling. I find it really unprofessional when a Doctor talks to you in a condescending way. It doesn't make sense to correct me as a patient on how I'm feeling if i know how I feel.<//Review>

<Review>was misdiagnosed terribly, made a situation i had worse.  Trying a new doctor out, so far so good, seems very thorough.  One problem is not enough drs on staff, overwhelming in the Urgent Care are, people waiting everywhere.  They need a better system for sure.  Wouldn't recommend them for Urgent Care.  Also Xray tech is not always available.  There should be an xray tech there everyday and there is only 1. So my suggestion is get your act together on staffing and better communication between them and you.</Review>< Rate>

<Review>After dealing with the va for 7 years I never thought anyone could be worse then the va... I was wrong. We took our six month old son in to get his extreme congestion checked out, not only did they lie to my wife about when the Dr would be there they continued to lie to us about when he would be seen. After being told we only had five kids in front of us we watched as they push several families in front of us while continuing to tell us he was next. They had the nerve to call us after two and a half hours of watching this happen while we were strapping him into his car seat in the parking lot. I've never seen such disregard for someone's health in my life, he would of been better taken care of in a third world country.</Review>< Pics>

Really a disappointment and a black mark on the medical professional with 2 exceptions:. Marcelino (who helps with medication refills among other functions) and the chiropractor, Dr Pon.  He gets 5 stars without exception.   Everyone else 0-1 out of 10.</text>

Dr. Lilia Tovar has got to be one of the WORST Dr's chc employs. She has been caught falsifying documents, amongst other unethical practices. She shames the medical community.< /review>

Unfortunately, I found this Community Health Center on Blosser as a poor provider. Poor in work ethic. Poor in patient care. Poor in understanding what truly is healthcare. The CHC should be healthcare advocates in this underserved Santa Maria Valley. Hopefully, in the near future the CHC would conduct further training to this particular staff. The CHC staff showed a lack of knowledge and need of improvement. The CHC staff should be more knowledgeable about the different types of health insurances. Also, the CHC staff should become more competent on handling authorizations for their patient's. My experience with this place was unpleasant. Although the experience was unpleasant, I remained respectful to the staff I encountered. The CHC staff's morale and work ethic is definitely in need of improvment. The communication between the front and back office also needs improvement. I sincerely wish I could write a positive review about this CHC.</Text>

<Text>I am new to the area.  I needed medical attention.  I saw Dr. Fairburn.  He seemed like an excellent Dr.  No problems.  However, no job so I applied for Med-i-Cal while I waited the primary physician appt.  I had paid a huge chunk of cash for prior services.  CHC continually called me to say my Med-i-Cal would not pay.  I had to go to Med-i-Cal and have an agent guarantee payment.  CHC was trying to force me to continue paying cash.  The primary Dr. Refused to fill my T3 RX for my stroke.  She told ME to have Dr. FAIRBURN fill it.  She, Dr. Tabrizi would not return my call.
Dr. Fairburn 3 days later still had not filled my meds.  This is discrimination!  This is the worst medical practice I have ever seen.  Treatment is based on cash.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I've waited hours to be seen in the waiting room and another 45 mins in the actual room waiting for a doctor. Was told I was next and watched plenty of people go in before me. Had to listen to a kid that wouldn't stop screaming and with a very painful migraine. All the staff automatically assume you speak Spanish and get offended if you don't. Place is horrible...<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80ec6b7d69c77a99:0xf06c7aba2bce5c1b< /GmapID></record>

Arriving before the doors even open and still waiting nearly 2 hours to be seen is the most ridiculous experience. Talking to staff and hearing that they have one practitioner working in the mornings til 10am and on the weekends is atrocious.< /text>

< Review>
The 2 stars are because the flowers delivered were satisfactory:; however, the customer service was horrific. We placed an order online and prepaid, but our flowers did not arrive as scheduled. We called to ascertain their status, but no one answered the phone so we drove to the shop to inquire and folliw up. We were treated rudely by the staff who refused to provide us with any infirmation other than to state they could not locate our order. When we raised the issue of online fraud and a refund, our order magically appeared and the flowers were eventually delivered albeit very late. There are many competent florists in MB. Growing Wild is not amongst them.</Review>

Flower for our Anniversary.  My wife says this is the best bouquet of flowers she has received since the first dozen roses I sent her 30 years ago.

This place is the best! I called and was greeted by a very friendly voice! I told her what I was wanting to send, tulips in a rectangle glass vase. These folks nailed it, delivered on time, for a fair price. Could not be happier!!< /text>

<review>The bouquet that was sent to our daughter for her 30th birthday was fresh, beautiful and the colors so vivid.   This little shop is a real find when you are in town.  Absolutely so gorgeous You want to buy everything they have.  The delivery was on time and the delivery person very kind and friendly.  We are so pleased with their customer service also.   The shop called me to confirm the order and let me know that it would go out on time.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.< /review><name>Beth Lascheid< /name>< UserId.>

EXACTLY what I wanted. The bouquet nearly stole the show from me! I want to thank Ann, Megan, and the entire Growing Wild team for making my special day a beautiful (and sweet smelling!) one. I will certainly be using them again.<//review>

<GmapID>0x80c2b3ec78548b67:0xb63e5351abcac295</GmapID><text>My order was delivered at 10:30am and left outside of the recipients house. I was not called until 4:30pm and told this information. When I asked the delivery person why he didn’t call me sooner so that I could call the person I sent the bouquet to and let them know their flowers were just left sitting in the HOT sun all day..his response..”I don’t know.”
I then called the store and received a call back two days later with an apology.
I’ve used this store for years. This is  unacceptable.  At a minimum they should have re-sent the delivery or refunded me the order. Clearly the flowers were ruined sitting outside all day.
Very disappointing<//text></record></dataset><record>

I ordered from Growing Wild and the flowers were delivered quickly and were even prettier than the image online. Thank you so much. You never know what will be delivered when ordering flowers that you will never see, so I was happy that these were what was depicted on the website. I'll order from Growing Wild again.< /text>

What an amazing gift. Flowers were beautiful & delivery was personal & at requested time. So many beautiful arrangements on website, made it hard to choose. I will definitely be ordering my gifts from them again.<//Review>

<text>Because the arrangements look so beautiful and unique online and they receive so many glowing reviews, I was excited to order from Growing Wild. However, I was very disappointed with my experience as the item delivered was not up to par with the quality I expected from the price I paid and images shown online. I tried to contact GW many times by email to discuss the difference between the expected arrangement (I had even ordered a premium upgrade) and what was delivered, but I still haven't received a reply.</text><date>1583362837653</date>< userid>

Fantastic experience, the quality and care in the arrangement was obvious and much much much better than those big chain online flower options. Growing Wild is my new go to florist.<//review>

Guess what...they emailed and called me to make sure I was okay with changes to the order.  I was truly impressed.  And guess what? My sister was blown away by an absolutely stunning arrangement that they made just for her.   Five stars all the way.  I wish I still had a picture of the arrangement.  It was gorgeous.< /Review>< rate>

They make beautiful arrangements and are always on the cutting edge of design.  Whether you are looking for a gift, a centerpiece for a party, or a beautiful piece for your home, you will be able to find it here.  My personal favorites are their door wreaths and their succulents.  I also like to purchase hostess gifts here during the holidays because they always have great ornaments and unique things in all price ranges.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Growing Wild takes flowers and home decorating to another level - they are true artists. Their arrangements are unique, thoughtful and breathtaking. I am always amazed at what they come up with and receive lots of compliments.  I haven't used their home decorating service yet, but after seeing the work they did at a friend's house for the holidays, I was blown away and will definitely take advantage of this service in the future!</Text>< pics>

<text>Growing Wild has amazing items:  Fun floral arrangements with candles and succulents included, artwork, and holiday gifts.  I have two floral arrangements in my home and 2 pieces of art that are in my entry way from Growing Wild.  I recommend this shop if you are looking for original, creative, "hip", and gorgeous arrangements.  They have the latest and newest trends of art and flowers so stop by if you are in the area!<//text>< Pics>

Growing Wild is hands-down the best quality florist I have ever come across - a total class act.  Their arrangements and wreaths are the most original and beautiful. And they have gorgeous and creative home decor for the holidays and throughout the year - indeed, I just received some of their Thanksgiving decor that promptly went on my mantle. I have other pieces from Growing Wild that I bring out for Easter and Christmas that I love - they are elegant pieces that stand the test of time (their ornaments are like no others!).  Still hanging is a shell wreath I was given as a house warming present 13 years ago that makes the room.  The owners are incredibly generous to the community as well.  I co-founded a nonprofit and Growing Wild has, without exception, answered the call for every single event we have ever thrown.  They are true community partners, and for that we in this tiny beach town are grateful.</text>

We’re always taken away with Growing Wild’s arrangements and customer service. We ordered my Aunt this beautiful orchid/succulent combo for her birthday. While I was traveling in New York, Growing Wild dropped her arrangement off on her front porch and someone sadly stole it. I emailed GW immediately That night after realizing she hadn’t received the arrangement. They called me at 8am the next morning and put together a new one for her. So sad that someone would do this, but Growing Wild’s service was heart warming and unbelievable. We will absolutely continue to be customers of Growing Wild. My family and I highly recommend all of their arrangements. We love this locally owned business!< /review>

Extraordinary flowers, service, and attention to detail.  I've ordered from Growing Wild on several occasions and every time, the recipient was extremely happy and satisfied and commented on the incredible arrangements.  Most have also sent pictures of the arrangements I'd sent and I've always had my expectations surpassed with the arrangement that was sent.  THANK YOU!</Text>

<text>From the very start I should have been wary, called approximately 10 times before I was able to reach anyone at the store. The staff who answered the phone was apologetic and took my order for an orchid to be delivered the following day for a birthday. The flowers were never delivered.

For flower store who advertises as a Bloomnation partner, this is pretty disappointing although not as disappointed as my girlfriend who did not receive flowers on her birthday. I will look elsewhere for flowers next time.< /text><date>1471635450827< /date>< Pictures>

< review>
Can someone plz help me! My package has been at this place for a week. I called and they told me USPS has my package. So I waited on hold for an hour to talk to someone at USPS & they do NOT have it. These reviews have me worried that it got stolen or lost.< /review>

< review>
Terrible Carrier Company. My package coming from CA  to New York sat at their facility in Compton, CA for days. It was then In transport and sat in New Jersey from  Sept 24th to today the 28th, and now update says its in Indiana. USPS was waiting on package in all places and still waiting  Seriously! New Jersey in next to NY! If i see a merchant is using this company, I will never buy from them. This company has the worst reviews but merchants  are still using them. This company is the worst. Don’t Use them. Find out from your sender if they are using them, and if they are, buy from another vender. Warning using these guys you may be in for a bad or disappointing experience. Venders... your shipping is a reflection on you and your company or product. This company may make it hard for repeat customers. I know i won’t be buying again.</review>

The Compton location is the worst place to have a shipment. The packages sit at this location for days or weeks way after the delivery date or it mysteriously comes up missing or stolen once it arrives to this Compton ghetto location. You will
Never receive any feedback from the supervisor even if the merchant gets involved. Most horrible business practice & place ever.< /Review>

<review>As with all DHL delivery your package will sit there for days if it isn't stolen or severly damaged. They so not list a phone number because of all the complaints.

This was hands down, without a doubt, the most absolute worst job I have ever had in my entire life. I know it sounds hyperbolic but it truly felt only a few ticks above picking cotton. All of the same motions are there, you are bent over in a hot and oppressive environment, literally yelled at to fill up a burlap sack to capacity quickly and threatened and humiliated every single night if you do not meet your quota. I am simply AMAZED that a “60 Minutes” like exposé has not been made on the EXTREME humiliating and mortifying treatment those employees have to go through. I implore anyone who can read this to NEVER accept a job at ANY DHL DISTRIBUTION CENTER and just make sure you do what needs to be done to never be In a position where you will have to take on this type of slave labor. I truly feel sorry for all of those people still stuck there.<//review>

You guys are the worst in transporting packages. Avoid this company like the plague. They will keep your package for about 7 days until they send it out. Packages seem to always get lost and peoples address are being shown on the DHL Review Photos. Its against the law to have that information for the public to see.< /text>

<review>Where can i start......
I asked for a package to come and be picked up on friday....didnt even bother to show up.

so i though fine they should at least come Monday or at latest Tuesday nope nothing....

i arrange a new pick up and the driver that comes later than my window time that i assigned.
not only that the driver was really rude....rushing us saying he had to leave....word of advice do not come in at the very end of our window time them if you have to leave.....
to a cherry on the cupcake i work like 5 minutes away...walking distance....
soooooo would i recommend using this service?

heck no if you are a customer service based company then the drivers should be trained and should have enough time to stay at least 20 min and not 1 minute.........

FEDEX AND UPS ARE WAY BETTER AND WORTH USING EVEN IF IT COST EXTRA.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

My monthly subscription package gets stuck here every month for about a week before they send it to my post office for them deliver it to me. Never use DHL to ship anything in a timely matter.< /review>

So I bought a package from wish and the carrier was DHL and for some apparent reason they managed to mess up my package and slap me with a insufficient address when clearly I wrote the right address as clearly as the name on my birth certificate I guess this is the reason I give them a 2-star I mean, I know I'll get my package eventually but ...just sucks..</text>

We only come here for the tacos, although the butcher counter looks amazing, and their grocery selection is diverse. We get the buche and the lengua tacos. Their red salsa packs a kick, but worth it I'm flavor. Everything has always been top quality!!</text>

<time>1540687136960<//time><Text>I am writing this review on the burrito that I had as THIS is the food I love. Small little places that you find in the back of a grocery store in the middle of a town that sells what they know. I have been to Watsonville once before and have wanted “gas station” burritos ever since.
The burritos were awesome as they were prepared right in front of you and you got several choices of toppings. We got the beef and the carnitas...I did want to try the tongue but they were out! 😄
The rest of the market was small but looked to have a good selection. But again, we were there for the ready made food and we were not disappointed.

There is a GEM of a tacqueria hidden in the back corner of this grocery store.  They have the absolute BEST Burritos & Tortas I have ever had.  Sunset Magazine rated them one of the top 10 must have burritos in California< /Review>

I've been coming here for many years.  Groceries in the front, tasty tacos, tortas, burritos in the back.  Today I had the fajita chicken in torta form.  And in the produce department, I got big limes, 8 for $1!  And Rosa's Las Grande tortillas, which are hard to find in the city.  Perfect the go with a Mexican soup.</Text>

Found some of what i needed although i was very disappointed . i was planning to buy sum powder baby milk and it was expired since2014 and what upset me the most that they crossed out the expirtation date with a black permanent marker to avoid the date showing on most of the powder milks ...also when i went up to one of the workers or (manager) all he did was take the milk i had in my hands away and placed it on top of a counter ...baby's are gna get sick if they keep this up.</text>

Would definitely recommend to anyone.<//review>< pics>

Phoned them twice with queries regarding one of their products. Good explanation and very patient when I phoned a second time to resolve a minor detail. Thank you Robert! It would be most helpful if their catalogue were updated as it is 10 years adrift which resulted in a degree of confusion. However, ABS are there to help.</text>

Staff was nice & professional about my Master cylinder rebuild. Fair price, fast turn around time. Brakes working great now! 👍
Keep in mind: You bring the part, not the car to this location.</Review>

<review>Absolutely not. I will never bring them anything ever again. They tried 3 times to rebuild my master cylinder and had the nerve to charge me to repair their mistake. No, no, no. If you like stopping, don't shop here. The customer service is just terrible.< /review><response>None</response>< pictures>

Definitely recommend coming here! These guys are very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. Called in advance to get some information about what they carried, and what we needed. When we arrived it was already pre packed and ready for us. Eddie was super friendly and helpful with all the questions we had. Will definitely be coming back, and will recommend these guys to everyone we know.<//text>

We are a commercial truck repair shop. We use ABS for all of our gear box and steering pump rebuilding. They are great to work with. Quick turn around time. And great fair prices, we love that! Then, we pass on deals to our customers and they are happy too!
Thanks ABS!!!</Text>

They need a better policy on answering questions on problems that you have with there electric power brake systems. I have sent two emails to them with no results. I have talk to them on the phone twice & can't get an answer. I wish I knew this when I purchased this product. I just have simple question about the wiring , It must be some highly guarded secret or there teck dept. is lost .The problem is the pressure switch!</Review>

This company lies & I am tired of dealing with them. They acted like they did not have my email so I gave it to them again. They still did not send me any information I have had enough of there lies & B.S. These people should be out of business. If this Memo worked for me I would terminate his employment fast, before he destroys my business.<//text>

<user>117397337702427061666<//user><response>None<//response><Review>We put an ABS electric brake system with the remote accumulator in a street rod.  the pump and accumulator  failed after only about  1200 miles which IMO was related to design issues.   ABS offered a replacement (updated) pump and accumulator at a significantly reduced price to replace the original units.  So far the updated system has performed flawlessly.  Regarding servicing this system there is an "O" ring that is placed between the accumulator and the pump body.  Care must be taken not to damage that "O" ring and insure it is evenly compressed when tightening the accumulator.   When operating correctly this system is a good solution for a frame mounted M/C.   Both Pedro and Memo were very helpful in correcting the problem and offering a reasonable settlement for the failure.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I have talked to these clowns two times, Memo said he would email me the info but never has. I am going back with my old system & anybody that gives them any business in the future is waiting there money & time. I really feel let down & hope this not the way they do business. For a usa company it sure is ashamed that people do stuff like this.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced from this company.  The product, although used in many vehicles has failed 3 times completely, with the last failure being a pressure switch.  I figured it would be simple enough to get a new one, so, I took a picture, e-mailed it to them, and followed up with a call.  This was on 7/14/17.  During our call, I spoke with Memo, and he transferred me to someone to place the order.  I gave them my CC number and expected it to arrive 5 - 7 days later.  8/6 I hadn't received my part yet, so, I called and I finally received it today 8/14, and, of course, it's the wrong switch as well as they over charged me (they told me $45, I was charged $80) and I requested they ship it FedEx on their dime, it arrived UPS on my dime.  Done with this system, good riddance ABS!<//Review>

Mr Ed and Mr Lemo are very friendly and accomodating to fix any problems I ran into. Their product is high quality and as advertised, bolt-on   I will be doing business with them in the future for my rear brakes for my 1950 Chrysler Imperial.<//Text>

<Time>1443514478334</Time><rate>2<//rate><Text>Basically they make there own brackets and then just take other rotors and calipers from other cars and sell it as a kit. While this is smart for them, should you need break pads or seals or whatever you can't go to the auto parts store and get them, because you don't know what year make and model car they are from. The break booster hit a support on my car and they told me "just remove the support". I had to end up removing the proportioning valve, mount it elsewhere and make new break lines to connect the two. Either that or "remove a SUPPORT off my classic car. So the direct bolt on kit isn't quite so direct bolt on. The calipers need painting or they will rust like mine did (didn't say to do that anywhere) The instructions are horrible, the picture isn't clear enough to show how the stuff bolts together, the how to steps are not even close to complete. So if you are a figure it out kind of person you are good cause you're going to have to just figure it out,  if not you're SOL.There are no torque specs....remember this is a drum to disk conversion I can't just look in my OEM book for torque specks. My break lines leak at the caliper, afraid to tighten them any more and break the bolt because there are no torque specs...the old guy that answers the phone is rude and it took way longer to get in than I was quoted (didn't tell me they were back ordered) I wouldn't use there services again. I forget why I chose them over Wilwod to start with. The truck I'm building now and every future build will not have a ABS part on them.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

They Changed the design of the product does not match photos or directions staff unwilling to rectify problems. DOES NOT COME WITH REMOTE ACCUMULATER as pictured.
Makes unit larger than with remote accumulater greatly limiting the mounting options.
Will be missing the charity car show at Texas Childrens Hospital due to their incompetence. Truck on Cover for the event ! Really Happy about that! Not only do they lie they turned me into a liar DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY..<//Review>

I have two, ABS Electric Brake systems 57 Tbird, and a 56 Fairlane both of them are having the same issue (pressure switch). Working with these people is horrible, it takes them forever to ship. When Memo tells you they had a bad batch of pressure switches, and charges you for the replacement is bad business . If I had it to do over again I would not use them.< /review>

It's 100 miles from the border, rarely even manned (except for Sunday afternoons) and easy to just go around by using the Minneola Rd or Harvard Rd exit. But it's an icon on the trip between Vegas and LA just like the giant Baker Thermometer and Zzyzx Rd, and for that reason it'll be just slightly missed when it's replaced by the station under construction closer to the border.< /text>

We just passed thru, no response from the agent,we came to a stop again no response at all not stop not go nothing. Pulled over to observe all cars treated the Same. Called the station spoke with Jim said he was a supervisor even he had an attitude after telling him we just pulled away and I told him it was the man in the first booth, he wanted me to tell him what he looked like, "a man in a uniform in the 1st booth" duh I just drove away I told him 10 seconds ago what do we have working for us time to shut this boondoggle down what a waste of our tax money< /Review>

After initially being opposed to this station constitutional grounds I think I have been converted! While traveling through Yermo,CA my car was stopped. They asked all usual government questions but when I protested I was taken out of the car. After watching serval re education videos I understand that this is just how we keep our food safe in conjuction with chemical trails in the sky. I love USA!!!< /Review>

As other posts mention, these stations exist to protect the state's agricultural industry. This is an underfunded effort and relies on mostly voluntary cooperation from the public.

Bad reviews won't stop invasive species.</review>

This is such a useful station... they should build two more for the two roads just to the south of the 15...and while they are at it perhaps build one for the railroad as well.< /text>

< Review>
The day was finally here! 8:00 am, August 8th, 2016. I woke up in Las Vegas with the taste of Corona and regret in my mouth. After a delicious and wholly filling breakfast at the ever classy "The Orleans" resort and casino, my cohorts and I made way for our final destination in California. But we would first find ourselves slowing down well into the state. I was confused momentarily until I remembered...Yermo.

You see, ever since I was a young boy I'd dreamed of visiting the Yermo Border Station on I-15. Not just visiting, no, I wanted to smuggle agriculture. I've a desperate itch to beat the system. Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, I did just that. Smuggled in 20 lbs of grapes and my personal "invasive species" collection of bugs. GG California, you're done for.<//Review>

Last poster does not know what parasites do to vegetation.  On the other hand, I'm a bit thin, + need my trail mix or I'll die. Would they take away my Sun Maid Raisins? Agri monoitors certain fruit trees around here.  foes anyone know how bad even kitchen weevils are? they "bore" through cardboard,  stryrofoam,  and eat your foof.  Like worms but worse.</text>

Just another location where government can control the masses. Just like the one in Temecula and the one in San Clemente well within our borders but a means to segregate society if we have upheaval. We are all sheeples</text>

Literally pointless. Slowed down traffic to get to a guy who was watching Netflix on his phone and waving g everybody through. 5/5 would agriculturally inspect again.</Review>

What bad place of business, i had all my window tinted with this place of business and it was a bad experience. Not only do they no go by there 1 year warranty policy the owner or Diego will pretty much call you a lier, i came the day before to make sure they can take care of the issue and get everything resolved. He wanted to blame me because there was factory tint on the glass and I asked him if it's a problem I don't mine going somewhere else before the job start and he reassure me that it would not be a problem. Not only did Diego tell me to come back but that he would do it himself. So today I went in he went back on his word not that I'm surprised most Hispanic business do that not to be offensive, but he didn't even bother to do the work. He thought it would be better that he would go get a haircut and say things under his breath.  Diego you have horrible customers service skills, you should stick to what you say. Customer don't let the short chubby guy work on your car he's more interested in flirting with the chick he was with and texting and worried about his play list. If anyone does want great window tinting go to ultraviolet window tinting they have the best warranty on the work they do. And it's about the same price.

Sure there's not you owner there told me it would be a problem now you get defensive because you were caught lying. Your a joke. You said it having previous tint would no be a problem like I stated the first time. Like I said I waisted time going there and I'm sure every one calling the guy driving the blue Tacoma Diego i must have just his heard everyone i guess. Be a man and admit you were wrong and lied. Any who people go to Ultraviolet Window tinting they guarantee there work for as long as you own your car not this joke. Another learn to count buddy. We'll see each other soon.

The workers scratched my car and did not want to fix it. This place is terrible. And if you are going either way I advise you to take pictures of your car before.< /review>< user_id>

< review>
I have always brought my vehicles here to get great quality tint installed. “Miguel” always gives me a great price and the quality of work and customer service is outstanding! I always refer family/friends here because i know their cars will be done correctly and they will be very pleased with the outcome. I have never had issues with the tint peeling or bubbling. Great Warranty! Great Service!</review>

It's a beautiful place I can be very windy and cold and not inviting. However if you like seeing sea life or just walking your dog this is a place for you.< /review>

Fantastic opportunities for photographing sea otters, birds, and other wild life around the Moss Landing Harbor.

Parking is available behind the Farm Fresh Produce Market (7990 CA-1, Moss Landing, CA.) and the Whole Enchilada (7902 CA-1, Moss Landing, CA.) look for the sign "Moro Cojo Slough" (wetland) and enjoy the walking trail.< /Text>

<Review>3 stars because the food is always great, but they were extremely slow today. It wasn't that busy compared to other trips I've had to In-N-Out, it took us 45 minutes from arriving to getting our food. It was not a welcome addition to our drive home today. Had I known it would have taken so long, we definitely would not have gone here today.</Review>< Pictures>

A bit busy at lunch time on a Saturday, but not unusual for In-N-Out. Friendly. A bit slow right now, but worth the wait. If going thru the drive thru, look for the signs stating 'drive thru' with the arrows. You can watch the traffic on the freeway as you wait.<//text>

<text>Great service. Drive thru crazy busy. I went inside. A few on line but moved very quickly. Food was great. Came out quickly. Only every other table open for seating because of pandemic. I was glad I'd stopped there. Well worth it.< /text><time>1618013913740</time>< user>

So good to eat in-store again. I think it adds 20% to the taste score. So that's 120% in total</review>

<Review>1st time I have to say it was not the best. Barely any lettuce and just didn't taste like an in n out burger.  Never ever had an experience  like this taste at any other in n out. It's okay tho sometimes it happens. I will always continue  to visit in n out, just not the temecula one for a while 11pm ish visit< /Review></record>

<Review>You can either do the drive-thru to give your order or walk in and order. You cannot eat in the restaurant. There are tables outside where you can sit and eat. I made my order for takeout, but decided I didn't want to eat in my car, so I sat at one of the outside tables to eat. There is no inside seating allowed.

This In 'N' Out Burger gave me exactly what I asked for, a hot and juicy hamburger. when they ask if I want onions, I tell them to put on both fresh and grilled onions. In addition, I asked for a package of their spread that I add to the Burger as I'm eating it. This time I didn't get any cheese.

I also ordered a large Arnold Palmer to drink, which is a combination of iced tea and lemonade, named after the golfer who popularized it.

I was drinking the combination well before it became popular, and we had a name for the mixture that I won't print here. The combination of the lemonade and the iced tea looks like dirty Brown river water, but it tastes good.

Of course, you can't see what it looks like in the In 'N' Out drink cup.< /Review><Name>Dan Branstrom</Name><GmapID>0x80db7e30578e31b7:0xc6f8c6818f9b251d< /GmapID>< user>

For me there is nothing like In-N-Out Burgers together with animal fries, what I enjoy about this particular restaurant was the large outdoor seating area and plenty of parking spaces</text>

We came in here after a great deal of running around on a Saturday afternoon... As always, they were busy... Although everyone was kind, courteous and helpful... They completely messed up our order... We only ordered two cheeseburgers and two drinks with fries... Not exactly a large nor difficult order... However, they still got our order wrong...< /Review>

It's In-n-Out, what more do I need to say, but there is a lot to say anyway.  The 3x3 ("three by three") is my go to meal, and I'll tell ya what, it's delicious every time. It's a delight to have great burgers at a great. Even those folks with five dudes can't hold a candle.  And this place has the prices that would seem too cheap for the food.<//Review>

This IN-N-OUT location takes so long inside. There was only 3 other people in front of me in line and it took me over 15 minutes to get my order. The drive thru seemed pretty quick but the inside was not. Do not get out!<//review>

I appreciate In-N-Out for their consistent service and quality. Portions are always good,  orders are always filled out correctly,  everything is packed neatly if it's a to-go order.

Lines are long during the peak hours but it moves relatively quickly.<//Review>

I grew up in the town next to Baldwin Park, where the original In-N-Out was located. I have always loved the single cheese burger with grilled onions and the crispy fry bites at the bottom of the basket of fries, with pink lemonade, Please. Yum. We have not lived in a state with an In-N-Out for more than 25 years, so we make to the best burger when we travel.< /text>

This store does great if you order their usual...any special order throws them into  Chaos...they just can't get it right
I sat at the window 5 mins watching them pile up 4 orders waiting on mine then they had me pull out front and it was another 5 mins for them to bring it out! Amazing all i ordered was a cheeseburger with catsup and mustard pickle...real difficult ..I guess for them ot was 10 mins in line
5 mins at window 5 mins in front of the store...
It has happened Everytime I go there..just happens to b where I was working both times...this location is off my list..</Review>

The food is always flawless, but the coke is suffering. The mixture of syrup must be off cause it's not the good coke In-N-Out used to have.<//Review>

<Text>In-n-Out has the absolute best fast food burgers anywhere. Having moved out of an area where there is an In-n-Out it had been years since I had one of their burgers. Unfortunately my health has made me very sensitive to beef and I usually cannot eat it. Knowing how In-n-Out only serves the best quality beef I had a burger and it was amazing. While there was some issue work my health it was not bad at all.

Outstanding as usual.  COVID-19 BS protocol of course in effect,  but still excellent friendly customer service, speedy service and good food. They do have socially distanced inside seating available and of course outside, plus drive through.</review>

Came here for lunch and as usual, every in and out I’ve been to has been super busy. Guess all the hype isn’t just the hype but their food must be as good. And it was! I ordered the double double with animal style fries and it was delicious. The customer service was great and the food came out in a timely manner. The restaurant was super busy but even with all the chaos, it was clean and everyone was friendly. I would have in and out again in the future.<//Review>

Service was fast, the location is great as you can see it from freeway.  There wasn't so many people in a Saturday night which was great as we were driving to San Diego.  Prices of course accessible for the good yummy food.</text>

<review>First time ever at an In-N-Out and the place serves hamburgers, fries and drinks to include shakes. What is remarkable is everything is quite fresh and nothing was greasy or heavy. I loved the fresh burger that seemed to be prepared just when I ordered it and did not seem frozen. The leaf lettuce was crisp and fresh as were the tomatoes and onions. The fries too were well made and fluffy inside. Really good burger place.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I've always been a fan of In-N-Out because their shakes have such a signature taste that I cant get enough of! Try their animal style fries only if you're starving though because as soon as it cools the cheese solidifies and turns into a block of cheese, fries, and In-N-Out sauce. Otherwise a good place for friends to hang out eat< /Review>

Fresh and super delicious burgers, fries and shakes.
One of the top 3 burger places, for sure.

<text>There's a reason In-N-Out is a staple of the Californian food culture, and this location lives up to it. While a little smaller than other locations in the area, it has a nice outdoor area which is a valid option even in February thanks to our wonderful weather out here.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODwHs6F0YGnXipyqq4Dk_oTI6AEPTMc7ot1B8t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80db7e30578e31b7:0xc6f8c6818f9b251d</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

A simple and consistently good California classic. In-N-out may not be flashy food but it never disappoints.  They are also offering free hot chocolates to kids under 12 (who are present) on rainy days,  a super cute promotion! Try animal style fries,  they are my fav <3</text>

I use to come to this in n out location often but I haven't been for awhile. Still wonderful as it use to be. The drive through line was super long but I went inside and it was super quick. I ordered my food and got it within 15 minutes.  In N out will always by my favorite! Thanks for the wonderful service! Will be back soon< /Text>

The burguers are great, best fast food in California.

They have this secret menu which is awesome!

Remember to tell them to go easy with the onions.

The double double are the best.<//review>

In and out.  Food always tastes great (though I feel like their meat got thinner and smaller) and customer service is always great.  When we went around 3 PM, it was almost empty and it was nice.  Their bathroom can get some up grades.  They dont have baby changing tables in the bathroom.</review>

If you are on a low carb diet you can actually order a burger with out feeling like you are throwing out half of it.  They gladly serve you and seem to have no judgement always a pleasant experience< /text>

The burgers and fries are excellent at In-N-Out Burger.  Their fries are gluten free, where as other places fries are cooked in the same oil as breaded stuff.  This helps my daughter who has to stay away from gluten.  She orders the protein wrap and fries with no worries.  The burger is cooked on a different grill than the burger buns too.<//Text>

Many employees working fast, fix order mistakes quickly, go inside if  you want only a French fries order, they will serve it up quickly. Fresh, whole foods. Top notch, even the famous  are known to eat at In & Out !< /Text>

Good thing i could ask for extra packet of sauce.   Wish they would have given me 2 packets,  then everything would have been perfect.  Regardless,  still love in & out.<//text>< username>

Fries are fresh cut there on site; I've always been kind of amazed at the big cutter. Shakes are great and the animal fries are my favorite! Not the healthy choice, but that's a given...

My husband and I have not been to In-Out in a long time and I must say the burgers were as good as we remembered. We dine in and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. You could tell the staff and management take pride in their restaurant. Staff walking around asking how was the meal, staff constantly wipping down tables and sweeping food off the floor. We enjoyed our meal and the whole In-Out experience. Highly recommend.<//text>

I love the hamburger animal style.  The shakes are some of the best I've tasted at a fast food restaurant.  Only issue is that you can be stuck in the lines for 20 minutes or longer.</Review>

The staff members at this location are consistently friendly.

Their drive thru is fast and efficient, especially with a worker taking orders by the drive thru so the line does not get too hectic.

As per usual, the cheeseburger was just right with the savory meat, crunchy lettuce and fluffy buns! To pair it off with their clean cut fries, made the meal fresh!

We enjoy In N Out, for its quality burgers that always seem to be crafted well with care.<//Text>

An iconic west coast burger joint that actually serves quality food at a reasonable price.  One of the more distinctive tastes in burger chains.  You can order off menu, and quite a few reasonably popular orders are not on the menu.<//text>

You can't go wrong with any In-N-Out! Food is always bomb!! And, their customer service is better than most fancy sit down restaurants...Yes, you will wait a little longer for your food here but the taste and quality are well worth it!!</Review>

In-N-Out is always the best... I do however wish they used cheddar cheese instead of American, I think it would go better with there fresh ingredients, never frozen food porosity... American cheese dosen't melt well, and tastes processed... Chedder is very melty and taste like natural cheese</text>

Well,
I must be brutally honest....I haven't been to a In & Out for about a year. I won't name the one my daughter and I received food  poisoning with our order 😟. HOWEVER...
Went on a CBI with the kids & yeah baby my taste buds were revitalize 😁. Grilled cheese with lettuce, tomatoes and grilled onions, French fries and Neapolitan shake, Aaaaaaaaah, so yummy 👍< /text>

<Text>Great and fast service as always and the burgers were great. This place is doing something right because I can go to an In-N-Out down the street or 100 miles from my house and I know the people will be awesome and the food will be great. BTW, gotta have the "animal style" burger if you like grilled chopped onions. It is on their secret menu.<//Text>< Pics>

Burgers are decent. Fries lack flavor and are too oily.</text>

<Text>The food is always good of course, but the lines are always ridiculous!! I mean if you plan on eating here on your lunch break then think again because It usually takes a good 30 to 40 minutes in the drive thru and that's on a regular day. The menu is basic! Burgers and fries!! That's really all they need to sell and they bank off of that!! My only complaint is that I have to tell them to burn my meat or cook it well done because I've actually had my burger practically bleeding because the meat was so raw! That's just disgusting to me. I know some people like and order it that way, but I'm not one of them!
I can't handle any kind of uncooked meat!!
For a fast food joint In -N-Out Burger might take a long time to get your food but it will be well worth it! I promise! (If you like burgers that is) Lol. 😁👌<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Don't know what happened, but we had to wait while others received their orders even though they order after us, only 2 of us. The burgers didn't taste the same,  been a few years since had double double,  just didn't taste right. Should have stopped there, and returned the food,  within 30 minutes of eating, she got bad cramps, and actually got sick. Wont be going back to this location<//Review>

Who doesn't like a little In-N-Out??  If you don't know this already, get your burger "animal style" and your fries "well done".  Simple perfection!<//text>

In-N-Out has a simple menu - just burgers and fries.  It's all delicious.  The drive thru lone can get long at lunch time, but it move quickly.  Note that there are some options that can be ordered off-menu including grilled onions and cheese fries.<//Review>

This location is hands down better than the Murrieta, CA location. The food is comprable, but the human and vehicle traffic is so much better here. You can literally wait in line for a good 10 to 15 minutes before you get your order at the Murrieta restaurant. The staff was all friendly very polite and tended to your needs as requested.
This is a great location not just for burgers, but for other restaurants surrounding this spot; especially for those with picky eaters.<//Text>

<review>My 1st time here and Wow what a lousy hamburger! Greasy! And that ol saying "Where's The Beef" fit's perfectly! I'm never going to be going here again. I ordered just a single burger with cheese and fries. The fries were the worst I've ever had in My life! Dry and little if any salt!

Best burgers-in the cleanest environment, served by upstanding young smiling faces.
Paying any more for a burger elsewhere, won't make the food taste any better.</Review>

<Text>This is just like every In-N-Out you've ever been into.  It's may be a bit older than some but the food is just as good.  If you like a fresh burger made your way then you know what to get.  Don't forget the chopped chillies!< /Text>< pictures>

I rarely go to In-N-Out because it's a little far from my home. I sat in the drive through behind the vehicle at the window for more than 15min. When I got my food, it was cold.</text>

What can I say...as a non-native it’s a requirement to stop at In-N-Out while I’m in Temecula.   The staff here is very friendly and the restaurant is very clean.
The food is quality and you get way more than you pay for.   They don’t try to be great at everything, just serve an excellent burger.   While my Texas heart will always belong to Whataburger, this place is a close second and I’ll continue to visit this location when I visit.</Text>

< Review>
You know, it's In N Out! The food is fresh, the shakes are extra thick, and the fries must be eaten within 5 minutes of receiving your food or they turn into shards of glass. What's not to love? Animal style your burger and fries to fatten up, or dip your fries into a chocolate shake to freak out your friends. It's a Cali classic.<//Review>

<Text>Love In-N-Out! Love this store. It's usually clean & tidy,  even when busy.
I LOVE how the young employees are very courteous, friendly, and professional. They look you in the eye and can speak in complete sentences!And they all hustle. Not at ALL like the typical skulking, pissy teenager at most fast food places (or anywhere that young people lurk). I don't know what In-N-Out is doing to their employees 🤔 but... KEEP IT UP!
The quality of burger you get for the same price or LESS than other burger chains is UNMATCHED. *FRESH* crispy lettuce, no soggy tomato slices, decent bun, cheese MELTED on the just-right-burger (not a slapped-on piece of cold cheese that I get at some burger joints. (Yes... I'm looking at YOU, Burger King.) You get your burger  wrapped up all neat & tidy in a wrapper that cuts down my napkin use from 3,000 to 2. Oh... I'm also overly excited over the milkshakes... I can afford to get BOTH a burger AND a shake. (Livin' large!) Great experience every time!< /Text><gmapID>0x80db7e30578e31b7:0xc6f8c6818f9b251d< /gmapID>< date>

In my experience what makes or breaks an In-n-out Burger is the fries. They either have great fries or they don't. Sadly on my last visit I was a bit underwhelmed by the quality of the fries, I think I may have gotten the "bottom of the bucket" but they were a bit soggy and undercooked.< /review>

For those people who need to reduce their carbo intake, order "protein style". You get the same great burger, but instead of a bun, it's wrapped in lettuce.</review>

It's your typical In and Out with good food at great prices and a long drive thru line that moves fairly quickly.< /Review>

Classic in-n-out. We added an extra burger when we got to the window to pay, and when we drove up to the next window to get our burgers they ended up forgetting the extra burger we added. I should've checked the order before driving off, and I forgot to get it in the boxes rather than the bags so it was harder to see. We couldn't go back so my sister ended up without a burger. :(<//Review>

One of only two In-&-out burgers in the immediate area. The other is off Los Alamos Road in nearby Murrieta. Good parking and outdoor seating area. Right off Jefferson avenue in Temecula.</Text>

Same a the other nearby In-N-Out in Murrieta (see my other review), I Iove their cheeseburgers just as much. The only advantage I can think of is that this is that this is closer to the mall. Lines can be long at peak hours but the staff is very nice and that makes up for the wait IMO.< /text>

Customers come in constantly in drive-through and in-store.
It is very wonderful to choose cooking methods and toppings.
It was a short distance from the motel, but because at night is a dark sidewalk, it was more convenient to go by car.
Taste and amount also it might be Japanese taste!

とってもおいしかったです。

Without demeriting chains, it's good to support local businesses especially if they're doing it right. By the way you will only find 3 types of burgers and there are no more options, I think that helps them to be good at the one they present.

No cabe duda que son las mejores hamburguesas en California, y no sólo por su sabor pues además son un negocio local que solo encontrarás en California y si acaso muy escasos locales en estado vecinos pero siguen conservando el sabor de no hecho por cadena o franquicia. Sin deméritar a las cadenas, es bueno apoyar a los negocios locales especialmente si están haciendo las cosas bien. Por cierto solo encontrarás 3 tipos de hamburguesas y no hay más opciones, creo que eso les ayuda a ser buenos en la que presentan.</Review><user>105359925666883270597</user>< Pictures>
