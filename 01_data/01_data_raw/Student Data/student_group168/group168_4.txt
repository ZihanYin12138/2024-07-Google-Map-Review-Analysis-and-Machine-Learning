<Text>We stumbled upon this restaurant while we were traveling and we feel so lucky we found this gem. The food is delicious and made with so much love. We are from India and the Indian food here tasted so authentic. The owner and servers are very friendly, the owner made us feel special with her suggestions, kind words and stories of her experiences. We could feel the positive vibes at this place and had a really good time :) Highly recommend it!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>What a discovery! The food was delicious and we enjoyed every bite! And so happy that we decided to stay when they told us there is a 45 min wait :)
Definitely worth it waiting, even for two hours :)< /review><gmap_id>0x80e9ee1b465f55e5:0xe7ad3e74dfc51342<//gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><UserId.>105048448814648987007<//UserId.><Date>1620947310999< /Date></record>

A must try!!!
This place is a hidden gem. The crazy blend of flavours with the intricate simplicity of cooking was outstanding. However, the food isn't the only thing out of the world at this place, the serene ambiance and the calm and caring hospitality in the lap of the mountains makes it a hell of an experience.
Couldn't go wrong at this place😇.

PS - Don't go here when you are in a hurry, the service is slow because of the freshness of the food and the wait is totally worth it.< /review>

<review>Good food but be prepared to wait over an hour for your food to come out. Confirm wait time before ordering. they also have a limited menu. Place order ahead of time and make sure you confirm your order several times. They tend to forget.</review>< response>

<Text>Wonderful experience. The food is delicious - I particularly loved my Thai curry - and they were so sweet and gave us a mango lassi, bread, and bananas for our son when he became impatient waiting for food. I would recommend ordering in advance as the food takes time to come, however when it does, it’s worth the wait.<//Text>< Pics>

Red Dot was a recommendation by Google and boy was it a good one. My roommates and I traveled to hike near by and had a very productive hike aka nature walk in snow. As such we built a appetite only a amazing meal could help. I'm not a adventurous eater and ate pancakes from this amazing menu. And had amazing service from every single person we encountered in the staff. But best believe I'll be more adventurous and explore the menu more when I visit again. Love this place already. I can only imagine how much more I'll love it when I fully try the menu. So if possible order pancakes and there Thai Tea omg 😲it was game changing. Plus the Chai all warm and aromatic was also a nice end to a amazing meal. Until next time 🥰</text>

I and my husband have fallen in love with this restaurant, food is authentic and so flavorful, whole place has positive vibes and the hosts/family   are so welcoming. We don't mind driving an hour to reach here. We had dinner near the outdoor fire place on a winter night, and took back some nice memories. Thanks to the whole Red Dot team</review>

The standout dish was the bread pakora and it was so unique with the sweet and sour and fried bread texture and onion rings!

The ambiance was nice and at the end we also got free bananas.

<text>I called wanting to make reservations if necessary for dining in during covid, it’s my moms birthday & she wants to see the snow... I asked if there was still snow on the ground because we’re not from/in the area & the manager, Mia, literally snapped at me and said “You know what, that’s a really great question for California Highway Patrol, so you should call them and not me, don’t you think?”

Super duper rude. Definitely will be finding somewhere else to take my mother for her birthday.< /text>< rating>

Phenomenal food! If you’re passing by and have some time to spare, there aren’t any better restaurants within fifty miles.
They hand make every order from scratch and have only one chef, so it’s definitely a bit of a wait. To make up for it they have a beautiful patio to wait at, you can call in your order, or you can even wait in your car.
My wife and I elected to wait in the car, and because we said we were hungry when ordering they brought each individual dish out to us the moment it was ready, instead of waiting for everything to be done. Truly superb food, service, and attitudes. We’re definitely going back!< /Review>

Just stopped here on a whim while taking a weekend trip to Pine Mountain.  Living in Los Angeles, a health food hub, I’m shocked to have just had one of the best vegetarian meals I’ve ever had in a town with a population below 3000!  I can’t say enough how good this food is.  The lentil soup was some of the best I’ve ever had.  All of the ingredients tasted so fresh and on top of the food the staff was very kind.  Will be stopping by again on our way out on Sunday.  Cannot recommend enough!< /review>

If ANY restaurant has served everyone in a party, appetizers, entree’s, desert, and the final bill comes and one person ( me) whom was there for their birthday and who ordered first was not served their dinner because they forgot, THAT makes for a very unpleasant experience. Being gracious I said YES I would still like my dinner. The seating was outside and, by this time, everyone were freezing(temp. In the 30’s) but all set outside waiting for me to finally have my dinner over an hour after everyone else had finished.
BUT, I was charged for my dinner.
The expectation is, of course, that you pay for the food that you eat. That would be assuming everyone is served during the same time frame as liberal as that should be. If all people in a party ( 5 in this instance) have to wait until all have finished eating ant then wait for one more person in that party to begin their dinner order, that dinner order should be complimentary.
Did I eat the food, yes. Was it good, yes. Was it painful for 4 others to sit outside in 30 degree weather for an hour to wait for one person to eat, yes.
In my opinion, this place owes me one free dinner. My advice to anyone going here is to request visual confirmation that their order is being cooked. If not, you too may not receive dinner for hours after you have ordered and everyone else in your party has finished like me.
Cheers,

Lovely place in Frasier park, great place to stop by on your way to LA (or back). A bit pricey but the food is fully vegetarian, organic, healthy, filling and palatable. The owners/servers are really kind and explain the significance of the restaurant with all the different options and give their recommendations. There's space for around 40 people (officially, although the place looks like it can seat half of that) and there's a child's playhouse too. You can buy some of their home made ghee and other things for sale. Overall, excellent food and service!<//Text>

<text>There was a review that said “run, don’t walk” to this place
When I tasted my Curry Tofu with chickenless chicken my brain exploded and that’s all I could think.
The Mango Lassi  is a must!

Run! Don’t walk to this place!

Literally probably the most amazingly delicious food. We drove specifically to try this place and am glad I did.
If you are anywhere near this place , stop by.

Freshly made from scratch, so takes a little longer but worth the wait.
Generous portions
Super kind people and great service. I can go on and on but I won’t
So much goodness in this little joint , we’ll be back soon!< /text></record></dataset><record>

If you are in the area, MAKE SURE YOU STOP HERE!!!! Everything was excellent. The food was delicious and worth the wait. The potatoes are well seasoned and perfect. The tapioca pudding is slightly sweet and yummy. The buckwheat pancakes with coconut syrup and fresh fruit is also delicious.<//review>

< review>
Great hospitality.Really appreciate the warm welcome and great views.The snow clad mountains were a spectacular view .They even gave bananas at the end of the meal to carry along for the way which was a sweet gesture.

However food was not upto the mark.The aaloo parantha lacked flavor.We had ordered the cheese jalapeno paratha but due to a mix up in the kitchen they offered us aaloo parantha.The mint chutney though tasted fresh did not taste like a traditional mint chutney. The Malaysian thupka was very spicy.The service was delayed and took nearly 35 minutes to get the food although we were the only customers at that point.

If you wish to experience great views and heartwarming hospitality visit this place, however the food was below expectation in our case.They do offer great variety in menu though</review>

<text>Be patient, this is not fast food. If you want faster service call ahead of time and place your order. The chef really cares about the food and each entree was full of flavor. We had the pakora as a appetizer. I will return and order two next time, it was that delicious. We shared the tofu curry, the classic Chinese Kung Pao, and the beef less Mongolian stir fry. Let me tell you, sharing food is the best way to experience this place.<//text><Date>1609130753737< /Date>< UserId.>

It's not just "minute-maid", it's also very tasty!
All fresh and home-made as you order (not in advance), everything is vegetarian, some even vegan or gluten-free. They even produce their own cheese!
As everything is cooked right before you, you might encounter a little delay, but believe me, they are other things to enjoy there while waiting

Whole story: I guess"Come as a guest, leave as a friend" has never made so much sense to me since I met these guys. I found this restaurant, by googling "vegetarian restaurants" while staying at Lebec, and here it pops. I was surprised by their grades and here I am giving them 5 stars myself.
We tried the restaurant once and we went there ever after every mornings and nights during our stay.
So we had the time to talk food with the Chef and also about the spirit that goes along with this place, because it's important.
I've never felt so good in restaurant! It feels like the one and only preoccupation of the team is your well-being
About the food what can I say... Whatever you choose, you'll never be deceived. Everything's tasty and fresh, made before you as you ordered and some are even home-made (like the cheese).
In case of doubt or trouble choosing, just ask the Chef, he'll give you the best advice to suit your taste</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCIfgD6R57nz9bBtE-47YWkQySm3iGFBB1PfiJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODWQ9lrua5nFLvX77GYRtPDIcKFdTdMYhLBfKK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNja3Q51nmvsSytCuTep2OnBc9yiIIbKoCqt9c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs2QxP7MBHlf3Sg3iz_b9bHTzfzKPNvHhkVwxP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVqGOw0oFe1ZirC3lUMhwABi4yvWUgOvKTeHQ2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9oB-_56wtJgKiXOE045VlL6mtn1U5p-cnbwjM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2rMxUaTZzyiZGWqHBIAJi283PIcgJHx6U9gW8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZr7FHYGkMleJPXZO7MVbNbzZOMi-oEVApPbw-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHN6Dj7bLSQjp8m6fbB8o88esLcS7Rh53HU-Fz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcZjNPInsrj_3oRuTDDdpPZdsSCt7VeoJSoZos=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf9VDlS1hKKpQGyJZvkvw8Uhv9FmkMm4iqLfHs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN52WHDW93DuS3WdygvaCD-b6MDowGTLUdlwNmH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

This is the definition of Korean comfort food. It has a very home made flavor - clean and authentic. Also very simple. Nothing fancy. But a bit expensive, considering how simple it is.<//Review>

So good! The beef-less bulgogi bowl was excellent along with the fresh made naan bread. Will definitely be coming here again and would highly recommend. The only thing is order ahead because it was a long wait for food but well worth it.<//Text>

One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The food is out of this world. I've had curry everywhere (well, except India). It's the best I ever tried. The tapioca is also a gift from heaven. Service is attentive and sweet. I hope I can come back soon. It's indeed a hidden gem.<//text>

Great place to eat vegan food. They only have one chef though and it's a tiny restaurant so don't go there if you're in a hurry. Love it, great presentation and flavor.<//text>

<review>🔴 is the only reason I could see myself living here in this area. Their food is THAT good! We had, over back-2-back dinners, Daal, Curry Tofu, Saag Paneer, Stuffed Paratha, Pad Thai and their amazing Fire Roasted Eggplant. Everything was incredibly tasty and made with love. Even my kiddo's mac n' cheese and pizza! We love this place and I am pretty sure you will too.<//review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>This was a cozy little place that had the most delicious food. The bread pakodas and the samosas were outstanding, i relished every bite. The dal soup was so tasty too. The thaali would be a good choice for a nice heavy meal that is also not too spicy. The chef personally came out to have a conversation with us seeing us enjoy the food so much. She told us about how they prepare the food, and how much effort goes into each individual dish (that they prepare from scratch for every order). It was a lovely evening overall, I highly recommend this place. PS: Try out their chutneys that they sell in big jars, people come all the way from SF to buy them!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk3abSBGgihSsYIYwWwNrHaaxUpNJbtDbXp80B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtqop9Yewh-3GUrNFUGkPgijRVR7m7SrH2uizo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwMokhBvPEafEkRUk0tZyNIOJVig9gjjpDvUQv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFp26k1NWZPfT2vbFioeqVbV4leKqoMZefaKfs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkj9SOabLVm5GrMQqr3lE-y4M7sWcz4IzZvovH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Yum. I ate here a few years ago on my way to camp at Mt. Pinos.  So after a recent long hike I had to stop by and pick up some take-out sauce to bring home with me.  The mango-sticky rice they gave me while I waited was sensational.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy a full meal.</review>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Bottom line: food was killer and the staff was super nice.

4/5 because we waited quite a while to get the food.

It is also a little on the more expensive side but I didn't deduct a star for that, just be aware. It may be worth it for you. Apparently they make everything from scratch there, including the sauces and fake meats which were killer. In my opinion it justifies the cost.< /review>< user_name>

We were there for lunch now that's probably my favorite new place. I wish they had one in La. It's so so so so so delicious and the people working there are some of the nicest people I've ever met.  And. When we told them we're going camping they gave us a bunch of free bananas and apples for the road.< /Review>

This restaurant has very kind owners and wide variety of vegan options. It also has a very relaxing ambience and beautiful views of the nearby mountains. In terms of food, I recommend the Malaysian Laksha and the Tofu Curry.< /text>

Pretty good, I understand the middle eastern concept they were going for and commend them for their efforts.. Although the menu was confusing for me because they've come up with their own names for traditional dishes. Over all we had a pretty good experience. Great food and reasonably priced..<//text>

<review>The Red Dot is hard to explain.  I love places like this because you can not describe it, but 100% (maybe 200%) worth the effort to get here.  We started with a hand made pizza.  Actually we biked to the restaurant from I-5 all the way up a long hill in a single gear bike.   We called ahead to check hours and after making sure they were open the cafe suggested that we order our appetizer now and it will be ready when we got there.   Thank God for that, it was a long hill and by the time we got there we devoured the pizza.  We sat outside in our bike gear and ordered a few more things Tofu Curry, finally Pad Thai.  All made to order all excellent!

I was reading a few things about the cafe and Frazier Park California.  Everything was calm, polite, easy going everywhere we went.  At first I thought I was transported back to the 60's into a hippie commune.  Then I though a cult had taken over the town.   On both cases I was wrong.  Just friendly people far enough away from LA, SF and other cities to remind you that Life Is Good.

So please take the time and go out of your way to eat and visit a wonderful place with wonderful people and wonderful food.

Oh yeah, I kept forgetting to take pictures of the food.  When ever the food showed up we dug right in.  By the time I remembered to take a picture either there was nothing  left...nothing, or the picture​ would not have photographed well.   Yes no pictures = we licked the bowl...Really!

We did not get dessert, we usually do not but was tempted.  We were surprised to get 2 delicious bananas, truly unexpected and awesome.

We stayed till the sun was low on the patio and the fog was sweeping in down over the bills from the Pacific then went over to our bikes in search of beer.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The friendliest people you will ever meet. Great selection of dishes, teas. Just a couple miles off Interstate 5 mid Grapevine. This appetizer was unbelievably delicious. Highly recommended for great food with Asian and India accents.<//Review>

<Review>This is a special place to eat. The staff is very engaging and friendly. The atmosphere is quaint and comfortable. The food is fresh, healthy, hearty and very tasty! The Chai is excellent! Everyone took great care in preparing, presenting and delivering to me my food and drink. There is pride and conscientiousness written all over this establishment. It's kinda like going for a home cooked meal. Red Dot had been recommended to me for almost a year by multiple people and I'm glad I finally gave it a try.  Quickly on my way to being a regular no doubt...< /Review>< pictures>

We were passing through after doing some Condor viewing up near Bitter Creek refuge. We packed plenty of food but we decided to find a joint for some grub to warm us up after our adventure.  We stumbled across the Red Dot and it was the perfect spot.  Everything our party of 5 ordered was absolutely delicious.  Each dish is prepared from scratch. I plan on returning to this gem as often as possible.  If you get the opportunity to eat here, don't miss it!< /Review>

First time eating the food here and it was delicious! I ordered ahead on the phone and they were very friendly. I got the Tikka masala with home-made paneer and it was sooooo good. I also got their Thai sticky rice and it was the best! I did not know that this small community had a vegetarian restaurant after all the years of visiting...so glad I checked Google! I will be back!< /review>

This place is a hidden gem.  We were in town for the weekend competing in the Spartan races.  We happen to be staying at the motel right next door and were googling where to eat.  Went there for breakfast Saturday morning and ended up coming back 3 other times because everything on the menu is delicious. The shakes were made fresh the old mill was the nominal and the flat bread pizza I would recommend anyone.<//Review>

I come here whenever I'm in the area and am always pleased. If anything though, it's gotten even better. this time around I had the tofu curry with garlic naan and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long while. The chai is also delicious and the service is always always kind and efficient. Can't recommend this place enough!< /text>

One issue though: they take their time making food so don't go here if you're in a hurry.
This place is run by a Hindu spiritual group and the head chef is from India.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

So kind and such great service as well as a super chill atmosphere❤️< /Text>< Pics>

Exaggerated reviews? Not for this place. Because the food is made by hand for each other, it is amazing. And yes, it did have a bit of a wait, but it's not from pre-cut, pre-portioned veggies in a baggie; this is the real deal. 100% vegetarian and as an omnivore, had that not been part of the title of the restaurant and some of the dishes, I would not have known that my "beef" shwarma was a beef substitute; it honestly had a better texture and I caught myself wondering when I was going to bite into a piece of gristle and was surprised when I didn't. That's how true to taste this place is. 11/5 stars.</Text>

<text>Great food in a place with great view of the mountains. Loved having healthy vegan options to choose from. Kids friendly too. The service was so friendly with a smile. If you are driving, calling in advance and placing an order helps. Food takes a while to prepare - almost an hour or even more.< /text>< pictures>

Do not expect a quick dining experience. They begin preparing your meal when you order it. The good is excellent, the people are kind and peaceful, the atmosphere is lovely. Go there expecting to relax and enjoy the moment. You will not be disappointed.</text>

The menu has plenty of variety.  It is fresh, quality food made on the premises.  When I go there, I get the feeling they truly care about their customers, no matter if it's a cup of tea or a banquet.  I make special requests and they always accommodate me.  Meal prep is slow, but it IS WORTH IT!  You can call ahead and they'll get it started if you're in a hurry.  I very highly recommend this restaurant.</review>

This place was a real surprise driving around Mt Pinos. Their food is, to all appearances, totally home-cooked, and tastes that way. And it is way underpriced. Their vegan stuff is excellent: we (me + wife) got a "beef stroganoff" with mushrooms and alternative cream sauce, and cleaned the plate together. Because there was enough for two. I don't know how this restaurant exists but I'm glad it does.</Text>

This was my first visit.  I gave them a 4 because I didn't actually sample the food.  They said it would be a 1.5 hour wait for food (not to sit down, but to get the food after ordering). They said they had a large catering order. I decided just to get a tea.  They did a great job with it.  Really yummy.  The staff was really courteous and genuinely seemed to care about all their customers.  Next time I will give the food a try.<//text>

<text>This place has a good variety of Indian vegetarian food. Very polite people. Feels more devoted. The food is really good. One small issue with the place is the time to deliver the good if more. It better to order and then pickup.

But a place you should try all the comfort foods. But pricey too.< /text></record>

< review>
Was out visiting family off the 5. And was looking for something light to eat (it's 105 out!) Found this gem hidden out here. We have since made the trek out from the LA area two more times in the following weeks. The drive was surprisingly fast and the food is amazing. The tabouli is the best I've ever had. But it's not just good Indian food. The stuffed mushroom caps were equally as good and the buckwheat pancakes with fresh fruit has the best homemade "syrup" I've ever had. I know I'm sounding fanatical  but you really don't want to miss out on this place! Skip the gas station food and treat yourself!<//review>

I still remember the first time I came here. I was absolutely blown away by the quality of food and service. All I can say is, if you haven't tried this restaurant: let your guard down and walk in with an open mind. You will not be disappointed. As a first time go, I'd most certainly recommend sitting down and just simply taking everything in.</text>

Happy to have diverged from the highway to have lunch at this charming restaurant. Fresh ingredients are prepared to order. Would definitely make it a regular place to go to when in the area.
A lot more to this place than meet the eye. Find out for yourself. You will not be disappointed.</Text>

The food is amazingly delicious, staff is super friendly.  I felt so at home here and cannot believe the incredible hospitality my family and I received while here.  They even had a little playhouse inside for the kids to play in while waiting for food.  Not a fast stop as everything is made fresh right when you order.  Great place to relax.  Will definitely come back next time we're in the area.  Wish they were closer to us!</Review>

This is the best place in a 20 mile radius. The food is outstanding and the menu is very diverse. Everything is made from scratch like they did in the old days. So glad I found this place. Did I mention the prices are not bad.< /review>

Overpriced. Won't let you bring any outside drinks in. Decent food, but I think the owner/organization are crooks, strongly suggest you avoid. Fake spiritual types, very judgemental, creepy.<//Text>

<Review>Just a hop up the hill for one of the best vegetarian restaurants Ive ever visited. Everything is made fresh and the quality of attention here shows in the quality of food. The staff clearly resonates with passion and care for their craft, and it was a real joy to eat here. Thank you so much. I will return!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

So the second time I called 45 minutes in advance and placed my order, half of the food was there when I arrived and the rest was served promptly. They have a very extensive menu, everything is delicious, I love their samosas as well as freshly baked nan and hummus, the mango lassy is a drink and dessert in one! Best place to eat when in the area.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

There’s something special about this place. Not just the delicious food, but the love that radiates all over.
The samosas were delicious couches pillows filled with perfectly spiced ingredients. Still waiting for the veggie burrito.
Thank you...<//review>

This friendly as close to home cooking as you can get establishment is our go to place when we're in the area, and I'm as carnivorous as the next guy. They're magicians in selecting just the right seasonings to make one forget that God made cows so tasty. We've tried at least half the menu so far and recommend it all, especially the crispy lightly breaded pakaros and the freshest naan you could possibly get. If you're adventurous ask for the regular lassi that has black salt.< /Text>

My type of restaurant through and through. All fresh ingredients, healthful plates, absolutely what I needed after feeling crumby during a long drive. I eat for health and for happiness and see food as medicine. I needed this place!

They also sell lots of jams, and salsas and even ghee all made in house. A must try if you don't eat meat or are knowledgeable about ayurvedic diets..
I'm truly glad to have found the Red Dot. Thank you🖤<//text>

In this jungle of burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches,fried chicken,and pizza (not that there is anything wrong with that)  :) there is a vegetarian indian ,restaurant that is really good!! They have filled a niche here, and have done wonderfully. My curry dish was delicious! with the perfect balance of spicy and sweet, and the naan bread worked fantastic with my dish. Even if you are not a vegetarian, I believe you will enjoy the food at The Red Dot!!</review>

<text>Someone named Mia answered my phone call a few minutes ago and she was VERY VERY RUDE!!! I was in the middle of my sentence when she cut me off spoke over me and hung up on me. I'll be calling back to speak with the manager or owner and hopefully it's not her because that would be a crying shame if she were that awful and had any title. If and when we do go to fraizer park we certainly will NOT eat there. You couldn't pay me to now.</text>< pics>

Very good food, wonderful staff and service, my only beef is that they're kinda slow if you are on a schedule, so either order ahead or tell them you need food sorta fast.  I'd give them five stars but that was something I could not get over--my issue, I know. Lovely atmosphere.< /Text>

<review>Best place to relax, meditate and then indulge into vegetarian delicacies offered by Red Dot! A little detour on I-5 to Frazier Park is well worth it. Make sure you arrive with ample of time if you are a big group. It’s a small place so it may take some time to serve food but it’s all worth wait. Don’t forget to check out all the chutneys and aachaars. We tried lotus root aachaar and it was yummmmm! This is our regular spot to relax & recharge on the way to LA.< /review>< Resp>

We drove from Bakersfield to try The Red Dot.  It was worth the drive.  We had the Pakora for starters.  What a lively flavorful dish.  It was a big portion.  I had the mixed Mushroom Soba for the main course.   The mushrooms were perfectly prepared and delicious.  A great  Vegan dish.</Review>

You don’t believe the reviews? Well, you should! The selection of food is great, it tastes havenly delicious and it’s healthy. What could you ask more? Oh yeah, the staff! They are great, super friendly. Absolutely all the chefs came to see how everything was and at the end one of them came to our car, ready to leave, and gave us 3 baby bananas lol small gestures make a big difference.</text>

We read each review, accept it and share our feelings with each other. After reading your review we only wish one thing. We wish you had informed the kitchen of your raw parathas and wish you had not eaten the Dal and instead asked to have it seasoned to your taste.'}< /resp><username>Anshul Goel< /username><text>Sorry just didn't work for me. I ordered 1 hours in advance and they assured our food would be ready when we arrive, but it was not. They took an hour to make 3 breads and 1 curry. We had ordered 1 curry and never received it. We kept asking when it will arrive and they said it will be here soon. And in the end when all our food was done, they said that there was some confusion and no one made that dish.
Food -
dal/lentil - was tasteless. It was bland and no spices at all. The quantity was good, but what do we do will a large bowl of tasteless dal.
Paratha (aloo and paneer) - they were raw from inside. Where I'm from, we eat paratha everyday for breakfast. This is not how it should be made. It was disappointing to eat and highly overpriced for what was served.
Their menu is vast. They have so many dishes, yet no expertise. I would suggest they have less dishes and make it to perfection and justify the price point for each item.</text>< GmapID>

We showed up and the place was empty so I started out skeptical, I don't typically like vegetarian, but my little sister had been before and it's one of her favorite places. We had a family of 6 with all different tastes so we decided to all get our own thing and share. First they brought out the appetizers and I honestly would have been fine with eating those all night because the samosas were filling and the pakora was absolutely delicious. We swapped drinks, my favorite was the iced Thai tea but their mango Lassi helped cool us all down. We all ordered different dishes and passed them around, everything was beyond delicious and extremely filling. The staff really made us feel like part of the family it was by far the best restaurant experience I've ever had!<//Review>

So glad we found this place. A refreshingly different take on Indian vegetarian food. I have tried lots of Indian food options in California and I have admit this is one of the best. Fennel chai was too good and so was the tofu vada! The service was fantastic. Highly recommended.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>The intention behind this restaurant's existence is so very refreshing. I had no clue what this place was about upon entering and I only decided to try it because I was craving pizza, and pizza was on the menu.

Long story short, these people are a gift to humanity. The day I arrived was already a monumental day for me, so when I honestly answered 'yes' to the question 'are you still hungry?' I was blown away by the overflowing generosity that followed (I was burning huge amounts of calories due to cycling over the, literally frozen, Los Padres mountains; part of a much larger bicycle tour).

They also incorporate "pay what it is worth to you" items on their menu, which too was very refreshing. They support good agricultural practices (non-gmo) and have a strong Middle Eastern influence; plus they make their own cheeses!
Support this crew if you have the notion.<//Text>< pics>

The vegan samosas, vegan naan, and vegan Malaysian laksa were absolutely phenomenal. Many have cited slow service. We stopped on our way back from San Francisco to LA on Tuesday around 3:30pm and were the only ones there and food came out quite quickly actually. We also had the cooler of the day which was watermelon strawberry and it was delish! So fresh. The staff was very kind as well. I wish it was closer to our home in LA so I could visit more frequently. I’ll definitely be returning though! It’s worth the 2 hour round trip. That’s how good it was. Sooooo flavorful it’s incredible. Open another in LA please? My only knock is that *some* items, not all, are priced far too high for this level of dining. It makes it not worth it to try the item and a shame in my opinion. We had lunch for 2 with appetizer and drinks and had leftovers for $50 including tip. So not bad, but also not cheap and we avoided some of the pricier things. I’d suggest management make tweaks to the recipe to use lower cost alternative items that can lower the price of certain dishes. $11 for a dessert is what you pay at a trendy, high end restaurant in LA or Miami, not at a casual restaurant in a tiny town on truck route. Even for organic and vegan, I’d say $8 max. Which, being in the food biz myself, you should always price menu items at 5x cost. So if 2 samosas cost $1.50 to make (overestimating here for quality) then that’s $7.50. Anything more than that is too high. Anyway, I’ll be back! Thanks for having us!<//text>< Pics>

Best multi-cuisine vegetarian restaurant period... Conveniently located off of I-5 as you travel between So-Cal/Nor-Cal (near the Tejon pass), the taste and the quality of food is amazing. We tried their yummy pakoras, cheesy naan with sweets and tangy marinara, nachos, falafel plate with the best hummus I've had and jalapeño paratha with the rightly spiced daal. All the food was so delicious that my 7 year old usually picky eater kept on praising the food and said that we need to stop by on our drive back home!!!</Review>

We had Veg Thali & The best Sarso ka saag with naan. We were amazed when we heard Hanuman Chalisa playing in the background. The women (foreigners)  there were dressed in Shalwar Kameez (Indian attire) with bindi etc which was again very refreshing. The food was great tasting. Harman who was assisting us in deciding the dishes was very helpful & has an Indian connection. Overall a great experience. Strongly recommend.<//Text>< Pics>

Simran and all the staff were so cheerful and prompt that make your experience more enjoyable. Thanks Simran for packing up all the Kheer  and Sticky Rice as a complimentary to go,  it was the best for me and my daughter.

Customer service (Robert and new fellow) was friendly, listened well, present, attentive. Service was timely. My concerns, minor as they were, were addressed. Cost is always a concern for me tho I understand it. Discount appreciated. Appreciate shuttling. Driver Joe was affable.</review>

Best Deals around! Been to 3 different dealers looking for a diesel, they had the best deal,  a better truck and were great to work with. They were also very kind and professional, we would definitely come back and recommend to our friends.< /review>

<text>Told me part for my car was back ordered for 2 weeks. Over two weeks later and still no part. I can’t drive my car without this part. Have called twice now and have been told they will check and call me back. No time frame what so ever. No calls. Wish I read the reviews for the service department and took it elsewhere.<//text><rating>1< /rating>< GmapID>

I purchased a used vehicle from here on 08/02/20. After completion of purchase, I’m only given one complete key (meaning remote and key that fits into the remote) and one key without remote control. That key without the remote is completely useless. It cannot start the engine or disable the alarm or unlock the vehicle.

In the following week after purchase I requested a manager to see if they can locate the missing remote. They said they will look into it. No one bother to give me a call back or update me whether remote was found or not.

Two and a half weeks later I received a call requesting to bring the vehicle back in because they need to register it with the DMV. I had to take half a day off work and drive 70 miles there and will be 70 miles back home. I really don’t think filling up my gas and a car wash compensates for my time, the hassle, and frustration.

I finally get back the vehicle with a never seen before dent on the driver side door. Thanks for nothing and the added dent to my vehicle Volkswagen of Hayward.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1598083173941, 'text': "Hi Ann,\n\nThank you for taking the time to bring in your vehicle to be reviewed by DMV to complete the registration process, as they were closed when you bought the vehicle, and your business again.\n\nWe're glad you came in to take advantage of our no haggle up front lower priced than market value Dodge Caravan you purchased.\n\nUnfortunately DMV was not completely open at the time you made the purchase and inorder to complete the registration, the vehicle needed a VIN # verification to be done by DMV. Unlike other dealerships, we wanted to compensate you with a full tank of gas and a full detail to show you that we care, 2 weeks after you made the purchase.\n\nWe are sorry to hear about the damage caused to your vehicle and we did see that the dent on your door had yellow paint marks, as if a yellow pole or yellow wall did the damage. We verified with you that we do not have any yellow poles or yellow walls that would have caused that damage. We also we verified our local DMV office and gas station, which does not have any yellow poles or yellow walls to cause the damage.\n\nThe damage is more consistent with the yellow poles that are available at a Home Depot loading area which is in line with the large amounts of lumber that were in the back of your van when you brought the vehicle in.\n\nWe are here to take care of our customers and would like to help you out by offering our paintless dent removal at our cost for you to use vs paying retail value elsewhere.\n\nPlease let us know if you would like to use the paintless dent removal, have any questions or concerns.\n\nBest\nAbby Mujadadi"}< /resp>< gmap_id>

This is a response to Abby from the review below.

Completely fabricating your story. There was no damage on the vehicle upon drop off. You guys do a  thorough inspection on arrival prior to receiving the vehicle. If that damage was already there it would have been disclosed on your report.

Your business is fully aware of the dispute and this situation has gone all the way to your general manager who has agreed to fix the damage. I'm grateful from the help of Robert Aponte ( Service manager) to take care of customers and damage that took place while vehicle was under Volkswagen of haywards care.

The fact that there were 2x4's in the van you decided to upload a picture of home depot because they have yellow poles is petty. There are yellow poles in various parking lots and locations. One various location that has yellow poles would be smog stations. The fact of the matter is that I have proof that the vehicle was smogged yesterday while in your possession. We were never informed that this was going to take place prior to dropping it off and after we picked it back up with damages. So you personally need to get your facts straight before insulting us with your fabricated opinion and accusation.</Review>

Found a used pick up truck on website that was listed for less than it was displayed on the lot. Connie assisted me while I checked and tested the truck I liked and reffered me toJay who agreed w/ me with website price list(4k less). Jay was professional, very nice
And friendly. See Jay or Sammy if you happen to stop by this dealership. They will work anything out to satisfy their customers. Thanks Jay!!!</Text>

<text>First and foremost, I have to state that I have been purchasing automobiles, boats, and motorcycles from dealerships over the past 23 years. Our experience at Team Volkswagen will be one of our favorite and most memorable. My fiance and myself where in the market for a new SUV for our family. We traded in our 2015 Prius for a nice SUV that we had picked out on the lot earlier.  Vlad and Sami both made the experience very easy and stress-free. Though I have been making purchases for years, this was my fiance's first time at a dealership.

The negotiating was simple and Sami did everything he could to get us a great low APR, easy affordable payments, and was generally concerned with our happiness. More dealerships should have employees and managers like Team Volkswagen does. This was really a hassle-free and enjoyable experience. We love our new vehicle, and my fiance has been telling all of her friends and family about how much she enjoyed everything from picking out our SUV to putting our names on the contract. Sami gave us a fantastic deal on our trade in and even cheked back with us to make sure we where enjoying our new ride. Kudos to this dealership!

I also want to point out that I've read a lot of the negative reviews on here and I have to say that just because your credit is bad, or your financial history is poor, is no reason to blame VW Hayward. They can only work with what they are given. We seen a lot of very happy couples like us smiling when they where handed their keys, or being shown around the lot by the friendly staff. There is literally no word of truth from these nay-sayers.

Thank you again Team Volkswagen Hayward, that smile you helped put on her face makes me very grateful.</text><userid>117811890645460750892< /userid><date>1556429638095</date><Response>None< /Response><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

I called the sales department for an e-Golf and I got Vlad as my sales consultant. Vlad was quite sincere, knowledgeable about the car, the deal and he does care for his customers, I had a great feelings over the phone. Everything was explained in details, no vague promises or information. I’m moving from a 2017 eGolf SE to a new 2019 SE because of the great deal VW has and the better standard options. The price of the new car after rebates is less than the price dealer gave me for my old car, it’s a no brainer to get the new one.
Vlad explained about the finance and the restrictions for the deal clearly, he got the color that I preferred and promised to get it ready before I came. To make sure everything was good, he recommended us to fill out applications online although we currently have a loan with VW credit. We did and were approved.
When we came, Vlad was charging our new car, the car was detailed and ready. We test drove the car to make sure it’s good. Vlad was explaining all features of the car while we’re driving, he’s a real car enthusiast, not just a salesperson. It’s quite fun and informative test drive.
The dealer is not very big, but everything seems nice, our finance manager was nice and easy, I believe Carla was the name, we’re in/out quite quickly.
The numbers were exactly as quoted and we love the dealer honesty.
When we came out, Vlad was trying to get some glue spots out of the new car that were missed by the detail person, we really appreciated Vlad attention to details.
We would give 5 stars for everything, the best salesperson and the dealer that employs this type of person. It was the most pleasant new car buying experience ever.< /review>

< Review>
We looked at a car one day, decided to buy it the next, and called to say we were coming in to do the paperwork. We planned our visit based on the website, which says open til 7:00. However, they said, 'don't bother coming in, it's 5:30 now and the computer system closes at 6:00'.  The next day Abby called to say the price had increased overnight by $500 and 'there's nothing we can do, but do you still want the car?'. When I complained that seemed fishy, I got feedback about being a 'difficult to deal with person' who is blaming the dealership for their own mistake of not visiting at the right time. 'We warned you the price could change, and 15 people have emailed about that car'.  I was actively discouraged from a purchase, along with a personal critique, so they could hold out for that extra $500. Thank goodness are so many other VW dealers in the Bay Area.<//Review>

If I could give less I would. These guys are all scammers. They pretend to make offers with you then will steal your credit and threaten to “beat you up” when you ask for papers back because the agreement wasn’t true.

ANA, SAMMY, AND MR. HAMID ARE WONDERFUL! If you’re going to the Volkswagen of Hayward, ask for one of these sales folks! Such an amazing experience. I went in to buy a car with extremely low chances or hope of being able to buy one, and this incredible staff went above and beyond for me. They worked with my credit score, worked with my income, even gave me a $0 down payment deal. My girlfriend and I walked away with a brand new 2018 model car. 21 and 22 year old college students who are no longer going to suffer and will finally be able to save money. This team met all of our goals and MORE! 10/10, 5 Stars, so beyond thankful! Volkswagen of Hayward, I’ll see you again soon, and thank you so much!</Review>

Scheduled appointment for a simple oil change, came in time assuming that the service will be performed at scheduled time, after half an hour asked how much time left and was told to wait another 1,5 hours.
This is just an oil change, simplest service ever!
I wish I was told upfront about 2 hours waiting time, knowing this I would go somewhere else, its not worth it. Half of the day wasted!</Review>

Vlad was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I reached out to 4 dealers in the area after hours for lease/buy proposal on Sunday, he responded the next morning by email, text, and voicemail on Monday. The deal was the best out of everyone in Bay Area. I submitted pre-qual credit app that day. On Tuesday we finalized an amazing deal on 2019 e-golf lease. 5 star team at Hayward. Ask for Vlad, he knows what's up.</review>

Never ever give your car for servicing at this establishment if you want to have an better service and customer service. I had my car serviced twice at this establishment. Both times I had worst experience, I don’t know if its mandatory for them do carwash after servicing or not but when I gave my car for first servicing I was expecting to get a washed car after servicing, after the servicing was finished when I went to pick up my car it was not cleaned so I asked the customer rep if he can get my car cleaned, he told me that I should let them know about wash before giving the car to service. The manager overthere heard my conversation with the rep and got my car cleaned. Again I went there for my car 2nd service this time I told them specifically that please perform carwash after the service this time I informed them before giving my car to servicing, when I went to pick up my car its not cleaned, customer rep overthere told me that he would get the car deepclean inside and out , all they did was ran my car in washer and gave me my car and I think thats was they call as deepcleaning.I’ll never recommend this place to anyone not give my car to service at this establishment ever again.<//Review>

< Review>
During Covid-19, my husband and I knew we needed a car for our growing family. We tried to work with other dealers but they didn't care to help or adjust to the current crisis on our search for a car. Through reviews and good word of mouth, I reached out to Sami, an amazing local general manager at VW Team Hayward. We drove all the way from Sacramento because Sami cares about his customers and wants to get you in your dream car on a budget that makes sense for your family. It goes without saying that many other dealerships are not like that and care aboutoney and sales before customer service. I recommend anyone reach out to Sami if you need a car during Covid or after this crisis. He will treat you like family.</Review>

<text>I went in yesterday afternoon to look at potential cars for myself, Ana immediately greeted me at the door. She was so sweet and helpful, she answered every question I had with great enthusiasm and she took the time to help me find the perfect car. I had no intention of getting one so quickly but I could not resist. Ana and her manager Abby were so professional and helpful to me. I highly recommend team Volkswagen of Hayward!< /text><Time>1548126960274< /Time>< user_id>

The staff only cares about new customers, and are apathetic towards old/current clients.

I suggest you go over the lease 2x before signing b/c they will give you false promises and treat you just like a number, not a person. Go to any other VW nearby and avoid this location at any cost.</Text>

I made an appointment to have my car checked out and basically the cost was not worth fixing. However, I ended up trading my car in thanks to Anna, Hamid and Sami. Anna was patient with me throughout the whole process because I was skeptical about trading in my car. They are all very personable and fun to talk to. Anna explained to me in detail the features of my new car and tried to meet my needs w a lowest monthly payment that was possible. I appreciate all the honest answers they gave me and had the process of buying my car to be basically painless.

Thank you Hamid, Sami and Anna. You all are great at your jobs!< /Review>

Our experience here was wonderful. We drove from Phoenix to get a 2015 Passat that we couldn’t find in AZ. We were NEVER told they would hold it for us. They NEVER made us any promises of pricing. What they did was offer us a fair price and took their time with the financing so that they could find my son the best deal for him. They are a family run company so it does seem to be run differently than other dealers. They were very personable and friendly. They never pressured. Just told us what they could do and left the decision to my son.  We were respectful to them and they were respectful to us. Overall, it was a much different experience than other dealers, but satisfying.< /review>

We bought Volkswagen Beetle from them. They lied about most of the factual information about car. We double confirmed with them if the car was certified while purchasing. They faked, and when we went to the service center, we found out the car was not certified. Within one month of purchasing, we had to take the car to service center. When we called them, they turned their back and denied about all information they gave to us while purchasing car. Until all the paper work was done, they didn't tell us that the car didn't have second back up key available. Their customer service is as pathetic. Most sad part is that the manager talks nicely when you go to buy vehicle. And then he doesn't even come on phone after payment is done.< /Text>

TERRIBLE Management. The Managers who sit behind the doors don't even know how to sell anything. Don't even think about taking your car for a trade-in. "The car is worth nothing to us" - that's what they'll say.
WORST management I've ever seen at a dealership. I feel sorry for the sales people working there.
If you are looking for someone who wants to work with you for a good deal, this definitely NOT the place!!
If you call them for their deals, they will lie and say that they will lower it. Just don't even bother.
I have a huge network, definitely spreading the word.
Read all others reviews as well. You'll find the same thing. These people are a SCAM.< /Text>

Original review below... this is in response to Abby.. there was no discussion of certified preowned being an option. You are lying!! The website said certified, and so did the window sticker! It was not until I was in finance I was told that the vehicle is too old to be certified. The vehicle came with a quarter tank of gas and after 50 miles I had to fill the Adblue for diesel! You did NOT take any money off the vehicle. Stop lying and be real with your customers. Also when I call try answering the phone.

I was happy with the sales experience. They were not pushy at all. I was disappointed to find out that the Certified Preowned Car on their website turned out not to be certified preowned, despite saying certified preowned on the window sticker of the car as well. I come to find this out when I'm sitting down to sign the finance paperwork. It would have been nice for them to tell me in advance and/or not falsely advertise. When I got into the car I had just purchased I saw that the gas tank was at 1/4 of a tank! I had to immediately stop and fill up the gas tank. Never have I purchased a vehicle where the dealer let me leave with anything less than a full tank. You would think when you are spending 13k dollars you would be given a full tank of gas to leave with...<//Text>

Don’t do it. You will regret leasing or buying a car from them. Go elsewhere or buy from a private party. They will lie and say anything to you to make you sign papers. They make car dealerships look very bad and give them the bad reputation. Don’t trust them, they just want their commission and will use every trick in the book to trap you into a lease or payment plan. Disgraceful.

Lies - I have received no email from you or voicemail.< /Text>

The manager here is the most irresponsible and dishonest person I have ever met.  When I signed the contract, they promised that I could pick up the car next week, but the car has delayed for a week and he wants me wait one more week. During two weeks after I signed the contract, I gave them at least ten calls and sent countless text messages, and they did not reply.  I came to their store and the manager told me that promise is just promise, it's not guarantee.  I said that we signed the contract and he said that I have the right to cancel the contract.  When I took my contract with my boyfriend and read it sentence by sentence, the manager said, go back to school and study the contract. I have no word to say to such a person. DON’T come to this Volkswagen to make any deal! They are bunch of people who only know how to lie!!!!!!< /Text>

<review>Yesterday, I worked with Sami and his team to do a trade in on my 2015 Golf TSI and a purchase of a new 2019 Passat. I have purchased at least seven cars over the last 30 years from Volkswagen in Texas, Oklahoma and now in California. I have learned that if I come to a dealer prepared and knowledgeable of buying and trading cars, the whole experience proceeds quickly and without a lot of stress.

My experience with Team VW was probably the most efficient and ENJOYABLE that I have ever had. Sami and his team strive to provide exceptional customer service. I will encourage my friends to go to Team VW of Hayward for the purchase and trade in experience. I believe if you advocate for yourself, they will advocate for you with respect and you will be satisfied with the outcome.<//review>< Rate>

<time>1569528947858</time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>My wife and I had a great experience with Vlad from Team VW of Hayward.  Vlad was responsive, communicative, and worked with us to make sure we got the car we wanted.  Additionally, he made recommendations for us in case we had future car needs (body work, paint, etc.).

His manager (Abby) and the GM (Sami) were also supportive and ensured we could pick up the car on our own schedule.

Overall, a very positive experience.  Thanks Vlad.  We would return to VW of Hayward for future car buying needs.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1569534624433, 'text': 'Hello Nick,\nThank you very much.\n\nIt truly was our pleasure to meet such amazing genuine people.\n\nWe hope the very much in your Passat experience and will be here if you need us in the near future.\n\nBest\nAbby Mujadadi'}</Response>< Gmap_id>

I came here to get a chronic door rattling issue fixed in my new VW. The workmanship was not great. This was for a 2018 model year car bought less than 1 year ago new, under a 6 year warranty.

I ended up visiting over 5x since the issue would resurface on the way home from the dealer. Each time I went in, I would have to wait hours and the entire trip would take an entire day. After failing to fix it after the 5 or so times I went in, I was told by the service rep and technician (Danny) that there was nothing else the dealer could do - effectively refusing to fix a problem that came from the factory. We also confirmed with a car on the showroom floor that the rattling was NOT normal.

I took it to another dealer and they immediately diagnosed that the door panel needed replacing. A part was ordered in, replaced, and 3 days later, all was done. Car has been like new since and it's been 1-2 months already.

I've reported this subpar experience to VWoA already.

In summary, unless the work needed to be done is dead simple or you want to waste a ton of time getting nowhere with a fix, stay away from this dealer.< /review>

Wish they had a zero rating- be on the watch for the manager  "Sammie"  straight up crook. Tries to scam your credit score for higher interest rate. King of horrible management. Called me one phone yelling at me about a question I had. Anger management needed.<//text>

Purchasing my new Golf GTI at Team Volkswagen of Hayward was a fantastic experience. The entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about Volkswagen vehicles. Within five minutes of parking on the lot (in pouring rain), I was test-driving the exact car I wanted and purchased shortly after. When it came to closing the sale, their staff was upfront about terms and worked hard to obtain the best possible interest rate for my loan. I am a naturally guarded person, always on high alert for any tricky salesperson tricks. Despite my caution, I never detected any attempts at deception throughout the process.  All questions were answered succinctly to my satisfaction while signing paperwork. Afterward, I received a highly informative demonstration of all of my new car’s features, where I got my phone paired via Blue Tooth. Throughout the entire experience, I felt valued as a customer.  In summary, Team Volkswagen is a truly first-rate dealership, 10/10. I would not hesitate to recommend Team Volkswagen to friends and family.<//text>

<text>Vlad was a rockstar - I was prepared to shop around, but having recently moved to the US was sick enough of the amount of admin I had going on. Vlad was straight up and his best foot forward from the start - answered questions, wasn't pushy...such that when (after lots of back and forth) some more local VW dealers offered to match or even marginally beat Vlad's offer, I still made the journey to Hayward to take Vlad's offer.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Really aggressive sales rep. I understand it's part of your job, but the older balding Afghan man takes it too far too fast. I doubt he would enjoy his sisters/daughters/wife being talked down in the same manner he treats his customers. Work with your customers, not against them and you'll be more successful in your closing ratio. Not my first bad experience with him. I usually do not leave negative reviews, but online presence is everything nowadays, so I hope he reflects on his demeaning tone and foul language for future customers. My family and I will be taking our business elsewhere.< /Text>

I ASKED A WHITE CAR BUT I RECEIVED THE BLACK ONE!
I got disappointed when I leased the car from them. First, I went to Nissan Hayward as they are with the same management and asked for the white Murano. I did the drive test with Roger and I could not lease the car as I did not have sufficient credit score. They suggested to try WV as they have special program for the foreign professionals. Roger took me to VW dealership and I asked to do a drive test with a white Tiguan as I was looking for this color. The white Tiguan was behind the black one in the parking lot and Roger advised to try the black one and if I like they will give me the white car at the end.  After hours of discussion and credit application and paper work I decided to lease the car and I signed the paperwork and when I received the key I was given the black car which I drove in the test. It was late and the manager left. Salesperson (not Roger) tried to call Sammie and he did not answered his phone. I had to take the car and came back tomorrow. It was a huge mistake as I asked for the white car and I received the black car. It is ZERO communication with the employees and managers. When no one asked for the color during the paperwork it means I already selected the white car and also Roger knew I was looking for a white. The day after the lease, I came back for the reason why they gave me the black car and instead of expressing the apology for the mistake they replied "we can not change the color as the car will no longer new and it is already registered and will be considered as the used car." Also the other response was. "The white color is for the rental cars. We gave you a better color." It was the worst experience I ever had in the car shopping. I am looking for the second car to buy but I won't go there again.</Text>

Be careful when you buy a car from this place . I purchased a new car less than 1year ago and took it in for its first service.  In less than a week later my car was hit and I took it to be serviced by the repair company next door.  The repair company noticed that the wheel lock was missing and I called Volkswagen. I received the worst service Sami and George gave me the run around . Sami and George both said they were busy and it took me calling the Corporate office in Virginia to get help. If anyone is interested in buying a car please think twice before buying from them because getting help after you purchase is nonexistent.<//Review>

Great experience with Yveth at Team Volkswagen Hayward. She was completely professional and responsive through the entire process of buying a new car. This was by far the best car buying experience I've ever had at any dealership. It was a quick and no nonsense process all the way. Jay from finance was also very helpful. Thank you both!<//text>

My dog Daizy went missing on mothers day, and she wondered down to this dealership. The wonderful team at Volkswagen welcomed her and took such good care of her. The general manager Abby Mujadadi and his family welcomed her into their home and took care of her till the shelter opened on Tuesday. We are once again a happy family thanks too the love and care of Abby, Samie, Jay, Hamid and Vlad. Thank you all so much for loving and caring for our little Daizy.< /text>

Bought a car with Vlad through TrueCar, it was a relief to be in touch directly with the internet sales manager through the beginning of my purchase. Clear with pricing, great with showing inventory, will showcase trims for all models, and more. 10/10 recommend.</text>

Overall experience during day I walked in to lease an e-golf was good ! Afterwards, the management team is rude and will not be answering your inquiry calls properly and keep you on hold for more than 30 minutes. My model of car was not available in the showroom and I had to make so many calls to get an answer from them on the status of the car when I was really in need of the car for my commute. Inefficient management.</Text>

Came to browse used vehicles in the last few open hours of the dealership, and there was an extremely rude Persian car salesman that pretty much argued with me and insulted me to the point that I would have to put this one-star review on here.

Most sales experience on this lot is equivalent to trying to buy a computer at Fry's - terrible. You're better off going down the road to the Honda or Toyota AutoNation next door.</Review>

<Review>Untrustworthy service and false promises! I went to this dealership for an Atlas Limited Launch Edition model. It was the last one available in the east bay at that time. Went through my company (comcast) as a preferred dealership for discount on the vehicle. They were going to honor the price but for a high monthly payment. I was able to afford it and was leaving out until Finance manager said they found a way for me to buy the car at my desired payment. He said they would lease it to me at $800/mo for 6months then have me buy it from them for $500/mo. No way could I afford $800 for a car note but I really wanted and needed this model. I knew nothing about leasing. I agreed to the deal. I literally went and  got a second job to pay for the car note. I came back six months later and guess what the finance manager told me?! I cant purchase the vehicle for the price I wanted. He said the interest rate went up. Told me to come back in a year. I am now stuck with a $800 car note for a lease for 4yrs!!! I am going to have my company unlist this dealership as a preferred dealership. Never coming back to this dealership again and neither will my other 9,876 coworkers!< /Review>< gmap_id>

We had a horrible experience at team Vw . our college student daughter took in jetta for check engine lite(epc) $ 200 diagnostic fee ? Then expensive repair $ 700 bucks , week later 100 miles driven , same lite comes on, go back 2nd repair another 500 bucks ok , another week goes by battery died go back 250 battery = 1650 for this ? Its a 14 jetta w/40k miles. They did take advantage of her lack of knowledge, we almost filed a complaint with the state if CA (B.A.R) but decided to trade it in on a camry at hayward toyota(autonation) bottom line stay away and beware of team Vw !! Update 4-5-19 , just got reply from owner basically saying the car 2014 jetta w/39k miles dealer serviced by the book ($$$) since day 1, had multiple issues ?  Team be misdiagnosed the jetta the 1st time out , simple check engine lite ? Called said car is ready paid the retail bill , spark plugs $ 700 ? Ok left 100 miles later same lite now its the plug coils ? Another $ 500, then 2 days later dead battery ( missed in initial diagnose) another $ 250 ? We upgraded the car to toyota .Why bring back a car to a dealer that's incompetent ?  And keeps charging us ,We took the team VW sting and decided in our best interest to not to deal with team vw !!  Keep your double talk reply !!< /review>

My Name is Michael and had a GREAT! experience with the Team of Volkswagen of Hayward. I spoke with the General Manager and helped to transfer the title from another person to me and trade it in for a new car. The process was extremely smooth and helpful. I will return again once my lease is up, that's for sure.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I bought a used VW from this dealer. At the 11th hour (9:30 pm actually, and my ride had gone home), the manager refused to offer the price promised by his sales person - and then proceed to explain to me that he does this all the time. It was classic bait-and-switch which I did not expect from a large dealer. The car was nice (yes, I bought it anyway - I was a bit trapped at that point) but I thought others would want to know that they are not honoring their sales people here, so be careful.</Review>< pics>

I came in about two weeks ago to get my Jetta serviced. I saw the original salesman (I forgot his name) but he remembered us and greeted us. He was super helpful and even talked to us for a while and offered us refreshments. I am big on customer service and I thought that was just great that he remembered us and even hung out with us for a bit. Excellent customer service!< /Text>

<Text>I had a very pleasant experience here.  I was helped by Misal who was very attentive and knowledgeable.  He ran through every feature of the car before and after I bought the car.  He even came on his day off to help.  The whole experience and staff ran smoothly.  Truthfully in the end, it really comes down to price and I can say that this place really had unbeatable prices (I visited a number of other dealerships).  This place is worth the trip from San Francisco.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I bought a used 2014 Nissan Murano at the end of August. Soon after driving it off the lot, the car had a problem with the engine. I brought it back and they rebuilt the engine and fixed one of the sun visors for no charge. Within the following week I experienced the car falling out of gear and went back to the dealer.  The General Manager, Sammy was very concerned and said he would replace the car. I’m impressed that he went out of his way to make me satisfied and am now driving a 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan! Thank you Sammy!</text>

It was the best decision to go back to the Hayward Volkswagen Team. With my budget, I was leaning toward used cars, but somehow they did their magic and helped me to buy a brand new Golf 2017! BIG THANKS to the Sales Manager Jay Mujadadi who made this process so simple and easy! Also thank you Moe for showing me important car features. They also asked to stop by whenever for complimentary car washes and other things =) This was a very pleasant car buying experience.< /Review>< gmapID>

The next day they never called and said they did, then told me they had another buyer but if i get there soon it was first come first serve. I showed up told her i was buy  the insurance, she walked off saying ok and disappeared. When the  insurance needed  the vin i was told the car was not there and Norma was gone on a test drive.

<resp>None< /resp><Text>i got a vw jetta on Tuesday 4th September. I got it with a service plan. I wanted to get that plan cancelled, so on Friday when I was picking the car, I asked the sales person 'Vlad' that I want to cancel it but he kept on telling please call us and we will do it.
I called them on Sunday to cancel the plan. I was asking her basic questions politely and she was replying rudely.
When  I say 'you guys' told me to call, she replies 'what do you mean by you, I didnt tell you to call'.
What an amazing service just after couple of days you have bought the car. I wonder why people dont buy from there.<//Text>< Rating>

I did not buy a car here, just parts to repair my Jetta. I do not think I have ever bought a part that they had available. You have to pre-pay and then show up a couple of days later. They are more expensive than online but if it's a small order it's worth it as I do not have to pay for shipment. I always show up with the specific part number I need.
Free coffee in the morning.
While I wait my wife goes to see the new cars and she tells me the sales people are always very nice. Unfortunately VW does not sell Diesels anymore, those were very good cars.< /review>

Worst experience ever. Never go to this dealership. If they don't want to sell the car, they should tell on customers face and instead of making him waste whole day. Manager is arrogant, doesn't respect customer, given lame excuses for getting credit score ex. Its weekend, we cant get credit score, US government changes.. anything which doesn't make any sense.</Text>

I bought a Tiguan from Jay and Sami.  Very good experience.  Great price and no BS approach.  I also bought an extended warranty and they offered a price I could not refuse.  They are willing to negotiate even if their prices are already competitive.</review>

Though I know we could have paid less purchasing elsewhere, we went ahead and got our vehicle at Hayward for the convenience and so we could take delivery before the holiday weekend. As car salesmen go, I was liking Hayward VW more than most. However, things soured quickly, and our holiday weekend plans were ruined.

We purchased our car Tuesday with assurances that we could pick it up the next day. It was being delivered from elsewhere in bay area and we were getting the windows tinted. We had to have the car Thursday for our weekend plans. I texted one of the Salesman Wed. and was told they had the car but the windows had not yet been tinted. I was told definitely Thursday. I did not hear from them Thurs., so I spent 30 minutes on the phone getting passed from one person to another just to find out if my car was still not ready! Somebody had clearly dropped the ball, and they admitted as much. Friday, still no word from them. Again I get bounced around on the phone to find out it will be available late afternoon. I’m pretty outraged at this really crappy service at this point. A car dealership that NEVER calls you. Wow!

It is already getting dark when I’m finally able to get the car, almost empty on gas. In the light of the next day, the car was not detailed very well. They made absolutely no effort to compensate us for ruining our holiday weekend plans! When I complain, they offer to sell me the cross bars roof rack at cost. We never hear from them of course.

A couple weeks later I pull in with a flat tire. The say they can’t do anything about it, put air in it, and send me down the road. I ask how they decided to compensate me for ruining our holiday weekend, and they act mystified at what I’m talking about. HORRIBLE service! Shop elsewhere!</text>

I went to Volkswagen dealership at Hayward California today at 5pm and I was treated like I was second rate Chinese trash. I was looking at a used 2010 Nissan 370z black convertible. I went there with two other friends. I did a full personal inspection on the vehicle including checking the muffler, coolant cap, engine cap, sound of the engine, the top, the exterior, and the bottom of the car. One of the dealer asked my friend with a disgusted look on this face "does your friend always do this?" To be honest the car is far from excellent condition but I was willing to work with it. During the test drive there was squeaking to the left rear of the car and the dealers keep insisting it was loose change in the rear. We figured out it was the convertible top that was causing the squeaking but had intentions to trying to rush me out. THE WORST PART IS THAT THEY OFFERED 20K WHEN THE ONLINE AD WAS 18K. I PROVIDED COUNTER OFFER OF 17K AND THE DEALER SAID "goodbye", did a 180 degree turn and walked away. So Volkswagen, do you have a policy where the customers are not allowed to pre inspect the car? Do your dealership treat my cash as no good when I offered them cash? Does your dealership allow your dealers to treat your customers like garbage? I went to Toyota, Honda, and Nissan and they always allowed me to pre inspect their vehicles to my heart intent, offer me water and amenities, and when we can't make a deal, smiled, walk me to my car, and hand me their business card. At that Volkswagen dealership I had none of that and all bullcrap.< /review>

This is a review of the Service Department:

Went to the dealership because my mechanic couldn't fix an electrical problem with my vw golf.  The first person I dealt with was Romeo, who was very helpful and nice and scheduled my appointment (they were all booked up for the day).  I went in the following monday and Robert helped me.  He was very nice, and answered all my questions and offered me a shuttle to take me home while I waited!
They fixed the problem by lunch and I was on my way.  I always felt like everyone was being respectful and they even fixed my license plate!<//text>

Ohh Man where would I start my story, I wish I can say zero star. I went there to get car on lease Golf GTi the price on car is $33,750 dealer asking price here come the deal from them $2800/- down payment + drive off &$595+tax month API now do maths $21420+$2800down payment+$3500/- tax(approximately) So by end of the 36 months I will be ending in paying 84.7% approximately the car retail value still I will be returning the car. It's was really pathetic experience of my life.waste of time , waste of energy. Such a dumb people who believes the customer who are walking by are dumbo and they can through whatever numbers they feel right.second The guy name "David" took 50 minutes by going back and forth to bring these numbers. They should understand the customer is your guest so treat them as guest not as victim by putting on hold and waste their time. It was said it takes several years to build customer but takes only 30 seconds to loose.< /Text>

<review>Big shout out for Team Volkswagen of Hayward!  This was my first major car purchase of my life and I was nervous.  Yvette was such a sweetheart and helped put me at ease without pressuring me.  Jay talked numbers with me and was fair and open to my requests.  Sami did all the paperwork with me and the time flew by as we laughed and chatted.  But most importantly, I got a great deal and left feeling like I have a team that will help me out if any issues come up.  Thank you team VW of Hayward!</review>< rate>

Bad experience overall. Asked whether they have the golf R.  They have two 2016.  Asked if cars have the new driver assistance features.  The manager said no, not even for the 2017.  We said we read that on the VW website, he said yea sure, but those don't do anything, why pay $3000 for them?  Ok. Can we test drive one of the two? Sure! But they wanted to run a credit check beforehand to make sure we can afford it.  "We do this to protect you, because we don't want anyone driving this special car if they can't afford it".  We were taken back a little.  He said "how serious are you, are you looking to make a deal today?".  We said we don't know, it depends how well car drives.  He said, "it drives like a Porsche, have you driven one?  Let us run a credit check on you and you can drive this special car."  Bam!  At this point they have lost a sale and lost any goodwill.   We walked away. No way we're ever going to this dealership again.  What's wrong with them?< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>these guys write the book on sleazy car salesmen. do not waste your time or money here!!

i scheduled an appointment to test drive a car and drove over an hour to get there just to be told the car wouldn't start. very unprofessional.

one of the owners, Abbi, told me he would reduce the price to make up for the inconvenience. however, when i purchased the car he refused to honor that offer. i was tired of car searching and wanted to be done with the whole process so i just paid him the money. BIG MISTAKE.

i left a yelp review after i bought the car describing my experience. the fact that it reflected poorly on Abbi and his team is not my fault. i was honest in my review.

Abbi called me the same day trying to bully me into removing the review. he told me we signed a contract and there were legal implications. there is no such contract. i'm not an idiot, but he might be.

6 days after i bought the car it broke down on the middle of the golden gate bridge.

after just 1,000 miles one of the tires ran flat. when i took it to tire shop they told me all the tires were bald on the inside tread. i explained that i had just bought the car and showed him the inspection report provided to me by Team VW that stated there was plenty of tread left (8/32). he and 2 separate tire shops told me that Team VW had lied on the inspection report and that the tires had to have been bald when i drove it off the lot. the true tread was 2/32 on 2 tires, 1/32 on one, and 0/32 on the one that blew. all three shops told me 1,000 miles could not have worn them to their current state if the details on the inspection report were true.

these guys are complete liars and scam artists. but you don't have to take my word for it. look at their yelp page and see how many other people that have had a horrible experience with them and also attest to their sleazy, shady tactics.

if you think you're getting a good deal it's probably because they're scamming you. you'll pay for it in the long run.< /Text>< username>

<Text>I bought a new car, have had warranty work, body work, regular service and repairs done here. Everyone from the sales department to the service department including management and others have been terrific. A lot has changed and is different here then when I turned a wrench in the late 80s in New Jersey. If you're looking for a new VW; and coming from someone that's fluent in automotive technology, they make a great product; go see Abi or any of the others at Team VW.< /Text><gmapID>0x808f93faa530cf09:0x6defaa6f57fae69a< /gmapID>< name>

Sammi and Jay are always willing to help and put you in the best position to SAVE !  My wife and I came by VW of Hayward in June-2014 . We were in a really bad deal , Sammy and Jay helped us get into a brand new car . 3 yrs later , we have a Tiguan R Line and a Jetta S . Our monthly payments are way less than what we were paying for just one car in 2013.  Sammi and Jay are great people they will get you out the door with a brand new car in 45mins !!  I will be back for a GTI . Thank you VW of Hayward</Review>

<text>I wish I could choose zero star.

I bought a new VW passat sport 2015 on 09/13/2015. Very quickly I observed that the air conditioner does not work very well. Also there is hissing noise that can be heard from the front of the dash.
1) On 10/23/2015, I found that the AC went completely ineffective and I had to sent the car back for service. At first the service department found the low level of refrigerant. They did not look for the root cause of this. Instead, they filled the refrigerant and suggested me to drive the car back. After I refused the suggestion, they then found the leaking of the evaporator. The service department told me that I need to wait until 10/28/2015 because they need to order the evaporator. I asked for a loaned car for my convenience during this period, but they lied to me by saying they are a small dealer and they do not have any loaned car, which I trusted them and later found it a lie (the salesman told me that they do have loaned cars).

2) On 10/28/2015, they called me and told me that the ordered part is broken during delivery and they need to order it again. This time they promised me that the service can be done by 10/29/2015.

3) On 10/29/2015, I heard nothing from the dealer.

4) On 10/30/2015, they called me and told me that they have replaced the evaporator and done road test, meaning everything is good and I can pick up my car. I went to their shop around 7:00pm and picked up the car. I drove for only about 10 minutes and then the engine warning light was on!!! I called them and they told me I can either drove the car back or tow the car to their shop. Why should I do all this when the mistake is obviously on their end? I had to slowly drove the car back to the dealership because they told me they were closing at 9pm. One of their employee in the sales department opened the hood and only found the extremely low level of coolant.!!!  How could they have road test and all the check and not able to find this obvious defect????

At this point, I am very disappointing with VW and Team Volkswagen of Hayward. This is only the obvious problem with the AC. For the hissing sound and others, I really suspect that they have tried to look for the problem. Basically their attitude is like: the car is like this, you have to accept the fact. As a customer without enough knowledge about cars, how could I trust them and how could I know there are no other problems or potential problems???<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>STAY AWAY from this place. If you want to be called names, pushed around and get harassed, then go in and deal with them.

I was physically pushed around by their manager named Jay or Ray. He was calling me names and pushing me out of their lot because i refused to give them my credit app. I will take legal action. Do not even risk coming in here. AVOID AT ALL COST.

They both refused to give me their full names because they knew they are in trouble.

Already in contact with VW corporate and everything has been documented.

Their sales person who I dealt with named Jack was also awful and rude.<//review>< name>

Wonderful dealership, wonderful people to work with and a great transaction. I have been a customer since 2005, and learned my lesson when I bought a car from another dealership in 2008. I returned to buy a passat in February this year with another great experience. Those naysayers out there are simply trying to pull sales away from a good dealership. All I can say is thank you to Abby, Jay and Sami for the impeccable service I continually receive.</Text>

FLEW to Oakland to pick up and they had SOLD my car the night before. I received a call when I was one block away informing me it was actually gone. I had set up an appointment and they promised to hold it for me. I thought the salesmen Javier was lackluster and unprofessional leading up to this, turns out I was right.<//Text>

<text>I had a great experience leasing an e-Golf from VW Hayward. I worked with Soo Sweet and Hamid and couldn't be happier with my purchase.

Upon arriving at the dealership, Soo (pronounced Sue) greeted me and immediately retrieved the e-Golf I was interested in. They offered a test drive and gave me an opportunity to check the car over. I mentioned the lease offer that was advertised on their website and when it came time to "negotiate", I was presented an offer that matched their advertised special. No bait-and-switch, no gimmicks.

I spent some time combing over the numbers and everything matched up. The finance portion was even smoother. I wasn't given any elaborate sales pitch of underbody coatings or anything else. Just direct and to the point. Start to finish was less than 2 hours and we were on our way with our new car.

I returned today (one week later) to pick up a 2nd key that wasn't quite ready during the purchase. Everything was handled very professionally and quickly. They even gave me a free EV-charge before I left.

I got a screaming deal at VW Hayward with no gimmicks. I'm happy with my purchase and hope to buy another car from them when my lease is up! Thanks!</text></record></dataset><record>

Abby, Sami, & Issac did an amazing job helping me with my entire car situation. I have been a customer for the past 3 years and they have never failed me. They are respectful and will work with you no matter your situation. Honestly if you are getting your first car or looking for a new one, come to VW hayward and ask for these 3 gentlemen because they will make the process so smooth.  The whole VW hayward team is AMAZING!! thank you everyone so much for always making my experience one I'll never forget.<//text>

<Review>Sami you the best.

Unfortunately two of the salesmen like "Abby Mujadadi" and one more guy  who sits next to him (forgot his name) love to laugh or mock a customer if you try to negotiate. Both of them are good at uttering rude and insulting remarks.  On the contrary Sami, the General manager is totally opposite. He tries to work with you if you get a chance to talk to him.  He is one of the best dealership manager I have met.  Even if he cannot come with a deal the customer wants, he values his customers.

I was shocked to hear the comments made by Abby Mujadadi and his other over smart colleague (again I don't remember his name) while negotiating.
Specially because me and my wife were their return-customers.

One of the guys in service department also apologized for their words.

I would still like to recommend the vw Hayward to others because of other nice salesmen.

AVOID DEALING WITH "ABBY MUJADADI " AND THE GUY WHO SITS NEXT TO HIM (I didn't even ask his name as I wasn't talking to him but he still couldn't stop himself from commenting ).

I even contacted vw about the incident.  It's sad to see the reputation of good dealerships ruined by bunch of rude salesmen who think they are the only ones selling cars.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808f93faa530cf09:0x6defaa6f57fae69a<//Gmap_id>< resp>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I was looking to trade in my MINI and get a great lease deal on a VW Golf.  After a very unfortunate visit to Dublin VW, my boyfriend took me to see Team VW of Hayward.  My salesperson, David Hernandez, was fantastic from beginning to end. Even though it was the end of the night and he had other customers at the time, especially right at the holiday, he kept us updated with the process and went over the features after the sale. He even offered to swap out my carpeted floor mats for the mud mats after hearing that I was going to take the dogs to Point Isabel the next day.  I was so impressed!  Sami, the equally fantastic GM, got me a price that was so great on a Golf TSI SE that I decided to buy it instead of just lease.  I got the car that I wanted for the price that I wanted from a team that I trust! Thanks, Sami and David!< /Text>< pictures>

<Name>Christopher Krohn</Name><Text>I bought a used 2011 Ford Escape from here this past week. I inquired via email and had Yveth contact me within the hour. I walked on over, did a test drive and loved it. I was pre-approved through a lender and Sami took it upon himself to beat the approval I had gotten. Not only did he knock off $1000 dollars, but got me a monthly payment lower than what I was quoted.. over $50 more. When I went to pick it up the next day, Sami told me he had great new, he was able to lower my interest rate and got a 2yr warranty for my Escape.

This is a great place to buy a vehicle and would do business with them in the future.

Thanks Team Volkswagen!<//Text>< date>

<Date>1479327104444</Date><Text>My husband and I visited them in August of 2014 looking to test drive a Touareg.  They told us it was their policy to not allow test driving because prospective Touareg owners want to purchase that model with the least amount of mileage possible.  After pressing them about this (because why would anyone buy a car without test driving it 1st?) they blurted out that they didn't think we could afford it then tried to convince us to buy a Tiguan instead.  When I called back to speak to the manager (after calling other VW dealerships to inquire about this "policy") the manager admitted that they use their personal judgement as to who they allow to test-drive their vehicles.  Joke's on them, we went to Audi and purchased a fully loaded Q5 instead.   I'd give them zero starts if possible, and a B rating for Bigot.< /Text><response>None<//response>< pics>

Picked up a 2013 TDI Sportwagen. Price beat out the other VW dealers in the area by $1500+. Abby and Nana were great. No pressure on the sale, which is good for me because I hate awkward sales pitches, I always get sweaty. Just as I was about to leave, they told me to bring it back after my holiday road trip to the midwest to have it detailed. What a treat. Thanks guys!<//text>

Great experience!

After going through hayward honda, hayward nissan and fremont chevy, whose attitudes were horrible!, their customer service for all three was distasteful and vary unpleasant, I tried out VW Hayward. Went in Friday 8/1/2014 to see my options, they offered a 14 model passat. Went to work and went back that night to get the car. Absolutely great job Team VW! I recommend anyone whose looking for a great dealership that offers great customer service, willingness to help, the atmosphere was vary welcoming and they were vary knowledgeable I was looking for a new forever car and I think TEAM VW just added me into the VW family.

Highly recommended!

<review>This is for the Service Department.
My husbands 2011 VW GTI started to leak fluid from the coolant. We had a friend look at it and told us that we should take it back the dealer because it is a manufacturing problem with the water pump on older VW cars. My husband made an online appt. they scheduled us 1st thing the next day. I took the car in and was assisted by Robert who was very professional and respectful. He knew exactly what the problem was by me giving him  a brief explanation. He then took a look at it and assured me that it was covered under the warranty and it would be done that day. I left the car there and about 5 hours later they called and had a very nice young man pick me up in a nice clean VW Passat. The car now runs GREAT! Thank you Robert, Roman, and all of the Team VW staff.

PS. One of the Sales men took some time to come talk to me and my son. We were trying to get a soda out of the machine, but it was not working. He came back with a cold soda for my son and then took time to talk to him. Very nice and respectful...

<Text>This is my first time new car buy experience. I am always a cautious person when it comes to big purchase. After three weeks intensive research, I decided to go with 2013 Jetta GLI autobahn. I did shop around by requesting nearly every VW dealership in bay area. Among all the quotes I received, Hayward VW not only provided the best price but more importantly, during email exchange and face to face communication, I found they are really a group of honest and nice guys. I like the way they do business, transparent and very efficient. I spent less than three hours total in my only two visits (including test drive, signing paper work) to their dealership and drove my new GLI home. I personally recommend Abby (internet sale manager), sales consult Nana and Misael. They are the people you want to do business and won't feel pressured.<//Text><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

What a TEAM!

For the past 10 years I have been driving a Volkswagen.  First the Jetta, then the Passat, after that the Touareg and now I just leased a brand new 2013 CC R-Line. The car is amazing, its gas mileage is nearly twice what I was getting and now I have Bluetooth for my phone and navigation for directions to all the places I want to go.

I bought my first VW from Team Volkswagen of Hayward. It was a rainy afternoon and I was nervous to come out and buy a new car from a new dealer. I had recently moved from Maui where I had purchased two vehicles from the Ford dealership there.

I must say that my experience that first time with the VW Team has kept me coming back for 3 more cars so far. One of the many reasons is the way Team Volkswagen treats me, whether I am coming in to see Robert for service, or Hamid regarding a new car, I know that I am going to be taken care of from start to finish with respect, transparency and a win – win end result.

I want to say how much I appreciate the helpfulness Jay and Sammy are in making me find the right selection and the right options for getting into a new car. I felt like they basically tucked me into the new CC and helped me out of the “Dream” car I was in – my Touareg.  I really enjoyed that vehicle, taking it to the snow and the desert and packing my friends in to go out to the city. It wasn’t easy for me to let it go of, but after taking a test-drive in the TDI Beetle, the Hybrid Jetta and then the sleek curved CC R-Line, I knew I needed to make the switch.  I even saved a ton of money.

One the ways they helped was to provide me with a really knowledgeable associate by the name of David. This fellow really knew about the car and walked me through all the various amenities that the CC offered.  I never felt like I was asking to many questions or that I was taking up too much time, I never felt hurried or that I had asked a dumb question. Team Volkswagen gets it. They truly put the "E" in tEam.

The entire dealership is really built around the customer, whether it’s Kukui taking a payment for the 10k service or Fiona answering a question on the phone regarding tire pressure – they are all in it to win it, to win it for me.

I have never been happier to purchase repeatedly from one dealer then I have been with Team Volkswagen of Hayward.

If you are looking for a great experience, then you need to give Team Volkswagen a test drive – I know you won’t be disappointed.

RW - A very happy VW owner and a loyal Team Volkswagen Client.<//Text>

I went to VW of Hayward to test drive a Golf R and was very rudely told that they don't do test drives until you were purchasing the car. Ridiculously poor customer service.<//Text>

Horrible, childish, rude manager. Acted like he was doing me a favour selling me a car at a $10k markup. Asked me if I know English when I was trying to clarify something he mumbled. Never coming back here. Avoid this dealership.< /Text>

The unfriendliest dealership ever. Looks like people there are not about customer service at all.
Don't go there - you'll save yourself lots of headaches and will regret it eventually.</Text>

<date>1578382782087</date><Review>This is the Rubios location that I frequent. The staff is courteous and professional. The food has been consistently fantastic and impressive on nearly every visit. On the rare occasion that the salsa bar is messy, the workers will do their best to clean it back to a spotless shine.

I highly recommend the bowls and fish taco especial. The food is always fresh and the portions are generous. I have had many items on the menu and still think that the California bowl with chicken is the best tasting.

I would highly recommend Rubio's; it's a great substitute for cheap greasy tacos or disappointing salad bowls.< /Review>< Response>

<text>This rubios is the worst! They almost always get my order wrong and they make me drive all the way back to pick up the fixed order and never offer any compensation. If it only happened a few times it wouldn't bother me but it happens almost everytime i pick up food. Also the staff is rarely friendly. I guess i won't be having rubios anytime soon, at least not from here!<//text>< UserId.>

Ordered 15 minutes before close, the fryers were already off and they couldn't make the fish tacos you're known for. Extremely disappointed the my order couldn't be made due to turning off the fryers before the store actually closes.</Review>

The food is fresh and delicious with a variety of great combinations. The best part is the customer service! They're knowledgeable about the menu and accommodate customer preference to customize dishes. Vince is a model employee! Polite, knowledgeable, helpful, and makes the experience pleasant and memorable. We'll definitely be going back again 👍🏻</Review>

Just there at 1. I asked for one salmon taco and a drink. She charged me over $11. Questioned it she gave me change. When I got my taco it was a deep fried greasy taco covered in mayo. Grose.  I starting eating thinking it was salmon. But no. Yuk. Now I'm dealing with a stomach ach. I'm  a Rubios lover from San Diego. Onterio, you need to step up to your usual quality.< /Text>

<review>Friendly service. Good quality of food. Longer wait time for food compared to other Rubio's. I will say maybe as much as double the wait time. Maybe it is because they take more phone orders or the staff is still new. Some dishes are dressed a little plain compared to other Rubio's. Floor was dirty last time I was there. Maybe someone used a dirty mop because the floor was super sticky.< /review>< username>

Food is good. The only problem is that it's a little to pricey for my taste.< /Review>

Just got home with food and there's a long light brown or blonde hair in my food. Few things as gross as pulling a 6 inch hair out if your mouth wrapped around your fish taco. No one in my family has hair this color.< /review>

<review>Food taste great good options on sauce. The employees are very up beat and nice. I had an experience where I went in at 8:50pm and didn't notice they were closing in 10 minutes but they still took my order and game me a kind smile. Good job manager and staff (Maria) was awesome</review><pics>None</pics>< UserId.>

<text>This center does a great job. My case was registration and license plate order for an out of state car. Fran gave good advice on the phone before I head out to her center and I knew exactly what documents are needed and how long it will take me to get it done.

This place is amazing. I read all the reviews, but I was still skeptical. Turns out they're spot on. I came in with out of state plates and an out of state title thinking I'd probably not get this done in one day. Spoke to Francesca and walked out in 10 minutes with new plates/tags and my new title being mailed to me. You know when you're at the DMV for 6 hours and you're like "I'd pay $300 to just be done with this"? This is the place for you. It was expensive yes, but worth every penny to have the process over and done with in minutes. I was the only one there around 5pm and they're open till 7pm. As the other reviews mention, it's cash-only so bring a good amount with you. Francesca was super cool and helpful with the process and I couldn't recommend her and this business more. Thank you!< /review>

Fran and her team at LaCasita exceeded my expectations. I was dealing with what the DMV said was a difficult and unusual situation. Fran was extremely knowledgeable about title transfers from out of state as well as transfers of title upon death and all applicable California registration details.

The small fee that I paid was well worth the price. I spent hours at the DMV. Fran handled my case in minutes. Dispute her clear direction with what I needed, I showed up lacking some documentation as well as forms incorrectly filled out. Fran was patient and calmly helped me revise the paperwork and stayed late to allow me to retrieve what I left at home.

I will always return to support this local business. The owners treat you like family and make everything easier in a fraction of the time a DMV visit takes.< /review>< Pics>

Very helpful and amazing service. It’s way faster and a million times more helpful than the normal DMV. I completed a title transfer and got my car registered here within minutes. I had an excellent experience here and I highly recommend going here for any of the DMV services they offer. Just make sure you don’t forget to bring cash (they have an ATM w/ a $400 withdrawal limit and banks are very close by). Thank you again for being so polite and helpful!<//Text>

I went here because I never received my registration stickers in the mail. Tried going to the DMV for the replacement and the system went down. I was in and out of La Casita in no time. There was no line, no wait, no issues. Bring cash for your transactions. It is worth the convenience fee.< /text>

<Text>My wife and I went here for help with both of our out of state vehicles. Fran was knowledgeable, patient and kind. She had tags on my wife’s car within minutes. Instead of taking my money for my truck, she advised me to head to the dmv because I had fees to pay from the person I got my truck from. She could have handled it easily. But because she was a compassionate and sympathetic person, she chose to  lose money so I wouldn’t have to. That’s pretty rare these days. I will always go to la casita and will advise everyone I know to do the same.<//Text>< Pics>

< review>
Just moved to California from the east coast and knew nothing about the registration process here. After going back and forth with the DMV, trying to register my financed jersey car, I literally almost gave up and figured I was cursed with jersey plates for the rest of my life. After getting smogged I googled my options for a vin check and La Casita popped up with a five star rating and I noticed that they handled everything I needed. I called up there and it legit was the best thing I ever did. Fran was so reassuring and calm and collected and told me to head out there. Basically, my car had tags in about five minutes flat. No bs, no waiting, no rudness that you get from dmv. It was a breeze for Fran and I swear I will never go anywhere else for my dmv needs literally ever again. Kindness like hers is a rarity that is sometimes underrated or overlooked—- it meant the world to me and I’m so thankful to have found La Casita. 🙏🏼🖤< /review>

Great service.
We sold a truck to a customer in California and as a dealer in Florida, we did not know exactly how is the procedure in CA.
Before I found La Casita I had two other Title and registration companies supporting me but with less knowledge about what is requested for out of state vehicles and trucks.
I spoke to Francisca who gave us the best support possible and she made things so quick and clear.
I will definitely use their services again.<//review>

<review>My wife and I moved to CA from VA and had to register our vehicle in CA. I had called the DMV who told me to do it online, but then denied it and said I had to come in but that I couldn’t make an appointment. So I googled DMV locations and this place popped up, and going here was the best decision I’ve ever made. Fran was super friendly and knowledgeable, she walked us through the process and in 20 min I was done. The prices are completely reasonable when you realize how much time she saves you from having to waste at a DMV, and time is far more valuable. Go here! Don’t bother with the DMV, you will not regret it.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I needed to register my truck after having it smogged. I have used other services like this one in the past so I was familiar with basically how they work. I was extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service and what I consider dishonest “gouging” by La Casita!

When I walked up to the counter and presented my smog certificate and the proof of insurance she asked me what else I had received from DMV. I told her that was all I had and she said she was “just trying to save me money”. I said “ok. What else do you need?” And she said “the registration”. I told her I thought she could just look that up on the computer.

She then proceeded to tell me I was suspended for failing to provide proof of insurance. She said it would cost $75 to remove the suspension. I told her that I was surprised by that because the truck has always been insured.

She then tried to hand everything back to me and I told her that needed to get this done today and I asked why she was handing the paperwork back to me? I told her I was willing to pay the $75 even though I wished I didn’t have to. I handed her my debit card and she said “ cash only” and pointed to an atm in the corner of the room allowing $400 withdrawals. I must admit that I was perturbed that a business wouldn’t accept my atm card but I paid the fee and withdrew $400.

I gave her $80 and she gave me back $5 with no receipt. She then made a phone call to DMV and was put on hold until someone finally came on and she convinced them to release the suspension. She then said that I hadn’t paid the registration and that it was $397.

This upset me because I did not have enough cash after paying her the $75. I asked her if that fee went to DMV and she said no. She said that was their fee!

I left to go to my bank to get additional funds to pay the $397 registration fee.

I returned and gave her $400. She gave me $3 back and my sticker and receipt from DMV. I turned to leave but noticed that it said I paid $357.00 for registering the vehicle.

I went back to her and asked for a receipt for all the cash I had paid. I confronted her about why she mislead me into thinking my registration fee was $397 instead of the actual $357. She said that was including their $40 fee. But I told her it was dishonest to tell me my registration fee was $397 when it was $357! I asked her if most people don’t catch that. She said “they all catch it”. So I asked why she wasn’t just honest about it?

She gave me a receipt but I noticed that the $75 fee said “Vin retrieval”. I pointed it out to her and she apologized saying she made a mistake. The final receipt said “suspension fee”. As she was handing me the new receipt she again tried to say that they had to make money so they charge fees. When I explained that I understood that but I was concerned that she tried to make me think DMV was charging $397 when it was actually $357 and she drowned me out with continually repeating “thank you have a nice day” over and over again until I had left. She refused to let me speak! She was so rude and obviously did not care about being honest or providing good customer service. I will never go back there and I hope others think twice before utilizing the services of this business. Very shady indeed!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>What a fantastic alternative to the DMV! The people at La Casita are very polite, willing to go the extra mile to help you through whatever situation you're in, and work with you to find solutions. The location is right in the heart of Encinitas along El Camino Real so access is easy from all parts of North County. Definitely check out their website to understand what they are licensed to process, and select them over the DMV for anything they are able to do (which is a lot!).< /Review></record>

I was absolutely dreading driving to a main office and wait in an endless line. No one has that kinda time! Our registration was lost in the mail and significantly past due. I drove to the office at my lunch break, there was no line and they were able to help me immediately. I went to 711 to withdraw cash (it is a US Bank ATM) and was out of the office in less than 5 minutes.  Best DMV experience I've ever had :)</review>< time>

Husband and I went here to get our registration renewed...this place was awesome! Wish I knew about this place sooner! We were in&out in less than 20 mins! I recommend going to this place rather than DMV itself! There is a small fee and they only take cash...which isn’t a problem because there’s an ATM machine in the 7 Eleven next to it and I rather pay this fee to avoid 2 hours at DMV! This a legit DMV processing center.< /review>

Fran was amazingly helpful, I went to triple A and they couldn’t help and advise me to go to the DMV so I went to another 3rd party dmv place in Carlsbad and the girl there had no clue what she was talking about and told me she couldn’t help. I have bought and sold many vehicle so I knew it was possible and wasn’t going to waste time at the dmv so I found La Casita in Encinitas and met with Fran, explained my situation and she was able to instantly help me! I bought a used vehicle out of state from a dealership and AAA won’t touch dealer sold cars and the other place told me I needed three bills of sale which made no sense at all. I highly recommend going to La Casita’s for all your dmv needs! They also have a really cool little market attached so you can get snacks for the kids while your waiting for 5-15 min. Avoid the dmv and let Fran make your life simple and easy! Thank you Fran!

I went in to get my car registered for the first time in CA. The lady was very efficient and helpful, and was very knowledgable. It did cost a lot more than going to the DMV - $99 for the out of state to CA registration, and then $245 for the paperwork. But there was no line, and I had my new plates and registration within 15 mins. So the extra cost was worth it.<//Review>

Kinda shady at first glance but the workers know what they're doing. I was helped the moment I walked in by people who are very familiar with the out of state registration process and left with California plates. Very professional, friendly and helpful. Recommend for everyone.</Review>

Fantastic experience! Every question I had was answered and I was finished with the process in under 5 minutes.  I was looking down the barrel of a two month wait for a reservation/appointment at the  San Marcos DMV.  Here, I walked in and walked out with my new registration and transfer of an in state vehicle.  This is now where I  will come for all of my DMV needs.</Text>

A couple of thing to note as you go in: it is cash only and there is a small fee to run these services. Totally worth the fee and cash only. If you are all about convenience like me, you pay a little bit extra to not sit in line for hours at the actual dmv.

You can confirm our authenticity on the CA DMV website by simply entering our location zip code (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/bp_locator/reg_svc).  Or you can simply go to our web page under the section "about us" and to find a copy of our official license for registration services provided by the DMV.\nOur prices are in line with the service fees as other competitive 3rd party DMV registration agents. We inform of all service fees prior to processing transactions and also post our fees and location on our business website under the service/fees section (https://www.lacasitadmv.com/services-fees). As a service center we do charge these service fees in addition to what is owed to the DMV. Other service centers, similar to ours, also charge service fees in addition to what is owed to the DMV.\nOur patrons have informed us that payment of our reasonable service fees outweigh the task of spending most of the day in line at the DMV. In addition, to minimize additional fees to our customers we have decided to do a cash only business.'}</resp>

Honest Review!
Going to the dentist makes me anxious but Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra really alleviated a lot of my anxiety. For one, the staff are super nice and courteous. They make sure to check in on you and make you as comfortable as possible. Secondly, the Doctors here are amazing! I believe my doctor was Dr. Martinez. He answered all my questions and even made me laugh during my root canal procedure. That truly helped me calm down. The dental assistants and hygienist are super helpful as well. Third, the front staff and Frances were super nice.  Frances answered all questions pertaining to my insurance. I truly appreciate the customer service! If you are looking for a place that really cares about you, answers questions, works with you financially, and truly want your teeth to be healthy, then this is the place for you! I will be back!!!</review>

I've been going to Dr. Dara and her team for four years now, and every single time I've been treated with care and respect. I used to hate going to the dentist, but every single person here is so wonderful and welcoming. The procedures are relatively painless and they take care to make sure you're comfortable. And when they recommend you floss more, it doesn't feel like you're being scolded - it genuinely feels like they're giving you (really good/healthy) advice and they want what's best for you.
If you dread going to the dentist, don't. They are wonderful here.</Text>

Really glad a found a dental office that is welcoming, and very professional. Always puts the clients needs first and their minds at ease. I've always hated visiting the dentist, but after finding this office I've lost my fear. Dr. Martinez is truly an asset. I now take my daughter, my mom, and myself to this dental office. 100% recommend them.</Review>

Amazing!! I Highly recommend this office!!!!!!
About a week ago I had an incident that required immediate dental work, due to COVID-19 I was unable to get  hold of anyone in my regular dental office. I was referred to Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra and without any hesitation they were able to take me in. Francis is AMAZING, she walked me through the whole process, and made me feel as if I was an old patient. Dr. Dara was beyond helpful and thoroughly explained more than imagined. Once you find this GEM, you will no longer want to seek another dental office.< /Text>

As usual, my dental visit was excellent! The staff was courteous and very professional.  My dental hygienist is gentle and thorough.  My dentist takes time to ask me questions and gives me an honest update on the future care of my teeth. I definitely would give them a 5 star rating.< /text>

The front desk staff are polite, professional, and treat you like family. Dr. Dara and her dentistry team are excellent in what they do.

Best Dental Office Ever!
From start to finish you will receive amazing customer service. Yessica and Francis are amazing, they man the front and greet you by name when you walk in.  The doctors themselves are extremely professional and take the time to give you the best service possible. Dr. Martinez does amazing work, he is super gentle and really takes his time. Constantly checks in while he’s working to make sure you aren’t in any pain instead of you suffering through it all. The hygienists are very good, my teeth feel like a million bucks after they clean my teeth! Lastly, you’ll be well taken care of at this office, they never disappoint me.</Review>

The team here is very nice and honest. A few years ago, I was told I needed to spend a few thousand dollars to have a root canal done. The honest doctors here instead, wanted to preserve my tooth and tried alternative ways to be less invasive. I feel like they care for my oral health and are not trying to make an extra buck off of me. A MAJOR PLUS is when they slowly numbed me so that the process was minimally painful. They are great!!!< /review>

<review>For me, I work late hours during the weekdays so I am unable to make it during their normal business hours, but they help schedule me to come in on Saturday mornings which I prefer and that to me means a lot because they work with you to try and fit your schedule.

I’ve been coming to this dental office for the past 2 years and I can honestly say that the entire staff are amazing. From the moment you walk into their new office location in Alhambra, you immediately feel welcomed and they make sure to provide you with the best service possible. The doctors do amazing work and they really take the time to explain the procedure with you and to make sure you don’t feel any pain or discomfort. They are always there to answer any of your questions and make you feel at ease. All in all, you will leave the office with a good experience.

If you are in the area and are in need of some dental work done or maybe looking for a new dentist, I highly recommend this Dental office to everyone as they really care about their customers and provide amazing customer service.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1576800866395, 'text': 'David, thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to write this review.

I don't usually like dentists and hadn't been in a while when I first went to Dr Dara's office a few years ago.  The staff is always friendly and made me feel at ease!  They have helped me slowly get back on track and take care of the things I was neglecting due to not having good experiences at the dentist in the past.  I really kind of enjoy going to the dentist now :) thanks to Francis and Dr Dara and everyone else for all there help! I definitely recommend it!< /Review>

I've had a few visits now at Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra, the level of care has been the best I've had in years! The staff are all lovely, positive people that make for a warm atmosphere in the office. The office is also very modern and well equipped compared to what I've experienced elsewhere.

Dr Martinez has been great, he takes the time to explain the procedures and why he recommends them, which put me at ease understanding things beyond the obvious 'you have a cavity.'  He was also very attentive while working on my teeth, it was a fairly painless experience all things considered for the work I needed.

I would definitely recommend Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra!<//Text>

<text>Being afraid of needles and constantly dealing with dry mouth, I was worried about going back to the dentist after a long time. I needed A LOT of work done and not only did they work with me financially with each appointment and procedure, they provided excellent and timely service. Dr. Martinez takes an extremely gentle and educational approach to dentistry. I couldn't be more happy with my experience at advanced dentistry Alhambra! Thank you × 1,000,000 !<//text></record>

Dr Dara and her team are amazing!! I was looking for a new dentist after moving back to LA. I had some some previous periodontal issues and they got me on a cleaning plan that was tailored for that. I also had some cosmetic issues and decided to get my first crowns with them. From the financial planning, prep, to the design of the crowns, Dr. Dara and her team were very accommodating and I felt very much cared for during the whole process. Dr Dara took time to make sure my crowns were customized to match and fit and they did!!< /review>

<Time>1533141128397< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I don't like dentists, but I do like Dr. Dara and her staff.  Recently I had gone in due to major tooth pain.  The day before the 4th of July I could not even lie down due to my pain.  At 6:00  that evening, I called the office to leave a message, and just thought I was going to go for 2 days with major pain.  I was surprised to find Frances in the office, answering my call, and letting me know that Tuesday is their late day, and to by there by 7:00.  I was just about in tears due to the pain.  I got to the office, they took me right in, and they stayed with me, working on me for over 2 hours.  Dr. Dara was so wonderful, I kept apologizing for making them stay late the day before the holiday, but she kept saying, we are here for our patients.  I can not thank them enough.  Also wanted to mention a thanks to Dr. Martinez and Dr. Dang, also extremely good.</review>< pictures>

<date>1550425774468<//date><rating>1< /rating><text>I fell victim to the Deep Cleaning scam here also, I go to the dentist religiously and take care of my teeth. I just started going here because I moved far from my old dentist. It shocked me when they did my gum measurements, which was painful because it was pushed so deep to record astronomically high measurements. Never had I was nearly double my last measurements. They said I needed a deep clean, I was so shocked. I went ahead with it, then Francis said I needed to pay 50% of the cleaning which, I was not comfortable with. What kind of office takes money before the procedure when they are supposedly certain the patient would need the procedure. I was only comfortable paying half of it. So I paid half and my insurance and got the deep clean done. It was excruciatingly painful way more painful then I remember getting it done a decade ago. Anyways, my insurance covered it, because I've had a deep clean a decade ago.

Then I went on to read these reviews and it all makes sense now, they push the deep clean to everyone and roll the dice to see if the insurance would pay for it. This is why they collect money up front so you lock into doing the procedure. They rush you into doing the deep clean within the week so they don't have to file the preauthorization with the insurance company, because I called my insurance the day after the office said I needed a deep clean, all the office has to do is file a predetermination claim with the insurance. How does a dental office, not know this? they just want your money. I may or may not have needed a deep clean, but from the way they handle business and how I'm reading they treat other people the same way, I will not be going back here. If they suggest the deep clean, get a 2nd opinion, Shady business.<//text>< Pics>

<text>I really do not like going to the dentist, but if I find one I like I will stick with them.  I recently started going here based on a referral from someone at work.  I travel 20 miles one-way now (in LA traffic) to go. I will gladly make this trek based on their work.<//text>< pics>

<review>I am TERRIFIED of the dentist. What I love about the staff here is that they always make me feel at ease. I have never experienced any discomfort. They listened to me about my phobia and always take the time, as we go through procedures, to ask about how I am feeling, level of anxiety/ discomfort, etc. I never feel rushed...I always feel like I am their most important patient.
I met and was treated by Dr. Martinez for the first time. Of course I was a bit apprehensive but in little to no time, I felt like I did with my other doctors there.
I also appreciate how Frances (front office) come back to explain the monetary/insurance part and offer alternatives.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>I am very pleased with the treatment I received from Dr. Dara - I had a few cleanings done as well as some fillings. The Dr. is professional and kind as is her staff. The price is very reasonable and they were willing to work with my budget. I would recommend Dr. Dara to anyone looking for a dentist.<//review>< pics>

I must say I'm very pleased with my dentist Dara Gashparova she is very professional and funny, she explain what she is going to do and always asking are you ok. I feel she takes her job very serious she explains to her helper what she is doing and why I feel she is a great teacher also. So if you are looking for a dentist that is compassionate and caring this is the one. She has moved to this new place on 70 S Palm Ave. Alhambra it seems to be top of the line beautiful and clean. Oh don't forget the great staff she has.

Thanks,
Mrs Taylor

I have been attending the Dental office, of Dr Dara Gashparova for about  5 years. The staff are always polite, and have good customer service skills. They are flexible when I can't make it to an appointment, and will help me reschedule. I have never waited for a long period of time during an appointment.The Dental Hygienist Wylene Jiung is courteous, and has pleasant manners. I always walk out of the Dental office content with the superb job Jiung does. Dr. Martinez has done some dental work on my teeth, and I am please with his work. He listens to any dental concerns I am having by making suggestions. Dr. Martinez always does a satisfactory job in explaining any procedure before he starts.Dr. Martinez, is a professional in his practice, amiable, and has polite bedside manners.< /review>

< Review>
Been training here for the past 6 months, I honestly can say I am in the best shape of my life thanks to my trainer/ coach Luis , I have lost 42 lbs and can lift more weight than ever before. My mile time went from 9 minutes to just below 7 min mile. It is a great open space with tons of free weights. I highly recommend you give them a try. Awesome community of people everyone is welcoming and supportive. It really is the best part of my day. They also have a nice outdoor workout area too.<//Review>

As I looked into my recent photos, I can see that I am getting fatter. So, I decided to go to this gym near our house. And I acquired a great service because they really assisted me in what to do for me to lose weight. In just a week I lose 2kls and it made me feel eager to lose more!</Text>

<Text>Parked by this place the other day while picking up from the neighboring restaurant and there was a crowd of about 20 people running laps in the street without masks on? This is also during a peak surge of COVID-19 in Los Angeles hospitals. Seems to be a complete disregard for the safety or respect of the surrounding area where there are numerous businesses and dog parks that remain open.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Me and my girlfriend loved the gym. It’s big, has all the equipments (brand new), also has air runners, skis, air bikes and rowers. Very clean and well decorated. It has many and also flexible open gym hours, which was all we needed for our training program. The coaches were very gentle, receptive and helpfull. The owner is an awesome guy that made us feel like home and it was really a pleasure meeting him! If you’re looking for a gym that is fully equipped (with good equipment), good coaches, open gym hours, this is your place.< /Text>

Been training here for about 6 months . Excellent environment for training . Never made so many friends at a gym. Solid coaching and programming never been so strong just wanted to give them a shout out for all the support they have given me. If your into it Olympic weightlifting or CrossFit  this the best spot in downtown.<//review>

Very very rude staff. Extremely poor communication. I dropped in to see what the environment is like. They said I could just work out. Then FORCED me to pay $20 by shouting at me in front of everyone in the gym, when I simply said I didn’t know the price list.<//Text>

Plus, Trojan’s space is huge. Because of the size of the gym, you’ll never have to worry about being jammed together with other members as you work out — there’s plenty of breathing room.

Overall, I can’t recommend Trojan Athletics enough. It’s been my home gym for 7 months and I have no plans to switch gyms anytime soon.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKzm-6wCue0zrz4tvxO3Vfiw7lpQlvpMi0VQDy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

I cannot speak highly enough of Trojan Athletics. I have been working out here for almost a year and can attest to its strengths: knowledgeable coaches, clean facility, and great community.

Coaching — The coaches at Trojan are incredibly attentive and extremely knowledgeable about CrossFit and weightlifting. I came to Trojan as a complete beginner; I had never used a barbell or done any kind of Metcon training. What I noticed immediately is that ALL the coaches took the time to train me properly and ensure that I was completing movements correctly. Crossfit sometimes gets a bad name due to athlete injuries, but the coaches at Trojan truly invest in helping beginner athletes form correct habits and advanced athletes modify their technique.

Classes — Classes are offered throughout the day and up until 8 pm, which was a huge bonus for people (like myself) who work late. The classes are TOUGH and will push an athlete both mentally and physically to achieve his or her fitness goals. After a short time training here, I began to notice changes in my strength, body composition, and muscle mass.

Community — The people who train at Trojan are a close knit community. The athletes here are a diverse group of ALL skill levels and are extremely welcoming. During the CrossFit open, the sense of camaraderie was exceptional. We all stayed to watch our friends in hourly heats. Memorial Day and Regionals offer other opportunities to compete and have fun.

I highly recommend Trojan Athletics to athletes of any skill level or desired fitness goals.< /Text>

I have been dropping into Trojan Athletics for awhile now and every time I workout I have an awesome time. The coaching staff is helpful and the community is nice. The programming they provide is killer. They give you tips and tricks while perform the workout or after. They don't have a lazy staff. The space is big and the equipment is well maintained. They know what they are doing. You will not be disappointed joining the community or dropping in.

Whether you are just starting Crossfit or have been doing it for several years, you will find Trojan such a fun environment with an awesome community of people that will push you to get better and stronger. The gym is a huge space that is extremely clean and well laid out, with room for large and fun classes. Darren, Dave, Anna and Rich are extremely knowledgeable and will encourage and push you to become a better athlete. They always make classes fun and ensure you are practicing proper form.

This box is pretty great. They go through the movements and have plenty of modifications to make sure you don't get hurt or frustrated about the movements in the workout. They are more of a traditional box, but not in the sense that they require you to vomit and go into rhabdo to be a part of the box.

All that can be said probably for a lot of boxes (thankfully), but what sets Trojan apart is Darren. I was a visiting student for a month and pretty strapped on cash. Darren was very understanding and incredibly flexible with making sure I met my fitness goals while going through this incredibly expensive time in my education.

Thank you Darren and Trojan Athletics! Please check them out on your way through LA.<//Review>

I love training at Trojan Athletics! Not only the classes are very well planned out, but also the sense of community that you feel while working out with like-minded people, is priceless. In a short amount of time at Trojan, I've been able learn more about Crossfit and its lingo, get stronger, and build some great friendships as an added bonus. If you're in the Downtown LA area and Art District vicinities, this is the box for you! PS: They have the best protein smoothies at the Tonic Bar, conveniently located on site!< /text>

<user_id>115775072153142042165< /user_id><review>Nice people workout here. Weightlifting and crossfit equipments are plenty and facility conditions are ok. But read your contracts carefully and treat every transaction like a serious business dealing regardless of how much time you spent here. Being meek, agreeable, or expecting personalized services can (repeatedly) incur financial consequences.

Edit after reply: I do not mean to object to any contracts I signed up. Other gyms employ such policies. However, as an old member staying for years through a few ups and downs of this place, I do feel entitled to a bit more friendly reminders on changes of terms when they applies to me (i.e. I do not recall any mention of the cancellation policies except buried inside the contract, which of course I should've read, when I asked to change my plans). Similar misunderstandings had happened before, and those times I backed down (as is this time except this feedback) because the specific situations were reasonable from the gym's perspective. However, such occurrences without much leeway do not make me feel like a valued member of the community.

(besides, shouldn't the proper *business* response to a request of cancellation at a date specifically showing my ignorance of the policy be "That cannot be done because your contract would not allow it. Earliest possible date is ..." instead of "Confirmed!" ?)</review><date>1580142832640< /date>< Rating>

<text>I found my new home two years ago at Trojan Athletics. As an Olympic Weightlifter, they offered me the coaching and atmosphere I was looking for. The coaches are extremely knowledgeable and attentive. They go above and beyond for their athletes.

Not just is the coaching terrific, but the people who make up the community are wonderful. I’ve made so many friends through the gym over the years, and the owner and coaches definitely do their part to make sure members have the opportunity to get to know each other through events, cookouts, and trips to the beer garden across the street.

If you’re looking for a great place to train with even better people, Trojan Athletics is your place.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>I come here every day and can honestly say this is the best Crossfit gym ever. The programs are challenging and cater to every fitness level and intensity. The facility is excellent: clean, well-maintained, with a variety of equipment. The community here is fantastic, and the coaches are attentive and knowledgeable.

Just wanted show some support and appreciation for everyone that has coached me and pushed me to get fit lost over 30lbs of fat and gained 20lbs of muscle. Went from a 38”inch waist to a 31”  can’t say enough of how happy I am.< /review>< pictures>

I was in LA for two weeks earlier this month and dropped in at Trojan Crossfit several times during my trip. I would highly recommend to anyone in the area (drop in or local). The coaches are attentive and helpful, the space is great (especially given the location), and they were very accommodating of my recurring drop in situation. Thanks for having me!</review>

Just go to another place. Crossfit spots are a dime a dozen and this place is run by scumbags.

In fairness, this is a nice facility and good people go there but they engage in horrible and corrupt business practices. Be warned and do not pre-pay for anything. Darren Shephard is a lowlife crook. As background:

- I was injured and unable to continue doing any type of physical activity. I had to have surgery. They saw my problem and were well aware of the issues.

-  I asked to have the private classes transferred to my wife so she could try it out. They said no.

- I asked for a refund since I could never use the classes again and they refused to have them transferred. They said no.

- I asked to see a copy of the contract covering the purchase of classes and they said no. Seriously? Who does that? Guess who? Criminals.

- All of this is in writing.

Its shocking to see such behavior. It is illegal. Do yourself and your friends a favor and just go somewhere else or pay money on the barrel for every class. Seriously, Darren Shepard is a lowlife crook who feels its ok to steal.<//review>

This place is one of the best of the best box gyms in LA. The coaches are supportive and encouraging with helping you in perfecting your technique and form.  Ever since the new owner took over, he's created a community in the gym and made the place a welcoming environment. Another plus is they have their own PARKING - in DTLA, that's a gold mine! :)</text>

Which may not sound like much to a normal person, but for an ex-alcoholic who never worked out in a day in his life, is HUGE! Before I joined Trojan, I was on a 3/4 bottle a day whiskey habit for years. Then I joined and it changed my life. Being drunk everyday lost its appeal. Feeling healthy and seeing muscle definition makes it all worth it.

The vegan Bún Húê is very tasty.  So are everything else they cook in this tiny kitchen.  Eaten here for years until COVID hit last year.  Now they are open and cooking delicious Viêt vegetarian foodz.

I get the foodz to go and re-cook them at home.  I add more stuffs I like to the already tasty soup.

Ignore all the negative comments.  They are from cried babies Millennials who somehow didn't get their ways.  The foodz is excellent.<//text>< userid>

This place is a hit or miss. The foods are precooked and sit out, whether they are kept at an safe temperature is uncertain. Sometimes the food smells fine. Sometimes the food smells like it’s been sitting out too long. Lunch plates get reheated in the microwave unless you’re ordering some kind of soup or fried item. The reheating and cooling down could be the reason for the smell if you’re not eating it right away. Or ask that it not be heated up if you plan to take it somewhere when you can reheat it when you’re ready. The options available for lunch combos varies. Overall, it’s still pretty good. It doesn’t blow your mind, just decent.<//Text>

Awesome value for delicious vegan food. Went for the chow mein lunch combination with friends and everyone was very pleased with the food. There's a ton I'm excited to go back and try next time I'm in the area. Great customer service.< /text>

Fantastic vegan Vietnamese food at a place that is a bit run down, but you won’t be disappointed by the flavors and textures. I had the fried rice with 2 main dish choices for $9 and an even $10 with a Soda. Cash only.

Staff are friendly and its fun to listen to them speaking Vietnamese amongst themselves and with some local regulars.

The owner said he opened this shop more than 35 years ago after coming from Vietnam. The vegan ‘meats’ were originally made using bananas, but they now use soy base or jackfruit.

The vegan kebabs and chicken were really tasty and filling. I’d been frustrated by the lack of vegetarian options when I visited Vietnam in the 90’s, but the owners assured me I would find a lot of great options now. Such friendly people.

For sustainability, eat-in diners on reusable plates and utensils but to-go in plastic packaging in plastic bags it seems (so bring your own to save in take-out waste if you can).<//Text>

Everything is vegan and you won’t believe it because the “meat” both looks and tastes like real meat. You really can’t go wrong with anything in there. The combo plate food in the little window is excellent, the egg rolls are to die for. My boyfriend and I have been coming here consistently for three years and we always order a soup (bamboo soup and vegetarian pho is awesome!) and I always get the vegan banh mi (#11 sesame “chicken”)! We don’t live in California anymore, but every time we come to San Jose to visit family we be sure to come here.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fccbe4eeb9e49:0x37835f7d918af290<//gmapID></record>

My new go to for Vietnamese Vegan eats.  It's cash only and holds a few tables inside and outside.  I had the bamboo soup for $9.50 and it was packed with flavor. Hard to believe it's all animal free!</Review>

Do yourself a favor and eat here! I just discovered this place and I’m hooked. Seriously. The spicy pho is sooo good & you won’t need to add any seasoning or sauce, it’s perfect the way they make it. Also, the owners are very friendly and pleasant. Just make sure you have cash as they don’t take card.</Review>

Don’t let the square footage of this restaurant chases you away... it’s located on Santa Clara near S 9th street. With one strip of 4 tables along the wall and few more outside, so come little bit early before noon if you want to eat in...most dishes are priced at $8.50 for eat in or take home. I would recommend spicy noodles soup. Bring cash!<//text>

<review>Certainty a FoodAdventure. Stumbled upon this place while briefly in town. A compete, 100% #vegan Vietnamese Pho hole-in-the-wall eatery. No seafood, no bone broth. All plants. No hipsters. This place is run by Vietnamese and is therefore entirely ethnic with no trace of pretentiousness. Staff is super nice and were helpful to us with a certain personal issue (left something at their cafe). Only the tiniest little remark- the imitation meats could be of slightly higher quality, and perhaps more emphasis on tempeh/tofu as meat replacements would work better in making the meals just that bit More Healthy<//review>< user_name>

<review>Everything on the menu is vegan and reasonably priced (~$10 for a meal), and their imitation meat is delicious! Best vegan/vegetarian pho I've ever had. The broth is flavorful unlike many other restaurants' veggie pho which are bland and unsatisfying. I also enjoy their large variety of deli items - highly recommend the kung pao "chicken"</review>< Pictures>

vietnamese food and service here is quality. Came here on a Saturday. I've had nothing but enjoyable experiences here and plan to keep visiting. The bill was decent for the quality. Feeling here is similar to a place in Columbus I liked.< /Text>

<review>what to order: Bun Bo Hue chay
tip: metered street parking, ca$h only

I love eating Vietnamese vegetarian food because we do it so darn well  and Tofoo Com Chay definitely did not disappoint!

I wish I could have taken some to-go but I didn't bring enough cash.

The Bun Bo Hue was a good size for lunch, flavorful and full of veggies. It wasn't the best Bun Bo Hue Chay I've had but it was good and hit the spot.

While I was eating, a lot of customers came in to order their various dishes. They have several combo options- similar to when you go to a Chinese styrofoam box type place.

Would definitely come back to support the mom&pop restaurant!</review><gmap_id>0x808fccbe4eeb9e49:0x37835f7d918af290<//gmap_id><name>Thuy-Vy Nordan<//name><time>1575630628915< /time>< Pics>

<review>First off, it's great to know that this small whole in the wall is trying to do veggie/vegan vietnamese.

It came recommend from a friend and unfortunately it did not meet the hype and expectations.

I was disappointed to experience difficulty navigating and understanding their menu. While the food is "cheap" it lacked in flavor and freshness.

I visited around the lunch hour and it was evident that the food had been sitting around from the AM. I chose to try their Sesame Veggie Chicken Sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised when a fresh roll of bread was placed in the oven to crisp up. That's where the glam of the sandwich ended. Next the "meat" was pre-made and microwaved to serve. The "meat" lacked flavor and quickly became cold.

Additionally, I ordered their Summer Rolls. I was happy that a range of "meats" where inside the rolls. The sauce that accompanied the rolls was the one thing that saved both my rolls and sandwich.

I do not plan to return. I think the idea is great and as a vegetarian, I am always looking for new and creative ways to enjoy food. Tofoo; however, did not live up to its hype and at best, I didn't even "get what I paid for."<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>I ate here for the second time. The first time the food was alright but this time it was a terrible experience. After ordering our food my friend and I sat outside and this server guy came outside and kept telling us they're closing however it was 30 minutes before their closing time and we saw people still eating outside and inside and new folks still going in but he made it a point to only tell us that he's closing not to anyone else. On top of that it got really uncomfortable when he got in between our personal conversation repeating what I said to my friend. My friend was taken aback, she even remarked maybe he doesn't like brown people. What a terrible experience to give to your customers.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Seriously THE MOST delicious vegan food I’ve ever had! Everything was so flavourful! I will be back whenever I can.  And can I also say the owners are beyond sweet! They have owned and operated this place for over 20 years and truly cook from the heart. It’s a small hole in the wall, but feels like you are eating straight from their home kitchen. Absolutely delicious! Love love love!< /Text><Time>1532061406966< /Time><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The food is beyond excellent! The only reason I'm not giving this place a full 5 stars is because the location is so bad. Also, I once decided to take my food to go, but it just wasn't the same quality as eating in, which was a shame since I would love to eat this more often, but it's just too much of a hassle. Other than that, I highly recommend this place at least once since the food is amazing, and there are few vegan places that can compare.</text>

Tofoo has a lot more flavor than other restaurants with vegetarian soup options. Usually you want the meat to flavor the broth but they do a good job making the broth taste good without it. The tofu or fake meat options don't taste like real meat but they taste like they could plausibly be some sort of animal that you just haven't tasted before.<//review>

My go-to place for inexpensive Vietnamese vegan eats. This hole-in-the-wall is a gem and popular with SJSU students and many locals. I live in SF and drive down to San Jose just for the Mì Quảng noodles, which I can't find vegan and delicious anywhere else. (I used to go to Mint & Basil for those, but they've really gone downhill.)  Sometimes I take an extra order to go for the next day (hint: ask them not to boil the noodles or they get soggy when you reheat them).< /text>

Easily done of the best vegetarian food around! It's a bit of a narrow space but the make the most of it. Amazing dishes and amazing pho. Super nice people also.

It's cash only but well worth a trip to the ATM!< /Text>

Came in after placing a mobile order for a 'Rustic Tomato and Burrata Salad.' I've been a major fan of Sweetgreen featuring burrata cheese in their seasonal menu items. This particular salad that I ordered was exclusively online on the app for this location. I added blackened chicken thigh and swapped out the dressing for a pesto vinaigrette.<//Review>

<Text>Wow. What a small place with great food for a cheep price. Tried it once, and would definitely go again. All vegan, cash only. Recommend even if you are not a vegan or vegetarian, as the taste worth it.

<Text>Best place for vegan food. Try the pho and the noodle salad. I swear, the "meat" tastes like real meat. I don't tell my meat eating friends that they're eating vegan until they are finished eating and raving about the food. Several years ago, Tofoo Com Chay fixed up a platter of food for me to take to Maui for my daughter. She loved it.< /Text>< Name>

<review>Bare-bones is quite correct.
Not even close to being worth a
special trip to eat Vegetarian food.
Super-tiny inside with few choices,
likely good for locals or the downtown
lunch crowd. Not in the best of areas.<//review>< pictures>

Love going to this place! They have been here for more than ten years Erving vegetarian food at an affordable price to San Jose state university and the people and the community in general. Always fast service; do prepare for crazy lunch traffic so avoid that time of the day. You can request them to modify, example have the pho noodle to go with the yellow noodle. Definitely try this hole in the wall mom and pop Vietnamese vegan place.<//text>

I always thought mocking meat dishes was kind of weird. Especially how detailed some of them are. But the food is gooood. Even if you're a big meat eater, you'll likely find this place really good.

This place was smaller than I expected, kind of hole in the wall.

Bun Bo Hue was good, we also had some items with rice. I'd definitely come back.</text>

I work around the corner from this little shop and come by often. I really love their spicy soup, especially on a cold day. Their rice dishes have pretty hefty portions, enough to save for later. My favorite is the lemon grass tofu. Only complaint is that its not always available. And it's cash only. Not a lot of seating so I usually get it to go. It's a great find.<//Review>

The food was okay, the portions were great but the tofu wasn't great and has to be reheated in a microwave. It was very small sitting area with decent decor and the service was good and friendly but in a hurry for it being 1:30pm on a Tuesday< /review>

Low prices, cash only, does not look fancy at all, but the vegan food tastes great, and they have a big variety of "meat", "fish", "chicken", "sea food" and simply tofu.<//text>

The place has decent vegetarian food, and Bun Bo Hue is always my first choice. The only obsticle is parking, due to the location (near downtown SJ)</text>

<review>The food is old, and the place is dirty. This place might be violating health codes.  But At least it's cheap for those looking to spend less.  I only knocked off One Star because it is still at least a true vegetarian restaurant, and they make awesome vegan turkeys on thanksgiving.< /review>< pictures>

Probably my favorite veg restaurant in SJ! The food is so tastey and the owners and staff are kind and patient. I highly recommend the special fried rice, the teriyaki chicken kababs, the spicy noodle soup, and the vermechelli noodle soup! They DO make the food ahead of time and microwave it, just in case you have a problem with that. It's cash only!< /Text>

Thats exactly how service is supposed to be and we all practice what Buddha tell us - be kind, be generous and you will get back more than what you give. I highly recommend Bamboo noodle and Chicken skewer because they are cheaper and more delicious than rice plates. Overall, its good!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Tofoo Com Chat has really good vegan options that are tasty. You may find sometimes that this place can get packed easily. So getting something like pho would be  a hassle without proper seating. The prices are average but it is normal for vegan restaurants.</review>

<review>Outstanding! The rice vermicelli dish with the grilled pork and egg rolls is truly amazing. The restaurant interior has a very light and open feel - clean and simple. A perfect environment for sampling the delicate flavors of Vietnamese cuisine.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAgR69eDGAWC0dqOpAi66dGc54nUoo_7PHTv6i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiZwqLrDsSerjmxj2dDq5H_hBLw46Ss7kjeUwV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9xirVoZ3jAFF9kLhl9WwZgIqUPpgYi9w2QpZu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQCVPnzN5IRfgJICw93u2X90eHUvr4N0g65Lu6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

<Text>I liked my meal. If you’re looking for a quick option Lotus and Light is great, they’re friendly and the restaurant is clean and comfortable. Portions are huge. The tofu was a little bland, and the noodle salad I ordered didn’t pack the punch I expected.<//Text>< pics>

<username>Andrew Chan< /username><text>I visited on a Friday night. The service was prompt and cheerful but the food could have been served faster.
The beef pho was flavourful and comforting, the pork sausage rolls were well made as well. Iced Vietnamese coffee i ordered reminded me of starbucks but not in a bad way.
A good, unpretentious place to come for comfort food.<//text>< date>

This place rocks. My family planned a 90th birthday party here for my father as a surprise and to quote him, it was “the best day of my life”. The restaurant sat down with us, helped plan the menu for 25 people, including a few special requests like vegan and gluten free options. The food was awesome. Everybody loved it. The service was perfect and we will all be back.< /Text>

<Text>Great New find; you can see and taste the quality. A simple menu with complex flavors & food that will keep you coming back! Although our server was great everyone came and checked on us. The bartender was mixing Valentine's Day concoctions and recruited us to participate in a taste test.

The medium-sized room is elegantly decorated. The bathrooms are large and clean. We arrived for an early dinner, the place was mostly empty. By 6:30 every table was full & there were hungry patrons waiting for a seat. Others picked up to-go orders, so people already know about Lotus and Light. I recommend you check it out, and review it for yourself.

Parking is ample & next door to Starbucks. You can enjoy some shopping or hit the grocery market a few doors down. I highly recommend the 50/50 beef and pork rice (it's not on the menu as 50/50). The meat was so tender and flavorful the sauce included was on point.

I had the beef pho my wife had the vegetable tofu. Mine was rich and flavorful I thought hers was a little bland. Overall everything we sampled was fantastic. The service was great. As you can see on receipt, the price is what you would expect. The quality excellent, the space was bright and clean. I give 5 stars with confidence I will be back save me a table!< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< resp>

<text>Not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. The egg rolls are crispy and delicious. The Bankok rolls are also great. They come with a cilantro/basil sauce that was very delicious. I had the filet mignon with basil dish. Be warned this is hot! Lots and lots of Thai chilis that will set your mouth ablaze. For dessert my wife had the beignet donuts with ice cream. I had an amazing scoop of mango sticky rice ice cream.  It was so good! Overall, good atmosphere, good service, and tasty food.< /text>< pictures>

If you’re looking for good pho do not come here. The broth tasted like cheap cinnamon and ginger tea and the meat was sparse.<//review>

<review>I would recommend this place to anybody who likes Vietnamese food (Thai inspired). We tried the fried tofu, it was super light and super savory (fave). Also recommended would be the Bangkok noodle rolls the pho fillet and the Lotus papaya salad. Just as good as their main entrees and starters are their deserts. Try the Banh flan and my personal favorite the tapioca rice pudding. Oh but if you're into super light and fluffy beignets do the Vietnamese coffee over vanilla ice cream is good too. Did I mention they have a variety of soju cocktails? Yeah. They do. Try their version of the East Side.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORqM1RqYvtHqP8WcEyvYc6x7P_xSVDJUYavMWw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwtp9SnqzhBK3Mnmvxi7bl0Jp82_FiUwC8SGZl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Last week was our first time we went to this place. But It is obviously not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the excellent service, with the exceptional  dishes and fine drinks and with the decent payment. We will absolutely come back soon.< /Text>

A great lunch spot for Vietnamese food. It's clean and modern looking. One of the nicer restaurants in this plaza. The beignets are the underrated hit here. If you have enough room for dessert, definitely order it.< /text>

The food was delicious but the place is clearly understaffed for how busy they are.  Our apps came out quickly but the pho is taking a ridiculous amount of time to follow.  I feel bad watching these two young women try to keep up with seating people, taking orders, bussing tables, serving food and handling the takeout orders.</Text>

This place was a wholesome experience. Friendly staff, pleasant ambience and yummy food made it great.

I would make an attempt to visit it during my next trip to LA.</review>< response>

Really interesting and crispy egg rolls with pork mushroom filling. Pho broth is very light and mild and almost a butter flavor in it. Overall pretty good soup!</Review>

All appetizers were so good. I didn’t like pho as much as other dishes because it was too much grease floating to the top of the soup. Bangkok rolls was my favorite. Drinks are fantastic.< /Review>

<review>My father and I were in the area and we thought we'd come to check this place out. If I'm not mistaken, they just opened. The owner and staff here at Lotus & Light are nice and attentive. We ordered the spring rolls and egg rolls, and pho. The spring roll was refreshing and had a good snap. The egg rolls had a great crispy crunch without being too oily. The pho broth had a lot of flavor. Definitely worth coming by if you enjoy great service and amazing food!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

They were very busy the night we came in, but the servers were both so sweet and kind the whole time. The food was fantastic and they gave us a giftcard for a future visit due to longer wait times. Would highly recommend the pho and spring rolls!< /text>

Amazing! I am very picky with my pho and this broth is very tasty, you don’t have to add anything to it. But my favorite dishes here that are different from other places are charbroiled pork or beef bun -vermicelli and the filet mignon basil chili if you like spicy!!!<//review>

Fresh food, variety house made drinks, friendly staff. Everything I've eaten here was good from the garlic ginger rice, daily house made pho broths, giant prawns, my favorite is the chilli filet and thier bun, and they make all of the desserts from scratch I love the baked beignet and the mango rice ice cream, soooooooooo gooooodddd. Did i mention that the baked beignet comes affogato Style With really good drip expresso....ugh my mouth is watering lol<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>If you love Golden Deli in San Gabriel you'll love this place more. It's great that I finally don't have to drive all the way to the SGV to get my fix of authentic pho.

What makes this particular pho place stand out from the billion of other pho places in Los Angeles is how darn clean their pho tastes. It doesn't have any MSG, they either use no salt or very little so you can apply your own level of sodium chloride to your liking. The best part of it is the pho broth is SO DANG rich and perfect it doesn't need anything extra. This place has unexpectedly become my new favorite restaurant after a workout. It always makes my body feel like I'm filling it with nutrients and not just a pho equivalent of nightQuil that I need to lay down to digest for several hours after eating.

The same level of rich brothness is the same for their for their veggie pho. The broth is an incredibly rich umami shiitake broth. I've never had a veggie pho that the broth ever stood out like that. It's really really good. They also must steam their veggies over broth because all the steamed veggies were full of the same rich broth flavor. It's as good as their beef pho.

This is also the only pho place that I'll eat tendon in my pho. I appreciate that they cut it up into edible small bite size pieces that are appealing and easy to eat.

Their crunchy wraps and veggie spring roll wraps are also killer. The prices are also very fair for the level of quality you get.

Another small thing that is nice. The noodles in the pho are cooked to order. Have you ever been to a restaurant when you get your pho you have to try to separate all the noodles from being stuck together in a dense ball because they were prepared an hour ago? You won't have that problem here.</Review>< pictures>

I did not personally get food here, but I'll give it a review since Google asked me to.

I gave my mother-in-law a ride to this establishment.

I noticed that the parking was not a problem. That's a plus.

Food was hot and ready and delicious!

My mother-in-law was almost in and out of it. In other words, this place has professional and quick staff.

I'd say the price was not bad at all because mother-in-law paid for my food. She's very frugal. (I hope she doesn't see this review though)

All in all, this place hasn't let me down. I don't believe I'll ever see that day.</Text>

I know, this is a fast food chain, and the quality and service is expected. Let me tell you, the customer service from the two girls in the front was Excellent, I never do reviews for big fast food chains, but they were soooo welcoming and nice, it definitely caught my attention and appreciation. The food was perfect, presentation perfect and customer service perfect. It excel all my expectations. Bravo to this wonderful Girls, keep it up. I don’t remember their names but it was on the shift of Wednesday 11/28/2018 at 9:45p.< /Text>

Food was good. Better then the Popeyes in NoHo. But the guy working the outside has an attitude problem. This is the second time I visit and the same guy hating life or something.<//Text>

Why was in Granbury to Popeye's and was fantastic chicken breasts or just for today for let me tell you they charge you $2 more but it's okay it's worth it don't know the tradition of value on a chicken breast on a dark meat has all the protein you need and all the stuff that you need to be healthy breast I love the best that's how it's always been< /Review>

I ordered a 4 piece with Mashed Potatoes and Apple pie. All the Chicken was old, dry and cold. Mashed potatoes were half filled and the Gravy was already in clumps from sitting. The  apple pie was so old there was hardly anymore filling . Horrible experience< /Text>

<Review>Haven't had Popeyes in a while and decided to give it a try. Disappointed everything comes spicy or mild since I'm not a fan of spice and am pretty sensitive to it. First time having it in years and probably won't have it again anytime soon. Staff were ok but we asked for ranch and they said it was in the bag but by the time we got to the park to eat we realized they didn't give us any sauces at all for any of our food. Store did appear clean and they had people wait for food outside due to COVID so thats good. If you like Popeyes then sure I'd recommend this location,  just double check your order has everything you asked for before leaving.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Popeye's as a chain is an average fried chicken place. Nothing special. This particular store has a terrific staff though. Probably won't return, but that is more a commentary on the food than the store.<//text>

<Review>came here for the infamous chicken sandwich. FYI currently they are only
serving them between 11am-7pm. my group got into line around 6pm and there was a short wait. we ordered and were served our food relatively quickly. the shop was busy due to the #hype but overall we found a place to sit and the food was enjoyable. good price and glad i got to try the sandwich. got a combo which came with a drink and a side.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Ordered 3 piece All-White meat combo. Took the order home. Opened the box to find only 1 piece white meat (40% of which was bone) and two pieces of end of chicken wings. It's infuriating how these joints assume all people are uneducated and unintelligent. Returned to the store and the manager who had a bad attitude said that "Wings are considered White Meat". Wings that are 80% bone and skin are now "considered" white meat?! They ought to change the definition of white meat in the dictionary to be more transparent to people. What a scam. Returned my food for full refund.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c295410fad872b:0x4f2ebc63245286d1</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The Service: Very efficient.

The Food: Time to try their famous Spicy Chicken Sandwich~

Mmmmm... $3.99 for a consider small sandwich. Size? The chicken definitely smaller piece than the advertised one. Price? Okay. Spicy? Not at all! Crunchy? Yes, they do have good batter.

Was it that good to wait in long line? Sorry... I will pass.

The Parking: Plaza parking lot< /review>

<response>None</response><text>The best fried chicken of all the fast food chains! Right now busy because of the chicken sandwich buzz. Had to give it 4 stars only because no bathrooms for those dining in. Not a problem for us as we usually go for the family meal deals. My favorite sides are the red beans and rice and the Cole slaw.  Remember to ask for the butter and honey for the biscuits- none of our local Popeyes automatically put these items in the take out bag but they are happy to do so on request.< /text><Date>1574120457705</Date>< user_id>

Got my order wrong today. Spoke with manager Arturo was very rude and not helpful. Since they didn’t give me my receipt, even though I just left. He couldn’t help me and give me a refund. Very poor service and wasted money.< /Review>

Very crowded as there were a lot of people who were getting the chicken sandwich.  I was there for the managers special (all dark meat) and they did not have enough so they offered white meat to get me my food earlier.  Considering the crowd, they did a good job with customer service.< /review>

<Review>Pretty fast service here, especially during the chicken sando craze of 2019/2020. Clean and swift, what more could you ask for from a fast food chicken joint?< /Review>< Date>

Firstly the store didn't get the order.

Then store doesn't honor the mobile offer.

Then they refused to serve me what I paid for.

This is the most embarrassing experience I ever had and they don't even know whether I will get refund.

Worst service and the store had a sign saying they will make sure the customers are   always happy. What a joke.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>I went in during mid day looking for the sandwich that was advertised all over the television. They are out. I have been to the Glendale, Montebello and now Burbank and can never get the sale sandwich only tender dinners available what is going on. The tender dinners are more expensive and not necessary. Chicken is good no doubt just feels like bate and switch.< /text>< pics>

It is exactly what you'd expect from a popeyes in a strip mall. Just the food you like, with none of the frills. Its clean, but kind of dingy. The staff was friendly and the food was good.<//text>

3 stars because the cashier made sure i finally got my order after waiting a legit 20 mins for only 2 large side of red beans and rice with mashed potatoes. . . The manager who is also the one making sure the orders make it out properly kept staring at me and not once asked sir have you got your order yet especially after 20 mins and the store was at a moderate to low flow<//Review>

<Time>1573252348121</Time><Rating>4</Rating><Text>Review of Classic Chicken Sandwich combo: For 6.99, this was a great price. The chicken was moist, and outer batter had a nice crunch. The sandwich is really simple, just mayo, pickles and chicken. Cajun fries were okay, but weren't anything special. I would prefer this chicken sandwich to chick fil a's, although from a wholistic view, would prefer chick fil a because of their sauce and waffle fries. But this is a good basic chicken sandwich, and I only waited 20 min for it rather than the normal 2 hour wait at Howlin Ray's.<//Text>< Pics>

Their sandwich was a disappointment. Who ever heard of a restaurant without a bathroom?
At least the staff was friendly.< /review>

Ordered shrimp tackle box, but they gave me a popcorn shrimp box. When I corrected them they said “yeah, we ran out of the other shrimp so we gave you that one.” I would have appreciated knowing that before I ordered. Sides were ok tho, and the food came fast even if it was wrong.< /text>

Standard Popeye's franchise chain. Competent staff and good service.

They are probably the best of the chain for ten miles. Also, if you're a fan of paying via NFC, they've got you covered.<//Review>

Super friendly service. She explained menu details and gave options based on what she heard I was wanting. Refreshingly optimistic personality made my visit pleasant and an excellent take out meal experience. So hats off to this Burbank, Popeyes location! PS love Popeyes food.<//Text>

This Popeyes is usually really fast to get their food out the door, however the more I come here the more I notice that they forget items or even mess up orders. I recommend them but don't expect it to be five stars all the time. It's an average Popeyes compared to the rest, so three stars.< /Review>

Popeyes come up with new sandwich, this is a chicken fast food but it is a failure.  Early in the morning, as soon as they open, posted on the door, chicken sandwich sold out.  They should remove it from their menu.  Looser!<//Text>

I think Popeyes is very good. The service is always excellent however the chicken is good both the mild and the spicy and the blackened. With all the fancy fried chicken places popping up that are incredibly expensive Popeyes is so really affordable< /Text>

<Text>This location has really gone downhill over the last few months.  Looks like there's a new manager and a couple new staff workers. Slow service with no sense of urgency by workers, from the manager on down.  Always check your order, trust me on that.</Text>< Pics>

Absolutely horrible!  I called because they forgot to add the red beans and rice I ordered. The person on the phone told me since it was Uber who picked up my order, they have no way to verify if “that was true”... so they basically accused me of lying about it! When I asked to talk to the manager they said she wasn’t in. So I asked for the manager’s name. She told me she didn’t know it. I asked if there was an Asst Manager I could talk to, and she said there wasn’t one working. I asked who was in charge, she sighed, got defensive and said “hold on”. The person who came to the phone, refused to tell me her name, but told me they can’t do anything, but said I could call and “talk to Mary in the morning”, but it probably wouldn’t help because they have no way of knowing if I actually got what I ordered, or if the Uber driver screwed up.

NEVER AGAIN will I ever order from this place again!!< /Review>

I'm kinda a Popeye's officinado. Whatever... I like a good chicken strip. *shrug* The food at this location was meh. Fries were half warm and mushy, strips a bit rubbery. It was a little after lunch too... shoulda been fresh but wasn't. Honestly, not much else to note about the visit. Everyone was nice enough. A solid 3 was had by all.<//Review>
