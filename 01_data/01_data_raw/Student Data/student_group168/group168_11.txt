They only have one flavor is pizza and salad each day. Always vegetarian.

You can check the flavors on their website. Each store has diff flavor everyday.

If you buy the whole pie you can customize it.

Always comes with an extra sliver!< /Review>

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The pizza they served was so delicious and satisfying. I like the crunchy pizza of their thin crusts. The cheese was completely melted. Ahh! Ahh! What a lovely place to eat pizza!< /Text>< Pics>

Consistently excellent. And fast too. Crust is thin as i prefer.

Tonight, Monday Oakland's sliced tomatoes, goat cheese, and onions was the best yet.<//review>

Clean, well-lit, and beautiful. Great signages to remind people of proper social distancing. Staff members are friendly and nice. And of course, pizzas are amazing. Walked away with straight happiness :)<//Review>

Ordered a triple mushroom pizza to go. The pizza came with this delicious green sauce that was similar to a chimichura sauce. Would come back again.< /review>

Do not go here for traditional pizza styles. You have to get their pizza of the day, otherwise you can't get slices or customize anything. Their 'cheese' pizza, doesn't come with tomato sauce even. The options here are pathetic, but apparently if you like the wild flavors and lack of customization, then this place might be for you.<//Review>

Little Star is pretty much perfect pizza as far as I'm concerned. Had some take out with friends last night as we curled up for a lazy hungover Saturday evening hanging out on the couch. Great deep dish, still need to try the shallow dish.< /Text>

Truly delicious pizza. The crust is crisp and just the right thickness, and I'm always surprised by whatever the pizza of the day is. In my top 3 pizza spots in the bay area, hands down.

The fresh sauces they make to go with their daily pizza are also something you shouldn't miss, they're designed to go together.</Review>

I absolutely love this pizza and concept. I have never had a slice I didn't like, and their hot sauces you put on the pizza are great additions. In every other pizza world I get pepperoni and black olives every time. Here there is one vegetarian pizza each day. When you get a slice you always get like a half slice with it (thus the name sliver) And if that isn't enough, you can get local beers on tap that run under $5.  They also seem to do a lot for charity.< /Text>

<text>Interesting pizza joint with Dailey rotating pizzas and salads.  Come for the pizza, stay for that green sauce.  Yes it's worth buying the 8oz of it, I use it on everything.< /text>< gmapID>

The pizza is good. I wasn't so excited about the space, a bit loud. They did have a nice jazz trio playing. There is some outdoor seating, too. They have a few craft beers on draught, and some decent non-alcoholic drinks, too. The staff was fast and good natured which was impressive because there were only two of them.</Review>

Sliver pizzeria indulges in satisfying their customers. Their unique pizza is something no other pizzeria can create. Their service is undeniably great; their servers are generous, conversational, and always smiling. My college friends and I couldn't wait to come home from break-in fact- the first thing we did together as a group was get one big box of pizza and share. This is truly our happy place. ❣<//text>

Shocked how many good reviews there are. This pizza is flavorless. Soggy cardboard crust with stick-to-your-teeth-dry pizza-hut-grade cheese and NO SAUCE. It ate like a dry quesadilla. The pizza of the day was slightly better than the cheese but both were worse than frozen pizzas.. Save your money and get a frozen 'za from Safeway.

Service was fast and very nice.< /review>

<review>Ordered two cheese pizzas last night and when I received them there was no sauce on them. Who in their right mind thinks cheese pizza just means cheese, I come from the world of pizza and a cheese pizza is pizza sauce, mozzarella on top of pizza dough. If you can’t get that right then you got major problems. DO NOT GET THIS PIZZA!!!<//review><Name>Kevin Waeschle< /Name><Date>1548510018855< /Date><user>100621547458619755420< /user><pics>None<//pics>< gmapID>

Pizza with no sauce. Not even a little. Just thin crust and reheated cheese and toppings. I gave an extra star because the 8” warm brownies are the one delicious item on the menu.</Text>

<text>Always great despite the toppings! I'd come here any day to grab a slice.

Tip: Try the green chimichurri sauce! It was great and you can even take some in small to-go containers. You will end up using a lot per slice!< /text><gmap_id>0x80857d2d44fc7ecb:0x425fd1a2c7194ac5<//gmap_id>< Pics>

Went with family for the first time today and fell in love with the place! Staff was phenomenal, super informative about their food, the menu and amazing personalities. Wonderful people+ wonderful food= happy customer. Had to run back inside after my slice to order a whole pizza to take home<//review>

Very yummy vegetarian pizza in a casual setting. They only make one type of pizza a day, so you don't have to waste time or thought choosing, and each pizza is excellent. Definitely try the green sauce on your slice. The outdoor tables look like they'll be great when the weather gets warmer.<//Text>

We had a vegetarian pizza and it was delicious.  I loved the thin crust, no sauce, vege pizza. It was full of flavor. Sliver also has a cilantro or tomato based hot sauces on the side if you like.< /Review>

One type of veggie pizza a day with sourdough crust and always excellent by the slice, half, or whole pie. I’ve been to their original and current Berkeley locations many times before and the staff at this one are so incredibly nice that I had to write a review. Thanks for coming to this neighborhood!!</Review>

I didn't taste the food so I really can't comment. But Only one choice of pizza and one choice for salad. WTH SMH I couldn't get pass that and if you want cheese only you have to buy an entire pizza. What the what< /Review>

Didn’t like the new location. Feels like a very watered down version of the original in Berkeley. Falls right in line with the strip mall surrounding it. Pizza had very few toppings. I would expect more for $30. The music was terrible which maybe wouldn’t have been so bad had it not been blaring. I sat outside in the cold to avoid it.</text>

Another pizza shop in the East Bay with Arizmendi DNA, this chain is the brainchild of a former worker at Berkeley cheese board Pizza collective. Newly installed in the Rockridge shopping center, this is sure to be a big hit in the area, since there is no other Pizza like it in the area. Word to the yum yum.
If you want to know what I mean by Arizmendi DNA, think of delicious pizza but with a crust that is so delicious you can eat it alone without toppings, a kind of chewy fragrant sourdough that they could sell  as bread all on its own. Kind of like putting Pizza on top of a high class focaccia.
Add to that the classic cheese board Pizza collective sauces and toppings, and a rather reasonable price, equals big fun for newcomers to this old pizza recipe sold in a new school joint.< /text>

Sauce comes separately, so is this even pizza? Two types: cheese or "pizza" of the day. Two sauces for dipping: tonight at least was a pesto and a spicy red (not a marinara.)  I would not recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

<text>Cheese pizzas had no sauce. Nowhere on their menu did they make this clear and at those prices it's a complete rip off. Cashier was unable to give me a refund because he didn't have the proper permissions on their ipad register. He had to give me cash which was awkward and frankly not really what I wanted.< /text>< pics>

We had an accidental sprinkler activation Sunday night (not related to fire or smoke) and Blackbird Fire was quick to respond and took care of us so we could open for business the next morning. It was late Sunday, Mothers Day, but they still responded right away. The work crew was professional and the price was very reasonable. We definitely recommend their work and service.</Text>

So happy we found Black Bird Fire Protection inc. to service our vehicle's fire extinguisher. Just in time for our off road trip. Luis Robles was very knowledgeable and helpful through the whole process. He made sure he could actually service our extinguisher FIRST before actually going there, to save me an unnecessary trip. Above and beyond service like that, does not go unnoticed. We will definitely come back the next time we need another service. thank you again we really appreciate everything you did for us.<//Review>

< review>
I happened upon Blackbird from a Yelp search. I did not know of them beforehand. Richard was awesome. Responded within an hour of my inquiry. Got my multi unit investment property's 5 yr fire inspection done quickly and quoted repairs same day. He performed repairs and re certification within the week. He came in 15% less than the original company I went with but more importantly his customer service, knowledge base, and quick turn around was what impressed me most... he's a nice guy.< /review>

My name is Gary Wojciechowski, I work for Ace Relocation Systems in Long Beach Ca. i want to give a big shout out to Luis Robles, he is always Polite Professional and Punctual. It is always a good time when he comes into my office to service our fire safety system. I wish they could clone Luis so i could hire one of here. I could use a guy like him.<//text>

I had to get a sprinkler fixed after an inspection.  Richard and his team went through and inspected every sprinkler and not only did they fix one sprinkler but fixed others that weren’t identified on the inspection report just to be safe!  And at no additional cost.  They were quick and efficient and very reasonable compared to another quote I got.  Richard coordinated things with my landlord and the whole job was seamless!  Thank you!</review>

We're very happy with our experience with Black Bird. After receiving a fire report for one of our buildings from the L.A. Fire Department, one of the issues we needed to address was bringing all of our fire extinguishers up to date. Luis came and was very professional, and kindly and thoroughly
answered all of our questions and concerns. Our extinguishers needed to be replaced with new ones, and it turns out our existing cabinets for them were not at regulation height (too high), and we'd need to outfit them with small hammers. Luis gave us recommendations on better places to relocate our less-visible extinguishers and moved them. He was also mindful of saving us the cost of purchasing new cabinets and said he'd use the existing cabinets, lowering them on the wall to the correct height and outfitting them with a new poly-scored plexiglass cover that could be broken open without a hammer. He also threw in new locks for them all, which was great. He did all of it that same day as the consultation.

There were other issues we needed to address on the fire report, and normally Black Bird could have handled them if our building had been located completely in Culver City; unfortunately, it's located right on the line between Culver City and the City of Los Angeles, falling more under the jurisdiction of L.A. city which requires a Regulation 4 testing certification. But Luis was happy to refer us directly to an affiliate fire protection company that could handle it, which we really appreciated.

Overall, it was very easy to work with Black Bird, and Luis walked us through each issue ticked on the fire report so we'd have a clear understanding of what we needed to do.< /text>

Wow! Richard and staff: Excellent communication, excellent work, highly recommended!  I would give 6 stars if able to...   I have a condo on PCH in Huntington Beach where the copper pipe sprinkler system continually leaks and causes damage— all the pipes are eroded— most companies wouldn’t even take the job when interviewed since they were connected condos and not freestanding with HOA oversight— Richard came through with everything promised!  Thank you Blackbird!!<//Review>

Richard was the technician who performed our work.  We needed an inspection and certification of our residential sprinkler system.  He also adjusted two heads that had "drooped" over time.  Some caps needed replacing and everything was performed in a very professional way at a very fair price.  Richard was professional and congenial.  I would not hire anyone else to perform service on our sprinkler system.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>My home's fire sprinkler pressure relief valve and pressure gauge was malfunctioning, causing water to leak outside the house, promoting unsightly moss growth. Black Bird Fire Protection came out and replaced the defective parts. They had great service and the response was prompt.  Richard provided a thorough service and took great care to avoid water leaks during the repair work. I recommend them highly.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Luis came out to service our restaurant fire protection system.  He is puntual, knowledgeable, and honest with what need to be serviced. I found out that the old company I used skipped some works, and they had charged me for what they didn't do because I did not understand what needs to be done.  Luis took time ro explain us how fire supression system works, and what to look out for.  10 stars!  Thank you Blackbird.< /text>

<name>Billy Nicholson< /name><text>We needed new counters in our kitchen. We requested this company to send out their interior designer who met my wife, discussed how the kitchen was used to determine the best type counter for our kitchen. She along with the project engineer worked closely with my wife Alice o select the best counter at the best price and was able to make modifications to our kitchen to give it a fresh new look and improve the workspace. After a short period of time, their fixation team arrived and fitted a counter perfectly into our kitchen. The company kept us informed throughout the process. We are very pleased with the experience and our kitchen looks great!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>As you do before making an large purchase we looked at MANY kitchen design companies. We choose them because they did exactly what we asked for and didn’t try to up the cost by including features we wouldn’t use as a family. The end result is absolutely stunning and exceeded our expectations. All of us at home are enjoying and loving the new look of kitchen. It immensely gives pleasure when your heard earned money is well spent. More over every member of the team were perfectionists and we wouldn’t hesitate in using them again or recommending .Thank you !< /Text></record>

The team at LAR Construction remodeled my kitchen and it completely changed everything in my house! The new kitchen makes my dining room and living room look bigger and brighter. The kitchen is very modern and just the way I had pictured it. Sharon was my initial contact and he was beyond helpful and professional in the remodeling process. They were very clear and upfront about the cost and time frame of the remodeling. Everything went well and now I can enjoy my beautiful kitchen. These guys know what they're doing and don't waste time. I recommend them !<//review>

It was a great decision to hire LAR Construction to remodel our kitchen and two bathrooms. We talked to several contractors, but felt most comfortable with Synergy and their quote was also very reasonable. Sharon is very professional and great at managing the project. He gave us frequent and timely updates on the progress and always gave us options on how to tackle the issue. And he was always on-site working with his crew. His crew was also very courteous and professional. They took pride in their craftsmanship. They had to work day and night to get us back into our house under a tight deadline, however, they didn't compromise their quality. Everyone who has seen the kitchen and bathrooms was impressed. As with any remodeling, there were setbacks and challenges, but Sharon and his crew were always on top of everything and we felt that they had our best interests in mind. We liked the crew so much that we kept expanding the scope of the project and they finished everything with quality and timeliness. We'd recommend Sharon and his crew to anyone planning a remodeling. In fact, we are already starting to plan our next project for Sharon and LAR Construction and Remodeling.< /review>

LAR Construction and Remodeling did a major addition for us. They were so amazing to work with. Incredibly trustworthy and just genuinely nice people. Sharon is the most organized and trustworthy contractor I've worked with to date. And his crew has such fantastic attention to detail and was so understanding of all of our additional requests. It really felt like they truly cared about us, our family, and our home. We absolutely consider them part of our family now and will be using them for any future home renovation needs.</review>

<text>If I could give more stars I would. My bathroom remodel is beautiful. Sharon is honest and fair. He told me step by step what was going to be done. The workers were at my house every day until the project was done. This was the first time I did a remodel by myself and I was apprehensive about the cost and the time frame. Sharon was professional and so helpful. I am very happy I went with Sharon. I would highly recommend them.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We are very glad that we hired LAR Construction and Remodeling to remodel our kitchen. We came into contact with someone who works here and they were so nice and professional. We asked for a quote and felt that they were very fair with their prices. We gave them a layout and showed them exactly what we wanted. They tweaked a few things for the better. The remodeling took about a few weeks. you won't believe your eyes if you see the before and after. It completely changed our home and we are very happy! Great work guys!</Text>

Sharon and team are a pleasure to work with. Very professional, detail-Sharonented, meticulous, easy to talk to and experienced. You can tell they are real pros at home improvement and know precisely what they were doing. I got the best quote from them for my home and I can't be more pleased with the results of the project. High quality home remodeling with the best service and best price. What more can I ask for?< /Review>

We bought a house that needed a serious upgrades in the kitchen and bathrooms. After talking with a few contractors we decided to go with Sharon from LAR Construction. It was clearly he knows what he is doing, his price was fair. Throughout the project he was honest and professional. I can talk for hours about our process and how happy we are. You choose them you know that even if obstacles occurred during the project you are in a good hands. We will definitely use this company again!<//text>

<text>Sharon and his team remodeled both of our bathrooms, and we are thrilled with the outcome. They were very considerate of our home and keeping things clean. Sharon kept in touch with us throughout the process keeping us updated and checking in for any questions. The work was excellent, the price was fair, and the communication was superb. You will not find a better contractor. Thank you!<//text>< date>

LAR Construction and Remodeling provided excellent design recommendations for our master bath. Once a design/layout was agreed upon, we were provided 3D images of what the end product would look like, once the project was completed, it was amazing on how accurate the plan images were compared to the actual bathroom! We are definitely pleased.</review>

<review>We just hired LAR Construction & Remodeling for our kitchen and bathroom remodeling project at our house and we were so happy and impressed by them. Based on our experience with them and mainly with David we can say here that this is a wonderful construction company to hire and work with! They are very honest, stable, and skilled. The main of the work was based on David Supervision and management skills. He was always on top of everything and he made sure to be at our house each day and to make sure that everyone is doing his part on the best side and without any mistake. Few times we noticed that he threat this remodeling as it was for his own house and we really appreciated that fact. On top of that, all the paper work was handled in a very professional manner and this combination of David and the office, made this remodeling a very easy and convenient project. We want to really thank them for everything they did at our house.<//review></record>

<Review>I worked with Sharon from Lar Construction and it was a great experience. I made multiple request over the job period and he was fully accommodating. This was my first remodeling experience and I naturally had lots of questions to which Sharon patiently explained. At the end of the job, I had some minor touch up requests and they came by multiple times to fix it. All in, great experience!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>It's hard to find good contractors out there. I needed someone to remodel my bathrooms and kitchen and Lar Construction helped me out with the process. It's always nice having a service that will be there for you when you have questions or need advice. Sharon was super helpful during the whole renovation process and the contractors were friendly and took pride in their work. Next time I need a remodeling done to my other rooms, LAR Construction and Remodeling will be the first people I call!<//Review>< Pics>

David and his crew, were exceptional in the demo, construction and installation process. Everything was completed in a timely fashion.We would highly recommend LAR Construction to anyone in need of a renovation no matter how small or large of a project they are planning.</review><time>1599854536818<//time><user>106815036032423101025< /user>< rating>

I had my bathroom renovated by LAR Construction and Remodeling. Everything went smoothly and I love the bathroom.The design process was easy and fun - and the actual construction took 2 1/2 weeks from start to finish. I often hear disaster stories that renovations can take months, but all the materials came on time, David and his workers were super professional.Next thing you know it, I had a bathroom of my dreams. All in all - love it - thank you David.</Text>

My parents are very happy with Lar Construction, Sharon came out and gave us a real good comparative price and yet was very knowledgeable to predict more issues that might come along with our kitchen addition project. From start to finish great job! Sharon was very responsive to all our questions and concerns dealing with problems and solved them right away. There different teams makes the job a lot quicker and really efficient. Our house got a lot bigger and open. My parents will definitely call Sharon and Lar Construction Builders for our next project.</Text>

We are beyond thrilled with the outcome of our kitchen and first floor remodel project. From start to finish and even after, LAR Construction team led by our designer Sharon was wonderful to work.Sharon is an exceptional listener who created a design that balanced our family's needs and provided both function and the right amount of form. The pride of work and craftsmanship was as if the team was working on their own home.<//Review>

Sharon and his team did a wonderful job on our kitchen remodel. We're in an older house and had lots of challenges with walls and floors that weren't quite straight/level. Sharon provided lots of solutions to help fix or manage all of the issues, and was able to handle a lot of additional modifications beyond the cabinets. He came up with a great approach for rerunning some of our plumbing and electricity that allowed us to have the kitchen we originally imagined in the space. Very prompt, precise and always left everything clean and in order while working. Very appreciative of their work.</text>

Was pleasure to work with David. Our apartment's bathroom glaze looks fantastic, a major improvement from the pink nightmare that it was! When we showed the apartment, realtors and prospects raved about how nice it was! David also responded very quickly when I notified him about a minor chip that occurred months later. We're so impressed with this glaze job that we'll be doing the rest of our bathrooms.< /Review>

<time>1604204539660< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Avoid this company. There are reasons that almost every review in Yelp has one star.

Site Monitoring, Client Communication, Material Order, and Schedule management should be the base of work, and you cannot expect anything with LAR Construction and Remodeling.

1. You will get no information about your project.

1) Sharon does not have any information to give you.

Sharon did not know what happened to your project at least for a long time. Actually, he could not know because he hired another company and he never came to the site except when picking up checks.

Your project could be also paused for weeks and sometimes months and Sharon will not know about the paused status before you told him or sometimes he will blame you for the delay.

It was a Bathroom remodeling project. He missed ordering a vanity and refused any help. It was actually his work that we paid for. Anyway I had to find another store and ordered the vanity all by myself.

2) You can not even guess how much it will take.

My project was about to take about 4~5 months, but it took exactly 12 months after the contract. I first thought some delay was caused by the COVID-19 but clearly, that was not.

2. You will always meet his uncontrolled temper-based service.

Sharon did not have any interest in controlling his tempers and he always showed them to me. So, you will hear his angry voice every time you talk with him, which is still surprising to me.

1) You cannot easily talk to him by phone or in person.

Sharon did not even reply to my text or call especially for the first few months. So, I had to ask the guys he hired for the progress update and I also had to find all the issues that need to be fixed. I still do not know if there are any remaining issues that I didn't notice.

*update: Sharon will send you a text message in a few seconds after you post this review in yelp starting with "Really????". I should have known this much faster way to communicate with him earlier.

Sometimes, right after I called Sharon that he did not pick up his phone, I asked the guy working in my house to call him. And he always answered his phone.

He also had trouble with some store manager because he left the toilet for more than 7~8 months in the manager's storage and I had to pick it up by myself because the store manager refused to give it to him.

2) You have to make several appointments to talk with him just one time.

We always asked him to make a schedule to come home especially because we were busy working at home. But he mostly sent me a text right before he comes in.

And even when we made a schedule, he did not show up. He never said sorry or tried to make another meeting. So, You have to.

There was a funny story to share that I still remember. When I asked him to come by and he replied it in 1 hour about the available time, but after 30 minutes, he sent me another text to cancel saying that it is because I didn't reply to his text.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Recently had my bath redone including new flooring and installing a walking shower. The designer Danielle, provided an excellent presentation regarding my needs for the bathroom. David and his crew did the installation. Were truly highly qualified professionals. Arrived with masks and gloves and made sure not to take off the masks the whole time while working. This was very important to us during this pandemic.  The crew took great pride in performing their work. Did a wonderful job of cleaning up. Showed up on time and completed the project sooner than expected.
It was a very satisfying experience dealing with this fine people. I highly recommend LAR Construction and Remodeling to anyone.<//text>

<review>David and his team came and diagnosed our problem very quickly. They seem very knowledgeable and their response time was quick. Unfortunately, they do not do the type of work our roof required (tar work, etc.), but I will absolutely call them for any other roof-related issue we have in the future without hesitation. Thank you both!<//review>< Pics>

David is a consummate professional who takes the time to listen, analyze and design wonderful kitchens and baths.He has done two complete kitchens for us and has the genius to look at a space creatively and develop a design that her competition fails to see. I would recommend Ian work to any one looking for innovative design and state of the art kitchens and baths.</text>

Sharon assigned David to remodel our bathroom. David arrived  to the job on time and worked continually throughout the day. He was quiet while working, and very respectful to me and my home. David made it a priority to install the shower in timely manner, as he was made aware that it was the only one in our house. David was the only person working on our project, he handled all of the plumbing, electrical and painting. He was great at addressing questions and concerns. We can't thank David enough for our new bathroom. He is truly talented in his profession, and should be considered an asset to LAR Construction & Remodeling.  Reasonable cost, quality service, pleasure to do business with. Thank you!<//review>

Sharon did a great job for us. We were in a jam and surprised that our roof sprung a leak during the last rainy session. We went a year without much rain. Sharon and his crew patched it up quickly and helped us reduce damage to our interior ceiling and wood flooring. He even came back to confirm that more didn't need to be done. In an age where I feel like a lot of people nickel and dime you for showing up, Sharon did an honest and thorough job. I would refer him to others.<//review>

Great customer service and prompt attention. I called LAR Contractions to get an estimate on doing work at my home. While admitting I have not had the work done yet of all the contractors I called LAR Constructions was the fastest response and the estimate came promptly. Price seems fair, but I'm very impressed with the customer service.< /review>

<Date>1526567018592< /Date><rating>5< /rating><text>We were searching for someone that can do some major remodeling for our house that was in a need for some serious upgrades and updates. Due to some personal issues, we decided to wait with the major remodeling and to do our kitchen and master bathroom so we moved forward with that goal. Eli came out and quickly figured out what we were looking to do and he was very clear about the time frames and overall costs. Eli was very resourceful with the designs that he did for us and he gave us a great direction when we had doubts about paint colors, type of materials and light fixtures. Eli and his skilled team gave us a range of starting dates because of few pending projects that they had this was more than fine with us. As the starting date for the work got closer, Eli kept us informed about all the materials that they ordered for us and he came over to make sure that they were delivered on time. This was a huge advantage because at the end, this more made the work run smoothly and without any additional delay. The work took a little over 5 weeks (including the installation of a custom made shower glass and mirror that were order. The team was very nice and polite to us while they worked very hard with attention to all details and perfection. They worked from 8 to 5 or even 6 each day and they did their best to not bother the rest of the house. We are very happy with the results of their work! The final price was very fair and it didn’t change at all. The quality of the work is much better than we thought it will be. We would highly recommend Eli and his crew.</text>< pictures>

LAR Construction & Remodeling has been great company to work with and to hire for my project. I remember that while we were in a search to buy a house, we passed by a home that was in a process of remodeling and we loved what we saw from the outside. We even spoke to the person there (which was the owner of the house) and he said great things about his contractor, so we took from him the number just in case we will need it in the future. We knew that we have to hire this company to come over and to see what we will do for our new house when we buy one. After we purchased our house, we needed to do several improvements and we had strict budget for that in which we thought that it will be the best to call this contractor and to ask him to come over and check out what we want. What we did not know is that someday after purchasing our house and live there for close to a year, we will have unknowingly twist of luck that will require us to have a contractor come over and correct the problems and issues. The copper pipes were no good and exploded after we had a leak and cracking tiles throughout the home at the time of purchase. I wish it would have been under easier circumstances but thank god, we still had the contact information of this contractor. After contacting Gili from LAR Construction & Remodeling, we scheduled a meeting for him to come over and see the problems AND to give us estimate to remodel the kitchen, 2 bathrooms and the master bedroom. Gili and the workers from LAR Construction & Remodeling were on top of things and did a fantastic work in a pretty good timeframe. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone!  I mean that not many contractors are capable to perform big project such as ours and mainly on time and as agreed. We originally expected from the first contractor that we meet and asked for estimate will be able to at least provide some referrals that can confirm the works that they did. We quickly learned that all contracting companies are not the same. We feel very lucky to have Gili and his team worked at our house. The team and Gili fixed, rebuilt, replaced, improved, painted, hanged, washed, installed and repaired everything we agreed and even more and all of that in order to make our home functional and beautiful again.  We cannot express with enough words our gratitude to LAR Construction & Remodeling for such a fine job. Thanks Gili!< /text>

Great counter help. All automated but my Google Pay phone didn't work had to break out the card:(.   Changed my own air filter and even that was a bit hard for the old guy to get the spring clips to relatch :) Now for the online survey and a chance to win a drawing. Good luck?< /review>

I went in the other day because my truck was losing power and the check engine light had come on. They let me borrow a code reader to determine that it was a cylinder 1 misfire and multiple misfires. Tran confirmed my thought that it was probably spark plugs. He got me set up with platinum plugs that are pregapped and a small packet of anti-seize thread lube. I was able to do the job myself thanks to a handy YouTube video and my truck is running great!< /text>

I've been a customer at O'Reilly's for 30+ years but I had the worst experience coming to this location today!
I went in for oil for my car and the type of oil I needed was on sale but it was out of stock I asked the employee if they can match the sale price to one of the other cheaper brands he said NO!... I asked him to ask a manager.
The manager said yes.. go ahead! When the employee brought the item up to the counter the manager changed his mind and said we can go halfway in the middle.
I told him that that was rude because he had just said that he would match it but then changed his mind at the last minute...he said "well whatever that's what it is".
I told the employee to just go ahead and ring me up but then I saw that he rang me up at full price for both on my credit card.
I told him well that isn't half off! The employee looked at the manager and the manager said oh I thought you said just ring it up meaning at regular price... I said oh so now you're going back on the halfway price too?
He shrugged his shoulders and said well you said ring it up.
The manager shrugged his shoulders again as if it is what it is...take it or leave it and I said forget it I'll go to another location.
I told the manager that that wasn't good business practice to offer something and then go back on his word and to act like a jerk about it.
The manager acted very rude and unprofessional with me and just didn't care!
I asked for the district manager name and number.</review>

I go to O'Reillys at least 5times a week easy. Around the city not just here. Kevin is very helpful and knowledgeable. I have received good customer service every time I come in. I see people get upset when they can't explain what they need to the employees, bare in mind they are not mind readers and they do the best they can with the INFORMATION  YOU give them. For those who don't know cars ask them questions they will guide you in the right direction. Good staff at this location.<//Text>

They always do their best to help me out I didn't know If you have to use a loaner tool say for something that isnt really a time consuming job they will let you use it in their parking lot just let them hold your License and you don't have to buy it and return it like other parts suppliers A...zone.  In my case I needed a special tool to install an O2 sensor a while back I really didnt have the extra cash to buy the tool  besides the fact that it took me 3 minutes to install the sensor and the tool really doesn't get used again...</review>

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. GO TO CONVOY ORREILLYS. These are the type of people where you go to them for help and they act like you're trying to take something from them. I brought in a battery and had an employee and the manager both tell me I had a 1 year warranty, when in fact I had a 2 year warranty. I guess they didnt even bother looking at the battery..... took it to Convoy and got it sorted out by people who actually care.<//text>

One O'Reilly is about the same as another as it is a Auto chain-store. I shop at AutoZone Napa and others once in awhile. What I really like about O'Reilly's is that they keep track of stuff in the computer for years one time I bought calipers for the front brakes on my car but I didn't install them for about 5 years until I finally got around to changing the pads at that time I had misplaced my receipts with the core charge which was around $50 I was amazed at O'Reilly was able to look it up and find it in the computer and refund me the core charge. The second thing I like is some of the new tools and other products that I see appear on the Shelf from time to time. At this particular location it's not too busy which I like since I don't have to wait 15 minutes in line like I have at other visits both here and AutoZone and the store is clean not much else I can say.<//text>

This is located in the heart of Highland Park. I went here during the infamous COVID-19 lock-down. There was no line and no customers besides me. There was plenty of stock, including toilet paper.

It had plenty of parking. There's a meat section. Price was reasonable.< /review>

Staff are nice and friendly. The meat is always fresh! The Beef fajitas, milanesa de pollo and the ceviche are my fave!
On the weeknds they offer cooked food like Carnitas and menudo. If you love avocado 🥑 trust me, they are always on point and so delicious!
I just love this place 🛒<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Been going here for over 25 years. This place is way awesome. Mexican candy, decent prices on meat and veggies. Great beer and liquor selections. Other businesses should follow this model.</Text>

Inside a Mitsuwa Marketplace. Had to fall in line to get in, but the line moved quick. I appreciate the safety measures.
Store is well organized, making it easy to find what you're looking for. The store also had a huge inventory of pens and markers and drawing/art utensils and cute notepads and bags and just all sorts of stuff!<//text>

< Review>
I've loved the Kinokuniya bookstore in Little Tokyo for years. This was my first foray to this one and I love it just as much. FYI: it's located inside the Mitsuwa Marketplace, so when you see that, you're headed in the right direction. I'm a pen junkie, and Kinokuniya has everything I could ever want. I've learned that the Japanese really love their writing implements and are great at developing all types of pens for optimum writing experience. Of course there's manga aplenty, along with tons of awesome blank books, journals, stationery, plushies, cute tote bags (check out the Gojira/Godzilla one). The sales staff are really friendly too. Definitely worth a second and third trip. Plus, right next door is a market specializing in all Japanese food and sundry items, including fresh sushi to go, as well as shops with all manner of Japanese fast food. Shop then eat. Sounds like a plan.</Review>

<Time>1606305240033</Time><Rating>4<//Rating><review>You can just feel the history of the place seeping out of the woodwork. It might not be some library that's been around for centuries, but even in it's few decades of existence, a lot of influential writers have browsed these same bookshelves, just with different books in their time. And many of their works are now on those shelves today.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>This is the best possible place to end up in after a stroll in Chinatown. I love the shelves that are orderly but not rigidly parallel to each other, and the staff picks are great recs too. One of my favorite bookstores in the city.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

It will be on the right side of the entrace. It's very small and have a lot of stationary. I actually came all the way here to pick up an order since none of the staff in LT offered to even order an item I was looking for nor did I even know that was possible so I was thankful to the lady who helped me.</text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Had an appointment yesterday and from the moment I was called to get my routine eyes check I got treated like royalty. They explain everything that was going to be done without rushing it. Ask me if I had any questions and when I did have a few questions it was answered to my satisfaction. Oh I really like when your appointment is over, they don’t leave you in the room by yourself and just leave like they don’t know you no more. They walk you out like a good friend or family member would do after you visited. I would highly recommend coming here to get your eyes taken care of.< /Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Newsome is by far the best optometrist we have ever visited.  He has a warm and caring demeanor and is very attentive to his patients.  He listened, addressed all of our questions and concerns, and he was very thorough in his exam.  The office is inviting, and the office staff are absolutely wonderful.  The whole process from start to finish was easy.  Dr. Newsome has provided the best, most precise vision correction for us for over ten years.  I would absolutely recommend him to anyone needing optometry services.<//Review>

What I love is the patience with my 5yr old and the genuine conversation with my teen, on how is she doing as well.

My experience was very calming and comfortable. Everyone there is very nice and they truly care about people. For anyone looking for a very kindhearted, caring, funny, good with children and teens, Optometrist and Staff, this is the place to go!</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This was my first visit with Dr. Newsome since my regular optometrist has retired and I must say that Dr. Nishio has left his patients in great hands. Dr. Newsome is easy to talk with, warm personality and  I had a pleasurable experience. There is no major issues with my vision, so I am happy. Thank you Dr, Newsome and staff.</Review>

I found the entire process from making my appointment, to seeing the doctor, to picking out glasses/contacts was not only easy but pleasant as well.  All of the staff were extremely helpful, kind, and knowledgeable.  I never felt rushed or ignored by any of the staff or doctor when I had questions. I highly recommend Dr. Newsome  and his practice to anyone!!!! Thank you all 😊<//Review><Name>Raymond Stabenfeldt<//Name>< Rate>

One of the best experiences  I  have had would recommend  them to everybody they take the time to go over everything  and  don't force anything on you and for a guy with horrible  fashion  sense  they are  very  good  at helping  you  pick out glasses  that  fit your style.< /text>

Dr. Newsome has excellent bedside manner.  I felt like he really cared about helping me to see better.  Not in a “here are some glasses” kind of way, but more about eye health.  I wish I had a better way to explain it.  I’ve been to the flashy eye doctor “groups” and in the end I just felt like I was paying extra for fancy gizmos while they peddled expensive treatments.

Dr. Newsome isn’t like this at all, and he is knowledgeable about state of the art treatment.

Oh, and the office staff!  They were super nice.</Text>

The eye exam has always been on point in the 4 years that I have been going to this local.  I liked there selection of glasses as well but they made a change this year and I may not be using my prescription here next time.   I think most people will find something they love here but I'm kind of picky.  I will continue to go here for prescription because they are very accurate unlike other places I've been to  They changed the brands hat they carry and I'm disappointed that they no longer carry Michael Kors or Valentino. The brands they still carry are Gucci, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture,  Miu Miu, Vera Wang, and my favorite Dior to name a few.< /Text>

Dr. Newsome is the best! I've been going to him for years and I've gotten the best service. The ladies that work there are very friendly and make an effort to get to know you (as well as Dr. Newsome). I had a corneal ulcer a few years ago and Dr. Newsome took immediate action. I truly felt like he cared about my well-being and making sure there wasn't further damage. He makes you feel comfortable and explains what he's doing. I've had a few other eye issues and I was well taken care of here.< /review>

So cute! I had no idea this was here. Mini walking trails under the trees plus open green grass. Dogs okay on leash. Lots of benches. Seems pretty low traffic. Came on Saturday and not many people.<//Text>

I want to give this park 5 stars but the lack of facilities is what drops the star. Play area is great. The location is phenomenal. Just not being able to run your toddler to the bathroom is hard, but workable. Starbucks is right up the way.<//Text>

Small park with modern play equipment and plenty of space for pets and children to run around.  Only downside is during school days after school lets out, the older kids usually congregate at the park , play on the equipment meant for children, leave behind trash and sometimes fight with each other.<//Text>

Hoyt Park has a good playground and a nice field but it has no public restroom. This park would be vastly improved with a restroom. There are no organized sports allowed in the field but people can play around in the field.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Dining at Nova was such a great experience! The service was immaculate with attentiveness at the table along with being served with haste but poise.

The dishes were perfectly proportioned for the party and delicate. We paired our food with their cocktails that I can’t give more kudos for. They were so good and I highly recommend ordering one or two along with your meal.

Great job to everyone at Nova! Thank you for a great night of dining!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOOOFbYqMURHYMoRn4jWoy84YCRJ-tPwRRlwwh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dcd7ae6b263069:0x3f1a3c8d7af74fa2< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I amazed by their appearance as they have so many sittings inside and outside. The restaurant is very clean and they follow Covid-19 safety procedure.

For the food, I think it’s very good but only 1 problem is that the portion is kinda small and it’s a little bit pricey. The xiao long bao skin is kind of thick in my opinion and the sashimi portion is not fair compared to its price ($9 for 3 thin pieces).

Overall, if you want to eat in a nice and fancy restaurant, this place is for you.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBl8PwDg7LYREEZe8QkW33DCMhjzVXapvIq2-a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfHHUQJHI2S9JK3T7W6ThoDwFlVX-P4qoUvDkK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpmkr6AkPur27xOcEUcV_WUFdJxabip5t9ZgRA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfbELaFi4cNce5s8KWAeYAx-IFGHucQfc0Jkr3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOc3Pj0u7OK0pBaPubV9oigb5_KJtuOnwfP9v4T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLwOeY5JiAgmytCCxfPtaLL4hdWcBhgUeNT70b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx_-i1R0KAIvCEDXquQJWEOrCfM6mJ_icC9zAW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-IQwYAR4kSe5A6wKTo_j2rokiZHA1yuBzh_Z2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_x1EsMUDi0m2Hw7IOoYXMVLWduPbZ98-oMk4g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3d8JkcietqIo-xpdLP4iLuqKU-n6r4tBym74Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF7C21O7FnZRmEU7H1yEzixvA1F2cNhSmuyj09=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuZB1AR9jjVsGfpfwcXY7DJ7rD_lMc8PaNYkZU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4i-74LK1e98Wi4o4qjHDLabcy9kmTdTyNwbmf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9lVwfLd7sOLupz5Q8b56MgpMmmI5hTKpUpRA4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYyMaMO1pslOy_kfTIMyclS-B30_6ni832G6Hx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe4ibT9nNQ3wQb2VMtjkaYLEHD46O7AWlaBENO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMPmhMhhKTfrYEnZJgfRcJx3bcdoor_omy2rqx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

The ambiance of the place is definitely good, the waitress was friendly and pleasant. The food took a very long time to arrive, the food itself wasn't the greatest, it is a fusion food place so I wasn't expecting authentic asian flavor but for me they are are not bringing something new, the flavor wasn't the best. I may come back because I didn't hate it but not any time soon.< /Review>

<Review>I don't normally give 5 stars, because even if a place is good I always feel there is room for improvement.  Nova Kitchen did not disappoint.  Their food was really tasty and the wagyu ribeye was cooked just the way I ordered it. Medium rare. We usually leave with left overs but we finished all our food. I would definitely recommend you try it for yourself. We also enjoyed the teriyaki chicken, volcano roll, seafood rice, and deep fried avocado green salad. All of which was very satisfying. The personnel were all very friendly and happy to have us there. The atmosphere was great as well, with modern flare. Nova Kitchen I am happy to give you 5 stars. Enjoy friends.<//Review>< username>

<review>Stopped in for dinner on a Saturday night. The first thing I noticed is there was plenty of parking adjacent to the restaurant. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated with an updated modern artistic decor. It creates a nice atmosphere to dine. Abby was our host and she set us up at a nice table facing the bar she was very pleasant,  friendly and professional. Laura our waiter was kind and took great care of us she made us feel welcomed. The food was excellent. We enjoyed everything we tried.

Shishito peppers (not spicy at all, need a little kick & less salt) shrimp tempura (wasn't the traditional tempura, but still good). Brussel sprouts fried rice (really good, recommended. I didn't get to eat much because my boyfriend ate it all). Kung pao chicken, not picture because he already digged in. Not my kind of dish but every man's simple dish is rice and chicken ( not sure why). Korean BBQ rib, small portion wish I had more, I didn't really enjoy much without picking out burtns pieces. It's family style menu yet the decor is so upscale. Prices are a little more than the portion. Overall this was a good experience and we will return. Maybe try a happy hr visit at their beautiful bar. Highly recommend this place. Try it and write your own review they will give you mochi as a compliment, but be honest about.

< Review>
True to our promise last month, we returned to NOVA for a truly outstanding dinner. Each dish was pure perfection. From the Miso Soup to the Garlic Edamame, to the Crunchy Tempura Corn and the succulent, Crisp Shrimp and Sushi, preparation, presentation and service were all beyond compare.< /Review>

BEST experience. Due to COVID, we hadn't been out for a while, and since yesterday was a very special occasion, we decided to come to NOVA; I'm so happy we did! Not only was the ambiance luxurious, but the service is also up to par. I ordered the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi and it was delicious! We will definitely come back</Text>

Great food with fresh flavors and a great atmosphere. Everything we ordered was spot-on, but the marinated pork and the seafood fried rice are definitely on a list to repeat in the future. We were not in a hurry, but the slow speed of service is the only thing preventing 5 stars. The server we had was very friendly and had great menu insights.<//text>

Me and my fiance go out for a date night after we both had our covid vaccine shots.  We pick Nova because they has a very nice outside dining and not just a tent or tables on a sidewalk.  We was surprised that they offered indoor dining room as well.
The place was beautiful, clean and well decorate.  The servers was very considerate.  We order red wines, for food we got yellowtail sashimi, uni sushi, salmon lemon roll, vegetable fried rice and for desert we got mochi.
All was so fresh and delicious.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone and will come back to visit more in future.
To Nova: You are my favorite place to go! please keep doing what you are doing!<//Text>

<text>I went to Nova Kitchen & Bar for takeout during OC Restaurant Week and seeing it featured on Yelp's Top 100 places for 2021! Glad I did and hope to stop by to eat indoors in the post-pandemic era where things are safer.

Something to note that's a wee bit confusing right off the bat - you'll most likely have to park in the hotel parking lot (which is right across from the restaurant). Bring your parking ticket with you as Nova Kitchen will validate even for takeout.

When I got there, it looked super fancy inside (so definitely curious to further explore in the future). I was greeted by a friendly hostess who took my credit card and confirmed my order. Everything was great. The process did take a bit longer than expected since they had to run the card at the bar in the back versus having a credit card reader in the front (and there were issues that night with the machine), but overall, it was a pretty smooth process.

+Pork Belly Bun: Super delicious. Although most of what they did here with their iteration was pretty on par with other pork belly buns, I love that they had some spice to it with the peppers and the presentation even in a to go box was great.
+Miso Cod: The miso cod was also solid. Another really beautiful dish even to go. The sauce is flavorful and love the colors that pop. The fish is cooked solidly here too.
+Strawberry Panna Cotta: Funny enough, the least good looking dish of the group although it tasted great. I imagine this is because they had to separate the panna cotta from the sorbet and thus, the to go solution leaves the panna cotta in its own box and a bit lackluster. However, put them together and the taste is wonderful. Love that the panna cotta isn't overly sweet and that the sorbet has little rock popping candy to give you those childhood memories.<//text><Date>1615658420956</Date>< userid>

This restaurant is absolutely beautiful, with mediocre food. None of the food was bad but nothing was great. Given the price of the food, I expected more.

Note that every dish is sold separately; Entree, side dishes.

I went on a Saturday night between 7:30 & 9:30. It was mostly empty.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Time>

<Review>God this place is basically perfect.  They get you in and out, but the atmosphere is well designed, so you don't feel like you're in a Chipotle.  The food is almost exclusively hand rolls, and they're the same delicious rolls from Sugarfish.  While I think the value is really good, I always order too much because I'm a pig and that ends up being expensive.  But when I eat like a normal person, you can get an amazing meal for under $20.<//Review><user_id>110562131767944559607< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place had me entertained! It’s a club turned restaurant/event space, and truly I wish it was still a dance club! There is a floor to ceiling TV screen that was oddly playing sports. Really out of place here. The menu was designed eclectically with different element themes matching each of the restaurant’s rooms -water, earth, fire, air. We joked that maybe we would rotate to the appropriate room corresponding to our next entree!

The food is good, however. It was just such a waste to have such an awesome place be just a restaurant. I had the unagi roll and my coworker had the salmon lemon roll. Both were very good and fresh. We also shared shishito peppers! Dinnerware was also very upscale and unique. They have actual chopsticks (not wooden ones wrapped in paper).

Our waiter was super nice and gave us a tour of the space after our meal. There is a special hidden room you can rent for a steep price to sing karaoke. And the bathrooms were really cool- the men’s room was Tiffany’s themed and the women’s room had a lip chair and lots of glitter.<//review>< Pictures>

We were pretty impressed with the food and drinks. Usually I'm suspicious of "fusion" spots, but they nailed it. Swanky place with good food and cool drinks.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I found this restaurant on yelp and saw all the amazing reviews and decided to try it last night. Unfortunately there were two huge events last night, but the male manager with the glasses offered us a table secluded from the parties. That was extremely kind and excited to try this place out!

The food was great! We ordered the Dan dan noodles and 5 element dumpling! Both dishes were fantastic and full of flavor. We ordered some mixed drinks and they came the way we love it! Strong!

I have to say this place is so over the top, I love it. So much to look at it and the decor is just one of a kind. We will be returning.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Terrific food and a great dining experience.  The menu was so unique I just asked Brandon our server for his recommendations. He got my tastes matched perfectly and diner was exceptional. Brandon noticed we were curious about the different rooms in the restaurant as we walked out and gave us a tour of the various rooms... I highly recommend</text>

What a great choice. We were greeted with open arms and lovely smiles even wishing us happy anniversary! Absolutely amazing service.

Our waitress Mercedes greeted us happy anniversary, how does everyone know? I love it. We ordered the miso cod: so flavorful, generous portion. Salmon jalapeño roll: fresh and tasty. Korean short ribs: tastes like straight from Korea! Basically all the food was amazing. Such a great night.

We thought the night was over, but then the General Manager stopped by with chocolate cake wishing us a happy anniversary. This was the best anniversary ever. Thank you to all that made this night special for us.

We will be back!<//review><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Tiny portions and high prices.  The food is fine but you'll leave hungry.  The service was unacceptable.  There was a 30 minute gap between the arrival of the first entree and the last.  I would have cancelled my order had I been able to get my server's attention.< /review>

<Review>Overpriced food. Not that good for what it is. Would probably give this restaurant 2 stars at best if I wasn't overcharged. Service was decent except for the fact that they forgot some of our drink orders multiple times throughout the meal.

When the bill came for our large party, we were told we had to automatically pay 22% tip. Usually restaurants inform you ahead of time but we were not told anything about this. Fine, whatever.

Then after that, I was overcharged by $200 on our $500 tab. It took me 1 month of calling the restaurant EVERY SINGLE NIGHT nonstop before the manager even responded to me. They supposedly took down my number a couple times but I never received a call which is why I kept having to call. When the manager finally spoke with me, he said he will file a claim with the company that does their billing and he will CC me in the email that same night. I call the next day and say I never received anything and he rudely responds with "things don't happen in a blink of an eye". Sure but it's been more than a "blink of an eye" and it has been a whole month and you also said yourself you would do it the night before.

Instead, I just decided to file a claim with my credit card company instead of wasting my time continuing to call the restaurant to be put on hold every day. Their restaurant is not even that busy, it was 90% empty when we were there on a Friday night.</Review>< Rating>

Our 1st server was horribly unattentive, we were about to leave when another server stepped in to save it. Food was good.. Expensive. The three of us hit $200.00 in no time and were still nowhere near full. We left and went for tacos after.</Review></record>

< review>
Words cannot express my overwhelming appreciation for the staff at Nova. Is it not the people who make the difference in your dining?! It’s the company, fellowship, compassion and kindness above what you are tasting on your plate.  I would be remised if I didn’t mention how excellent the food is! Nova convinced me that brussel sprouts can be tasty! But it’s my experience there that left the lasting impression.
My cousins set up a birthday celebration for my milestone 40.  I really wasn’t excited to celebrate but my first interaction was with Brandon the bar tender, (you can’t miss him because he has a fantastic Mohawk and a warm disposition) and he poured me a generous tasting and kept me company while my family arrived.  The ambiance is trendy and warm. We had a great table where Yvette our server (can’t miss her, she too is warm and beautiful) went above and beyond to make my birthday extra special.
Behind every great staff is a great manager and I have to say I have never met any other like Joseph Gebhardt (Jo) who blessed my expletive so.  He made me feel like a celebrity and added so much to my celebration.
Thank you so much Nova staff for such excellent service.  You were like family instead of staff. I can’t wait to come back
Love, Christa<//review>

Probability it has fantastic food. Menu looks great. Great location and beautiful restaurant but Gluten Free is not  an option. That’s the reason of my 3 ⭐️ scoring. Not even GF soya. They can do better I think.<//text>

<Review>Generously giving two stars because the ambiance is great and the restaurant is very clean and modern. I came in a party of 4 at 8:00 pm on a Friday, and the place was pretty much empty.

Besides the ambiance, I can't give this place any props... the food was not great. Small portions, either salty or bland, and just wasn't doing it for me.

We ordered:
- seafood fried rice
- corn tempura
- 5 element dumplings
- pork ribs
- kung pao chicken
- salmon lemon roll
- toro nigiri
- yellowtail belly nigiri

And the only thing that tasted decent was the dumplings.

We definitely feel like we can get our money's worth elsewhere... Do not recommend.</Review><Rating>2< /Rating>< Date>

Wonderful atmosphere.  The restaurant is beautiful and extremely welcoming.  The staff were very attentive.  Food was delicous and had exciting savory flavors.  The wagu beef dishes were tender and full of flavor. An excellent trio of mushrooms accompany one of the wagu dishes.  Tempura shrimp were perfect with a Doc Holliday cocktail.  I will surely visit this establishment again and again.    Ten stars!<//text>

Great company to work with.  Explained available options. Prices were right. Salesman and window technician were always on time.  Office follow ups were helpful.  Albert was the person who who came out for the window measurements.  Same professionalism as salesman. Waiting for installation.  Everything up to this point has been very smooth.</Text>

Excellent outcome with extra special service from Jessie, Jason, and Andrew. AVW did 8 of my windows, including a garden window.  This is a company that stands behind its work, and has been a pleasure to work with their people.  I researched a number of replacement window companies, and decided upon AVW and I am so glad I used them. Workmanship is top notch!</text>

Albert was the Measure Tech who came to my house today and was very professional. He was very efficient and did not waste any time. He also found some errors in the first estimate which I’m glad he caught and fixed this time. He explained everything in detail and made me feel at ease.< /Review>

American Vision in Orange is just awesome! Craig was great to work with and installers Jim, Corey, Rigo and Enrique were professional and provided excellent service. I have a ranch style house with original windows from 1964. Craig created a great design with crank windows on the side to replace a large window in the living room. The install was great and painless. the project came our amazing. I would highly recommend these guys if you are looking for quality Anlin windows with all-around great service.< /Text>

Our windows will be installed in a few weeks.  So far, we have received excellent service by both Peter and Albert in the process of learning everything about the new retrofit windows. The information presented to us was thorough and all our questions have been answered.  Our window openings have been measured twice, by both Peter and Albert, to make sure the order is placed correctly.  We are looking forward to a successful installation and will post another review at that time.

We love our new Anlin Sun Matrix windows and patio door! They were installed last week by the crew at American Vision Windows!  The installation could have taken place sooner, but we had to ask them for a later date due to our vacation. They were not inconvenienced at all by our request.  My husband was home during the installation with seven installers, including Octavio, Corey, Bob, Jose, Romero, and Vince. They arrived by 8:30 a.m. and were finished before 2:00 p.m.  Afterwards, they waited outside for a while and we thought they were regrouping before taking off for the day.  Instead, the Supervisor arrived!  He walked around with my husband to inspect every component of each window and the patio door.  The Supervisor asked the installers to make a few minor adjustments here and there.  Needless to say, we were very impressed with this level of service. We highly recommend American Vision Windows!</text>

<Text>Octavio and Edgar did a fantastic job installing our 4 replacement windows and our replacement sliding glass door!  Their professionalism really shows in the quality of their finished work.  The exterior framing is clean and beautiful to see.  Makes the windows very visually appealing.  The windows make every room inside the house appear to be bigger with all of the light they bring in.  Octavio and Edgar did an excellent job installing everything, we are extremely pleased with the pride they showed in their workmanship and attention to all details.  They completely cleaned every area they worked in.  They worked very hard, were completely professional, and did an amazing job!  We could not be happier with their work.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1609445013385, 'text': 'John - we kindly thank you for the 5 star review!

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!  Unprofessional doesn't even begin to describe them.  We ordered windows in October for December installation.  Install got pushed back to January and finally February.  Now the installers are on site and 1 of the 4 windows is "missing".  It was backordered.  No one called us to let us know what was going on, the installers were unable to get a hold of anyone.  What a JOKE of a company.</Text>

I retained American Vision last year to install a Kohler walk-in bath in my elderly parents' home which required taking down an exterior wall and reinstalling a bay window.  We also had them replace an existing glass sliding door.  American Vision's window/door crew was outstanding. Unfortunately, the subcontractor used to install the Kohler tub was not.  One year later, I was very happy to learn that American Vision is now using their own crews to install these baths.  I called them because the tub was not draining and the stop was not staying opened.  I was so impressed with Ken, the technician who solved the entire problem by figuring out the exact height required for the drain stop to allow it to drain perfectly.  My poor mother had waited one year to take a bath and was only using the shower head as the tub would not drain.  Ken was meticulous and took immense pride in solving our issue.  It was a joy to call American Vision and have them respond as quickly as they did.  Now that they are doing all of the work for Kohler bath installations, I would highly recommend them.  Their window/door work is impeccable.  Thank you, Ken!< /text>

My husband and I had previously used American Vision Windows to install two front windows and an upstairs bedroom window last year.  We were so happy with the experience we decided to get the rest of the windows in the house done as well as the three sliding glass doors.  Since we were going to have all the openings in the house covered, we also decided it would be the time to replace the huge old entry door and sidelights we had with a nice new double door with windows.

We called up Peter, who had sold us the last set of windows, and he came out a few times to walk us through all of our options for the sliders and to make sure the new windows would be the same as the ones we previously had AVW install.  Same as before, Peter was awesome and extremely helpful in working with our budget.

When it came time for measuring, the AVW representative that came to the house was super helpful and even made a special note to our kitchen window as the existing window was going to pose a challenge to retrofit.  We were a little nervous when this was pointed out to us, but he told us that they can handle just about anything and they would make the finished product look right.

Fast forwarding a few months, we got the call for the install and were super happy.  Jason had called us to schedule and then followed up with us two days prior to make sure everything was good to go and if we had any questions.

When install day came, we were told the crew would be at our house between 8:30 am and 9:30 am.  8:00 am on the dot we have the two crews, one for the windows and one for the door, show up and they were ready to go!  They introduced themselves and walked my husband through the order while the rest of the team started setting up.

No joke, the windows and sliders were demoed in about an hour!  They worked super fast and clean, which was nice since it was going to be enough of a challenge putting back the furniture and window treatments later.  Everyone on the window install team was super nice: Jesse, Miguel, Juan, and Steve were very friendly and did a great job.  It was interesting how fast the windows went in and then how much time and care was taken to insulate the gaps, install the molding, and get the windows in show room condition.  The windows and sliders were amazing!  We couldn't believe this was our house!  The window crew was done about 2:30 pm, which was hard to believe that they were able to knock everything out in that amount of time.  The final walkthrough was such a treat, with the challenging kitchen window turning out perfect with a great stucco patch to fix the unsightly gap in the old window.  Total pros!!

The door crew also did an amazing job and wow, that door really made a difference.  Henry and Carlos were great, making the needed adjustments to the opening to get the door in there just right.  Being a double door, we were very sensitive to how the door lined up and how the hardware worked.  When we tried out the door with Henry, everything was nice and snug with the hardware working absolutely perfect.  No more misaligned deadbolt where we had to wiggle the door to get it to set.  No more old heavy wood door!  This was amazing.  Henry was even nice enough to stay behind and quickly re-key the hardware to our existing keys so we could save a trip back to Home Depot to make new keys.  Henry even installed our smart deadbolt and made it look easy.  Everything is working flawlessly!

This was another great experience with American Vision Windows.  We couldn't be happier with everyone we encountered along the way.  The windows, sliders, and entry door have done an amazing job in transforming the look of our house!  We are looking forward to actually being able to open our windows to enjoy the breeze, having sliders that actually slide (imagine that!), and an entry door that is a welcoming focal point to our house.  I can't thank the team enough!!  GREAT JOB!!

We have needed windows for about 15 years. Called several companies for quotes. Jesse came out for a quote and did a great job demonstrating windows and explaining the process.  Juan came out to complete the final measurements. Both were very professional and helpful. American vision was not the lowest bid but the quality of windows and professional employees swayed us to go with them.  You will definitely get your money's worth.< /Text>

<Review>We had all of our windows and sliders replaced on Tuesday, 1/5/21 and we are absolutely satisfied.  Our Sales Rep was Craig.  He was very thorough and professional.  He answered questions before we even asked them.  He brought large samples and a heat lamp to demonstrate how the windows would function in direct sunlight.  Albert came to do the measuring.  He explained how the windows would be installed and the timelines for manufacturing and installation.  Jim, Milton and their crew did our installation.  They showed up right on time, wore their masks the entire time and were very courteous.  They worked efficiently and treated our house with respect.  They were done in under 6 hours.  Bottom line, AVW has beautiful, quality windows and doors at a great price with wonderful, professional employees and excellent customer service.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Go anywhere else. I’m extremely disappointed with my experience with American Vision Windows.  I came to them because of all the great reviews, but my experience with them since signing the sales contract has been anything but great. They came to our Home in July and did a great presentation. We were wow’d by their windows and their responsiveness. We signed the contract and we’re told our window installation would occur within 8-10 weeks. Based on the sales pitch we expected our window install to occur around by the end of September.  Here we are entering into November and no installation date in sight.  For the last 6 weeks their customer service has been deplorable.  My husband and I have made over 20 attempts to reach out to our project manager and the installation department. We’ve left voice messages and have sent texts. Other than one text early on saying “I’ll look into it,” there has been complete radio silence. After so much frustration, I called the office.  I explained my concerns and that based on their lack of help we wanted to cancel our contract and give our money to a more responsive company. I was assured the matter would be looked in to and they they would reach out ASAP. That was 3 weeks ago and not a peep from them. This is so disappointing from a company that had such great reviews.  Now we are out money, no windows, and have zero confidence in this company.< /review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

I was recommended to American Vision Windows through another contractor that was working on my house. He said he had a great experience with the company, and I figured if it was good enough for a contractor I should definitely check it out.

I was able to chat with someone through the website immediately. They took my info and called me back the next day. Peter reached out to me and set up a time to visit my house and walk me through everything.

The visit was great and really was helpful in understanding the difference in Windows and features. My kids loved the demo with the heat lamp, it was fun.

Albert followed up with the fine measuring and was very helpful in explaining next steps and getting everything lined up.

I’ll update my review after install but for now I couldn’t be happier with how the process has gone. Very simple and straightforward. Thank you Peter and Albert for starting me off right!</text>

Jesse worked great with us on our windows and french doors. He answered all our questions and called/texted me promptly each time I needed to make adjustments to the quote/contract. He was very patient and helpful.

Albert came out for the technical measurements and was very experienced. He completely explained all of our options based on the windows/french doors we ordered. He helped us get very accurate sizing measurements for our new windows/doors. Thanks Albert!<//text>

Do not sign a contract for new windows without 1st researching this company.  I almost made a BIG mistake and signed with one of their competitors.  I changed my mind after Craig came out to give me a free estimate.  He spent as much time as needed to make sure I fully understood all windows are NOT the same and worked very hard to make the deal work.  American Vision Windows has the highest quality windows, the best installers, and the best warranty.  Look no further!
They are the superior providers of your window needs.  Their sales representative was very informative and not pushy.  Within a few days of making my decision Albert came out to remeasure my windows.  He too was very professional and very informative.  He measured every window from the inside and out and clearly explained what to expect on installation day.  Very impressed.  Excellent customer service.< /Text>

All the windows have been installed improperly and really I was terrified of getting quotes for new windows.  Not only did Jack show me the different vendors and windows, broke down costs and also mindful of my financial situation, but I was able to select the badly needed replacements right now.  Even though I can't do all my windows now, I'm doing three which I can afford thru installments.  Genuine good guy that's going to give it to you truthfully.  Everyone I have spoken to or met with at AVW have been great.  I pray it continues through the install.  Will keep you informed!</Text><rate>5< /rate>< resp>

<text>American Vision Windows responded to my "slider window" problem.  Jack the Sales Staff Member, was on time and provided options for restoring my windows.  Albert the Exact Measurement Staff Member was prompt and took measurements and had samples of the vinyl window frame.  Both staff members observed all safety protocols.  Both staff members were friendly and very knowledgeable.  I will recommend American Vision Windows.  The windows are ordered and I will update my review after completed.</text>< userid>

This review is for RFQ and Window measurement portions. Will update later with actual window installation job.

We were assigned Josh for our window / sliding & french door RFQ. He was able to accommodate our time in the evening to meet with us. He was able to provide succinct answers to our questions. For the most part, nothing was confusing, and if it was, again, we were able to get our answer. After a few weeks we were able to select American Vision out of four other bids to work on our project. Once again, Josh was able to accommodate our busy schedule and meet us in the evening to complete the paperwork. He also came with booties and a mask.

For the measurement portion, Albert came out about a week or so later to get final measurements. He also came with booties and a mask. He answered some questions relating to the outside trim and how it would work installing the frame on the outside. What would be covered up, etc. He finished up the measurement and filled me in on final details. Now we're set for the window installation.

The only bad thing I can say is that the lead-time for the actual windows is way out there since everyone seems to be installing new windows these days (what we heard from American and the other contractors). We'll just have to be patient.

***4/26/21 Update***: Just wanted to give a shout out to American Vision Windows for taking care of us. Windows were installed and look great. We did run into some issues with the roof and window type - but we were very satisfied with how Mike handled the situation. If we have any window projects in the future, we'd definitely give AVW a look again.< /text>

I picked this company out of 6 estimates based on their reviews. I wasn’t very happy with the initial start up. After signing and making the down payment,  I finally had to call the office myself to schedule the formal measurement. But then Albert came out to measure, explained the process and showed me samples of trim and things that were not shown to me during the sales process. He was helpful and knowledgeable and I felt better about my decision. Fingers crossed!<//text>

I had to post a review... Albert showed up 10 minutes early, very professional and friendly.  He explained the job and what would be done in an easy to understand format. Very genuine, asked about my kids, etc making small talk. Spoke highly of the company, its people, top level management, and departments which made me feel more at ease after his intuition- picked up some concerns I had with moving forward and what the warranty covers.  Mike Jackson (general manager) also got involved early on b/c of a minor issue with pricing and honored the original price and went out of his way to earn my business. How often do you see that???  Hopefully the install goes just as well as what Albert and Mike took care of. Highly recommend this company.<//review>

I like everything about this business! We needed a walk-in tub and found the perfect one for us at American Vision Windows and Baths. Working with them was a dream. No hitches...well except that the pandemic delayed our installation. But once we were all on the same page and ready to go, our new Kohler tub was installed beautifully, professionally in one day and we are thrilled with it. I was hesitant to get a walk-in tub because I thought it would have a hospital look. But once I saw the clean lines and great Kohler workmanship I was sold.  This tub fits beautifully in our bath. I am happy to recommend American Vision  Windows and Baths.<//Text>

Anlin windows are looking so good, nice and new. Henry and Enrique did such a real quick and clean job on taking off the old framing and installing the new windows. They were on the job on time and were ready to work on a Saturday morning. They laid down drop cloths so my floors and carpeting were not damaged and the cleanup was done with ease.
I’m so happy with the workers quality workmanship and made the finish job look so good. Thank you so much for David’s caring and the measures done by Arturo were so accurate!
I won’t hesitate to use this company again. Thank you for a job well done!< /Text>

<review>We had our bathtub converted to a Beautiful walking shower that we absolutely love. Our salesman was Craig and he was outstanding in all aspects of presenting the plan. We are Very absolutely impressed with both Craig and the installer. And because of the quality work American Vision Windows did, that we just met with Craig again and are having our current garden window replaced with a new Garden Window. We Will have Craig and American Vision Windows also replace all our windows at a time in the future. Totally Impressed and Happy! If you want Quality, have Craig and American Vision Windows do your job.<//review>< user_name>

This is our second experience with AVW and just like the first time David did a fantastic job of showing us our options and getting us set up for the install. Robert was awesome as well. When he came out to do the measurements, he not only was very thorough but made some great suggestions about a double hung window in the bathroom, that we hadn't even thought about. Great company, highly recommended.<//review>

They arrived on time and didn’t waste any time getting to work. They worked well as a team. I had a couple of questions along the way and they always responded clearly. Only reason I didn’t give them a 5, I thought they could have been a bit more careful with plants close to the windows. My 3 big aloe cactus were just shredded and I had to cut a lot of damaged parts. And one plant by another window they totally crushed and killed. Very replaceable, but still.

Not related to the install team, my understanding with the sales person was that the outside would be stucco ready when done. I took that to include the chicken wire mesh as well. However, they only did the flashing. Contract clearly says flashing only, I took that to mean it would include the mesh. To me, stucco ready means fully stucco ready. My misunderstanding I guess, but disappointed my stucco guy is going to now charge me extra for what I thought was going to be done already.

Overall, though, a good experience and I would recommend American Vision to others.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Date>1584657551687</Date>< Response>

<review>Choosing American Vision Windows is the best decision I have made in years.  Everything about the experience has been amazing.  The sales rep, Jack, explained the entire process in details; he brought samples and explained all the options and products available.  The installers, Henry and Enrique, were professional and efficient.  Their workmanship is beyond our expectation. They worked smoothly, fast and were extremely clean.  The quality of the windows is amazing, as is the cost and lifetime warranty.<//review>< pics>

< review>
I choose the American vision for my sliding door among three companies I tried and got estimate and I decided to chose American vision Despite they were the highest estimate just because the reviews I read . I signed my contract for sliding door for my patio in 10-29-19 the project was finished on 1-13-20 which I consider it too long, I had to call to remind them about scheduling for the measurements, I had to call to remind them for installation they gave me 1-6-20 then I had to argue so they rescheduled it for 12-31-19 they came with wrong size of outside frame so they have to come back with the right size when they finished the job I found out that batching and painting  is not included so I had to hold $800 till I find out is it included it or not and delivered my message to the manger about my compliant , the area or regional manger called me after a week to let me know that painting not included, I made it clear that I knew that but my complaint is about the length of the project and the inconvenience experience I had , his answer is you want me to charge the account I have the remaining balance I said it is a balance and I am not going to hold it but it doesn’t mean I am satisfied or happy he said I will get back to you , still haven’t heard from anyone and he charge the money right away , my conclusion poor communication , the area manger care about the money more than customer service . But to be far the work was good quality</review>

It took time to arrive to the exact specifications we desired for the patterns of our windows.  It was worth all the effort to make sure the shapes were just right, as they turned out even better than one could imagine.  The installation crew that came out was extremely professional, friendly, efficient, and cleaned up afterward leaving as if they'd never been here.  But before they left they had transformed our home with these gorgeous windows and doors!  Thank you American Vision Windows.< /Review>

We are second time customers to American Vision Windows, doing our previous home ten years ago, and had a great experience.  This time was the same.  Josh gave us a super deal as a repeat customer, and recommended some changes.  Albert did the second measurement and was quick and courteous.  He also recommended our kitchen window be tempered glass due to proximity to our front door and added that at no extra charge.  Great customer service!< /text>

<text>I've used American Vision Windows for three jobs now and have been satisfied in the end on every one, though they had to come back on more than one occasion to replace a damaged or defective part. Each installation crew generally includes an experienced installer and a helper. Of the installers I've met, I recommend Henry and Sergio. You can tell they know their craft by the way they work, and both are courteous and professional.</text>< pics>

<Review>After getting estimates from 3 different window companies, we opted to go with AVW. They are thorough and upfront about options available. Albert came out and measured and was able to correct a few mistakes made by the salesperson. He was knowledgeable and friendly and explained the entire process.

UPDATE: I want to add that we had experienced some delays in installation and had some problems getting the windows to pass inspection. However, the customer service we received from Jon Paul DeLaRiva and Sergio Zaragoza was great. They had nothing to do with the issues/problems we had but worked tirelessly to the end to help us remedy the situation.< /Review>< Pics>

I had 11 windows and one double door patio door installed today by American Vision Windows. The job done was excellent. Work crew got here right on time and finished job on time as they had stated. The crew was clean, neat and very professional in their attitude. The crew was very helpful on any questions I had. I would use them again if needed. For American Vision Window's information, the crew members were 4 consisting of:
Henry, Enrique, Corey and Jason. I hope American Vision Windows head office shows this review to the crew members.

<Review>Today Albert came out to measure for my new sliding door from my bedroom to my patio.  He was wonderful.  Very knowledgeable and very through with taking his measurements and telling me about a darker window I could also order.  He was very through with making sure all the papers were signed, all the measurements were correct, and that everything was done so that no one was going to be unhappy about anything.  I would definitely recommend Albert to anyone who needs any window measurements for American Vision.  He was also very friendly and very knowledgeable.<//Review><date>1621818945766</date>< Gmap_id>

In June of this year we had the second half of our residential windows replaced.  We used the same salesman, Peter Stein, as he was accommodating and responsive 5 years earlier.  This time there were some installation challenges.  So much so that the general manager, installation manager (Sergio) and salesman (Peter) all had to meet together at my home to discuss the installation.  With everything arranged I waited for installation day.

Several weeks later, Jesse and his partner arrived for installation.  At this point my house was in the middle of remodel and walls were down to the studs.  Jesse and his partner immediately began their task and were extremely efficient and neat, cleaning up their areas, even though there was a construction mess everywhere.  Installation came out great.

Jesse explained several options to me and guaranteed his return to finish a small portion of the job (yet to be completed).

My experience with everyone at American Vision was top notch.  Each of the people I dealt with were a superb representation of the company.<//Text>

My mom just had her sliding glass door and French door put in today and all she could do was rave about
what a wonderful job Jesse and Miguel did. She said not only did they take pride in the job they were doing,
they did it with smiles on their faces. Jesse was the lead and was so respectful, and did a perfect job.
She said that they left the place cleaner than it was. The doors are beautiful! The only reason I am writing this review is she does not have a google account. The installation went perfect.<//text>

I am super happy with my experience and Albert did an awesome job keeping me informed throughout the process. There was a small issue-and he got back to me same day which I really appreciate. Awesome, awesome, awesome experience so far!!!

UPDATE!
The much awaited install date was today. The crew showed up at 8:30 sharp and got started. Pasquale (not sure if that is spelled correctly), Bob, Cory, and Adam all did a fantastic job. Each installer was courteous, respectful and did a thorough job start to finish. They cleaned up really well and the walk through was completed for both floors. The windows look amazing, but more importantly I can already feel a difference in temperature in the house. I am so happy I went with American Vision Windows. I also had wonderful customer care- Jim reached out to me on the install day to make sure everyone showed up and everything was going well. Super awesome experience- definitely would recommend to anyone.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1558375474337, 'text': "Wow, Cassandra!\n\nThank you so much for leaving us this glowing review!

New widows have been installed and they look beautiful!  We did have an issue with installation, however, once I let Jack M. know, Sergio, the Install Supervisor contacted me and the problem was resolved quickly and to my satisfaction. Also, Andrew & Vince, the installation crew, were  efficient, thorough and pleasant.

AMV did a great job for us and we are very happy with the new windows.

Albert came to measure for our new windows and was very helpful!  He did a thorough job and clearly explained the process of what we can expect when our new windows arrive! Great job Albert!< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>At first it was Jack the salesman who contacted me and came twice to evaluate my situation. He told me what needed to be done, what was not necessary. He saved me lots of money. Then came a guy to measure all windows and sliding doors.
One month later, when the customer-made windows and doors are ready, office called to set up appointment for installing.  The crew consisted of Henry, Enrique and Andrew the first day, Henry, Enrique and Gio the next day. They arrived a little before 8:30 am. First day they stayed for 7 hours, second day 9 and 1/2 hours. I can see they are an efficient team. Not only the work was done in a timely matter, but also they are pleasant when talking to me and among themselves.
Will recommend to anyone who wants to have the windows and doors replacement done. It is a "retro-fit" job, not taking down the entire windows and frames. They explained to me clearly up front.</review>< gmap_id>

Had one window replaced three years ago and was amazed at the wonderful service and quality of the window. We are now replacing several more and have continued to be impressed by quality and price, as well as the courtesy and professionalism of the personnel. Jesse, our sales guy, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, very helpful without being pushy. Albert, our window measurer, was kind, courteous and thorough in his explanation to me of everything in the contract and how the installation process would work. I cannot recommend highly enough!<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My experience was enhanced by a problem. The installers Octavo, Jose, and Andrew arrived on time. The windows were to be installed but Octavo said the wood on the outside prevented a good seal and install.  Just as they were about to reschedule our salesman Craig called the office and created the time for the extra work that day. Everyone worked hard even through lunch to make sure the three windows and two sliders were installed and sealed. They need to come back to finish the inside trim but it was great that they got the wood off and back on in the same day.<//review>< pics>

On the other hand with the company it self, there was a problem with the product. I bought Mar Vista Windows and what was delivered was Monte Vista which is a total different product than stated on my contract. At this time I'm just waiting for an explanation on this mishap .<//review>< name>

<review>I am very happy with the services provided to us by American Vision Windows. We first used them several months ago to replace a sliding door in our home. We were so impressed by their product and the service that they provided us that we went back to American Vision Windows to have all 26 other windows in our home replaced by them last week. I was a little hesitant about the installation date that we had chosen because my husband was going to be out of town and it was just going to be me home with our two toddlers during the job. However, from the moment the installers (Henry, Corey, Enrique, and Adam) arrived, I could see how professional and courteous they were and felt completely comfortable with them in our home. They worked very efficiently, covered our floors and furniture before they started, kept our home clean throughout the process, and showed me how all the features worked before leaving. I truly feel that they did a fantastic job for us. My husband and I highly recommend them for your next project:)<//review><Rate>5<//Rate>< name>

<Review>Incredible experience with American Vision Windows!!! I had a front door, security door and fire door to the garage along with 3 windows from 1979 that needed to be replaced desperately. The team arrived on time and had everything done by 3:00 pm as they had a crew working on each area that needed to be renovated. Everyone was professional, courteous and respectful of my property and my neighbors as well.  When the job was complete you would never know that I had any construction  going on just a few hours earlier.  A HUGE THANK YOU to JESSIE, MIGUEL, SERGIO and ENRIQUE for doing such an amazing job!!!  I would highly recommend American Vision Windows to anyone who needs new windows and doors.<//Review><date>1564584512304</date>< rating>

I love this company.  From my very first inquiry Angie made me feel so comfortable and set me up with Peter to come over and tell me about the windows.  Peter called prior to arriving letting me know he was on schedule to arrive.  Peter made the window process extremely easy as he listened to what I wanted from my windows and made suggestions.  Absolutely no pressure.

Andy followed up twice on my window measurement appointment and then Albert called a couple hours prior to arriving to do the measurements.

Now I am just waiting for my windows to arrive and I’m super excited. This company thus far has exceeded my customer service expectations.

And I better thank John and Ken at KFI for constantly talking about American Vision Windows.  I guess I’ll be talking about them too!< /text>

We really appreciated how quickly our AVW rep, Robert Perry, responded to our request for consult and quote. We felt extremely confident with AVW windows quality, knowledge, installation crew, warranty, and pricing. We did not hesitate to choose AVW after several quotes from other window companies. We also loved Albert, our windows installer expert, who scheduled the official measurement appointment very quickly, arrived promptly, and was extremely professional, accurate, and informative.
We are excited and grateful for our American Vision Windows and their expert crew.</Review>

Quality materials.  Installation a bit average.  Did so mild damage on the house.  Installation seemed rushed and informed the installers touch was needed.  Frame work wasn't top quality of cutting and installation.  Installers were polite and would follow up on requests.</review>

< Review>
Before I met Craig with his Anlin door system. I had been unhappy with the sliding door installed by the builder on my place for quite sometime but wasn't sure if I was ready to invest in an upgrade. Then I called American Vision for an estimate to see what my options were. They sent out a gentleman named Craig who ran me through my options. His level of customer service and product knowledge made me feel at ease with my decision to upgrade. He took me through the benefits and features of upgrading my sliding glass door and was patient with all my detail oriented questions. I wanted to be sure I was making the right decision and I'm sure glad I did! I can't say enough great things about American Vision. The installation crew was beyond amazing and friendly. A big shout out to Henry, Jason, Albert, and Joel for being so professional and friendly to me during the process. Their communication and attention to detail left me confident in my decision to go with American Vision. I was surprised and pleased too that the communication with Craig didn't end at the sale, he called me the day of install to make sure I was treated well and happy with the results and assured me he was only a phone call away for any future concerns. If you are in the market to upgrade your windows or doors look no further than American Vidion, these guys are at the top of their game!!!< /Review>

Beautiful window!  The crew Brian, Johny and Eric did a great job with the  demolition of our garden window and conversation to a single large window.  They guys worked hard and also did a great job cleaning up a major mess.  American Vision Windows is a great company to do business with.  Everyone who I have talked to is so pleasant and professional.  Thank you all for everything.</Review>

<Text>Wow what a company! Long story short. About 18 years ago we had all of  our windows replaced by AVW during our remodel. They explain that the framing sealer was the best out there. That it would last many years. Well 18 years later I noticed a bit of shrinkage around the edges of out front windows to the point where there was a gap where I thought  water may enter during a rain. I called them and in a few days 5 guys showed up, 2 trucks and they proceeded to scrape out old chalking and replace with updated better material. I have 32 windows . They were finished by about 1P.m. Amazing product support and customer service. I have  had zero problems with my windows. They still work and look like new. Every company should take a lesson from these guys. Highly recommended.
These guys have it figured out!
Thanks so much AVW!

This morning Albert from American Vision Windows arrived to do a second measure for windows to be installed. He explained each measure and was very thorough in explaining all the paperwork. He did a great job. He works out of the store in Orange CA on Katella.

<Text>Installers were great. Original salesman was nice but poor communication after we committed to buy. Final measurement guy had a language barrier and now we are stuck with a $10,000 accordion door we can’t lock or open from outside. That is a big deal. Been getting the run around since. Apparently American vision windows doesn’t make there own windows. Don’t pay full balance until you are satisfied. Timeline was also much longer than promised. Hope to get resolution soon</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1571691959479, 'text': 'Hello Joshua,\n\nThank you for sharing your experience with us, we appreciate your feedback.

Craig came to our house and showed us the Anlin window system. We were very impressed with Craig's professionalism and presentation. He thoroughly covered all of the details about several Anlin options with no pressure to go either way. After comparing several companies and getting several quotes we decided to go with American Vision because of the quality of their product and because we loved Craig! Thanks!< /Text>

<review>I've been listening to their radio spots for years on AM talk radio. When it came time to price new replacement windows last year, and they came back in the search results, it was a safe bet to meet with them.

Glad I did.

They were 100% the better selection in my honest opinion. Every step of the way. From the initial meeting - getting the best window package we could afford with no pressure sales tactics, to scheduling the work and the actual installation. Totally professional outfit.
Go ahead give them a chance when getting multiple qoutes it wouldn't hurt.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Henry and Enrique did the install of our 4 windows and one slider. They arrived on time and did a fantastic job on the install. They are both highly trained and experienced installers. They are extremely attentive to details and the windows and door look like they are original equipment, not at all like inserts. I can’t say enough about the quality of their work and the quality of the Anlin windows and door. I highly recommend these Anlin windows and slider and American Vision Windows.  The sales rep was professional and explained all their products, the technician who measured was professional and accurately measured everything so there were no install issues, and the scheduling of the install went perfect. 10 stars!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Updated review: American Vision Windows did a good job of replacing the windows and 2 sliding doors in our house. One big complaint, however, is that they left a bunch of tiny plastic shavings on our front lawn. These were very difficult to clean up since they are small like dirt but they are plastic pieces that stand out (they are white), and I'm sure it's not good for the grass, either. I think they should have laid out plastic underneath the framing pieces that they were cutting, and/or do it on driveway where it is easier to clean up than on the dirt/grass.

Previous review: So far we have signed the contract and had Albert as our measure tech to come out and do all the final measurements. He did a great job of answering all of our questions and explaining the details. I will update this review when the windows and sliding glass doors are installed.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd76bd975c089:0xf4195772558d4a20<//Gmap_id><Date>1602730203697< /Date><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

<Text>The staff of American Vision Windows gets 5 stars.  Craig, the representative met with us in our condo and went over the options in a professional, timely and efficient manner.    We chose the Anlin Del-Mar and Malibu Series Windows and Doors.

The remeasure for production of the windows was completed on schedule and the windows arrived ahead of schedule with the installation scheduled at our convenience.

The installation date and start time was reconfirmed several days before the actual install and the installers, Henry, Juan and Enrique arrived on time and did a great job.  They were considerate and did an excellent job on the removal of the old windows and doors, installation of the new windows and cleanup.  The installation took the exact time estimated and was an efficient operation.

We live on a busy street and the windows and doors have eliminated nearly all the outside noise.  I was skeptical such quietness could be achieved.  I'm a believer now.

Definitely would (and have) recommended American Vision to our Neighbors.

Thanks to the entire team of Craig, Henry, Juan and Enrique for their professionalism.

American Vision replaced a garden window in our hallway bathroom.  The pre-install process was efficient and the window delivered earlier than I was expecting.  Price was about what I expected.  Mak and Pascual came out to do the installation on 8/21/19.  They were friendly, fast and respectful.  They cleaned up after themselves, too.  I appreciated that.  I'll use American Vision again when I replace the last of the old windows in my house.< /Text>

Octavio showed up on time and introduced me to Miguel his assistant and prior to starting asked me what are you doing to your house? First I thought why would that matter but I told him we were in the middle of remodeling
He then asked how WE would like the windows finished and then gave me a couple of suggestions and after hearing what WE intended to do he suggested a way so that we would not have to do double the work
Very thoughtful, and they took out and installed 7 windows in just under 6-1/2 hours. Nice job and when I showed him a couple screens that were not 100% took them and rescreened them on the spot
Octavio is the man and when you have the company do your windows, ask for him by name<//Text>

I ordered French Doors from American Vision Windows and I was very pleased with the workmanship.  I was also very pleased with the workers that installed the doors.  The lead worker was Pascul and he was a real pleasure to work with.  His helpers were Prymo and Bob. Although Sergio was not on the job I understand he is the supervisor for this crew.  The doors came out beautifully and the workers were very professional. They cleaned everything up when they were done.< /Review>

<name>Joan M<//name><Time>1564783244091<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I recently had several windows installed by American Vision and am happy to  report exceptional service and product !! The five stars are for two noteworthy personnel - Craig and Albert. Let me explain:

Craig is the one who sold me the product and didn't stop there; he was not only available at every turn when I called, but took immediate action when there was a problem with requests of mine not reaching the installers. It turned out to be a miss communication between a vacationing regular employee and a substitute - word failed to get to the latter. Craig researched the problem, took whatever action was necessary and apologized to me, even though it was not his fault.

Albert was so impressive not only with his accuracy in measuring for the windows, but for his kind and helpful demeanor. He took each measurement several times to make sure it was correct, and when the windows arrived, they fit like a glove!!  Also, he always addressed me with "ma'am" added to his comments and replies.

The two individuals above are indeed a credit to American Vision Windows  !!!!!!

In Appreciation,

We had a new window installed and some damaged wood repaired/replaced due to water leak. We are pleased with the crew they sent for the project. Highly experienced and skilled for what needs to be done, Leo, Jose and Albert have done such a great job. I can say they just planted the seed with a first-time customer for repetitive business in the future. I know we will enjoy the new window.  Even though it is a bit pricy, it is worth it as the experience is a good one. We will continue to be happy as long as the leak issue never comes back.   Thank you American Vision Windows.</Text>

That's why we did not hesitate to call AVW to replace the rest of our windows.  Today we had an amazing crew come out and replace 8 windows.  They were all very friendly and professional with their installation. They were on time and did an awesome job.  Thank you Cory, Ralph, Jason, Ricky, and Primo.  You guys rock!  I would highly recommend AVW to anybody looking for new windows or doors.

They were the most professional. Ski was our salesman and was very easy to work with. He explained the difference of the windows offered and helped us to decide what was right for our needs. We chose the Anlin Del Mar Series and could not be happier.
Albert who came in November 2019 to measure and did an excellent job explaining everything and was very attentive to explaining details for all our 23 windows.
We were very hopeful that our new windows would be installed before the end of the year. American Vision Windows were very accepting/supporting of our request. Andy kept us informed of the process in case there was an opening and there was, December 31,2019 and the windows were installed.
Our installers were: Jesse, Miguel, Andrew, Octavio, Gio, Jonathan, Chuy, Bob, Refugio, Ralph and Primitvo, all which showed up on time at 8:00am on 12-31-19. We couldn’t believe how well organized and professional they were with so many workers. We tried to stay out of the way but were so amazed at how well all was working. We had 23 windows replaced in 5 ½ hours. It was great.
They did have to make a replacement, as one piece of glass was scratched from the factory. Ralph made notations on all our paperwork and said that we would get a call from the corporate office when the replace glass arrived and sent up a date to come back out to correct.
We had decided at our original purchase not to do our bay window in the kitchen. After all the new windows were in (looking great) we decided to call Ski back out and right up another contract to get the bay window ordered as well.
Today, we had the one piece of glass replaced by Ralph and Primitive. Albert came back to do the measurement on the bay window so that can get ordered.< /Text>< Name>

<Review>We just finished the measuring for our windows.  Albert did a very complete and professional  job.  From Craig our sales person to Albert everything went as clock work.  You did the first part of our house 8 months earlier and that worked out very well.  We have been customers for over 15 years.  We had a condo in Palm  Desert and several years ago you did all our windows.   With the desert being very hot our large front picture window started to buckle some two years after initial installation.  Your company sent a team from Clovis to reinstall the window  covered under your warranty.  They spent the night near us and showed up the next day to do the installation.  That is SERVICE...<//Review><UserId.>110823705487728168173</UserId.>< resp>

< review>
I did a job on my previous house with American Vision Windows, the price was right and the quality was superb, the installation crew was quick, professional and very nice, they went out their way and put up some drywall repair for my window in the garage, I did not even ask them because it was in the garage, and they said it would not look right and made a nice patch work on an arch window.
When we bought our new house I knew I would call hem again for the windows and I am glad I did, Craig came on time and was very informative. I liked he was not pushy with the sale, we have 4 sliding doors in good shape, but I was thinking about replacing them anyways, but Craig said that the doors are good quality and in a good shape, so we decided to keep them. We received a very competitive quote from Craig, which he was able to reduce even more when we asked for best and final price. As always a very pleasant experience with American Vision Windows. Our order is in and being manufactured, I will update the review after installation which I am sure will be fast and flawless.</review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>I am in the middle of the process of purchasing/installing new windows.  Thus far my experience has been really great from Peter Stein my sales rep to Mike Jackson the store manager and Albert Ibarra who came to do the measuring today.  This company came highly recommended and so far I am very happy with the decision to move forward with this team.  All of the gentlemen were very knowledgeable and took the time to answer all of my questions with out hesitation and/or any pressure to purchase the product.  Can't wait to see the end result!

The end result is now in and I couldn't be happier.  What a difference it has made to my home.  Let's talk now about the installation crew; Octavio, Henry, Ralph & Larry - this crew was top notch.  Very clean, professional and pleasant to have around for the day.  Answered all of my questions and stayed into the evening to make sure everything was cleaned up.

AVW was recommended to me by a colleague and by far one of the best recommendations that anyone has provided to me.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>We absolutely love our windows. Look great and keeps our condo from overheating or being too cold. What puts American Vision Windows over the top is their guarantee/warranty work. We have had a cracked window in the past and they were out within 24 hours to fix for FREE! After the recent rains we noticed there was a small leak and Albert & Larry were here the next day to fix the issue. The customer service is remarkable. Highly recommend to anyone.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1549482704451, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving us a 5-star review, Randell!

We had a leak in our windows that American Vision installed a few years ago, so we called to get it fixed.  Albert and Larry showed up (actually a little early which was great) to do the work.  Albert sprayed the window seals on the retrofit windows and no leak appeared.  Then he sprayed from above the original frame and within 20 seconds, it was coming into the house.  Since it was our frame and not the installed windows within the frame, it was actually our problem.

But both men spent a good amount of time repairing the water damage inside, caulking everything, including above the frames of all three windows outside even though only one was leaking. Then Albert explained to me how the frames should have had flashing above them to prevent this issue to begin with. But he said hopefully what they did will fix it.

They went above and beyond even though this was not the fault of the installed windows.  Great service!<//Review>

The windows and sliding doors were installed over a year ago now and I couldn't be happier!  Dealing with American Vision from start to finish has been a breeze.  The salesman, Jay, answered all of my questions.

I had to work during the installation.  I am told the installers were fast and clean.  Several neighbors stopped by during the day to compliment the new windows.  They really look great!  I highly recommend the Del Mar window.  The house is much cooler and quieter now.  Thank you, American Vision.< /Text>

<Text>AVW did a fantastic job on retrofitting my windows.  My neighbors provide plenty of complements!  My wife loves them!  The AVW staff from sales, reception, management down to the installers were very easy to communicate with, professional and courteous.  Only a few issues were my kitchen window was fitted with sliding the wrong way.  However, AVW addressed the issue immediately as there was a lack in communication between myself and the final measurement with their staff member Albert.  Nevertheless, Albert was very professional and courteous and indicated he would address the issue and apparently it got lost when the windows were being manufactured.  However, AVW is in the process of ordering my new window and will install the kitchen window once the corrected window is completed by the manufacturer.  Though AVW is not the cheapest in terms of retrofit vinyl windows, they did a fine job overall.  Some very minor damage to the exterior stucco and interior paint, but easy for me to fix on my own.  I would not hesitate to recommend AVW for your window needs.  However, do your research before hand and understand why you would spend a substantial amount of money for retro fitted vinyl windows and weight the pros and cons of wood vs. fiberglass vs. vinyl to be sure this will be the correct investment for your home.<//Text><date>1577069123227<//date></record>

This company came recommended by a neighbor. They left so many dings and scratches in our drywall and damaged furniture. They still have not remedied these yet have the nerve to ask for more business from us. The product is fine but we have other neighbors that got new windows from another company that left no damage to the property. Beware going with this company.</Review>

July 14th update...I was hoping to hear back from American Vision windows by the end of this week...Although I never got a call or email we did receive a full refund on the shades...Thank you for making us feel like we mattered.  We both work hard to make the money to improve our home and this was our first major improvement.  Thanks again!!! We do LOVE THE WINDOWS!!!
The windows  are Great! Installation was smooth and installers friendly and helpful...trying to get a call back when the shades came apart IMPOSSIBLE - VERY DISAPPOINTED AND STILL WAITING FOR A RETURN CALL...The shades were also lifetime warranty. Only to find.out 2 weeks after installation they stopped selling and installing shades and told we would have to go through manufacturer in the future. This is not what they told us or what we signed up for.  Now  I want them to pick up the shades since I cannot get a call back to fix the problem. We signed up with American Vision and that is who should carry the warranty. We spent $1100.00 for the shades...Not the quality I expected...BIG Lots would have probably been better quality...But, LOVE THE WINDOWS</text>

<Review>The installers that did our job were amazing! I'd like to thank Isidoro, Pascual & Sgrgio! They installed 2 bay view windows and a slider all in the same day. The new bay view windows were slightly smaller than the ones they replaced and they had to do some custom modifications; they did a wonderful job and did not charge us for the extra work. This is my second time using this company and I will be calling them again for a 3rd time on another property in a few weeks! Highly recommended!<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1557356131403, 'text': 'Hello Cindy, thank you so much for the wonderful recommendation of our service!

<text>Windows were installed and American Vision Windows did a great job.  Three crews were dispatched with 9 employees to remove the old windows and install the new windows.  The team (Rigo, Ricky, Eddy, Henry, Enrique, Juan, Andrew, Jesus and Primo) were detailed and easy to work with during the install. The new windows are beautiful and keep the home both cool and quite. Definitely recommend American Vision Windows.

Just had Craig out to quote our windows and sliding door.  Craig was very knowledgable and thorough when presenting the Anlin window systems.  He was easy to work with and answered all our questions.  As a result of all his detailed information we chose to move forward with Craig's solution.<//text>< UserId.>

<text>Craig came out today and made a valiant effort to educate us on window construction, advantages of the various options available and what worked best for our house.
We have had several window vendors in but the quality or price was not there.
Also, it is rare for us to make an impulse buy on anything of this magnitude. But in this case it was rather simple. Quality is easy to see in the product. Why wait. Call American Vision Windows today and ask for Craig. You will be very satisfied.< /text>< Pictures>

The installers were punctual and completed all window replacement in about 6 hours. The windows look great.

<Review>Had many windows and sliding doors replaced over the last 4 months and I am happy to say these guys arrived when they said on the day and time and were always friendly and professional. The windows and work are awesome in every aspect. Today Jesus and Jason worked all day and did some pre-install construction work, plus installed two large windows. Both guys were very friendly, explained the process and worked with me to make sure I was fully satisfied before they left. Not only was everything perfect BUT the construction debris was all cleaned up and the window look magnificent. Thanks to all the folks at AVM including our sales guy Jay for making this a seamless experience in every aspect.</Review></record>

Love American Vision.  They did our Anlin windows a while back, and they have held up amazing.  There was some issue and they came back and fixed it right away.  This time we wanted an Anlin door to replace our ‘80’s original door.  Craig, the sales/project manager is great.  No pressure, patient, doesn’t try to upsell, and is just into making sure you’re happy and will be happy after the install.  He comes around and personally checks on installs as they work.   They use their own guys, which is great, because if there’s ever a question about how stuff was installed, etc, you know where to find the actual people who did the work.  We got a beautiful slider door this time, that he helped me pick out based on all these criteria I had.  The install guys, Carlos and Eric came out on time, and worked non stop in million degree heat, as quietly and quickly as they could.  Super nice and friendly and neat.  Covered and cleaned up everything.   I’ve recommended AVW to friends before and they always leave people pleased with their product and work.  You won’t be disappointed!</review>

Many people would think that only small business owners would offer better price and service and American Vision Windows, a large business company, would not.  In our experience, American Vision Windows gave us a fair price and provided us excellent customer service for our new windows and door.  For the in-home estimate, the windows measurement and the installation appointments, AVW people from Orange location all showed up on time as scheduled.  AVW installers first covered our flooring before starting the windows install and cleaned up the work areas after finishing the installs. The installers were friendly and they worked hard to clean every new windows and door spotless.  During our new windows install, an installer accidentally damaged our newly purchased and very expensive lamp.  AVW at Orange location promptly reimbursed us for the cost to repurchase a new lamp without any hassles and delay! Thank you Juan/installer crew and American Vision Windows.</review>

<text>From the sales representative to the installation, this company was professional, courteous, cost effective, and quality, quality, QUALITY!   We are very pleased with our entire house of new windows and the new french door.  I think we were most impressed with the installation, the crew arrived on time, (something we've never experienced before with any company doing work on our house) went straight to work and like a well choreographed dance went about removing old windows, putting in new ones and cleaning as they went along.  Even when I got a little nervous about the hole that was being cut in the side of the house for the new door, they were very patient and courteous.  They walked us through the functionality of each window/door at the end of the installation.
Whenever asked about where to get windows new or replacement, American Vision Windows will be the only company we will recommend!

We had a wonderful team (Pascual, Miguel, Eric, Andrew, Jesse, Vincent) work on our windows! We had to replace our replacement windows with new construction due to a poor prior install and these guys were amazing! They completed all the windows on time, were precise and exacting in how the windows fit, cleaned everything up everyday and tolerated my kids checking on their progress every 5 minutes (haha)! We would highly recommend AVW and especially the team who worked on our house!</review>

<Review>I had 11 windows, including 2 glass doors installed with Anlin Window Systems (ultra high performance) and I couldn't be more pleased.  The price was reasonable in comparison to other quotes.  The salesman gave me all the information to help me understand my options, and he never used pressure.  All appointments were prompt to the minute.  The installation crew was excellent, and their clean up was perfect.  In every aspect, this company exceeded my expectations.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Quite honestly if you use them once, you will not use any other company. They are a professional group and as was the case with the first installation, everything worked according to pre agreed upon plan.

They covered everything to insure minimal dust. I could tell they had planned out the job for optimal installation time! This time I had 5 windows, one French door and one large sliding door. Almost get they rehearsed what they were going to do.

When I spoke to the company on Friday, they told me when they would start and when they would end and they were done 30 minutes early. This was important to me because I am leaving town tomorrow!

The crew who completed my installation were Albert, Isidoro, Alex, Chun, Bob and Larry! I can’t thank them enough! Excellent job!

Thank you American Vision Windows!

Craig Giras was out today to give us a quote for a new front door and French door in the back of our house. It's 7pm on a Friday and he was so thorough and gave us great customer service. The quality and selection of doors was also VERY impressive. We are so excited to see the doors when they came in. I highly recommend American Vision Windows!< /Review>

American Vision Windows.   Feb. 7,2019.    The sales rep, Jay Childress, was knowledgeable and answered all our questions. He was also quick to respond to any questions we had after his visit. Our windows were installed by Cory and Gio. They arrived on time and did a thorough , efficient job with the installation, and cleaned up afterwards. Our windows are beautiful, and we are very pleased with American Vision Windows.    Barb and Chuck</review>

<Text>American Vision Windows and the entire staff was excellent! Peter Stein, the salesman was very knowlegeable. He answered all of questions and didn't pressure us at all to make a decision. They scheduled the measuring tech for the very next week and he came exactly when he was scheduled. The windows were delivered on time and installed on schedule. The installation crew was friendly and respectful and finished by early afternoon. When they left we couldn't even tell they were here except for the new windows. Everything went so smoothly we are now buying shutters from them. We would highly recommend American Vision Windows without hesitation!</Text>< pics>

We had 2 good bids to replace our 30-year-old 6' Pella slider with a French Door. We decided to go with AVW even though their bid was a tad bit higher than our 1st one. Jay, our project manager, really explained and showed us the differences between the 2 possible choices. There was no pressure to buy but, after understanding "why" AVW was the superior choice, it was a no-brainer.  We had to wait about a month for manufacture and installation (we chose an etched-glass version), but the crew was amazing - fast, efficient, careful, clean. We could not be more pleased than we are with our beautiful new French Door from American Vision Windows.</text>

<Text>I have nothing but positive things to say about American Vision Windows. Form the initial contact with the sales representative (still there more than eight years since our windows were installed ... they must treat associates right) to the install, to a warranty issue handled easily, to followup orders for doors ... EVERYTHING went smoothly. And I mean everything.

They even took less time to install the original order for all the windows (we have a LOT of windows in the house) than originally planned because their installer crew was so good.

I recommend AVW to everyone.</Text><GmapID>0x80dcd76bd975c089:0xf4195772558d4a20</GmapID>< rate>

I called American Vision Windows based on the great reviews, but my experience was with very poor customer service.  I called yesterday and the person who took my name and number down asked me to spell my last name FIVE ++ times, my name is only 5 letters long and I said it the first time where there was an "m" it's "M" as in "Mary", "N" as in Nancy etc.  I was patient but after they did get my name right, they took my number and said a sales scheduling person would call me.

Number One Window Company in California is a deserved ranking. The sales rep who visited us and thankfully explained everything we didn't know we needed to know, answered all our questions and offered us options we were thankful to receive. The measurement person was courteous, informative and very efficient checking and double checking what the sales rep had recorded and measured. Great experience to this point and then the installation crew arrived.

Careful and cautious from the get go, the crew arrived on time and proceeded to remove the old windows making as minimal a mess as possible and cleaning up as they went. The installation took several hours and when complete the crew chief took the time to explain the workings of each of the windows including their safety features. I know we have new windows but when you look out of the house it is hard to believe that there is anything there because of the clarity, even when looking through the windows with screens.

The crew spent a great deal of time cleaning up after their work even sweeping the carpeting and the tile floors. Before they left the crew chief pointed out a "flaw" in one of the windows explaining that it would have to be replaced. The flaw was pointed out to me otherwise I would have not seen it. Two company originated follow-up phone calls later and a quick one hour visit by the "fix-it" team all my windows are now "perfectly beautiful". I have nothing but good things to say about the entire experience, and my visiting relatives and my neighbors have all made favorable comments as well.

An excellent rating is as high as this survey offers so that is how I responded. If there was an "excellent plus" option that is where my response would have been.<//Review>

I talked with several different companies before settling on one company.  I didn't want to go to all the effort and expense to install mediocre windows that might prematurely fail to perform the way I wanted.  Also, I wanted American made windows installed by actual employees that are trained by the company, not subcontractors.  American Vision Windows easily met all my needs, and their Anlin Del Mar series seemed perfect!

Our salesman, Robert, did a great job helping us select the perfect set of windows for our needs.  Robert was able to generate fast quotes and last-minute changes with sleight of hand, which was super helpful considering my wife's indecisiveness.  Eventually, we pulled the trigger on a last-minute bay window with Queen Anne engraving.  Robert was able to reassure us both throughout an otherwise expensive, confusing process.

Probably one of the more important issues that came up was the city's fire egress requirements.  Turns out that windows must have a minimum size and area that allow for firemen to enter each bedroom in the event of a fire.  My house is old enough that the original windows were no longer up to the current building code.  All the other companies that I met with had missed that requirement and quoted me for windows that would never pass a building inspection!  Upon entering my bedrooms, however, Robert immediately noticed that my windows would have to be enlarged.  Sure, that meant I had to pay more money, but Robert's knowledge and obvious honesty made me want to rely on American Vision Windows for the whole job!

There is a certain amount of time that must pass between signing a contract for new windows and the actual day of installation--the windows are made according to measurements taken on the house.  But I was not left in a lurch during this time!  American Vision Windows periodically sent out emails informing me about the current state of my windows, what to expect next, information about how my windows were being crafted, as well as information about the company from Bill & Kathleen.  Once my new windows were finished being crafted, Andy and Ryan called me up and schedule a day and time for the installation.  Andy was also super helpful and worked closely with me during scheduling my building inspection with the city.

On installation day, three trucks arrived at 8:00AM full of workers ready to get started installing my new windows.  Within minutes, Pascual, Miguel, Carlos, Aaron, Henry, and Brian were working in every room of my house, removing my old windows and installing the new windows.  As I mentioned above, a couple of my windows had to be enlarged to meet the city's building codes.  These guys were great--with machine-like precision, they demoed my old windows, prepared my rough-in window openings, cut into the stucco where necessary, reinforced my house's frame, and installed the new windows and the bay window by, like, 3:00PM.  The enlarged windows and the bay window would require some stucco patch work, but on the inside, everything was painted with primer and ready for fresh paint.  Even without paint, though, everything looked so much better than before!

On stucco patch day, Albert and Joe arrived promptly at 8:00AM and had everything patched and stuccoed by 12:00PM or so!  These guys are super skilled in cement work--they even modded some brickwork near my kitchen windows so they'd match all the other windows.  Albert and Joe happily worked with me and answered all my questions about cement, stucco, primer, and paint.  And, their stucco work looks better than I had imagined, I can't wait to paint it!

I am grateful to all of these guys for their solid skills and great work, and I am super glad I went with American Vision Windows.  Too bad I can't hire them to renovate my back yard, lol.  So, I wholeheartedly recommend American Vision Windows for all you window needs!<//review>

<Review>Heard about American Vision Windows on KABC radio and as we needed new windows in our living room, we gave them a call. The windows are not only beautiful but really keep the cold and the heat out. The 2 men who installed the windows did an excellent job and was very neat during the installation. We had no trouble obtaining  approval from our association and also the City of Newport Beach. We would recommend American Vision Windows to anyone who needs new windows. They are the very best.<//Review><userid>106424430812188898604<//userid>< response>

5 stars well deserved for Craig and his team at American Vision Windows installing my new custom Anlin windows and doors. Made right here in the US of A, these windows couldn't make me more proud! Craig was very good to explain everything from the beginning, no surprises like there always seems to be with any construction. Any possible hiccups with permits, issues they might find with how the previous windows were installed, all was easy to understand. He also helped us get approved for the Hero program which helped tremendously with financing.

The team arrived exactly on time, a friendly crew of 6 showed for my mediocre sized job (8 windows, 1 slider, 1 french door). Most other companies I would expect one or two guys to show up. They got right to it, protecting all my furniture and flooring around each area and began a neat an quick demo. They worked methodically, carefully and quick, communicating with each other along the way. Everyone was courteous, smiled and 100% capable. At no point did I ever have to question if they knew what they were doing.

From the day Craig came for the estimate to the windows being made to permits being pulled to day of install, I found American Vision Windows to be like none other in that they kept me in the loop every step. They want you to be involved and part of the process. The owners of the company send you kind and informative videos keeping you up to date as well.

All around, very happy and would recommend to anyone. I'll follow up with before & after pictures soon...stay tuned!< /review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Worst experience ever with the person that came out to give me a quote. First off he was 20 minutes late to our scheduled appointment.  All my doors and windows where measured out written on his form. Came out to 14k, He said I will hook you up and give you a special and do it for $9800.00. I said let me think about it. He left I put the paper work on my desk. A few days later I called him asked him to remove 2 of the windows from the quote and let me know the cost. He texts me and asked me if I could just subtract the cost from his quote and I explained I could not read his writing. He asked me for the quote number and I explained you did not fill anything out but the window sizes. So he asked me to send him a copy and I did. A few hours later he tells me the cost is 14k even with taking out the 2 windows and he made a mistake telling me $9800.00 that the $9800 was just for the white windows not the colored.  I let him know we went over the color needed while he was at my place and he said he could do it at $9800.00 that’s why it was written on the paper work and circled.

<Time>1340762273570< /Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>I know it sounds corny to think there are actually differences in a vinyl window, especially when you'd think a window is a window is a window, I mean, what's the difference?? They all look the same, smell the same, feel the same...right?
So the only difference would be price...No?

Well, NO!

About 8 years ago when our firstborn was just a little over a year old, we had 2 double windows in our house that needed to be replaced. Previous owners had installed some vinyl windows in most of the rooms except for the master bedroom and the front bedroom. We called American Vision Windows in Orange and asked them to come out and give us a quote. (I’d heard them on the radio station I was working at so I figured they'd save me some money…maybe even a lot of money).

However, their quote was actually higher than I expected, and definitely higher than some other window advertisers I had heard on the radio, so, I was really thinking about not using them.

But, my wife and I talked about it and in the end we chose to buy from American Vision Windows because we loved their business motto and we did see some differences in the make of the vinyl windows. To be honest, I didn't really care for the sales rep that much, but we absolutely loved what they were about as a company.

I'm so glad we decided to use American Vision!

Today, 8 ½ years later, those windows are still keeping the unwanted noise out, the cool air, and, or heat, in and looking like they're brand new. Amazing!

So many other companies that we considered buying from at the time are no longer in business so who knows what we would have ended up with. I just know that I'm glad American Vision gave us the option to purchase the RIGHT product back then because there's no way 3 kids and a new business launch later I could afford new windows now.

Way to go American Vision!!! We love you….<//text>< pictures>

I don't recommend, their customer service is terrible and it seems like they don't communicate with each other.  One example they called for payment and I paid then the following day they called for payment again. Also after they sent over their workers I thought they would be trust worthy but I come to find out that some jewelry was missing from one of my rooms.  So If you do use them make sure your always watching them.<//Text>

The salesman was a few minutes late but called to let me know.  He was knowledgeable about replacement window types and the advantages/disadvantages of each. The price was competitive for the type and quality of window. The salesman gave me a date about 5 weeks later to check status with the office.The "production measurement" guy was an hour late but completed his task quickly and thoroughly when he arrived, taking pictures so the install team knew what to expect. Due to the age of the house I needed a noninvasive lead paint inspection which went smoothly. The day before I was to call for status AVW called to schedule installation. The installation team arrived on time. Installation went extremely well, the performance was almost like a well choreographed dance. Drop cloths and plastic was used to protect floor and furniture. Cleanup was complete, even including some minor paint touchup. Installation was complete a few minutes earlier than the estimate given when I made the appointment.< /Review>

At first we were skeptical. How could a company live up to the promise of a virtually painless experience?  When the salesman came to our home he was extremely knowledgeable, answered all of our questions, showed us examples for the various window components, and demonstrated what the company was about.  But this was the only demo!  We really wanted new windows.  The old casement crank-style windows were a real pain.  The leaked air in winter and summer, driving our heating and cooling costs through the roof.  We placed our order and held our breath.

Although we had a few scheduling problems, one Friday morning at 9:30am the crew from American Vision Windows arrived.  Here was the truckload with our eight custom built windows, and all the crew needed, ready to start the install.  It was amazing to watch how they worked so well as a team.  Each performed their overlapping tasks of window removal, trim to perfect fit, install, insulating, and final trim with efficient expertise.  I had worried about how they were going to get the old windows out without tearing up the stucco.  How could they possibly do this in a day?  My fears went away when i saw how they skillfully removed the old windows, preserving the integrity of the existing frame.  The stucco was untouched, and the new Anlin double pane, argon-filled windows slid right in.  Our leaky, falling-apart garden window was gone in minutes, replaced by a beautiful kitchen window that was a perfect fit.

By 2:30 pm, eight windows on all sides of our house were installed.  We were amazed at the difference in the appearance of the house, both inside and out.  When they were done, the crew cleaned up and hauled away all the old windows and glass.

I would recommend American Vision Windows to anyone for three reasons.  1) The quality product they sell, 2) the job that the crew performed, and 3) Value I received for the money.  My only regret is that I didn't have this done four years ago when I first moved into the house.< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>I hired American Vision Windows to install 2 windows at my mother's house in Costa Mesa after reading strong reviews online.  We were looking to replace 2 small windows with 2 much larger ones.  I called them up and they sent someone over to do a free estimate right away.  He did the requisite measurements and gave us a very fair, surprisingly low price.  It took a month for the windows to arrive, but as soon as they did, I received a call to schedule installation.  Installing the windows took just one day, though it was a pretty big job: They had to cut the wall to make room for the large windows.  All in all, I am very happy with my experience with the company.  I definitely recommend American Vision Windows.<//review>< Rate>

We had a house full of windows replaced. Salesman was very professional and not too pushy like a couple other quotes we received.  Installers did a excellant job on the windows, kept the house very clean and when they left all garbage was gone.  I would be at the top my shortlist if I ever need windows again.  I highly recomonnend you at least get a quote from  American Vision Windows and if like me,  you may be plesently surprised.< /review>

Complete Fiasco, Great radio commercial but that's about it. Installer tells me the glass is the same size ? But I payed for window upgrade and should not be the same size. They agreed to leave the broken window for me to take it and have inspected to insure a got what I payed for but when they replaced the broken window they changed their tune and  told me I cant have the broken window ?? I don't know if this is common but I sure don't run my business this way. Guy flat out lied to me. I am upset to say the least.</Text>

<Text>Craig Giras was out to show us the Anlin product. Honest, knowledgeable and respectful of our time. Already have Anlin windows in our home, installed by a different company. Love the product, and getting a better price with American Vision for these! Great experience.</Text>< UserId.>

<text>While using the HERO program I choose AVW for an estimate on my windows and Craig came out and impressed us with his knowledge, professionalism, and integrity in showing us the Anlin line of windows and what AVW can do. Craig spent a few hours with us and it was painless and enjoyable. We're replacing our windows and patio door so he wanted to ensure that we knew of all the options and what quality in product and service we were going to get with Anlin windows through American Vision Windows. WOW. Thank you Craig for taking the time and showing us options and explaining everything about these windows!
I would also like to take a moment to thank the staff at AVW too for scheduling me in so quickly after my initial call to the HERO program.
Craig gave me an exceptional deal on the Del Mar luxury series windows and will continue to follow up with us as we continue the install process with American Vision Windows. Thank you Craig and AVW!<//text>< response>

<review>Contacted AVW to get a quote about windows/slider replacement and Craig came and gave a great presentation and provided a quote.  After getting a couple of quotes, I decided to go with AVW for the high quality products.  I decided to go for the top-of-the-line Anlin windows with ball bearings and the lifetime transferrable warranty.

Someone came out in 2 weeks and did a pre-production measurement just to confirm everything.  Windows were delivered and installed within 3 weeks!

Installation service has been excellent and very professional.  A 3-man crew arrived in the morning, quickly removed 5 windows and a slider and installed new ones by 3pm in the afternoon.  Fit and finish was top notch!  Very satisfied and will definitely use AVW again for my next property.

I have neighbors asking me about it, and I have referred them to Craig with no hesitation!< /review>< pictures>

We had the best experience from start to finish with AVW.  We had every window in our recently purchased home replaced, including sliding glass doors in our living room and our dining room.  Because our HOA said that many other residents in our community had used them and were pleased, we decided to drop by their location on Katella in Orange, CA.  That is where we first met and were impressed with our Project Manager, Amir Mozaffarian.  He was very patient and thorough explaining and answering all of our questions and concerns about the windows and the pricing.  We had no pressure at all to make a decision that day or to make an appointment for him to come and give us an estimate. Because of Amir, we soon after scheduled for him to come out, and again, he gave a demonstration of their excellent product and measured all of our replacements doors/windows.  Amir was there for us any time we called, he stopped by in person during the install, and again after they had finished. Also, all of the team of installers that were at our home were polite, friendly, did a fantastic job and cleaned up well before they left. The windows were installed in “one-day” and are beautiful and energy efficient.<//text>

< review>
We called AVW 6 months ago and decided that the timing was not right. Called back 6 weeks ago and our salesman came out and was more than helpful. We were having issues with our refrigerator and Marilyn scheduled our windows to be installed on the same day so we didn't have to take another day off from work. Then this past week end the wind was blowing really hard and knocked over our umbrella into our new window and ripped the screen. I called Dominick at AVW and what does he do , but help us and gets the screen fixed ASAP! That you AVW for your customer service!!! I will tell everyone if they need windows they only need to make one call!
Thank you again

I only have one word...Eldrin!!!  I came in really frustrated with the knowledge and service I received from this store during my previous visit.  I have been trying set up cell service for my sons new iwatch to no avail.  He clearly identified the issue and set us up in literally minutes. PS. Another woman came in from her previous visit equally upset. Eldrin helped her while I was syncing the iwatch and she left equally happy. Eldrin needs a raise!!!

All of the reps here are very nice- however knowledge is key and Eldrin has all of the key skills needed fir a perfect customer experience

Thanks again!< /Text>

The WORST service I have ever experienced at this store with Janet and another young man! Very rude and impatient . We were threatened and kicked out when we want to cancel lines.  They won't help us resolve issues and kept yelling to us. This is really unacceptable and horrible when customers have the reasonable request.<//text>

I had trouble with a dual SIM (second one is virtual) so I went in for a checkup for them to fix it. The technician wasn’t really able to help. I asked them to debug the issue but they weren’t able/willing. I asked to have my virtual SIM split out into a physical one. They were able to do that. I wish they had been able to debug the original problem instead of me giving them a less-good work around. But they got that to work so at least I have two SIM cards that work even if I have to manually swap them now 😐.< /Review>

I needed to change my sim card to nano sim.  I went to the AT&T in Palo Alto branch.  But for the workers from Palo Alto, this was not a feasible challenge.  He suggested that I change my phone number to another or cut off my old SIM card.  He couldn't just give me a new nano sim.  He told me different stories about security, etc.  He did his best to get me out of this place as quickly as possible and switch to another mobile provider.  The fact is that this is not the first impossible mission for AT&T employees from Palo Alto.  I decided to do one last try before changing my carrier and drove to AT&T in Mountain View (1040 Grant Rd Ste 120, Mountain View, CA 94040).  And you know. I'm very glad to have been able to meet the AT&T store staff from Mountain View.  Sam from Mountain View was able to handle replacing my SIM card in 5 minutes.  So thanks to Sam from Mountain View, I successfully exchanged my SIM card, my cell phone number did not change and I stayed with AT&T.  Now I will only go here.  I liked the quality of service and the professionalism of the Mountain View team.  Goodbye team from Palo Alto.</Text>

<text>Staff is very helpful and patient (in particular, Janet and Jose). They did try their best helping me solve my problem (transfer services from another carrier) despite AT&T internal systems & the other carrier were not that easy to work with. They also signed me up for a better deal than the original one I planned for.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>When I walked in the first thing I was asked was if I had my social security card as they needed to see and confirm my SS#. I have NEVER been asked to show my social security number before. The employee claimed that AT&T had been experiencing “fraud” and it was new company policy. The employee was extremely rude and patronizing. I promptly left as I felt uncomfortable with this. I went to the Santa Clara store and they confirmed this was NOT a company policy. Glad I left and went to the other corporate store location. AT&T Mountain View beware! You may have an employee stealing customers Social Security numbers.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< time>

<Text>Horrible customer service and disrespectful store manager. I came in with a eSim that was provided for me from Apple when I bought a phone. They could not activate the eSIM and asked me to purchase from them a new eSIM number, no matter what I said they were not willing to give me a free new number in view of the fact that they could not activate the Apple eSIM. Sad that in days we all pay at&t hundreds of dollars they are playing games with us on a $5 charge.<//Text>< Pictures>

They tried it many times and it never worked for them, so in the end they gave up with 'sorry the system is screwed'. I got home and realized there were several emails in my inbox asking to confirm my email address. Apparently they were not aware of that and didn't tell me, so their process got stuck every time.

This is the worst store i have ever seen regarding any service. The service person was totally uninterested in understanding or solving the issue. She was also impatient to listen the problem and was like call customer care without even knowing what the problem was.< /Text>

I needed to switch ISP/phone service. After three hours (!) on the phone with AT&T, either transferred or given another phone number to call--nine separate people, none of whom helped--I gave up and visited this store.
James was totally professional and helpful, and set me straight promptly. Not only did I get twice the ISP speed, but by bundling with my land-line phone and DirectTV I saved $20/month vs. my existing ISP/phone provider, who suddenly, with five days notice, decided not to accept my globally accepted credit card (after seven years as a customer).
PS I believe that AT&T's phone 'services' may be offshore and that the nine people with whom I talked did not clearly understand my simple needs.<//Review>

<text>The response on this which appeared was from 3 years ago.  We attempted to change by providing a full 5 stars to reflect the excellent service we received and the feedback ended before new information could be provided.  Rather on this past visit we found the assistance to be comprehensive and excellent in spite of the pandemic which has put everyone a little on edge.  The lady did a very thorough job of assisting us and then suggested other things we might consider to make working from home or while SIP to be faster and easier.    In short a new team and a new and more professional experience.  Please disregard the earlier comments!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Just had a very bad experience with the store. Had to visit multiple times to correct a mistake made by one agent there.

Went in to transition my phones to a multi-line prepaid plan, the agent kept telling us it was his first time to do this, and had to ask his co-worker more than twice to get it done. Yet the website went down in the middle, so he told us to go home and call 611 to finish the process. When we got home, we found we were over charged and he also put us on the wrong plan. We returned to question him, of course he denied that.  Having no proof, we simply left.

After calling the customer service 5 times, finally we found one customer representative who figured the whole thing out for us. Turns out the agent put us on the right plan initially, but when adding a second line, he switched the first line to the wrong one, 2 minutes after opened the account for us. Yet we are charged by the system for this switch. No wonder he asked us to go home to pay.

We have to return to the store an extra two times to talk to the manager to have the overcharge refunded. Of course the agent declined to take responsibility for it, again. He now starts saying that we may have changed it by web while at the store. The fact is that we did everything by his instruction at the store, while he operated on his pad and our phone. And anytime a change is initiated from customer side, the customer will get a text message confirming such a change. Yet we never got such a message on our phone.

Another telling thing is that the manager saw many credits being posted to our account, he even questioned our motive. Yet we never see such a credit from our balance. The fifth customer service representative did issue us a credit, to cover the cost to switch the plan to the right one, that is, to cover their own mistake. So at the end of the day, we still ends up with being overcharged. I assume that they may have messed up their payment system multiple times, so they internally issued quite some credits to cover their mistakes, to bring things back to normal.

A conclusion, disqualified agent, doubtful manager and many know-nothing customer support agents, till you find the right one. I would strongly advise you against visiting this store.</text><user_name>Hank Wang</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Rude customer service, impatient staff. We (the customers) have to know all the plans they have. They will not explain a thing to you. When you ask for what kind of plans they have, they will ask you back what you want without explaining anything. Walked out the door without any answers or anything done. Do not waste your time coming here, I would recommend going to another store. At least you will get your things done.< /text>

Took me 2 weeks for them to send someone out to fix my wifi. I am switching to Verizon. When they finally sent someone out to fix the problem he left after 3 hours and didn’t even check if it was working. Then when I called them they said they could send someone out for another two days. Would not recommend. Worst costumer service I have ever experienced.</review>

Very rude customer service representative in Mountain View store
Without listening to customers they just want to do what they are doing.

They have everything. But they give misleading information sometimes. I got iphone x which I was told can be fully charged within 1 hour. But it took more than 3 hours to charge. When I took it again to the store they said it actually takes more than 3 hours to charge with the original charger in the box.  I had to buy additional accessories to make it charge faster. They were totally misleading.< /text>

The staffs' attitude is the worst in this AT&T branches which the staffs don't really care about the customer and being rude. The staffs don't have patient to help and always say that "call customer service" or "that is not our responsibility to solve the problem." Also, I always see some staffs are talking with co-worker and watching television.< /Text>

<Review>We went into the store on Grant Road because my husband's phone quit working. The salesman told us that they didn't repair phones so my husband asked if he could look up our account to see if he was eligible for a new phone. He said my husband could purchase a new phone. Salesman then said the phones were over there, pointing to a shelf. I told him that we were not too familiar with the new phones and he said in a very sarcastic manor, "you don't need to be familiar with them to look." He never offered to show us the different options. He did not stand up until he saw that I was upset by his don't care attitude. I am guessing he didn't want to waste his time on senior citizens who don't buy the top of the line phones. We will  probably not return to that store again and we will not recommended that store to anyone.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808fb6d7d4b2a343:0xe24099c7eba8dbd5< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

After ordering new iPhone 6, went to this store to turn in my old iPhone 5
Waited for about 30-40 minutes to get service, that's the wait I expected at the store on the weekend.

While I was waiting I asked some Asian guy with a manager written on a name tag can I get a store credit for my old phone.  And he gave me this whole spiel about having to use credit here and now, or he will not take my phone back.  In actuality one gets a store credit card, which u can use towards purchases in store or to pay ur wireless bill.  I was able to get this card from a different store rep when my turn came.  If it wasn't for the "manager" fellow I would have given the store 4 or 5 stars< /review>

<user_name>Fran Millet<//user_name><review>My husband and I went in to see if we could get a discount on some of the services  that we had.  After spending 45 min. w/ Gladys & Desiree,  they came up with a plan that would save us money if we purchased an additional item.

After thinking it over at home, we decided that we really didn't need the new item that much.  The next day my husband went back to the store to ask for our deposit back & to cancel the contract.  Gladys & Desiree were very gracious & quickly cancelled the transaction.

We felt badly that they had spent so much time helping us, they are to be commended for their helpful & professional manner.< /review>< resp>

Very disappointed! I'm a customer for over 5 plus years,  received a bill from att with a number that is not mine. I was told the couldn't help me. I needed to call, and hold for ? I don't know 45 plus minutes , at their 1880 number. I think it's a fraudulent case,  the thought so too. Trying to save them (ATT) some money.  The only sell at there retail stores.  I think I'll let it sit for awhile, build up charges. Then let them take care of any harm that has come to me or my credit. Thinking of moving my company's 48 cell phones to some other provider. Remember , loyalty is not rewarded any longer. Treat them like a used peace of TP.<//Text>

Went to AT&T to get a new sim card and phone set up after I lost my old phone. The sales rep (forgot her name, unfortunately) was extremely helpful and patient during the entire process, and addressed a number of other questions I had unrelated to the initial issue. When she couldn't answer a question, the manager stepped in to help. Overall, a surprisingly great experience!< /text>

<Text>I went to the AT&T store because I had issues not getting Texts or MMS with my new phone. Ike assisted me in resolving this issue by replacing the SIM card. I would give Ike 5 stars for his support.
I basically give the 2 star rating to AT&T and its hostile policy against "bring your own unlocked phone". Turns out that certain features, e.g. WiFi Calling will not be enabled by AT&T if you haven't bought your phone from them, BUT you are required to pay the same service plan fees to AT&T as someone who gets the feature because he/she bought their phone from AT&T.
This is now the final straw and after 15 years with Cingular/AT&T I am considering to take my $220/month business to another provider.
Thank you AT&T for carrying so much about your customers!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I would have given them negative stars if that was an option. Rude sales people and an even more rude manager. I have a Note 7 that is being recalled. Per the notification I am trying to exchange it for a new Note 7 (at this point I don't know why). I made an appointment through the AT&T Live Chat for this very reason. I was told online that the notes in the appointment would reflect my need to exchange my recalled phone.

I get to the store and it is the same routine "we don't have you listed as an authorized contact" (btw I have been on that account for years and have been authorized person as well). But yet, I have the phone in hand and this is a recall that Samsung and AT&T are involved in. I'm not switching my phone for a better phone, just one that won't blow up. I show my appointment confirmation and they need to get a manager. Same story again. No help. Won't even look up the appointment to see the notes from the AT&T online chat person. I explain that this store needs to be "blown up" as it is pointless in helping anyone that is not buying new services. Sorry I can't help put more money in your pocket but wish to exchange my phone because my phone provider is telling me to. I am seriously thinking of moving to a new provider and being done with AT&T jump through hoops to get assistance with a faulty phone.< /review>< Pics>

Okay service. Like any others they wanna up-sell you, but finds 100 reasons to reject if you want to cancel any service. The most  annoying is that they don't want to cancel services in the store, and force you to call to special line which only works in business hours - insane!</Text>

< Review>
I came because a sim card under my name was not connected to LTE network nor can it text messages. All the assistant can tell is that our phone is not working with their system, some reset cannot be done manually and we need to replace our phone. I switched my other card to the phone and it’s working, then the assistant said he cannot help with anything on that. I think this experience goes far lower than my expectations on AT&T.<//Review>

<Review>I had the pleasure of working with Ryan Barrera about 4 or 5 times in the last couple of months.  First I upgraded my iPhone to the 6s and decided to get an iPad mini, then my son needed to upgrade his phone and he did and with his deal he also got a tablet that was thrown in, which he gave to his 9 year old son for Chanukah.  They are both also very happy.
Now my grown daughter needs a new phone so I am urging her that the next in she comes down from UCDavis we go and take care of her phone which seems to not be working correctly.
I will be happy to work with Ryan again</Review><gmapID>0x808fb6d7d4b2a343:0xe24099c7eba8dbd5</gmapID><user_id>113729816789152235583</user_id><name>Sue Timpson<//name><pictures>None</pictures><rating>5< /rating></record>

My wife switched to a new  phone,  got a nano SIM, and added a manager to our account in minutes.  Best ATT experience we've had in a long time.  AND it was a trainee that served us!<//review>

I was helped with two issues, including an issue with texting whereby my time stamped message to someone; that their response shows up ABOVE my message instead of BELOW my message...that I needed to reset my phone. So she reset my phone and problem was solved.</Review>

Probably one of the worst service provided. The guy who helped me was cocky, disrespectful and condescending. His attitude felt like I was wasting his time asking him questions. He had no patience and just wanted to make a sale. Will never go back here again< /review>

young asian kid behind the counter, keeps acting busy, acts like i am not there.
no question if someone is helping me , nothing. then he some more chatting with another guy and a girl working there. no word to me.
after asking if this is the highly praised ATT customer service, he asks me if i have pulled a number on the front desk and signed in - customer service at the lowest !!
thats it for me ATT
lets see what others have to offer for my hard earned money.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Came into the store to upgrade, because the options of phones and plans were confusing online. After the rep pulled up my account, she didn't really want to help me or give me recommendations. I have wireless, TV, and internet with AT&T. I didn't even up getting a phone there, but did do what she told me to do, 'go to the Apple store'.</Review>< gmap_id>

AT&T you need positive ppl to sell your service and products this service was  awful if I can leave less than one star I would
I was there and it's  exactly  what I want and I didn't get it  how  convenience for your customers !!!!?
I was there between 3 to 3:30 pm 11/8/17
I hope you can see what happened< /Review>< Pictures>

Terrible service here. I bought an iPhone and needed to return it while it was still brand new in a box and they made me wait behind a bunch of people trying to buy the same iPhone but they didn't have enough stock for them. It was ridiculous.< /Text>
