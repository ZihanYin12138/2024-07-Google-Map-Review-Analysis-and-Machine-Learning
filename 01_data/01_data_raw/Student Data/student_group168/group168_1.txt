Awesome office. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. The hygienist was awesome and explained everything as she was doing it and made me feel very comfortable. They were amazing with my son too. Dentist was happy and friendly and I felt very taken of. Highly recommend this office.<//Text>

I switched to this dental practice last year and am so happy I did.  Everyone who works there is super nice and they take the time to know your name.  They send reminders emails and calls.  They do not try to hard sell any extra services, only make suggestions you can decide upon yourself without pressure.  The dental cleanings are quick yet very thorough.  I take all three of my boys there too and it's the same experience for them as well.  I highly recommend this dental practice.< /Text>

What a great office! With a fractured veneer on a front tooth I needed to be seen ASAP. They saw me within 2 hours of my call. The Dr is amazing, quick and very thorough. I do not have insurance but I must say they have very reasonable fees. Warm and caring staff from the minute you walk in. I highly recommend them.</text>

Broke a tooth and they had a spot open for me the next day. Super professional and communicated through every step of the procedure. No up-sell pressure. Friendly and caring. I'd not hesitate to return and highly recommend this dentists office.</review>

Christy is just wonderful she always is personable, prepared , kind, gentle and encouraging. She makes me feel like my own daughter is taking care of me.  My teeth and mouth feel great when she is done.  Dr McMahan makes me and my teeth issues seem okay, that “we” are going to be just fine, and they always are.  I’m so glad he is my friend and dentist.</text>

<Text>Let me start by saying I hate the dentist. Totally scared of going. However, Surfside is extremely professional, provides a very specific plan and lays everything out perfectly. I had some major work done yesterday and I thought I would be out for days in pain, but no! I am back to work without missing a beat and only notice very minimal discomfort. I look forward to them finishing all the work I need and I highly recommend them to anyone!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Christie was an absolute wonderful dental hygienist. She was so attentive and took great care of my teeth as a new patient and someone who was in need of a cleaning after a year. I appreciated her attention to detail and she made me feel cared for. Dr. Paul was also great and I appreciated how he got to know me as a patient and also paid close attention to how my teeth looked.</Text>< pictures>

<review>While I always receive great service here, today I called for an emergency appointment because I broke my tooth. They are so nice, caring and understanding!! They squeezed me in this afternoon and placed a temporary crown while my permanent crown is made. I really appreciate that they are so accommodating and professional here, they sure do know how to put you at ease. It really makes going to the dentist no big deal!

Very professional, seems up to date on modern equipment that makes dentistry more comfortable for the patient. I come from an era of history when they had drills that sounded like they were grinding away, novacaine that’s didn’t always numb enough and uncomfortable dentist chairs. As a child I was afraid to go to the dentist even though he tried to be concerned and comforting. It was more the equipment than the dentist. I am still a coward but find that Surfside understands these fears and helps me to be more relaxed. Friendly, courteous and willing to work with you regarding fees and payments.<//review>

Had a great experience all around! Very well updated, clean office. They had good a good variety of music playing softly throughout the space/exam rooms. The tech cleaning my teeth did an amazing job accommodating to my request of being gentle on my gums, and the doctor did a great job filling my tooth. It was efficient, but not so efficient that you feel like they rushed the job. I'm honestly going to be sad when I move and can not see this dentist anymore!</Text>

Dalton is on point! Man has some real skill. Dr. Mac is also ridiculously skilled. On top of being amazing at what they do (dental work), I felt really welcome and the office has a nice vibe to it. It was tough finding a dentist when I moved out here so I'm glad I found this team.< /Review>

I have been going to Dr McMahan for 15 years!  He is great!  He is calm and he cares about his patients!  He puts this nervous patient at ease.  Kelly at the front desk is amazing!  She recognizes my cell number and calls me by name when she picks up the phone.< /Text>

Can't say enough about my experience.  I was treated very well, and though I had not been to the dentist in a long time, they really took their time and were thorough in cleaning my teeth.  One girl even missed her lunch to make sure I was taken care of in a timely manner.  Ill be back soon</Text>

Surfside Dental came highly recommended from close friends. When I made the appointment, they were nothing but professional and able to fit me in in a short timeframe. Though I only went in for a routine cleaning and exam, the hygienist was extremely thorough, patient, and gentle.

The office itself was very clean and well designed. All the equipment was well-maintained and from what I could tell, fairly new.

Happy to say I highly recommend Surfside Dental now, too!<//Text>

I found Surfside Dental by an almost random process when I retired to Oceanside four years ago, and I have remained a patient because of the skill and kindness of Dr. McMahan and his staff.  I highly recommend this dental practice.< /review>

<Review>My husband was terrified to go to the dentist for his bad experiences but we have finally found one AMAZING DENTIST!!! No lie he is caring and makes u feel so comfortable. Does not judge one bit! My husband is insecure about his teeth and he made him feel like everything is and will be ok. They gave him a plan on what needed to be done and walked him threw everything.  I loooove this place. Not to mention its clean not crowded like other place we've been to. Just over all a 10. If I could give them a 10.<//Review>< pictures>

I was truly relieved to learn that all was going well with my recovery of having two molars pulled the week before. Dr. Mc Mahan was very kind to check my tooth that was bothering me and very thoughtful of my concern.
I am very pleased with the care that I have received each time I have seen Dr. McMahan.  Thanks you so much, Joanne Natzke<//text>

<Text>I’ve been a patient of Surfside Dental for about ten years. Everyone is so friendly, professional and knowledgeable. Christie always gets my teeth sparkling clean and Dr. McMahan is the best dentist I’ve had. I trust his recommendations and never feel like I’m being oversold on unnecessary procedures. Kelly always has accurate information and out of pocket costs readily available for review. In a age where medical treatment feels like your just another number Surfside Dental stands out above the rest. They truly care about their patients and I actually enjoy my visits to the dentist!!</Text>< pictures>

I love Surfside Dental! I am a retired hygienist so I  know a good practice when I see one. Dr. McMahan is very thorough and gentle and Christy is a great hygienist!</text>

<text>My long time dentist retired and I chose Surfside for a trial visit based on reviews. The initial experience was excellent, more specifically: (1) the receptionist was prepared for the visit , no providing previously provided information was needed (2) the hygienist did an excellent job, I’ve had experience with other good hygienists but this one was A+ (3) Dr Mc Mahan examine was casual, straight forward and drama free. In summary a good experience.<//text><UserId.>111857342970653676179</UserId.></record>

My dentist of 20 years retired and my husband and I were referred to Surfside Dental.  This dental office and team are perfection!  Kelly, the office manager, couldn't be more pleasant & professional and Dr. McMahan is very friendly, kind, and empathetic to each dental situation.  He doesn't "push" his business or treatment onto patients like I have experienced at other dental offices. Surfside  Dental is  beautifully remodeled  which includes the most updated dental technology.

I used  to never want dental x-rays because of radiation exposure, but their x-ray equipment produces very minimal radiation.  Each time I walk into Surfside Dental I feel very calm and relaxed.  While in a dental chair I love being mesmerized by watching the  (large flatscreen TV) beach front webcams and listening to the calming music.  The entire Surfside Dental experience  could not be more pleasant! We are extremely thankful to have Dr. McMahan and his team providing our dental care! Another plus is parking. Parking is very easily assessable.<//text>

<Review>Dr. Michael McMahan is the best dentist we have ever had. Me and my whole family go to him. He makes a great job in dental work. I also recommended him to my coworker who is new to this area.

I have to say also about Christie- she is amazing. She does the best cleaning you can have. She is very thorough. We all go to her for cleaning. If you are looking for a great quality work go to Surfiside Dental and you definately will not regret! I have gone to other places while relocated and believe me I know how others try to just make more money instead of getting you quality job. This office makes a real difference in people's lives. One example is that my mom needed a special dental work done and Dr. McMahan has offered help right away! She was very happy that it was done. Dr. McMahan really cares about your health and beauty of a smile. I recommend Dr. McMahan to anyone who is looking for a dentist or is thinking to make change to the better!!! Do not waste your time calling anyone - just go there. Kelly is very nice too. She always is ready to make an appt for you wven if she is Super Busy! I uave been going to this office since 2010 and I am happy it is there still and definately qhen my daughter grows up to need dental check she would go there too.

One more thing- when you sit in the chair you see a TV screen with nature and it feels like you are on a vacation. I am super busy with my job and I do feel like on a vacation when i visit their office. They resolve all problems with teeth if there are any. Also they detect problems early on not to have complications later. I am happy to go there because I know that I will get the Best Care I can have because I know that they are super qualified and experienced to complete quality work in a timely manner.</Review>< pictures>

When I use to work at sfo I would stop by here for a quick bite. Their are quite a few things to choose from. Their wings for example is really good that I get on the daily. Other than that I get their juicy burgers.</Review>

Fish and chip with green tea for $22. It’s the only restaurant open in the whole block of this terminal during this pandemic time. So they take advantages with the prices.</text>

< review>
To be completely honest, I don't know why this place gets such a low rating both on Yelp and Google. It seems like a really popular spot, and everyone was going here, and not the next two spots. Now, as a Canadian I don't fully know what average price for breakfast food is, but since it is an airport, I will say that it is fairly reasonable. I ordered an omelette with sausage inside, with sides of toast, salsa, tater tots, and avocado. And with sour cream as dipping. Again, as a Canadian, I found the portions to be huge, and the price isn't bad(under 15 dollars). The service was nice, too. The lady at the counter walked us through the menu. The food was really good too, and they cook many things fresh.< /review>

30 MINUTES WAIT FOR A BOWL OF CLAM CHOWDER SOUP that only the cooks have the secret preparation of how to pour it in a bowl..... FOOD IS GOOD. but waiting time for just a bowl of clam chowder soup takes very very long wait. There were a line of orders ahead of me like burgers that needs to be cooked while the cashier and helpers were there when they can already help me and the cook to serve me my soup right after I paid. I also buy burgers here and I understand I have to wait for my turn. That was what 'Willow Street' was doing before. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME NOW. First time was after I paid, I asked the cashier that maybe she could serve me my soup already, it will only take a minute or less. She said "Cant you see there's a customer next to you? If there isnt, i will help you.".... But why is it  when you buy latte they would serve it to you right after you pay that takes longer than pouring soup in a bowl. Some restaurants are very considerate to SFO employees like me because they know we only have 30 minute lunch break. Sigh....</review>

By the time it arrived the chips were half cold, the fish was flaming hot, made it so I couldn't enjoy any of it but I didn't have time to let anything cool down since we were now having to dash to meet the people we were picking up.

Guys making the food seemed to spend most of the time arguing, very disappointing, remember it being both fast and tasty last time I was here< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Clam chowder is actually tepid celery soup. Hot dog served on some sort of flat bread. If you're looking for plain good food, or even food that looks like what they display on the menu, this isn't it.</review>

They forgot or skipped my order, soup bowl. Waited 20 mins and asked what was taking so long. They pretended they already placed it and someone must have took it (I hadnt left counter after ordering, no one did)...food itself was average and overpriced as all airport food but they could have been honest about losing my order and apologized at least.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Quick lunch, at an acceptable price, with minimal waiting time. Great for a light and quick lunch before embarking. I relied on the classic "fish and chips", good and well prepared

(Translated by Google) A very good burger restaurant, the buns are delicious, and you are even asked about the desired cooking level of the burger and you can even choose between different types of cheese for the cheeseburger.
In terms of price for the airport location also completely ok!

(Original)
Ein sehr gutes Burger-Restaurant, die Buns sind lecker, und man wird sogar nach der gewünschten Garstufe der Burger gefragt und kann beim Cheeseburger sogar zwischen verschiedenen Käsesorten wählen.
Preislich für die Flughafenlage auch völlig ok!</Text>

<text>This boat launch is short. It could handle 2 boats on 1 side. The boat launch has only 1 deck and the ramp is narrow. When the tide is low, it's very hard to launch boat because of shallow. It's usually a long line to launch boats during peak hours</text>< pics>

<Review>This is my main boat launch as I live nearby. There are two ramps. The north ramp is a little silted in. The kayaks and skiffs use this one. The south ramp is good for most shallow draft boats if you have a one foot plus tide at The Blakes Landing tide station. If your bringing your big Gradey White wait for plus two. It's a Marin County launch ramp. There are clean flush toilets and it's five bucks to launch and park. Over night parking is allowed if you are boat camping on the west side of the bay. The lower paved lot fills up pretty quick in the early morning. but there is a dirt lot up the hill for overflow. It's Grand Central Station when the bite is on and the kayak tours are running. There are always parking spots after Eleven a.m. No fuel but you can get some really excellent pricy food at Nick Cove. See you on the water.<//Review>< user>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>This is the main location were I launch my boat to fish Tomales Bay for Halibut. The mouth of the bay is great for Salmon when Salmon are running. For Halibut go to the back of the bay in about 12ft of water this is were I spearfish for California Halibut. I've bagged nice fish every time that I dive there.Visibility can be 20ft on a great day too zero on a heavy tide. A sandy rolling bottom is what you encounter. Expect Thresher Sharks , Leopard Sharks and Sting Rays. Not for beginners!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdxVla3ehSBpnpEmtN1FvvtYM0Djepgo3N-Bx4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe1k4oHswPc47O5GdC-fnElNAX68nUqtCKHlmW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Not the Boat ramps fault BUT, You MUST launch at a non low tide # 1 !!!!
# 2  VERY Disappointed in  Kayaking business down there. They obviously think that the ramp is all & only theirs !! Most rude & unprofessional boating  Etiquette!!!
#3 5$ fee doesn't make 1 of 20 " Boat/truck " parking spots available< /text>

One of the best to visit!!! We did a tour for bioluminescence and it was just out of the world. Very places on the earth where you see this. With the clear sky (milky way) on your head and still water with the small bacteria glowing lights. Cannot ask for a better place.<//text>

Good boat launch, well situated in front of sandy beaches and Hog Island.  Good amenities, and the Restaurant nearby is very friendly and let me use their land line when there was no cell coverage.   Launch point can get busy on week ends.</text>

<Text>Cheap parking and easy launch. Parking is limited and too much sludge on the right side of the boat ramp, so it is difficult to launch boat from right side. So stick to the left.< /Text>< rate>

< Review>
Perfect for my small 12' boat, but at low tide I wouldn't want to try to launch a larger craft.
Not a big parking area , so it can be tricky, speci aly on weekends.
The area is well maintained, thank you guys .<//Review>

Great launch but marked down for lack of parking. This launch has very limited parking. If you don't get there before sun up, it pretty likely you won't find parking<//review>

<Text>Nice boat launch facilities for Tomalas Bay. Parking will fill up by mid morning which can be a pain. Kayak rental people have customers park in the boat trailer parking taking up many spaces with a single car.< /Text>< Pics>

The Machaca con Huevo combination was awesome.  It’s not on the menu but they were happy to make it for me.< /Review>

<text>Just went to the new location of Puerto Vallarta restaurant in Calistoga. Definitely a downgrade from the previous place. Not much more than a hole in the wall. Dark and no air conditioning, and smelled old. Our table was very wobbly, the chips were stale, the "ice" water was warm and the server had really bad body odor. We almost walked out, but saw they had the same menu, so we ordered our old favorites, chicken sopes and tamales. The service was fast, but it was hard to enjoy the food. We ate some of it, then took a box to go. Don't think we will be going back.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><name>Linda Bowen< /name><Response>None</Response>< userid>

Last time I visited it was closed down. Sad face! But I was told the Mexican Market on 29 are the same people and you can order same food to go. I'll have to try that. Use to love their crispy tacos! Update, no you can NOT get their food at the Mexican Market on 29.<//review>

What used to be a great spot has gone downhill sadly. I ate the Michuacan style carnitas and sadly they were dry and tasteless. Carnitas in my experience are juicy with loads of flavor. Kids meal is $10 for a black bean and cheese burrito. It was no bigger than an iPhone no drink included or side just a small burrito. Sadly as a 5 year resident of Calistoga I will seek out a better place.<//review>

My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for nearly 20 years, with my parents, and their families, when they were in their former location down the street by Cal Mart. This is our favorite Mexican restaurant, and we are so excited that they have reopened. This place has the same great food and good service that we were accustomed to in their other location. While the room arrangement isn't as comfortable and cozy as their former location, come to enjoy the food.  Over the years, our family has sampled many dishes. Here are our favorites: the enchiladas or burrito, with sour cream, guacamole, creamy red sauce and juicy shredded chicken; the fajitas with perfectly sauteed red and green bell peppers; the tacos or tostada with fresh lettuce, tomato, and your choice of meat; the spicy camarones a la diabla that generous portion of succulent shrimp will not disappoint); or on the lighter side, have a perfectly cooked quesadilla or chile relleno. The beans and rice on the side are also worth a mention because they have a great texture and flavor, best I've had yet.< /text>

Great food.  I had the fajita combo and my wife had the enchilada and both were excellent.  Make sure to try a Michelada!< /Text>

<username>Charlee Arnett<//username><review>This will be the least expensive choice in the Napa Valley. Good "gringo" mexican food. I prefer something higher in spice but i wouldn't slam it for that.

Straight forward Mexican food, that is inexpensive. The quality is decent, nothing to write home about, but satisfying. The margaritas are made with wine not tequila.</text>

<text>One of our favorite spots for a quick and pleasant lunch or dinner. Just a few walkable blocks from home and next door to Cal Mart downtown. Excellent food and great value. Casual taqueria with made-from-scratch dishes. I recommend the tostadas de pescado and the chile verde - but I have never had anything from them that isn't really good representative taqueria food. We love to dine outside on the patio all year. Clean and friendly.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<text>I would give this store a 0 ! Ridiculous I called n they had me on hold for 30min then I called again & explained & was put on hold for another 15min & was told my request was “in stock” I drove up to only be pushed right out & said I had to call customer service. There in store customer service was already a ZERO. Did I forget to mention I run a Body Shop witch makes it 10 times more frustrating & so unprofessional. My apologies to my sales man who always visits my business more than once a month to sell me his products. I won’t be purchasing from this location for there customer service is all over the floor!! -MD AUTO BODY !</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808f866156c029dd:0x4fda8acad85b71a<//Gmap_id></record>

There were about 10+ employees there, only 3 helped customers.  The clerk that 'helped' me didn't have a clue.  3 simple parts: a powerstearing hose, transmission hose, and transmission repair kit.  1 hour!!!!! She went in the back and socialized, and laughed.  I don't complain much, but that experience was horrible!  I missed my appointment to pick up my transmission as a result.< /Text>

I was in the parking lot, they wouldn't help a female customer install a headlight, and they sold her the wrong headlight part. I work at Tesla and I was able to help their customer out. This is the worst customer service I've ever witnessed.< /text>

Easy place, checks in with you (if you need help) and attends to you (if you want it). Typically O'Reillys which is good! No hassle crew and doesn't bait me (read other reviews, specifically AutoZone where they tell me they have something but they don't).</Review>

<Text>I got my Peloton last May but immediately started experiencing knee pain. It wasn’t all the time, but occurred intermittently. A friend, who is a triathlete, suggested I get professionally fitted by Pedro.

We did the fitting via Zoom and he has such a lighthearted and friendly disposition that I felt totally comfortable and at ease right away.

He was so meticulous with my fitting and after a couple rides I noticed a significant difference. No more pressure on my knees. I also didn’t realize until AFTER the fitting that I had been putting a lot of pressure on my wrists and shoulders as well. I began to activate my muscles properly during my rides and have noticed increases strength, output, and muscular definition in the 6 weeks since my fitting. I have recommended him to everyone I know and I am so grateful for the experience. I would give him 10 stars if I could!<//Text>< username>

Epic spot with good tunes and sweet vibe. Pedro is a really cool dude with tons of enthusiasm for people, community, and the sport. He worked with me to find a fit on my bike that suits my riding style and where I want to be. Absolutely recommending this to my friends and family.< /text>

I purchased my first road bike 5 months ago, had my first professional fit done and it was one of the best experiences of my life! Pedro is so humble yet so knowledgeable and comes with a high level of expertise. Pedro exudes confidence, works with what you have, has years of experience, he was professional, charismatic, efficient, and warm. Made the experience worth the 3 month wait to get in with him. I rode my bike the day after the fit and it was a night and day difference. My body does not ache and the ride felt a lot smoother, powerful, and efficient! I wish I could give him 10 stars!!! Def recomen him and I am def going back to him for my bike needs!!!</Text>

Like many others, I started biking more frequently during the pandemic, and it was great exercise! After I got my new Specialized Roubaix, my left knee started to feel some pains at the end of my longer rides (paradise loop, King's mountain, etc). I tried adjusting the seat/cleats on my own with the help of YouTube, but the pain only lessened slightly and shifted to other parts of my knee. My friends recommended Pedro, and I was hesitant due to the cost, but I'm glad I signed up!

The office is in a nice location in the Marina, and Pedro was welcoming and super easy to talk to. He looked at my cleats and asked who installed them *smirked and said I did*. I then sat on my bike while on the Wahoo and pedaled while he made adjustments. Pedro adjusted my handlebars, seat position, and even adjusted the hoods closer to be more in line with my shoulder width. The bike fit was a simple process and I actually wished it lasted more than an hour so I could continue chatting with him. Since the adjustments, I have had ZERO knee pain, absolutely none! According to his data, I was also able to have more efficiency in my riding.

If you're having some pains or feel like your fit is not great, and you're not comfortable adjusting the bike yourself, I highly recommend going to Pedro for a fit. Your body is worth the few hundred dollars to ensure there is no long term injury.</review>

Do you struggle from time to time with motivating yourself to stick to a consistent bike riding excersise routine?

Go easy on yourself, it maybe your body is telling you that it is tired of compensating for a unfitted bike and is being needlessly over worked?

I have been riding Mountains for over 25 years and in today’s market, it is not uncommon to spend $7k - 10k on a full suspension carbon bike!

Even if your Budget is much less, at any scale, fitting a bike will be the most important thing you do to owning a bicycle!

Yet most Bike shops do not spend the time nor have a dedicated resource who are trained to fit your new/old ride for maximum performance and ultimate enjoyment!

Pedro’s Bike Fitting is a full concierge Service well known to Professional Athletes and can custom fit your ride like the most comfortable shoes you own!

Recently He custom fitted me to my Mountain Bike that was newly purchased 6 months ago. I was amazed of the adjustments he had made. It enabled me to deliver unbelievable performance way beyond my wildest expectations. And His expertise and attention to personal details on how and why I like to ride has renewed my love for the sport!

Next time you consider buying another component for you bike or an accessory that you think you need, think again and spend your money wisely; enhance your riding experience and smoke your competition -CUSTOM FIT by Pedro’s Custom Bike Fitting, the best investment money can buy!<//Text>

<Text>I proposed that Pedro should be ordained a Saint, St. Pedro sounds better. He literally saved me from bad posture and fitting that caused endless neck and shoulder pain, not to mention other injuries.

From the first day I can already see my times getting better, my body getting stronger and over the course of a few weeks, I am comfortable on the bike again.

I recommend a bike fitting - in general - now to everyone. No matter what kind of riding you do, this is an investment in your health and will save you a lot of money on the long run.
P-Fits, on the other hand, is a very special experience. I like the dude, I love his workspace, his dog, and enjoy the work he does; the personalized service, care, meticulousness. Cannot recommend P-Fits enough. if you are in San Francisco, or near by and looking for a bike fit, look no more, you won't get a better service.
I just got a new bike and going for another fit soon.<//Text>< Pics>

I'm glad I got dialed in by a "real cyclist" and not just any plug and play, computerized bike fit. Finding your fitment range on your bike takes many trial... With Pedro, you're not just paying for a 80 minutes session. You get fitted by a legit cyclist with many years of experience in bike fitting that can tune in your bike to a better riding position in 80 minutes or less. I cycle 50-60 miles mix terrain road 2x a week. After getting fitted by Pedro, my bike ride feels a lot better, and my moving time on the bike is faster. My average speed is better, and I feel less pain after every ride. I'm thankful I got fitted by Pedro.

<rating>2</rating><Review>I usually don't like to leave bad reviews but in this case I do want to share my experience. I got a flat tire on my bike and found that this bike shop was the closest and easy to get to by foot. The person there, which I see in some pictures, did not help me because I hadn't made an appointment. I understand that he had a schedule to follow but taking 10-12 minutes to change a flat tire shouldn't collapse that schedule, there wasn't a train schedule involved. To me this is more about customer service, wanting to help each other, adapt, be flexible and not so squared minded. I expect people that usually work at bike shops to share my passion and be cyclists as well. So to me this was about helping us cyclists. At the end, this was a terrible experience for me!

I would recommend asking for customer service advice to Alex at his neighbor store Unlimited Biking. Despite of not having the tooling to fix a flat tire, he suggested places nearby, inflate my tire and smiled.< /Review>< pics>

{'time': 1596668723595, 'text': "Hi Mariano. Thank you for this review. Sorry that I didn't STOP what I was doing to help you while I was with a client that booked me 3 weeks back that expect all of my time and attention. Bike Fitting is pretty technical and needs full attention without disruptions, if I miss a step during the process then it may become an issue.  Sorry that I can't make everyone happy. I am just one person that mainly focuses on Bike Fittings. And YOU ARE wrong, 10-12min to fix a flat is not the usual time, issues may come up and it may take longer. And Mariano, next time you plan to ride your bike outside, please make sure you have all the proper tools, pump, and a spare tube-if you don't know how to change a flat, then schedule a time with me and I can teach you."}<//Resp>

Bike fitting is personal and essential, and always should be done by a true proffesional like Pedro. I have adjusted my bike by myself before, but never could get bike dialed in properly. Those small changes make huge difference. After fitted by Pedro, shoulder pain is gone, knee pain is gone. I even managed get a right saddle for myself, after like 20ish trial. He is also responsive, every time I messaged him. Great work!</review>< user>

<Text>Not sure I can add to all the incredible reviews above except I was able to schedule a ZOOM fit of my Peloton from Texas.

Shoulder pain, hip pain -> adios!

He is extremely professional, yet amazingly easy to chat with.  More than just technical, he was able to explain the rationale for each change he made to my bike.

If you're thinking about a bike fit - don't hesitate anymore.  Pedro is the real deal!!< /Text><user_name>Kevin Madden</user_name><Response>None</Response>< Date>

Pedro is legit. First thing I do when I get a new bike is to take it straight to him for a fitting. Went in a couple days ago to get my most recent bike fit, and I couldn't be happier. Over the course of a 90 min session Pedro was able to make various adjustments that led to a 10% increase in my power efficiency. His fittings are the best "upgrade" money I spend on my bikes, period. Beyond that, he's a genuinely nice guy and a pleasure to talk to.</Text>

Consummate professional/legend and a wiz at what he does. Thanks Pedro for setting me up on my road bike and getting me squared away on everything including my bike, positioning, cleats, and saddle.

Deserves the 5 stars and more for the bike fit. 10 stars for the sense of humor and being an all around good guy.

Will definitely come back for my next bike/fitting.</text>

< Review>
Pedro was highly recommended by many pro-level riders but his prices are comparable to a bike shop fitting. I'm a casual rider but felt I was given the same attention and level of service as any of his pro clients. I thought a fitting for my new bike might result in a subtle change, but the results were dramatic - it feels transformed and I'm now able to do longer rides faster and with more comfort.< /Review>

<name>Ryan Devens</name><Text>There are “great” experiences and there are “genuinely great” experiences. Pedro is a master of the latter.

His candor is real and truly friendly as he begins to assess the work that needs to be done. You can immediately tell that Pedro didn’t begin a business only to deliver a superior bike-fitting service. He exists to serve others in a self-sacrificing way that left me feeling very cared-for and considered every step of the way.

He makes it super easy to communicate what you need in a fit while watching your power levels fluctuate with each tweak on the screen in front of you.

The countless other 5-star reviews aren’t a coincidence. When someone cares as much as Pedro does about his craft and also for those who are interested in the services he provides, the result is a 5-star experience that IS something to write home about.

Excited to keep refining my fit with Pedro into the future.</Text><response>None< /response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

<Text>I went in for a fitting in May while training for my first triathlon and my only regret is that I didn't go sooner! I am a cycling rookie and thought that I didn't really need to get my bike fit, but it has really made all the difference. I can't believe a waited over a year to see Pedro.

Pedro is super knowledgeable and methodical. He was patient with my questions, taught me all about biomechanics and how we were going to set my bike up for a more efficient ride. After replacing my handlebars and stem, I feel so much more comfortable (no more upper back/neck pain!) and in control.

Go see Pedro! It's 1000% worth it!<//Text>< pics>

I have been going to Pedro for a year or so now. He does a great job fitting my road bike. He also fits tri bikes as well. His prices are very reasonable and he services LA in addition to SF. He also very helpful should you have questions regarding your bike. Highly recommend him!</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I had been racing triathlons for a few years before I came to be fitted on my bike by Pedro, and never knew what I was missing out on in terms of comfort, efficiency, and potential power until that point!

Pedro is an expert in the field, professional, fun to work with, and not only works with you to find optimal fit on your bike, but helps you understand the reasoning behind what he is doing as well.

I’ve been able to take my biking to the next level with Pedro’s help. I would highly recommended seeking out a fit with Pedro not only for those competing, but also for casual cyclists looking for comfort and to prevent injury. Added bonus: his studio/office is a sweet set-up too.</text>< pics>

<Review>Like watching a surgeon work! Pedro is knowledgeable, considerate and understanding, and I'll go see him again. I initially went for an adjustment to my saddle fit, and like magic, he diagnosed and fixed the issue without any fuss. He has since helped me with new handlebars and some riding advice. I highly recommend him.<//Review>< user_name>

Pedro is a master at fitting folks on the bicycle. His attention to detail and care was very much appreciated. Since I was from out of town, he went the extra mile to help me out with my cleats. My knees and body feel great thanks to a great bike fit! Thanks again and highly recommend P-fits :)<//review>

<Text>Very pleased with the fit I received from Pedro! I've been twice, once for a full fitting and once for an adjustment of the initial fit. I had maxed out my old seatpost and Pedro walked me through my options...I ended up getting a longer seatpost and had him adjust the fit as well as put me into a more aggressive aero position. I would highly recommend and will be going back for fitting future bikes or adjustments as needed.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I went to Pedro in SF to get a Peloton fitting, and measurements as I'm planning to buy a road bike soon. He was clearly very experienced and easy to talk to. He aligned my cleats (I had them too far back), helped me find the best seat and handlebar positions (my handlebars were way too high), and what a good posture looks like (I had my hands in the wrong place). Immediately after the session he sent me pictures of all the settings and an email with all of my measurements.

I participated in a 120 "mile" Pelofondo that same weekend over the course of 5.5 hours in one day with no problem (more than twice as long as my previous longest session or highest "mileage"). Today, a week after the fitting, I just set a new 45 min PR basically by accident and I think my FTP is going to see a double digit improvement. I would 100% recommend Pedro to anyone who is serious about riding, and I look forward to seeing him again when I buy a new bike. Even indoors, fit and posture really does make a big difference.</Review>

What can I say? The best bang for your buck!

Not only Pedro is professional, knowledgeable and friendly...

You will actually feel the difference once you go out riding, you won't be exhausted with post ride pain, you will feel comfortable and best of all you don't want to get off the bike!

His fit changed my riding and my body is now improving in the current fit.</Text>

< Review>
I got a new Tri bike that I had been riding for six months preparing for my first 70.3.  I did get a retul fit from the seller but it ended up being quite an aggressive fit for me and I ended up with shoulder and elbow discomfort especially on my long rides.  A few weeks before the race I had Pedro do a thorough refit for me including adjusting my cleats (which had been off as well).  I just finished my first 70.3 La Quinta Half-Ironman and my bike course ride was the best of the three disciplines.  I had zero discomfort and could breathe better and ride faster (0.5 mph) pushing slightly more watts that I could during my race rehearsals in similar conditions before the refit.  Thank you Pedro!  Pedro listens and understands your needs and is very detailed in getting you the right fit to make sure your goals and needs are met above and beyond your expectations.< /Review>

I am not sure I can put into words how much my fit with Pedro changed my cycling. I literally went from liking it to absolutely loving it. I gained comfort, power and efficiency to the point my first ride was almost double the length and a few mph faster average with less effort and discomfort.
Getting a fit from Pedro is worth every penny he charges and more.< /Review>

I'm an All American triathlete and duathlete and made Team USA in 2017.  In search of additional speed, this year, I went to Pedro for a new bike fit.  I found it--both my bike and run times improved.  Unbelievable.

Pedro is a pro and we all know it.  Anyone and everyone who have been in the fit community for a while here in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area and who has his or her ear to the ground knows that Pedro is simply the best.  So don't just take my word for it, ask around about Pedro, or just take a look at his perfect 5/5 stars out of 92 reviews on Yelp. ;-)

Pedro is professional and use state of the art equipment and technology.  He's an educated guy and comes from a point of significant knowledge as well as experience.  Pedro has offices in SF, LA and NYC.

Go and meet him in person.  Pedro is impressive.  Highly recommended.  Two big thumbs up.</text>

<text>I visited Pedro for a fit after struggling with some knee pain over the past few months. I have not had a proper bike fit in a very long time and the results were transformational. My ride the day after the fit was amazing. I’m in a much more efficient position and out of pain. Pedro really knows what he is doing and takes the time to dial things in iteratively so by the end of the session you really are dialed in.

I appreciate this kind of service and knowledge without relying on gimmicks.

It also helps that Pedro is a super nice guy and has good taste in bikes:-).</text><Date>1533421638038<//Date>< Resp>

I just got my fitting done today by Pedro and it was such a great experience from start to finish. He is very knowledgeable, down to earth and cool person. I've been riding for a few years now and this is the first time I got professionally fitted. My only regret is not getting this performed a lot sooner. I highly suggest for any cyclist to quit doing the guess work and do it the right/healthy way, go see Pedro!< /Review>

have been using Pedro for bike fits for the last 3 years.  Having using other services in the past, I can say that Pedro is night and day compared to others.  He has the crazy ability to dial in a fit with the tiniest of adjustments that produce huge results.  I recently had him do a pre-race check given that I had lost weight.  The adjustment clearly helped to perfect my fit which allowed for an awesome race.  My power output exceeded my expectation with a much lower perceived effort.  I also transitioned from my bike to run fresher than I ever have as well.  I will continue to bring all of my bikes to Pedro to ensure I have the best fit possible.  Thank you Sir for all that you do!!<//text>

Pedro is a bike sorcerer.  I didn't even realize how much room for improvement there was on my bike and cleats until he got his hands on them.  But after a single session, all of the little aches and pains I'd just gotten used to are gone, my pedal stroke feels so much stronger, and I'm super comfortable on all kinds of terrrain.  Before the fit, I used to have to move around a lot, shake out my arms, and sit up to ease tension in my lower back if I was on the bike for more than 2 hours - especially if the route was hilly or headwinds were strong.  Last weekend, I did a hilly and windy ride and didn't even think about my position.  Almost shed a little tear of gratitude at the end, when I realized it. Oh, and I'm faster, too!  Pedro's fit is worth every penny.  Plus, he is a gem:  professional and efficient, but friendly, full of jokes, and totally not judgmental about how little I knew about how the bike should feel.  Go get yourself some bike fit magic!!< /text>

<review>Pedro is one of the best in town in the bike fitting game. I have been to few fitters in the past none like Pedro before I felt comfortable with my bike while pushing the boundaries of myself and the bike. The biggest thing that matters on a bike is the rider and they need the bike to help them in the process.
I moved from a slow casual rider to a pretty fast paced rider and developed a hunger for racing. I'll be racing pretty soon (training hard with Trainer Road and racing with local racers) consensus among my fellow racers is to get a good fit as they can see my discomfort on it while racing. Bike fits before Pedro did not give me that much in terms of what I can achieve. So I started looking for new bike fitter and found P-fits based on reviews and recommendations from few racers. I did my fitting with Pedro one in March and a follow up this June.

After 2 sessions with Pedro my bike feels an extension of myself and I've been pushing the limits of my current fitness and going into new levels that I didn't think I could. I'm stretched out and in aero position (Road bike) but more comfortable than ever before, that only quality fitters can deliver....that's all I've to say from my experience. Do yourself a favor and get fitted already 😁😁 😁 ...</review>< Pics>

Pedro came to me highly recommended after being referred to him by three different people.

He is not only professionally but warm, welcoming and very approachable. After purchasing a TT bike for my first triathlon, not only did he fit me perfectly, but he made me feel I could ask any question and lean on him for advice. He is a wonderful resource and I truly felt more at ease come race day because of his help.

Pedro is the best! Whether you are new to biking or a seasoned athlete, Pedro does not disappoint.</Text>

Pedro is terrific. I'm a pretty experienced cyclist; experienced enough to think I know more about bike fit than I actually do. I'm training for my 19th ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Although I love my bike I've been aware for some time that the fit could stand to be improved and things had gotten to a point where I could no longer ignore the shortcomings.
From the moment I walked into the studio, Pedro was on it; we looked at cleat position, seat position and hand position. He reminded me that my core, not my arms, is what should be holding my body in position. He made a few changes--far fewer in fact that I'd been expecting. After three rides I can say that the improvement is remarkable. I no longer have neck pain after a ride. My arms aren't sore. Pedro promised to make me a faster rider and I think he's succeeded.< /Text>

<review>Pedro is great! I went to Pedro for a fitting after having a knee issue while riding. One year and a couple hundred miles later, I haven't had any knee issues after being fitted by Pedro, and I went in for a follow up fitting to fine tune adjustments before a century ride. Pedro is super knowledgable, friendly, and 100% worth the visits for me. I highly recommend getting fitted by Pedro!</review></record>

<review>Well, let me start by telling you that I am the skeptical type. I had a basic fit when I purchased a bike a couple years ago and thought it was good but nothing close to life changing (life on the bike I mean). I ended up deciding to look for a top experience for my new bike and Pedro was highly recommended.

And this is where my skepticism disappeared. Pedro was both personally and professionally amazing. Explaining every single detail of everything he did, providing tips on how to maximize the power and the experience on the saddle...

I am not kidding, I didn't have any pain or any major issues before I went to Pedro, so I never thought that I would be "overwhelmed" by the fit...What happened blew my mind, I have more power with less effort, my pedal stroke is smoother and lighter, my "aero" position on the drops is more comfortable and the most impressive thing is how my deep breathing improved so drastically.

Try it out, you won't regret it.<//review><UserId.>110745782029100679006< /UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

<text>Pedro is the best of the best! If anyone is looking into getting a professional bike fit, he is definitely the go-to person.  I was suffering from a stiff neck and shoulder pains.  Through my triathlon club recommendation as well as word of mouth I found Pedro.  Boy did the fitting make a difference!!!  The pain was gone and I was able to ride with a lot more efficiency.

Pedro is very knowledgeable, caring and helpful.  I was able to stay injury free through my training hugely because of him!  Thank you Pedro!!!<//text><gmapID>0x808580f9d6430449:0x5153253285b7edec< /gmapID>< pictures>

Pedro works some magic. I was having some leg issues when I went in, but thought I had a pretty good setup going on. He took a bunch of measurements, asked a lot of questions about the style of riding that I do, and then he went to work. Things felt pretty good when I left, but I had no idea how good. I just got back from a century ride yesterday. Spent almost the entire six hours in the drops. Absolutely no soreness in my legs or anywhere else in my body during the ride or the morning after. I somehow felt better than I did doing 30 milers before the fit. Couldn't be happier. For those who aren't sure if you need a fitting like I was: trust me, get a fit.<//Review>

Don't assume this service is reserved only for professionals, I would say this is a must-do for anyone spending any significant amount of time on a bike  - and Pedro is a master.
After a short session and a few tweaks I was amazed at how much more comfortable I felt on my road bike along with a significant power improvement, I cannot recommend him enough!<//review>

Ever since I started working with Pedro, my bike times at half ironman have gone from 2:20s to 2:09s. I owe most of that improvement to Pedro. Pedro always does what's best for you as an athlete. He recommends the best products for you personally, no specific brands. And he progresses your position over time so your body adapts to the most optimal position. i gurantee you will smile every time you get on your bike after you're fitted by Pedro!<//review>< pictures>

It is my 3rd visit to Pedro for bike fitting over the years: I always ride away amazed by the care he takes of me and the bike. He checks and adjusts everything with extreme care: he explains the reason for certain choices and recommendations. Good for road or triathlon biking (he races both), good if you are pro or beginner, Pedro will optimize your bike and posture based on your biking style, goals and physical type. I know I can trust his advice when he pushes back on my weird requests. My riding always improves after a P-fits visit (that neck or shoulder pain, and that gain in comfort and extra-power). Highly recommended!!! Go Pedro!<//text>

Pedro is awesome - a true 'bike whisperer' who transformed my bike fit into a much more efficient/comfortable set-up without any extra fittings ...just by measuring and tweaking. He is very knowledgeable and friendly to work with. Pedro has also helped me with buying a new bike. He rocks !</text>

I have been racing triathlon, specifically olympic distance and IM 70.3 for the past 4-5 years. Always feeling not ideal on my tri bike position after many many tweaks, did an expensive fitting with another shop in SF about 2 years ago, still not helping much. My main struggling are 1) not able to apply glute strength enough; 2) upper body either too straight or too stretch; 3) suffering a lot of quad cramping immediately after T2 for 70.3 races.

A friend of mine introduced me to Pedro earlier this year, I wasn't sure it would help at first but decided to give it a try. Went to the shop for a new fitting (because I want him to have a completely new look into it), it 3 weeks before my first 70.3 races this year, Pedro listened to my above issues to start with, and looked into my position on the trainer and immediately gave a few recommendation. We worked on it step by steps in the next 1.5 hours; every adjustment he made, we either see some immediate improvements on the power output or discuss over the difference on feelings, he took my feedback very well and incorporated into the further steps. After the session I felt pretty happy and confident about the above problems being mostly fixed.

I raced two 70.3 races after the fitting, feeling much better on the tri-position, didn't have cramping problem in the entire run on both occasions. Glad the new fitting is proven in the real world as well. Now i'm looking forward to the next season, very sure it would be even better once i spend majority of the training on the position. I will definitely go back to Pedro for a few follow-up fittings as well.

Also additional note: he didn't upsell unnecessary components to me like some other fitting shops.< /review>

<Text>Pedro is world-class. He's super thoughtful, brings tons of passion to his work, and -- maybe most importantly -- is a fun guy to get to know.

I've been a cyclist for most of my life and I've never invested in a proper bike fit. Pedro helped dial in my Colnago E1 (which I already loved to ride) and made it a different -- and better -- bike. My efficiency, power, and recovery quality have all improved. I wish I'd had a fit session with Pedro 10 years ago...

Many probably might not know this, but Pedro is also an Argon 18 dealer (I think he may be the only one in San Francisco as of the date of this review). He recently sold me 2018 Argon 18 E-117 tri + for my TT set up. Now I'm enjoying Di2 components and a super fast bike -- Pedro has also fitted me on that and I've got the same 110% positive experience with this machine :)

Check out Pedro's new space in the Marina! You won't be disappointed!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808580f9d6430449:0x5153253285b7edec</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had been experiencing several aches and pains on my tri bike, and some total leg numbness going into the run at races. I dropped in to get a fit by Pedro, and raced my first full Ironman just one month later. I had ZERO pain, and zero numbness during my Ironman and even after! I was able to stay aero for 6hours and never stopped on the bike or the run! Highly recommend!!!<//Text>

< review>
I've had my Felt IA-16 tri bike for a year.  I did get a pre-purchase fit as well as a fit when I picked the bike up.  It felt pretty good at the time and I really didn't ride it nearly as much as I planned to.
I recently started training to enter into some triathlons so I am starting to ride more and found that it really wasn't as comfortable as I had first thought.
The coach I am working with sent out a notification that Pedro was coming to SoCal for a few days and was taking appointments for fittings.
I set up a time and when I arrived, before I even took the bike out of my car, Pedro looked at me and asked why I was riding it like a road bike.
I was a little surprised he noticed that right off.
Needless to say, Pedro made a few key adjustments and it was amazing how much better it felt.  A couple more tweaks here and there and we were done.
Pedro is very knowledgeable, personable, and all around fun to talk with.
I took the bike for a good 2 hour ride the next day and was so impressed with the new fit.
I was able to stay in the saddle and in aero much longer than I had before and I could breathe.
I would recommend Pedro to anyone for a fitting, whether you think you need it or not.
I will definitely be seeing him again whenever he is in the Los Angeles area.< /review>

<review>The process for the cost from Moving Nation was its saving grace. They did not charge me much more than originally quoted, however, the real issues were in the actual moving/packing and unpacking. As I've been unpacking, I noticed that despite being wrapped in bubble wrap, a number of my pots and pans had deep scratches on them, which at least they weren't on the inside of the pan where you actually cook, but still diminishes the quality of the cookware. They also put our Ikea bedframe back together wrong, so in the middle of the night one evening, we heard a loud noise, and then looked the next day and saw that the metal bar sections had not been properly screwed in, so we ended up having to reconstruct it properly. We also notice quote a bit of damage on that, despite the frame being only a couple years old. They also asked to throw away a bunch of plastic packing wrap, to which I thought they would throw it in the trash can, but instead, they put it in recycling, which is wrong. Lastly, there was a bit of a language barrier. I know moving is hard work, and I wasn't standing over them watching every move as they originally packed our furniture, so when they delivered it, they wheeled it in asking me where to put some of it, and I didn't know what it was, to which they got frustrated with me. The language barrier definitely made that part worse. I get that these guys are stressed, (they under-calculated how far our city was from another job in a different city, and seemed to be rushing to complete our job so they could make it back to the other one), but clearer communication, and better common sense would have helped this. Would I use them again? Probably not. I was quoted a similar price with another company, and probably should have gone with them.< /review><GmapID>0x809adbf88b9425f3:0x7c86151f0da49036</GmapID><Response>None</Response></record>

<review>My poor niece, who is a recent widow and has a 7 year old daughter, hired these people to move hoer to Portland. They gave her one price at signing and another after they loaded her things. Now they want $5000 more to actually give her her furniture and other goods. Unfortunately she also packed some important papers in with the furniture and she needs them to continue the suit with the County and the death of her husband. He was a Federal policeman, a great guy and missed greatly by his wife and daughter. We don't have the money to pay the ransom that they are charging. Have no idea what to do now. Any help appreciated.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>TLDR: Do not book with this company! Unprofessional, uncommunicative, and almost a month late.

We booked a move for 10/23 and The sales rep that I initially spoke with told me that our order would be delivered between 11/3 and 11/9. He then walked through the contract with me over the phone while I digitally signed it. During that section he said “this is what we discussed”. I understand it is on me to have read the contract more thoroughly but I feel it was very deceptive. The actual timeline was 17 business days from our first available date, which would be 11/24.

We got a call a day before they were supposed to be there and were told that they would be coming on our backup day, a day later than expected. Our things left our San Francisco apartment on 10/24. When they movers were in our apartment they were very unprofessional. The leader repeatedly took his mask off even when I asked him to keep it on at all times (locally it is required to keep masks on indoors and outdoors). When disassembling our furniture for packing, one of the movers did not know what a screwdriver was (picked up a socket wrench and asked me if that was a screwdriver). We also found several screws and washers on the floor after they had packed and left, so we had to save the hardware pieces for our bed.

Over the month of November we called frequently but were not able to get updates. We were told that our things left the California warehouse on 11/23, the day before the end of our delivery window for a cross country move, so clearly they had no intention of making the deadline. It was then delayed again indefinitely due to mechanical issues and we couldn’t get a callback or any information regarding our timeline.

We had given up on seeing our possessions again by December and had started to look into possible legal action.

We finally received our things on 12/19, nearly 2 months after it left.

We were given a refund of $30/business day over the window, but this was a very small refund. Very upset because we were missing our possessions 7 days a week, not just week days, and $30/day is not enough to make up for the lost time.

When our things did arrive we were not missing anything, only one item was slightly damaged and the movers on the move-in end were very professional and courteous, but this is the only good thing I can say about the company.</text>< Pics>

You can't go wrong if you hire these guys. They know their jobs, have all the right equipment and operate a fleet of well-maintained vehicles. I have seen this for myself, having used them 3 times now. No problems recommending them to anyone.</text>

This company is a total fraud; they will be at your feet until you pay the initial deposit and once done it will be total harassment from that point on. They provided us a binding estimate based on our inventory list. On the day of the move, they load half of the truck and then harassed us to pay another $1800  though we did not deviate from our original inventory list and actually removed items(exercise bike, garage cabinet, queen and full mattress) incurring further losses in addition to damaging the wall in the house and the door siding. The items were delivered after a week for a 750 mile delivery and the items arrived damaged. I have been emailing the company since the move with the most recent one being attaching pics of the damaged items but I have not received a response till date. Attaching pics to this review.

Hello dear reader, I pray listen well –
and bear ye witness to my tale of woe;
of movers whose help was a living hell,
and for whom there is no rating too low.

My ask was simply to just use one truck,
and to this one request they did agree.
But once cash changed hands, I was out of luck;
instead of one truck, they would now use three.

I wish this lie would also be the last,
But beyond lying, they also weren’t fast.

I called to complain, three trucks would not do.
“Too bad,” they said, “you signed and you agreed.”
What their salesman said mattered not, I knew,
Phone conversations leave nothing to read.

Lo, they did say they recorded all calls!
So I bid them play our conversation,
And hoped they did not have me by the balls.
But, alas, I found more consternation.

The files, it seemed, were all there - except one.
“It’s unplayable,” claimed Moving Nation.

Three hours we spent, arguing on the phone;
But customer service refused our pleas.
“We’ve got you now,” said the rep’s icy tone,
“You’ve no choice but to pay our surprise fees.”

At this point despair started to begin.
With less than seven days until the move,
Our contract made it clear - we were locked in.
We told ourselves things can only improve.

Unfortunately, this was just the start.
There’s worse yet to come, but that’s the next part.

At least the movers came on the right date,
Though they did give a two hour time line,
And arrived forty and five minutes late.
They packed our things, and again made us sign.

We should have known, by this point in the tale,
To expect trickery to be in play,
They used fine print to change the terms of sale,
And increased costs which we then had to pay.

“The worst’s done,” we thought, but we were naïve.
Now they had our stuff. There’d be no reprieve.

Moved into our new place, yet without stuff.
We called about our delivery date.
As you expect, the news we got was rough.
Our things may come up to thirty days late!

Ten days, contract said - thirty's too delayed!
But no, the fine print snuck something in deep.
Their receipt stated, beyond that we paid,
“ONE MONTH ‘fore we’d have our bed back to sleep.”

Cared not what they said during their sales pitch
It’s just their M.O. to bait and then switch.

Disney was planned, but they cared not for me.
Asked if they expected us to postpone,
They said, “Hope not,” but gave no guarantee.
They told me that one reaps what they have sewn.

A month passed us, without our clothes or bed.
Phone calls showed they did not know when they’d come.
By now our hope for good service was dead.
Completely at their mercy, we were glum.

Fearing that they might want to punish us,
We grew meek, and did not  put up a fuss.

Finally, our delivery day came.
It arrived over three hours late, mind you -
but of course they did not accept the blame
At least no shuttle was needed; that’s true.

Our fragile boxes all came rather squished.
Our bed and chairs were, of course, broken too.
They told us to report it if we wished.
WE would report it, to them and to you.

So noble reader, we draw near the end,
But don’t leave ‘fore I tell you of my friend.

This tale does not end with me and my things,
It’s not just me that was duped by these crooks.
They lost my wife’s crafting box and some strings,
And gave us someone else’s photo books.

Some wedding pictures, and a child’s first steps,
All of this left with us without a thought.
We found names and called the company reps,
We knew the owners must be quite distraught.

Moving Nation did nothing; one more fail.
We found the owners, and sent it by mail.

And so it ends, this moving tale of woe,
With every moving fear all come true,
My things broken and lost; my spirits low,
Few recourse options, but I could review!

Please heed my warning, whoever you are,
Do not listen to their saccharin lies
For the worst; Moving Nation sets the bar.
It was so bad, I hope their business dies.

I have nothing more to say or to tell.
Moving Nation, you can go straight to hell!</Text>

This company is a train wreck. Their sales department is great… But that’s about it. Customer service is a nightmare and nonexistent… If you can get through to them. Tomorrow will be a week since they picked up my stuff And I still have no idea when I will receive my things. Tina in customer service tells me I’ll get a phone call sometime in the middle of the wee to let me know when delivery will be. The only problem with that is Tina has never followed up on a phone call yet. At this point I feel my stuff is being held hostage by a group of inept disorganized unprofessional thieves. I don’t understand how this company has gotten so many good reviews on Google...  The reviews on Facebook are something I should’ve read before I hired them because those reviews make me feel like I am going to have to be filing a complaint with an AG or Better Business Bureau or something. So far, hiring them was the worst decision of my move and I regret it already immensely</Text>

<text>Save yourself. Don’t believe the 5 star reviews, and DO NOT use this company.  I’m SURE they pay people to post those 5 stars.... We had all the same issues mentioned in the 1 star reviews. Great sales guy, then terrible communication. They don’t answer the phone. No confirmation they’re even showing up to pack until the day before. Even though we purged a ton from what was originally included in our estimate, that estimate increased $7K by the time they finished packing up the moving trucks.

That was six weeks ago, and our belongings are still in California. Tina, the only customer service rep they have, has told us every week for the past 4 weeks that our things will be packed on a truck and ship out the following week. Tina has zero empathy and very obviously screens phone calls.

And here we sit and wait in our empty new home, with three small children. I’m losing my mind trying to keep everything going. It’s demoralizing, and I feel our only recourse is to involve our attorney.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Text>No doubt the most satisfying move I have ever had done. The team arrived on time, worked round the clock to get the house packed and did a fantastic job of packing and securing everything in the van.

This company is currently holding the possessions of a disabled military veteran hostage. The refuse to return his belongings unless he pay them in full, despite the fact that they are not months beyond the agreed upon arrival period. The didn't contact or return the calls, emails and messages he left them for months. No information or updates were given. Now they are threatening to sell off his things if he doesn't pay, though they are the ones in breach of contract. Absolutely disgusting, unprofessional, unethical, immoral and illegal. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY.< /Text>

A lot of companies claim to be the best. However, my personal experience with 7 moves under my belt says that Moving Nation is the best choice, hands down. They are a bit pricier than the regular movers but it is worth the money, believe me.<//review>

<review>My experience with Moving Nation is pretty much in line with all the other positive reviewers here. This is a company that treats its clients right and does a good job of delivering great service but still keeping costs reasonable. You will pay a bit more than you would for some other movers but the quality difference is really stark. You can tell pretty much from the first look their trucks are new, uniforms are clean, the way they speak is professional. Just a very good company from the get go. Use them.<//review>< Pics>

A happy, hardworking pair of movers that managed to do a perfect job with moving a huge house and the mountain of stuff in it to California. I have never been happier using a moving service and recommend this company very strongly.< /review>

< Review>
Our move of a two bedroom house from Atlanta to Dallas might sound like a small job but it all added up to literally almost a ton of stuff, including my husband’s tools. There was no question about doing it ourselves because we simply didn’t have the ability. Enter Moving Nation with their lovely team of movers and packers who got the whole job done in a jiffy, all padded and loaded. We have not checked every single thing yet but it seems like it all got here without any damage. Great work by all involved.</Review>

If you are looking for consistently good movers who take their job seriously, Moving Nation is the first and last option you need to consider. I have used them for more than a dozen moves going back years and they have proven themselves time and again. If you have no idea about moving and are flying blind, you can do all your hours of research and come to the same conclusion that I can just give you right now ñ this is the best moving company. Save yourself a lot of time and effort and just hire them.< /review>

Horrible experience for  a partner of mine, Rob.  CA to NC bid started with great sales pitch and $5,000 quote.  Like other honest reviews, they are still wondering 22 days later where is the household goods and why is it $15,000.  No customer service, no communication, no transparency and no honesty.  Involving attorney now, but still in darkness on arrival of goods.</review>

I am a first-time reviewer who is writing this because he is completely satisfied with the speed and professionalism of Moving Nation. They have restored my faith in movers after a couple of disastrous moves with other companies in the past. I won't be using any other company so long as these guys are around.</review>

I wish I could give them zero stars. You will regret it if you choose this company. Please beware. Everything the other one star reviews said are true and exactly what happened to me. You can’t get through to customer service. You can call all day. Then Tina (if she answers) puts you on hold for 40 minutes before disconnecting you and never calling back. I had friends calling the sales department and pretending to want to book a very large move in order to actually speak to someone. Roland was the man who booked me and assured me he would be my representative from beginning to end. Well guess what? After he got my deposit he disappeared. Completely useless. I’ll spare you the repeat of everything everyone else said, but after waiting 10 days for a move from California to Idaho, my things arrived with ZERO notice. Good thing I was just sitting around that day and saw the moving truck in the neighborhood. They picked my things up on a Sunday in LA and refused to accept my credit card as promised because “there is nobody to take payment on a Sunday” (what?) and pressured me into paying cash. No receipt because they “don’t have any on a Sunday” so I regretfully made the stupid decision to trust that they were honest and would let me pay the balance with credit card on delivery. Of course I had to fight and fight for that and I refused to back down until they made an “exception” and gave me my things. The men did not wear their masks on pick up or delivery which is another major issue I have  during a pandemic... oh and then many of my things were crushed, damaged or destroyed completely. Broken dishes, dented lamp, missing bolt that my mirror hangs on, stripped every single bolt in my platform bed to the point that the delivery guy was so frustrated putting it together but he somehow made it work. I’m sure my 2,000 bed frame is irreparably damaged and I’ll have to get rid of it if I ever want to move again. Who knows how he “made it work” when he put it back together. I have (had) beautiful marble top nightstands that are now cracked. They didn’t even want to put my TVs back together on delivery! I had to insist. I’m a single woman with one small bedroom. This should have been a simple move but it was a nightmare at every turn. Screw you, moving nation!< /text>

Not a bad first moving experience. The movers from Moving Nation know what they are doing and they get down to it without fuss. They don’t need anyone to supervise and if you tell them something once, they remember it. Will use Moving Nation again if I can get the same guys.<//text>

What a totally devastating experience, paid $18.000 and they stole everything that was of value and broke most of our antique furniture we will NEVER recover our losses, and to top it all I sent multiple letters return receipt to the home office and they had the nerve to sign for the letters “COVID-19 “ while they might find that clever or amusing for those of us who lost friends or family members to Covid it is totally unacceptable they should be ashamed!!</text>

<Text>We didn’t know whether we had made the right choice until we compared our experience to another family which moved into the same neighbourhood. Ours was fast, simple, no broken things and theirs was the exact opposite. The best thing is that we paid about the same. Definitely recommended!< /Text>< Name>

We made the decision to use movers instead of doing it all ourselves because we have just collected too much stuff over the years. These guys came in and made an accurate assessment of the time and cost, and then stuck to it. We are very happy with our move.</review>

If you are looking for dirt cheap labor, you’re in the wrong place. Moving Nation charges according to the quality of service they perform. If you value your possessions, trust these guys to do the job quickly and efficiently. This was my second move with Moving Nation and I will use them again.</review>

<Review>I was nervous after reading reviews. I didn’t know what to expect from a company when I moved from CA to WA. Constantine and his crew were efficient, organized, and took care in their work. I have been impressed by everyone I spoke to over the phone, from Jakob in sales to Tina in customer service. I appreciate the smooth transition that moving nation delivered.

For details: we moved a one bedroom plus music studio space. Our stuff arrived on the 3rd business day of our delivery window. We were not very accurate in our inventory list going into the move, but Constantine, the foreman was very clear on how and why the total changed. Everything was clear and well documented. I would recommend them to my closest friends and family.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The problem is that they broke a solid concrete lion I had, as well as smashed to bits my ping pong table.   I noted it all on the paperwork, filled out the additional paperwork and sent it to the claims department, and after 3 months  of waiting for a settlement, I was told that they didn't receive my paperwork and I would have to submit it all again.   Terrible customer service.   The total cost of the lion and ping pong table are only $600, but they try to make the process so difficult that the customer gives up and they don't have to pay anything.

Moving Nation almost slipped under the radar during my search for movers because they don’t advertise like crazy. Luckily, a friend suggested I check them out and the rest is history. If they keep their prices this reasonable, I will stick with them for life!< /Review>

If price is a huge factor for you, you may not like Moving Nation. If you love all the money your belongings are worth and don’t want them damaged, then Moving Nation is the ideal moving company. I am in the second group and have used them thrice already. Highly recommended.</Text>

I was forced to look for movers at the last minute because of a scheduling conflict with my new employers in South Carolina, where we were moving. It was an added and unexpected expense but considering how well and how smoothly everything turned out, I am quite glad that we chose Moving Nation. In fact, now that I have seen how much more convenient it is to have professionals handle the job, I am sorely tempted to use movers in the future. And I bet you that it will this same, very professional and reliable company once again.</Review>

<Review>Have you ever kept thinking IT HAS TO GET BETTER but it just doesn't? That is how every step with this company has felt since we committed to them. We were moving from North Carolina to Montana and Ronald reassured me that this company could do this with ease, reminding me multiple times how they were rated "3rd on consumer affairs."  Let's just say, once we paid the money, things went downhill fast. To start off, Ronald had us measure all of our belongings so he could give us an estimate. After that, we were essentially transferred to someone else within the company. A few days before pick up, Lisa from Moving Nation calls and asks us about our belongings and how they were measured. We tell her that we measured them ourselves as directed and she immediately told us that was wrong and that she would have to add money because when we measure it ourselves, it doesn't take into account "packing width" (first red flag as we did what we were told and then got told that was incorrect (even though they did not offer any other option for measuring?) and they charged us extra money). Next, we also paid for the movers to pack and unpack our house (which obviously is an extra fee). They told us that this would be a two day process. They would come the first day and pack and return the next day to load the truck. Well one day before the pack day, they called to tell us that they were actually going to do it all in one day. We have never done this before so we assumed they knew what they were doing, but did ask them to clarify that they knew they were loading our entire house. They responded that they did and that it would all be okay. HERE IS WHERE IT GETS RIDICULOUS! On packing/loading truck day.. they were scheduled to arrive from 10-1.. they arrived at 1:30 and TWO MEN get out of the truck. They come into our house and look around and start asking "what needs to go?" We reply.. "well the entire house, except a few key items." The movers look at us and say "this is a lot, we thought we were just picking up a few things, we do not have enough boxes for this." We just look at each other and say, I guess you need to go get more boxes? These guys did a GREAT job packing up our house. However, it started getting later and later and we asked if this was typical. One mover said, yeah we were at an apartment until 5am the other night so hopefully it won't go that late. Well close, they finished at 4:30 AM!  We were obviously exhausted at this point (as were the movers) so when they told us the paperwork they received from Moving Nation was completely blank, we were not surprised. I guess at this point they called someone to get some details about our move and then realized they packed more cubic feet than we paid for so charged us an additional 900 and something dollars more. After this, we started calling every day to get some answers and to find out if our stuff was going to be delivered on the day expected. No one would answer the phone. No one would call us back. We finally got a hold of someone one day before our expected delivery date, only to find out that our truck was in California and had to go all the way back to Baltimore before picking up our stuff and heading to Montana! They could not give us a new expected delivery date and told us it was a difficult route to Montana and we should understand that?? Well, here we are 20 days after our desired delivery day and our stuff arrived. They didn't even call us this morning to say they were almost here. THIS WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! IT IS A FRAUD AND THE BIGGEST HASSLE!!!<//Review><time>1598390372518</time><userid>105069999222105223211<//userid><response>None<//response>< user_name>

For those who are lucky enough to be able to consider quality over just cost, you cannot go wrong with this company. I used to go for the cheapest option before but a couple of terrible experiences later, I have definitely become a stickler for quality when it comes to entrusting all the contents of my house to strangers. This is the second time I have used them and can assure you that their performance is consistently strong. It may seem like you are getting a massively better deal with other movers but donít say I didn’t warn you.<//Text>

I am so surprised that I have actually been given the chance to write a positive review of a moving company that I have used. My previous experiences have been really upsetting and if I was younger and could move myself, I would have never considered paid movers considering how they always took advantage of me. But Moving Nation is different in how they operate. Here, you have a company with ethics that won’t scam people who are paying them for a service. In fact, they go beyond the basics and excel right across the board. 5 stars.<//review>

<Review>•	I hired Moving Nation for an out of state home move on 8/26/20. Before signing any contract with Moving Nation, I stressed the fact that I needed my furniture ASAP, so storage of my property was out of the question as far as I was concerned. The sales representative, (Ronald K) assured me that this would not happen with my move. He stated that storage of property was a service the company offered upon request by the customer. Storage options were for customers who needed extra time before they could except their delivery. I told Ronald that we were moving from Oregon to Missouri so I expected that my furniture would arrive between 5 to 6 days tops. He agreed and assured me that the driver would be in constant contact with me throughout the move. The driver would give me daily updates as to where they were and the ETA for delivery as they got closer to my home. Ronald's promise of a smooth move that was filled with on the spot daily communication from driver to me sounded great and looked great on paper to. This all fell apart quickly when moving day arrived. On 8/26 we received a call from costumer service, "Tina" stating the drivers would be at our home between 10 am and 1 pm. Long story short, Tina changed the arrival time several times throughout the day. Right up until the time their office closed at which point their phone just rang and rang. Around 8:30 that night two unexperienced (movers?), show up in a small box truck and struggled to load my furniture until 1 am at which point the decided to leave without letting us know where they were going or when they would return. They finished on 8/27/20. After the truck was loaded, they unloaded everything into a nearby storage unit and I haven't seen my property since. As of 9/14/20 and countless attempts to contact Moving Nation only to be stone walled, we remain without furniture and information as to where or when to expect it. At one point I was able to speak with someone at moving nation in the costumer service department. She told me that my property was not scheduled for delivery anytime soon because I still owed them money. She went on to say that she couldn't say anymore about this matter until I paid $3662. She stated that this was the portion of the bill the driver should have collected upon pick up but did not. I explained that I offered this payment to one of the two men sent by Moving Nation on 8/26 after showing up at my home at mid-night and the man refused to except the money. She continued to repeat that I needed to pay the money now. Feeling pressured I made the requested payment of $3662. First, I alerted my bank to keep track of the payment because I felt this company wasn’t legitimate. After making the payment I called Moving Nation's costumer service department letting them know the payment was complete and I wanted the information Tina had promised. Tina refused to give me any more information as to the location of my property nor a date when to expect delivery. She then stated that another payment of $3662 would be required upon delivery and she didn’t have an ETA of such delivery. As well, she couldn’t guarantee that they were keeping my property safe. I feel that I was forced to pay an additional payment on top of the $1288 I paid as the first installment before the move. I have met all of Moving Nations demands and got nothing in return. Moving Nation has increased the cost of my move that started out as $5994.99 and growing to $8,987. Moving Nation allowed me to believe that the movers were in route with my furniture but after 3 days pass without hearing anything from the drivers I start calling Tina to find out what was going on. Several unanswered call later I reach Tina. She informs me that my furniture wasn’t on its way and it had been placed in a storage unit somewhere. She refused to divulge the location of the storage unit that still holds my property as of 9/17/20. I am still asking them ,Where is my property and at what point will it be delivered? Their 17-business day BS is up!< /Review>< pictures>

Very disappointed with my service. I had a great experience with my sales representative he was very friendly and helpful. But after that it all went downhill.. when the movers arrived the 2nd day of my day move they started complaining just about everything. When my husband and I moved everything right up to the driveway. We had less things than were listed in the contract. Yet the movers would say this is not there this is not there. Then they shrink wrapped the fridge and stove and at the end gave us a bill for $160. If I had know they where going to charge that much from the begging I would have done it my self.. we taped down the plastic bins and wrapped up the TVs with our own moving blankets that they had stated where going to be provided for the move but we just wanted to make everything easier. After that they charged us around $600 more because we went over cubic ft. I asked how is that possible if we are taking way less then the contact stated. The bigger items like the sofas and island table was staying and yet we are over. The mover said hopefully is less when it’s moved to the semi since they will arrange it. Well I got over it and said oh well we just want the move to get on so we did it. Now it’s July 15 and our move was on June 18 and we still don’t have our things. So, about 2 weeks ago I called to follow up since we had not heard back. When I. Called they put me on hold since they couldn’t find an update on my things.. when I first spoke to sells representative he stated that it would be 5-14 business days but that it usually doesn’t take that long but it’s just policy to say that long.. so I’m like okay. I was hoping that it would get here with in a week and 3 weeks later I still find out my things are in California. I have been trying to get a manager to speak to me and yet can since customer care can handle it. I have been trying to contain myself but this is by far the worst customer service I have received and this service is not cheap.. truly disappointed and would recommend my friends or family.<//Text>

I wouldn’t have my worst enemy uses people.  And then they charged me for a full truck and a fourth of it was all there crap. NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT</Review>< Pictures>

Very fast workers, something that I never thought I would ever say about a moving companyís employees. They manage to handle items of all sizes between the 2 of them and still pull it off without any damage. Amazing!

Based on our experience using Moving Nation this time, no doubt we will hire them again if we ever need to move again. A lot of it comes down to the care they take but is also partly because they stick to what they say in terms of both price and time.< /text>

<Review>This is not a legitimate company. They have lost, damaged and torn through our belongings, sent us furniture that does not belong to us, absconded with items we own, will not return phone calls, gave an incorrect estimate for move then charged us $1400 extra for overages. Stay away. They have different addresses under LLC’s so very difficult to hold them responsible. I could go on and on. This move on November 2 2020.

<Review>This is a positive review for Moving Nation that was nearly an angry rant because of a misunderstanding. After I complained, they promptly reached out to us and resolved the issue to our satisfaction. The speed and manner in which they navigated this prickly issue is a testament to their great customer service skills as well as their commitment to getting the job done right. Other than that, their prices are reasonable and they offer good discounts if you need limited space. The movers display enthusiasm and are always open to suggestions. Good company.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>ZERO STARS!!  This company is a huge FRAUD.  I was given a price based on a walk through I did with the sales rep over the phone.  I literally walked room by room explaining all of the stuff I had.  All the "little things" such as pots & pans, kids toys, books, clothes, etc...he stated "don't worry about all that stuff, I will include a certain amount of boxes at the end, that will cover the packaging of all those items.  Boy was he ever wrong!  Upon pick up, we had already gotten rid of a lot of items meaning everything we discussed to be moved, had been reduced but the price had more than DOUBLED.  That's not an exaggeration, more than doubled.

These people are crooks!!!  How can you be so far off on your estimate.  And they pretty much hold you hostage because they know you've already made all the arrangements needed to have your stuff shipped so you pretty much have to pay and then try to deal with it on the back end.

That leads me to the customer service of this company or lack there of.  If you're lucky enough to get someone on the line, your only met with rudeness, hostility, and no care whatsoever about anything you have concerns with.  I believe Tina is the name of the person who normally answers but most of the time, you are asked to leave a message and they will "call you back" which I have yet to receive a call from them after leaving four messages!  Nadene is the other "manager" who is supposed to solve all your billing issues...I have yet to be able to speak to her but I see other reviews stating that she is horrible just like the first lady you are forced to deal with.

SAVE YOUR MONEY & HEARTACHE....use a different company, you will regret this one.  Over three weeks now since my property was picked up and I still do not have it.  These people are crooks and from the looks of it, I'm sure my items will be delivered damaged.  I can't say it enough, CROOKS, without a care in the world about you, your property or the problems they cause you.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<review>My relocation from Portland, OR to Orlando, FL could not have gone better! Moving Nation were on time for the loading and delivered everything ahead of schedule because I asked them to try and hurry things up. Their speed aside, they also do a good job of securing your things so that there is minimal vibration or chance of damage during transit. It is these small touches that tell you that these people are in it not just for the money but to do a good job. I will most certainly hire them again if I am moving in the future.< /review><user_name>Ryan Bennett<//user_name><rating>5< /rating><gmap_id>0x809adbf88b9425f3:0x7c86151f0da49036</gmap_id>< date>

<Review>I would give this company a negative 0 review. In my move from California to Arizona  in October they lost several brand new furniture pieces and a few boxes with personal items, jewelry included.. furniture arrived in  16 days  when sales told me 3-6 days. I was referred to an insurance claim company for my losses that basically covered nothing. Don’t use!!< /Review>< Pics>

After trying to save money but getting ripped off by rogue movers the last time round, I opted for the full service professionals at Moving Nation this time. Sure, they are more expensive but it isnít some sort of a scam the additional cost goes into training their staff not just in moving essentials but also in teaching them customer service. No rude, disinterested personnel here, just a great bunch of people working together to make your move fast, simple and painless.< /Review>

This is the biggest scam out there.  They quoted me $5100 and then showed up the day of the move, refusing to put masks on and packed a box marker wardrobe with anything that was within their reach and then said if you want us to finish it will be over $18,000.  RUN FOR THE HILLS AND STAY AWAY FROM THESE LOWLIFES!!!!</text>

<Time>1607624999608</Time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Steer clear! They held my stuff hostage, broke things, and charged me 40% more to get my stuff!

I initially spoke to a Moving Specialist and we FaceTimed so he could lock in the inventory and provide a quote. The bid was competitive, but that's where things started going sideways.

The next day someone from the QA team called to verify the quote and noticed that he had "done a few things wrong." He intentionally mis-quoted items despite seeing them over FaceTime. He flagged the Peloton as a personal bike, desk as a side table, BBQ as a personal grill, 55" TV as a computer screen, and others... It resulted in an immediate 15% increase in price. The QA team said they would provide feedback to his manager, but they could not adjust the price as it was a "factual" quote based on their revised assessment.

After I paid them again I never heard from them. Despite repeated calls to check on my moving date, movers showed with an hour notice the day before I was scheduled. After dealing with that nightmare and getting everything loaded on the truck they announced another error and they said the total inventory was off and it was going to be an additional 40% cost.

Long story short, the cost of my move nearly doubled, my stuff was delivered a week late, and they broke a ton of items. Oh and they lost 20% of my boxes which are still to be found.

Moving Nation is a broker. Go hire a moving company directly. Read all of these horrible reviews. I thought my situation would be different, but was I ever wrong. These people are a scam.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I was missing a lot of stuff boxes never got to me they didn’t really explain that we were to make a not of every box. They broke my Dyson vacuum an expensive tool box lamps. And to top it off our stuff didn’t get to us for 14 days after the date we needed it. Boxes were crushed my dryer door was cracked and that happened before they even got it on the truck they tried to tell me it was already broke no it wasn’t but good try. So beware we never got anything from the missing stuff or from the fact that it didn’t arrive on time.<//Text>< pictures>

Why did I never find Moving Nation before this move??? I have wasted literally thousands and thousands of dollars over the years on incompetent, inconsiderate and dishonest people masquerading as movers. The quality of the move, the attitude of the movers and the entire experience was well worth the price.< /review>

<review>My wife and I purchased a home in Marietta Georgia on September 2, 2020. Upon the purchase we started to research long distance moving companies. Having interviewed five companies we narrowed it down to two eventually going with Moving Nation. Having had a very good experience with their representative Eric Meyer the price of $10443.27 was agreed upon and the contract signed. The pick up date was to be October 1, 2020. Once the contract was signed and the down payment of $2341.00 was paid we were passed onto Lisa for finalizing everything. She as Eric and Jimmy another sales rep seemed very pleasant.

Well moving day came and the two trucks with four men showed up being very courteous and professional. We had packed most of our belongings ourselves, leaving the big items. I watch over them very closely and they were being very careful packing everything properly as we had gone through this a year and a half ago because of the Woosley fire. All seemed to be going smoothly.

Then at around 4pm things seemed to come to a halt. All the big pieces which had been packed and ready to be put on the truck were standing in the house as the head man made phone calls. Well low and behold he came to us and said that unless we paid them another $5242.00 they were finished loading the trucks. But you have eighty percent of our furnishings on your truck. We have been told by our supervisor we are done unless you pay. I asked to speak with the supervisor only to be told I wasn't allowed to. So we called Eric and Lisa only to be transfered to an answering machine. At this time what do you do, we paid, they finished and left with our gear having been told by Eric and Jimmy that on October 2, 2020 our furnishings will be transferred onto a bigger truck and leave for Georgia ariving 7 to 10 days later.
As Monday October 12th approached I called to get an update as to when we were to recieve our belongings only to find out that everything was in storage in Sacramento. Are you kidding me pick the gear up in Malibu and drive it to Sacramento to transfer to another truck, not very efficent. We have actually been told our belonging have been loaded on three different occasions only to find out it wasn't true. First time Nadine said it will load on Thursday October 15th and leave on  Friday October 16. Didn't happen we have now been passed onto Tina who twice has said we will load this weekend and travel out begining of week. Everytime I call for update it gets pushed for another week or two.
November 11, 2020 sitting in an empty house in Georgia with two chairs a blow up bed, dog, and cat. Furshings still in sacramento with no firm date as to when we will if ever see our lovely belongings. The stress that has been perpetrated upon my wife and I is palpable.

Would anyone be interested in putting together a class action law suite?

We finally mailed in our list of damaged and lost items to the home office. Sent signed registered receipt to be returned thus so we would know it was received. Came back signed covid 19. Spoke with Tina about this she did confirm that it was in there mail box and said the post man signed it that way.  YET ANOTHER LIE!!!!

This is the moving company nightmares are made of. The sales department told us everything they knew we wanted to hear and did the exact opposite. We had our first quote done by phone. I walked room by room measuring and describing every item and box count. The first quote was given and deposit made. No turning back. We received a call from a customer service rep and I use that term only because I’m being nice. We went back through the items over the phone and I was told it would be $1900 dollars more than the original quote. She made it clear that the sales people sometimes don’t do the best job estimating. Really??!! I was also told I would lose my deposit at this point if I backed out. I called customer service daily because they could never give me a definitive date for pick up. Finally, the night before we received a call that they would be there the next day. Saturday October 3rd. Now if you have read any of the other reviews you know what happens from here. They brought a small box truck and after loading it half full told us the price had to be adjusted. Of course it did. So from the initial quote we are now $5000 higher. So off goes all our worldly belongings to get this, a storage facility. Our items were supposed to be in Mississippi by Friday the 9th. We received most of our items yesterday the first of November. Antiques have been damaged, tv stand disappeared, all the legs for my sofa are gone. The legs to my antique desk are missing. Two legs broken off of another sofa and various large items missing. A large fountain, now how on earth they misplaced that is anybody’s guess. An antique love seat, a very expensive Basset recliner, a wing chair, a chaise lounge and our bbq grill. Not only have they lied about everything from when we would receive our items, the cost of the move and even when the movers left California but now we are being told they will let us know if they find our missing furniture. REALLY??!!!<//Text>

We did not originally intend to hire Moving Nation but a company with a similar name. Funnily enough, these things often work out for the best - we have discovered an awesome, reliable moving company that is quick but thorough. Definite recommend and we will use again ourselves.</review>

Absolutely unacceptable- 2 hours late AND doubled my quote. NO- don’t use, highly unethical.  Jakob Messer was misleading, and would do anything for me to sign a docusign that most people would not understand- it’s why you hire a mover! He picked apart every other quote and made me feel that  I was In safe hands- DONT SIGN!!!!   UNETHICAL!!!< /Text>

Moving Nation is the gold standard of professional movers. I can say this after having worked in a moving company myself before and then having used a number of other companies to move in the past few years. First of all, they are punctual. The truck arrived at the time they said and completed the move within their allotted time. Secondly, they stick to their estimates. The total we paid was close to the figure we were quoted. Lastly, their customer service is excellent. All questions are answered promptly and clearly< /Review>

<Text>This was a refreshing change from the usual drama I have become used to when using moving companies. Finally, here are people who respect your time and the fact that moving is a really complicated and difficult time for the people who are moving. I had to move all the contents of a 3-bedroom home and that is a heck of a distance and a heck of a lot of things. Moving Nation just did everything right from start to finish and I am very happy with the way the move turned out.< /Text>< Pictures>

Long before I could afford to use movers, I had heard a lot of good things about Moving Nation in and around my neighborhood. Now that I had to move after all these years, they were the first company that came to mind. My first experience hiring them really confirms all the positive things I had heard second-hand before. The entire team is courteous, from the managers to the helpline operators and the movers. My experience has been just as good as I had been led to believe before I used them so I am very happy with that.< /Text>

If you decide not to read any further, just takeaway this: Do NOT use this company. After Roland, the sales rep, made the sale-he went dark. I asked for a PDF copy of the contract I signed and for help with updates and he just ignored me. Here are the main cautions from using them:

-You have to sign more ppw when the movers come, not a big deal but the fine print states that they have 30 business days to deliver your things. My things were picked up August 27th, the first available delivery I gave was Sept 3, and my things arrived on October 1. I moved from CA to CO where they estimate it will take 7-10 business days.

My things were 'loaded' on the sept 14th and supposed to leave on the 18th, no one called that day or the days prior. On the 18th I called to confirm it left but there was a 'mechanical issue' and it didnt . On Monday the 21st, it was leaving and 'should arrive by the weekend'. Thursday, the 24th it was in Colorado and supposed to deliver that weekend. No one called. Monday, the 28th, I called dispatch wondering why the driver never called and was told there was a 'delay'. she didnt know why, when it would be here or if it was even in route.

-The first available delivery date you put down is the earliest they would delivery-not when they will be there and the clock starts from THAT date.

-Scratched my front door when moving out, my desk arrived broken when delivering and they asked me if i packed it that way

-Most boxes look very disheveled

-If you are moving to a big city, DO NOT USE they will come with a 53' trailer could ultimately charge you extra if they can't get access and have to load your things on a smaller van

-For loading their truck was 72ft from my front door, they tried charging me $75 for long carry (when the first 75ft is supposed to be free, but the kicker is they tried charging me $75x3). Not sure why the charge it anyways when they carried things down the stairs-loaded it on a dolly and then put it on a liftgate to load into the truck

-once your things are picked up, the dispatch office won't have much information. I always spoke with Tina who seemingly gets no information to pass along to anyone and you're left wondering when it will arrive, putting your life on hold.

-they give no proactive communication and say they will call u back and never do.

-delivery men did not wear a MASK

-Nadine, the customer service person, I'm almost convinced she doesn't exist-asked to speak with her twice and they won't transfer you, it's always 'we'll ask her to call you back"</text>

Under no circumstances should you use this company. Joe Campbell  will quote you at less than half of what the end cost will be. They will tell you it will be 17 days at the very longest but it never takes that long. Now they are saying it is 17 business days from the time we moved in not from when they took our stuff. It has been a month without my stuff. I have 4 children under the age of 5. We are stuck at home because of the corona crisis with literally nothing. Nadine is their customer service, she will allow you to talk to nobody else and only answers your call once a week and will never call you back. She told me she would have someone call me back. I asked her if that was truth and she responded "you can go ahead and interpret that however you want". I have no idea what to do. I still don't have my stuff and there are so many things I need for my family. Medicine, toilet paper, documents. Please please don't hire this company to move your life.<//text>

For my past two moves, I had considered Moving Nation but decided on other companies because they were slightly cheaper. However, those 2 moves turned out to be bad experiences and this one turned out perfect, proving ‘pay peanuts, get monkeys’. These guys are professionals and worth the cost.<//Review>

This review is our way of expressing our gratitude to the Moving Nation team, from the phone operators to the office managers and definitely to the hardworking movers who did all the hard work. We are elated that you managed to sort everything out as smoothly as you did considering moving a 4-bedroom house is no mean feat. Moving ain’t ever easy but you guys made the process a lot more bearable than we could have anticipated. We are very thankful for your help and wish you a great, blessed life ahead. Take care!</text>

I worked for a rival company some years ago before starting my own business in a different field. My bosses used to regard Moving Nation as their strongest competition… which is why I chose them when I wanted to move myself. Competition, be very, very scared. They are good.</text>

We were given a hard working crew of movers that knew what they were doing and needed minimal supervision to complete the entire task. I think the final price came to about the same as we were charged for moving into the place about 3 years ago so that’s a pretty good deal considering how everything’s gotten more expensive since. I was also very happy to see that the pair of movers were regular guys who we could talk to rather than people with scowls who just give one word answers. A much better moving experience than I anticipated.</text>

This was the absolute worst moving company we've ever dealt with. The truck took a month to get to its final destination when we had an agreement for delivery within 10 days. When we called for updates, we had a 10% chance of reaching anyone in the customer service, delivery/pickup or accounting departments. We left several messages for weeks and never got a call back. We also had an agreement to pay the last two payments by credit card, then they reneged on the agreement and forced us to get cash or a money order for the final payment. The driver also showed up three hours earlier than the originally scheduled arrival time and didn't speak english. He tried to charge us $150 per hour for waiting, which was their fault due to the last minute change in payment arrangements. Their customer service agents are extremely rude and I heard them cussing at the top of their lungs in the background on at least one occasion. Avoid this company at all costs!< /Text>

They were superb when selling me the moving package to move from TX to SD. The crew that picked up our furniture (Mike) was excellent!  However, upon the guaranteed 17 business day for delivery of our furniture, they were nowheryto be seen.  We called several times to get updates (even before the 17 days) & Tina just kept telling us she was "trying" to get update. Made many calls for a supervisor/manager.  Guess they don't have those. They're real good at putting you on hold & transferring you to Neverland.  Nadene yelled at me & laughed at me & was useless.  Tina doesn't know anything.  The Map Moving & Storage contractor that's supposed to deliver our furniture said it would be August 30.  Over a month from our pick up date of July 26!  And they don't have managers either. No one will give us an answer.  It's like they have stolen our furniture!  So much for trusting Consumer Affairs! (They were 3rd on list of the best)!!! We are contacting attorney</review>

<UserId.>117790738054766776095<//UserId.><Review>Buyer Be Aware before signing anything with this company.   I signed up with this company in March prior to COVID - 19 for a move in June.  I also put up a deposit, which I have since learned is something you should never do with a moving company.  I called the first of June to confirm moving dates/times, etc. and was told that a quality assurance person would notify me 7 days prior to my move date with a specific date and time and I would sign new paperwork.  This is something that is not stated in their paperwork.     A week prior to my move I still hadn't heard from them, so cancelled my contract and requested a return of my deposit.  After several emails, they have declined to refund my deposit since they require a 7 business day notice from the first scheduled pick up date, which I had not been provided.  I don't believe that they have any intentions of refunding any earnest money under any circumstances and I also don't think they would have shown up to pack and move my stuff.</Review><Rating>1</Rating><username>Melinda Northrup< /username></record>

<Review>Move on....do NOT move with these guys.   They quoted us aggressively and to be certain we were on the same page they had a specialist named Lisa to go over Cubic feet, etc.   Even after raising our quote they  could not honor it.   they showed up a day late...then increased the move cost by 75% subjecting the squeeze of finding another mover before our closing date.     We had to call police to get them to leave because they starting to unwrap items.   Stressful!!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

If someone tells you all moving companies are the same, i.e. bad, they probably haven’t used these guys before. We used them out of necessity because of a tight schedule but it has completely changed our perception of what the industry is like. Good experience and I would definitely recommend.</Review>

<Review>**I have an update on my move and it is not good at all. We have now been waiting for our furniture for get this..... 8 weeks now! I have filed a complaint with the BBB and they still have done nothing. They told me they had 17 business days to get our furniture to us and that was from the day of pick up. That day came and went and then they said 17 business days from the day of delivery date. That day has come and gone and still no answer from salesman Eric Meyer or customer service. Then I got a guy on the phone just a few mintues ago and he told me that is whAT HAPPENS, YOU WIN SOME YOU LOSE SOME!! Can you believe that Now we are going to have to go to arbitration, RUN FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!

Be very careful with this company!! They arrived 2 hours late and took 9 hours to move a 1 bedroom apartment and they said "they get paid by the hour". Then they tried 3 times to up charge me for services that were included in my contract for 450.00. Then they cubic quote was off by 300 cubic feet which almost doubled the price and we didnt have that much extra. They also havent returned my phone calls after 4 attempts and my sales person Eric Meyer will not return emails or calls either to help us.
To make things worse the movers didn't speak english and communicating was very difficult and made the situations even more tense.< /Review>< pictures>

The Worst People Customer service ever, I signed a contract with them On March 29th spoke to Mike Burrs and he was so nice but once I decided to cancel they became the most the enemy they were rude over the phone, I asked for a manager and I was told it was non of my business, Customer service lady Lisa was hostile also...All I want is my deposit back because they lied about there service That Mike person needs to get an award on the best Suave liar ever. so people don't get fooled on those 5 star reviews I'm sure they are doing their own reviews.< /text>

What a great group of people work at this company! I have only good things to say about the movers and also the booking personnel I spoke with a few ties to organize the move. It’s great when everything works as you have been promised and their team is excellent!<//text>

This is one of probably just a handful of moving companies that I would trust to handle all my belongings and then to deliver them all in one piece and on time. They haven’t let me down once in the 6-7 times I have used them. Spectacular as always.<//text>

Nice, polite and hardworking movers who know what to do and get right to doing it. The office staff is also very nice and willing to spend time explaining their costs and procedures to curious clients (Like me). You probably guessed it: I highly recommend Moving Nation< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Love this company a bit more every time I use them. In fact, I had hired them for both my 4-bedroom home and my office this time since they did an excellent job the last time when I was moving houses. Moving Nation is just as professional whatever the job may be – they know how to handle everything from coffee tables to copy machines! The best thing is that if you are out of your depth with the packing etc., they will jump in and make sure all your things are protected and secured properly before loading them.</review>< Pictures>

I contacted this company about moving. I chose a different company but they have continued to harass me for two months. I keep telling them I've already moved yet I continue to receive multiple phone calls, texts and emails every week. I tried to "unsubscribe" but it didn't work. It said my email which listed someone else's email, was already unsubscribed. I tried to fill out a form and it was prefilled with someone else s
Information. I also received group emails where I could see other people's email addresses. No privacy on info AT ALL.  Do NOT contact them!!<//Review>

<review>Moving Nation was recommended to me by a friend who has a realty business and deals with dozens of moving companies for his clients. Needless to say, his recommendation was spot on. No drama and delays like I have heard other people experience. Easy to recommend to any prospective mover.< /review>< name>

< Review>
DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!  They will give you a low estimate while telling you that they overestimate so that there will be no additional charges at delivery.  They talk a great game about their service- there are none.  They call before the move after the time in which you can cancel and then up the cost.  They do not contact you at all about when they are coming- in fact communication is nil and they never return calls.  If you do manage to get an answer- you get Lisa who is arrogant and condescending with no customer service skills.  When they show up- suddenly the cost doubles due to more cubic feet.  They also don’t tell you that they take your stuff to their warehouse and load it into a storage unit.  Why not load truck and drive it to me then?  The inventory papers were unreadable and driver couldn’t give me a receipt for my paper but promised to email to me right away.  Still waiting.....Then the waiting game begins.... they don’t contact you- you have to make repeated calls but dispatcher can’t give you an answer.  Then finally they tell you that truck is loaded and delivery will be the next day or day after.  They do not show up of course.  They tell me they just finished a job a few hours north but for some reason can’t get therefor another 8 hrs.  Truth is that my stuff was sitting somewhere an hour south of me- probably in another storage unit.  The driver was a contract driver who was very nice but unaware of what Type of items I had which tells me he did not oversee packing of truck.  He arrived in an enterprise rental truck and someone following him that they had called that day to help- also very nice but had never done moving before.  My boxes and totes arrived torn and smashed. Things that had been packed in boxes prior were carried in individually.  Who knows what is sitting on storage area floor that never made it.  Dish and glass boxes were upside down as were most boxes marked fragile.  I would not give them any stars if I was able.  Believe that any positive reviews are probably friends and family as there are a lot of other people who suffered the same nightmare experience that I did. As an addendum- after unpacking my belongings- we discovered that so much weight had been piled our recliner that the springs and metal pieces holding seat had snapped and we had to throw it out as well as a lot of dented and broken items.  Never found my silverware and some dishes.  All of my wood furniture pieces were scratched and wood finish worn away despite being covered!!!</Review>

My grandma had a contract saying her stuff would be delivered on a certain date. The date comes and now the company is saying they can’t deliver until month later and that it is going to cost thousands more. The trucking company delivering the product is hired through Moving Nation and they seem to be extorting customers.< /review>

Highly recommended moving company, whether you are moving around the corner or across the country. We have used them a number of times and they have always managed to perform ahead of our expectations. Would not even consider any other movers even if they were cheaper.< /text>

< review>
The only time I switched movers in the past few years and chose a company other than Moving Nation, it was a complete disaster that actually ended up in court. When I think back, it was because I wanted to save a few dollars on moving and decided to put my trust in a bunch of thieves who had a flashy website and a team of professional liars manning their phones. Moving Nation may be a bit more expensive than the bargain basement movers but they are worth their price.</review>

Many movers don’t have a good reputation but Moving Nation is completely different. They excel in an industry that is filled with dishonesty and half-truths, as I have discovered the hard way twice in the past. So glad for this refreshingly different and pleasant experience.<//Review>

I never like letting someone else do work I can do, but I figured to make my wife happy I would give it a shot. Let me start by saying my wife never compliments a company unless they go above and beyond. I can say I was not 100% sure I made the right decision, but in the end I came out looking like the hero to my wife. The crew was amazing and the folks in the office answered any call to help me with an issue on move day. They spoke to the movers and all was resolved. Thanks for making my wife happy and my life easy.<//Review>

This is the worst moving company, do not use them. It has been a nightmare since the start. We were charged for extra cubic feet upon pick up, we paid extra for guaranteed delivery but our items still arrived a week later. The driver showed up late on a Sunday evening by himself with no crew to move and my husband had to help him. We have 2 suitcases and over 30 boxes missing. Our stuff was repacked and thrown into larger boxes, as a result we have uncovered a lot of broken items. Customer service is awful and unresponsive. Do NOT use this company.</Text>

<review>I 100% agree with kay lamendolas review below. I am 1/2 way through a move. They have increased my price over 40%. My list was correct. They under quoted the cubic footage and my 7200 quote is now 11400. Contacting them has been very tuff. They cannot tell me when truck will arrive. They also cannot tell me why the cost is so much more. They said my furniture was oversized. It is standard furniture. Complete joke.The paperwork they finally sent through is not readable. Lisa is not a nice person to deal with. I will update my review if i ever get my stuff and they make things right. So far the service has been horrible. I do not recommend to anybody.</review><rate>1<//rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x809adbf88b9425f3:0x7c86151f0da49036<//gmap_id>< user_id>

"GROW UP  you put your information online NOT US!!  If you don't like calls then DON'T put your info online!! #FACTS :)"

Stay Away - the 5 star reviews are fake. Drunk men hired off of Craigslist were used. The driver stayed in his AC controlled cab while I ended up unloading half the truck.

They quote low and invoice high. I brought this up sent emails, called and no one will get back to me. I feel like I’ve been robbed. Absolutely stunned by how bad the experience was.</review>

<Review>This company extorted us and attempted larceny. They took 6 weeks to deliver my goods after they loaded them. They were a month late in delivering my goods. The US DOT and the Texas DMV sent officials to seize my goods and deliver them back to me. Government officials called my situation a “hostage of goods”. Do not do business with this company.< /Review>< date>

Unprofessional Moving Company
I used Moving Nation for a cross country move as I was sold a move by Joe Campbell. My move was difficult in that the house at origin was three stories. I explained all of the nuances to Joe in detail as everything seemed to be properly explained, cost determined, dates determined (1 day of packing and one day of loading for a 4 bedroom place).

However, after I submitted my deposit, everything changed.
I found out that none of the details had been passed to the operations personnel. Instead of the two day move, the movers showed up at 1:30 on the second day having already worked a move that morning.

I was told by the foreman that "where were we supposed to find a crew to conduct a two day packing job in mid-summer."

I was also told that that some of the movers, "had apparently either embellished their experience levels as they were pressed to find personnel to work the move"

One mover actually slammed an article of mine down on my hardwood floor because he was reprimanded by his supervisor for improperly moving the article, in which he damaged it by breaking the side tray from improperly carrying it.

I was taken aback, as this was supposed to be a professional moving company, as it was their responsibility to find adequate trained personnel for a move.

In addition to being  unprofessional, inexperienced, breaking items and damaging my house in the process., the packing was woefully subpar. The the boxes were not properly labeled, they did not even have the room of origin labeled on them, as I was told that this was company policy.

I have never had rooms of origin not written on the boxes (i.e. Master bedroom, guest room etc.)

The move foreman was inexperienced and failed to properly monitor the process. The movers were also unsafe as several items were improperly moved almost resulting in injuries to the movers due to their lack of experience.

At destination, several items were broken due to their rushed packing job. I would also like to mention that there were lose items due to the rushed job, as several items were missed, and had to be either packed last minute or stashed in boxes with items from other parts of the house.

For these reasons, i must give them 1 star and recommend not using this company.</review>

This company is unethical. Buyer BEWARE. We ended up paying $3000 more than our original estimate. They refused to deliver to our new home citing they could not get an 18  wheeler on our street when 18 wheelers travel our road regularly and then charged us an additional $1400 to instead rent a Uhaul and transfer all of our stuff and then bring it to our house and then unload it ALL for a second time. Once it did arrive the movers were unprofessional and they broke several pieces of furniture.The customer service is horrific. They will not return your calls. This was the nightmare moving company everyone fears.<//review>

<user>117397609656297373554<//user><Name>jessica “Jett” Ison<//Name><Review>Moving nation is not true to their word. I was promised all sorts of all star service for my move and things seemed ok until moving day. I packed my own belongings and so the responsibility of the movers was just to load what I had packed and wrap and load furniture. To begin with, I was given an arrival window for the movers from 11-2 pm on July 8th with a call an hour before the movers were on the way. At 1 pm I had received no calls or notifications as to when the movers would arrive so I called customer service. They placed me on hold and then told me the movers would be calling me shortly. I did receive a call a few minutes later stating that the movers would be there around 6 pm because they were coming to Virginia from Maryland! We were planning to be driving from Newport News VA to our new home in Las Vegas by that time, unfortunately we did not get on the road until 1030 pm due to this company's poor planning and delivery of services. I was also promised to have my belongings within 17 business days from July 10th, our first available delivery date. It is now August 2nd (the last day of promised delivery window) and after numerous calls over the last 3 weeks to customer service I have been told the same thing for every call: my belongings were still in scheduling status, meaning all of my property is still sitting in a warehouse in Virginia. There was no reason given as to why it took so long and nobody from customer service can give me any other information from dispatch department. At this point I have been told that there is a $30 reimbursement for each day they are past the delivery window (I'm sure this means each business days, which does not include weekends, so in reality I have been waiting in an empty house for a total of 23 days for my belongings to arrive with no end in sight). I was hesitant to hire a moving company at all due to all the horrendous reviews for every company I researched plus my previous experience with another terrible company, but I had to. Moving nation had the least amount of complaints and plenty of stellar reviews so I opted to go with them. I have no faith that this company will hold up their end of the bargain and due to all the fine print written into their contracts I am at their mercy. If my belongings arrive unharmed and without anything missing AND I get the reimbursement promised to me I may reconsider my rating but as of now this company is worth ZERO stars.< /Review><gmap_id>0x809adbf88b9425f3:0x7c86151f0da49036</gmap_id><rating>1</rating>< time>

Worse people. I had a rate for $2100 and next time they called me, i gave them the list of inventory, they gave me a rate for 2600 and i put $947 deposit. Then they came for pickup, they said $3200. I said ok thats enough and canceled my service. Now they refuse to give me my deposit back..
worse people unless you are willing to get robbed.

Staff is very friendly! The hygienist was very gentle and thorough. The best part is how they explain everything they are doing. The dentist has it set up so you can see your x-rays from the  chair and explains in detail. The recommendations all were reasonable. The only thing I didn’t like was how their workspaces opened up to the whole office, didn’t feel private.  I can definitely live with that.< /Text>

This was my first visit, and I was switching from another dentist, so as always there is concern about going to a new doctor, but the staff at Laguna Springs Dental quickly put all those concerns to rest. They were all extremely friendly and truly concerned about my comfort at all steps of the process. The facilities are very modern with modern equipment and procedures. I feel like I will be coming back for many years to come.

Update: I have in fact been back many times and even recommended the rest of my family to come to Laguna Springs Dental. They continue to impress, make me feel like a valued customer, and genuinely care about my health. They are definitely the best dentists in Elk Grove.<//review>

Dr. Mustafa himself sets high standards of dental health care and delivers the best patient results. I recommend Laguna Springs Dental.< /Text>

I love Laguna Springs Dental! Everybody is very professional and accommodating and the office looks like it came straight out of a magazine.  They communicate about appointments very well and remember who I am as soon as I walk in. Glazel my dental hygienist is always extremely pleasant and caters to my sensitive teeth. I especially love that they have a topical solution that numbs my mouth so the cleaning is comfortable. I can't see myself or my husband ever going somewhere else.</Text>

I've been going to this dentist for a very short time but I feel relaxed and welcome there. The staff is very professional and the dental assistant who worked on me was such a sweetheart and gentle too. I went in for a root canal but turned out the dentist was able to avoid a root canal and save me some money. The whole place is very clean and has a spa feel to it. Its easy to find and the wait times are minimal. I like to show up a little early to make sure I can get any paperwork I need finished before my appointment time and they always get me back in the chair by my appointment time. Everyone is very kind, the massage chair was nice, and the place was very clean with the latest dental technology. I was even offered a coffee while I waited to be seen for my first visit but I didn't want coffee breath so I declined.<//Text>

My daughter had her teeth cleaned and my son even had his teeth pulled and didn't flinch from start to finish!

This was the BEST experience I have ever had at a dentist.  The dental hygienist was cordial and gentle, so gentle I didn't feel any pain at all during visit.  The office is high tech and I had the full work up for an initial visit. Full mouth and partial mouth xrays, cleaning, video images.  My family of 6 are definitely making Laguna Springs Dental our permanent dentist.<//Review>

I  have real phobias about dentists and recently went to two dentists in Elk Grove that were terrible experiences.   I am so glad I found  Dr. Mostafa! He is the real deal for being pleasant, caring, competent, and approachable.  His staff are equally helpful and the atmosphere he has set up really lends itself to creating  a feeling of well-being . From the massage chairs and scents of lavender to the scenic videos  playing to relax and distract you, everything is designed to put the patient at ease.   My hygienist, Glazel, was respectful and efficient, giving me a great cleaning and being sensitive to my fears. I just came for a cleaning and new patient visit but already Dr. Mostafa has gone above and beyond by fixing a wire on a brace that had broken a few hours after the cleaning visit.  He immediately got me in even though they were about to close. I look forward to more visits to this unique dental practice. ( What, did I say I was looking forward to a dental visit?! I think I did.)</Text>

<Review>I've never liked going to the dentist since I was a kid. I had a lot of dental work done when I was a kid so I was traumatized at an early age. When I moved up to Elk Grove, I was concerned I wasn't going to be able to find a dentist as good as the one I had in the Bay Area. After doing an exhaustive Yelp search, I came across Laguna Springs Dental. Not only did this dentist live up to all the positive Yelp reviews, they were even better than my previous dentist. Their office staff is very friendly and professional. Their dental hygienists are very skilled, and gentle on the teeth. The dentist is a very nice man who is thorough and cares about his patients. It's always a pleasure to go to this dentist, they do an amazing job. I won't be switching dentists, unless I move away from the area.</Review><rate>5< /rate><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809ac7012c638dad:0xf1b72e32831535a1</gmapID>< userid>

Dentist is gentle, nice and open minded.
Assistants are gentle and kind treating patients very respectfully.
Front office person also the same, very patient and caring looking to give the best offers around and the best service.
Thank you guys

I almost forgot to mention, their technology is the most advanced I have seen making the experience easier, safer and more comfortable for both the provider and the patient.< /text>

I usually don't review health providers, but this dental office was too unique not to talk about.

I needed cleaning and filling, and as every time I go to a dentist, I was nervous about the pain.

From the minute I entered the place, I felt it was quite different from other offices I have been to. It feels like you are in a high end spa... Very nice decor, colors and feel. They even have birds and nature sounds in the background, and their chairs have massage features... It really feels relaxing!

I was impressed with the doctor's bedside manners. Very good listener, and patient in explaining what went wrong with my teeth and the treatment he would use for that. He even pointed out my most economical options (very rare to find in a dentist!!). Don't be shy to ask if they can give you a payment plan.

During the procedure, the doctor paused from time to time to ask me how I was feeling and encouraged me to tell him if I had any concern or feel any pain. I really like that personal care and attention, versus feeling I'm on a conveyor belt, and rushed out the door (I'm sure a lot of people can relate to that lol ).

Overall, it was a great experience, with great people. I would recommend them to anyone!</Text>

At Laguna Springs Dental you will feel like you’re with caring friends. I love everything from the smile when you enter the front door to the gentle, caring touch of all that attend to your every need. I’ve been to many of dentist, but Dr. Mostafa is as great as they come, in the field of dentistry, he truly cares. Yelena always meets you with a smile and graciousness. Roma, Leslie, Brittainy, Glazel and Jennifer, will all make your visit a pleasurable one. Love this place! #BryanMartin #BCMfilms</Review>

I had always had problems with my upper front 2 teeth (chipping, weakening, etc) and all other dentists would just patch them up and I hated my smile. After seeing Dr. Mustafa, he provided the option to put crowns on, I never even knew that was an option!! The procedure was pretty painless and my smile is absolutely beautiful.
Thank you, thank you to this awesome team for providing such great care!<//Review>< username>

<Review>Gave them a call, walked in ten minutes later with myself and my son. We were instantly greeted at the door and in chairs getting haircuts within minutes. Bill and Daniel did amazing work, walked out very happy with the quality of our haircuts. Thanks for the great experience guys, definitely getting haircuts there from now on.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<review>Fast service. The barber has over 16 years of experience. Did a great job! Price was good too. $11 for a haircut. Barber did such a great job, we gave him $20. It was well worth it too. They do walk-ins too.<//review>< pictures>

They did okay with my husband's buzz and shave... Not the best, they didn't use a razor for the shave and he had to go back in for missed spots and to even it out. She apologized and fixed it</Text>

<Text>First time I went took my son it was good. Price was $12. Then second time I went it was $14 n the cut was ok. His grandma took him then it was $16. Price is what they want it to be. They take long and the guys all chatter like a bunch of women. It's pretty ghetto in there but what's to expect when it's in a ghetto location. I'm searching for a better barbershop.< /Text>< Rate>

If you want to get the best haircut go to Shirley or her husband (they're the owners). Shirley is highly experienced and is very polite. I've gotten a cut with the guys there but they take too long because they gossip a lot with their coworkers as they cut (not all but most of them). Avoid the gossipers at all cost.  Shirley knows best.< /text>

The best Barber Shop I have ever been in. They have 8 to 10 chairs and theirs a barber behind each one. There all very talented and depending on what style you want done, they'll guide you to the right person. The owner, Bill has the 2nd chair as you walk in and he's been there at least close to 3O years. Me being Retired Military, I just told him "High and Tight" and that was the best Zero Fade I've ever had anywhere and I've traveled the world.< /review>

I've given up here I can never get a good hair cut anymore. A lot of these guys are beginners or just starting it would balance out if they had other experience barbers</review>

No waiting got right in..the barber that did his taper cut was awesome! His chair is the 2nd from the door! He took the stress off of my son about cutting all his hair off..he had been in the military to..and also went above and beyond to give us a military discount because my son wants to be a marine. So last week I took my youngest son in who has a totally different style and he's so picky to! And we got the same barber as before and he rocked the hairstyle perfectly!!He definitely has skills..he has experience and knows what he's doing.it worth the few extra dollars to go here!we will definitely be going back.it was nice cause he remembered me to! Kudos to him.</review>< Pics>

I went in and looked for my barber for over 9 years and they wouldn't tell me ware he was at. FYI Mark is working at happy joes now, come threw its on Florida where the old stator brothers use to be by del taco. I personally think Mark is the best barber and highly refer you to get cut by my boy< /text>

<Text>My son had beautiful curls (long curls) i asked the old lady to to trim the the curls. She cut them all off. Myson had a afro but a Trim is what i ask hir her to do but she did what "she " wanted. I will never go back there. I thought My son told her to do it, but in the way home she told me she didn't say anything and just started cutting curl by curl. She sucks ass! Worst place in Hemet. Dont be a barber if you cant listen to the customer!<//Text>< response>

So I got the White dude with the tattoos. Because of the previous review I was nervous, but I've had people mess up my hair before because of the texture so I was whatever. Dude was receptive, asked questions, took his time, and my cut came out great. I was suprised. I'm peurto rican and my hair is difficult unless it's really long or buzzed. This dude hooked it up.<//Text>

I took my grand kids for dinner to Chuck E cheese's. This place is made for children to have fun, and the kids did have fun. While it was my 1st experience here, the children had been here many times before with their parents. The pizza is only  so, so, but the salad bar is fairly decent. Besides pizza, we also ordered a side of  celery, wings, bread sticks, and cheesy bread, with all the dips-- The girls demolished the breadsticks, and I loved the cheesy bread and wings. We all had salad which was very good.
The girls played for something called tickets which we turned in for prizes.  The place is chaotic, wild, and entirely fun for little ones.   I can't imagine a more fun place for little ones. As a grandparent, though, I had to keep my eyes alert at all times to watch out for my 2 little grand girls.</text>

I’m so happy Chuck E. Cheese is back open now my 2 kids can go have fun! I feel like Chuck E. Cheese has definitely started to clean up their place. Before Corona does anybody remember how dirty the floors and tables were. Well if you don’t remember or never noticed I’m saying that their floors are as clean as they can get and their tables are as clean as they can get!< /review>

<text>This is one of the cleanest Chuck-E-Cheeses I have ever been to. The staff was very friendly, Chuck E made an appearance, it appeared that all the tables were booked up for birthday parties. The pizza was pretty good for arcade Pizza, and I love the new card system that Chuck-E-Cheese has implemented for their tokens. I do wish they had a similarly simple solution for the tickets.< /text>< Pictures>

All the kids in the place seemed to be having a great time. The games are geared toward children. Although the adults all seemed to enjoy them as well. The staff was helpful and friendly. They give you enough room at the table for a large group. Chuck E Cheese comes out once for all of the kids having a party during that time and is out for about 10 minutes or so. Not a fan of the pizza. But the wings weren't bad. The party packages seemed reasonably priced. There was a sign saying on Sundays they have a sensory block for a couple hours, where anyone who is negatively affected by the bright lights and noises can come and enjoy a less bright and noisy atmosphere.< /review>

Great place to take the kids to.  It's friendly service and clean environment.  Games selection keeps getting better as well for the kids.</Review>

Our family had not been to the Salinas location is a year and boy were we pleasantly surprised!! We loved the upgrades that consist of new games, new carpet, new food option, etc.
Unfortunately, customer service was lacking . Staff did not seem to want to help assist customers with broken machines, staff taking their breaks at the ticket/prize booth, and salad bar messy while staff stood around to watch.
No packages for customers and can be very expensive for our family.< /text>

No longer has a children play structure. So it seems more like a kids Dave & Buster's. Basically a big building filled with arcade games. Not bad just not what I was expecting.< /Text>

<text>This Chuck E Cheese wad very mediocre. About half the games were turned off, broken or glitched in one way or another. I also believe that allot of games give out very little in tickets. As from what I saw that at the max you could get about 800 tickets from a $20 game card. However you can buy tickets at 1¢ a piece, which means with that same $20 you could buy 2000 tickets. So overall if you have kids who just want to play games then it's fine; if you have kids who want prizes be ready to dish out money on some overpriced "prizes". Many low cost prizes consist of this cheap bulk tiny toys marked up over %100 in price. The real positives are the food however as it is pretty decent taste and variation wise.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Employees are slow at what they do and lazy. They dont even smile or greet customers they look like they hate their job. I constantly had to keep asking for more cups and plates because they were being too cheap to give me exactly what the party needed all at once. Arcade games/ game cards are always having issues when you ask an employee for help they get angry and look annoyed. Horrible experience for my daughters 3rd birthday party.<//Text>< Pictures>

People that worked there seemed unhappy and at times annoyed, the pizza was overpriced and had a sweet rather than savory taste. Some of the arcades were broken but overall it was fun. I did like the 80s music videos and there was one girl who took our picture, she was sweet. Following chucky around the facility with my 4 year old was actually the highlight of the evening. Seeing my son smile is worth it. Remember its for the kids</Review>

It took about 20 minutes to be acknowledged while waiting to trade in my son's tickets for a prize. Multiple employees walked by but decided to look the other way and go talk to their friends instead.<//text>

<text>Place is so much better,someone  put a lot of work and make it presentable and clean. Staff is friendly and extremely attentive.Our party was a success,we had a great time and lot of fun.Definitely better to have  Birthday at Chuck E.

<Text>The staff is great we arrived late they still brought out chucky and sang happy birthday to our daughter. Very sweet of the two young men to do that for our daughter. Also it was our first visit to chuck e cheese and my husband and i are impressed with the system they have to only allow the child to leave with there parents. Only gave them four cause some of the machines did not dispence ticketts but overall great place.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<user_name>Tania Guillen<//user_name>< review>
I am so upset. I called rose hills the first week of Mother Day and I asked them when I should remove the stuff from my moms gravesite. The lady I spoke to advised me that on the 20th all things had to be picked up. I asked her more than one time and she assured me that the pick up date was on the 20th. To my surpirse, I went yesterday to go pick up my moms stuff and they threw everything away. I started crying because I bought my mom so many cute things to decorate for Mothers Day. This shouldve not happened and it did because the lady on the phone gave me wrong information. It was about 300 dollars worth of stuff. Everything was brand new and I am so disappointed because I previously had given 5 stars.<//review>

I have been going to Rose Hills for over 30 years to visit family members that are buried there. My mother had more than 20 plots that she had owned for family. It’s sad to think that as much money as my mother has put into Rose Hills that the maintenance is not very well.  When I go visit them I have seen tire marks over their headstones, I have seen dried out burnt grass as if it’s not being watered, it’s not being trimmed regularly both vases on my father‘s plot have been completely buried and I have to cut the grass just to be able to take them out. One time the stone actually sank in on one side when we had heavy rain and it was completely almost buried and I had reported it twice to be fixed and removed in writing and it took over a year for them to do it. The staff members are not very friendly actually I can say they’re heartless. On holidays such as Christmas or Father’s Day, Mother’s Day they should have other entrances to the cemetery available not just one main gate open and that’s it. I was in line for over an hour just to get in. That cuts into the time that I get to spend with my loved ones who have passed on. Today we were actually approached and told that we were not able to put up a canopy to protect ourselves from the harmful rays of the sun not knowing that we could be skin cancer survivors. They don’t even have adequate restrooms for the visitors. You would think with all the money that they’re receiving and continue to expand that they would at least think about the family members and friends who visit their facility. At one point in my life I actually wanted to be buried there myself with my parents but after all that I have been through at Rosehills I will not put any of my family members through any of the stuff that I’ve gone through. And since Covid they have a big canopy with chairs set up on the road that I take to see my parents and I have to go all the way around now to see them because they blocked it off.

I had an issue about 3 years ago where my mom’s flower pot was buried so deep and they fixed it right away and mailed me a letter notifying me it was fixed.  I live in Arizona.  A couple months later I was out here again and my Mom’s headstone had sank quite a bit.  Again I notified them of the issue. Of course they stated as there policy if it was anything to do with the plot we are responsible for the payment to repair.  They fixed my moms and again mailed a letter stating that it was there fault from a broken sprinkler. It’s hard to loose the ones you love but you also have to remember these people work everyday with grieving families don’t make there jobs harder by being rude or nasty, just be kind because they will always work with you to take care of you no matter what, but they also have bills and employees to pay so yes there are costs to be covered.

<Review>Other than the fact that the mortician did my grandmother's lips too thin (but it got plumped) the funeral went off without a hitch. Also their find-a-grave system is great to find the right area since it's such a huge place. It's such a peaceful place and their chapel... their chapel at sunset...</Review>< pictures>

<Review>We have been going to this cemetery for about 32 years now. We clean and maintain 6 family stones. We constantly have to complain about the lawn being dry. But what's worse is the horrible job they do with the weed whackers. See for yourself in the pic's posted. I had a few conversations with the mgr and I don't get the lack of attention given to the work. I'm generally not a complainer but these stones may not matter to them but these are our family members. I hope things get better going forward.<//Review>< userid>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>The Rose Hills experience I received was not stellar. There were a number of things Rose Hills dropped the ball on in preparation for my husband's services. Despite providing specific instructions, photos & requests, I had to contact Rose Hills several times the day before my husband's service and after! They failed to have my husband ready for my personal viewing appointment that had been set WEEKS prior. When I finally got to see my husband, he was unshaven despite clearly requesting he be shaven & providing photos for reference! At the service. I was handed an envelope that was supposed to have my husband's hair clippings & fingerprints. The fingerprints were missing! I once again had to call & email Rose Hills to let them know they had misplaced my husband's fingerprints. I did receive the fingerprints in digital & physical form, but the physical prints are unlabeled. For the amount of money, I paid for my husband's services NONE of this should have happened! Rose Hills needs to give our deceased loved ones the care, attention & respect they deserve. I understand Rose Hills employees are doing the best they can during the pandemic but things like this makes me feel like he was just another number to you.<//text>< Pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I buried both my parents at Rose Hills, my Mom in 2002 and my Dad in 2009 (The Grove Ext, plots 1104 & 1105). I visit them very frequently and manicure their area because the grounds maintenance does a very poor job. It’s pretty sad that I have to take with me my weed wacker, bin full of yard tools, water hose, etc etc. last week when I went to visit 5-19-21, my Moms plot was completely buried in mud, I filed a complaint with Rose Hills staff and was assured it would be taken care of. Today 5-25-21 I went back and the plot was still the same. I stopped a groundskeeper and asked why nothing had been done and he could not understand me speaking in English, he just said “GO OFFICE”. I then stopped Allied Security and asked for a office number I could call other than the one main number which kept me on hold for over an hour. The Security Guard also said that Rose Hills is so short handed that they (security) were tasked with replacing vases and various complaints. I have pictures of the tire tracks over my parents plots proving my complaint and will furnish upon request. I am seriously thinking about selling our other owned plots and buying elsewhere.

<Review>Rose Hills staff were wonderful, compassionate, kind, sincere and first rate in helping us arrange for my Mother's funeral.  We couldn't have asked for a better funeral director than Shannice.  Service above and beyond what we expected to receive.  No wonder they're so widely used.  They made a very difficult time as easy as possible for us.  We are forever grateful for their professionalism and courtesy.< /Review>< Rate>

My daughter was born in October 2020 and passed away two weeks later.  It is now mid April of 2021 and she still does not have a headstone, she is in an unmarked grave for over HALF A YEAR!!!  Emails are not being responded to by Angela Powell anymore, Brittany Madera has been telling me and my wife that it's the Marker department that is backed up.

Can anyone there help me and my wife out?

Everything was moving along until the Marker stage, this is taking way too long.<//review>

<Text>Because of COVID, everything is backed-up and moving very slowly! Our loved one went to Jesus December 21, 2020. Our second phone call from Rose Hills wasn't until January 17th! BUT, when the representative called she was so compassionate, helpful and patient. I think our conversation lasted almost 2 hours! She helped us take care of all of the "legal stuff" and all of the final arrangements. When we went to pick up the urn, everything went very smoothly. The staff was efficient, kind and compassionate.

Extremely sick of some of the employees attitude. I spoke to Veronica in The title's department, very taken back by her Horrible attitude, tone and overall experience. I had to speak to Grizelda who was great. A tip for Veronica, after burying Family here and requesting title for those properties, you shouldn't be rude to us. In fact count your Blessings you have a job. Hanging up on me was ignorant because on behalf of others you do this to who may not have strength to call back and report you, I'll gladly do it. Enjoy your day and I hope this company retrains you because you shouldn't be working with People who are mourning, at all.<//Text>

I can’t get over what a great experience we had with Rose Hills.  What should’ve been a difficult, confusing time, was everything but with Carmen and the Rose Hills staff’s help. I truly felt like Carmen was helping plan her own loved one’s memorial services.  On top of that, given the COVID situation, we were still allowed to have 72 people in attendance—chairs were set up with social distancing in mind and policies were set in place to protect attendees.  The outdoor Memorial Patio tent location is STUNNING.  I would’ve chosen the outside over the inside chapel if given the option.  The view, the water feature....just perfect.  We were celebrating the life of my father, and he would’ve loved everything about it.

The guys who set my father’s casket into the ground was respectful and gentle, giving us a very pleasant burial experience. The property is expansive and very well-maintained.  Its location allows for not only great views but also a nice breeze.   Something I know will be nice when we visit dad in the future.

I can’t recommend Rose Hills enough.  Thank you, Carmen and team, for being a part of our family in this difficult time.<//review>

Dear David Da Rosa,

The kindness and  compassion you showed us at a very sensitive time is much appreciated. You went out of your way taking us as guests into the beautiful park (Rose Hills) showing us all the available options. I know you put your whole self into making us feel comfortable. It is reassuring to know that those who work so hard achieve the recognition they deserve. We're very blessed to count you as a friend.  We will be highly recommending Rose Hills Services to our family and friends. Thank You again.</Review>

<text>I would like to commend Ms. Kristy Tran.  Ms. Tran is a wonderful young lady.  She is a very respectful person.  Knowledgeable, caring and great personality.  I felt so relax, just like how it feels when you are with someone you know.  She helped my husband and I find the piece of land where we will rest in peace, according to our needs.  (I hope many, many years from now) .  She did not stop showing us different areas, until we found the one we liked the most.

Ms. Tran also helped me select my funeral services, I'm happy with the package we put together.  she tried her best to give us the best deal.

I'm very happy she was assigned to help us.  I know we can count on her for anything we need.

Thank you.

Thank you.<//text><Name>Maria Torres<//Name><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>The initial customer service ,  up to the memorial service/burial was excellent.  that was back in mid january.  after everything was paid for, we were still in contact with our rose hill representative brian in finalizing the headstone design and wording.  for reasons unknown to us, all communication/contact ceased.  after numerous attempts to contact brian, without any return calls, we attempted to contact rose hill customer service.  that was over a month ago and we are now in mid april and still without any response from rose hills.  feeling frosted and frustrated, my sister dropped off a physical copy of the headstone design at rose hills this week after not receiving any response over the phone other than "we will get back to you" and "we have been busy".  we were informed by the front desk it will take another 10-15 days for a response.  we understand there is a pandemic  and there have been many deaths for rose hills to handle.  but the lack of response or any communications from the rose hill representative and customer service on our last leg of completing our mother's funeral arrangement is inexcusable.  what a way to run a business during one family's period of sadness   we would've easily rated rose hills a five star.  because of their bungling of the last leg of our mother's journey, they deserve no more than a one star.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I would give Rose Hills 6 stars if I could.  This is the most beautiful cemetery in the world with magnificent views.  We especially enjoyed the tour of the old Mausoleum where a scene from Terminator 2 was filmed.  The old mausoleum is an absolute gem!  Our experience with Rose Hills has been positive.  Hing Hong assisted my family with our purchases and we now consider each other friends.  He is someone we trust and would send him referrals.  He is knowledgeable and compassionate.  He has so much energy it's contagious.  God bless Hing and his family.  He is our angel and has done so much for our family.

<user_name>Aaron Jacoby< /user_name><Text>No one does it better than Rose Hills. For the last 40+ years, we've had memorial services held here, starting with my grandfather in 1976, and they never disappoint. Our most recent service was for my dad, Kenneth Lee Jacoby, who passed on Thanksgiving (11/26/20) and from the initial phone call to arrangements to burial, the professional courtesy and heart-felt condolences and sensitivity to the family are unmatched. In a world where cash seems to be king for most, Rose Hills went above and beyond in caring for the needs and wishes of my family. Communication was clear and present every step of the way and it is so appreciated beyond words, that I find rest in knowing we've entrusted our last wishes to Rose Hills. They truly have their act together!

<review>My dad suddenly passed away from an unexpected illness. He thankfully made arrangements years in advance at Rose Hills Memorial Park.  From the moment we called them to request a pick up at the hospital to the final vase that was placed in the ground at the end of the service, everyone that was involved in laying him to rest was exceptional.  The mortuary office specialists,  arrangements counselor, funeral director, and even the grounds specialists who kindly offered to place remaining funeral flowers in the vase and watered the grass (for priority closing), everyone was professional, compassionate, and gracious.  Many thanks to Elizabeth, Garrett, Janine, Anthony and Mario.  I may have left out a few others who attended to us, but we appreciate your work more than words can express.< /review>< Rate>

When my grandmother passed away, our family didn’t know what to do.  My best friend referred me to Cecilia Chan who is a Family Support Advisor at Rose Hills. She was also helping my best friend for her father’s funeral.  Cecilia is very detail-oriented, professional and compassionate.  She provided us with all the details and guided us through the whole process during our difficult time.  After my grandmother funeral, we understand how important it is to have pre-planning.  Cecilia helped us for our family pre-planning and we know that she will take care us the same way she took care my grandmother.  We are happy we found Cecilia and highly recommend her professional service.< /text>

<text>The cemetery itself is beautiful but I'm not happy with what happened and how the situation was handled. my father was left at the hospital for 6 days after he passed, They can't answer as into why, they blame the hospital, I was on hold over 5 hours trying to reach someone to find out why my dad was not picked up. I had supervisor's from hospital call me and asked me why my father was not picked up,  I filled out a claim for someone to call me back because I was very concerned , I literally got a phone call like 1 week later. they still charge me transportation fees. I understand their is a pandemic, but instead of getting automated text asking me if I wanted to embalmed my father when he was not even there they should make it personal and make a phone call. not a text.  They have a lot of money with all that they charge they should hire more people. I have more to say but one review and the more I say wont change anything. just venting on how I feel about Rose Hills customer service<//text></record></dataset><record>

My mother and I had to purchase a plot recently for my fathers unfortunate passing. We had a wonderful sales agent, Dianne Brooks who took really good care of us. She showed us around patiently to help us see which location within the cemetery we wanted him buried. She then, stayed in the location well after closing time to make sure that the purchase was finalized. She then would take time out of her day off to call my mother and see how she was doing emotionally, even after the process was finished. She made sure we had all of our questions answered. She was a complete Angel with the whole hassle of burying my father, and surely made things so much easier for us in our moment of despair.  She also helped us get the soonest possible date for the burial and services. if she wouldn't of had been there for us, we would have had to wait a whole month after my father's demise, to bury him and hold the services, and we really did not want that.
Rose Hills Mortuary is also a beautiful cemetery. very peaceful, enormous, and very clean. They are also doing their best at keeping distance and cleaning midst this coronavirus going on. the chapels are all very beautiful, and the service we had a was beautiful.< /Text>

<Review>I’ve always had the best experience with Rose Hills. Especially with their staff member, Amy Tsai. She is smart and extremely resourceful, accommodating, respectful and anticipates all of my needs. She’s helped me with funeral planning for my grandma and even was there the day of the funeral to ensure the day was easy and as it could be. Amy shares knowledge related to cultural needs, traditions, ethnic background customs, religion, and age practices. I was able to qualify for financing to afford the costs too, ask about these programs. Amy even helped coordinate with all the other Rose Hills staff members for me, for a personalized experience. I’ve recommended her services to all my family and friends. She will exceed your expectations. Most importantly, she is personable while respectful and actually listens to what our needs are, budgets and family wishes and will always get you the best deal. Rose hills cemetery is very clean and well kept, a final resting place of choice for me. It’s best to plan ahead to make it easy for your loved ones.</Review><user_id>111770033327539743568</user_id>< Rating>

First of all, the memorial park was beautiful.
My father was the first member of the family to pass away.  Without any prior experience, I did not know what to do at that time.
Luckily, I met the sales consultant Miss Cecilia Chan in the City of Industry office.  Miss Chan was very kind and attentive.  She helped us select a plot and arranged the service.
Throughout the process, she was there for everything.  She always responded when I called. On the day of the burial, she even came to the service to help.
Later she also helped me select a plot for my own preplanning.  When I told her about my autopayment issue, she even coordinated with the accounting dept to solve all my problems.  I am very happy with the service that Rose Hills and Miss Cecilia Chan provided.< /Text>

Excellent service.  David da Rosa at Rose Hills was great to talk to, he worked with my busy schedule and he took his time in answering all my questions with the utmost respect and patience.  And I had A LOT of questions.  David gave me details that I had not thought of myself and made sure I had all the information I needed.  I highly recommend Rose Hills and if you can speak to David da Rosa for a loved ones final arrangements, you will be very impressed.  Needless to say, I felt so comfortable and at peace with my decision for our family plot that did complete the purchase the same day with Rose Hills.< /Text>

We visited Rose Hills for the first time in June because my grandfather was ill.  It was extremely difficult for us to arrange this during such emotional times.  Picking a spot for my grandfather was heart wrenching, not to mention we have not gone out to shop for anything since March.

Rose Hills employees made us feel safe, our purchase was done online.  Hing Hong gave us many choices without any pressure.

My grandfather passed away in August.  In regards to the services, they have multiple white tents.  Reminded me of outdoor weddings in Asia.  It was breezy and my grandfather's funeral was filled with heart warming speeches. We were heartbroken but we got closure that day.

I was impressed to witness Rose Hills implementing social distance and safety guidelines.  My family felt safe.  On the day of the burial, the dirt was already dug up and the process was quick, I still find it hard to believe that my grandfather is no longer here.

I feel like Rose Hills go above and beyond their services and definitely exceeded my expectations. I would think there are many heroes here that go unrecognized, Hing Hong and his team would be heroes in our hearts.<//text>

<Review>I was highly disappointed with the service and concern that I received during this most difficult time. No sympathy, no compassion.  Rose Hills has definitely lowered their standards especially in the employees. I dealt with them 6 years ago when my daughter passed and now recently when my husband passed. Definitely not the same service. The employees were not helpful, didn’t return calls or emails, only when it came to them getting their money. Employee who showed us the property location looked like he dug the grave himself. His black suit was so dirty it was brown and faded. He rushed the whole appointment even after we asked him to relax several times. When it came to dropping off my husband’s clothes the representative who took it was so rude almost as if I was disturbing her. This whole experience has really scared me. Definitely would not recommend them.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1605025620718, 'text': 'Sylvia, we care deeply about ensuring we exceed your expectations during what I know is an incredibly difficult time and I would be grateful for a chance to connect with you and discuss your concerns further.

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>My grandmother is buried at Rose Hills, we visit often, its tranquil here.  Where else can you go for unobstructed Los Angeles view while remembering your family members. My dad's friend Hing Hong helped us with our purchases.  We came during May when LA was just starting to re-open.  We met with Mr. Hong and his supervisor Lin under a red canopy tent.  My family had many complicated questions and Mr. Hong answered them all with professionalism and patience.

Mr. Hong presented my family with many selections first using a laptop, that came along with prices. We were able to  view a variety of plots before we came to our decision on which ones to visit in person.  There was no sense of trickery or guilt trip during this process.

I wanted to say thank you to Mr. Hong for keeping social distance during our visit, he guided us to sit under a canopy, and we felt safe.  We were comfortable dealing with him.  Our family appreciates you all.  Rose Hills is beautiful and to our surprise, our plot was affordable, we did not realize we can make monthly contributions, what a pleasant surprise.  Thank you Mr. Hong!<//Review>< Pictures>

I greatly appreciate that I was able to temporarily entomb my father during the pandemic.  I don't know of any other mortuary that offered this option.  If you are asking me to rate the service at Rose Hills before my father's funeral I'd say a 1 star, but if you are asking me to rate the service the day of the funeral I would say 5 stars.  My father died in April, but was not buried (by choice) in November.  I spoke to at least 3 people the week after he died and they all had something different to say.  The right hand wasn't talking to the left hand.  There was so much confusion that I asked to speak with a supervisor.  When my coordinator called the following week I spent about 1.5hrs on the phone.  We went over all the details regarding my father's service and the options I had due to the pandemic.  When I was ready to plan his funeral, it was impossible to make any plans.  I sent emails, left voicemails and it would take up to 4 days to get a response.  Even a week before the funeral I could not get an answer to my questions.  I spoke to her 3 times during the planning, but it was in between clients so our conversations were very brief.  I spoke to her 1 week before my father's funeral and never spoke to her again. Either she didn't know how to manager her time or Rose Hill's needs to hire more employees, but NO one should go through the stress that I went through to plan a funeral.  I felt as if I wasn't important since our plots had been paid for 20 years earlier.  The day of the funeral I had an exception funeral director.(Nicholas Ochoa)  Compassionate, informative and respectful.  We reviewed the funeral services 2 days before and I found out that there was additional services I was getting the day of the funeral that were never told about. He arrived early at the tent and stayed with me to the very end.  Your location is lovely, but you have terrible customer service. The wait times on the phone are too long and it's very difficult to get any help.</review>

I'm glad that my friend Debbie Nasir introducing RoseHill for my permanent place and investment...in this earth.
She is a good,educative and knowledgeable counselor.
I'm commending her for her professionalism and caring person.
RoseHill should be proud of her.
Thank you and God bless you</Review>< Pictures>

I want to thank Amy Tsai for the wonderful experience while at Rose Hills. She was incredibly understanding and patient as she was helping us find exactly what we were looking for. She spent hours showing us all the different locations at Rose Hills and spent a lot of her own time to thoroughly go through each location and gave us detailed information and gave lots great recommendations.  Amy was genuine, kind and very helpful throughout the whole process. I highly recommend Amy Tsai!</review>

<review>I think one of the most stressful times in life is when death hits unexpectedly and you’re left with planning a funeral but with no knowledge of what to do. All I can say is Shannon Kriska is a phenomenal funeral counselor. Her professionalism and empathy made this experience of purchasing and finalizing the burial, an easy process. I was shopping around other cemeteries but nothing compared to her great service and this is why I choose Rose Hills. If you are pre-planning or looking into an at need counselor Shannon Kriska is the one for you ! Shannon goes above and beyond in customer service, SHES a perfect example of what you want in a funeral counselor.<//review>< Pictures>

Having to contact a Cemetery for my father’s burial has been emotionally the hardest thing I’ve had to do in my life. I had to do all the arrangements all by my self since I’m an only child and I was clueless to what needed to be done or how things worked? My cousin recommended me to Mr. H. Hong family support advisor/cemetery sales representative. When I called him he immediately showed his respect and expressed his condolences. This meant a lot to me because it showed me he cared for how I was feeling. I had just lost my father to Covid and my biggest fear was to loose my mother who was also at the hospital fighting the virus. I was an emotional wreck, but Mr. Hong helped me through by making the experience less of a burden. He was very attentive to all my questions (I made many) and explaining everything clearly. Once we when to see the plots I was amazed at how beautiful Rose hills Cemetery is. It was breathtaking, clean and so peaceful that it calmed my feelings of distress and changed my whole outlook of what I was about to do, finding my father’s  resting place. After looking at a few places I found the perfect place. Mr. Hong mentioned a discount they were offering so I decided to get two more resting plots next to my father’s witch allows me to pay in monthly payments. I also want to mention Ms. J.Phoebe sales arrangement specialist  who was very kind and pleasant. At the moment of payment even after contacting my bank to give a heads up of a large payment transaction their was still an issue releasing the funds to Rose hills but Ms.Phoebe made the process less stressful and worked with me in making partial payments from different accounts until it was all taken cared of. To conclude, my fathers service was beautiful. I’m glad I chose Rose Hills memorial park and I’m happy to say my mother was released form the hospital and is recuperating well.<//Text>

Although Rose Hills has always been a part of my life whenever a beloved passed away, I’ve always been very much involved in participating in the memorial services and never having the chance to meet  someone who works for the mortuary.  Until I came across my students’ parent, Ms. Yvonne Wang.  She took me by surprise when she casually hands me her business card and spoke to me very naturally about her line of work and immediately informed me about the special discounts available.  Ms. Wang definitely knew her trade well and conveyed the discounts and proceedings very clearly.  She has me start a conversation with my parents.  Her sales style is assertive yet comfortable.  I’ve enjoyed her presentations very much and I’ve also tried to connect her with my social circles.<//Review>

Prior to her death my mother set up her funeral with Rose Hills. She made the arrangements she wanted far in advance of he death. Rose Hills fulfilled every one of her request within the guide lines of the current covid 19 situation.
Their employees were all caring and showed complete respect for my family and my mother.
We have several family members in the Rose Hills cemetery, and arrangements have been made for many more.
Thank You to all the folks from Rose Hills.<//review>

<review>Recently, my family and I had to look into burial properties in preparation for my father’s passing. It was our first time making this type of purchase, so we had no idea what to consider or look for going in. Our agent Mr. Hing Hong patiently showed us around the cemetery with detailed explanations at each site and made sure he answered all our questions. He even went out of his way and met us at the hospital because we were unable to be at the Whittier Rose Hills office to finalize the contract. After the purchase was completed, he would check in with us on the funeral arrangements to make sure that we were offered services that would best fit our needs and got us the best price. He was very considerate of my family’s needs during this difficult time and that was a key reason why we felt so comfortable purchasing from Mr. Hong. If and when my friends need this service, I will definitely refer them to Mr. Hing Hong.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My family’s and I had the worst experience with this cemetery. The people are insensitive and in our view unprofessional. I have had better experiences buying used cars then laying my family member to rest. I do not recommend this place and if I had the means to remove my family I would do it with in a blink of an eye.
The company name sounds nice but it is nothing more than a conveyor belt at a huge expensive cost. Go anywhere else.</text>

Our family isn’t new to Rose Hills a lot of my moms family members are interred there. Years ago my parents purchased their burial plots and the counselor we had was not knowledgeable of what she was selling. She told us the properties my parents were purchasing we were  going to have two interments in each space. Years later we found out that wasn’t true, she didn’t include the specific details on the contract. Fast forward to June 2019 our family had the pleasure of working along with someone new to us, our Service Counselor Ms. Kristy Tran. With the promotions the Memorial Park was having at the time my parents added a second interment to their burial properties, purchased their funeral packages. Kristy took her time with us, she didn’t rush us. Answered all of our questions, patiently went over every detail prior to signatures and method of payment.

Rose Hill is a very peaceful place and we decided to have our eternity home there with the help of agent Cecilia Chan. Cecilia shows us to different sections of the park.  She listens to what we want and give us her professional comment.  No pressure on the purchase at all. We are very comfortable with this experience. Thanks again!</text>

<text>The whole process was very good, our advisor Jenny did an amazing job, advising and answering questions.  The staff is amazing.  My mom's services were beautiful until the port-o-potty's had to be cleaned.  They decided to do that in the middle of my mom's services.  Other than that everything was amazing.< /text><rating>5< /rating><date>1602085462933< /date>< userid>

< review>
My mom died a couple days after 9/11..The whole nation was reeling from those events.. then she died suddenly..My poor dad was in autopilot mode while making the arrangements. The morning of her funeral we as a family were driving up to the main gates of Rose Hills..no one had spoken a word during the ride.. Then there, standing in the mist under a tree, was a whole family of deer to great us. My dad said, "I feel so much better now." He was old school..didn't show emotions..but his voice cracked and he wiped his eyes. Mom would be happy here..</review>

I had wonderful experience with my family support advisor Cecilia Chan. From arranging my husband’s funeral to my own pre planning service. She is extremely knowledgeable and professional. I am truly grateful for her help. Highly recommended.< /review>

Rosehills is beautiful and quiet. I have been planning to buy a plot at Rosehills and wasn’t sure where to start. I called few times and was not comfortable to the agents I spoke to until I spoke with Kristy Tran. From beginning to end of the application and the tour it was a smooth sail. She’s really nice and helpful. Thanks to Kristy, I am now part of RoseHills.<//Review>

Thank you for your surburb professionism on my husband Ronald Mickens funeral.. From the beginning of this journey when my sister in law contacted Rose Hills Mortuary Mr. Lynn went beyond to assist me with every question and took the time out to help my family. Mrr. Lynn was surburb. Hey went beyond the call of duty. During the ceremony Mr. Nicholas and the other staff members were surburb. They were so sensitive to my needs and the whole entire family. My husbands body was extremely well put togeter. He looked so peachful and natural. My family was extremely pleased. Rose Hills Mortuary was dynatmite in making this event as peaceful and well put together. My husband had Doves at his ceremony and this man was extremely kind and loving. He took the time to explain the meaning of the Doves to my grandbaby girl. The entire ceremony was surburb and every employee involved made this sad occasion pleasant and peaceful. There aren't enough words to express how grateful my whole family was for this perfect ceremony, funeral. Thank you again for all the extra hard wodk put out their by ALL your employees involved. All your hard work has not been overlooked. Thank you again and again. God Bless<//Review>

My husband died about a year ago.  We had a small service and reception at Rose Hills.  From the point where they picked him up from the coroner to when we had the service, they were professional and supportive.  They made the process easy at a time when I needed as few complications as possible.  My father is also buried there.  They’ve kept his grave site and indeed the place beautiful.< /Review>

My mother passed away on 3/13/2020.  The family has 6 plots purchased many years ago.  When my father passed away 30 years ago, she purchased an individual marker for herself.  When I went to make arrangements for my mother, they had no record of her purchase.  Fortunately, I found the receipt, along with a letter from Rose Hills stating that it was made and where it was stored; however, the ORIGINAL MARKER WAS LOST.  They said they would provide a new one.  Months later they installed a new marker, but it had an INCORRECT INSCRIPTION.  Months after this, I was told a correct one had been installed.  But again, another lie.  I went to visit and the incorrect marker was still there.  We couldn't have a burial or funeral for my mother, because of the pandemic, which is understandable, but 8 MONTHS LATER AND THIS IS STILL NOT RESOVED.  I ADVISE EVERYONE "DO NOT" PURCHASE ANYTHING IN ADVANCE.   Not only do I think it's unsympathetic and rude to ask grieving customers, while they are making arrangements for their loved ones, to plan their own demise, it's unwise.  Seems to be a ploy to get your money in advance knowing that the records might be lost and re-purchased unknowingly when the person actual dies.
Overall this has been a  stressful ordeal.  I CONTINUOSLY HAVE TO FOLLOW-UP.  There were also delays with the death certificates and miscommunication on other issues.   I wish our family plots were located at smaller local cemetery.  They seem to have more empathy and understanding towards the families needs. And they keep up the landscaping maintenance.  Whenever I visit, I need to have clippers and tools with me.  Also, I need to remember the flower removal day because they will throw out brand new flowers...doesn't matter if it's their birthday, etc.
I also know others who have and still are experiencing negative ordeals with Rose Hills.  I truly believe Rose Hills is more focused on financial gain then focus on the concerns of their clients!</text>

While a cemetery may not sound like a place you would typically visit on vacation, Rose Hills Memorial Park is home to the largest one in North America.

This 1,400-acre park and cemetery – which is over 100 years old – is a beautiful, peaceful landscape featuring several mausoleums, a Buddhist pagoda, and a lovely chapel.<//review>

As a prearranged customer of Rosehills, with prior great service received, it is very unfortunate to leave 3 stars as a review, especially during this pandemic and the challenges we all face. However, the need to let people know first hand, our recent experience, is the right thing to do. We do understand a delay in laying our loved one to rest, especially during this globally impacted time. It took over three weeks to lay our mother to rest due to scheduling issues on Rosehills’ end. Meanwhile, other mortuaries and memorial parks were more efficient and timely in rendering their internment services.

Our prearranged services obviously had to be modified to comply with covid protocol. Yet, the encumbered fees were fully charged, without any refunds for services not utilized. On the day of the service all was going smoothly as we hoped, except for another oversight on the part of Rosehills. It is a small oversight, but lends to the lack of attention our family expected or received. The memorial cards we ordered were not given to us to distribute to our family and friends. When we brought this up with the representative, he told us we didn’t pay for any cards and proceeded to show us a printout of what was included. I kindly asked to have someone contact me as I didn’t want to draw any more attention than he’d already done.

After the burial, when most had already left, this gentleman realized his mistake, and told us the cards were still at his office. Thankfully, we received the cards, but the run of the mill treatment we received from the beginning of this experience, until the end, left more disheartened feelings. There was no guidance from any Rosehills staff members, including our long time sales representative. What we took away from this was much disappointment and a need to alert others. We plan to move the remaining prearranged services we have away from Rosehills along with the several other properties we own there.< /Text>

It is painful to even give one STAR to Rose Hills Memorial Park.  My beloved mother recently passed away and because she care so much for us and did not want to burden us with the monument expense, she financed in advance since 2009 and paid in full.  She worked at a Dry Cleaner and made every single payment for the monument with an interest rate of 9.9% given by RH Cemetery Corp (I guess Rose Hills is in the Finance business as well).

Since the death of my mother, I have been trying to place the order for the Monument she paid with her hard earn money.  However, Rose Hills Interment Office Department for whatever reason does not want to place the order.  I have either spoken or directed to 4 different Associates (Austin, Michael, Lauren, can't remember the 4th person name) who promise me they will call me back to place the order, but never received one single call back from any of the Associates.  Therefore, I decided to speak with the Manager, Joshua Ramirez.  We had a conversation and once again, I was promised by Joshua that my mother's case will be a priority on his list and he will PERSONALLY look into it and CALL ME BACK within 24 hours with an update.  And guess what??!!!  He NEVER call me back either. I guess management at Rose Hills train the Associates to NEVER call back your customers.

So, I decided to speak with someone above Joshua Ramirez.  I was told that his name is Scott Mitchell.  I called Scott Mitchell extension, but of course no answers and no way to leave a voicemail. The phone keeps ringing, but no answer nor it is setup for voicemail, very convenient.  Basically, I am left with nobody to talk to.

Finally, I decided to cancel the contract and ask for a full refund so we can place the Monument with a different company.  So, I call back to the interment office and told them I want to cancel the contract and request for a full refund.  I spoke with Nichole who transfer me to Jessica in the Business Office who will be handling the refund.  And guess what, the Business Office told me that they could offer a partial refund because the contract was too OLD (Like we all can predict when we are going to die.  If this is the case, then they should not pre-sale funeral arrangements), and for the full refund I need to speak with the Interment Office.  Basically, I am being shuffle from one department to another until I get tired of the situation and finally give up or accept a partial refund.  This is the perfect SCAM not to deliver on the service already paid since 2009 or send you away with a fraction of the hard earn money my mother paid for. I can't believe that Rose Hills has the nerve to offer only partial refund when in fact, the $7500 my mother paid back in 2009, today, it will be worth much more.  Rose Hills was holding onto my mother's money earning interest and now, they only want to give a portion of that money.  Please tell me that this isn't right.

I am going to fight this until the end of it for my mother's hard earned cash.  Rose Hills is taking advantage of my poor mother in her grave and it is not fair.  Rose Hills should be ashamed of their business practices of pre-selling funeral arrangements and not delivering on their promises or telling you that you will only get partial refund because the contract is too OLD.  Please, do not pre-purchase anything from Rose Hills.  Otherwise, you will suffer the same pain I am going thru right now.  I hope my long review will prevent many of you out there making funeral arrangements for your love ones at Rose Hills.

Regards,
Andrew Kim< /Review>

<Review>During this very difficult time, Rose Hills consults failed to follow through from start to finish. There was an email sent after midnight on the day my mother passed away that required a timely response; 24 hours. It was the permission to embalm and information needed for the death certificate. Who’s checking personal emails for important information such as this during this difficult time? No one said to look for this information at a certain time nor did anyone follow up with a phone call to inquire about the missing and important item after this 24 hour deadline.
The counselor I was assigned was no help at all. She lack the ability to walk me through the thorough steps in my mother’s pre planned and paid in full contract. I had to ask questions of her. She had 10% of the answers. Very poor customer service.
Their staff referred to my mother as “he or your father”. This was troublesome, because the counselor failed to identify my mother’s gender in any and all paperwork. If that box wasn’t checked, they should be taught to say, “loved one”, instead of trying to guess if the decease’s is female with a gender neutral name!
This upset me to no end that exactly 9 reps referred to my mother as “he”. The only person that got it right was a funeral director by the name of Ty (Tyron). Of the 9, only 2 were supervisors who still failed to return my calls or confirm my questions. Just not a good experience at all. Ty was the epitome of an A-1 class service professional. He was caring, responsive, attentive to our ever need.
Overall I would say Rose Hills should have better training for their counselors before they are assigned to clients.<//Review>< Pictures>

Making funeral arrangements are difficult, for a loved one or for oneself. So it makes sense to pre-plan the arrangement when decisions can be made under calm and unpressured conditions, not clouded by emotions. Sophie was helpful, knowledgeable and sensible, giving way to a smooth process. Thank you.</Text>

<Review>If I could give NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD!!! I always liked Rose Hills up until Thursday 8/27/2020! It was my Dear Aunts Funeral at first everything seemed okay but then it started feeling REALLY RUSHED and I thought to myself wow this isn’t okay what’s going on?! In a few minutes I realized that right next to us there was another service starting, I couldn’t believe it. As we start to lower my aunts body the man had to stop so he wouldn’t make any noise with the tractor because of the other service starting.So now we are left waiting in the sun for a long time for the other service to finish so we can finish burying my aunt, THIS IS NOT OKAY!!!! Why couldn’t they wait for us to finish with our aunts service since we started first!!! It was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER to be there in the moment honoring my Aunt and for it to but cut like that is so cruel and insensitive to our feelings, mind you this is a very touchy moment for a family and I thought your personnel would be professional enough to understand that but I guess not your personnel lacks professionalism and ability to schedule correctly!! NO FAMILY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Not only that but you would think that because of the pandemic and social distancing that you wouldn’t have a two services right next to each other, the other family had to walk through us to get to their site.. If you’re reading this please reconsider, Rose Hills doesn’t care, the reason I wrote this post it to save other Family’s from the heartache....it’s too late for our family :(< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1598900396671, 'text': 'Lily, thank you for brining this to our attention as this is not the impression we wish to leave you with.

< review>
When my father passed away, we were not prepared and did not know what to do.  Rose Hills and their excellent staff helped us lessen the burden and guided us to go through the difficult time without any problems.  From the selection of the burial sites to the final lowering and backfill of my father's grave, they took care of everything and more.  We were very satisfied with their services, especially with Mr. James Kim, who helped us from the beginning to the end of the funeral service.  Thank you very much.  Without the sincere and comforing support from Rose Hills, it could have been more difficult to overcome the loss of our father.  Even with the COVID-19 pandemic precautions, we were able to say goodbye to our father and have a meaningful funeral service for our family.  They have arranged everything so we can be comfortable while sending our father away.  So, my family and I thank them for everything they did for us.  Thank you again.</review>

To Whom it May concern,

We only have the best of words to express how fortunate and grateful we are; to have Rosehill’s whole team helping us while my mom pasted away on July of this year.

John Wong, who helped my mom’s funeral arrangement, he is very detailly, patience, efficiency, kind and knowledge.

Allen Chen and Stanley, both did a wonderful job to organized my mom’s funeral services with our Chinese Custom on July at Sky Rolls Hill Chapel,  Our family were very impressive the services and their effort. They made our family comfort and please.

Amy Lai and Betty Tze, are our family favorize, we bought a funeral arrangement from them a few months ago, glad we did. They answered any questions anytime we have, they always smile, kind, great attitude and provide an excellent services. I strong believer that Amy and Betty deserves a recognition.  Because of their outstanding services, my husband and I bought a lawn and Pre-arrangement from them,  I also referred one of my sister bought a lawn from them.

I will continue to refer people to Amy and Betty.

I am very proud of your Rose Hill Team. They are the Best!

Thanks!

There should be negative stars for placrs luke this. Had our 1 year old sons celebtration of life here at the chapel ontop and they didnt have projector working and we paid an extra 1000 for them to hold his urn with his ashes over night and take to our church the next day and when they deliveres it to church his urn had a chip on it and they said it must have happen when they transported it down the hill last night at Rose Hills. So they said oh well give you back the 1000 for leaving the urn overnight and then wantes us to go buy another urn and they would pay us for it, so we told them no you will go buy the exact one and drop it off at our house. Would never go there again!<//Review>

This experience pales in comparison with the ones in the past. After,my initial phone  appointment I couldn't reach my funeral  arranger to correct errors and  omissions on my docusign. It took 9 days with the help of a supervisor. The site I chose had a water leak and the viewing site was changed to a lovely chapel to bad the funeral wasn't able to be hekd there. As soon as the funeral arranger contacted me to correct her errors she sent a bill without explaining any payment options. This should have been done at the initial  funeral arrangement . I have my parents,
grandparents, and siblings buried and setvices held at Rose Hills and never experienced anything like this. There us no excuse for an arranger with a direct line, a business line, and email not getting back to grieving  family. If I had to do it all over I would only do the burial because I purchased plots many years prior.</Review>

My family has dealt with rose hills for 15 Years I’ve always loved it until this last service for our most recent loved one, first phone call Gabriella and Victoria they were great the attention to detail was nice, Chris the sales rep. Great guy.
Until we got to our arranger Derek started off good but after that He was too busy with his personal issues and does not return emails or call back request.
Our loved ones service was in the wrong tent from where he originally told us, all siblings signed in person and in DocuSign for paperwork process needed Twice Because Esther told us they couldn’t find the first copies (btw Esther lied to us as to when she sent the emails and after Asking 3 times and me staying on the phone with her until we recv. them for the second time) on the day of the service they had to sign again for the third time because Derek seems to be clueless as to what is going and now caused the cremation to be delayed and still have not heard back from anyone.  Now we need to cross our fingers and hope the certificates were handled properly as requested from day one. Icing on the cake yesterday we recv. A email survey for feedback so here you go.

The assistance at the service really was helpful and organized along with the flowers delivered.  The cosmetic team did a great job and made her look beautiful as she deserved.  It is unfortunate that I have to write this review and over shadow everyone’s else’s work due to others .
Please do not respond to this review asking for my phone number and best time to reach out to our family as you have all of our information just ask Derek and Esther!  We are not looking for excuses as we recv. Lots of those already.</Text>

Losing a loved one is the hardest experience.  We have had the greatest help from Cecilia Chan at the hardest times we've experience.  No matter what our question was, Cecilia responded promptly, even on her days off.  She has been there to guide us through the planning process, during the services and any time after.  Cecilia Chan is truly Rose Hills greatest asset.

When my father was in critical condition, I found Grace, she helped me understand the process, options, found the best location, and had everything prepared in just few days.  After my father passed away, she helped me to go through the process step by step, guided me, helped me contact the different teams, having the process went smoothly.   I contacted her on the evening, over the weekend; she was always there, answered my questions, helped me, supported me.  She is very patient, understanding the sorrow heart; no push, no complaint, just there to help!    You can feel Grace’s sincere and kind heart!

She is also helping a lot on purchasing our place and services.  She provided very details on different plans, discussed with us about our needs, gave the best deals.  She cares about her customers, works with customers.  Even now, we continue receiving greetings and updates on services from Grace.

When my mother passed away recently, I felt lost and helpless. I didn’t know what to do, who to call to start the process. Patricia Mendoza was heaven sent. After talking to her on the phone, she connected me with the right person who was in charge of scheduling her body for pick up from the hospital. She stood on the phone with me and guided me every step of the way. She made sure we were connected to the right people, reminded me of my Appt for burial services, met us there to make sure we were comfortable, took us on the tour of the cemetery to where my mothers plot was, kept reassuring us that my mother was in good hands....🙏🏽❤️ And she was.... Rose Hills is such an amazing place. Patricia’s customer service skills were very appreciated by not only myself, but family and friends. She is very empathetic towards the loss of a loved one. She has unique and positive customer focused skills that set her apart from others and it is appreciated by all who have been blessed to have received her positive customer service. Thank You Rose Hills for allowing us to have such a great person, Patricia Mendoza, guide us through our mothers services! 🌹</text>

<Review>A death is an event that you need to have compassionate people take you by the hand and patiently and compassionately guide you through the process.  The two lovely ladies that helped me were Nina Camacho and Wonder Luem.   Nina helped me make all of the decisions and offered recommendations when I asked her.  I was able to have my mother’s photo from when she was young and her own words beneath it, and as she said, she was going home to be with Jesus, where there is no sorrow.  The day of our graveside service was made perfect by the pastor from her church and we had help from the gentleman in charge there.  Changes I would have liked were:  the lady who sang my mother’s hymns needed actual music (sound).  I would have liked more chairs and maybe a larger tent, plus a stand for her photograph.  The all white flowers on her casket were more beautiful than any I’ve ever seen at a wedding.  We took them to her home for the reception and I later made arrangements for my two daughters and myself; they lasted a week.  Lastly, God sent Wonder to our home this week and she went through the next step, along with a planning guide.  She was so much more than an employee of Rose Hills - a former pastor and a lady who guided me through the next steps, along with important steps in life.  Thank you all, the family of Ruby and her daughter, Cynthia.</Review>< Resp>

It was an absolute pleasure having Grace Lo assist us with my family and friends needs for the last 10 years. She is always professional and takes time to walk us through what we’re looking for.  She is very knowledgeable and treated each person with the same respect, no matter your budget.  Every friend or family I refer to her has nothing but positive feedback of her service.  I would highly recommend Grace to help you with your needs.<//review>

My family and I loved the service provided to us at Rose Hills Cemetery. Veronica Fierro was very helpful, friendly and patient with my family providing us with exceptional customer service. She made us feel comfort and peace during our time of grievance as she helped us prepare everything to peacefully lay our loved one to rest. She is a great employee full of compassion and love for what she does and I’m glad we got to work with her.</Text>

<text>During the time of family loss, we had received full support from Rose Hill service providers. Although it was a difficult time for us, agent Grace Lo had helped to make it easier for our family.
She was compassionate. She was proactive in leading the entire process. Even few months after the funeral, she made a follow up call just to make sure our re-visitation experience was smooth.
Grace will be very successful in any service oriented industry. Don’t loose her!< /text>< user_id>

Mary Li was amazing! She helped my family find a beautiful plot that over looks the city. She was attentive, professional, and answered all of our questions.

We had some concerns initially about purchasing so early. But Mary made us feel comfortable and happy with the great deal. Now I feel secure knowing that if anything happens, everything is planned out. I highly recommend working through her and Rose Hills!<//text>

<Name>Cindy Lance</Name><review>We always knew planning ahead was the right thing to do for my family. Our family is multi ethnic and it was not easy to initiate this discussion. We looked at a few options for cemetery plots: Cypress, Glendale and Rose Hills. The gentleman name Hing Hong and his manager Julie Lin gave us a tour of the park. we were surprised at how big it was. It was beautiful, not what I expected of a cemetery at all. We ended up at a lawn where we can see the Buddhist temple. The price was surprisingly lower than my husband’s  expectations. We ended to getting an extra space for another family member. Great job Hing for being thorough in your approach and showing us all options.< /review><UserId.>111279820058993637978<//UserId.><Resp>{'time': 1577465541810, 'text': 'Cindy, it is our honor and privilege to ensure everything is prepared for in advance.

Rose Hills is the most beautiful mortuary i've ever seen. It looks more like a gigantic well maintained park overlooking the city. My Wife and I are so thankful to Mary Li who helped us every step of the way. Talking with her over the phone and showing us all the different plot locations. We were so well taken care of, we felt secure in getting our plot. Our children will be at ease knowing that we've taken care of this ahead of time. If you have any questions or concerns, ask for Mary Li! I would highly recommend doing this sooner than later.< /review>

<Review>Drove 3,000 miles to visit my grandfather's grave for the first time. Was met with insensitive security guards blocking the access road to the grounds due to COVID-19. And they couldn't care less about my long journey.

Since it wasn't safe for me to visit the living, I chose to go visit my ancestors and family members who had passed away with the ultimate goal of seeing my paternal grandfather's grave for the first time. He died when I was too little to know him.

Every other graveyard in the nation that I passed through had closed their offices and buildings for obvious reasons (to protect their workers) and in compliance with local ordinances. But none of them closed their grounds out of respect for those who wanted to visit the testing places of their family members. This put NO ONE at risk, and gave me NO REASON to think or suspect that rose hills would turn me away since I didn't encounter any other cemeteries that were closed.

And yet Rose Hills chose to post security guards at their access roads. Closing the GROUNDS is despicable. You cannot keep people from visiting their FAMILY members resting in a place the FAMILY paid for. Your governor's order only required that you close your buildings, not the entire property.

We can not infect the dead with COVID. The only thing putting those security officers at risk was the fact that they were posted there. This was an INSENSITIVE AND UNCALLED FOR move by the cemetery owners. It's one thing to close your gift shop and offices to protect workers but to close the grounds was a slap in the face to me after I finally had the time/opportunity to visit my grandfather's grave. I'm still in disbelief that I was turned away and that an exception was not made given how long I traveled and how many days I slept in my car to keep myself and others safe in order to get there. Disgusting.< /Review><userid>106464956975050607906</userid><GmapID>0x80c2d14070d1b8fb:0x5416841843ccde6c</GmapID>< Time>

<Review>The Park is the best in Southern California in all aspects. I am pleased to own seven lots for my family and so are my wife and her sisters who have six lots. Last year both of our families buried our loved ones (father and mother in law) In Rose Hills with the assistance of the Park’s representative Flora Wang. In the time of our sorrow and depression Flora warmly and carefully arranged every things for us from the beginning to the end, relieving us from the burden of having to take care the funerals and burial services. She is patient, kind, diligent, and careful. After that kind of excellent services we decided to pre-purchase the funeral and burial packages for each of us who are living so that all will be ready and prepared when the time comes for each of us.</Review><time>1570051809196< /time><username>zion lin< /username>< pictures>

<Review>Jimmy Hope as an experienced Family Support Counselor at Rose Hill Memorial Park, is definitely the right person, who we can trust. We met Jimmy when we walked in to their office on a Sunday Afternoon. He has presented us a detailed questionnaire in order to identify what kind of funeral service would be most economic and suitable based on our demands. I reckon that a professional who is able to listen to his client and dedicate his time to listen to his client, would be absolutely right person for you to trust.</Review><user_id>103960054612718492845<//user_id></record>

< Review>
This was written on behalf of my mother and our family.   This was our first time planning a memorial service and it was the worst experience.  The initial pick up was very respective, the 2 gentlemen that came to the house to pick up my father's body was very nice, compassionate and gentle.  The 2nd meeting was with Jenny Munoz, arrangement counselor.  She was very professional and went over the package my parents had previously paid for, but honestly, I wish she would have told us one hour is not enough, and having one hour in between services is a horrible idea.  We did not have any more communications with Rose Hills until the day of the service.  We were told to come 30 minutes prior to the service, and that was not enough time.   Our flowers were delivered but not in the chapel, to later find out all 3 arrangements were sitting in some other holding area, so thankfully they were found and delivered to the chapel in time for the service.   The family should have met with the funeral director and technology person prior to the service for the order and especially if it's done in a different language, as the musician did not understand when to play what song.   Then when an unexpected guest went up to speak for an additional 10 minutes, it threw our time line and as the last speaker of the service, I found it VERY disrespectful that your staff were already taking things down in the reception area making all sorts of loud noise.  Our family and guests were rushed out of the chapel so you can prepare for the next service, and as we were half way out of the chapel, I turned around and the next person's coffin was already on the stage.   This was extremely unprofessional and I would NEVER recommend your company to anyone!<//Review>

Have been dealing with Lupe Garcia and it hasn't been a good experience.  First they tried to tell us that the marker wasn't paid for it and that we have to paid for it.  When I actually went personally with my parents when they purchased it. After they double check they said that it was paid. ( So most likely if I wasn't present at the time of purchase probably they would charge us again). Today we found out that the marker was never ordered. Lupe said that we never called her back to make some changes on the marker, but the changes were sent to her email as she requested. She never bother to do a follow up call. Every time we used to ask the front desk for the marker they used to tell us that it takes about 8 weeks but they never bother to check in the system to see if it was already ordered. It hasn't been a good experience. And by the way if you guys need to talk to me Lupe has my information.</review>< Pictures>

Ms. Mary Li!!!
Has been more than a Rose Hills Rep to me and my family. I am blessed beyond words to have her as my personal contact person. She put together a package for my mom 9 years ago and during the unfortunate passing of my mom recently, I was in awe at how every detail came together for me. Being an only child I had no one to lean on, but I had Mary, my sister and friend. FOREVER grateful.< /Review>

<time>1543899536252<//time><Rate>4</Rate><Review>My grandparents are buried here and we come a few times a year to visit them. It's a huge memorial park with tons of graves. There's always a service or memorial going on, and while it's very sad, it's also a reminder of how we're all in this same cycle of life together.

I love the different areas and how each has a very distinct feel and theme. My grandparents are in the grass right when you enter. It's a beautiful, sunny plot with some big trees nearby. My uncle is cremated and in an urn in the Buddhist​ temple area on top of the hill. Going up there, you'd forget where you are. It's almost like being in Asia. There's also a children's area, which is the saddest area to go through (for me). All the staff I've encountered here have been respectful, sensitive​, and helpful. I know they helped my family out when we were dealing with the loss of my grandparents.

They keep the grounds relatively well, for how big it is. You might have to cut away overgrowth over the tombstone you're visiting, but generally the grass is all trimmed and kept short enough.< /Review>< pics>

I would like to report a fraud Rose hill sales person.

June Park Lic# FD970, Rose hill Korean sales person was dishonest to her customers.

our family was one of victim.

What I paid and signed the contract over $9000 was for double bed grave option. that was 2 years ago. that option is first casket down and then 2nd on top of it.

my father passed away and we did funeral for him on a week of 4th of July 2019. While I watched bury for his casket, I saw and found that what I purchased was one casket and one cremation.

now I knew that my aunts family worked with her before and June did the same to aunt. they are 2nd victims.

I had two deep feelings that struggled now. one is sad because I lost my father, one is anger because June Park deceived me and my family.

This is 100% true story. I read whole contract paper term and conditions and Rose hill is a private property and they protected well all legal matters for themselves. in other words, once you signed the contract even sales person deceives you, there is nothing you can do get pay back or partial pay.

Please, please beware before sign, specially June Park.

She is definitely fraud one. she was lying.

if you see my post picture, casket surrounded by natural soil. that should be by concrete all around in order to be lay double bed grave down.< /text>

In detail.  I was skeptical  at first and a bit frustrated because of the delay in getting an
Appointment with your advisors, but when they took the time and explained all that needed
To be considered I understood.  It would have been easier for my family to have had the
Service just one day earlier, but in a way it worked out just as my Aunt really wanted it.<//text>

<Review>Many of my family members have been laid to rest here over the years and working with the mortuary staff has always been as pleasant of an experience as it can be. They really take care of everything to allow you to properly mourn your loss the way you need to.The massive property is beautiful and inviting to visit. It is well maintained and continues to expand. It makes it a joyful experience when we visit our loved ones.< /Review>< Pictures>

THIS IS A REAL REVIEW FROM A RECENT CUSTOMER!!!!

Unfortunately, our family has had a terrible experience here. We paid for the entire funeral and service 2 years ahead of our family members passing and you’d think we’d get tip top service. But it was the complete opposite. To begin, we didn’t get an appointment until about 4 days and got the bottom of the barrel in dates and times for the service. So if your planning on burying a loved one here don’t do it in advance!

Secondly, our arrangement counselor Juan Cuevas was all over the place in our first meeting. He was talking to us as if we’ve been there before and buried many loved ones. We had a pointless 3 hour meeting and at the end told us he wasn’t sure if it could happen because proper paperwork isn’t in place(which ideally he should’ve started with).  We had a million questions towards the end because he didn’t explain anything.

On top of that, we sent all 50 pictures on time to get printed in the memory book. The night before we receive and email confirming they only received 2 pictures. We immediately call and no answer. We respond to email and once again no answer.

No food or outside drink was allowed for guests during memorial services.

Hired an organist (through rose hills) to play during the service and he called me asking if I had a playlist so he can play (on the speaker through a phone) during the service. I told him we hired him to play (on the piano) music for the service, and he agreed.

Overall, it was a terrible experience. Very beautiful place but we highly regret coming here. If I can give a review of less than 1 I would.<//Review>

My father passed away 2 weeks ago due to heart failure. We were told by Rose Hills that we would only be allowed a gravesite service with only 10 people for 15 minutes. My father is and was a wonderful man who devoted his entire life to his family and helping others. I know he wants his kids, grandkids and relatives to attend his services. We cannot tell his grandchildren and siblings that they cannot attend his funeral.
I read the Los Angeles order and it states no more than 10 people in a confined space. An outdoor gravesite service is not a confined space. Rose Hills is very insensitive to implement a 15 minute time limit on services. Not code its a Rose Hills rule.
My father is waiting at Rose Hills to be buried.
We were told that if we want more than 10 people to attend his funeral we will have to wait until covid is over. I asked them if I could schedule a tentative date for his services in June or July. They said no, unless it is 10 people. I am asking Rose Hills to allow us to bury our father soon. The minimal amount of direct family is 20 people with a gravesite service. This is breaking my family's hearts.</text>

Just simply amazingly great, friendly, compassionate customer service from Veronica Fierro. After helping us do all funeral arrangements when my mom passed she’s helped us get our plots for the whole family and was so patient and willing to explain everything to us as many times as necessary never did she lose her patience or awesome attitude. This time around she’s  helping all my family with the planning of services,and all the other necessary stuff no matter what time we call her she’s always there to answer our questions and not only answer but she makes sure we understand everything being explained. She’s worked very late hours just to help us has come to where we are and most importantly she does it all with dedication and most importantly she helps us from the bottom of her heart and not only to make a commission on the sale. If I ever need any other service I’d definitely come back to her and I absolutely highly recommend anyone looking to start their funeral arrangements to make sure you ask for Veronica Fierro to help you. I promise you she’s the best and she will treat you as she’d expect  her or her family to be treated.<//review>

Let me first start off by saying, that rose hills has gone down in there quality of service in there arraignments dept. Lack of training knowledge and the overall ability to care for there customers need to improve. Brittney and Todd however new, they are still learning. But common sense is lacking, when u make an I.D. on a deceased love one and they do not note it down..we have a problem..or u tell them to embalm your loved one and they fail to do this too..we have a problem. Rose hills is a business and there in business to make a profit and they will offer there condolences while at the same time trying to get u to purchase one of there burial packages that requires u to take out a small loan or start a go fund me page because it costs more money for u to die than to live..Rose Hills at one time was really great, but today I wont go back to them. Really disappointed but u can make the call.</text>

It took me by complete surprise!  The overall experience at Rose Hills was good, except for a small hiccup that was eventually fixed.  Our advisor Cecilia Chan worked with her supervisor Julie Lynn and resolved the issue for our family.  It was not easy, at least management recognized their own mistakes and took steps to remediate it.  Eventually, we did return to purchase our own funeral services.  Cecilia Chan and her supervisor Julie worked well together and took care of us, even though our schedules were not flexible.

In all honesty, I feel like they go above and beyond their services to comfort families.  From time to time, the grass around the headstone may cover the edges, and sometimes the flower vase is hard to remove. At these moments I feel ashamed of myself that it has taken me so long to visit my dad and to care for his grave. It brings me comfort to have one go to person to take care of all my needs. I can turn to Cecilia to have these issues fixed.

I highly recommend Rose Hills & the compassionate employees.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

A family member introduced me to Amy Tsai, a Rose Hills representative. Amy was there from start to finish...and has become family to me. She showed me properties to choose from, scheduled visitation & service arrangements, the burial and explained all the financials. Not necessary on her part, but Amy  was present for every scheduled event. She wanted to make sure everything went smoothly and with her help, everything did. THANK YOU Amy!...and thank you to everyone at Rose Hills for the wonderful service.

After things settled a bit, I contacted Amy for properties for my parents, who are alive and well...thank you Lord! It’s never too early to prepare for the inevitable death Rose Hills can help. I would recommend Amy Tsai to anyone. 🙏< /Text><rate>5</rate>< user_id>

Would love to give credits to Veronica Fierro for all her hard work. She has an excellent empathetic,compassionate, extraordinary customer service etiquette, she treated us like family not only did she stay late at work to help us during our difficult time when we were trying to find a plot for my mother,but she’s also helped the family in finding a plot close to our mother’s plot. She went above and beyond to accommodate each and everyone of the family members needs and tried her best to make sure we all got the best deals possible and most important next to where our mother and uncle now rest.She is an amazing human being and employee that deserves to be recognized for her hard work. We are extremely pleased and appreciate all the help she’s given us, she always made herself available to answer any questions we’ve had or that come up as we plan all our future burials. She has made this a bit easier on us, by accommodating all our needs and having the compassion and empathy for us through this extremely difficult time. Veronica Fierro truly deserves an employee of the month award. I highly recommended you guys go to her for all your planning needs.< /Text>

My advisor, Amy Tsai, was very helpful, respectful, and knowledgeable when explaining to me in great detail of all the services that Rose Hills provide which helped my decision making process when making a purchase like this. She went out of her way to show me all the plots available that was within my desired price range and was very patient while waiting for me to decide.</review>

Rose Hills is indeed a beautiful cemetery I have several family members who are there. My Father In Law recently passed away and we are trying to lay him to rest with my Mother In Law. They are making this difficult. Rose Hills is trying to add on an almost additional $800 fee for a Funeral Director to be present for a direct burial of cremains. All we want to do is say our final goodbyes for a few minutes and watch them put him with his wife and they are persistent on this cost. The counselors name is Lupe, she even said we can get a Funeral Director of our own if we didn’t want to use theirs.  SHAME ON YOU!! Taking advantage of a grieving family. I even spoke with the mortuary we had made the arrangements with and they said they have never heard of such a thing. Be careful, look and listen because they will take advantage of your wallet.</text>

It is of the utmost importance to us to meet the needs of those we serve, and it's saddening that your impression of us didn't align with this. However, most mortuaries and cemeteries do have fees for scheduling and directing graveside services and witness interments, regardless of how many people are planning to attend. If you would like to speak directly about this, please send your phone number to RHCustomerCare@rosehills.com and I will be sure to follow up with you.

Today I had a really nice experience with a Rose Hills sales representative, Adele Soriano. She was thoughtful, and clearly explained my pre-arrangement needs. I truly appreciated her calm and patient demeanor, as she carefully listened to my family’s needs. She took the time to take me to different properties and show me my options. I am thankful for her help at this difficult time.<//Review>

<review>My wife and I finalized the purchase of our property on September 12, 2019. Prior to the purchase we met with Mary Li, who asked what our needs were and concerns about pre-planning for the future. Mary explained the pros and cons of pre-planning versus at-need services.  After the tour of the facility, a possible location was selected, we decided to think about this property before pulling the trigger. Mary was very professional, answered all of are questions to our satisfaction, and there was no high pressure sales to complete the purchase on the initial visit. My wife and I were completely satisfied with Mary’s professionalism and the attention to our needs. Excellent customer service.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2d14070d1b8fb:0x5416841843ccde6c< /gmapID>< user>

<review>We have purchased two cemetery plots with their Pre-planning counselor, named Jimmy Hope. Mr. Jimmy has demonstrated a profound knowledge about the Pre-planning, and also he has input a data analysis for us to review how we can save money if we would purchase the cemetery plots earlier. We ended up purchasing two plots with ZERO Interest rate. I would recommend you to look for Mr. Jimmy if you would plan to purchase any cemetery plots or funeral packages.< /review><user_id>107740805181378131842<//user_id>< GmapID>

< review>
We recently needed funeral services and Rose Hills staff were very helpful with not only the basics but also very patient with all of our questions. Rose Hills was even kind enough to fix a misunderstanding from 5 years ago, even though it resulted in some financial loss. Julie Lin was especially helpful and provided constant updates while the issues were getting resolved. Cant say I want to return again soon, but they have definitely earned our trust through this experience.< /review>

I bought 2 plots in Rosehills for my wife and me many years ago and have been keeping on approached by the agents for services pre-planning until I met David Lau in the booth at the Square Market.

Thank you David for his professional advice and recommendation on pre-planning. He explained the plan to me and my wife in detail and listened to our needs patiently. We were happy with the plan and signed the contract with him on next day. Thank you David again for solving our long-termed problem in such a short period of time.< /Text>

The cemetery and mortuary is operated by the City of Whittier. I have had many visits over the years when family members, friends and their relatives passed away. They have always provided professional service and the Park is kept in good conditions. Be careful when bringing small children to visit. A few years ago a nearby brush fire caused by an automobile accident, has disturbed wildlife habitats nearby. There are packs of coyotes roaming about the park sometimes.< /Review>

I am a true believer that God doesn't make mistakes and he will send earthly angels  to help guide and support you during difficult times.  I know factually that God sent Diane Brooks on my path, although I did not realize when we met what capacity God would use her, but in the matter of months I would need her more than I could have ever imagined. When I initially met Diane, she educated me on the importance pre-planning, at that time I did not want to discuss the possibility or plan anyone in my family's funeral, purchase plots are anything of that nature. However, I am so grateful that she was passionate about educating me passed my discomfort of the topic as I needed her sooner than I thought. My close relative received an unexpected diagnosis that ended her life quicker than our family expected. Diane Brooks supported me through the process from start to finish. She traveled to me during those days where I just did not have the strength or energy to make it out the Rosehills with no hesitation, I called her day and night with questions and she was always willing to help. Diane was first person I called when my relative passed at 4a.m. and she not only handled the business part of the process, she supported me through the emotional areas as well. Diane Brooks will be embedded in the hearts of our family as we will never forget all of her support. I  am so thankful to Diane Brooks and all of the Rosehills staff who supported our family during this time.

Thank you Diane Brooks</Review>

Rose Hills has been very accommodating to all of our needs for funeral and burial services. Our representative Joshua Liu was very helpful and provided exceptional customer service. It was a pleasure working with Joshua in helping planning my mother in law & father in laws funeral. This was a very hard time for me and my family and they showed love and compassion since day one. The prices are very reasonable and they go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure your happy and your arrangements are fulfilled. They also offer payment plans and make the process as simple as possible. My wife and I also started pre-planning and have also purchased plots. I would highly recommend Rose Hills funeral home for your loved ones memorial or funeral service. And ask for Joshua Liu if you want to get taken care of. Joshua walked us through every step of the way and we really appreciate the hard work and dedication he took in helping us get through this.  Thank you Joshua & Rose Hills for giving my family peace.< /Review>

I met with Teddy Repp, and he gave me all my information I needed. We had such a wonderful conversation, and really made me feel comfortable to know that Rose Hills is a home for my shell to be put to rest while I take my journey home. Mr.Repp Thank You!!!</text>

This place has a very large pasture and space for family and friends to remember the passing ones. However, you will lose your cellphone signal up the hills, so you better remember how to drive to the exit as you come inside. Plus, the roads here are not well labeled or distinguished from each other, so you have to depend on yourself or the ones that came out with you for directions.<//review>

1 month ago:  The most incompetent staff I have ever worked with. From the first encounter with arranger Joel Roman, "any questions or concerns,call me anytime, I am here for you." What a LIE!! He is just a Rose Hills salesman. He never did take any calls from me, though 4 other "arrangers" I spoke with were not very helpful at all. But, they will call you  early in the morning on payment due date! There seems to be such a disconnection of communication among the staff. If you want specifics, I kept notes and can name quite a few incidents that happened.  Even today...the death certificate, which was scheduled to be mailed, is at their office waiting to be picked up by me, though I live out of state. Such incompetence!  My opinion, The ONLY thing they have going for them is the beautiful  grounds.< /Text>

The generations of my family that are resting at Rose Hills are vast. I remember as a child coming to the park with my grandmother. I didn’t really know what we were there for. I just knew it was for and with family. A few months back, it was my turn to get my affairs in order.  Ms Norma Escoto was my advisor. She took loving care of every question that I had. She was honest,real,and thoughtful. Her professional approach to this awkward process was amazing! She made me feel like family! This kind of service is exactly why multiple generations of my family are resting at Rose Hills! Thank you Ms Escoto, for EVERYTHING!!!   P. W. Gerardi Long Beach, CA</review>

I recently purchased property at rose hills as pre need for my wife and I. I had the pleasure of working with Adelle Soriano. If you are looking for someone who is compassionate and patient just ask for her. It took me numerous days to make a decision and each day I spen multiple hours going through the entire cemetery sometimes twice and Adelle never rushed me or made me feel uncomfortable for being so indecisive. She is the only employee at rose hills that I will deal with no disrespect to the rest. Adelle is extremely knowledgeable about all pre need information as well as funeral pre need. Thank you so much Adelle the mitchell family loves and trusts you fully.</Review>

My name is Mario Torres, and I lost my mom this year on August 7, 2019. Planning for my mom's burial never crossed mine nor my sisters mind but following procedure we were first guided to the Chapel of Memories who than referred us to Veronica Fierro of Rose Hills. Veronica was very respectful and understanding of our grieving while she walked through each step to provide my mom with a beautiful service. I am sure all the counselor's/advisors there at Rose Hills are trained to comfort mourning patrons, but Veronica Fierro was the clounselor/advisor there for me and my sister during our time of need.
Thank you,
Veronica Fierro<//Text>

Beautiful landscaping and easy to get to. Have 2 loved ones buried here. The viewing room and seating was clean,  plenty of room for guests,  nice koi pond with soothing waterfall outside for those who need a some fresh air during services.  Aside from a few sales reps that could benefit from a training class on etiquette in working with grieving family the selection of services were acceptable. During the funeral they had a long wait to get more dirt to fill the hole to bury the cremated remains which was awkward yet the gentleman overseeing the process was professional, sympathetic and polite.<//review>

<Review>Where do I begin? I was referred to Diane Brooks by a friend and I have to say she was truly a gift from God! Initially we were introduced to discuss the option of preplanning and like most I was hesitant and reluctant to think about or talk about death. However, I am very happy and lucky that I decided to go through with preplanning memorial services and purchasing a burial plot.

When I met Diane she took her time to answer every question that I had even the ones I may have asked several times. She was patient compassionate and truly has a great love for what she does. She throughly walked me through the process from beginning to end! Shortly after purchasing, my mother passed away and I realized how great of a decision I had made. Everything went just ask Diane said it would and she was kind enough to follow up with us through every step of the process to ensure that things went smoothly.

As uncomfortable as it may seem or sound  I recommend everyone consider preplanning. Not only does it take a load off your entire family, it will also allow you to make decisions and choose all memorial or burials options upfront. I was an emotional wreck after losing my mother and having everything already picked out before her passing allowed me to grieve her as peacefully as possible, given the circumstances, without having to make tough decision at the time of her death. Truly the best decision I could have ever made!

I am a firm believer in God and I can't thank him enough for bringing Ms. Diane into my life at such a critical time. I pray that he blesses her for being such a blessing to my entire family. Not only was she amazing, but so were each of her colleagues at Rose Hills who made an unpleasant situation such as death, as pleasant as possible with their caring and compassionate demeanor.

Thank you to everyone that I encountered at Rose Hills!

<text>My love one’s funeral was on April 2019 elsewhere. After attending several grief share groups to cope with this great loss, I thought I was done with the funeral arrangements. As the ashes of the love of my life need to Rest In Peace in God’s garden, Veronica Paz from Rose Hills helped me and guided me to acquire the property and make the arrangements of the burial of her ashes at an affordable price. The care of Veronica Paz and her professional service helped me not to feel the same pain I experience back in April while I was making all arrangements for the funeral of the love of my life. Verona Paz is the best at Rose Hills.

We have everything preplaned with Rose Hills.
But Adele Soriano offered us the travel protection plan.
This was exactly what we needed since we are retired and enjoyed traveling.
This is an added peace of mind that we really appreciate.
We definitely would recommend other people to contact her.
She is knowledgeable , patient, accommodating and carring.

<text>10 Stars for the Wonderful staff person in the truck who helped us find the grave we were looking for. We had never been there before. We were only asking him where we had to go to get a map or some information.
We showed him what we had...All he said was "follow me".  We followed him in his truck and then followed him more as he trudged up the hill to the exact grave we were looking for. It would be so nice if everyone was as helpful as he is.

3 Stars for having to wait over 10 minutes in the Flower Shop to make a simple purchase on a $10 bunch of flowers.
3 Stars on how long it must have been since they have trimmed the Headstones.<//text><username>R L<//username></record>

This is the first time that I have felt the need to write a review on something.
My mom passed suddenly on Jan 1.
It was devastating.
David Young, Family Service Counselor at Rose Hills was and is a godsend.
At this extremely trying time, I believe David went way above and beyond the call of duty.
Due to his caring and understanding of my situation, he was able to make an unbearable day a little more livable.
I thank you David and the staff at Rose Hills.<//Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Pics>None</Pics><text>I went to visit both my parents gravesites today 11/24/18. They are both buried side by side. It was the worst experience since both their deaths. I was in disbelief at what I saw. Such an eye sore. I have so many family members buried here & to think how both my parents worked so hard because they both were determined to be buried here. The maintenance is absolutely terrible! & I will not be recommending Rose Hills to anyone anymore. I went home depressed & disappointed.

Had difficulty finding my parents gravesites. Not well marked at all. Came from out of state.
Went to my nephews  service Asked to have air conditioning turned up. it was warm. was told no.
Everything had a hidden cost and a lot of misquotes on price.  Get everything in writing initially. Thankfully my niece did because they wanted more money later.
Will hopefully never have to do business with Rose Hills ever again< /Text>

My mother-in-law recently passed away, and my family had already made arrangements to have her cremated with another funeral home. Unfortunately the funeral home we chose did not have options for the urn for her remains, so we decided to call Rose Hills to inquire about purchasing an urn.

BIG MISTAKE.

I was very clear over the phone that I was not looking to make any arrangements; I only wanted to browse and purchase an urn. The man I spoke to was named Robert Fox, and initially he seemed very friendly and helpful and told me to come in right away and he would be able to help me out in purchasing an urn

My husband, his brother, and I went immediately and as we arrived, Robert greeted us and lead us to the showroom where the urns were on display. As soon as we entered the room, he turns to us and tells us that we might be better off purchasing an urn on Amazon or Costco because it would be cheaper. Respectfully, we explained that we had already done some browsing, but wanted to see some urns in person, and that if we saw one we liked we would purchase it, regardless of the price.

We did end up finding an urn we really liked, but wanted to look at one other place my husband had seen, and politely told Robert that we would discuss as a family and most likely return the next day to purchase. Once again, Robert suggested we look online because of the price, which we did end up doing, but we couldnt find one similar enough to the one we saw at Rose Hills.

The next day my husband, his aunt, and I returned to Rose Hills ready to purchase the urn. We asked for Robert and told him our intention. He said he would get the paperwork started and disappeared for some time. When he returned, he informed us that they were out of stock and that they would have to order it for us, and that it wouldn't be in until the following Thursday or Friday.

We were okay with this timeframe, and asked if we could pay in advance or put down a security deposit to ensure the urn would be ours. Robert said no, that we should pay when the urn arrives in stock. He took down my number and said he would call us as soon as it arrived in stock. We never received a call back, and it is already past the timeframe he gave us.

At the end of the day, it was obvious that they did not want to sell to us because we did not have my mother-in-law's services with them.

I normally wouldn't mind this, but what bothers me is that instead of telling us this was a policy, they led us on and wasted our time and energy. We are already grieving the loss of someone extremely important, and the lack of professionalism and outright deception from Rose Hills is disgusting.

I do not recommend this place in any sense of the word and would caution anyone to trust them with handling their loved ones final arrangements.< /text>

Today I met my dad! Unfortunately it is 10 years too late.
I love this Memorial park because it has beautiful green grass and the grounds are kept up. If you need help finding a grave site, the people at the office are most helpful. Also, if you're at a site and it's overgrown or you cannot locate or open a flower hold, just let them know and a maintenance person shows up right away to fix any issues. Over all, a very nice place.</review>

2 months ago my family and I had to bury my grandmother. The woman that we saw to make arrangements with was such a rude and nasty person. Her name is Heidi Gonzales. My mother didn't  understand the nearly 1600 dollar charge for overhead and so she asked Heidi to plz explain. She answered my mother as if she had a learning disability or if my mother was a little girl. If you have no choice to go here avoid this horribly woman. I never would of expected to be treated this way at such a tragic time in mine and my family's life.</review>

Losing a loved one is no laughing matter, but Rose Hills made me wish I was the one who died instead of my dear aunt.  I live 400 miles away and had great difficulty in dealing with Rose Hills.  I was only trying to bury my aunt's ashes on top of her husband who had died 30 years earlier.  Besides all the paperwork, legal forms, etc., they insisted on full payment at least a week before the burial.  Since I was from out of town, they wanted a cashier's check too.  I paid and the burial actually went well.  However, it then took them more than 12 weeks to fabricate the new headstone with my aunt's name on it.  Therefore, after insisting on full payment, they didn't deliver all they promised until 13 weeks after payment.  They have beautiful grounds, but the management in in the internment office stinks.  A very poorly run organization with no compassion for those who have lost a loved one.</Review>

Yes, the place is beautiful but finding restrooms was difficult today. The one at Sky Rose chapel was out of order, the next nearest one had a code key lock. We had to shorten our visit due to this complication. This should not be an issue with such a busy place.< /review>

WARNING! ACHTUNG!  Run, don't walk out of this place.   A Rose Hill (RH)Agent quoted almost 50% higher than Renaker, an independently owned Funeral Home in Buena Park.  Obviously I went with Renaker.

I felt I was being played for a fool.  So I called Customer Service @ RH and explained the situation.  1.5 hours later some other salesman was trying to explain how they are the Cadillac of the Funeral Home business; hence the 50% premium increase.  If you want the Cadillac of a cremation service, make sure to call them. They will definitely siphon all your hard earned cash.

So the lesson here is; don't believe the BS.  Be smart and obtain multiple quotes.  My next steps are the BBB & filing a complaint with U.S. AG Xavier Becerra.<//review>

My father passed away and Ester was coordinating the service. She initially called saying she would take care of everything then I didn’t hear a peep from her for over 4 weeks. After calling to try to get some answers, the operator laughed for keeping me on hold for over 20 minutes! Terrible company. Stay away!< /Text>

< Review>
They moved my daughter's head stone down 24 inches from where it was when I burried her without any notification as to why. Exposed my daughter's coffin vault when tjey dug the burial place for the person above her. Explanation to me. "I don't know why they burried the person so close or dug the dirt that close to her grave site" That's it. Anyone kbow who I can repirt this to. Taking property after its sold is a crime, isn't it? I do believe so.  While preparing fir the service I selected a memory card with Asian scripture. I was told by my supposed rep. Oh no, you don't want that one, ONLY ASIAN people like that one. Well I be darn, she just excluded that I am 1/2 Japanese. It was the worst experience and I wish it on no one else. So that's why the one. Oh, did I mention they remived the head stone without my notification and when I asked what happened to it, Yes, they had to send someone to the spit to verify eventhough I had pictures. Then told me there isn't a work order and they'll have to get back with me". I understand why now. They needed to cirrect their error of placement, i.e the 24 inches downward move. This place is horrible😞😢. Made someone I know keep their parent above ground because they messed up their paperwork. Had nerves to place on the casket, family redused for burial! Almost 2hrs in the hot sun did their mother sit, in the casket, until someone fron their administarion could resolve that issue. You know what happened to the corspe! Just imagine. They don't keep corspe in the freezer for nothing.<//Review>

My dad is buried at rosehills. Everything was paid for. There staff is so horrible. There rude inconsiderate and ever since they have new owners it's all about the $ $ $.  I know you need a cemetery when you die.
Really think twice about
rosehills. There staff messes up everything paperwork burial site ashes. Please go elsewhere for a cemetery.  It might look beautiful but believe me they chopped down the rose garden they had. If you choose this place Rosehills be prepared to be misplaced ripped off and treated like a Idiot for catching them when there staff is wrong. They will turn the tables on you. My dad is there and when it's time my mom will  be there.  But I won't Hell no. I'm going elsewhere.<//Text>

I just wanted to highlight the friendly service I recently received by one of your employees.  As I was struggling to clean my husband's gravesite, I was approached by one of your employees named Oscar.  He offered to help me clean it and cut the grass around the headstone.  I asked him if I needed to pay him and of course he said no.  He not only edged the headstone, but also edged the flower vase too.  He took good care of my flowers and made sure I was far way so as to not get hurt from the flying debri.  It was such a plesure to see someone who enjoys their job.  Thank you!</Text></record>

<review>(Translated by Google) 2021;may. Dear mom. Even today, nostalgic, Rose Hills Motuary. I go to the place where my mother's body was buried to give flowers to her longing and nostalgic report. Breaking up in the world like this and breaking up with me. In sadness and longing. Tears keep flowing because I came to the ugly child. Cleaning the tombstone. our mom. I miss you, I'm in tears. I tried to put it away because it was useless in my home garden, but lemon blossoms bloomed after 7 years. Jujube persimmons and tomatoes that slowly bloom in the garden, all of which became memories with my mother. My beloved mother. I. I didn't know why. Mom is. It's a great gift from God to me. still. In such a close place. To this calm and beautiful Rose Hill. I am happy to be able to come often.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Although I didn't know much about my mom, she chose this place as a place for her elderly to sleep instead of burying her father, but it is understandable that she chose it because of the beautiful environment here.
