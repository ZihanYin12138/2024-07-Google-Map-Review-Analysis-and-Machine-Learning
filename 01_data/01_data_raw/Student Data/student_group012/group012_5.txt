One stop shopping. They have everything you need! Usually not too crowded so it's pleasant to browse through here. Clean, well stocked aisles. Good location too. Not the cheapest place but it's worth spending a little more for an easier shopping experience.</text>

<review>I called ahead if it was fine to bring my Segway scooter and they were very understanding. I entered the Staples store and i left my Segway scooter out of the way and i was assisted by a sweet associate that helped me scan my documents. I highly recommend this Staples location for all your business and household needs 😊<//review>< date>

<Date>1557865338431< /Date><rating>3< /rating><review>I bought something ( a quotable pouch) and it was heavily discounted from $6.99 to $1.00! I asked if all of these pouches were the same price and the cashier said yes as they had been there for sometime. I told her I'd go grab more as it was only a dollar each. She said yes, go get some more at that great price. Turns out they were over $5 each! I went to her and told her that I only went back to that area as she told they were ALL a $1 which wasn't true. They could have offered me a discount due to their misinformation but did not! Luckily I had a coupon and used it..not as low as $1 but something..
As a (long time) customer, I expect excellent service...<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29a96afadcb77:0x24634eb1159ef365</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Store employee, Jennifer, working the Print and Copy area gained a Staples customer from Office Depot and I will recommend to everyone. When I initially was standing in line she was helping one employee and had the ability to multitask by taking initiative to ask me what I needed while the person she was checking out was gathering their money to pay. After she finished with that customer she continued to help me get my poster print ordered throughly and explaining everything I would need to know. She showed me a sample of how the poster would look since Staples equipment needed to be laminated, she showed me how my photo would look on a larger scale, she advised me my photo would look better on a size a few inches smaller than what Office Depot was going to do and she advised it would be completed one hour later. I did not mention to her I needed my poster same day she took it upon herself to get the job done fast and without error. She was very friendly and professional a model employee to have as a representative for Staples.< /review>

Nice store but it's sad how the prices are a little high. I've seen the same products in another store but it's cheaper. I wish Staples offers better pricing and I will shop there more.</Review>

<Review>Came to ship boxes at UPS and was told I couldn't  because they don't have account services. I asked for help taking my heavy boxes back to my car and was told someone would help me and never came. I had to take my boxes back to my car myself after being tested service. I always have bad experiences at this stapes, and this has been the worst STAPLES experience I've ever had. Will not coming back, can't recommend anyone to come here.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Severely understaffed store, and it's always a mess too (morning, noon, evening).  I asked about the price of a chair to one of the cashiers and they sent for someone to assist me over the speakers  but no one ever came.  I used my phone to look up the prices instead, and the cashier brought me the chair.  Nice staff, but just sad how understaffed this place is.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Well-stocked for school supplies! Some things can be a little pricey, but everything's in one place. Make sure to go at the beginning of August when you can get 20% off your entire purchase of school supplies when you buy a backpack. We saved a ton!< /Text>

They are liars with their advertising...they offer 110%matching prices but, when you ask for it they always say "Not Today" ...they should not advertise what they are not willing to do...<//Review>

Sadly, the Office Depot at Granada Hills closed☹️. Honestly, I would rather go out of my way to get my office supplies because I dislike Staples return policy. 🤪👎👎👎</Text>

Awful, I went in there to return a UPS item back to Costco (Printer) I had the return label on my USB, and an email, however, they wanted $.12 to print the label no big deal it's  the principal, I've done this once before & never got charged, I  Won't return to Staples Granada Hills ever again.< /Text>

<review>I had to give these 5 stars to the waitress/receptionist/ problem solver Jocelyn jossie not sure if I spelled that correctly or not but she went above and beyond to rectify a door dash screw up. The food was good but her customer service was profound.</review>< Gmap_id>

We ordered the flaming hot roll, shrimp enchiladas (Verde), and the Torre 701. Everything was bland except for the Chile verde sauce for the enchiladas. My husband said the shrimp in the enchiladas tasted like soap. It looked like the seafood in the Torre 701 was wasn't marinaded in the juice at all and they had cooked shrimp. I ended up getting food poisoning from it. The rice in the flaming hot roll tasted old and the roll in general tasted bland. The hot Cheetos included with it we're soooo stale they weren't even crunchy anymore just hard. Never ordering from this place again!</Text>

<Review>Walked in alone, sat @ counter looking in kitchen. Very clean and well organized! Asked the manager about some items and he was kind to sample me on numerous items@ no charge to me ! Very impressed. Will definitely go more often. Menu very well priced for the quality and quantity!<//Review><userid>102955412536185140411< /userid>< Date>

First time customer, the place is located in the corner of the shopping center. Once you walk-in, it's a quaint restaurant with a bit of charm. We were immediately attended and the server took our order. Good atmosphere and lots of TVs for sport fanatics. The food menu is not too busy and the beer selections are standard for what they serve. I had the Molcajete De Callo De Hacha and my lady enjoyed her Torre 701. The food was delicious and the server very attentive. No complaints for my first visit and truly enjoyed the food, beer, and atmosphere. I would definitely come back to try something else from the menu.< /text>

Like the food i order the campena 701 and a coctel de camaron  all tasty with flavor.  Was a little nervous in trying out this place but definitely recommend it to all friends and family. Banda was good just need a little more tunning.<//review>

<Review>Good food but the bands that play there.... They're just so loud that you can't even talk to anyone and they speak weird and sounds like just someone talking thats not music if you don't get good bands at least don't bother making us customers have to listen and not having a chance to talk or even understand anything.. but the food is amazing i love it 😄<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I decided to give this place another try  and the lady with the fake Chanel shirt and the fake Chanel earrings was very rude! I asked her to heat up my food so that it wouldn't be cold.  She told me that it wasn't her problem and chuckled her way back to the kitchen!  The waitresses hardly speak English! When I walked into the restaurant she walked right past me and to 2 other customers and seated them first. They got chips, salsa and water and it took them 10 minutes to address me</text>< Pics>

The restaurant is NICE and CLEAN food is AMAZING but service is bad in the fact that they don't try to talk to you in English (I speak spanish) but my coworker does not and the waitress was getting frustrated with the fact that he kept answering her in English... Just a whole lot of attitude not very professional...</review>

Mexican fusion SHUSHI! OH MY GOD! SOO GOOD! Some amazingly weird combinations but superdelish! Try El Patrón o El Chapito! There is one with Carne Asada "el norteño" soo unexpected and fun!< /review>

<time>1506706267090< /time><Review>Nice menu. Not overwhelming. Very cool staff. The food was awesome!!!! Keep doing what your doing.  Thank you for a nice experience.

So the first time I went it was awesome... Second time I go... Jeeez the waiters was trying to decorate and serve us when she was able too. Took awhile before we got our plates. You know something is wrong when the pepinos are hot. ... I guess it's a hit an miss.... When it comes to restaurants... Main dish was awesome still. Service was sucky this time... Hmmm not sure on a 3rd time... If I do it will have to be on a super calm day so I won't trip on the service.< /Review></record>

Food was okay, service was HORRIBLE. It seemed like the waitress wanted nothing to do with us, we had to keep asking other waitresses to call ours, the hostess kept giving me horrible looks. Fix your face, girl!<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I ordered ceviche and couldn't find the one. Shrimp. It is more vegetables than anything, we know that life is expensive but do not abuse, I ordered shrimp ceviche toast, not tomato and onion.

(Original)
Ordene ceviche y no encontré el. Camaron. Es más verdura que nada, sabemos que la vida está cara pero no abusen pedí tostadas de ceviche de camarón, no de jitomate y cebolla.<//Review>< user>

<review>(Translated by Google) The food is delicious, the place is quite beautiful, very cool. What if it leaves a little to be desired is the service of the waitresses, the times we have been they serve one as if they were annoyed and moody. I'm a waitress, I know how to give a good service, maybe that's why I pay more attention to this little detail. From then on as I mentioned, their seafood is very tasty and the tortillas are freshly made. I only recommend putting waitresses who really want their work😉

(Original)
La comida esta delisciosa, el lugar bastante lindo, muy padre. Lo que si deja un poco que desear es el servicio de las meseras, las veces que hemos ido lo atienden a uno como si estubieran fastidiadas y malhumoradas. Yo soy mesera, se como se debe dar un buen servicio, tal vez poreso me fijo mas en este pequeño detalle. De ahi en mas como mensione, sus mariscos estan sabrosisimos y las tortillas recien hechas ni se diga😋. Solo les recomiendo poner meseras que realmente quieran su trabajo😉</review>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Very relaxing atmosphere,  helpful employees,  tons of cotton fabric to choose from and it's good quality.   I bought several 24" zippers (that I'll cut and make more zippers with) for $2.99, I think it was.  The location felt safe and clean which some of the other fabric places didn't.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Such a helpful happy place.  Excellent selection of fabric, rulers and notions. I wasn't looking for patterns or thread but it looked like a good selection of both. Very nice staff.  I'll definitely be back!</text>

Poor customer service. I walked around the store looked at every fabric in search for something for my new grandsons nursery. I seen several staff but no one greeted me or asked if I needed help. In fact, no one even smiled or pretended to be happy to see me in there store. I was dressed decent with make up and   Hair. ?? I will never go there again nor would I recommend to anyone.<//Review>

Favorite quilting store in the Sacramento area.  Modern, open, airy feel inside and no snootiness!  Really classy and modern fabrics, as well as batiks and the darker color plaid-like antique-y looking stuff.  Awesome shop with nice ladies working there.</Review>

I love this little fabric store..It has a nice variety of prints and color fabric.. And since Beverly is closing this is a wornderiful place to get your quilting fabric and the staff is friendly and helpful also that have a very nice class room that have beautiful displays of quilting projects to get you inspired . All I can say if you are crying because Beverly's is closing the store on Madison Ave. Do yourself a favor and check out Fabric Gardens you be happy you did.</Review>

{'time': 1473195794084, 'text': 'Alecia, I am very sorry that you did not enjoy your visit to our store.  I did not speak with you personally, but was here when you brought a bus of ppl with disabilities into the shop.  I admire you for helping these individuals to get out of their houses and care homes and into different environments for enrichment. You said you were a seamstress and my "lady" let you know that we are not a typical  fabric store that carries a wide variety of fabric types.  We specialize in quilting, small sewing projects and hand embroidery.  We carry 100% cotton fabrics and books, patterns and notions for quilting and hand embroidery.  I am sorry that you may have misinterpreted her meaning.  Again, I apologize.'}<//Response>

Love it! Very central location and you can’t hear highway 29.  Great views of the vineyard and quiet location.  Definitely will stay here again with friends since is in the middle of so many wineries!  Freemark Abby has a path to the hotel so make that your first or last winery!!!<//text>

<Review>The short comings in service and amenities were blamed on the virus.  Sorry....not good enough.  Breakfast was delivered in boxes to one’s room.  They refused to set up the outdoor tables.  No excuse for that.  Coffee was insipid.  Posted notice that rooms would be made up only once every three days.  With a room rate of over $400 that is not acceptable.  In short the virus furnished an excuse to make service much more awful than it needed to be.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80845af52a16f105:0x23ed098bfa86aabe< /Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

Lovely restored property, cozy bedroom with new bathrooms. My only observation and that doesn't apply every time is that there's little or no insolation between floors. We could clearly feel the kids above us running around and that made our stay fairly annoying.< /text>

The worst hotel I have ever been to in my life. Customer service is trash. They don’t like to communicate in person only through email during my stay. Stains on the robes. Not dog friendly. There was no clear information on what their dog policy was.I was emailed after my stay that I would be charged an extra $200 because I was accused of stealing a duvet cover. Then when speaking to a manager they said it was a cleaning fee not for stealing a duvet cover. I believe the front desk Nichole needs to do some customer service training because she does not know how to communicate with guests in person. She only writes emails. As you can tell I will not be coming back. Watch out for hidden fees they usually charge and tell you after you check out.<//text>

<date>1607040000000<//date><rating>None< /rating><Review>Beautiful and relaxing stay here during times of COVID. There weren't many staying at this property so it almost felt like we had the place to ourselves. The location is close to many sites but tucked away for a quiet stay. We really enjoyed our time. The room was clean but I wiped and sprayed everything down anyway to be safe. Breakfast is included and delivered to your door. The view from Room 17 was beautiful. My only minor complaint would be that the sinks in our room are so low it's challenging to wash your hands because there's little space. With COVID we washed our hands a lot and so this stuck out. Overall though it was a great visit.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80845af52a16f105:0x23ed098bfa86aabe< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful property with spacious, well appointed rooms and big modern bathroom. The highlight of the room is the private balcony facing the vineyards and mountains. So relaxing to enjoy a glass of wine out there.
Breakfast was very good and can be delivered to your room to enjoy on the wonderful balcony.
Very dog friendly property although for a fee.
Beautiful gardens around property and quiet relaxing pool area to enjoy.
Staff was friendly and helpful and our stay overall was wonderful.
Only negative. Too pricey to stay regularly.< /Review>

A cozy hotel with a beautiful view. We enjoyed peace and quiet at the private balcony here. However, there were stains on the towels... I was very disappointed to get this quality for $300-400 per night of Inn.< /Text>

<Text>We enjoyed our stay at the wine country inn. We had a gift certificate that we had been meaning to use forever, and decided to finally use it for a special weekend. Justin the manager is fantastic and gave us a free upgrade during our stay, and made it his job to make sure our weekend was special! He also gave us some great recommendations for vineyards and restaurants. The whole staff is very sweet and welcoming. A complimentary wine splitz (because COVID has cancelled their weekend wine tastings) was placed in our room as well. The inn was quiet and peaceful with a gorgeous view of a hill and vineyards. Sunrise is gorgeous there. COVID has affected a lot of things, but the food delivered to our room was delicious! It may be awhile until we make it back, but we will definitely stay there again.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

The rooms are incredibly cute and overlook a beautiful vineyard that you can wake up to in the morning with a cup of coffee. The staff is great (shout out to Justin!) and very flexible with check-in & check-out. Husbands— here is the play: wake up in morning and drive to Model Bakery (2 miles away). Grab a couple lates, a 6 pack of their LEGENDARY english muffins to go, and a couple pastries. Surprise your wife in bed and give her a quality kiss. Thank me later.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>We had a very comfortable and beautiful experience.  Room 24 has the most gorgeous patio and fantastic view of the vineyards. The manager Justin so helpful and gracious, guiding us to find local resttaurnats with our special vegetarian preferences.  Thank you Justin and staff for making my birthday stay so very special.  We are recommending your place to all our friends !!<//review>< pics>

<text>Positives: The room was clean and the reception staff person was pleasant. The grounds are pretty. Negatives: Overpriced for what you get. For over $500, the room was very noisy - normal movement from patrons above sounded like elephants walking walking around and we could hear them talking (again at a normal volume). We had a view of the fire escape. Disappointing.</text></record>

<review>This is exactly what we were looking for - quiet, fantastic views, comfortable rooms. It's hard to find a hotel in this area, at this price that puts you right in the middle of a vineyard. By sacrificing some of the services offered by the exorbitant hotels and resorts nearby, the Wine Country Inn gives guests the ability to bask in your surroundings at a more affordable price point.<//review>< Pics>

We used this hotel as the hotel were all our wedding guests were asked to stay, and as the bride and groom we also stayed here. We offered to buy out all the rooms of the hotel, and the manager, Stephanie told us that it would be more economical for each guest or couple to book their own rooms. When we asked our guests to do that, as reservations started trickling in, their website algorithm automatically raised the prices of the remaining rooms since we were creating high demand for that specific weekend. The lowest tiered rooms were three times the price that they originally were, based on the demand we created. When asking the hotel to reduce the price back to the origional price so that our guests can book out the remaining rooms, Stephanie refused and put a note on my account so that anyone I spoke to was aware that they should deny my request. They were elitists and said that they would get the business even if we don't buy out their rooms, so they weren't worried about accommodating our request. It was a terrible experience, and I would never recommend this place for wedding parties. I was planning an entire wedding and having to deal with the staff at this hotel causing me stress. The few guests that got stuck booking a but later, had to look at other hotels because Wine Country Inn refused to bring the price down. When I asked a staff at the hotel to escalate the issue to the owner or manager's manager, he said "you definitely don't want to deal with him". Sounds like they are all under a strict regime!</text>

This is a hidden gem! I have stayed at many places in the Napa Valley and this has been a pleasant find! Extremely clean property and the rooms are comfortable and clean as well. Full breakfast included with your stay and it was excellent, including the pastries from the wonderful bakery in St Helena. We will definitely be staying here again in the future!<//review>

Great location! Quiet and accommodating not far from the road (but you can't hear it whatsoever!). Five stars is near impossible, but it comes quite close at 4.5 stars for us.

Staying in the vineyard view cottage king. The suite is quiet and cozy and shares no walls with any neighbors, with a fun private patio, electric awning, fountain, a roomy bathroom with a jet tub for two, and three shower heads in a nice walk-in shower with a stone bench. Room service options include charcuterie and an assortment of wine (of course). The staff is fantastic, and did my favorite thing of being happily helpful when asked, but otherwise leave you to enjoy yourself. Breakfast was tasty, and they didn't mind we were a little late to the party after a long drive and nighttime arrival.

The fridge is wobbly, but quiet and functional. The fireplace isn't consistent in ours (leaving that thing turned off). The switches are a bit dated, but are dimmable. The bathroom is segmented by high glass walls, but otherwise is sectioned off by just a single door from the rest of the suite. Everything is very well maintained, ventilated, and clean, though. The HVAC, water pressure, and water heater all function perfectly, even down to the heated floors in the bathroom. Bravo.

Recommended for sure, and the price was reasonable as well!</review>

This is a very quaint hotel. I dont know the history but it appears to be a converted farm house or estate manor.  It is a bed and Breakfast type of layout that has cottages also.  This hotel is located near a number of excellent wineries. The rooms are very modern with nice carpeting and flooring throughout. The bathroom is also very modern with marble and glass. Our suite had an outdoor patio area for sitting. The grounds are nice to walk on. They have a heated swimming pool. The room had a small refrigerator and we received a small complimentary bottle of wine. Breakfast is provided in a patio and family room type of setting.   There are many options available for your breakfast enjoyment.  The room was very quiet and had a sitting area along with a 40+ inch television. All in all this was a very nice relaxing environment for a couples experience.</Review>

Location was perfect- we did not deal with traffic leaving Napa in the afternoon but were 20 min from any winery in the valley and walking distance from several of our favorites! Views were so peaceful and beautiful. Staff was excellent -accommodated several requests. Will definitely return!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Hands down one of the most tranquil stays I've had the pleasure of enjoying. The kind staff, the unique property, the gorgeous location, the serene views.. all contributed to a much needed getaway to rejuvenate the soul. Everything about this places makes you feel at peace. Most places offer a mediocre breakfast in the lobby but this meal was satisfying af. My favorite part was sitting on the back patio looking up at the stars while sipping a 14 year-old cabernet that was gifted from the staff (in the middle of a vineyard, mind you). When I return to Napa and am looking for a spot to stay, this will be my first choice. Thank you for the magnificent memory!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrTXXaWGthqbCFW55h2wQeUojIJkXzY4LW263a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>I was solo, spending the weekend at weddings and parties at resorts. This was the perfect quiet place to be at the end of the day, and upon waking up! I loved my view of the vineyards and the bed couldnt have been more comfortable. Perfect size room and bathroom and little balcony. The buffet breakfast was just right as well. Parking convenient. Overall a great stay - and I would stay there again!  Thank you!</Review>< Rating>

< Review>
When we arrived at Wine Country Inn & Cottages, our first thought was "this is cute!" We got checked in promptly, set our things down in our amazing room, then went to enjoy the complimentary wine tasting in the lobby (which is apparently limited to just a few weeks).

Unfortunately, the beautiful view from the room and great service from the staff was spoiled by the paper thin walls, and all of the noise that permeated them. All night and morning, we could hear EVERYTHING; people talking above us, every door closing, every footstep taken to a neighboring room. We were able to ignore it for most of the night, but were afraid to get too intimate in fear of neighbors hearing us as clearly as we could hear others.

The worst came at 5am, when one of our upstairs neighbors were up talking and moving about (for some reason). My girlfriend and I both had a really tough time staying asleep with all of the noise.

We took this little vacation to evade the noise that we typically hear around our apartment at home, but unfortunately, even our apartment was quieter than staying in this room.

Other than the noise, the location was great as well. Parking was abundant and we were about 5–10 minutes away from most wineries and downtown St. Helena, which made grabbing food or a glass of wine easy.

All in all, the experience at Wine Country Inn was pleasant, but due to the rough night of sleep alone, I doubt we'll come back.<//Review>

<Review>Amazing! Nestled behind Duckhorn, centrally located in the valley, picturesque with simply amazing rooms, complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese nights. The rooms over look the vineyard and as the sun comes up the wave of light reflects on the leaves in a way that reminds you of looking at the ocean. Worth the stay, serenity, and location.</Review><rating>5< /rating>< gmapID>

Nice property, has a pool and beautiful landscaping. There are a lot of nice views of Vines and the mountains. Our room was very large and had a Jacuzzi tub against a large window. I would recommend eating the included breakfast, the bacon and sausage were delicious. Nice selection of fruit and breads as well. The staff was friendly and professional.< /Text>

Absolutely wonderful hotel that exceeded my expectations by far. My wife and I enjoyed our honeymoon in the absolute gorgeous garden cottages. The bathroom was huge and spa like. Room was incredibly spacious and we had our own porch that was made private by shrubbery. Would definetely reccommendb to anybody that is looking to relax and enjoy wine country. One more thing, the staff was incredible, especially the lady that serves breakfast in the morning, those delicious breakfastes were awesome.< /Review>

The state came with endless amazing breakfast. Not just Continental, great quiches and cheeses etc. etc. Also it came with a free happy hour that was sponsored by a local vineyard. i cant wait to go back< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>We had a great experience here last weekend!  I accidentally booked the wrong hotel thinking we booked here and they were able to get us in with a rate less than I anticipated (although still very pricey).  The rooms were really cute with a fireplace inside and a gorgeous view.  The complimentary happy hour was wonderful as well as the breakfast.  I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay for a romantic weekend or even family getaway.  Would definitely return!</Review>< rate>

<Review>This is a lovely inn with beautiful surroundings. Genuinely felt like we were in Tuscany. Small, i believe there are 30 rooms. All recently updated and nicely appointed. No elevator though. Wonderful buffet style breakfast that came complimentary with our booking. Lovely friendly and accommodating staff. If you are going out to dinner, I recommend going to St. Helena instead of napa. We made dinner reservations for downtown napa and didnt realize that this location was about 45 min from there. St Helena was much closer and just as quaint.<//Review>< Pics>

The room was very spacious and had a nice sized balcony overlooking vineyards. Breakfast was delicious, even for someone picky like me.   We only stayed one night, so we will be back for a longer stay. I would like to relax by their pool, soak in the hot tub and enjoy the lush grounds. Best place for me in Napa area, no need to try other places anymore. We found our St. Helena home away from home.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>I brought my wife on our 10th anniversary.  We loved so much about this Inn. The staff was wonderful, the location ideal, the views fantastic, and the pool relaxing on 100 degree day.   The landscaping is beautiful and well kept.  Everything was very clean and the accessible.  From 5-6pm on both Friday and Saturday, they host complimentary wine tastings.  We were able to experience Schweiger and Orin Swift which were a very pleasant surprise.  The only issue we had was that our room was so dated.  It just didnt match the quality of the rest of the Inn or the pictures that you see online.  It was still very clean and comfortable with a fantastic view, but for the price paid they need to renovate quickly.  We still really enjoyed our trip but I would be hesitant to go back and would look for alternatives if I knew I was going to get one of the old rooms.< /Review><user_name>Orbitz reviewer< /user_name>< Response>

Furniture and bed is ok, but for the price you would expect something much better. The lady at the front desk does not care to help you.

<Text>We stayed 2 night at the Inn. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet tasteful and offered a nice choice of different foods. The view from our room was beautiful overlooking the vineyard (room no 12). The room was spacious. There wasn't any TV nor fridge in the room which didn't bothered us at all. Unfortunately I can't give 5 stars because the room was very dated (the bed very uncomfortable, the bathtub old, the toilet was making a leaking noise).</Text>< Pictures>

We enjoyed our stay here. The breakfast is great and the afternoon drinks and snacks were also really nice.

Room we stayed in was quaint. Felt like an old farmers actual guest room. Old style - I guess a bit outdated.

Great perk was that they will drive you to dinner at Napa restaurants.<//Text>

The experience was everything we could have wanted. The food was great, the grounds are beautiful and the room was so cozy. The fireplace might have been our favorite part, it was the perfect touch. The staff found out it was our anniversary and offered us a free bottle of wine to celebrate. They could not had been more accommodating. We will be coming back here for a long time!

P.s: The granola really is that good.<//text>

I stayed at the Wine Country Inn for a Napa weekend getaway in June 2016 and had the most amazing time. The hospitality was topnotch, the grounds are beautiful and well kept and the rooms are spacious yet cozy. I had one tiny issue while I was there which was not the hotel's fault at all, yet everyone working at the Inn went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of, and even gave me a special gift when I checked out. This place is a hidden treasure and I absolutely plan to stay here again soon.< /Review>

<Review>Wine Country Inn was a great little escape from the hectic city life for both me and my wife. Between the crackling of our fireplace and lack of TV and WiFi, staying here for even the one night was the perfect reset button. The building itself is relatively older, so there were lots of noises throughout the night, whether it was just the structure settling or from other guests, so it was a bit difficult to get a full night's sleep.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
So I’m not a big review writer but I felt compelled to share about this amazing place. We were on our honeymoon and decided to make a side track to Napa Valley. We found this Inn on yelp and decided to see if they had rooms available.  They did we stayed in there King Junior Suite for a week day we got a discount a killer deal, and the room turned out amazing. Huge king bed, cute sitting room with a fireplace (logs included) huge bathroom with a jetted tub and duel showers and a private patio that over looks the Duckhorn Vineyard.

The staff are the most friendly and sweet people you’ll meet. They truly try to go out of there way to make you feel at home. Complimentary waters and sodas in the room and each has a small bottle of wine waiting for you so you can start your visit off right.

Close to the city less than 5 min drive to the heart of St Helena. Has a pool and hot tube set away from the rooms so you don’t hear the noise. Tasty continental breakfast included. And as a bonus on Friday and Saturdays they have one of the wineries come in and do a tasting with some gourmet cheese and fruits.

Seriously best place we stayed the whole trip would recommend to anyone looking.< /Review>

Since it changed ownership it's not the same. Rooms updated but not really improved. They installed TV's but I didn't stay there to watch TV.  Breakfast used to be house made now it appears they serve pre made egg dishes that are simply warmed up. The piece of quiche I put on my plate was stone cold. Everyone is nice and all but it just lacks warmth. For what you pay you expect more.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1519142804779<//Time>< Response>

The room was nice the views were fascinating! the breakfast was delicious! WIlly as the best host ever. It was our first time in Napa and willie provided a lot of wineries to visit and places to see, Stepanie advised us to go Domanie Carneros on our way to the city. It was awesome! We loved all the wineries; food, and shopping, we are definitely coming back! Thanks for making my birthday wonderful!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80845af52a16f105:0x23ed098bfa86aabe< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Do not trust the pricing if you book online!! I booked, provided my credit card for the required 50% deposit, received confirmation of my reservation via email stating pricing and dates, and my card was charged for the 50% deposit. I received a call from the order desk stating due to a gliche with internet pricing my rate was incorrect. The price was increased by $2000 and a larger deposit was going to be charged to my card. I refused to pay anything additional and requested a refund. After multiple phone calls and more than a 2 week delay I finally received a refund. It blows my mind how a confirmed price via email was not going to be honored. Makes me wonder what other charges and fees would have occurred upon arrive. This is a fraudulent business practice and they will never get my business.<//Text>< date>

Das Wine Country Inn hat alle Erwartungen übertroffen: kleines, gemütliches und romantisches B&B mit allem Komfort - geschmackvoll eingerichtete Zimmer mit Holzböden und echtem Kamin. Das freundliche Personal war äusserst hilfsbereit. Ein grossartiger Stützpunkt, um das Nappa Valley zu erkunden.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Husband and I were driving around looking for a place to eat. We stumbled upon this place, and it was the best decision ever!

From the moment we stepped foot inside we were excited to try out the food. Caroline was sweet and attentive, she explained the menu and was very helpful as well. My husband and I ended up ordering a pepperoni pizza, meatball sandwich, antipasto salad and a large drink.

The antipasto salad was good, husband said the sandwich was great, but the pizza was absolutely delicious. The sauce, cheese, pepperoni, dough omg my mouth is watering..was amazing. It tasted fresh and it was cooked to perfection. The prices of these pizzas are a great deal too.

Another thing we noticed since we ate inside, is that there was a steady flow of customers ordering and going in. Caroline always greeted them and even when people phoned in orders she knew a few of the callers! So personable and professional.

We even took home 2 slices of pizzas and my mom and nephew loved it and asked where we got it from!overall, I'm glad we found this place and we can't wait to go back!</review>< Pics>

<Review>I went to Google to get the menu and phone number the price for the 14 inches Fiesta was $16.00 on the site they told me 15 to 20 minutes for pick up was there in 16 minutes. I was told now the price is 18.91 plus tax, I told them that I got the phone address and price and it showed a picture of the location on line and now I being told that's not them come on what is that all about. The picture and address and phone number I used to call them and its not them. Back to the pizza it wasn't hot. It was mostly cold. I lives almost 7 minutes away i had to warm it up to eat it. The taste was good, but will not go back as the lady serving me kept on insisting that it wasn't them online. I asked her how do you think I got here and you took my order with that number online. There is better pizzas somewhere else.< /Review>< pictures>

Pizza here is really good and it very affordable. The workers are very nice. Service is excellent. I always place big orders (for work) and they never fail to make good pizzas and delivery on time. I am yet to try their pastas and salads but I heard they are also good. Simple but very tasty.</review>

Antonious Pizza Riverside

I always come to this spot whenever I'm visiting the Mission Inn or checking out various events in the downtown area. Normally, I just get a scoop of ice cream (pistachio is by far the best flavor) and I am always met with excellent service, however I finally got the chance to actually dine here with a friend.   It's foolish to ask a Vegan person to come to a pizza restaurant but there are still a few options to go with. On this particular trip I decided to go vegetarian instead and tried their veggie sandwich which included a medley of veggies topped with mustard in a French roll.   The food was delicious but if there is one thing that stands out about this place it is their customer service. Every worker I have had the pleasure of talking to has always been a great mix of fun and helpful and if that's not something to make you come back, then perhaps the relatively low cost of their amazing food will!< /text>

Always delicious and at a great price. My brothers and I were coming to this wonderful pizzeria for nearly 40 years, back when it was a donut shop too. Just picked a pie up for my wife and daughter, and they (we) loved it.</Review>

Great tasting pizza at a low price. Good ingredients used. Definitely a great alternative to those 5 dollar pizza places in the area, you'll taste the difference</review>

The service here is always friendly and excellent. The food is outstanding. Something about the bread they make the crusts for the Pizza's out of is incredible. Even when you run out of sauce at the edge of the pie the texture and flavor is delicious. My wife and I have been enjoying Antonious  food for several years. We highly recommend this restaurant.

< Review>
Most my experiences here have been great, but on this particular day George gave you guys a bad name. I ordered 2 large pizzas. Upon receiving my pizzas I asked for cheese and peppers. George then proceeded to tell me he didn’t have either. I expressed that I wish that would have been addressed when I ordered the pizza. He then shrugged his shoulders and said he has “too much other stuff going on to be worried about that.”
I was shocked by that response and I told him that my pregnant wife might be extreme to the point of Complaining.
His immediate response was “I can give you your money back and take the pizza”
Again, blown away by the customer service response from George. He then walked to the back of the store and as I ask him if there was a manager in, he yelled back out to the front of the store, “Nope.”
As a business owner myself I would be very concerned at this level of customer service by my employees.
I pray that it’s address<//Review>

Just came home tonight with two beautiful, one topping, thin crust pizzas, for $5 each. Baked to perfection. All authentic and fresh ingredients...  Piping hot, fresh out of the box... Who can ask for anything more? (except rhythm, and music... and my gal.. you gotta know the song reference to appreciate this pizza review.) =) The best pizzas ever, in the Inland Empire and Riverside!! Thank you N&W!!! Grazie!!<//Review>

< Review>
They said the magic is in the sauce when it comes to eating at a pizza place. This restaurant has been around for a few years really Noble for their huge pizzas and pastas. The place has really good things to eat however beware they charge extra for petty things like well done pizza< /Review>

Great prices and the owners were very friendly. I used to work across the street from the store at Athena Research Group, but we moved downtown... Our office would order many pizzas back then from Antonious Pizza. Keep the doors open... Go try their food!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<username>Darth Neph< /username><text>.Great Pizza for Great price. Favorite spot in Riverside to grab pizza

Update:
Place hired new punk azz kids to work it recently. The pizza is great sometimes and a half cooked mess others. The Tall kid now working the front is a piss poor employee and an absolute joke when it comes to service and integrity. Our entire family atleast 2 pizzas plus a week x3 groups took our business to Enzo's off Indiana.  Thank your new employee for the loss.</text><rate>1<//rate></record>

We brought in a gem that had been purchased outside of Creations Fine Jewelers and the communication from beginning to end was great. Brian offered pretty much anything I wanted and worked with all of my ideas for a 1920’s / Art Deco style. I absolutely LOVE my ring and will definitely be back for the wedding band. Thank you so much!</Review>< pics>

I decided to step into the world of luxury watches and chose to start with Omega. I found Creations online and went to the Jewelers in person to talk about watches. I met with the owner, Brian, and he was genuinely excited to talk Omega and spent as much time as I wanted talking about specs and colors. Brian did not try and pressure me in any way. In fact, he told me to wait until he got all of the new color combinations in stock so I could make the best choice. My experience at Creations completely sold me on the character and quality of the people and product, and I knew I wanted to spend local. I purchased an Omega Seamaster when Brian called me to tell me all the colors were in. The experience was phenomenal, start to finish.</text>

<review>Absolutely the best jeweler you'll ever have the pleasure of doing business with. Not only did Brian help me from square one to design my wife's wedding ring he also gave me a robust education on diamond and ultimately showed me the incredible quality of "hearts on fire".

I worked directly with Brian to purchase a beautiful Omega watch.  He really knows watches, and it was great to "talk shop" with him about various products.  Before I visited Creations, I sent Brian several emails about the watch that I wanted to buy.  He always answered me promptly and showed great interest in helping me.  His pricing and service were unmatched.  Believe me, I contacted many jewelers before finding Brian and Creations.  No one could beat his service and fair, honest dealing.  I wholeheartedly endorse Creations.  THANK YOU BRIAN!</text>

I “Love” this jewelry store and how it always has something different, beautiful & unique to fit your desire & taste. Plus they are extremely helpful and willing to help you create something new from pieces you already have but want to change or update to suite your taste now.
They are also very friendly.<//text>

Brian helped us select wedding bands. They had a lot of variety; I was very picky and he found exactly what I was hoping for. Great customer service and quick turnaround. I had been to several jewelers before this and none of them compare. Highly recommend!</Review>

From start to finish the experience was fabulous!   Took in my engagement ring and a pair of earrings I seldom wore and told Brian what I wanted.   The finished product is an amazing ring that looks exactly how I pictured.

Friendly, professional service.   110% recommend!< /Review>

I also happened to be there when it was pretty busy (4 or so other couples) and overheard some of what was happening around me while I waited. They were friendly and engaged. When it was my turn, they were 100% attentive and even called a watchmaker to confirm what they thought the issue was, sending him a text photo right then for him review.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

But the most important thing to me is trust, my jewelry is sentimental and precious to me, whether I leave it to be repaired or when purchasing a new piece I TRUST...Thank you Brian and Melissa.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Every member of the staff at Creations Fine Jewelers is amazing. Seriously they have all accommodated me in various stages of my life. This is the same place that helped my grandmother with every piece of jewelry she ever owned. My dad comes here for my mom. My father in-law comes here for my mother in law. My husband would come here for me if I didn’t beat him to the punch each time!  They have an amazing selection of beautiful stones, settings, earrings, different posts for different uses, amazing watches and more.

They’ve replaced watch batteries for me, fixed broken items from watch hands, neck as clasps, earring posts, rings and even hammered out a very old and probably very inexpensive earring in my position for 16 years that was very wonky.

I cannot speak highly enough of the entire team. They do amazing work at a fair price while giving the best customer service possible.

Thanks again!!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>We consider Creations to be “our” jewelry store. Brian and his staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and so willing to accommodate us, whether we are just “jewelry case” shopping or actually want to make a purchase (actually, I always want to make a purchase). There are really beautiful, high quality pieces at Creations, but they make repairs, hunt through catalogs for us, and clean our things. We trust them.<//text>< Pics>

<review>When I lost one of my mothers (now deceased) diamond earrings I was devastated. After much research, I took the remaining earring to Creations Fine Jewelers and I couldn’t be more impressed. In less than 3 weeks they were able to match the diamond and Brian recommended updating the settings. The earrings are now more beautiful than ever and I couldn’t be happier. Highly recommend these guys!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I have used this establishment to purchase my wife’s engagement ring and our wedding bands! The selection is awesome and great quality! But I would say their service is the best! I had to get my ring re-sized and they were awesome! I had the wrong date engraved on the inside and they were amazing when I had to get it changed. By far top of the line experience!< /review>

Brian and his team did an exceptional job on my, now fiancé's, engagement ring and wedding band. I came in and wanted to completely customize and somewhat design the pieces about three months out from the proposal. They provided plenty of guidance and were very transparent with my options, while staying within my budget. I highly recommend them for anyone looking to purchase a truly special engagement ring.< /Text>

Great experience from a nice and well informed woman.  Didn’t try to upsell or give me something I didn’t want.  I believe she is part of the family that started the business.  Will definitely shop there again.  They were very patient with me, as I know little about jewelry.  Glad I had my daughter with me.   Well done</text>

<text>I cannot say enough about Creations Fine Jewelry ; their beautiful store has a relaxing and calm atmosphere .  Brian & his team really take the time to educate and work with you to make sure you get exactly what your looking for.

They have a great collection of Hearts on Fire diamonds and my new favorite Ippolita . Just try and resist  the turquoise lollipop ring in sterling silver with diamond pavé ... it’s dreamy!

Over the  past 20 years , I’ve had countless pieces of heirloom jewelry repaired and resized at Creations.   Whether you need a ring appraised, watch fixed or your Aunt’s antique brooch repurposed into a modern pendant,  you will enjoy working with this family owned company.<//text><user_name>M J< /user_name><rate>5< /rate><time>1619210573964</time>< Pics>

I visited Creations to purchase a wedding band for my fiancé. I couldn’t have been happier with the wide range of options they had for men’s weddings bands. I’d had a bad experience with customer service at the Shane Co and was very pleased to have a more personalized experience with the staff at Creations. I got the ring custom made and it turned out beautiful. Better than I could have hoped! I highly recommend giving them a visit for your jewelry needs.</text>

<Text>Creations Fine Jewelers helped me design a beautiful ring using stones from no longer worn pieces I now can wear every day. With Brian's suggestions, extraordinary customer service and great patience, I was confident I made the right decisions  and am delighted with my custom piece.

<Text>I moved away from my personal jeweler in San Diego and needed to find a Store that had the same quality of work, experience and hospitality that I was used to. I have frequented this store on numerous occasions to look at their inventory and was always assisted by passionate, knowledgeable and professional Associates. I just picked up a Custom Jewelry repair with Brian and was very happy with the entire experience and craftsmanship. Would highly recommend this shop over others in the Valley and look forward to my next purchase.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Date>1595532267264< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>While in Sicily on vacation I came across a unique diamond ring that my wife fell in love with. So of course I had to surprise her with it by sneaking away during dinner to return and purchase it.

Some years later a small diamond went missing and I was recommended by the ring’s designer to contact Creations Fine Jewelers to have it inspected.

Not only did Brian at Creations Fine Jewelers inspect the ring but he also went to bat for me and was able to send the ring back to Italy for repair at no charge.

Fast forward a couple more years and another issue occurred with the ring that needed repair to the band and again Brian and his staff faithfully inspected and obtained a full repair from the designer. This time the repair was not covered but Brian worked out a reasonable price  and the ring looks brand new again.

Service like this is rare to find when you aren’t spending thousands of dollars. And consider that I have never met Brian and his staff other than on the phone and yet they have my full appreciation and highest recommendations as truly Fine Jewelers.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

When the nice lady rang up my bill, it was only for the batteries and the cleaning was complimentary. I was pleasantly surprised.  :) The band on my Swiss Army Watch was a little tight so they put on another similar looking band which saved me $125 from buying the Swiss Army band and my watch has never looked better and felt more comfortable. The nice male associate also offered to do a quick steam clean to make my watch look even more elegant. Everyone there is super nice and all the jewelry and other watches look amazing too. They will absolutely see me again.</Text>< pics>

Always beautiful and unique jewelry, the owners and the staff are helpful, patient. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
I purchased a ring from them about 7 years ago and still getting wonderful compliments on its unique style.
Yesterday, a beautiful opal pendant that the owner designed.</Text>

I have had nothing but excellent experiences with Creations Fine Jewelers. Jeff designed a beautiful setting for my opal that my father had brought back from Australia years ago. Treasured memories now renewed in a pendant I can wear all the time. I have also purchased beautiful Hearts on Fire bands to go with the anniversary ring from my husband. They have a fabulous selection. You won’t go wrong from a simple watch repair, to finding new earring backs, to getting just that right piece of jewelry you have been looking for.

This place is your one stop shop. Their prices are very competitive. They do a lot of work in house. They can accommodate almost ANY request. They are so very kind and actually REALLY do care about you as a person. They really want to understand what you are looking for and what they can do to make it work within your budget. I HIGHLY recommend working with creations. Their customer service is superior to any jeweler. I've worked with Cartier and I prefer creations by far. The quality and professionalism combined with family owned and family oriented just puts this place above and beyond. You quickly feel like a part of a family here. You feel like they really care about your happiness and your input. I was in contact with the store for a couple months as I was educating myself and looking at other options. Creations was very patent with me and offered me many solutions and gave me other ideas and there was no pressure to buy. I'm so very EXCITED and proud to wear my new earrings and I'm very grateful for everyone at creations for assisting me in my purchase.<//Review>

<Text>Jeff is absolutely amazing. My husband got my engagement ring custom made by him & he did such a beautiful job that we went back and got both of our wedding bands from there. Jeff created my husbands wedding band with roman numerals for our wedding date and he really helped create something amazing just for us. He helped make it symmetrical so it didn't look funky with all the letters on it.  Jeff has always gone above and beyond for us and you really can't find more personable people them him and the team at Creations Fine Jewelers. Also, if you go in there's a good chance you'll be greeted by the CUTEST & SWEETEST doggy. For me that's ALWAYS an added bonus.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1573771528745, 'text': 'Jessica, thank you so much for the kind words! It is always a pleasure to work with both you.

This was a big purchase for me.  I typically don’t spend a lot on jewelry but lately I’ve become interested by fine watches.  Jeff spent as much time as I needed on three separate visits before I made my decision to go with a classic Omega.  At each step he and the team were respectful of me and my process.  On pickup day they were ready, professional, and accommodating. I’ll be back.<//Text>

While visiting family in the area I realized my Grand Seiko was a little to tight and brought it to Creations Fine Jewelers for a replacement band to get me through the trip. The owner helped me put a super affordable and nice band on my watch in under ten minutes and had a great selection from other top brands including Omega and some harder to find pieces by Grand Seiko and Tissot. 10/10 experience and will check them out next time in the market for a particular watch; Thanks again everyone</Text>

<Time>1577835758874< /Time><rating>5< /rating><Review>I had two pair of diamond earrings that I couldn’t wear as my ears are so sensitive. They were family earrings passed down that I had been holding onto for years. I wanted a pendant made out of one diamond, and a ring made out of the remaining three diamonds. I haven’t received the ring yet, but the pendant surpassed all of my expectations. I’m surprising my sister with it, and she is going to LOVE it! I also had a ring sized and I have to say that you can’t even tell that it was done, the workmanship is that great! It was fast too! Creations is now my go to jeweler, they have done an awesome job and I can’t wait to see the ring they are designing for me!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I picked up a little John Hardy bracelet for fun too, a happy birthday treat.

I have had lots of small repairs and cleanings done at Creations so I knew the team.  This made it easy to choose them when it was time for an engagement ring.  They did a fantastic job duplicating what I asked them to do.

This Jeweler is amazing. I had a custom diamond ring made somewhere else and it was mad incorrectly.  I brought it to Jeff and he had the ring totally remade and it is absolutely beautiful.  I have had no issues with it and it has been about a year now. I would trust Creations Fine Jewelers with my most treasured pieces without hesitation.

Brian and the team at Creations are great and always there to help in so many ways. I recently went in to get some earrings fixed and a necklace for a pendant.  Earring fix: no problem, and Brian had several suggestions for adding a small piece to my pendant to allow it to hang more naturally and securely. Worked out better than I had even expected!<//Review>

<text>I was looking for a jeweler to resize my gold wedding band. First time visit, I was attended to promptly by Michele and I explained to her what I needed. The job was done in 1 week. The ring looked brand new and was a perfect fit. They are very professional and courteous.<//text><date>1580446022341<//date><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

I recently had my wedding ring and band rhodium plated and they look brand new! Creations actually made my ring and I absolutely love it. They also made another ring for me and I love it as well. The service here is the best and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. I wouldn’t go anywhere else!< /text>

In fact, last Christmas I ordered a bracelet for my wife and Brian went out of his way to make sure it got shipped from Italy to arrive in time.
I wouldn't buy fine jewelry anywhere but at Creations.</review><rating>5<//rating>< gmap_id>

<Text>I grew up going to Creations Fine Jewelers with my dad over 25 years ago and love how I see some of the same faces from back in the day when they were in Bel Aire Plaza. They have always blown me away with there over the top customer service.

I just upgraded my wife's wedding band and Jeff went above and beyond my expectations trying to accommodate my extremely short time line and even offered when it was apparent that the ring would not be done in time for our anniversary to send a similar ring with return postage so my wife would have something to open and see what she had to look forward to.

If you are looking for any jewelry or watches, I would definitely recommend seeing them first, because they have made me a customer for life over and over again. You really can tell when a team loves what they do and this passion shows!!!

Brian and Melissa keep up the amazing work!!!i<//Text>< Pictures>

Jeff provided me great service.  He placed an order for a sample setting for an engagement ring that was not in their display so I could see it first hand and it arrived within a couple days.  All worked out well as I decided to purchase that same design.< /text>

<Text>My rings look so much better than how I brought them in. Beautifully done repairs and I totally trust them with my expensive gems. Sizing my wedding ring up was complicated on a custom made ring.  The scratches gone even the one flaw when first made in the gold setting was fixed to perfection!
I love that the overall cost was less than original estimate and the timing was so fast and you just can’t beat a third generation family-owned business in the Napa Valley with years of experience!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Brian and his team take time with their customers and are friendly and attentive. The repairs I’ve had done are fantastic, there is so much attention to detail, and in the last many years of taking my own and my clients’ jewelry and watches in for repair I have never been disappointed. They are efficient and thorough every time.

The store is beautiful and comfortable and there’s always plenty of parking, which is an added luxury to an already very luxurious experience. I don’t buy diamonds, but when I leave Creations By You I feel like a queen!

<review>Way above and beyond. Our son is getting married this weekend and last week I had this idea about repurposing a diamond ring that my wife's father left her. I told Brian the timeline and he took the challenge. He quickly and beautifully designed a diamond pendent using the setting and stones from the ring. To my amazement, the project was done and ready for delivery EARLY. My wife was absolutely thrilled when I surprised her and all is good in the kingdom! Kudos to Brian and his team at Creations. We have been long time customers so I've come to expect the impossible, and I was not disappointed. Thanks for making the wedding special for my wife!< /review>< userid>

Always friendly and helpful!! Our bracelet looks amazing!

Brian and staff are the best! I was lucky enough to recover a special ring in the rubble of my home from the LNU complex fire.  They cleaned it up, it looks amazing.  Still needs a little TLC but I trust that when I get it back it will look like new.
Thank you 🙏🏼</Text>

I took my Omega Seamaster 300M to Creations to get a battery changed. I had been considering for a while to getting a Planet Ocean 600M CO-AXIAL MASTER CHRONOMETER for some time.  That way I wouldn’t have to replace the battery in my 300 every 3-4 years. After Brian showed me several SEAMASTERS I got my Planet Ocean 600M. Brian gave me a great deal with military discount. I have owned a Rolex in the past and they are great watches, but it seems there are so many knock offs that appears many people own one, which they do not. Thank you Brian!!!< /Text>

This local jewelery business is an outstanding place to purchase jewelery. In particular, engagement rings was my product of interest. I chose this location because of a coworker that highly recommended it and also because it was local. I was approached professionally by the staff and also by Jeffrey. I was educated on the types of rings and styles, since i was new to purchasing an engagment ring, so for me it was important to learn about my investment. Jeffrey guided me from beginning to end of my purchase and gave me the best possible price for the type of purchase. I was satisfied with the engagement ring and the customization of the ring and I ended up buying my wedding band there too! I would highly recommend anyone to check this business out! I would most likely purchase from there again. Thanks to all the staff that made the ring extra special.< /Text>

I've been coming here for longer than I can remember, and Its gotten to the point that I just ask Brian to pick out what he thinks I should buy my husband.  Customer service is first class, and I feel lucky to have a jewelry store of such high caliber in my hometown.  There is something for every price range, but everything is high quality.  I might look in other jewelry stores while on vacation, but I only buy from Creations.

Words cannot express just what an incredible experience I have had (more than once!) with Creations Fine Jewelers.  Brian and his team have created a warm, welcoming and no stress environment which is genuine and much appreciated.  And that doesn’t begin to cover the gorgeous jewelry and watches – and the custom work Creations Fine Jewelers carries.
My first visit to the store was to fix a brand-new diamond ring where the diamond had fallen out due to a setting design flaw.  Brian had great suggestions about correcting the problem – which was going to continue to happen.  Creations fixed my ring – and the problem solved!  I’m wearing the ring confidently with the diamond intact!
My most recent visit brought me in to the showroom to explore options for updating/upgrading my wedding ring at my 10th wedding anniversary.  Michele led me through the process in an upbeat, but low key, no pressure manner.  I had an idea of what I was thinking about and Michele took the ball and ran with it!  She made suggestions about what we could do, but never pushed me into anything.  We did not pick the most expensive option – but one I was most comfortable with.  Brian made some design improvements and the result is the most stunning ring I could have ever imagined!!!  I can’t stop looking at it!!  The best part of the whole thing was that everyone working in the showroom became part of the process and were so excited for me with my gorgeous, re-done ring.  I have never had an experience like that – where everyone was just that excited and happy for me.
I can’t say enough about the amazing experience I’ve had at Creations Fine Jewelers.  Brian, Michele and the entire team are awesome, and I can’t say thank you enough!!</review>

< review>
I met Coleen seven years ago this month. On our 18th wedding anniversary, I decided to get my rings cleaned.  Well, Coleen examined them and told me I needed to get them worked on, diamonds were loose and the rings were worn. I couldn't believe it and grabbed my rings and went home to tell my husband.  I came back 2 days later and talked to Coleen about my options. She was so kind and understanding. She took time and listened to my lifestyle and educated me about the wear and tear I induced on my jewelry. Needless to say she and her husband helped my husband and I create a ring I can wear that was similar to my original yet perfect for my now. Thank you Coleen for your thoughtfulness and time you spent and continue to spend with me when I come in to get my jewelry cleaned.<//review>

<review>The team at Creations is absolutely wonderful. I went to Tiffany’s, Bvlgari and an independent jeweler in the city looking for an engagement ring and at each location it felt rehearsed. When I finally decided to check out Creations in Napa it was a completely different experience that was more informative and educational instead feeling sold. The quality of jewelry they have is on par with the best out there and their service is much more comfortable. Save yourself the time and trouble of visiting the city and go to Creations. I’ll be back for the matching HOF diamond earrings :)</review>< Pictures>

Jeff not only helped me pick out a ring and diamond, but he literally helped me design the ring. The crazy part is, he did it perfectly on his first try because he listened. Jeff listened to everything I wanted when describing the ring. My Fiancee loves her ring and the fact that it's a one of a kind makes it more special. I love the fact that nobody there was pushy and try to upsell me. Jeff kept it within my budget and I actually ended going over my budget because I wanted a Heats on Fire diamond (so worth it). Brian helped out as well and the service at Creations is better than you can expect, talk about top-notch service. The people at Creations Fine Jewelers really know how to make Your special moment special.<//Text>

<Review>SANDIE COOK - Creations not only gives great service, has a great jewelry selection, but always makes the customer feel welcome and recognizes repeat customers (which doesn;t always happen  in other jewelry stores I have visited). Coleen McCluskey is always "right there" to help, customers feel like friends, I know Mike and I do. Never feel rushed with her, she has helped us pick out the right jewelry many times over the years.

Creations Fine Jewelers has been my local jewelry store for many years. Not only have I been able to find the perfect piece of jewelry every time, I have had jewelry repaired and cleaned beyond expectations, and find it extremely easy and fast to replace watch batteries. The experience at Creations Fine Jewelry is exceptional because of Melissa and Brian Doughty, the long-time owners.Their level of expertise and customer service far surpass other local stores. Additionally, they go above and beyond out of consideration, compassion and generosity. This is easily identifiable with their actions during the recent Napa fires when they felt compelled to repair and restore jewelry damaged by the fires, at no cost to the fire victims. Highly recommend you pay them a visit and find your perfect piece of jewelry for your self or as a gift.< /Text>

I have worked with Coleen for many years. She is a delight to work with.  She knows what I like and what I expect. When I've called her to check on a piece, she replies to me personally either by phone or text. One of my items was taking a bit longer than expected. Coleen told me that it had been ready for me to pick up days before but it wasn't PERFECT! She called me when it was EXACTLY what I had created with her. I considered her a friend!</review>

<Text>I had a favorite pair of earrings that lost one oval onyx stone and wanted to replace it.  I bought new stones from a local jewelry designer and took them to Creations to replace the stones.  The new stones were just very slightly smaller than the original, and Creations said they would replace both the missing stone and the current stone so they'd be the same.  After I took the earrings home, I realized that the stones were not the same.  They replaced only the missing stone and not both. They didn't return the stone that was supposed to be replaced, maybe hoping that I wouldn't notice the difference.  Yet they charged me the price they quoted for replacing 2 stones.  I feel cheated and won't be going there again.< /Text>< pics>

<username>Corina Gonzales< /username><text>It’s pretty ridiculous to be waiting 20+ minutes for any given machine or equipment… this gym is way too packed, no matter what time of day or week you’re guaranteed to wait long periods of time to use something. Not enough equipment to use and way too many people here for that to be acceptable. Cleanliness is not a priority either- especially during a pandemic, there is not enough cleaning staff.<//text>< rating>

Their not doing anything to keep people safe by checking that every person at the gym is wearing their face mask. I tried contacting them because I don’t think it’s fair that others have to pay more $ than others and can’t use all the equipment in their plan. Not enough equipment and too dirty. As soonest my contract ends I will cancel it and find a better gym.< /Text>

<text>I came here after 24hour was forced to close, and I'm glad that I did. The staff are genuinely nice and are eager to help, unlike my old gym these people seem to care. Its also cheaper, which is great. They have done a great job with the outdoor gym, its clean and everyone seems chill. It also feels great getting your pump in while the breeze cools you off, keep it up Golds Gym!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Cancelling membership, they decided to unfreeze my account during the pandemic because apparently for them it's is not longer of importance. They did not even try to make it right so I'm done with them, paying the cancellation fee in order to no longer deal with these ridiculous people. They didn't even enforce pandemic guidelines when I was there, did not offer any sense of security from this pandemic. This place is a joke.<//Review>< date>

Gym is not doing their part to keep members safe and protect our community. I noted my concern on a survey the manager. Joseph reached out and  gave me a generic response. The gym is not being cleaned as it should and hopes that each member will clean after themselves. While at the gym I recorded a video of 7 different members using the same machine. Not until the last member was the machine cleaned. 7 different exposures then went on to use the rest of the gym. Not once did an employee come out to clean or check if masks were being worn in the 2 hours spent there. When I email back with my concerns in detail the manager Joseph didn't bother to respond. When I asked to freeze my account and wait for this to clear up they agreed. I was told to contact the manager which I did and still no response. This entire process starting in July and still no response. To make matters worse the same situation was happening to my elderly mother who can not risk her life to go to a gym who does not care about their members or the community.In a time where vaccines are not available for everyone. It's unfortunate to think how many people who might have died due to the gross negligence of this company and manager. I leave this review in hopes that it will save some people from getting sick.</Text>

Not the best it can be, but not their fault either. I've tried coming in late, early, and evenings as well, but its always packed! Early is probably the best but not by a long shot still. Everything is modern looking and clean, but it is heavily reduced in size and amount of machines due to covid-19 being a present issue to us all. That is the only problem with this setup currently. 5 stars overall once the place can be back to normal, which I can't wait for since I am new to this gym and never got to experience the whole thing. Work with what you got for now and it is better than not having any options.</text>

< Review>
Only had a membership since November 2020 at $20/month. That only equals roughly $100 to this day. Then they Literally stole two payments of $229 out of my bank account. Plus an additional 38.54, and have made no attempt to right the situation. If I stole $500 from someone I’d be in jail.

5/10 to update this. Joseph agreed to return half of my money. This never happened. Avoid this place and the scumbag who runs it.</Review>

<review>I wish I could give 0 stars. I had such a bad experience with this gym as a result of the COVID pandemic. It is so difficult to get out of your contract and they were even sued for that very reason by the Ventura County DA in 2013. I moved out of Oxnard because of the pandemic and the Gold's gym near my new home (Long Beach) was closed even though the gym in Oxnard was open. I signed up for one of the more expensive plans so I could have access to all gyms because I move around alot. Gold's gym Oxnard continued to charge me the same amount even though I wasn't getting the full benefits I paid for and I couldn't even use the gym! Then they made it nearly impossible to transfer my account to someone else. I drove up all the way to Oxnard after I was told over the phone I could make a transfer in person and when I got to the Oxnard location they told me I couldn't because I had to wait for my next payment or something. This was such a nightmare and I went through it from August to January. Not only was I given wrong information multiple times but the team members were so rude, had poor attitudes, and unhelpful. Yes Gold's gym is cheaper than 24hr fit but I guess you get what you pay for. It's not worse getting a cheaper membership because they will screw you over.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I’ve requested to speak with a representative via email twice and I’ve called multiple times to ask about my membership and I have yet to get a hold of anyone. I’ve been charged $50 twice for both my sister and my membership and I have no idea for what. I was also charged for a months membership even though I had frozen it and, I couldn’t even attend. It’s so frustrating to not get any answers.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Don’t go to this gym like your life depends on it. They take advantage of you and overcharge you any chance they get. Also no matter what time you go in, you have to wait 15 minutes for each machine and barbell.</review>

<text>Careful if you get your membership here the management staff is unresponsive. I tried to freeze my membership as well as my mother's due to the pandemic but unfortunately have not been able to get in contact with anyone in management even after numerous emails and screenshots.

Update

Don't bother contacting their retention team it's a big waste of time. Not only do they take weeks at a time to respond but are unlikely to help with a resolution. This gym definitely does not deserve anyone's patronage.</text></record>

Miscommunication on ALL levels . Membership agreements are separate even if theres a primary person that gets billed. Separate cancelation fees . Nonstop robo phone calls asking for updated billing no follow up email.  Gold gym handles membership but financial is ABC financial so if u have an issue with either one they will just send you calling to both coz neither one will admit one's mistake and just put the blame on each other.<//Text>

<text>Worst customer service I have ever received. I am never one to post or comment on a business because being a small business owner myself I understand the struggles one can be going through. However I also understand the value of service and I can guarantee this place is not it. I have had various gym memberships and I have never been treated poorly as I did at Golds Gym in Oxnard. Janeka is one of the managers and my first impression was of her on her phone texting as I was entering the facility. Not only did she not greet me but she also didn’t answer my questions or concerns. Instead she gave me attitude and spoke to me as I had no idea what was going on. I believe leaders should lead by example so hopefully Golds takes this into consideration when selecting their leadership team. The quality of customer service comes a long way, this industry isn’t for anyone and perhaps they should find a replacement for Janeka to better improve their service.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I canceled because it was always packed no matter what time of day and overall just super crowded. I went in person to cancel only to find out they can’t cancel my membership in person so they redirected me to a website I could do it through. I HAD TO PAY $200 TO CANCEL??? FOR WHAT? Especially during COVID?? Outrageous. It was super easy for them to sign me up and get my banking info but to cancel I had to go through such a hassle. Im going back to 24.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Love the place , switched from LAF, love the equipment, the space , the layout , how well they did in making the outside gym look like a real gym and not just a parking lot to work out of , and the staff is  always pleasant every time i have needed anything, I also love that I haven’t struggled for parking at all either even in the busy evening hours  . On the improvements I wish to see , is  that I wish there were consequences for the members who don’t comply w the mask requirement . I have witnessed and appreciate the staff walking around to remind everyone to wear the mask, everyone I know hates wearing the mask, and I’m sure the staff hates enforcing or having to remind people to wear it. But,  it’s for everyone’s best interests to protect ourselves .   Many times , there are too many wearing the mask wrong ( nose out ) and some w no mask at all. True during the evening hours ( 6:45 pm and later , weekdays) I want the gym to remain open and people who don’t comply will ruin it for everyone who does.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1605558255734, 'text': "Thanks for giving us a 5-star rating and recommending us to others.

<Time>1583639920379</Time><rate>5</rate><review>I’ve been a member of numerous gyms around the area. The old Golds, 24 hour fitness and others. By far the best gym I’ve been to. The morning staff is always on time and very pleasant. Can’t say that about all the others. There is plenty of squad racks and different work out stations to please everyone. The price is also a steal!! Me and my son currently attend for the price of myself at the 24. No longer a 24 member.

<Text>It's a beautiful gym, it exceeded my expectations. Though it gets busier than other gyms for 5am, there's plenty of equipment (like 10 squat racks! :D ) for everyone to not stand around waiting. AM staff are always friendly and helpful, and the early gym-goers are nice too,  great energy.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1582928375394, 'text': "Charisma,\nIt makes us happy to hear that you are enjoying our newest facility!\nWe hope you continue to enjoy your experience with us and we look forward to your continued loyalty.\n\nGold's Gym SoCal"}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80e84dc447c2af15:0x3b477ac86836678b<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>I've been a Gold's Gym member since 2015 and have mainly used both the Greenwhich street and Gateway locations. Both have great facilities and allow multiple different workout options - tennis, swimming, squash, group classes, etc. Highly recommend.<//review><pics>None</pics><rate>4<//rate>< date>

Do yourself a favor and do not sign up. It is way overpriced and they make it very difficult to cancel your membership.</Review>

Honestly since covid they closed down and I am struggling financially and I guess one day they started charging again and I called to cancel and was told I needed to go through all these loops in order to do so and pay $50 to cancel I just wish they were more supportive during these times</text>

The gym is okay. But the customer service is horrible.you have to call a special
Number to cancel your membership and you have to pay $200 to cancel if your contract is not expired yet. And once my contract expired and I canceled and they still charged me. Very disorganized and I don’t recommend this gym.<//text>

How about you enforce your own rules with regard to bags on the gym floor.  One day I saw 4 people almost fall on their face because of gym bags on the floor.  I had one person leave a bag right in between the Incline Bench Press' and I "accidentally" kicked it in order for me to adjust my weights.< /Review>

<review>I give it a three star rating because it's a brand new gym and equipment is already breaking and the turn around time to get the brand New piece of equipment fix takes awhile. Girlfriend tried to use the Sauna (steam room) was broken and it would take a week to fix. Plus, you need to be wearing a bathing suit or a towel to utilize the steam room. Which wasn't presented during the soft opening tour of the gym. I will give it a few more months and re-evaluate. If unplease, back to 24hrs.</review><user_id>115990069831877515655<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

The current, World's Gym in Oxnard used to be Gold's Gym. There are still some relics there that indicate this (stickers on equipment and doors.) Anyways I just want to give the community a warning as back when Gold's Gym was around they engaged in extremely illegal and sketchy practices. Like automatically renewing your membership unless you mailed them a letter saying otherwise, through snail mail by the way, and with tracking otherwise they'd deny you ever sent it. Luckily I heard about other's experiences and was able to dodge such bullets but it was awful. Just a warning from a local Oxnard resident.</Text>

....Early bird gets the worm......
These hours to me dont meet Golds Gym criteria to be known as an elite gym. Maybe this is incorrect (HOPING) But 9am- 9pm does not play into a role of someone tryin to get a great work out and cardio in at 5 6 in the morning to start there proactive busy schedule for the rest of the day....< /Text>< name>

(Translated by Google) I loved how this gym will look! I give it 5 stars because it offers much more than the others in Oxnard at a more comfortable price, I chose the best membership that has everything included for me and my family and they gave me the second year for free because I referred 3 friends !!! I am delighted with the service and guidance they gave me. God bless you.

Food was so good! This pho place is one of the best for sure! The broth is so flavorful and delicious. The drinks were tasty! The Thai tea was sweet enough, a lot of places make really sweet bobas but this one was perfect!

The service was awesome! There was a bus boy always asking if we were okay or we need it anything. Attentiveness is definitely a must and this place got it!

8.26.2020 Outdoor seating available! Pay at counter first. I felt very safe when I came here. I called ahead to see if they had seating for us and it seemed like they would’ve taken a reservation for a larger party. We come here pretty often and they’re always so nice. They all speak good English and will help you if you are looking for something you saw on yelp or something. Delicious!<//text>

Not everyone cook noodle can call it Pho. And putting rice, chicken, salad to call it chicken rice. This is one of that experience<//review>

Favorite spot.

The broth is the best in town. Doesn't make you want to hurl like many other places. Never disappointed with this place and I likely eat Pho 2 times a week.

I've been to more than half dozen other places. Not at all satisfactory.< /text>

Tasty pho tai nam (rare beef and brisket beef). Taste of beef is better than pho bo in Vietnam. Only pho noodle is not the same as Vietnamese pho.
Nice service. Reasonable low price.
Fried tofu is ok.< /Text>

The food is absolutely wonderful! Best mixed fried rice I've eaten since back in Texas. And the ice lemon tea, simply the best of all time!
The service however leaves little to be desired. The place is way too busy to only have two waiters/servers. They literally have lines of people waiting outside and those two poor kids were running around like crazy trying to serve everyone! They even got my order wrong because of that. If they get more people, then definitely worth five stars! Will still go back, just maybe not on a Friday night.</review>

The soup has good flavor, but too much oil floating. They have enough rice noodle, but not well spread, with some tangled together. The pepper sauce can be a little darker and denser with more real stuff. Overall it's a good Pho restaurant.<//review>

Most Pho places are fast on service, which this place was fast and great. The menu is kept simple; had the basic appetizers, pho,  vermicelli dishes, and rice dishes which I enjoy because it makes it easy to choose something when you are pressed for time. So far their egg rolls, chili lemon grass chicken with rice, pho dishes have been delicious. I will definitely be back to try other dishes.<//Text>

I've been a regular at Pho Ha Noi for the past 4-5 years, and it's definitely one of our local favorites. Granted, you can probably find better Vietnamese food in Little Saigon in Westminster, but for locals in Irvine,  Pho Ha Noi offers good food at good prices at a convenient location. My two favorites are the chicken rice noodle pho and the chicken pan friedn rice noodles.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Reasonably priced, fast service, and great pho. I love that they’re not trying to hipster or modernize the place up, but keep it very Vietnamese-American in decor. It feels like I’m eating deep in Westminster or Diamond Bar, not “the OC”

I have only had their pho & coconut juice (same order every time) and they’ve both been on point each visit. I consider this quite an accomplishment for the coconut juice as most places I’ve experienced a big fluctuation of quality. I especially like that they add soft & delicious coconut meat into the drink!

I’d definitely recommend that you try their pho and to support this local small business!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

It is very difficult to find good pho these days. There's no shortage of pho locations, but even the top place tend to slip. If you want a pretty good pho place without the crazy wait, Pho Ha Noi is for you. Especially you live near by, the other Irvine pho places are not the worth the drive and wait.

It's nice to get the same friendly service every time that I go. I'm guessing that it's family owned and nothing taste better than family made pho. It's easy to love a place when you can build a repore with the staff.

The food here is very basic- nothing fancy, but I like that. They do use MSG, but it doesn't seem to over power the taste of the food. I like the pork chops and rare steak pho. It won't win any awards, but if I'm hungry and don't feel like waiting this place isn't busy most of the time. I've gone here during busier dinner times, but I usually get my food quickly. You won't see the normal Vietnamese people talking loudly to each other because they don't want to work. You have to go else where if you want to experience that.

Food when you want it and it's not fast food. Try Pho Ha Noi!</Text>

Food is solid but a big plus was how accommodating they were when I mistakenly order 4x of the wrong item (though I do blame it on the menus bad typography).< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Recommended to go as soon as lunch is opened. Then the broth was fine. If you go late in the evening, you can experience the soup, which is not your taste or taste.

점심 문열자 마자 가길 추천. 그땐 국물이 괜찮더라구요. 늦은 저녁에 가면 니맛도 내맛도 아닌 쫄은 국물을 체험할 수 있음<//Review>

<review>Ive been here for like 3x now the first 2 i came its been really nice but one of the employee name nate who i never met is really bad barber. He rushed my haircut, the haircut turns bad.  I didnt complain because i just notice when i get home. Im not saying to stop coming to this barber shop but make sure when they cut your hair, check if your hair has mis align or not even.</review>< pictures>

< review>
Moved to California 5 years ago... and been going here for 5 years. They made me feel at home, almost like brothers. Before the covid-19 madness they used to invite me to go hooping with them on Sundays. Only complaint is I haven't had a cut from them since March because of this Coronavirus sh*t.<//review>

<text>The best barbers in The East Bay since 2010. Family friendly, children's haircuts, women's styles, hipster beard manicuring, they do it all here.

They always have 3-5 guys who cut any kind of hair and literally all of them are skilled to do your hair cut, no matter how particular it is. I'm particular about my hair: every barber here has nailed it, every single time.

No rush, or in a rush: they accommodate it all.

Also available by appointment any day of the year!

If you or anyone you know needs a haircut: The Cutz Barbershop in front of Chabot College and next to Smokey's Smoke Shop is the only place to go.

You'll finally feel that the price for a haircut was really worth it with The Cutz.

The Cutz Barbershop is hands down better than SuperCuts, Great Clips, etc., etc. These guys perform haircuts with all the bells and whistles. They don't cut corners here, just any hair that needs cutting.

Don't waste your time or money at any other shop. Save your self the embarrassment of having to grow out a failed haircut.

Get your hair cut, here, at The Cutz Barbershop today!

(*DISCLAIMER* I was not compensated in any way, shape or form, to write this review. I was not asked by any affiliates of The Cutz Barbershop to write this review. I am a customer of The Cutz Barbershop, as well as the IT Technician on contract for this location. I wrote this review on behalf of my own free will in this way simply because The Cutz really IS this good. And because I'm a YouTube Content Creator by the name of RypeDub so I always tend to be obnoxious when promoting a product or service I genuinely enjoy.)< /text>< Pics>

Probably one of the best barbers I've ever met, he's fast and accurate. I thought he gave me the wrong hair cut, and was gonna tell him but then I recalled "exactly how i described" my haircut and looked again and it was cut "exactly how I described" if anyone leaves a bad review, you probably gave a bad description of the style you wanted.

"The sum it up"

*Fast
*Clean
*Accurate
*Affordable
*Relaxed

<Review>Writing this as I'm sitting here.
Came in at 5pm... its 6:45pm. And I'm still sitting here. Seems like they saw EVERYONE sitting as well as EVERYONE who walked in before they looked at eachother and said "okay he'll get you next". But then that same guy pointed to SOMEONE ELSE and said "he got you next".
I just moved here and I am looking for a place with good barbers cuz I cut my hair every week. But I cant afforded to sacrifice 8+ hours a month waiting for whoever "feels like" cutting my hair...< /Review>< rating>

Was not told when I would get my cut or acknowledged in any way once I got there. Waited an hour and then left. Could have just told me they could not take me in and I would have been completely fine with it. Poor customer service.

Their beard game is strong friendly guys and cheap as well always a good conversation you just  need an appointment for sure and be there 10 mins before because a lot of walk ins and if you walk in expect to wait 45 to and hour and half< /Review>

< Review>
So due to an "accident" which led to an excessive amount of hair being cut from my 18 month old at the time, we came across this location as the closest place that caters to children. We were happy to see the seats were in the shape of toy cars which amused my kids. Kassie was very sweet and caring towards my son's first haircut which he didn't even noticed was happening. We were also provided a nice little certificate to commemorate the haircut along with a little lock which I thought was a nice little touch.<//Review>

<text>I called in to make an appointment and was told there was no available appointments and was abruptly hung up on before I could ask any other questions. I noticed that through Google that I could make an online appointment, which I did. I got a confirmation email saying that I had a confirmed appointment for 1:30pm. I called back to confirm and once again, by the same person, was rudely told that is not an appointment it's a reserved spot for their walk in. The confirmation said reserved spot for 1:30, it said nothing about walk ins or I would have to wait. As I tried to communicate with her she continued speaking with an extremely frustrated and agitated tone. I even asked her to stop being rude and she said "well we're really busy with back to school"
It's safe to say I will not be taking my business there.< /text><response>None</response><Rating>1</Rating><UserId.>103895185218667985202< /UserId.>< pictures>

All of the stylists are amazing and know how to work with little kids. I do recommend making an appointment ahead of time because they get very busy - but with an appointment, they see you on time.<//Review>

If I could give zero stars I would. When you call and ask if walk ins are welcomed and they say yes and then you drive all the way down to them and the door to them says sorry no walk ins. Thanks for wasting time.< /text>

<review>Apparently they do not take appointments online. Arrived 4:20 to an appointment I had at 4:30 with a Nikki and they said they could not take us. Waste of time.
You guys should really remove that if you guys don’t accept appointments online to avoid anyone else wasting time driving over there.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<review>I used to love this place for my son's hair cut. The stylist are all great with the kids but it just kept getting more and more expensive. With a son who ok needs a haircut every other week if not sooner $25 every cut was just too much for a child.<//review>< date>

The stylist was super patient with both of my boys, even though the 2 year old cried through most of the haircut. I appreciated that! She kept the lollipops and Mickey Mouse coming. She was fast and their hair turned out adorable.</text>

<Review>We got a bad vibe the second we walked it.  First, the girl working was annoyed that we didn't we have an appointment.  (Don't "welcome" walk-ins if you essentially don't want them) Second, the appearance of the salon looks like a dog groomer.  Third, the train table is disgustingly dirty, I would not allow my son to play with it.  Forth, we were told the wait would be 40 min., so we signed in and left to get some food.  We were back within 30 min and were told it would be another 15 min. because she had to cut her "appointment" first.  Went back in in 10 min. and waited another 20 before being told that 2 more kids were ahead of my son! They were appointments that showed up late! And when the little boy got a little fussy with he knew it was his turn, the girl said "OH GEEZ!" and couldn't be more annoyed that he may be a difficult customer.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but shouldn't people working in a kids salon, LIKE KIDS?!?  And the kicker.....all 3 of the "girls" (in their 30's but totally immature) working were talking crap about a worker from different location.  I mean, ZERO professionalism. I used to own my own retail store, and if I knew that my employees were acting this way, they wouldn't be my employees anymore.  Oh yeah, and talking about going to see Magic Mike while getting ready to cut a 10 yr. old girls hair! OMG!  So we left and went across the parking lot to Fantastic Sam's and had the best experience for my sons 1st hair cut!  Ask for Nancy, she was great!<//Review>< gmap_id>

Incompetent staff, doesn't know how to do simple cut for my daughters. Charged $45 just spraying and fixing their hair that literally took 5 minutes! Looks no different than how it was<//review>

The hair stylist did a terrible job with my son's haircut. She made him cry when she used machine on back of head and then she cut him on his right ear. My son is 8 years old and not moving or standing like a toddler. She wasn't social with my son and didn't even apologize. Terrible hair cut experience for him. Beware parents! Keep a close eye on your children when they get their haircuts. His haircut was done on 9.12.15.< /Review>

<Review>What a horrible  experience. Rude employee. Don't bother going into this place. Employee was  very rude to me as if I was waisting her time. I have my own business and if I had employees that  treated my customers in the manner in which I was treated they would no longer be working for me. So I went across the parking lot to Fantastic Sams were the experience was way better and respectful. I was so upset with how I was treated, while I waited for fantastic sams to cut my sons hair I felt compelled to call my wife and tell her what had happened. When she answered I told her I took our son to Cool Cuts..... As soon as I mentioned Cool Cuts she said to me right away" I do not take him there anymore because they are rude." I started to laugh, as I told her well thats what I just experienced. So i guess this is not an isolated incedent. Don't waiste your time and go some where else to get your kids hair cut.< /Review><Name>Darryl Grace</Name><userid>116411108223115043017</userid>< rate>

Due to Covid restrictions we are currently only accepting call in appointments.  We are not accepting walk ins or online check in walk ins at this time. Masks and temperature checks are required. Only one parent and one child per one stylist admitted into salon at a time.< /Review>

<text>Saturday about 12:30 PM we were seated after a 1 minute wait and had iced tea at the table 2 minutes later.  My wife orders a spicy south of the border bowl with prawns and I had the classic  cheese burger with fries, my burger was better than I expected and to say the least, better than most other restaurant burgers costing twice as much and the fries were spot on.
I  didn't try the bowl thing but the wife said it was right at the border of being to spicy.
The waitress was perfect.< /text>< Response>

It was so nice to dine in for the first time in a few months. Applebee's did not disappoint either. Both the service and the food were on point. Thanks for a great night out!< /review>

After being seated, we waited over 10 minutes before someone asked if we wanted something to drink. After that, our waitress disappeared and our food was served by various staff members. When my drink was low, nobody offered me a refill. The food came out late and finally the server returned at the end to see if we needed anything.</Review>

<Name>Holly Christian</Name><Time>1617404247484</Time><rating>1<//rating><review>I honestly wasn't expecting much from an Applebee's but somehow they still disappointed. As a group of three, we waited over an hour around 7pm on a Tuesday night to be seated. The hostess originally said it would be 30 minutes. I totally understand and support COVID restrictions and difficulties but there was ample seating both inside and outside of the restaurant with multiple parties leaving during that time frame. The hostess and staff never acknowledged the wait time to us. We also waited over 10 minutes once seated just to get our drink orders.  My veggie burger was dry and crispy?? and there was no cheese even though I asked for it. The waitresses were pleasant and nice but not the fastest. There was one staff member working take out that was hustling hard. I thought maybe the restaurant was busy or under staffed but I actually heard one waitress say "I'm glad it's slow tonight because I start a new day job tomorrow. I didn't make any money tonight". We also had 3 different waitresses because ours went on break during the meal, which is fine, but we waited and didn't have the best service because of it. I also overheard a manager and waitress talking about this location saying "the management isn't good" and "it used to be a lot different."  I still tipped over 20% because it isn't the service staff's fault and these are tough times but ... literally NOTHING went right during our trip there. I thought I was being Punked.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Love the wonton tacos you can almost make a meal out of them.  Always consistent quality and generous portion sizes. I have dined at the in Santa Rosa location by Costco on 3 occasions over a 4 year period and each time our orders were either forgotten or the wrong meal delivered.

This Applebee’s is probably the worst I have gone to, extremely unprofessional. Also whenever you place an order online through Uber eats or door dash it takes forever until you call them and let them know it takes a while and then shows up cold.< /Review>

< Review>
Just went to dinner here and it was by far the BEST dinner I’ve ever had that I did not cook myself. I’ve been to Applebee’s before but it was not like that. Whoever is in the kitchen tonight is getting DOWNNNN. Everything was cooked perfectly, so on point. I had the blackened Cajun salmon with garlic green beans and mashed potatoes. The salmon was like butter on the inside but not flaky and nice and crispy on the outside. The spinach artichoke dip was AMAZING and the hottest I’ve ever had it. My husband had the burger and chicken & shrimp from the 2 for $22 menu. The chicken was cooked perfectly to where it was juicy but not pink, the onions were caramelized but still had a little texture to them. I ordered a mango dragonfruit lemonade that came out like candy, so good. And the service was impeccable. I wish I remembered our servers name because she was so nice and so quick. Overall best restaurant experience I’ve ever had. Better than any expensive 5 star place I’ve ever been. Will DEFINITELY come back to this location.<//Review>

My older sister even worked here for a long time. So we've had our Red Apple card for a long time. We were told by my sister and a few others to never get a new one because they changed their discounts. (Old card says 20% off. New card says 10%) technically if the card we have says 20%... they have to honor it. So today we were refused the discount. We were told to get a new card and we refused. Totally wasn't our server's fault, but the manager was too busy to see us. Not sure if I should keep coming back.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Great service most of the time. However, our server forgot to refill our drinks in at least two ocations.
Other than that everything else was really good!
Today the service is great since they have to maintain the social distance between tables. Which helps on getting service much quicker!<//Text>

<review>Best place to.come for food and drinks. Two happy hours: 4 pm - 6 pm and 9 pm - midnight. 1/2 price appetizers and amazing deals on drinks. Bartenders are amazing and drinks are good!  If you come here often, they will remember your name and what you like to drink. Just come on over!  You will have an awesome time!!!</review>< Pics>

<Review>While it may not be a gourmet restaurant, it certainly doesn't claim to be either. If you want to get dinner for a large group or your family without breaking your bank, then this is the place to go. And if you want cheaper drinks, then their evening happy hour is an excellent opportunity to grab a very appetizers or entrees to share and hang out with some friends. Plus, there is trivia available at every table that you can play and compete against other people in other restaurants. Definitely have spent many fun evenings here with friends.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x8085060f89b7ac43:0xb0db1097221c151e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Though they were short staffed and only letting in so many people at a time, the food was really good and our server Dani was very attentive. Everytime I looked up they were all cleaning. It is a strange new world so it was nice to go out with hubby & kids for a "normal" Father's Day dinner. I got the Cheeseburger protein style with a side of broccoli and it was delicious!! Hubby tried the chicken with stuffed ravioli and garlic breadsticks.kids went for fiesta lime chicken and french onion soup. We are all trying to stay safe and cope so it was a pleasant night out with family at Applebees.</text>< Pics>

My family and I go to Applebees once every few months. We went most recently on Valentine's day. They were pretty busy and our server was quick and attentive. Our food arrived in the expected amount of time and was hot and tasty. My husband got a full rack of ribs that were delicious, just about fall off the bone tender and just enough sauce without being too much. I would recomend this location to friends and family.< /Text>

Great service and good food. The waitress got our food out fast because my partner had to be back at school shortly. Also, she brought us to go cups for our drinks. Super nice!<//text>

<text>How was Applebee's Grill? Frankly, not that great. The staff was friendly and polite but it doesn't really make up for the lackluster food or drinks. It seems like at some point in the last 10 years places like Applebee's became fast food joints with draft beer, which does sound pretty cool. So if you know that walking in then this restaurant is probably 4 stars. But they market themselves as a "Bar & Grille" and based on that Applebee's is 2 stars.< /text>< user>

Food is uninspiring. Staff were barely friendly and inattentive. Place was freezing cold at 5:30pm customers were going out to their cars for hats and gloves. When asked to turn heat up waitress responded she was plenty warm.</Review>

<text>No service at all. I waited 30 minutes just to talk someone. The registration counter was deserted the entire time. When I finally got someone's attention and asked for the manager, he literally refused to offer us a table,  although the restaurant was only half filled at that time. In 15 years living in the U.S. this was the weirdest restaurant experience.< /text>< name>

Corporate comfort-food, nicely done. Despite being a big chain restaurant, this one manages to feel like a genuine neighborhood eatery, with a lot of local regulars. Food is at the exact mid-point between McDonald's and French Laundry. Know what to expect and you won't be disappointed. Great service from a generally upbeat staff. Nice.</text>

<Text>Pretty tasty meal. The menu has an option for just about anybody including a fair amount of specials like 2 entrees and an appetizer for x amount.  Go during happy hour to save a little dough on your drink a and appetizers as well.  This is conveniently located and usually doesn't take too long to get your meal and be out of there quickly. The service was excellent during my visit.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Directed towards Darla...9/23/18...5 stars for her for customer service, satisfaction and review. Will remain a weekly to bi-weekly customer when we weren't sure if we were going too. This is a wonderful establishment led by top quality management. They need to keep Darla around shes a great asset. - Sam</review>

So many mistakes. My fajitas came with  bacon, which I told them to leave off,  so they brought me a fresh plate. Nope! Once I dug into the dish it was obvious that the cook just picked the bacon off of the top. Gross.</text>

<Text>Terrible experience. We weren't greeted by the host. We had to walk up and ask for a table. And then once we finally got a table it took the server 15 minutes to come to our table. We finished our appetizers before I got my drink from the bar. And I had to ask a couple times for water. There was also a free appetizer promo going on and we asked our waitress about it and then she never came back to our table. We asked someone else to speak to a manager and he was nice and gave us appetizer coupons but overall it was not a good experience at all.<//Text><date>1543644911213< /date><username>Candis Hatfield< /username><userid>115166081458985437431< /userid>< gmap_id>

I usually get great service here at the Napa Applebees, however I used the app to order and paid for items we unfortunately did not get. We did call and spoke to a manager and he said that he would comp us and email me the coupon for that comp however I still never received it. When I go there again probably yes it is conveniently down the street for me and the food is usually well enough. I just hope the service quality what continue to deplete<//text>

Service was attentive and friendly but sadly the meals were so bad. I’m actually was in pain after eating half of what they call a healthier meal: shrimp with stir fry veg and rice.

Restaurant was extremely cold and customers had to wear their coats inside. Poor management is to blame.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Hopefully your food doesn't taste like it was microwaved because my food sure did. Especially my fries. I've microwaved fries MANY times in my life and this is exactly what they've been tasting like. Maybe there's new staff or cooks....

The food was nothing special. My family and I agreed we would've had better tasting food going to one of the local fast food restaurants.I ordered a mudslide and my son ordered a milkshake. By the time we got them they were straight liquid & semi warm. The waiter was decent and professional which is the only reason I did not give a lower rating. We will not be going back to this Applebee's.< /Review>

Went in today and we waited for our food for over an hr. We ordered appetizer.. boneless wings and mozzarella sticks. We only got the mozzarella sticks before our meals we then got one of the meals and a kids meal. After 20 minutes we got another of our meals and the other kids meal after 10 minutes of that we got our last meal needless to say we all didn't eat at the same time and then 10 minutes after we all had our meals our boneless wings were ready. The chicken and ribs were under cooked. I'm not sure if they had new people working the line but this is not acceptable.  Our waitress was good. Theres only so much she could do if she didn't have the food to take to us. We could tell she was getting a lil frustrated with the kitchen people< /review>

<Text>Our family went this past weekend. Service was very good, our waitress was very patient while taking our orders. The food was a disappointment, I have been at this Applebee’s before and have not been disappointed. This time it did seem like food was placed in a microwave and just heated. I would have given this place a better rating but the food really disappointed. One more thing, it seemed like the people in the back had their own thing going on because you could hear the music playing very loud.<//Text>< pictures>

Sub-par food today and the waiter didn't ask about it at the appropriate time. Fish was hot and our fries were cold. Bizarre burger and too heavily breaded onion rings. Not good recipes.  The hostess didn't say one word to us, entering or leaving.<//Text>

And we also had other waitress helping us more than she did . She gave us this attitude of I don't like doing this . Food was good for us the adults . I don't recommend ordering kids pizza  Nether of my kids where interested in eating it . I love pizza so what ever my kids don't it I would not this time do .Thank good for the mash potatoes .<//review>< pictures>

<review>I ordered a bourbon street steak, and it was half the size of what I used to get.  What happened?

Edit: Owner reply did't say anything...???  Need to use social media effectively.  Adjusting down to 1 star.

To add to my experience, I mentioned this issue to the waitress that night.  She didn't mention this to the kitchen or manager...  Applebee company website doesn't mention changing portion size of this steak.  I ate this same entree for years in Fresno.  The steak that night was half the size.  I'll remember to take photos in the future for reference.  I won't be going back to this location, though.  There are many other restaurants near by.  I made the wrong selection that night.</review>< Pictures>

I just ordered to go and the lady told me I need to come in to get my food at the bar, but then she can deliver outside to the car next to us? Terrible customer service. The lady also tried to argue with me on the phone when I asked about the menu prices. Unecesary hassle for overpriced food.< /review>

Napa locals love it, it's the nighttime version of Black Bear Diner.

Really good happy hour deals, the customer service here is better than any other Applebee's I have visited. Great place to come and unwind, grab a beer and watch some sports.<//Review>

< Review>
Waited 10 mins (it was slow)for a server.. ended up getting the hostess to get my drink. I asked for decaf tea and got caffinated tea. Ordered double steak and eggs, only got one piece of steak. However, management came over, apologize, and fixed the problem.. when time to pay the bill, I had an additional charge for something that I never ordered. Server did take it off... just make sure you get and pay for only what you order... other than that the food was good.< /Review>

The fish and chips was very good but could have been a bit crisper. Applebees isn't set up to handle groups this large. We had 8 at a large booth and 5 at the booth next to us. Food server was friendly and provided great service. I recommend Applebees. There are many wonderful items on the menu.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>On Oct. 17th my Husband and I our 35 years anniversary dinner and it was very good. We noticed the couple next to us and it was her Birthday the staff came out and sang and treat. My Husband wanted to take me  back for my Birthday  on November 4th we went to Applebee's for my Birthday my husband told the waiter it was my Birthday and he wished me a happy Birthday needless to say nothing was said or done after that. I was disappointed as well as my husband the young man wasn't very attentive as he could have been. Dinner was very good never the less.< /text>< Pics>

First, we were told that there is a 10 minute wait  when I counted 12 tables that can accomodate 4 people.  Then it took 30 minutes to get the appetizers and another 30 minutes to get part of our order (1 hour wait for the main dish).  Such a disappointment!< /review></record>

As we arrived we were told to wait 10mins when we actually waited 20. The assistant manager was very disorganised and didn't know what she was doing.

When we were seated all the waiters were round the back and then they all stormed out leaving only 3 people left in the restraunt. Who had to serve the rest of the customers by them selves. After 10mins they finally came back and they didn't look happy.

Although the bar tender who stayed seemed to be very happy and the customers seemed pleased with his service.

When the food finally came my pasta dish took 10mins longer then the rest of the dishes served.

Having said all this the food was fantastic and very filling.

EDIT: I would contact however were flying back to England< /text>

Getting worse! I’m a “regular” I live really close by. I used to go every Tuesday night after work but seems like they just choose to keep customers away. They technically slapped the door on my face at 11:29 pm (when they “normally” close at 12)
Not a place to go no more</review>

The food now is almost comparable to Denny's In fact the only difference between the 2 it's the applebee's has a full bar but the service sucks I'm in they have TV's but food   Is really not great at all their service is very slow most people tend to ignore you  Do you sleep have to Chase down your server for food drinks or 2 just paid the bill at it seems like every time I go there I get charged $2 for the little computer on my table even if I don't touch it not sure that's how they make their extra little cash but they always have a charge on it for it I usually make   Them take it out I guess it's OK for drinks and appetizers for happy hour but that's about itThey do have an OK Margarita perfect Margarita deal</Text>

We 💟 Applebee's. My kid and I's go to place when the man is doing his thang. Good menu .. satisfying even to the most pickiest of eaters.  Curbside pick up .. in a rush .. order on the tablet at the table.</text>

The cutlery was dirty, the shrimp tasted expired, waitress was abrasive and not attentive. I had to ask for water for 4 times. Food was cold. Machine to play games , was broken. Waitress sat at another table with customers  and had a conversation while we waited to pay the bill. Waitress brought a hot chocolate that was over flowing and spilling and placed it in front of my son and just kept walking by as I was cleaning it up. Horrible experience, couldn't wait to leave!!!</review>

Our waitress sunni not only gave me a drink that was dirty but was snotty and rude. She hardly came by our table to ask for anything. By far the worst experience I've ever had.<//Text>

I placed an order online first off it was 15 minutes longer for my order to be ready than the time said, nobody even came to tell me it was going to take longer, then I get home and I have no dressing for my salad I asked for extra ranch and got none and my shrimp came with no sauce.< /text>
