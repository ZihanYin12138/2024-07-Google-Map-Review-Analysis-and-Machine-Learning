Gia freaking rocks! I went there with a general style and she worked with me to get to the exact look I was going for! She is a wonderful barber and such a personable human being! Thanks for your excellent work!< /Review>

The owner did it again....made my hair look wonderful! She added hair extensions on the sides to make my hair look more balanced and fuller! The extensions are unnoticeable and blend perfectly. I'm grateful</text>

I've been getting a lot of compliments on it too! i had super long hair, almost down to my lower back and she did such a fantastic job! she kept my natural curly texture intact and gave me lots of layers so it framed my face well. i had a great experience and i'll definitely be going back! also the other staff at the salon was very kind and they're respectful of their customer's pronouns etc, which was lovely to see :)< /review>

Angela did such an amazing job on my color. My hair has always been damaged so I was scared to go lighter, but she did it! Hair feels good and color is exactly what I wanted. She takes her time and is very knowledgeable on after care. Thanks!< /Review>

First haircut since Covid started and it was an extremely positive experience. Great haircut, the salon was airy with lots of space, and they were being conscientious about Covid precautions without being off-putting.<//review>

<review>If I could give Samantha 10 stars I would. She was so amazing. I came in today to get my hair done for my wedding. Not only did she exceed my expectations she was awesome. On top of that the place is clean and everyone is so friendly. Being that I’m new to the area this will definitely be my new salon.< /review>< pics>

I went to get my hair cut , bangs , layers. Simple? I got no layers to my hair my bangs were cut crooked. I went back to get it fixed but I just mostly got more of a trim. And to fix my bangs they just did a comb over and cut them and hid my bangs, so on a windy day u can see my messed up bangs. They staff was nice but they just couldn't get my hair right. Payed $45 to get a basic cut. I wish salons would just simply say they can't give you what you want or just charge extra. Needless to say I won't be back.<//Review>

<Text>This review is regarding Heather Gorbea, an employee of Salon Cheval.

Because of the Google review process, I have had to give a one star rating. This is a much higher rating than Heather deserves to receive. I would prefer to give a zero star rating, or even a negative rating, and my reasoning for this I will explain below.

I made the regrettable decision to see Heather as a client. To put it frankly, she messed up my hair. I had to go back to her multiple times in a futile effort to attempt to fix the mistake that had become my hair. I say attempt because, despite multiple visits back, trying to have the errors corrected, she only ever made it worse.

I had to pay for this. I even tipped 20%, every time until I stopped seeing her, and was understanding throughout the process. I finally walked away when her incompetence was too clear to see past, and she was coming up far short of being a kind and respectful person, as I had always been to her.

During each and every interaction with this person, I was polite and patient, despite the frustration and humiliation I felt at having my hair butchered repeatedly. She promised to make it right, and I believed her. I regret that now.

When it was clear to both of us that she did not have the adequate skills to properly style my hair, she offered a recommendation to another stylist whom she said she believed would be able to do better.

I waited for weeks, over a month, and heard nothing. Every time I asked, she promised to get back to me and never did unless I contacted her again. And each time this exchange took place, nothing would ever come of it; for some reason beyond my comprehension, she would never give me the stylist's reccomedation. Eventually she said that she'd called the individual and couldn't get an answer, several times, before saying that she finally talked to them, and they said they couldn't do it.

I don't know why she would seemingly intentionally ignore me, or refuse to give me the (public, not private) business information to the stylist that she mentioned and recommended. I felt like I was being stringed along and toyed with, at the end of which she disappeared from contact. I probably will never know the reason behind her behavior, but it was troubling and, honestly, saddening to me. I had always treated her with kindness and respect, been polite and tipped well.

Despite her obvious incompetence, I do understand the inability to prefer a task. Nobody can do everything, though she assured me beforehand she'd be able to, and that it wouldn't be a problem. In the end, while I am bothered by her promoting and confirming a nonexistent ability and skill set, I am more bothered by her actions. I am deeply regretful of having ever gone to her.

Had it not been for being treated so poorly, I probably would never have left any review, let alone one that goes into such detail. However, I want to make sure that no one goes through what I was put through, if I can help it, and give some warning to prospective clients.

Trusting this person was a terrible mistake on my part. I think for most people, it can be very embarrassing to be seen in public with a bad haircut, especially if it has been mutilated too short to be fixed right away, leaving the person with no recourse but to suffer through the humiliation day to day until it's long enough to fix. Between repeated butchering trying to fix it, paying for said mistakes monetarily and emotionally, and having my trust betrayed, I felt that I needed to issue a warning. I don't want anyone to go through what I did.

If you care about the service you're paying for and how you're being treated, beware of Hearther Gorbea.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d39b4054c78d:0x12ecbd596f931bfd</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

A male hairdresser, was very rough with my hair, had a bad attitude and complained on the fact that I was paying with a card. Apparently a fee was coming out of his pocket.<//review>

This Asian-French fusion restaurant is one I’ve been wanting to come to for years and it was worth the wait! Amazing service. Still closed indoors but they made a cozy out door area with live music. I went on a Thursday. Fun area to be in overall. We order the soup that was Devine. The catfish was perfect with a little squeeze of like and we got 2 sides. Veggies and stir fried rice. I was in food heaven! There servings are all shareable sizes if you like to share with someone on a date. Perfect spot for a cute date. LARGE wine selection and cocktails were yummy.<//Review>

What an amazing first post-pandemic dining experience! The DineLA menu provided a great sampling with enough to take home. Service was great, even while dining out on the sidewalk.

Thank you for making the end of the pandemic a true celebration Wolfgang Puck and team! The entire experience, down to the friendly other guests in the patio like PorkChopra (featured) were amazing.< /Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>Middle Eastern/Armenian food can be so hit or miss. It can be a challenge to get things just right, particularly when the joint is jumping and the patrons are getting restless. That said, Seasoning Alley does shawarma right, with just the right amount of seasoning (ha!) and wonderful side dishes.

I had a late lunch here on Saturday. The Chicken Shawarma plate was very nice, with delicious hummus and a nice salad to go along with the generous serving of chicken. I don't eat much rice, so the gracious and lovely hostess, Gohar, offered Mutabbal as an alternative. Absolutely delicious!

The Alley has two locations, which I totally understand. The good places in the LA area tend to spread their wings (eg: Guisados) and pop up in new places to put a smile on the faces of new diners!<//Text><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Went to this store a few times and they only sell authentic products, great customer service and Tracy (I think she is one of the owners) is very helpful and knowledgeable. She does not push you to buy stuff but will answer all your questions patiently.</Text>

<text>The best restaurant in Santa Monica.  Family style dining with a beautifully crafted menu. The fried catfish is delicious and I order it every time.  The sashimi,  oysters,  and braised short ribs are must haves.  The curry lobster is perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth.  Sides of vegetable fried rice and crispy spinach compliment any main dish. The staff is courteous and efficient. I've been going here for years and have never had a bad meal or leftovers. It's not cheap $$$$ but worth every penny.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bad3b5e28ee1:0xa9c91b41350944a6< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I believe it is because everyone that works there truly loves working there.
This is a historic place because Wolfgang Puck invented fusion cooking here but also because EVERY TIME YOU GO you will experience WORLD CLASS SERVICE and enjoy unbelievably delicious food.<//Text>< Pictures>

I was pleasantly surprised by how good both the food and price was! Not going to lie we had to wait an hour on a Thursday night to be seated, but that tells you how good it is! Loved everything that I tried, especially the mongolian beef. I would say thats a must try. I also really liked the fried wonton strips they bring to your table for free! It was addicting! Would definitely come back with my family< /Review>

I remember this restaurant being better in the past.  Our service tonight was disappointing.  Sitting at the counter with a view of the open kitchen was nice, but we felt neglected.  Nobody came to refill our water, and my wife asking for more water only resulted in a full glass for her, even though mine was empty.  A runner offered my son a bowl of rice but never brought it.  My cup of coffee was small, barely hot, and under-filled.  Nobody asked if I wanted more when the cup was empty.  I expect more when the bill approaches $100 per person.<//text>

Fabulous and unusual food, especially the out-of- this-world short ribs, soft shell crab, bass, and roast duck.  There is something for everyone on this menu, and at prices that are a bargain for food this good.  I couldn't help congratulating the chefs afterward for a job well done.  This is the only L.A. restaurant we've been to in a long time that equals what I'd expect from a top NYC restaurant.< /review>

Best restaurant in L. A.  Food exquisite.  Service attentive and professional.  Look for the small yin-yang icons on the menu.  These represent signature dishes from the original menu over 30 years ago.  Still mind-boggling after all these years.</Text>

Amazing food in a pretty nice place. Being able to see the kitchen is definitely a plus. Mind the air conditioning, sometimes you get pretty strong currents but all in all very enjoyable.< /Review>

I recommend the chicken salad. Although everything was delicious including the salmon with cold noodle salad and the stir fry vegetables. The portions are large, definitely share.< /Text>

Many happy occasions have been spent in this beautiful restaurant. The food is nothing other than excellent.  The menu is comprehensive and covers vegetarian and meat lovers’ choices. We ordered the special softshell crabs and various items on the menu that included tuna tataki, Szechuan pancakes,  seared Maine scallops, Shanghai lobster, whole sizzling catfish and the grilled Szechuan beef, for dessert we shared a variety of menu items.
We had the pleasure of being served by Lisa, who is an exceptional server.  She offered suggestions, plated the dinner and  carefully timed the meal, so that we could enjoy each dish one at a time.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted with great hospitality. We also had the pleasure of meeting the wonderful Bella Lantsman, who has been an integral part of the Wolfgang Puck organization, in particular Chinois, for many years. We look forward to many more happy occasions there.</Text>< pictures>

I've been coming here regularly since the late 1980s. By far my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. I live 40 minutes away but it's worth the drive. The Shanghai Lobster is to die for, and the duck pancakes are exquisite. The Szechuan beef is also superb. This is Wolfgang Puck's oldest surviving restaurant, and for a good reason -- it's his best! Highly recommended.</review>

Great food, consistently so.  Have never had anything less than a great meal there.  On occasion the table turn is slow and we have had to wait past our reservation time, but they have given us a glass of wine to compensate (which to us is the mark of a great restaurant, not that problems don't occur, but always apologize and do something to make it right).  Love the moo shu pork belly appetizer, the Kurbuto pork shoulder, among many other dishes.  Only criticism is that the restaurant itself could use some updating.  One of our favorites.< /review>

Be prepared to spend a lot and ignore the fact that this is part of the Wolfgang Puck empire. The food was really, really good and the service was top-notch.   The portions were also very large so it would actually be pretty easy just to split an appetizer and a side if you want to do this one on-the-cheaper side as well.<//review>

The service here was spectacular! They took great care of our every wish and did a wonderful job familiarizing us with the menu and specialties. I highly recommend the Spicy Szechuan Beef and the Haricot Vert is unbelievable. Vegetable fried rice and lime meringue were both solid additions to round out the meal. The only dish that was only OK was the Tempura Ahi Tuna rolls, definitely not worth the price.< /Review>

The food lacked real flavour across nearly all dishes.  Four for dinner and everyone felt it was dull - it was a Monday night maybe the reserve team were cooking.  Having enjoyed eating here a few times several years ago, a real disappointment.<//Review>

Overpriced and underwhelming - two words I wish I didn't have to use to describe a restaurant! This is one of Wolfgang's oldest eateries, and it shows with its dated decor and lack of care in serving up food worthy of the exorbitant prices. The service is attentive, however.<//review>

I miss Litchfield Toys! Remember cruising in there and getting a cool looking model of a butterscotch-colored Mercedes Benz from, like, 1974? Yeah. Welp. Those days are gone I guess. Ah Litchfield Toys! I miss them!</Text>

I used to visit them quite often in the last 20 years, then stopped for a while. I am not sure if it is a new management or what, but this shop has totally transformed 180*. It went from dusty yucky clutter to organized, clean, and helpful employees! Good job!</text>

I asked for a product and they recommended the wrong item for my sisters gift it was not at all what i asked for so I do not again suggest this place unless you yourself are familiar with All beauty products.

Special brands and products  don't get shelf space in chain stores. Thank goodness there are still stores that carry hard to find and imported beauty products.

Glenpro has extensive hair coloring selections, makeup, skincare, hair shampoo/conditioner/styling, accessories like combs and brushes.

It's several steps above Sally's in product selection and range.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I went to this store for the first time to buy Wella hair dye and pleasant surprise, the prices are very cheap compared to other beauty supplies and even Amazon.
The place is spacious, you can keep your distance from other customers and the ladies who attend are very friendly and helped me find what I needed.
It will definitely be my beauty supply store from now on. ♡

El lugar es amplio, puedes mantener distancia con otros clientes y las señoritas que atienden son muy amables y me ayudaron a buscar lo que necesitaba.
Definitivamente será mi tienda de productos de belleza en adelante. ♡<//Text><UserId.>102059217466800590259</UserId.><Name>Mage Masi</Name><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

We got lucky and didn't encounter huge crowds, tho I can image this hike gets a lot of traffic.  It's shaded, lush, gentle at the start with a nice climb down to the waterfall and back- nothing too hard so good for all ages - although some parts of it are narrow with a steep drop. Hubby went swimming in the pool under the waterfall- too cold for me!<//review>

I really enjoy this magnificent trail. It was a short moderate hike. On your way to the waterfall it's easy however on your way back you'll encounter a few inclines. Other than that a beautiful trail. The best views of the Angeles Forest mountains</Text>

Absolutely amazing views, trails, people to meet, etc. Loved the hike out there as much if not more than seeing the falls!</review>

<review>When I went, it was a bit busy. I arrived around 7:05am and the gates were closed to the trail entrance parking area, or picnic  area, it just closed for the cars,  so  I had to park at the parking spots by the road and walked down to the tail entrance, which is around the picnic area,

If you see the sign “Switzer Picnic Area”, there is a pathway that takes you down to the trail entrance.
Also you will walk next to the creek no against the  creek, however you will cross the river and you will face (2)trails  I will recommend the top trail, if you're a beginning hiker, is so much easier eventhough have some inclination but you wil be able to do it. , but if you desire to take down trail  becareful you will have to climb a rocks ddownhill.
If You took top trail After 2.5 miles you will have to take downhill you will see a sign that said falls, follow the sign and you will face the waterfall so you will walk against the the creek.
Note : Important  you can go back the way you get in there or you can go back by hiking by the top of the of the waterfall but is so hard you will have to climb a rocks uphill, there is water on the rocks I will no recommend.

The trail is primarily used for hiking and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.

The way down isn’t too bad.  I did 5 miles , Returning was more strenuous than going to the falls.. The waterfall was beautiful and the trail was mostly shady and cool breeze made our hike more enjoyable.

smooth walk it’s just only the way back that there’s inclinationat the end.  River crossing but there big enough rocks to make it through just fine! Enjoy!  PLEASE KEEP IT  CLEAN THIS TRAIL , PLEASE DON'T SIGH YOUR STUPI NAME ON IT ROCKS , NO GRAFFITI PLEASE</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLmNs_Sol-a21kttSUDwsGGxyvBeMJVaziwyh6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSpI20jN0FVGSqpT7sj3Ac7zBH-MFnBxb8T4Rb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAB_NDadKGHLmxDYPuMaKTTmVM3Ba5IkgkGszp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM85yJxJBZce3jX99n4BYrOzRqiRbGyMKTN0KvL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUciu964QII5w_1CMnqJt3RI__5graRW0C695V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSvebYrxOlRHhcDWTaFfgGQBsb9ecD8E5NgkGn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw6EKvg7X68NZZLRNUYEWQBH5z7MVzSz9PjDcv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMR9TK30_izXG5CY89gFLOHoFYaa-leWN4IIit2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYkqt5GsReBYvXoXNTeL7-h-lKnNRj17m0KlNG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzUUj2-aR1S1xzzD4k1rr4Cb-sRcJzMIoe0GBe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8OBUPexRgKHVY1HWHl4EUVordj-LEBL88oJII=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeYYYf3lljudbAX8Em5-sY5mcNnwVi57oA99w1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNof5jptBFd5BawiP9tI8ZnLXBnaNoi4PWmYUMI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_JOZGkgu9gGc80Ab8gPLr7Y4TWT5HrwOV2hQg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjl9I8hFDDfzKScV24Xv-zBJiwPBYf5yXZhh4B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

<text>It has something for everyone !
First part of the trail is easy but as you start going up, you go up for a while and then down on a busy and narrow trail till you get to waterfalls.

Many people with 🐕  and seen many without a leash. Is a trail for all ages.
Beautiful place.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><Date>1614554859094< /Date>< Pics>

<Review>Great hike to the falls. Both lower parking lots are unaccessible so you need to walk down and ultimately back up. 😢 Super views! Dress in layers since you don't get sun in the canyon. The wind chill really gets you. Many clean bathrooms (open). Tons of benches and BBQ grills (closed at moment). Don't forget your Adventure Pass.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2e8f8d10a3f4d:0xa757afeacbf2c2d9<//gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< username>

<review>We went on a Trail to Switzer Falls during February. The experience was very good. The weather was cool during this time of the year and the trek was also good owing to the numerous streams we had to cross to reach the falls. There is a well defined path for the Trail which makes it easier to reach the falls.
To park the car near the starting point, you need to collect a Parking permit which is available at a Shell gas station before the upway road starts.< /review>< rate>

This is by far one of my favorite places to hike!  I love the trail that is 75% covered in shade by the surrounding trees and the sound of the rivers that are close by throughout the hike is so calming.   This trail is fun to bring kids along and also I have seen dogs along the trail enjoying splashing water to cool off while hiking.  There are bathrooms next to the parking located at the bottom next to the starting point.< /Text>

The trail to Switzer fall for most part is easy. Lots of water crossing and rock hopping back and forth. At about 1 mile in before you begin the the incline, you can follow the stream to get a view of the top of Switzer fall. Turn around and go back up the trail. Once you get to the top and start your decent down the trail to the fall, more stream crossing and rock hopping. you will see your first fall. This is where most people stop have snack take pictures.  But it's not Switzer fall. If you are adventures you can clime the right side of the fall and keep going up stream for about 5 minutes hike and you will be at Switzer fall.< /review>

It’s a well maintained beautiful trail! Not so much elevation, perfect for beginners! The true falls, however, is not the first one most people stop—you can find the taller one further down. A bit rock climbing, but not too far from the first one! Very refreshing!< /Text>

The beginning of the trails was nice, lots of rocks. It starts to get a little narrow after you go up a hill. Only one person can walk by. It can be scary if you don’t like heights but it was worth seeing the falls. Going back to the entrance was easier until you have to go up that hill. I was literally dying. That was work out of a lifetime. 😂😂</text>

Nice, easy 5 mile hike. Carry extra pair of clothes if you wish to go into waterfalls. Be ready for some rock hopping. You will do that atleast 10 times during round trip<//review>

This is a nice, easy hike to the falls. Plenty of water crossings to test how quickly socks/shoes dry.</review>

<text>Excellent easy trail to a small waterfall.  The hike follows the creek and then climbs up the side of the mountain for a bit before descending to the waterfall.  Most of the trail is nicely shaded with lots of vegetation.  Several water crossings depending on how much rain there is.  Get there early for parking down by the picnic area.  Pit toilets at the picnic area.</text>< Resp>

<text>Although it's small it's a big waterfall in LA county already. The water is super big in winter and beginning of spring. It’s challenging even to cross the river at that time. In the beginning of winter, the water is almost dead.

This place is amazing. Be ready to get wet! Due to the rainy season there is absolutely no way to get to the waterfall without getting wet. There is also some ice on the trail so be extremely careful. Other than that it's a beautiful hike with amazing views.< /review>

<Text>A pleasant, cool hike down a shaded canyon to a small waterfall. Start at the Switzer Picnic area accessible by Hwy 2 and head down the canyon. This trail also provides access to Bear Canyon and a campsite within Bear Canyon.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>the hike to the falls is not too strenuous - the hardest part is towards the end of the trail when you have to climb an incline and him down to the falls and coming back. the falls itself is not too big but still a refreshing and cool spot to rest.</Review>< Pictures>

Quick drive up here to take the family for some outdoors. There is a trail that leads all the way down to JPL, and is a really good hike. There is water at the station near JPL, so I suggest hiking from Switzer down, then refill on water and hike back instead of the reverse.< /Text>

<text>Great place for a moderate to easy hike follow down stream to the top of larger waterfall, then turn right up hill trail at some point your 15 stories above the river, keep going till u hit the stream turn left arrive at double waterfall with large pool, keep going over falls to arrive at bottom of large waterfall that u first saw coming in, my fav place for 30 yrs, took fam n friends they all love it, please wait for some rain so the falls can flow n fill the 3 pools< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) Go to the intersection of the first waterfall and the second waterfall, there is no sign.
The water in this stream is not suitable for drinking, and washing hands can hurt your hands.
I have passed the stream many times along the road, and the scenery is beautiful.
3.5km one way

前往第一個瀑布與第二個瀑布的叉路口, 沒有標示.

沿路過溪很多次, 風景很美.

<Review>Shady, corrupt preorder system for new consoles. Was told lies about preordering when I put down deposit. Then told lies that they weren’t getting a second wave when Microsoft did send out another wave and then they changed stance and said they were probably only online and my preorder deposit wasn’t a preorder. Left the store extremely upset<//Review>< pictures>

Called about going to the store tomorrow for preordering the series x. They told me dont bother coming in all there consoles are already spoken for. I said how preorders don’t go up until tomorrow. They have been taking people’s money for preorders for months to hold them spot for one. Shady back door business.< /text>

Went to trade in some games and other equipment. As usual and can always be expected. I hear a great number only to have it cut in half or worse when I state that I don't want store credit... But on the bright side, they're always buying....</Text>

Neat little store. Cool people work there, definitely helped me pick out a new Xbox One when my PS3 finally broke. They answered all of my questions, there was a young guy there who was really helpful. Love gamestop, great store with affordable prices on used and new stuff.</text>

<Text>Sometimes you get good service other times you don't. I didn't have a bad experience until the last 6 mths or so. Now I don't want to go in there. Very rude and had friends hanging out and being very arupt and loud. Not sure if that person or those still work there and don't have their names but I don't go there unless I have to now.<//Text><username>Steffi Ahart<//username><rate>2<//rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1526059385406< /time>< userid>

Initially was told it was ghetto, and I believed it for a while. In a actuality it's a good environment, and the service is amazing. Bring a friend or two. Enjoy yourself.</Review>

What can I tell you it's a dive bar. When I can tell you is that the drink seemed to reasonably done in price and the bathroom was clean and orderly.</review>

It's very compact. The drink prices are decent and not over priced. There's just a small dancing area . I feel like this is more of a local biker bar. They also have an ATM if you need one, and there's a pool table, and clean bathrooms.</text>

I've been a patron there for over 10 years I know the owner she is very nice and respectful and fun and the Funky Monkey is a fun place and you want to see your sports there is over 20 different screens to watch your favorite sports where can you go wrong you can't .
There are two pool tables Other Bar games if you're in town stop by it's a very nice place on Main Street downtown Hayward California< /review>

<text>Best place in Hayward the owner.always glad.you came I enjoy thur-sat dj music dance to hip-hop &rap no racial issues all get along too bad the girls don't join you dancing seems like because I'm older girls don't try to be friendly too bad i encountered freaqent  customer load rude & aggressive using choice words he picked from the garbage warning another reg customer smoking  less than 25feet from the entrance I will mention to the owner to warn this customer not to threaten  people  about rules in such an aggressive  manner after I tried respectful in my approach to speak to him he said he has known the owner and previous place they owned hint uncle Rs& JoJo so he didn't  care my words so thru his aggressive load hot temper told him my number of yrs as a customer was equal  if.not longer than his so that's not the issue in this instance  his presence  and right to speak for this place only he was allowed  to speak about  so the owner should be able to handle his better then everyone thinking his pile don't stink looking to see his expression and opinion about that I think he might be swallowing a lot of his ignorance anyway editor the 1 the only gentleman peaceful humble and respectfully RaiderDave thank you for caring about your customers specially not with us anymore like my favorite George inventor of the Stockton slammer was a unique  good soul he was my friend in my prayers Salute!!!!

It's the monkey... You know what you're getting. The bartended are super social and a heavy pour. Very affordable, but not the greatest whiskey selection.</text>

I was visitin from Atlanta and had few bars that i planned to check but never left the monkey. Service was great, prices reasonable, very friendly crowd and they even have a patio where you can bring your drink to smoke. I personally recomend this place if you are visiting like myself.</text>

Ok atmosphere. I visited on a Monday night.. As a waitresses, i will not be returning to this establishment. The Bartender, female, didnt catch her name, was playing with someone elses phone and ignoring me while i waited to order a second drink. When it came time to check out she repeated the tip amount i would like to leave but over charged my card and seemed to be upset when i asked for a correction.< /text>

<Review>Most items were not available because apparently they start shutting down the fryers and whatever else they use to make the food 45 minutes before they actually close! I was told I would have to wait over 20 minutes if I wanted fries and chicken because they only had one working fryer. Not to impressed but the popcorn chicken I got was good so no complaints about the food.< /Review>< time>

<Review>Went through drive thru and was told to wait in the front for my order. There were 20 cars  waiting for their foods in the front. Employee told me because they wanted their drive thru time down so that’s why they made everyone waited in front for their foods. I waited 2 hour just to get my chicken combo meal. This is Ridiculous and worst KFC ever been to. Every customers was angry and mad. Why would it takes 2 hours to get one combo meal?????< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Owner is trying to save money I guess because the front counters lights are off. For a second I thought they might be close but then there's  a few people inside. There was NO staff available in the front counter to take our order. We were third in line Waited maybe 5 minutes for a staff to appear on a weekday lunchtime. There was one staff member doing the drive thru and another one in the kitchen. Maybe hire more staff members or schedule people properly? They really need more staff because the dining area was dirty, the trash can was full, the soda area was messy.
Overall poor management.
Food was fine. came out on time.
We ordered a root beer float and we were dining in but I wonder why it wasn't served on the chilled mug as traditional.</Text>< Response>

<Review>The guy working the drive thru right now is a detriment to the business. Wouldn’t allow me to add Nashville hot sauce to the chili cheese fries, because, “there’s no way to charge for it.” (And I asked very nicely) Then don’t charge for it genius, and you might gain a loyal customer. I’ll just eat somewhere else thank you<//Review>< Pics>

The manager, Manuel, is a great guy. I got all the way home and noticed that my sides were missing. I called up the store and Manuel made it right. I was able to go back and pick up the sides without a problem. I should have checked he order before leaving in the first place. 4 stars though because it was partly their fault.<//Text>

They always get the wrong orders and mix everyone’s meals up! They need to upgrade a better staff and the manager needs more work in training the team next time I will reach out to cooprate if they mess my order for third time!< /Text>

<Text>Ordered a famous bowl and received no chicken in it. I was not told prior if there was a shortage of chicken or anything like that. If I pay for something I expect to get the full product, I will be taking my business elsewhere.

Dirty. Windows haven't been washed in months. Some have complained about slow service but today they were really fast. It was 12:15 on a weekday and only one other customer in restaurant. Should have had the time to make this place spotless. There's a reason people don't come here.</Review>

Took forever to get our food, service sucked and the crew was very lazy. The place was a wreck and everyone was standing around talking. This place needs much better MANAGMENT!!! Even the managers office looked like a pigsty from counter view. The only thing good about this place was the popcorn chicken bowl..< /Text>

<text>This store needs a good cleaning, it is super filthy! Floors, countertops and tables are sticky with trash all over. Fountain drinks taste terrible. It took 18 minutes to get our food when we were dining in and I only received it because I was standing at the register waiting for an employee. Looked like the manager had a nice warm meal that she took into her office though. I will not visit this location again.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Worst experience ever, they were not open on time, when they finally were open nothing was prepared. From the food to payment process. Very upset.
Went through drive thru took them more than 30 mins to even give me any sort of food.. will not be returning to this KFC again. If I could give no stars I would.
Need more organization skills, need to set up earlier.
Clearly are on there own time.
Cars were even reversing back out because the long wait time. RIDICULOUS
And to top it off my order was completely wrong<//Review>

This place really really needs to be cleaned!!! My shoes stick to the floor and you couldn't touch anything. It was bad. Yuk and spills every where. I understand it was the end of the day. However, you could see the yuk on the counter tops. I've frequented this place for years and have recently noticed a decline in care. I will take my business to the other kfc. Please fix this as it is closer to my home.< /text>

100%!! the worst resturant I have ever been too, they never have anything!!!
no chicken or no biscuits, no root beer or something. I have never been there when they could fill a complete order, I don't know who owns this dump or who he has running it but I would never send anyone there nor will I ever go back!! if you want good chicken go to the KFC on Golden state where they always have everything!!
PS the only reason I am giving this DUMP a star is because it won't let me post with out it.<//Text>

The food is good, just do not like the wait that you have to go through when they are not really that busy. Waited in the line for over 40 min from beginning too picking up food. As much as I like them, the night shift does not know how to time their food and orders. I wont be going there very often if at all again!</text>

2.5 hours before closing and not enough chicken, burners were down wait over 20 minutes for burner to reach a certain temperature and than cook chicken.  They like to preclose really early.  This happened at 3 hour before closing, what's up owner.</text>

This location has really gone down hill. Our last visit is probably our last. Took over 10 minutes for someone to take our order. The woman at the register was also putting all the orders together. The restaurant is also filthy with flies everywhere. It also took a long time to get our order. The restaurant was not overly busy at< /Text>

<rating>2</rating><Text>Not that great. 1st we had to wait about 15 minutes in the drive thru just to order. 2nd The manager says another 8 minutes before chicken is done, ok it nearly 8pm-after the dinner rush time. 3rd another 15 minutes till we get to the window. The clerk says "sorry manager didn't tell you, we're out of root beer. Out root beer machine has been down for a while now." Of course she tells us after we've already paid. Another 20 minutes to get there order. If there weren't people behind and in front we would have left. We were stuck for the duration.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I tried to go through the drive through last night some girl told me to please wait a minute and then didnt come back for 15 minutes.I hought I was on some sort of hidden camera tv show seriously crazy. She came back asked to take my order,
I ordered a kids meal with chiclen nuggets and then asked her how many sides there were.There was no response, None!!!!! Iasked again and same thing. I thought maybe the intercom was broken and drove to the window only to find a rude girl briefly saw me then turned her back to me and walked away. I couldnt believe it! Sat for another couple minutes then honked and ahe ignored me. I wasted almost 30 minutes of my time and then left with a crying child in my car. Ive never been so angry. This was so wrong. She should be fired and i will NEVER go there again.< /Review>

For the second time they messed up a 40 dollar order. Out of 4 meals only 1 was right. Got the wrong chicken. Wrong sauce on the tenders. Even the drinks were wrong. Had to drive back across town to get it fixed. Staff is rude. The manager was polite but the rest of the staff looked irritated that they had to fix their mistake</review>

<username>Karen Matthews</username><date>1385496730850<//date><rate>2< /rate><review>I think it's terrible when you have to call KFC to place an order because they never have any chicken ready due to not enough business. You should always have some pieces available especially around lunch time where you don't have to sit and wait. Also when you place an order and request a boneless piece for $1 it specifically states on the advertisement that you can order a piece with each purchase. I purchased 2 separate orders so other individuals at my company could try a piece and they told me that they couldn't do that. The manager states its only one per customer, but your business is trying to make money. Hmmmmmm....something isn't being done right.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Always come back for more! El Rinconcito is our place to eat when my husband and I feel like eating out in town. The workers are great and the food is always delicious. Get the Steak and Shrimp ala Diabla it was excellent.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Looking for a decent place to eat in the little town of Gonzales on the way up Highway 101. This one caught my eye from the reviews which all seemed favorable.  We were greatly surprised to find out that it was even more than favorable. The food was excellent, the service was friendly and prompt, the prices were cheap! What more could anyone ask? Some favorites were the shrimp cocktail. That one is more like a gazpacho soup that is loaded with shrimp! Another was the super Chavela. Also well loaded with everything and then some.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Drove by on our way to LA and I must say it was DELICIOUS.  Oscar was there by himself and attended to many. Service was a little slower than expected but worth the extra 15 minute wait. Carne asada super burrito and campechana were AMAZING!<//text>

<review>This place has great service and great food. Whether you want breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the food will be delicious.

In the weekends, I like eating their Menudo. It is not greasy. The tripe is cut into small squares.

They serve foods for all types of weather. If it's hot, you can eat a shrimp cocktail. If it's cold, you can eat "Caldo de Pollo", "Siege Mares". This is a great place to be at. The waitresses are very helpful and polite.<//review>< Pics>

I have been eating at this restaurant since I was 14 years old. The food is very consistent, and the family that owns it really cares about the food they serve. Chile Verde, and Machaca are my favs, with a Chile Reyeno on the side. Camorones Diabla are very good as well,.
When we travel, We have shipped their food over night fed ex where ever we go.

Great spot for lunch or brunch. Every dish had great fresh ingredients and was plated beautifully.
Scallops were in a delicious mushroom sauce and were cooked well.
Pork belly was a bit too sweet but still yummy.
Lastly, Vuelve A La Vida, shrimp cocktail inside a pineapple was nice and refreshing.
Definitely coming back to try more dishes.</Review>

Came here randomly with a group of 6 following some hangout/walking the cliffs along the beach. Arrived right as they were opening and were warned by another passer-by that it was very small portions, but pricey; this was true. A small restaurant, only a few tables. We shared all the dishes, some of them were a bit too small to try and share between 6 people, so we each only had one bite of some of them, but had more of the paella and gnocchi to share. Flavors were superb and ingredients were really well combined in the different dishes, and visually interesting as well. I would absolutely go back for a taste-sensory treat and indulgence. Eat slowly, savor each bite.<//review>

I was shocked by how amazing this place was. Every dish was not just tasty and perfectly prepared, but was plated with such beautiful detail that I gasped each time I saw the waiter bring it out. We sat outside because I brought my dog and service was great, they continually came out to check up on us. Our favorite tapas were the grilled octopus and sautéed seafood in curry. Highly recommend and can't wait to return!</Review>

Legit Spanish tapas that are priced well for how much food they serve you, quite unlike all the overpriced and underwhelming tapas places in San Francisco. Shrimp in oil came out literally flaming hot and were perfectly cooked, if a bit on the salty side. Mussels were also cooked well in an excellent tomato broth. Patatas bravas were bigger than expected, but crisp and covered in tasty sauce. Overall good service, even if the food comes out slowly. Great spot to eat if you find yourself in Half Moon Bay!<//text>

Excellent food, really close to the beach, and the services was excellent. I was the only one there when I arrived, and the lady who was there was very kind to recommend me a bunch of plates. The one that I end up ordering, Frutos del Mar, was extremely yummy and full of flavor. The dessert was like a deconstructed guava cheese cake, it looked and taste delicious as well</review>

Wow! This restaurant is an outstanding secret in the Bay Area! Gambas and the garlic sauce is perfection. Mushroom ravioli is a mix of wild earthy mushrooms. All downed with a fantastic sangria tinto, with not just wine and fruit, but subtle herbs.

And the chocolate mousse is darling!

I wish I were hungrier! You will NOT be disappointed.< /Text>

<text>Very tasty food , beautifully and creatively presented. The place is small and cozy. They can get really busy during the peak hour. So the service is slow. But the waiters are very kind and nice.</text>< pictures>

<Review>I have gone to this restaurant a few times with friends for birthdays and we “Mmmm’d” our way through every course! Of course we tried the Paella and it was the Bomb. My friend said their wine was very good too! I look forward to going back once Covid lifts restrictions!< /Review>< Response>

Food was really good and simple. What really stood out was the awesome waiter we had. He was so nice! Actually everybody working there was friendly. It was very clean inside. This will definitely be a place I return. Well done Romesco!< /text>

I’m a local here on the coast and just discovered this gem of a restaurant today for lunch. True Spanish and a Cuban influence. I ordered the Pork Belly with Brussels Sprouts w bacon and carmarchel sauce.
It was so flavorful and tender. Menu changes frequently, homemade w love. Locally and seasonal ingredients. Fresh. I almost ordered the Cuban Pork sandwich. There are vegetarian meals. He used to be a chef at the Ritz in Miami. From Spain. Extensive Spanish wine. Tapas. Flavorful. Family wonderful. Affordable. A gem. No food like it on the coast or anywhere. I’ll go back frequently:</Text>

The best service. I had the shrimp and avocado and the fish tacos, the shrimp was bursting with flavor and it was served warm, I had the two fish tacos served in an individual taco dispenser, the fish was cooked to perfection and to compliment my food I had a hot tea. The place is impeccable clean with soft background music.< /text>

They just changed owner, so most of the pretty dishes you see in review are no longer available.
The service was excellent (2stars for that), but food is really hard to say, most of the dishes were not seasoned (or too hard to tell). I don't have much experience in Spanish cuisine, but they shouldnt taste all like "zero salt / weight loss diet". E.g. for $18 chicken fajita, u get blend dry chicken, uncooked vegetables, no seasoning sauce but another blend sour cream.<//Text>

Small restaurant with a one-page menu of delicious, complex small plates. Portions are generous and one or two tapas will feed most diners; the dinner plates are probably best shared.

Red sangria was excellent! The pork belly was a delicious sweet and savoury option. The curry seafood has a delicious sauce that you will want to finish up with some more bread ... But I'm not sure how you are supposed to eat those shrimp. :)<//Text>

I been here with my lady and ordered Tapas...I loved the restaurant, the owner was a cool and humble gentleman. He cooked everything, I didn't know that till he came and checked in on us at the end. The food is great, the owner is great as well. He even offered us free desert we really appreciate everything...They deserve nothing but the best, thank you for your hospitality!!!</Review>

Romesco Bistro and Tapas is a hidden gem. You might not notice it at first, since its location is confusing to reach. We were out past 9 pm and we were looking for some dinner. Unfortunately all restaurants in the area had closed, except for Romesco. We came in, greeted by a kind server. She helped us decide on good decisions because of my allergies. Every dish we had was very nice. From plating to taste, from entree to dessert, everything was delightful. I highly recommend you give Romesco Tapas and Bistro a try if you're into Spanish cuisine.<//Review>

<review>A friend and I went here for dinner around 6 on a Friday night during weekend. We were so lucky to make happy hour because we got a great deal on great food! We were able to get the sangria flight (highly recommend), usually they sell out of that. We also ordered an croquettes (which I greatly appreciated the fact there were four croquettes) and the house paella. Our server was attentive and really nice. I will definitely be coming back next. Also, not to forget, how cute the interior design was!!<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808f74b2ff7ccf77:0xb14c657677d5e6fc<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We needed to get extra bread because we didn't want to miss sopping up one ounce of that sauce!  Followed by mushroom ravioli, which is always a favorite.  But this one was OUTSTANDING!  It might sound weird, but was just divine...the ravioli was topped with cream sauce (as expected) and then cashews, blistered tomatoes, cooked greens, and whole mushrooms!  Finished with the chocolate mousse, which was encased in a huge chocolate ribbon.  Phenom!  Can't wait to come back and try their signature dish: paella!!<//Review>< Pics>

<text>🌙Half Moon Bay🌊 How sweet it must be to live near this EPIC little restaurant! 10 at night, all other eats in the area have rolled up the carpets accept the music still plays and the candles still burn at Romesco Bistro! The food, w😍w,,, a true culinary artist must be at play in their kitchen as my meal was fit for a king or Salvador Dali, so creative and delicious😋 Love and appreciation out to the Romesco Bistro, thank you so much for the beautiful meal🙏< /text>< pics>

<text>This is a wonderful restaurant! The atmosphere is awesome, and the food was incredible. My girlfriend loved the Paella, and I the heirloom tomato salad , which was the freshest salad I've ever had. Definitely get a Moscow mule and a few tapas, as they are small dishes and won't fill you up. Highly recommend the churros con chocolate dessert.<//text>< pictures>

<review>The fries were good, and they provided some decent olives while we were waiting.

The clam chowder was tasty but I found no clams (it did have some pieces of what appeared to be fish.)  Full of cream, but not a great deal at $10.

The Caesar salad was visually appealing, but not very tasty and strangely consisted of a couple of large pieces of non-chopped lettuce.

The paella was oily, overcooked (partially burnt and the rice very gummy).
The servers were polite, and prompt with everything.

Overall, a quite disappointing meal at $59 for dinner for 2, with no drinks or desert.</review><gmap_id>0x808f74b2ff7ccf77:0xb14c657677d5e6fc<//gmap_id>< Pics>

Very nice family owned Spanish restaurant South of downtown half moon bay. Small but good selection of Spanish white wines ( didn't try the refs). Tapas are delicious. If you are gluten free, be sure to let the server know sincere many of the tapas are served on bread. Has a pirch for outdoor dining when weather permits.< /review>

<Review>Came here with my family and friends. I had a wonderful experience eating at Romesco's. We had a bunch of tapas they were very tasty and good portions. Ignore all the ignorant reviews that they are only complaining about the prices being high. I believe this place is a lot cheaper than others tapas restaurant that I've been to. For example the paella 35 dollars for two people? That's 17.50 per person. I will be back for sure Oh, and the service was excellent also.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>Went to Romescos for dinner on Christmas Eve with my family (8 people). Wasn't really what we were expecting when we realized that they had a Christmas dinner special menu. Items seemed really highly priced considering it's a tapas-style restaurant. I'm used to Cascals in Mountain View where the items are small but the prices are pretty reasonable. Just to give you an idea they had a seafood paella for two and it cost $70. At the end of the evening, we racked up a $300 check and left the restaurant still pretty hungry. That was with no alcoholic beverages. While the food was good I was not impressed with the portion size to price ratio. I will keep my rating at 2 stars and update if I ever have a chance to sample the regular menu.

Overall service was good but we were the only party in the entire restaurant so that isn't saying much.<//review>< name>

Unfortunately, the owner sold the place and now is really bad.
We had paella and the rice was undercooked, cold and flavorless. We also had appetizers, patatas bravas and they were undercooked and cold.
I do not recommend this place at all. If you want to try real Spanish dishes please eat somewhere else.

This was my review two years ago

The food is amazing, the paella, meatballs, shrimps and everything else was really tasty. This is the first time in a long time that we tried paella that is really good. 100% recommended.<//review>< Pictures>

Ok it may not look like much and your Lyft driver may get confused getting there but it's a gem. Chef used to cook at Ritz in Miami and it shows - presentation is incredible and seafood is delicious. Good wine menu. They are relatively new in town and locals aren't aware of them yet, but this place is worth going to and could become a legend.<//Text>

< review>
We came here for lunch, I believe the service at lunch and at dinner are quite different.

Scallops: 5/5, absolutely amazing dish, worth the price of admission. I was really suprised at how good it was presented as well, you'd think its a $30 dish

Croquetas: 3/5 the croquetas themselves were good, but the romesco sauce was white, almost cheese like. Im really suprised by this considering its the name sake if the restaurant

Papas bravas: 5/5, really suprised with the presentation, tasted amazing

Ceviche: 4/5, great natural flavor that highlighted the fish well. The tostones that came with it were a bit chewy, but other very good

Service: 3/5, i tried to order a cortado, the woman serving me didn't know what this was, and asked if I meant a coffee we had a back and forth for a little biy before the young guy behind the counter overheard it all and made it. Maybe she wasn't Spanish, idk. She was also a bit pushy at the beginning, wanting us to order ASAP. Felt weird ordering before my GF was ready< /review>

Avoid all cost! it isn't worth the point 4.5 rating! 1. tapas are okay like other reviews, but black patella is too salty and highly overpriced for the quality. 2. Service is terrible, our waitress doesn't speak english well, he missed our order where we order 3 tapas at first we cancel 2 of 3 immediately after in order to exchange for black patella, but the waitress send us all items instead! We argue with he, but he said it on the table you have to pay for it. Avoid all cost!< /Text>

it is absolutely terrible place!
Firstly, they do not have rest rooms, for this you need to go far and uncomfortable :(
Secondly, they have a very cool iron chairs to sit on them it is necessary to put something warm :(
Third, the waiter - a young man -
not very well spoken in English and answered reluctantly questions :(
Finally, they have expensive and tasteless food:
for $ 80, we have brought a huge plate of ordinary rice stew with frozen vegetables and some boiled mussels :(
dish called paella
I repeat it was awful, especial in Thanksgiving Day :(< /review>

<review>[Update] Romesco has been taken over by new management, and it's no longer serving tapas. The food is now mediocre at best, and I can't recommend making out the trek to Half Moon Bay for this anymore. Really unfortunate that this restaurant is no longer around!!

[Old Review]
Amazing Spanish tapas restaurant -- highly recommended for groups so you can try a little bit of everything. The black paella was a pretty good deal considering it comes with tons of seafood including half a lobster and lots of shellfish, shrimp, and calamari. I also really liked the grilled octopus (or pulpo) as it was quite tender and tasty! The pork belly and the "Vuelve a la Vida" were also very delicious. The vuelve a la vida was a very interesting mango dip to go with plantain chips. The Croquettes De Jason Serrano were pretty straightforward croquettes but very well fried -- crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and not too oily. Keep in mind the Pan Con Tomàquet is essentially a Spanish ham and cheese sandwich, but it was still really good!

The sangria was surprisingly quite sweet, which made it seem like they added quite a bit of fruit juice. I liked that it was served with fruit and a cute little umbrella. Really spiced it up a notch.

Everything was excellent, and we left with our stomachs full and happy.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

They brought the black paella back, and it's an even larger dish then before. It definitely feeds two people, with barely another appetizer needed.

The Sangria is always delicious, they have red or white available and the red (my standard order) goes with everything on the menu. There is now a daily Tapas and daily croquette. They have come into their own, and feel more stable then last year. Their dishes and flatware have even been upgraded.

The highlight of my last visit, besides the black paella, was the flan. It was done perfectly.  Soft and silky in texture the way flan is suppose to be. I've tried it at all the Mexican restaurants on the coast and every one of them tastes like it's from a box, or is overcooked and curded. This was made the way a chef makes it, with care.

They are a welcome addition to the food options in HMB. They are also open later than 90% if the restaurants on the coast (between Pacifica and Pescadero), making them a perfect place to have dinner or a bite when 92 tourist traffic is at a standstill in the summer.< /Text>

Came last night with my husband and I had a  wonderful Dinner. The things I ordered were "Ceviche" it tasted really fresh the flavor were a combination of lime, cilantro, sweet coconut, and Ginger, It came with colorful tortilla chips and then the patatas bravas it's not you're average Spanish potatoes, they made it into cubes filled with the delicious sauces, We also has Paella Valenciana it was mouth watering, and its was 17.50 per person it's really cheap compared to other places that I've been too. Finally We had the Keylime Pie it's a good size for two people, it was decorated beautifully and you could taste the fresh lime in every bite. I would recommend this place to whoever is looking to try something new.< /Text>

Very nice family, great customer service.

Unfortunately food has nothing to do with real Spanish, it's good, but unfortunately not Spanish.< /review>

Delious but they were out of my husband's first 3 choices and the service was slow but friendly, so we hung in there and the food didn't disappoint.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Enjoy a delicious salt-sealed fish here. The fish is soft and tough, so it is delicious without the sauce.

<rating>1</rating><text>This place doesn’t answer the phone and if they do they put you on hold for thirty minutes. This isn’t my first time going here I’ve given this place numerous of chances even gave them another chance when they said they didn’t have time for my dog because it was the end of the day he was bleeding out due to a cut artery after a cat attacked him. I love Banfield but this one reflects poorly on them the one in Eastlake is much more professional.</text>< name>

So a few months ago I brought in my cat, he was having a lot of problems. For a NON emergency clinic, my total estimate came out to around 500 for some basic bloodwork and an ultrasound and they offer no payment plans even during the pandemic. Crazy. Ultimately they sent me away saying if I couldn’t pay for their tests plus then have him transferred to emergency care and pay those tests as well that my cat would not have a very good prognosis. I told them multiple times how much I could afford during Covid and they would go back take one thing off and come back with a quote still well over what I even had in my bank account. So My cat left with us not really knowing anything, yet she still prescribed him a prescription food from Hills Science Diet(even though I told her he was already on a urinary care food plan with his regular vet) and told me if I fed him anything else, even unapproved treats, I was pretty much damning my cat. I’ve read about this food and the ingredients and they are very bad but I figured a vet would know what she is talking about. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on this food trying to find a flavor my cat would eat, and he wouldn’t eat it. The cans smell like medicine to MY nose, I imagine to a cat it’s probably way worse. We tried feeding this food to 3 other cats in the house NONE of them would eat it. For a 15 pound cat it costs over $120 a month to feed my cat this food and none of the cats will even eat it! I’ve been trying to find just one flavor that any of them will eat and they won’t!!! Not to mention it is full of byproducts and fillers, it’s like medicated friskies for 5x the price! I look into it, turns out they get bonuses based off of their sales of hills science diet. Pretty gross. Anyway, two days later my cat was completely fine even though they made me sign a paper saying if I understood how serious my cats condition was and was refusing treatment, even though everyone knows if someone can afford to get their animal everything they need, they will. It’s just a scummy business, that preys on people looking for a low cost vet during a time ago struggle.</Review>

Good visit, Dr was very informative. The only thing is that when I made an appointment they called me back to confirm the appointment. If you miss the call they will cancel without your consent. Even if you have a plan and pay monthly, appointment or not.<//Review>

<response>None</response><review>I had multiple bad experiences here. Dont waste your money on the memebership. All they want is your loyalty and it is beyond not worth it. The staff are nice, but they are so disorganized and can't get it together. The worst experience I had was my poor kitten was hurt and I took her in to get checked. I dont make a lot of money and are on a super tight budget. I was first quoted $900 to save her life. I scrounged up barely enough money between me and family members to pay for it. Then to find out the next day (half way through the procedure) that the total was actually $1200. I had no choice but to take out another credit card just to pay the difference because they messed up my estimate. The vet and staff were very insensitive and didn't seem to care. All they wanted was my money. There were other instances that happened as well with lack of detail and poor management. I was so happy to be free of this place after my membership expired. Such a full waste of money for the membership.</review>< date>

I've hoped if another Banfield could have treated my dog since her ear hematoma had occurred after she had been misdiagnosed for diabetes by Banfield located on Main street. The doctor could not treat for her ear but instead pushing us to do unnecessary exams as usual. Unfortunately, this Banfield was the same as another one. We were told to go to a skin doctor or "specialist" by their recommendation and pushing unnecessary exams every time we visited there. They didn't want surgery for her ear. It's extremely hard to understand why they simply just drained the blood out of her ear which I could've done at home by myself. They've kept playing the expensive game and they could not identify what was wrong with my dog. These two Banfield altogether, this very frustrating procedure had been ongoing for at least 2 months. Now, you might wonder how come I'm sure to state that they did not do what they had to do? Because another vet we went for the second opinion was able to perform surgery and resolved her problem in a week. Useless insurance price has been increasing year by year, and the quality of service has been getting poor and poor. Definitely, I would not recommend Banfield, anyone, anymore.<//Review>

This is the first time I got my dog groomed at this location and they did a terrible job. My dog did not smell clean when I picked him up and his hair was not as soft as it usually is after grooming. I felt they didn't do a good job with the bathing because after petting  him, his hair felt dirty. I could tell he was not brushed properly as he still had curls in his butt area (the hair gets curly when it is wet and puffy after brushing). Before paying, I asked if his paw pads hair had been removed like I asked in the beginning and they said yes. After I  pay and get to my car I decide to check my dog's paw pads and the hair had not been removed. I did go back and they removed his paw pads hair but this will be the last time I book an appointment with grooming at this location.</Text>

Had to get prescription food for my cat, my vet was out of it so gave me a prescription that I could bring here until they get some in. The receptionist acted like they had nothing to do with the prescription food, so I went to check out and found  out I did need a card from them....so back to the receptionist I go. She gives me the card and attitude. Spells my name wrong on the card....keep in mind my name is written on the prescription....that's not a biggy but on top of the rest.....yup.....and when I commented on them to the PetSmart cashier (who was wonderful) she said "yeah I wouldn't bring my pets here"......big red flag</text>

<Review>Made the appt. to get my puppy shots and a health certifate.  When I got there the doctor tells me she is new and and is not qualified to give health certificate.  They said I need to make another appt. with another doctor and pay another visit fee for the health certificate.  1st visit to this vet and was not a good experience.  They could have given me a appt. with the doctor that provides health certificate and not the one that doesn't.  They also wanted me to sign up for the vet insurance which I refused because of this.  Now I have to look for a more professional honest vet.< /Review><Date>1530675506654<//Date><Resp>{'time': 1530989672477, 'text': 'Hello Frank, We’re sorry you were frustrated with your visit and would like the opportunity to learn more about what happened.

I've been going to vets with my own dogs for years and coming from a family of animal lovers vet appointments growing up was very common. Out of all the different vets I have been to this was by far my worst experience. They try to charge your for everything possible...I was a couple minutes late and the lady at the front desk was very rude. My boyfriend and I recently rescued a dog who got fix but her incision was infected and the first layer of stitches where ripped open from the people who originally cared for her. When they looked at it they pulled her incision further apart to the point where my dog was clearly in more pain. The bill and following appointments where to the point that it was unaffordable. The assisted to the doctor was also rather rude.... I wouldn't recommend this vet to anyone.< /Text>

Never take your pet here or any of their locations. They are scam artists.

Took my cat here for flea medicine and hair loss treatment.  They said they needed to give her shots she never got.  The male doctor did actually comfort my cat, unlike any of the women that work there. That's the 1 star. We let them take my cat behind closed doors to get the shots. Not sure why it needs to be done without you being able to watch.  Red flag right there.  So the cat came back into the initial room. They then told us we could pay over $700 to get all the work done and revolution flea medicine.  My gf and I didn't have that much.  We did however have a care credit card from our other cat we took to another banfield location. He supposedly had urinary stones. Cost us $1200 to get him better.  We've still been paying off his bill,  so we didn't quite have enough to pay for all of this cat's bill this time.  They sold us on insurance to get the bill down, just like they did with the other cat.  When we got to the counter to pay, we were told that if we used the care credit card we had to pay all the bill.  We wanted to pay half with the card and the rest in cash. I'm not sure how the woman working the counter got confused or if they get a cut from making you use the care credit card.  Anyways,  we found out we could pay half with card and the rest in cash.  She already had us sign papers before we knew the actual cost. The total cost changed from the doctor's room computer screen to the front counter, causing much confusion. If the total was what tgey told us in the doctors room, we'd have enough on the card to cover it. We waited for half an hour for the counter worker to call some company to cancel the first payment option, and then allow us to pay how we had originally asked in the beginning.  A waste of everyone's time,  plus just total confusion.<//review>

I loved it never felt more comfortable at a dentist office. Very nice and easy to talk to staff. Gaby helped me and she was amazing ! Dr.Lindsey was very professional and sounds very educated. Office is really up to date and very clean and cool looking. They also play very good music. 10 out of 10 recommend< /text>

I have been bringing my son Robert here for well over 3 years and now my daughter is getting her invisalign. and I have a few more that are going to need braces, but no fear or hesitation I know my kids will be well taken care of at Dr Specht's.  I am very happy with the work done, and the customer service. ALWAYS great people, awesome attitudes, professional, well put together. I can't ever complain. Staff is GREAT! Keep up the GREAT job ladies and gents.< /text>

<Text>Today was a good day! We came in today for a braces consultation for my 8 yr old daughter. They were thorough and friendly throughout the office. It turns out that my daughter still has some growing to do and she still has quite a few teeth that still need to come in before anything has to be done and I appreciate Dr. Spechts expertise and his wealth of knowledge. I trust him wholeheartedly with my baby’s smile and should she still need braces once all of her adult teeth grow in, she will be getting them at Central Coast Orthodontics!< /Text>< Resp>

Dr Specht is an AMAZING orthodontist. The staff is very friendly. The process was lengthy but super smooth considering the amount of work my son needed. The end result and boost of confidence in my son's smile was worth every penny. The office offers payment plans so that helped make the procedures affordable. We always enjoyed the ice bar after his visits. Overall a great experience!!!</text>

I wasn't satisfied today. I was trying to make it to my daughters appointment and was running a lil late.  Called to let them know that I was on my way. Spoke to Nallely which wasn't much help. She told me that I wasn't going to be able to be seen even if I arrived. That I would still be reschedule. I am very unhappy because I had to get time off to go to this appointment. Braces aren't cheap and I feel that they should  atleast allow you to be atleast 10 min late due to life does happen and some of us work. I hope Nallely is more considerate and understanding next time for someone else.< /review>

<resp>{'time': 1620433844344, 'text': "I am very sorry that we let you down. This is not a normal situation for us, but it has been harder after Covid regulations. We are very strict about our staff health and this occasionally may mean we operate with fewer staff and the same amount of scheduled patients. Combine that with short orthodontic appointments and that makes it harder to give the same level of attention to those on time for appointments, let alone those late. It is our policy to turn away patients 10 or more mins late, but we rarely stick to it. Especially if we are fully staffed and running on time or ahead of schedule. Nallely was only carrying out our policy, because we asked her to reschedule late patients for this busy day. She is an exceptionally amazing employee and we are honored to have her. I hope that we can make it up to you in the future Sandra. Happy Mother's Day weekend to you and hope all is well!"}</resp>< gmap_id>

The entire staff is amazing! There is a very organized and professional work ethic to help us all safe and healthy and yet get our orthodontic work complete. The communication is obviously well thought out: getting text messages to emails to remind you of your appointment and what to expect when you arrive at the building to be checked in for your appointment. This office has been well trained to comply with COVID-19 regulations and they do it in a cheerful happy way!</Review>

My son and I both had an appointment at CCO today. The extra steps they did to make sure we were healthy and safe to be seen was very reassuring. All of the staff were kind and courteous as they always are. I'm very happy with the care my family receives from the team at Central Coast Orthodontics!<//Review>

<review>I highly recommend Central Coast Orthodontics. I have been taking my two kids and absolutely love the friendly staff and excellent work that the Orthodontists do. I've gone to other Orthodontists for estimates but Central Coast Orthodontics was by far the best in overall service and I love how they make their clients feel extra special with events and prizes. They are very generous.</review></record>

The first thing I noticed was how beautiful the office was. It was very clean and organized. The receptionist were very friendly and polite. They helped me get checked in quickly. I received an office tour by Kara, who is amazing. She answered all my questions, very professional and put my nerves at ease. Dr. Specht went over my treatment options. He is very knowledgeable and a wonderful doctor. I’m super excited and nervous to embark on this journey, but after my initial meeting I know I’m going to be having great experiences each visit.</review>

I felt very comfortable around the staff and other orthodontists. The service there is amazing, it doesn't take long for my appointments, and it's a lot more professional compare to how I serve my customers in a sushi restaurant. The people there definitely knew what they're doing. They treat me more than a patient, it's like I see a love of what they do in their jobs. I recommend Central Coast Orthodontics!

<Review>I came in for a consult for Invisalign and my experience was fantastic. The staff was so nice to me and the doctors are knowledgeable and really friendly. I have known Dr. Specht for about 20 years now and He has my trust. I trust him and his staff. Everything is top of the line and very clean.< /Review>< Time>

By far one of the best, if not the best Orthodontics I've been to. The staff is very polite, and helpful. The Orthodontist themselves are extremely carefully and quick to get the job done. They are very professional.
I went in looking to have my bottom row of teeth straightened and they did an excellent job, no complaints. You can rest assured to be in good hands at Central Cost Orthodontics. I would highly recommend anyone to give them a try.< /Review>

Central Coast Orthodontist provides an extraordinary experience. Nothing like coming in and being treated like family and be respected, regardless of your age. Outstanding front desk service, there's never been a day I didn't get a joyful greeting. Makes getting your teeth checked up an exciting appointment rather than an annoying one. The staff are true professionals and make sure that everything that's being done to you is informed before, instead of being surprised while in the chair. They listen to criticism well and apply the necessary work in order to get you the perfect smile, your the one that knows your teeth best. The office itself is a work of art, They provide a comfortable waiting area along with magazines to keep you entertained. The service itself, they're always trying to find the new best way to get you your perfect smile in the most convenient way by finding and using state of the art equipment. Overall, my experience here has been nothing but extraordinary. The best part as a patient or guest, when your finished with your appointment, they have a fridge with a variety of ice creams that you can choose. FOR FREE!! What orthodontist does that???? Central Coast Orthodontist keeps up with its generation demands and is always pushing to provide a fun new experience when you come in, like hosting different ruffles and contests through out the year. Central Coast Orthodontist is what the future of Orthodontist should be. Your journey to perfecting your smile should be a non-hustle yet professional experience, not a scary one. Definitely recommend!!<//text>

<Text>Enjoyed the "lounge" with its coffee and magazines, improves the waiting time! Did not see Leydi's name on the list below, so I am responding to that here. She was very pleasant and professional. The ice cream is a nice touch and a great treat after my appointment.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>115470092552791915170</userid><Rate>5</Rate>< gmap_id>

<text>We came in for our initial exam for my son and liked the office right away!  Everyone was friendly and my son felt welcomed and comfortable.  After the consultation, we decided this is the office we would like to use for orthodontic care for our son.  We came back for the digital scan and are eagerly awaiting his Invisalign aligners that will be coming in soon!  We look forward to spending the next 18 months getting to know the staff as they continue to work with us.  Thank you for a warm and welcoming start!<//text>< Response>

<Text>We had our first visit / consultation a week ago and I couldn’t be more pleased with your office. Not only was it clean and easy to find but everyone in that office was so wonderful and friendly. My brother left feeling confident and excited about getting braces, that alone made the visit worth while. Thanks again!</Text>< pics>

The staff is friendly. The appointments are quick. My kids get so excited to go due to the fact they get to choose which ice cream they want after each appointment. When starting treatment certain times of the year they give out amazing prizes. Currently they are giving away a car for referrals. Both orthodontists are wonderful.< /text>

I have brought both my kids here for their braces. One got regular braces and one got Invisaline. Wonderful experience. Very friendly doctors and staff. There is never a long wait. I like how they are always trying to make great changes to their system and staying up with the social media and technology!!</text>

<Review>As soon as I walked in the staff were very welcoming! After being called in I received a small tour and was able to relax when I saw pictures all over the walls of happy partients after their treatments which made me feel like I finally came to a trustworthy Dentist. Also, the doctor was very friendly and made everything very easy to understand while giving his best recommendation about the treatments that needed to be done.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80ec6c9c46e3abb9:0xa01b367b96190092<//gmapID></record>

This place is simply amazing! You will hands down get the best orthodontics care offered. The atmosphere is friendly, professional and welcoming. I seriously feel like I want to be close friends with everybody who works there. They are very accomodating with their scheduling and provide the upmost care and concern when it comes to your dental needs. My teeth are gorgeous and I'm extremely pleased with how efficient and how accurate their services are. I was actually sad to get my braces off...cause I would not be able to see them every month!< /review>

This office is truly one of the best around.  From the awesome Staff right down to the amazing Dr. Specht. This office is fun for the patients but professional at the same time. They treat their patients like family, an experience you leave feeling good about.  Would recommend them to everyone and I do. 😉
P.S. the free ice cream isn't a bad perk either!<//Text>

I went here for four years and I really liked it because the staff was always nice to me and after every appointment I got to take ice cream home that they provided. 😋 Once I got my braces off I got a free photo shoot to have my photo put up in their office which was pretty cool.<//Review>

If I could spend the night getting my braces done, I would. It is so relaxing and the people are so nice I felt I was at home. I recommend this place if you’re looking for people with personality and attentive qualities, can’t wait to tighten up my braces next visit!</review>

Each time I come in for my appointments I am promptly greeted. I am signed in by the front desk staff and wait less than 10 minutes to see the dental assistant or see the Dentist. I am happy with their service. I have made several referrals to their office without any benefit to myself. I am happy this office is part of our community.</review>

We’ve been coming for the last 2 years for my 2 boys. One is about to start treatment and the other is being monitored. Dr. Specht’s office has been amazing and professional through all of our appointments. I am excited and confident that our journey will be nothing but exceptional!</Review>

<time>1494282664394<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Dr. Spect gave us alternative treatments that other offices did not, specifically a device instead of head gear which my child wouldn't have used. Great customer service and office staff. Usually no (or a very short) wait in the office and this is important to me as a busy mom. My daughter really likes to earn her points and rewards at each visit. We are almost done creating a beautiful smile!<//text>< pics>

I have been a patient for about 3 years, and my experience is quite enjoyable. When I was younger I would love coming for the ice cream, now I love coming, because the people are super nice and I know they are doing the best for me. Also Dr. Specht is my neighbor so its awesome.</text>

I have been to CCO for brief treatment and always received the best. The doctors truly care about you and the treatment you’re receiving. You walk in and are greeted by friendly smiles from all of the staff. Everyone is kind and makes you feel comfortable here at CCO. The yummy goodies help too! Central coast orthodontics is definitely the best around the area and I would recommend them to everyone!<//Text>

<review>I was a patient when I had orthodontic treatment a few years ago and when it came time for my son to undergo orthodontic treatment, I had no doubt where I was going to take him. Visits are always pleasant, treatments are progressive and results are amazing. I am confident and trusting in the staff and Orthodontists in this office, they really put their patients first. I would refer them to anyone! And who doesn't like ice cream after every visit?!< /review><username>Nicole Dominguez< /username><userid>102579402379297692516<//userid>< rate>

I am a current and partially new patient at Central Coast Orthodontics. I had my first visit/consultation in October and I remember thinking to myself once I left the office "what a unique ortho office" my first impression was great because I was greeted with kindness and care. I remember being mind blown by all the time and effort the staff have invested on making appointment visits enjoyable. I was surprise to find out about all the commodities they have for us patients such as a photo booth, children play area, washing station and the best part of all FREE ice cream! I honestly felt like a kid again. Without hesitations I can joyfully say I look forward to my appointments. So far I have met Dr. Barrett he is very professional, helpful, and kind....................I highly recommend Central Coast Orthodontics!<//Text>

I’ve been a patient at central coast orthodontics for a little over 2 years.
Today is my last official appointment and I can truly say that the experience has been pretty awesome. Gaby for the most part was the one who received and checked me in for 90% of my appointments, and she always did it with the biggest smile.:))</text>

Absolutely in love with the up to date Orthodontic care that our children are provided, and at a reasonable cost.  The value is worth the investment, as my whole family feels confident about the care they are receiving.  It is all executed in a super fun and friendly environment, with welcoming staff and assistants.  The doctors have exceeded expectations and our children love the interaction.<//text>

From the time I walked in and when I was taken to the back I was treated great.  Very professional and I was explained everything until my next appointment.  The orthodontist was awesome as well as the dental assistants. They always see you when your appointment is scheduled which I love highly recommend this place 👄</text>

I'm currently a patient at Central Coast Orthodontics, and it was not hard to pick this place to do my braces. You're always greeted with a warm welcoming smile. The staff is awesome and makes scheduling appointments easy. Their office is fun and unique. They have a board that they write your name on if it's your first day and it lights up. It's a awesome way to be welcomed. Not to mention free ice cream after every visit. Plus some cool prizes and giveaways. I highly recommend Central Coast Orthodontics, I always look forward to coming to my appointments!<//review>

Central Coast Orthodonics is great. First impression was that the place was so clean and welcoming. We took a tour around the office on our first visit and were introduced to the staff. We talked about what our initial goal was with the treatment. It was an easy decision on this office after searching a few places. My daughter is now close to being done on her treatment with braces and we are very impressed on both doctors who are very detailed with their work. My daughter can be picky and the doctors focused on small details that she was concerned about to ensure that her smile was great. The receptionist, Gaby, was helpful when it came to scheduling appointments around our busy schedule. I felt comfortable with letting my daughter in on her own and working all of that out with the help of the receptionist. Great place over all. Definitely recommended.<//text>

This by far one of the best orthodontics in Santa Maria. The receptionist Gaby was very helpful and informative, when asked questions about insurance coverage and future appointments. The DA Ramon is incredibly friendly and makes you feel comfortable. You won’t be dreading youe next ortho/dental appointment anymore.<//Review>

My daughter has just had her braces put on at Dr. Spect and Dr. Barrett's office. She is the first in our family to have braces! She is 12 and filled with questions. I love that the staff is so supportive and patient with everything. It is always a joy to come into the office, everyone is always friendly and happy. I love the incentives they give the children to keep up on their grades and dental hygiene. Dr Spect has been popular since I was back in early college, I am thankful he is here still on the central coast so I can take my daughter to him for straight teeth. I know she will have a more beautiful smile when she is done with her braces!</Text>

The staff is very welcoming and friendly. They Fill the room up with comfort and hospitality. The doctors go out of their way to make me feel special and comfortable. By far the best Ortho I've ever been too. I highly recommend the invisiline! I'm about to be finished with my treatment and I use to be shy to smile, but now I have people telling me "your teeth look great"! I'm so very grateful for central coast orthodontics.</text>

<review>I'm very happy that I decided to get my Invisalign treatment at Central Coast Orthodontics. Dr. Specht and the entire crew are amazing at what they do! They always make my visits special by asking me how I am and how my treatment is going.  I enjoy being greeted by everyone their. Not only do they have amazing gifts that they give you when you first start your treatment, you also walk out with some free ice cream with every visit! Overall the staff is what makes this place so incredible. They really care about their patients and do their best to make them happy. I don't think I've ever been to any other dentist or orthodontics with such an awesome staff and a great environment. Central Coast Orthodontics is the best!</review><response>None</response><userid>112871093413561365888< /userid>< rating>

Best experience ever! The staff, doctors and facility are amazing. I took my niece here, and the doctors took really good care of her. I'm forever thankful for the help and the caring they did for her.
The ice cream for the patient and her party, yum! I love ice cream. Coffee as I waited for her appointment to be done! Yes please, thank you and the celebration they did on her last visit to take her braces out, what a nice touch. They spoiled her and that made me happy. The little touches to show their appreciation means a lot. I have never been to a office that felt welcoming. Thank you doctors and staff for everything. May God Bless You All.

<Text>I just can't say enough about Dr. Spect and his amazing, friendly and very good looking staff!!  My son had his braces put on and from the time we walked in the door they made him feel so comfortable and they just encouraged him and made him feel so special! Especially Kara! She is not only beautiful and friendly but she always had a way of making my son laugh! I thought he would be nervous but she made him feel like he was with friends which made me relaxed and so we knew that we were in the right place! He loved the free ice cream after every appointment and I loved the customer service that more than exceeded our expectations! If you are looking for a place to go for braces...go see Dr. Spect!  Top notch all the way!!</Text>< username>

Dr Specht and Dr Barrett are AMAZING! I am an adult wearing braces for the 3rd time in my life with suggestion of my Peridontist. From the beginning they have explained every process in complete detail and if I ever had any questions about treatment, they were prompt to attend me to answer them. They offer an affordable payment plan being a cash pay patient and the billing staff is great to work with.  From the time you step foot into the office, the front desk gals quickly remember who you are and check you in. The back office staff of wonderful in taking their time and making sure you're comfortable during adjustments.  They are all very caring and kind. The office is immaculately clean and they even have an awesome ice cream freezer for you to have a complimentary ice cream when you leave!  Appointments are very convenient and you don't have to wait weeks when having an issue with your braces to get seem. I would HIGHLY recommend this practice to anyone looking to get Orthodontic treatment and can promise you won't be disappointed in your care and end results!< /review>

Best experience ever! The staff, doctors and facility are amazing. I took my niece here, and the doctors took really good care of her. I'm forever thankful for the help and the caring they did for her.
The ice cream for the patient and her party, yum! I love ice cream. Coffee as I waited for her appointment to be done! Yes please, thank you and the celebration they did on her last visit to take her braces out, what a nice touch. They spoiled her and that made me happy. The little touches to show their appreciation means a lot. I have never been to a office that felt welcoming. Thank you doctors and staff for everything. May God Bless You All.

<Time>1557862557494</Time><Text>It's rare you walk into a place and think, wow I would love to work here. That's the friendly, fun and exciting atmosphere they give off! When you walk in you're greeted right away by beautiful, happy smiling faces. They walk you through checking in and you have a seat. The wait time is always short and they are always well staffed! All of this isn't even my favorite part...
What is so cool about this place are the incentives they give children to stay up on the things they are supposed to do.. they have an app called "the Hub" that the kids can accrue points on when they do certain things, like: a's on report card, cleanings at the dentist, coming to appointments, etc. my daughter has never been so excited to keep her teeth clean but now knowing those points turn into gift cards when she wants to turn them in... I've scene a difference. Such a great way to get kids on board with all of this (because she wasn't very excited).
Another awesome touch is the ice cream at the end. It isn't really about the ice cream per se to me but the excitement that they're getting a special treat and keeping these appointments upbeat and positive. My daughter feels like it's a special treat to walk into CCO and I hope this leads her to keep having a healthy and positive attitude when it comes to the dentist office.
I haven't even gotten to the actual medical stuff yet.. we have talk to other orthos that just kept telling me to wait.. wait.. wait. But the difference with Central Coast Ortho and the other offices are the depth of the initial consultation. Central Coast Ortho took pictures of my daughters profile, they took x rays and did a full exam. They were able to see some concerning issues that are not just cosmetic and could affect the future of her permanent front teeth. If I kept waiting and didn't get the consult from CCO I could very much be dealing with a much scarier issue when my daughter got older.
They presented me with all my options for her age.. they offer in house payment plans which make this journey a lot more feasible and they often have a monthly giveaway when you start up (my daughter got an iPad!- but this changes monthly)
If you're on the fence about what you should do with a child- or your own because they have adult patients too, I suggest going in and just talking to them. The first consult is free and you really have nothing to lose.</Text><UserId.>114782672179142804233</UserId.>< Response>

<text>I came to see Dr. Specht for removal of an old permanent retainer and replacing it with a removable one. The entire experience was great--from calling to schedule, to being greeted when I walked in the office--everyone I encountered was friendly. Kara helped remove the retainer and the process was quick and painless. Dr. Specht was extremely personable and made me feel like I was the only person in the office (even though there were a myriad of other patients in the treatment area). The visit was quick, efficient, accomplished my goal, and didn't break the bank. I would recommend this practice to anyone in need of orthodontic work.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I'm very happy that I decided to get my Invisalign treatment at Central Coast Orthodontics. Dr. Specht and the entire crew are amazing at what they do! They always make my visits special by asking me how I am and how my treatment is going.  I enjoy being greeted by everyone their. Not only do they have amazing gifts that they give you when you first start your treatment, you also walk out with some free ice cream with every visit! Overall the staff is what makes this place so incredible. They really care about their patients and do their best to make them happy. I don't think I've ever been to any other dentist or orthodontics with such an awesome staff and a great environment. Central Coast Orthodontics is the best!< /Text>< Date>

<review>I highly recommend Dr. Spechts office. I did not encounter Dr. Specht himself, only his amazing staff. I went there to get new retainers when mine broke prematurely (made by a different Orthodontist, a few years ago). I actually switched Orthodontics because of Violeta, she is so kind and treats me like family. The rest of the staff are also amazing and I very much enjoyed the complimentary ice cream 😍. P.S. to whoever selects the ice cream, you're amazing!</review>< Resp>

The staff at Central Coast Orthodontics (Dr. Specht & Dr. Barrett) is so friendly! It's genuine!  I didn't feel like they were just trying to get my business, I truly felt like I mattered! They explained everything thoroughly and made me feel welcome and at home! I will always refer people to this office!</Text>

I love central coast orthodontics, I was honestly unsure if I wanted braces or Invisalign and they informed me of my options and were extremely efficient in the whole process of my Invisalign. Typically, orthodontists have their patients change their trays every two weeks but Central Coast Orthodonitics let you change them weekly and it speeds up the whole process and hurts less with each tray. You also get a photo shoot at the end and they track your progress with pictures. Overall I love going to the dentist and that’s a first!< /text>

We have had nothing but excellent care and great experiences at Dr. Specht's office. Couldn't ask for a better crew to take care of our family's orthodontic needs. Thank you to everyone in the practice. Great people!<//Text>

I highly recommend Dr. Spechts office. I did not encounter Dr. Specht himself, only his amazing staff. I went there to get new retainers when mine broke prematurely (made by a different Orthodontist, a few years ago). I actually switched Orthodontics because of Violeta, she is so kind and treats me like family. The rest of the staff are also amazing and I very much enjoyed the complimentary ice cream 😍. P.S. to whoever selects the ice cream, you're amazing!</text>

I was a patient of Dr Spechts and I have nothing but great things to say about his business. Everyone is very nice and he has free ice cream. This is definitely the best place to go for if you want top quality orthodontist work.</Review>

<review>The nervous feelings go away the minute you are greeting at the front desk. The information you receive regarding your treatment also puts you at ease knowing you are in the hands of compassionate professionals.  The equipment is state of the art, and to this day, nothing ever caused me pain!  I am 10 weeks into treatment with my invisaline and it is amazing how quick the progress has been. I have a unique situation with needing a temporary fix needed with my invisalines, and the first batch gave me some trouble, but the staff was quick to remedy the situation when I came in for my second batch.  Aside from that, my experience has been the best ever! I can not wait to get my daughter started with hers<//review><UserId.>107345166266502500842< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

The best place to go for you or your children's ortho. Not only do they do amazing work, but they also treat all of their patients in the most caring way. Dr. Specht will always greet you with a warm smile as well as his staff. They are the BEST!!!</Text>

My coworkers and I visited Central Coast Orthodontics a few months ago. I had already been in contact with one of their employees. From the moment I met Elizabeth we literally just clicked... as soon as we parked and walked into the buiding Elizabeth had already been waiting for us outside. She welcomed us with open arms and the look on my coworkers face was as if they've known her for years. As soon as you walk into their office everyone is so welcoming and always asking if you need anything. Dr Spect himself is just all around awesome! It's no wonder their patients love the staff and doctor! They're just beyond GREAT! I'm from Los Angeles and if anyone asked me for a recommendation of an Ortho in Santa Maria -- I without a doubt recommend Central Coast Orthodontics!</Review>

My daughter who was VERY scared and skeptical about getting braces but they put all her worries to rest and she LOVES the free ice cream after (what kid wouldnt). I would defiantly recomend them to everyone i know. Thank you for being so amazing!!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Central Coast Orthodontics rocks from the moment you walk in the door until you step out... the women in the front are always so welcoming and quick to check you in, I have never waited for longer than 10 minutes, EVERY dental assistant is caring, gentle with my usually nervois 9 year old, and thorough with their explanations. My daughter still talks about how awesome Kara is even though she has her braces off. Dr. Spect and Dr. Barrett are calming, very friendly, and professional. Also, the choice of icecream each visit is pretty cool to 😉

Both my 9 year old daughter has completed phase 1 and I am in the middle of my Invisalign treatment.< /Text>< Pics>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We met Dr. Specht after having consulted 2 other area orthodontists regarding my daughter's need for ortho treatment. I felt that the other orthos made a rush to judgment about removing 4 of my daughter's adult teeth immediately and then beginning treatment. Dr. Specht felt that we should wait until she'd lost all her baby teeth in order to determine if the removal of 4 adult teeth would indeed be necessary prior to applying braces. He saw her at regular intervals at no charge for almost 2 years before she lost all of her baby teeth. And guess what? It turned out that with just the baby teeth gone... there was enough room in her mouth to accommodate ALL of her adult teeth. Voila! Good call Dr. Specht! Your patience and good judgment paid off on Delilah's behalf!! We love the care and service we've received from you and your staff from beginning to end. Delilah will soon be getting her braces off and her teeth look BEAUTIFUL!!!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I have two sons currently in Invisalign at Central Coast Orthodontics with Dr. Specht. I was absolutely blown away by their kindness at our consult appointment. The front office is so happy to see you when you walk in.  I'm not kidding when I say that every single person that we have come in contact with at their office, has treated us with warmth and greets us with a smile on the their face. My kids love it here as well. The environment is welcoming and fun. They are always having contests and prizes and have fun things going on at the office. We got treated to a full Taco bar on Cinco De Mayo. Of course my kids would say that their favorite part was getting free iPads when they started their Invisalign. (That was the promotion going on at that time but they always change it up.) They also get to choose an ice cream from the ice cream bar at every visit when they leave. Most important to me is the the doctors are knowledgeable and really help you to understand all your options and make you feel so comfortable as well as the kids. I highly recommend this office to anyone looking to improve their smile. You will not be disappointed coming here!!!< /Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) It is a truly pleasant experience when all the staff at the complex treat you in a kind and friendly way, who are greeting and willing to explain the information and answer your questions. The two times I have been to Central Coast Orthodontics I have been satisfied and happy with the excellent service. The place is also very clean and they are very well organized. 👍🏻👌🏼👏🏼
