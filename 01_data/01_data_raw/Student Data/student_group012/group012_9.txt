<text>So before I had my 3rd child, we had given our dog to a home where he could be taken care of in a better way. This was in August of 2019. Flash forward to like early February and i get a call from the fine officers of Clovis PD, mind you i live in Hanford. They say my dog had been hit by a car and I was confused, until they said he had his old collar on with my number. Anyways, couldn’t find any information on the person we gave him to, they say he needs evaluations and surgeries and they would look for his current owner and asked me if they could contact me if that search was not successful. I said yes. So today i get a call. 31 march 2021. They ask if i can claim him. i say yes. This dog, tiny chihuahua, had been neutered, had a hip surgery, was dewormed, had a rabies shot, and got microchipped. Yall i kid you not, they said no charge as long as I give this doggy love and a good home. He remembers us all now and my baby absolutely adores him. This place is divine. They care for their animals, and have a no kill policy and lifetime commitment. Thank you all at this place for being so gracious and caring. I want to donate things, money, time, or all of em. You make the world a better place.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80945c89803cf26b:0xd4186a23dee608c8<//Gmap_id></record>

When they opened in their other location I heard great things about Miss Winkles centers & I've seen super reviews from the way placement is handled to the screening qualifications and found its still true today. They definitely get a 5 star rating from me for continued excellence.< /text>< pictures>

<review>This is a great place to take an animal you can't rehome or kittens that are in need of attention. They are a low kill shelter and that makes me feel much better about having to drop these animals off there. Customer service is great! Very nice people.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
I wish I could have given it 5 stars. I wasn't there long enough to see more of it. The lower rating is because they are in an older building. It is positive because I think they put any funds they get into caring for the animals and not just a pretty building. It was staffed by a Clovis Police Officer. He was knowledgeable and efficient in helping me bail out my 18 year old cat. One of my neighbors must have reported her to them because they came into our gated property about 2 hours after she was let out. There was no charge to take her home as most cats are not retrieved by the owners. I left a small donation. I recommend considerin City of Clovis Animal Control for donations of time or money or pet supplies.</Review>

I for sure know the bowl of food and blanket they let him use during his 1 day stay did not cost $50. Thankfully i could afford the fee for the stay and the microchipping. But if i couldn't have....then what? Idk can't really put a price on your fur babies life, it's just not everyone can afford that and the bill gets higher and higher by the day. Buuut 5 stars for saving my Ace's life by holding him.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I dropped off a dog that we found running on Fowler. The female officer was polite and professional took my information and took the dog with out a problem. It was a little depressing looking but clean. I would have given it more stars but I don't like their hours. They need to be a little more flexible with their hours.< /Text>< Pics>

I saw a loose dog running near shaw and he ended up luckily walking into a neighborhood so I called these guys and told them I would wait near the dog until they came and a half an hour later no one showed up and they did not even pick up the phone or return my call when I tried to call them. I tried to get the dog myself but he would run away and I had to leave. The staff here and these services are wasting our precious resources and money while endangering the animals they are supposed to protect, this needs to change<//review></record></dataset><record>

<name>Jack Snider</name><Date>1498788378630<//Date><rating>1</rating><text>I found some kittens that had been abandoned by their mother due to someone leaving their scent on them and looked to call this place.  I reached a volunteer on the phone and explained my situation, and I was told that she had to talk with her boss.  Well, what the boss didn't know is that I was able to hear their conversation and what I heard was not only offensive, but proves the lack of care these workers have for these helpless animals.  Behind my back, the conversation were things such as, "They started this mess, so they need to finish it," and, "they should've just left them there."  All 3 kittens would've died in the 110 heat, and overall, I was shamed for rescuing these babies, and saving lives is not something to be ashamed of.  I would highly recommend staying away from this unsympathetic facility, and opting for the Valley Animal Center.<//text>< Pictures>

Impossible to find lost animals online. Every click sends you to Miss Winkles! If you are looking for a lost dog, it's not at Miss Winkles yet. Why not post pictures of the animals that are at the Villa location so people can find their dog?? It's more like a secret what dogs are there! I would even volunteer to take pictures and post them!</review>

Good overall value. I prefer the thin crust. Tip them well in advance & tell 'em to go crazy on the cheese & they'll usually make your pizza just the way you like it.< /Review>

<text>Horrible Service right here.. I put an order to pick up @3pm I arrived exactly @3pm the cashier said my order was coming up. I watched 4 customers come in and received there order. I asked what was the delay with my order he couldn’t give me an answer so I asked to speak to a manager and he asked for my name and gave me my order. I asked him what is your policy with delays and he said we are busy today.. Franchise owner needs to implement customer service to his employees. I will never come back to this store again.</text>< pictures>

Most should know what a Papa John's chain tastes like and so this quick review is mainly focused on service. Simply put this restaurant location is on time completing orders accurately and politely. Good pizza at a low to moderate price.< /Text>

< Review>
This Papa John's Pizza location is the closest one to me so this is my go to pizza store when we order pizza.  Typically I go to the store to pick it up since it's down the street from me.  Sign up for their mailing lists they typically have promotions whenever a sports team wins or they achieve a certain goal there's a discount that you can use.

parking:  The parking lot is decently sized but usually there are a good amount of cars in there.  I always manage to find parking somehow.

Ask for their seasoning that comes in the green packets.  They add more of a kick to your food. I believe they charge for chili flakes now too so keep that in mind.< /Review>

<Text>Quality of pizza has not changed, before this visit, it was several years ago. I gave another try, same no good. I asked the pizza to be more crispy, they did not do that, dipping sauce is too small, they give you only one, regardless the size you ordered. I won't be going back for good.</Text>< pics>

Damn, and I love Papa J's :(  This spot is the worst though, going to Dominoes like a block away.

1st time we ordered a Pizza for pickup on our way back from the air port.  Ended up having the order completely wrong.  When we brought it up the kid that looked at it gave us a glare and walked to the back.  The manager (i assume) was decent enough, offered to remake the pizza, but it would take 10-15 minutes.  Not really wanting to wait we settled for pineapple instead of pepperoni.  Meh, not horrible but still a let down.

Tonight i was bothered enough by this to actually create this yelp account.

I went online and set up my order, but google said that they were closed!  Being my stubborn self, I called to see if they were still open.  The guy said they were and they were taking orders for 10 more minutes!  I thanked him and told him I would place my order online, he said okay.  Apparently since it was listed as closed, the site won't allow you to place an order.

I tried to call back, the same guy asked to put me on hold.  Was on hold for about 8 mins (okay maybe they're getting rushed) then the guy picks up apologizes for the wait and puts me back on hold.  Waited another 5 mins.  Tried to call back, no answer.  Really lame!  Stubbornly tried to call back like 9 times (I know I'm nuts) only to be forwarded to their recorded message, hung up on, and at the end just ignored.

I put in my Dominoes order while I was doing this.  I just wanted to guy's name at this point to complain.  Prick, I'd prefer you just lied and told me you were closed!  I set it up and everything!

Call was placed 07/09/16 at 10:43pm (I guess they close at 10:53pm?)

I'm pretty much a consistent creature of habit that tips really well for any inconvenience (late order).  However, my late night munchies don't seem to be appreciated at this location.  I'll be resentfully taking my orders else where.</Review>

I just went today (12/2/2019) got a pretty standard men's haircut. The staff was friendly, the stylist was quick, professional, and was nice to chat with. The price was absolutely reasonable. If you are looking for a great looking haircut at an affordable price, I highly recommend Get a Cut.<//text>

<text>Janet is the best. She works hard to make you look your best. Currently she's the only stylist/barber I've dealt with, and she's easily the best and most consistent barber I've ever had. The parking is in a plaza, but be careful not to miss the turn. The website clearly marks all of the services and the place is clean and comfortable.</text><user_name>Cory L</user_name><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmapID>

Tried this place for the first time after finding the Groupon. First impression was awesome, and I think I've found my new spot. Janet did my hair and was a lot of fun. She knows what she's doing, gave me a great pixie cut. I feel like I made a new friend and can't wait to go back.
They also have a rewards program, coupons, and birthday discount!<//review>

Did have to wait quite a while after my appointment time (that I booked after trying to do a walk in which they say they accept but I wouldn't reccomend) to get in the chair.< /review><gmapID>0x809b2057fcc123d3:0x3b7133fe2ba0c970<//gmapID>< rating>

Got my face threaded and it hurts.  I would have liked my brows worked on a little longer ie shaped better and not so rushed in and out of the chair due to an appointment client coming in. Granted, I was a 'walk in' she should have not seated me if she had a confirmed scheduled appointment.</Text>

In the afternoon on a Saturday in a busy mall they told us there was no coffee. Ok, I could have order a glass of wine, or a hot tea, but come on, a coffee house that has run out of Coffee.

This place used to be my oasis away from it all, about two years ago. The coffee was well blended and you could tell that the baristas took pride and care on their work. Unfortunately, things have changed.

The elixir in the mall of Escondido has turned into another general,  run-of-the-mill, coffee spot. We all know the type. It’s the one that you stop at only because it’s on the way or is the most convenient. The environment is dirty and the inside bottom of the cup is a thick layer of unmixed powder.

Please, get the old crew back or at least learn how they made their coffee! Elixir used to show people what coffee was supposed to be. Now all it does is remind us of how companies sell out.<//review>

Never thought I'd be hanging out in a mall sipping wine or sampling a cheese board, but my boyfriend stumbled across Elixer. What a great, convenient place to unwind after work. It's right off the freeway and has great wine. The staff are always super friendly and the place is a little oasis inside a busy mall. The crepes and gelato arevrealky good too.<//text>

I was at this Westfield mall in Escondido last Wednesday getting a car battery check-up.As we all know getting work done on your car can take hours but my wife and I had recently been to the new Elixir Expresso & Wine Bar in La Jolla and we found out they also have a location in this center.As it turned out Elixir was on the bottom level only a short walk from the store where I dropped my car off.A young lady named Jackie greeted me very happily and took my order for a latte and a crepe.I know their coffee is very good because they use our favorite Caffe Calabria roasted coffee beans at all their locations and their long slim crepes are very good value.Thanks to Ty for making my superb latte and the delicious crepe.And thank the stars I found some place decent to have lunch at because my car wasn't ready for another 3 hours.....and for around $13 with a tip it was great value.Friendly staff,great service,terrific food and beverages and a handy location away from the food court makes this business a winner.<//text>

This smoke shop is awesome! They have a new manager and he is the best! They have a huge selection on anything you need, and if they don't have what your looking for  the new manager will get it in the shop a couple days after you ask for it. 10 out of 10 definitely the best smoke shop I've been too!< /text>

This spot is a great place to go to for all of your "utensils!", whatever your needs maybe. They are open till 2am, have great prices and massive  inventory. Noah is a great merchant, he's knowledgeable, and wont hesitate to help you out. Make sure you get over there< /Text>

Very knowledgeable on everything and extremely easy to talk with.
I bought 1 item at list price and the second item I got 50% off.
Easy parking in front of the store.  I've been buying items from them for over 2 years now, no complaints.<//text>< Pictures>

<Response>None< /Response><text>This place definitely has a large selection like other reviews have stated. It also might close earlier then 2am like others state , but just call ahead if you are going to be later then 1230am and knock when you arive they will open the door and help ya out. The door is just locked after 1am so they can safely clean and restock . The guy working late nights is also super friendly and chill as long as you are chill. Good prices on everything nothing is priced like they dnt really want to sell it like alot of shops do to their cool looking stuff.< /text></record>

Has some what of a selection but is priced high. What they charge for glass I can get 75% less in Anaheim. With that a much larger selection. Also they don't even check for cracks, chips or nothing.< /review>

< review>
I had a severe cycling road rash accident which took large chunks of skin off my arms, legs, and hip.I was going to be needing a specialist medical intervention to treat large section of lost skin (almost the size of my hands) from when I skidded 15 feet on the Pacific Coast Highway and clean out the asphalt, grime, and infections foreign matter lodged deep at the injury site. Dr. Suzuki really saved the day. The procedure took an hour to do all the site clean-outs, infected tissue removal, and he expertly sealed the road rashes. I was incredibly grateful for the pain management, his professional expertise, and a clear recovery roadmap (including wound hygiene and how to prevent my wound from contacting water when I showered) he reviewed in great details with me. He even sent a care package of bandage dressings to last me until the next 48 hrs for recovery. If it wasn't for Dr. Suzuki, my injuries are largely gone without scarring or requiring a skin graft. The wound clean-outs were textbook perfect and the wound sites never got infected or out of control.  He is the best. When you need a specialist, this is the reason why relying on the best to get the job done: bad injuries can alter your life forever and it takes a great doctor to get you back from the abyss.  He is the best. Hands down.< /review>

Dr. Suzuki and his team are awesome. I had an infected ingrown toe nail and  he was quickly able to accommodate me for a consultation and sort out the infection. He is a very personable Doctor who cares deeply for his patients. I have never had a Doctor who gave me a his personal cell phone and asked me to text him progress photos of the recovery to which he provided feedback. I have been to a lot of doctors and he is truly a great one.</text>

<Text>Dr. Suzuki is truly excellent. His skill and experience as a wound care specialist are unmatched. He also cares deeply about his patients, and will go above and beyond to help them achieve the best possible outcomes. He is very careful to take into account the whole medical picture when treating his patients, which I've found to be a somewhat rare quality. Some specialists focus only on the wound or the body part of interest, and ignore the rest of the person! He clearly loves what he does, and that passion really shows.</Text>< pictures>

I’ve gone to Dr. Suzuki for the past three or so years as a part of my marathon training regimen. He’s extremely knowledgeable and every time I’ve had any issues he knew exactly how to remedy it. He has a very pleasant bedside manner which makes you very comfortable and at ease. Much like needing a great pair of shoes to run, having him as a part of my support crew is also crucial. It’s a bonus to have a doctor who not only has the academic knowledge, but first-hand knowledge of what we deal with throughout a grueling training season as he’s an avid athlete himself.</review>

Fantastic! He tended my 92 year old mom for the three months it took for her to heal her leg wound from an accident. She healed beautifully with zero complications. Suzuki was a delight as was his office staff. 100% recommend this super doctor.</text>

I've been quietly dealing with reoccuring fungal infections on my feet for years now, and have been reluctant to seek medical treatment because I heard about negative side-effects with some oral anti-fungal medications. I usually used OTC sprays and creams that relieved the itching and scaling temporarily, but I recently had an episode so bad that I finally decided to visit a doctor. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Suzuki and his staff! He is very knowledgeable and easy to talk to, and his front desk is accommodating. Dr. Suzuki understood my concerns about taking certain medications, and prescribed me something doesn't have the bad side effects I've heard about. I'm happy with the results so far and am looking forward to my next followup appointment.<//review>

<name>Phong Ho<//name><Date>1622426733347< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>As any martial artist or combat sports athlete/veteran will tell you, running is second to none when it comes to cardio and stamina. It is essential to any conditioning regimen and has been so for ages across all martial arts and combat sports. As with any other physical activity, running comes with its fair share of risk for injury.

That being said, I managed to mess up my right foot pretty bad in an attempt to ramp up my running routine too quickly. After doing some research and reaching out to a few podiatrists, I decided to visit Dr. Suzuki's clinic last week. After all, what better foot doctor could there be for a seasoned runner, or someone relatively new to it like myself, than a doctor that actively participates in marathons?

Truth be told, I was a little hesitant at first as I am still unemployed and working odd jobs to make ends meet as a result of the pandemic. However, having previously been a bartender for 20+ years I have a long history of not always taking the best care of my feet. Ultimately it was an investment in my health and continued growth as a martial artist so I was happy to pay for his expertise, insurance or not.

After running the gamut of standard questions and inquiries, (see what I did there?), Dr. Suzuki inspected my foot and explained that it appeared that I sprained the tendons and ligaments near the cuboid bone of my right foot. He explained the importance of proper footwear when running longer distances and instructed me to refrain from any conditioning oriented activities for a few weeks and to put my foot on ice daily.

Additionally, Dr. Suzuki suggested I look into his recommended "go to" shoes and socks as an avid runner, and gave me his email to "pick his brain" if I had any foot or running related questions in the future. He told me that I wouldn't be needing any shots or additonal treatment, and gave me a complimentary mask/sanitizer bundle for my girlfriend and I.

Then with a grin on his face, Dr. Suzuki proceeded to tell me to feel free to make another appointment with him in the future when/if I have a serious foot injury. He then sent me on my way free of charge! Words can't quite express the debt of gratitude I owe to Dr. Suzuki and his staff for their patience and kindness. It is beyond refreshing to find a doctor that is a true healer in a city where a fair amount of people are only in their respective fields for monetary gain.

Thank you Dr. Suzuki! 👊🙏❤</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1622427774315, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Phong. Have a great weekend!'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b9320ee4ca47:0x6e6499b6e9803c81</gmap_id></record>

Amazing wound care!  I’ve had a deep gauge in my leg for 10 days and been to doctors and urgent care and on antibiotics the whole time.  But it was not getting better. Dr Suzuki and his staff are true professionals and are the experts for wounds.  He took care of of my wound surgically and painstakingly, without a blink. I feel so relieved.  Go to see him!  He’s the best!!!!!<//Text>

When I called this doctor to refer a friend, his customer care was top notch and unparallel. The level of care he had for her was not only professional but treated her as if she were his family.  Highly recommended.</Text>

<Text>I got a severe third degree burn from a dirt biking accident.  My original physician said I needed a skin graft, and my wound was not healing after 4 weeks.  I saw Dr. Suzuki for a second opinion who was able to clean out my wound properly and without removing skin from another part of my body.  I saw immediate results.  The wound started healing after seeing Dr. Suzuki.  He helped my wound heal without requiring a skin graft.< /Text>< Rating>

Dr Suzuki was recommended by Dr Harry Saperstein when a positive result for treatment to an infected wound was evading us.
Dr Saperstein sent the problem to the expert and the desired conclusion was realized forthwith.<//text>

<text>I had a severe cycling road rash accident which took large chunks of skin off my arms, legs, and hip.I was going to be needing a specialist medical intervention to treat large section of lost skin (almost the size of my hands) from when I skidded 15 feet on the Pacific Coast Highway and clean out the asphalt, grime, and infections foreign matter lodged deep at the injury site. Dr. Suzuki really saved the day. The procedure took an hour to do all the site clean-outs, infected tissue removal, and he expertly sealed the road rashes. I was incredibly grateful for the pain management, his professional expertise, and a clear recovery roadmap (including wound hygiene and how to prevent my wound from contacting water when I showered) he reviewed in great details with me. He even sent a care package of bandage dressings to last me until the next 48 hrs for recovery. If it wasn't for Dr. Suzuki, my injuries are largely gone without scarring or requiring a skin graft. The wound clean-outs were textbook perfect and the wound sites never got infected or out of control.  He is the best. When you need a specialist, this is the reason why relying on the best to get the job done: bad injuries can alter your life forever and it takes a great doctor to get you back from the abyss.  He is the best. Hands down.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSJBasLZfqZwbhjvxCiCJd2owpPaHecYew0iMI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

<Review>Dr. Suzuki and his team are awesome. I had an infected ingrown toe nail and  he was quickly able to accommodate me for a consultation and sort out the infection. He is a very personable Doctor who cares deeply for his patients. I have never had a Doctor who gave me a his personal cell phone and asked me to text him progress photos of the recovery to which he provided feedback. I have been to a lot of doctors and he is truly a great one.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b9320ee4ca47:0x6e6499b6e9803c81<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Dr. Suzuki is truly excellent. His skill and experience as a wound care specialist are unmatched. He also cares deeply about his patients, and will go above and beyond to help them achieve the best possible outcomes. He is very careful to take into account the whole medical picture when treating his patients, which I've found to be a somewhat rare quality. Some specialists focus only on the wound or the body part of interest, and ignore the rest of the person! He clearly loves what he does, and that passion really shows.</text>< Pics>

He’s extremely knowledgeable and every time I’ve had any issues he knew exactly how to remedy it. He has a very pleasant bedside manner which makes you very comfortable and at ease. Much like needing a great pair of shoes to run, having him as a part of my support crew is also crucial. It’s a bonus to have a doctor who not only has the academic knowledge, but first-hand knowledge of what we deal with throughout a grueling training season as he’s an avid athlete himself.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Due to infections in my feet, Dr. Suzuki has been my Wound Care Specialist for over 2 years now.   His expertise has saved my leg from amputation & there are no words to express my admiration for the diligent care he & his staff have given me.   I highly recommend Dr. Suzuki to anyone dealing with leg issues of any kind.   He & his entire staff are THE BEST.< /Review>

I had a excellent experience with Dr. Suzuki. He and his team were super friendly and helpful. Dr. Suzuki is also an accomplished athlete and it made my appointment so much easier because he was so relatable. He listened to my concerns and was able to get me back on my feet in no time. He’s an extremely qualified surgeon and was able to help me understand the extent of my injury. Amazing service. Highly recommend!<//text>

<Text>I've been quietly dealing with reoccuring fungal infections on my feet for years now, and have been reluctant to seek medical treatment because I heard about negative side-effects with some oral anti-fungal medications. I usually used OTC sprays and creams that relieved the itching and scaling temporarily, but I recently had an episode so bad that I finally decided to visit a doctor. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Suzuki and his staff! He is very knowledgeable and easy to talk to, and his front desk is accommodating. Dr. Suzuki understood my concerns about taking certain medications, and prescribed me something doesn't have the bad side effects I've heard about. I'm happy with the results so far and am looking forward to my next followup appointment.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>As any martial artist or combat sports athlete/veteran will tell you, running is second to none when it comes to cardio and stamina. It is essential to any conditioning regimen and has been so for ages across all martial arts and combat sports. As with any other physical activity, running comes with its fair share of risk for injury.

That being said, I managed to mess up my right foot pretty bad in an attempt to ramp up my running routine too quickly. After doing some research and reaching out to a few podiatrists, I decided to visit Dr. Suzuki's clinic last week. After all, what better foot doctor could there be for a seasoned runner, or someone relatively new to it like myself, than a doctor that actively participates in marathons?

Truth be told, I was a little hesitant at first as I am still unemployed and working odd jobs to make ends meet as a result of the pandemic. However, having previously been a bartender for 20+ years I have a long history of not always taking the best care of my feet. Ultimately it was an investment in my health and continued growth as a martial artist so I was happy to pay for his expertise, insurance or not.

After running the gamut of standard questions and inquiries, (see what I did there?), Dr. Suzuki inspected my foot and explained that it appeared that I sprained the tendons and ligaments near the cuboid bone of my right foot. He explained the importance of proper footwear when running longer distances and instructed me to refrain from any conditioning oriented activities for a few weeks and to put my foot on ice daily.

Additionally, Dr. Suzuki suggested I look into his recommended "go to" shoes and socks as an avid runner, and gave me his email to "pick his brain" if I had any foot or running related questions in the future. He told me that I wouldn't be needing any shots or additonal treatment, and gave me a complimentary mask/sanitizer bundle for my girlfriend and I.

Then with a grin on his face, Dr. Suzuki proceeded to tell me to feel free to make another appointment with him in the future when/if I have a serious foot injury. He then sent me on my way free of charge! Words can't quite express the debt of gratitude I owe to Dr. Suzuki and his staff for their patience and kindness. It is beyond refreshing to find a doctor that is a true healer in a city where a fair amount of people are only in their respective fields for monetary gain.

Thank you Dr. Suzuki! 👊🙏❤</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Amazing wound care!  I’ve had a deep gauge in my leg for 10 days and been to doctors and urgent care and on antibiotics the whole time.  But it was not getting better. Dr Suzuki and his staff are true professionals and are the experts for wounds.  He took care of of my wound surgically and painstakingly, without a blink. I feel so relieved.  Go to see him!  He’s the best!!!!!</Review>

I got a severe third degree burn from a dirt biking accident.  My original physician said I needed a skin graft, and my wound was not healing after 4 weeks.  I saw Dr. Suzuki for a second opinion who was able to clean out my wound properly and without removing skin from another part of my body.  I saw immediate results.  The wound started healing after seeing Dr. Suzuki.  He helped my wound heal without requiring a skin graft.</text>

Dr Suzuki was recommended by Dr Harry Saperstein when a positive result for treatment to an infected wound was evading us.
Dr Saperstein sent the problem to the expert and the desired conclusion was realized forthwith.< /Text>< Resp>

I like the clothes. But I don't like that they offer 60% off and you get to the store and its 40% off. Bought two items and still paid $93. So they really don't have sales. They just give a discount on marked up prices. So you are still paying the same thing. As you can see in the picture the Pants price is $129. paid $64 for 1 pair of pants.</Review>

Helpful staff. Jesse G. had me looking sharp with his personal and attentive styling. I felt like it was a private shopping experience. Will be back for sure.<//Text>

<Text>Ugh! Come on BR Southern CA stores get it together! I don't think some people realize what a drag it is to go to a mall on a weekend, in the heat, around tons of people, and limited parking.
I usually shop on BR's website because the customer service is terrible! This store is no exception
If a manager is reading this please coach your team: if someone comes in to your store the expectation is for the staff to be flexible. If it has to do with a size or maybe a misunderstanding of a sale item price work with the customer
I'm all for going by the book, but if a person has sufficient evidence for their argument, and you don't know what to do or are second guessing yourslef call a Manager and learn from the situation.< /Text>< gmapID>

I tried returning a new, unused pair of pants WITH receipt and they refused to take it because it was purchased at a factory store. Yes, same company, same Banana Republic label on the pants, but they claim it is not their product and they can't take it. Again, HORRIBLE customer service, HORRIBLE "company policy."

Michael at Victory Auto Body is the best. He informed me about the process and kept me updated every step of the way. When my Mercedes-Benz was hit by another driver, I knew that small collision affected my hood, front bumper, side, and headlight. Luckily it was fixed in less than 2 weeks. My car came back shiny, clean, and just as perfect as it was before the accident. I will be using this body shop again if needed.</Review>

I would definitely recommend Victory Auto Body to others. Their very professional and work hard to satisfy the customer. Cheryl John and Mike Are excellent at keeping the customers happy. Great team effort by all. My daughter was in a wreck and the shop did an excellent job on the repairs and getting the vehicle back in great shape quickly.< /Review>

<Text>My car came back restored and cleaned, and they fixed my tire pressure, all of which is very appreciated. However, I found the customer service lacking. I had an appointment to drop my car off and was told I'd have an estimate the next day. When it didn't come after two days, I called to inquire and didn't get a call back until I called my insurance company on day four to complain. On Friday, day four, two hours after talking to State Farm, Mike the manager called and said they're getting started that day and I'd have my car on W or Th; it would only take three days. On Tuesday, I finally get the estimate I should have gotten the previous Wednesday and my car was estimated to be ready on Friday or Saturday; they were just getting started that day. My car was ready Friday evening. I'm not upset about how long it took; I'm upset about the dodging of my calls and lying to me. It's disrespectful and poor customer service.<//Text>< Pictures>

I have nothing but good things to say.  From the moment I dropped off my vehicle to the time it was done, excellent service and communication.  I always spoke with Mike; he is so professional and friendly.  I got regular updates by email and text letting me know how it was coming along, and it was done a few days before their estimate.  And the repairs look beautiful (just wish the rest of my vehicle looked as nice now!).  Would definitely use them again if I am ever in need of similar work.
I also got my vehicle back cleaner than when I took it in, and I noticed that since they had to paint most of the right side of my van, they filled in a few chips that were on my hood as a bonus. Very highly recommend.</Review>

If you're seeking fast, communicative, great workmanship and value, I cannot recommend Victory Auto Body enough. Victory Auto Body fixed and painted my cracked bumper with amazing precision. In comparison to other body shops,  it's the little things like ample parking on their property, maintaining a clean and tidy office, valuing my time, and returning my car to me, cleaned and vacuumed, that I can really appreciate.<//text>

<Review>Best Auto Body shop in California!!!! I am very particular and did my research for auto body shops. Victory Auto Body in Burbank had so many great reviews so I chose them and I am beyond grateful I did. Mike and his team are phenomenal!! Top notch quality of work, very honest, professional, fast and friendly service (they treat you like family).  Everyone there is always friendly and happy to help you. They kept me informed of the progress every step of the way which I reallly appreciated.  My car came out looking and running better than new. I would definitely recommend Victory Auto Body to everyone. I guarantee you will be happy with your experience here< /Review>< pictures>

Best experience with a body shop! I was merged into by another driver who accepted responsibility (shocking) and went to a couple of different body shops. Of course, all were annoying and one even stated he needed to keep my car for 15 days without even seeing it in person- the gall! I decided to go with Victory after meeting with Michael. He was straightforward and honest. I dropped my car off the next day (Saturday) and they started working on my car right away. It was ready and PERFECT by that Friday, as promised. I was kept informed of the work and progress all throughout, which I greatly appreciated. This was my second visit to a body shop and I went to a family friend prior and had to take it back as they screwed it up royally- I wish I knew of Victory before as it would have been evident that they would have gotten it right the first time. Great Job, great service, don't hesitate- they are awesome.</text>

5. The results were better than I was told to expect!

I first saw Victory Auto Body’s 5 star rating on Yelp with more than 650 reviews! I wondered how that could be possible. I brought my Nissan van in for a front bumper repair, got a free estimate, they ordered the parts and they came the next day. VAB repaired my van the same day the parts arrived and in less than half the time they told me. Now I know why they’re rated so highly. They deserve 5 Stars!<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I was going through a lot of trouble with a previous shop that was trying to take advantage of my insurance. I called Armani and his team made it all work without any extra stress or unknown dues/fees. No hassle or sketchy business. These guys know what they’re doing.

<Text>I have worked in the City of Burbank for many years. I have known about Victory Auto Body for a couple of decades now.  Well, I finally needed their service… WOW… What great service I received!
I took my poor broken vehicle to them after being a victim of a hit and run on the freeway.  I gave them my vehicle and I was assured they would take care of it.  They did ! ! !
They worked directly with my insurance company and received all the approval needed for the repair. They worked hard for me and assured that my vehicle would be good as new.  When I received a call telling me my vehicle was ready, I was excited. I arrived and saw all the repairs were completed and my vehicle was clean and shiny.
I am very happy with the work done and the care given to both me and my vehicle.
I highly recommend anyone to use Victory Auto Body, you will be glad you did…< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
Arman at Victory Auto Body is beyond incredible. My insurance company referred me to Victory and I have been a loyal customer ever since. My car's windows were smashed from a break-in, and Arman and his team quickly took care of it and made the car look like new.  Arman even battled with the insurance company to get them to approve of an issue from the break-in that became evident months after the initial repair. Since then, Victory has taken care of all my auto needs, including repairing a dent, and smaller issues such as re-affixing my license plate. They are attentive and provide great customer care.

You couldn't ask for more professional, personable, fairly priced, and wonderful people to work with! Highly recommended.</Review>

Great service! They care about their customers and make sure the job is complete. Received my vehicle back before the promised date, a rarity in this business. And their prices are lower than the competition. Adding a complimentary inside and outside detailing is a nice perk.

I’d highly recommend this shop.<//Review>

<Text>Armani and the entire crew at Victory Auto Body took care of all my auto-repair needs from start to finish. My Toyota Prius C had major bumper damage from a collision:  Armani saw to it that every detail was attended to, and he returned my car with a shiny new bumper,  beautifully painted and looking great!  While my car was in the shop, Armani took all my phone calls and patientlly answered my questions and updated me on the progress of the work on my car.
A few weeks after that, I went over a curb and a small corner of the bumper popped out of place. I brought the car to Armani and he had it tightened back into place while I waited and did not charge me.  Armani is patient, knowledgeable, attentive and takes pride in his work and in the work of Victory Auto Body.
I strongly recommend him and the entire crew at Victory Auto Body for all your auto-body work.

I chose Victory Auto Body after I was sideswiped and needed to submit for repair through my insurance.  But, I had some other body damage I figured I may as well get fixed while the car would be in the shop.  They quickly provided me with a cost estimate for the additional repairs which was very reasonable.  Their customer service is EXCELLENT.  They kept me informed every step of the way.  They even touch-up painted some scratches I had on the rear of my car...not to mention the wash, wax and detail that was done prior to them returning my car to me.  I truly can't say enough about their knowledge, friendliness, communication, transparency and quality of work!< /Review>

<review>Hands down one of the best auto body shops. Mike was able to get my car fixed and it only took 3 days total. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to get a quick professional repairs.
10/10 to this place. ASK FOR MIKE.<//review>< pics>

I brought my car in to have them fix a botched job from another auto body shop.  They were amazing! Armani and Mike has my car fixed and I was back on the road in no time. Super friendly too!  I will definitely be back to them FIRST next time!</review>

Victory auto body did an EXCELLENT job repairing my car after it was damaged in a parking lot. They also called the rental car company who came and got me.
I highly recommend them. Not only were they kind and curtious, after they repaired my car, they detailed my car inside and out !!
The whole experience was stress free from start to finish. Thank you Victory auto body !
5 star service !</Review>

<Review>I just picked up my car from victory and they did GREAT work. On top of that, they helped me through a truly brutal time with insurance (two different companies, 4 different adjusters, 3 appraisals, and WEEKS of delays) with professionalism and ease.

I'd 100% recommend them to friends and family -they really impressed me and I was very happy.< /Review>< Pictures>

When you go to an auto body shop, you generally assume you're not getting out for less than $500. The sliding door on our minivan broke and my mechanic across the street was unwilling to look at it, saying it would be a big ugly job involving removing body panels, so I drove it here. They had it good as new in hours for $80. Fast, friendly, and helpful people. They could have gouged me for a few hundred bucks and I would have just paid, not knowing any better.

Obviously, I have no real idea how they'd do on a major job, but I certainly left with a good impression.< /text>

This is the second time I have had repairs done at Victory Auto Body and they really go the extra mile.  They did a fabulous job on the smashed bumper and even repaired some minor scratches in other places on my car!

<text>Victory auto is awesome!! The manager Armen took good care of me while I was there gave me in detail what would be done in my car and the girls in the office are friendly and knowledgeable Vanessa was great answered all my questions and concerns. I was very impressed by the craftsmanship and speed it was done they finished my car a week before the original due date not to mention the good price they gave me,  I really recommend victory auto for anyone who has any auto body work to be done.< /text></record></dataset><record>

My daughter recently got in an accident and her front bumper was dented she looked for several Auto Body Shops and found Victory Auto Body Shop. The insurance gave us a list of body shops and we found this autoshop the best! The other body shops looked skeptical but at Victory Body Shop they gave  a very friendly environment they made you feel good about leaving your vehicle their they gave me an exact date of when I was able to pick up my 2018 Dodge Challenger and it was ready on the day they gave me! No games played they fixed and polished my car they left it brand new! Im very glad that we chose Victory Auto Shop best decision made!<//Review>

I have had all of my cars there at one point or another, and i have to say that the level of quality & professionalism is unsurpassed anywhere.  My first experience was 2002, when my MBZ Drivers side window was busted out. Since then I have been back there 4 more time with different cars and every-time a very satisfied person.

The folks at Victory Auto-body are always polite, respectful and professional and there work is top notch.

I definitely recommend them.</Text>

They were on National Insurance's approved list, but I checked reviews first. I was pleased with the ratings so I tried it out. Not only were they rock solid on the repairs they worked with me when I was called out of town on business towards pick up date. Though I hope you never need, I highly recommend them. Driver's side rear door all better, and they did an amazing detail, which was a challenge since we had just been on a 40 day trip!< /Text>

Victory Auto Body has been my go to twice already in less than 2 years since being hit driving through LA.  They are professional, quick, make sure you feel comfortable and also have a contract with enterprise in NOHO so they pick you up for your rental and drop you off to pick up your car once it's done.

Thank you guys for taking care of my baby!!

P.S. they even washed and waxed my car while it was there.  Nice touch.  Definitely recommend this spot.</text>

Awesome service. Took my vehicle there during Christmas week (which means they took at least two days off) to replace the drivers side front fender, headlight, and bumper and it was done in a week. Beautiful work. Mercury insurance worked with them to send me emails to track the repairs of my vehicle as they progressed. They included an estimated finish date which helped me to figure out how long to borrow another car. They beat the estimated finish date by 3 days.< /text>

Brought my 2013 Dodge 2500 pickup for bumper and paint damage and they did an outstanding job and quick too since I use my truck daily for work.  They are local San Fernando valley guys who run an honest shop.  As I hope not to have another car accident, but if I did they are the ones to bring it to.< /Text>

From the second i stepped on the lot i was greeted and reassured they will make my car like new. Will see how the repairs go but so far so good
Update 5/2018:Had to return three times to get the suspension shop they used in NoHo to tighten bolts and fix camber. Car was dangerous to drive in the first week almost crashed was all over road. A year later bolts lose again. Paid 80 bucks to have a no name guy to fix it and is finally okay now...< /text></record></dataset><record>

This was an amazing little trail, there is also other trails that you can pick up while you are out there. Lots of ups and down, and lots of shade tree's, and many different types of flora and fauna to see.<//review>

<Text>The Oak trees are coming back! It looks like Mars post fire caused by lightning. The massive boulders look scary but are held by the hard ground. I feel safer with much dry brush cleared out. The first big rain we might cause five feet of ashes</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Nice trail in the City of Murrieta’s Cole Canyon Natural Park. This park and trail burned in the 2019 Tenaja fire, and there remains significant fire and erosion damage to the area. Limited parking at trailhead, which is in a residential cul-de-sac. Trails are established yet unmarked. Suitable for hiking, trail-running, mountain biking, and equestrian. Dog & kid-friendly. There are some nice areas near the stream to relax on some giant rocks in the shade of some of the remaining oaks. Good spot to get a local nature fix!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Convenient trail access because it isn't far from town, but we parked on a cul de sac, no parking at the trail entrance we used.  Nice easy trail for 0.8 miles, then gets narrower, steeper, Rocky and slippery in places.  Just wonderful to be able to get away from civilization for a while. Links up with longer trails, too.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Fallbrooks BK isn't that bad! It's a lot better than other in other cities. I don't go but once in a blue moon IV been in Fallbrook for 5 years IV gone there like 5 times... First time was really good. Tasted like I got a fresh burger right off the charbroiler the last time I went that Whopper was sitting out for at least 30 min. So if it in a pinch and you see and smell the smoke rising out of the  kitchen go get a fresh burger! It's gonna taste better than most BK's<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Why is it every time I come here I feel I have to fight with these people when I ask them for a fresh burger or fresh chicken nuggets?  Half the time more than half the time I go and I wait the extra time for it and the food is still cold.  I literally am sitting in front of the Burger King right now waiting a second time for food that's supposed to be fresh and when I came to the drive-thru window again for a second time the lady sat there and told me she just made it right now...but it was cold.  obviously wasn't fresh.  lame.<//Text>

Order was hot, service was quick at the drive through, and no mistakes on the order. The impossible whopper is as good as the regular whopper.<//text>

As a city local I hate to say this especially since I like BK but this order was just bad. I order the 2 for 12$ combo and a kids meal & 20 nuggets and the bread was cold and hard :/ the fry's were luke warm and mainly stale and the nuggets were nt even close to warm. I don't normally leave bad reviews but this was bad enough to make me want to leave a negative review. Sorry guys.<//Text>

<text>I like BK better than McD.  But I am local and this location is painful.  I have tried and tried to get them on a good day, but there just doesn't seem to be one.   The fries taste like they were cooked a week before you order them.  I have yet to order a drink that did not seem like a nasty play on whatever flavor of soda I ordered.  Lastly it always seems that whoever is working is not only learning on their first day, but they are not aware that it is called "fast food"... Not "whenever food".< /text>< username>

For a promotional item that is on special the crispy taco I have ordered it through the drive-through the last five days two times And they were exceptional today I went inside and ordered the tacos and they were the worst greasy tacos I have ever had I threw away the remainder of the tacos because they looked and tasted like they were days old.  Apparently this item Burger King does not wish to sell if they’re delivered in this condition

Five Stars for the type - obviously not "fine dining". :)  The Fallbrook Burger King is located on the Main Street side of the Major Market Shopping Center.  It is kept clean, service is quick and cheerful. If you are dining in, they will bring the food to your table - at least they seem to do it for seniors & people with disabilities.  I like Burger King food - it is quick and tasty.  This place is no exception (I have been to some that do not live up to BK standards.) Clean restrooms too.  Buy a homeless person a Burger King meal.< /review>

It is kept clean, service is quick and cheerful. If you are dining in, they will bring the food to your table - at least they seem to do it for seniors & people with disabilities.  I like Burger King food - it is quick and tasty.  This place is no exception (I have been to some that do not live up to BK standards.) Clean restrooms too.  Buy a homeless person a Burger King meal.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Spent $39.53 for my kids to eat and we had to wait 30 minutes in the parking lot, for a mobile order. Then they forgot 3 items in my order.</text>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! It seems that every time you go after 9pm the night shift crew always gives you bad attitude like that’s the last place on earth they want to be in I don’t like to go places and be treated this way that’s why I stop coming to this location. (Don’t be surprised if you find disgusting things in your food!) in other words go under your own risks!< /review>

<review>Today i went around 8pm and when i was ordering Urbano (a worker) had a bad aditude towards me and my family he had a rude tone of voice. When i got my order Yovanni (worker) was kind and told is if we needed anything and to enjoy our food that was the only good thing about going after we got our food my daughter went to ask for sauses and Urbano (worker) said their was not any more sauses and im pretty sure there was but he did not want to give any to us and after he started laughing with the other workers  i found that rude.next time I know that they are going to treat us with a rude adittude i know not to go there.< /review>< gmap_id>

I’m sure this is a minor pet peeve but sometimes, it rains in California and you get drenched in the drive thru placing your order cuz there is no roof to cover you at the ordering window or pickup window-like say Mcdonalds does and a few other places. I truly appreciate that.</Review>< rating>

<review>Been here 4 times since moving here. All 4times my order was incorrect..... They wrote my name in "the manager's book".
Kind of irritating cuz
- hungry , not able to eat(Not plain as ordered/..allergies)  gosh  reason should not matter. ...not what I ordered.
Chicken fries  burnt,black ,half normal size ,  half completely hollow, not even 1 edible.
No spicy sauce 2different time s .
On and on. Used to be favorite in other cities.   Very upsetting.<//review>< name>

Terrible customer service we asked for 2 spicy chickens and a medium fry while there’s a 6 dollar mix n match deal and she charged us 13$!! I went back and said something and she told me “you didn’t ask for it” well you could’ve been curtious and asked me if I wanted to save a couple bucks<//review>

Usually pretty good but the last two times the chicken fries have not been good at all. They seem like they've been precooked, not fresh. And overly crispy, almost burnt.<//Text>

If you want to eat crap come to this bugger king!  you read it not a typo , we ordered a whopper and a salad,the burger looked like the manager had masterbated and guess what put it in the sauce, my husband went and gave it back tried to get money back, the manager said it went back on card, but never did, so they're also thieves, to top it off, worst place to eat in the entire state of CA!!!! Buyer Beware!<//text>

<review>Seriously ... whose bright idea was it to build a Walmart with only two cash registers? The self checkout lanes are no better. Lines are always so long. God help you if you need liquor or toiletries as many of the items are locked. You push a button for a sales associate to open the case for you and it takes them forever to get there. That is if they even bother to show up at all. A good place to shop if you have all the time in the world. Otherwise, I suggest you shop elsewhere.</review>< Pics>

I like this store for groceries. Its closer to my house than the super walmart is so when I just need to pick up items like food and cleaning supplies, I choose to go there. It always seems to be really busy. But even when the line is long, their self checkout is pretty quick.< /review>

1 half asleep customer service employee.  Loooong line of people.
Tried two different days. Finally just stood in line for 1 HOUR

Walmart work on your customer service...for goodness sake, just pull that half asleep person stocking the shelves when there's a surge.<//review>

Stepped up with keeping shelves stocked. Frequently the public restrooms are up to clean standards. A few months back they added more self-checkout stations. So the cashier power was reduced...creating long lines at those registers. All and all a good place to shop. If you like to be RIPPED OFF BY SAM WALTON AND COMPANY!!!< /Text>

It's ok,  lots of people wearing masks, jus does not have lots of offerings. Low stock, small choice of wat brand, and the women's shoes are very ugly, not a big selection, never my size which is eight and half. Then the woman's clothing section needs improvement. Cuter choice of clothing for plus size women..........and then there is checkout and check cashing sigh......it takes forever< /review>

Usually over crowded since there aren't many grocery stores in the area. Or possibly, its the lower prices that draw in the crowds. Either way, be ready to wait in a long line.

<review>Its the lines that get me. I waste more time waiting in line than I do the shopping. Whether that is self check out or someone ringing me out. Usually I'm in and out and only need a few things, but I wait at least 10 or more minutes. either a machine is down or they have 2 cashiers.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Nice employees and helpful. So cool inside I could shop and breathe. Thank you. Line's way too long to check out 6-9 people in line each lane 1 checker. Not enough. Plenty on the floor to stock not enough at check out to help. Had to run back to get another item due to the sku number incomplete. Line waited etc. Sad. Other wise great! Clean also except bathroom.<//text>

For the most part I run in and out as quick as I can. Store is too over crowded and they shouldn't have closed other bigger location near by. Staff do what they can hence not docking more stars.</Text>

Was in line for over a half hour- must have been at least 30 people in line for the customer service desk. They only had one lady working the counter but numerous other employee's were just bee- boppin' around with seemingly nothing to do- ya think one of them would have come and helped that poor woman all by herself at the customer service desk. Will nev
er go again if I can help it.<//Text>

I am writing to commend the amazing customer service provided by the store manager at Walmart on Marconi. I work for an organization that supports people with disabilities and was informed that when one of our clients was there recently, they found themselves in the unfortunate circumstance of not having the funds to fully pay for their purchase.  The manager of the store paid for the purchaser out of his own pocket much to the surprise and delight of the customer. I would like to personally thank and commend the management of Walmart for their outstanding  customer service.< /Text>

Maybe it’s just me but every time I’m in this place it’s jam packed. Lines for the few checkout clerks halfway down the isles and lines wrapped around the side for the customer service station. Every trip there is a minimum 30-45 min just waiting in line.< /text>

<Text>The pharmacy is what keeps me coming back the service from employees mainly thier checkers is absolutely awful
Last night was my last stop I had a fad a fabulous day
The checker was the rudest by far i have experienced at this location and she was in the management team.
Very desturbing.
I do multiple shopping for our Seniors. Duly note my business will not be at this Walmart Neighborhood Market on Marconi.
All the Walmart stories heard about Customers
Everyone has one
The Service recieved shouldn't be the source. Bad service should be fired so they really can be rude.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

There staff is always friendly and helpful, Kermit is such a sweetheart  he went in the back and got me disinfectant  wipes being 8 35 weeks pregnant  and nesting like crazy ot ment alot to me his going out his way. His manager is even nicer the woman I spoke to to tell her about my experience  was genuinely happy to hear the feed back and when I came in to pick up an online order insisted on helping me load all of it to my car!<//review>

The Wal-Mart on Marconi near Howl avenue  is a no-frills store. I've been going to this Wal-Mart for 10 years or more. On occasion I've shopped at Safeway and Raileys stores and was blown away at how different and nice they looked compared to my ol" Wal-Mart. Don't get me wrong! I like different and nice as much as the next shopper. But I've worked so hard to know where every item I could possibly want or need is. I even look forward to saving some other shoppers day by telling them exactly where what their looking for is. I still catch myself visiting they're competitors stores from time to time.< /Text>

Not only was the clerk very nice and helpful but i want to give a shoot out to the security guard. She was on everything! I was impressed on how she handled a few different situations. She needs a raise! Thank you all for being on the front line.< /text>

It's the closest to my home. Shelves are never fully stocked. My favorite checkout lady has got a job at this one. She's the only one I allow to check me out. She's friendly and very responsible in what should be packed together. Love her and she's the best thing about this store. Please stock your shelves fully.< /text>

Convenient local. Try to get in early to beat the crowd before noon or at least before 3. Not the biggest so they have a smaller selection here, so beware that. If you like to do most of your monthly shopping though I would suggest a different Walmart Grocery location with a bigger store, but its great if you forgot that little something for dinner.<//review>

<Text>This place is awful. Seriously. I avoid it at all costs. It is always so busy, but it wouldn't be so bad if it were a bigger place...but it is not. The lines go through the aisles do you can barely move around in the store at all.
Everything is locked up, so you constantly need to ask for help to get items. The employees are nice, but that's about the only good thing that I can say. The only reason that I have recently been there is to pick up a medication from the pharmacy. And even that was an adventure.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Needed to find my daughters fiance who worked here. Went to customer service counter to ask where he was. Stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes or more watching 4 employees talking to each other. Not one said anything to me, no "hello, we will be right with you", each of them looked at me, saw me standing, obviously needing service, and completely ignored me. No customer service what so ever. Worst Walmart, and thats saying something.  Will NOT shop at Walmart ever again</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>The first thing that I noticed was the automatic gate that is installed at the entrance, it only opens one way so I soon gathered that it was to prevent people from exiting in that direction. I brought my friend here to find a couple of items and was disturbed by what I can best describe as a prison atmosphere. The gate that opens one way, the excessively large monitor hovering above the checkout area that surveys the entire store, and the men guarding the check out area and exit. It is not welcoming at all, and I would not recommend this particular store for the reasons that I shared.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Do I really have to tell you it's great? But, I'm kinda over the not so subtle price increases. As if we have a say over their tactics. They got us by the shorties!</Text>

<Review>Crowded. Full of dirtballs. And based on the number of people in the customer service line trying to pay their bills, I will assume these people don't have any sort of bank account in which they can make electronic payments or they are in danger of getting something turned off, like their power, cable or getting a vehicle repossessed or something of that nature.

if you want to just pick up a few items and use self-checkout, then it is not so bad. But remember, it is Walmart.... Need I say more?< /Review>< pics>

The customer service line is regularly backed up and around in front of the pharmacy. Ive been in the line for 25 minutes and no one is clued into the customer service element that is absent from this line. Not sure why the reps at the counter have no idea how to expeditiously conduct business for the sake the customer service line.< /Review>

Convenient , close to home , but  self checkout is the way to go under a certain amount of groceries. Seems prices are lower , maybe obsevation. Not as stock as supercenter walmart but has mostly what I need.</review>

3.o stars...If not for the long check out lanes, getting assistance out on the floor due to several items listed on shelves at one price but skd tag at another(higher)price.It would give the rating 3.5 or almost a 4.0 The customer service of those who came to help when they did show up it made all the difference in how frustrated i was.. #1store leaders need to make sure products on shelves match the price on the shelves and is in the right spot. #2continue to be friendly,curtious,and timley when a customer needs help on floor.The attitudes and their smiles make a big difference.#3Get customer service counter more efficient.Once you reach the cashier its quick.Its getting to the cashier that is "BAD."Spending 20-30min in line is crazy</text>

I go here all the time cuz they shut down the one closest to me. The money center line is almost always at least a half hour wait. Everything else is decent, if your using self checkout it is suprisingky fast believe it or not. Will be back but if there was one closer I'd go there, this one is used only out of necessity</Review>

I shop here once or twice a month. Store is usually well stocked but been there a few times that it wasn't. Could use a couple more mobility scooters ASAP. Men's bathroom could use a bit more attention and one of the sinks needs fixing. I need to use  one of those scooters  from time to time too. I have found the employees to be very friendly and helpful in finding items or getting the right price of something. I appreciate the employees personal attention they give to me even when they're busy. Overall I am very satisfied every time I visit  this store and have made this store my home store now for the last 4 years. 👍👍<//text>

What's crazy about this Walmart is at certain times you can get a pre-made extra large pizza covered in meat for 6 dollars. All you have to do is throw it in the oven and you got an amazing deal. I am not sure at what times this expiration deal happens but anyone trying to save money will love it if they come across the deals where they need to sell food fast.< /Text>

Never again! I'd tell you what is wrong but dont have that much patience to go into detail. You would think it would be cleaner, faster, better selection as they are competing with 4 other grocery stores within walking distance but bad.... REALLY BAD!</Review>

Come here a lot most of the time easy in and out. However watch out in the parking lot my good friends mom got ran over by some kids and and had a compound fractured leg. So keep your eyes open and watch out for the idiot that isn't watching for you<//text>

Way too many employees with carts filling up the shelves they block the aisles, check stands are full you have to wait in line too long definitely not a good experience. I will not be coming back their prices are not any better for better quality food at other stores like Safeway< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>The staff does its best to provide good shopping experience,  but this location has obstacles in this area. High theft,and the lines are long as Walmart appears to be phasing out real people to check out groceries and push self checkout. Because of the abundance of people shopping here, they frequently are out of stock of many basic items and or have large pallets of food on the sales floor being restocked or moving from one area to another. I try to avoid this location as much as possible. Clearly not the employees doing but a Corporate issue within Walmart that needs to be reassessed.<//Review><time>1615667504688</time>< UserId.>

<Review>Worst Walmart ever.. people fighting in the parking lot, people asking you to buy their food stamps inside the store, never any carts or hand baskets, bare shelves most of the time.. They're always out of essentials & I'm always left wishing I went to the winco down the road.. don't waste your time or money..< /Review>< rating>

Getting better, healthier choices and products in, thank you for that.... but so much of the shelves are empty! Why? I wish the employees were more friendly. This is the least friendly cashier bunch I've ever encountered. 😟</review>

< Review>
Why are so many products locked up these days? I wanted a diabetic related item, but had to track down an employee, who had to go get the key to unlock the case. Once the items were removed, I was told they would be held at a certain register until I was ready to check out. The check out area is a nightmare. There are two registers to the lane where my items were, one self check out, one regular, but there isn't enough room to pass the first one to get to the second one, especially if you're in an electric cart, like I was. You can't even tell which register the people are waiting for. While I was driving around, looking for a way to get to the register where my items were, a nice employee offered to help me, but even that got confusing as to where she wanted me to go, and how to get there. In all the confusion, I had to leave my 92 year old aunt (whom I was supposed to be helping) in her line, so I could purchase my items at a different register. Too much hassle. Don't plan on returning any time soon.<//Review>

<text>I shop here twice a month or more. The price is reasonable, but there is usually a wait for the lines for both self checkout and regular checkout. Customer service line is extremely long if you go during the afternoon. Some items I’m not able to return because I purchased it in a regular Walmart store and they don’t carry the item. I would have to visit the Walmart elsewhere. This place is small, but you get what you need in the store.
You have to call someone to get the cosmetic for you since it is locked. I don’t think the button next to the cosmetic works at all. I pressed more than five times and no one comes to grab the item. The employees are usually busy with other customer and take a long time to come and grab the cosmetics. Also after the employee grabs the item, they put it in the register. You will get your item when you checkout.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

Never enough staff.Long lines to checkout.Shelves are never stocked.Its called SUPPLY AND DEMAND ! Heavy customer traffic(demand) yet they cannot keep the products available.
Customer service area always has a very long line.Only 1 employee ???? Why ??
From peak time "10am -8 pm
two employee's is absoutley necessary.
Save yourself a headache.....do not visit this location.<//text>< Pics>

Few weeks ago my mother locked herself out of her van. I came to help but I wasn’t able to do much. That’s when Alberto showed up, mind you he was in the middle of doing something else, he helped us open the van within minutes. All the while talking on walkytalky doing his actual job. I appreciate this dude he is a great selfless employee!</review>

<Review>It's nice to be able to get things at Walmart prices. However , the disgusting cigarette smoke that comes in while waiting in line is horrible. The store could be a little cleaner. The employees are almost ALWAYS yelling from across the store talking about how drunk or high they got the night before. Most of the cashiers are super nice and very patient. I appreciate that.<//Review><Rating>3</Rating><time>1543874942841</time><Pics>None<//Pics><UserId.>117433654547027231641</UserId.><response>None<//response>< user_name>

I bought something online. It didn't worl. I took it today and the staff is not trained well to handle a simple task as putting store credit on a gift card. I was there 40 minutes 2 leads or in charge people later and still could not figure it out. I was told to go to a Supercenter to get it returned. I am disabled and when I was able to purchase onlineband pick up at my neighborhood Walmart I was happy. Its hard for me to get around. Left there really disappointed.< /text>

Its either a hit or miss experience with this store.  Sometimes items are stocked that I  need, most times not, sometimes handicapped parking is available most times not. I try to avoid shopping there like a plague and before I do, I pray and hope.

I was hoping this would save me a drive to Safeway but it won't. Very poor selection of produce and a worse selection of wine. A fair selection of meats and poultry. The employees were very friendly and helpful. There is just not enough selection of items we use to shop here.< /Review>

Some good prices, meat is very high, always panhandlers out front, rickety electric carts often none available because lazy able bodied people joy ride for hours on them..  electric carts are rarely followed out, no help for real handicapped, no wonder so many are stolen, just drive away!!!ok?? pharmacy is notoriously slow.. and many of your shoppers dress like street walkers...I don't like Marconi Walmart , too much trash walking about<//Text>

<text>Omg... this place is the worst.  Every "the people of Walmart" meme you've ever seen is brought to reality here.  The checkers are rude and the producer is sub par.  I definitely would not gamble on the meat products here either.  The milk is gross, like it was allowed to get too warm.  The prices are good, but only at great cost to quality and environment and customer service.  I am definitely not a fan.</text></record>

<Review>Interesting...all went good while shopping went well.  Lady behind me was very rude and pushy...putting her items on the belt before I could empty my basket ..push her basket into me before I cod get out of her way.  The store was extremely busy..while existing the line trying not to bump in to other customers the woman was hitting my heels with her basket...not once excusing her actions...I was talking to a couple of your cashiers about how rude she was...it was completely unnecessary to do that to a senior citizen...I am in my 70's she looked like maybe in her mid 50's...other than that you have a ver nice store and great employees....< /Review><rating>4<//rating>< resp>

<Review>DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!!!! I was at register 1 last night around 1045ish and I ASSUME that there was a loss prevention staff that wanted to accuse publicly a customer that was behind me with her basket of stealing.  this sorry employee was so loud and disrespectful that he blocked my movement from putting my food on the conveyor belt and walking up to pay for my items!!! he was so disgusting that he was yelling at the top of his voice accusing the woman of stealing and HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK ME TO JOIN IN SHAMING THIS WOMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT GOT WORSE WHERE HE ATTEMPTED TO BLOCK HER FROM LEAVING WHICH IN TURN BLOCKED OTHER CUSTOMERS FROM LEAVING THE STORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE LATER DECIDED TO ALLOW AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS TO ASK THEM TO CONTINUE TO SHAME THIS WOMAN FROM STEALING!!!!!!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO LOSS PREVENTION QUIETLY ASKING A PERSON ACCUSED TO COME WITH THEM????? THIS IDIOT BLOCKED THE EXIT SO MUCH UNTIL I WENT THROUGH THE ENTER DOOR!!!! OTHER CUSTOMERS STOPPED AND WAS WATCHING THIS DEBACLE!!!!!! I WILL NEVER EVER EVER SHOP WITH WALMART AGAIN!!!!!! OH AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, I JUST SPOKE TO THE MANAGER, SHE STATED THAT SHE WILL LET THE STORE MANAGER KNOW HOWEVER SHE DID NOT ASK FOR MY CONTACT INFORMATION, NOTHING TO COMPENSATE FOR MY EXPERIENCE AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED?!???< /Review><Rating>1<//Rating><Time>1560713611750<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Waited for assistance with a locked cell phone charger display almost 25 minutes. This was after asking two different supervisors for help. Then spent another ten minutes to check out. We actually could use a larger neighborhood Walmart, this location often runs out of items. It's convenient but customer service gets two stars, but hey... it's Walmart!
The store has the basic supermarket amenities. Not much for speed of service... the parking lot is well lit, and they do have a small customer service counter.<//Text>

< Review>
Brought a kombucha drink from here. It expires 4.27. Yet it taste like it is already expired. Manager said other people need to come in with the same complaint for him to take action. Basically others need to get sick first. I hope I never need to come here again. Sad place to shop. Fruit selection always is bare and beat up.</Review>

Shelves are never stocked properly. Has gone from being a decent place to pick up groceries to my least favorite place to go.  They have some very helpful employees but also have some employees that need lessons in customer service.</text>

Interesting...all went good while shopping went well.  Lady behind me was very rude and pushy...putting her items on the belt before I could empty my basket ..push her basket into me before I cod get out of her way.  The store was extremely busy..while existing the line trying not to bump in to other customers the woman was hitting my heels with her basket...not once excusing her actions...I was talking to a couple of your cashiers about how rude she was...it was completely unnecessary to do that to a senior citizen...I am in my 70's she looked like maybe in her mid 50's...other than that you have a ver nice store and great employees....< /review>

This store needs some new management...I've never seen a Walmart look so bad they have so many outs there's pallets left on floor boxes jus sitting there no employees really around to help u and the lines are always so long because there's only 1 maybe 2 cashiers and they are extremely slow...I knw its n a bad neighborhood but Walmart has higher standards for their stores. regional needs to take a step into this one!</Review>

Since the location at Watt and El Camino has closed this is now my go to Walmart. The staff is nice and shelves are in pretty good shape. Some areas like household cleaners tend to be sparse. But as a whole I enjoy shopping at this location.</text>

<Text>I went to the Walmart Neighborhood Market because the Walmart I usually go to was closed permanently. I like the flavored water brand that Walmart carries. Specifically the Fuji Apple flavor. On the day I went there weren't any of the Fuji Apple flavor. In addition the twelve packs of strawberry flavor were also not on the shelves. It was a disappointment.< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating><user_id>111751662517950873410<//user_id><Time>1527317215824</Time></record></dataset><record>

This "neighborhood Walmart" is nice and convenient especially for quick in and out matters. There's not a lot of traffic here compared to the "Super Walmart's", naturally there's way more to choose from, but it's nice to be able to quickly go into a grocery store and get out and on your way. Also there's a strip mall right across the street with Ross, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Trader Joe's, and more!< /text>

< Review>
I went to the Walmart Neighborhood Market because the Walmart I usually go to was closed permanently. I like the flavored water brand that Walmart carries. Specifically the Fuji Apple flavor. On the day I went there weren't any of the Fuji Apple flavor. In addition the twelve packs of strawberry flavor were also not on the shelves. It was a disappointment.<//Review>

<text>One cashier for a line that spread back to the freezer isle.  Their solution was pulling people from said line over to the self checkstands. I was quite offended by the stockers using foul language with children clearly in the immediate area.  Repeated foul language...discusting.   One stocker made it clear to me with heavy sigh and body language that I annoyed him trying to go into the isle he was working on.</text>< pictures>

Customer service was good. There were plenty of registers open and the store was a bit crowded /busy.  The store was clean and well stocked. There is a bathroom, but I didn't go into it. We were able to get thru the line and up to the register easily.<//text>

Today I was in the neighborhood market on Marconi Ave. One of the employees signaled to another employee pointing at me as to say keep your eyes on that guy. Like I was going to steal something. That kind of thing has happened before in the same store. I know people do steal from that store, because I've seen them do it. But I'm not a thief, and there isn't anything that I have to steal. It's very insulting. I guess I'll have to let him, the employee, know the next time I'm in that store that I'm not the thief he obviously assumes that I am. Not all black people are criminals and thieves.< /text>

It's Walmart which means a Love/Hate relationship. Its nice to go to a store that has everything you have ever wanted, but didnt need. It's over crowded...lines are always a nightmare and the staff do not want to be there; but it does have exactly what you dont need< /Review>

Why do I always see them stoking the shelves but every single time they are always out of 90% of what I want. They are always way too busey with lines going to the back of the store and half the time I can't even get to what I want to becsuse They have their box's in the way. Also half the store is locked up and the last thing I want to do is ask some guy to unlock the case so I can get my feminine wipes</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>This walmart is one of the places that i hate most. I shopped here for almost 2 hours and when i was checking out the guy cashier rang me up and i told him to split my transactions coz i have coupons. Ended up calling a CSM which this  Customer service leader came up and doesnt wanna override the coupons i totally understand. So they cancelled the whole transaction and we had to begin again but when she was ringing me up you can tell she hated coupons the way shes slowly ringing up 1 by 1.

This is an awesome Walmart neighborhood Market. It's got everything you need from a grocery store and easy to find everything you need.  The pharmacy is quick and friendly. I love this store.</Review>

<Text>This walmart is one of the places that i hate most. I shopped here for almost 2 hours and when i was checking out the guy cashier rang me up and i told him to split my transactions coz i have coupons. Ended up calling a CSM which this  Customer service leader came up and doesnt wanna override the coupons i totally understand. So they cancelled the whole transaction and we had to begin again but when she was ringing me up you can tell she hated coupons the way shes slowly ringing up 1 by 1. Very slow.. i told her nicely maam i dont have enough time coz ive been here pretty much 3 hrs already. She just suddenly cancelled the transaction and it was embarrassing coz i was there already quite long. I asked them to call the manager and this other guy kept telling me that she was the manager but shes not coz it says on her name tag customer service leader. Obviously they dont want to call the manager, the feeling when i left here is not right i cried coz of humiliation. I was couponing for food and ended up going home wd none. I hope this wouldn't happen to anyone. The Cs leader here is a RACIST! Very rude and very not appropriate. Hate this place everytime i drove by it i can feel the same feeling i had that day.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I like this place. It's not that everything is great nor that everything is super cheap, but they have some things here that are really really good. And in many cases prices that are really hard to beat. Plus it's fast -- easy to get into -- easy to get out of.<//review>< time>

WalMart closed up in my area. Mad up all upset in myneighborhood. We started going to WalMart neighborhood store. It is over crowded in parking and in the store. Stocking is dont during the day and only one person doing it. Cant find what you are looking for. Disappointed!!! Bring back our WalMart.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I usually go to this store first thing in the morning because I don't like crowds. I realize not everyone can do that, but early morning...staff is always friendly and busy. Today though, I had to go here around noon to get some stamps, and it was crazy packed. Anyway, I was waiting in customer service when I observed a customer berating and speaking abusively to an employee because she had to wait in line.😑 The employee continued to respond professionally and with class, even after the threats. Please tell me Sharon is getting paid more than minimum wage. My 5 star is because she handled the situation better than I think most would. Keep it up Sharon.</text>< Pictures>

I actually like the store the only problem I have is that it's always too busy and there aren't enough people checking out the customers. Plus they usually end up putting long time locals out of business an individual really liked the Save Mart that closed down after they couldn't beat their prices.. Sad:(</text>

Its always well stocked and clean but mostly the variety of gender and age is a plus it seems to work extremely well at this corner store Walmart and everyone in the store plays a professional yet cheerful friendly manner .they all have a smile and always there to assist customers making shopping at walmart a pleasant experience .< /review>

Horrible everytime. Workers are so slow moving they show they don't care. 3 employees in the parking lot and one in her car on break while the only 2 registers are having back to back issues with pricing and customers. They need quicker moving employees who actually want to help.< /Text>

Stocking is dont during the day and only one person doing it. Cant find what you are looking for. Disappointed!!! Bring back our WalMart.<//text>

<review>This Walmart Store is for grocery only. Very slow lines at register. It look 30 minutes to get to the register, with only three people in front of me. All the registers were open, but all of them were going very slow. Customer service on sales floor was excellent, as prices are very good. Store was clean. Parking lot was problamatic with security that seems oblivious to happenings in the parking lot.<//review>< name>

Lacking inventory and quality of fresh products most days along with enough cashiers and cleanliness of facilities and grounds. Taylor Center has not been maintained well in the past 2 years since this store has been put in. Transients loitering in front of store and panhandling.</Text>

Had security "notified" about me scanning green onions at self check out. Got yelled at for using the barcode, even though there was NO plu to enter.

Horrible place! Always out of stock, the worst customer service I have ever dealt with and when I worked for Walmart if we EVER treated customers the way this place does WE WERE FIRED ON THE SPOT!! I Won't ever shop there again! Also, I found SEVERAL packages of OBVIOUS ROTTEN MEAT in meat department right on top and more buried under good meat. HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING PLACE!!< /Review>

Tired of the pharmacists pushing vaccines on me. They lied and said their registry said I didn't have a tetanus shot when in fact, I got one in 2013. Those shots are good for 10 years. Second, I'm pregnant and told the pharmacist I was pregnant and he didn't seem to care that I didn't want a flu vaccine.
My choice, my body. Stop trying to kill more ppl, wal mart. You already overwork those poor ppl in the sweatshops!< /text>

< Review>
I go to the neighborhood store because of the prices.  But it seems everytime I go there  is something I want that the shelves are empty.  Last night it was regular Hormel chili and Tyson 4.4lb frozen chicken nuggets.
The nuggets are normally not in the freezer and I normally buy a brand I don't prefer. Last nite I was ticked and came home without nuggets (and only one can of turkey chili). They had lots of hotttt chili.<//Review>

I stopped going here over a year ago.  Was driving by and needed a few things. Even worse than it was. Literally empty shelves at 9:00 on a Saturday morning. Now they have some items locked up just to make it even more ghetto< /Review>

<review>I never come here cause we grocery shop at winco BUT I needed a box of gloves for my caregiving job . One item . I did self checkout and thanked the self checkout Walmart lady for her help , she saw me make my perchase. On my way out the guy stopped me of all people to check my receipt. I asked him “you really going to check my receipt for a box of gloves?” He said yeah . When I got my receipt back I left , and with an attitude he told me bye . Rude and unprofessional.</review>< user>

Good location but as said by others, the prices are actually a bit higher than even the walmarts in the area. Would give it 3 stars but the workers are super nice and helpful.<//review>

<gmap_id>0x809ad97f430d01db:0xd0a7b7b4b8d17393</gmap_id><Review>I gave this store 3 stars because it doesn't carry as many of the items I was use to buying at the Watt Ave & El Camino Ave location before they closed it. They stopped carrying my favorite UV Brand Blue Raspberry Flavored Vodka at this location & they don't always have my favorite 98 cents bag of 3 White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut Cookies, my favorite red colored Hawaiian Punch Fruit Punch flavored drink, my favorite Gouda Cheddar mix Cheese or my Mike's Hard Lemonade Black Cherry. The staff is nicer & more knowledgeable & helpful here than the North Highlands location as well. I miss the El Camino Ave staff's friendliness cashiers, customer service, stock clerks & pharmacy staff. However the stock clerk Paul, all of the pharmacy staff & Dave/David and Wayne both awesome & knowledgeable older gentlemen cashiers are all the wonderful employees at this Fulton & Marconi Neighborhood Market location, but the managers are not as knowledgeable as those staff members I mentioned. I don't like the discusting cigarette smoke smell when I walk into the store, am waiting in line or walk out of the store.< /Review><Name>Julie Luco< /Name>< Resp>

The service the last 2 hrs of operation are terrible, almost no carts available because the staff uses them for stocking the few employees there at night are pretty rude across the board and the cashiers can be very rude without any provocation. All in all if I didn't get off work so late I would never shop at this location.< /Text>

HORRIBLE employees!!! Store aisles are a hazardous maze of abandoned carts (by both customers and employees), rolling 2-level ladders, stepladders, and other obstacles. Employees couldn't care less! I took pics of all the mess, which I will be sending to the corporate office along with a LONG letter of complaint. If I could give this store a negative rating, I would.</text>

<Text>This place is getting worst now that the store on El Camino Ave & Watt Ave is close, more people less cash registers even at the tiny customer service , they better think to move across the street to where Save Mart used to be...
EDITED 06/24/20 , store is trying hard to keep  stocking regularly and they added more self checkouts, it's improving,  hopefully they'll maintain that.</Text><user>116846670215169006524</user>< Pics>

<review>It’s just not Walmart Store 5230!!! It is missed in the neighborhood. Every time I’ve been to the Neighborhood Market, the selection wasn’t great, like they can’t keep the shelves stocked. But it’s Walmart product and price, and you know what to expect. It’s just a much smaller scale with some depts having minimal items. Will go back because I don’t want to drive all the way up Watt Ave!</review>< pictures>

<Review>Disrespectful  Employees, Walmart should train Employees appropriately, and inform them that certain things can lead to a store being shut down. I called in to bring something to the stores attention. I was then treated as if i was lying. I don't care about the money. Now I will be going to the FDA.

Terrible place. The parking lot is filthy, the store is crowded and the lines are long. Its ALWAYS like this. I've been to other Walmart Neighborhood Markets and they are not bad like this one.< /review>

<Review>I have top agree with a  lot of the reviews.  This store always has empty shelves. I usually don't shop here more than twice a month with my EBT. It never fails every time I've gone there in the last 3 months there's always they are lot of on my shopping list.  Very disappointed as I love the savings catcher of Wal-Mart and the other benefits of shopping at Wal-Mart. It's convenient for me so I'll be back.</Review>< pictures>

I will spend the extra money to go to real grocery store next time! This Walmart Neighborhood Market is a joke! They act like the things they're selling there are Fort Knox Worthy... So many Security checks, too much hassle for not enough product! And their prices are not that much cheaper than the real grocery stores! ... Raley's, Bel Air, Safeway! I will be shopping at the aforementioned grocery stores in the future!</Text>

<review>Small neighborhood store..needs more staff..more inventory.I like good customer service and these'are difficult times'right now but yesterday we'waited a long long time in aisle 1'while the cashier picked all the overripe strawberries from a customer's container. Then she ran to produce dept to get customer another container.

It's ok because that specific Walmart wasn't ALL THAT.... lol.

It's smaller than the other Walmarts I've been to and plus they have NO electronics and no home supplies there such as coffee makers and blenders.

Overall.... That Walmart kinda sucks</Text>

I live close by, but I rather go to Winco because they never re stock items on shelves, they never have baskets when I go, and they barely have bags, the carts are hard to push, they don't stock their produce plastics, and their produce section is always messy. The employees are not friendly and their rude. They always ignore me when I ask for a bag.< /Review>

<text>Disrespectful  Employees, Walmart should train Employees appropriately, and inform them that certain things can lead to a store being shut down. I called in to bring something to the stores attention. I was then treated as if i was lying. I don't care about the money. Now I will be going to the FDA.

Iwas there today at the check out (self check out) and looked over and saw a Cockroach crawling on the gum and other items next to that check out. I will report this to the Health Department on Monday May 20, 2019.</Review>

<Review>Walmart should be ashamed of this store. Yesterday I went there to get produce. They were out of vegetables. Many shelves were empty throughout the store. I asked if they were closing this site. The answer was “no we just don’t have enough inventory”. Hmmmm not good.<//Review>< pictures>

Ive been living a stones throw away from this Walmart for all most 4 years now and after tonights experience i will go out of my way and go up the street to the other Walmart. I went in there and grabbed a couple things as usual. I tell the girl at the checkout that i needed some ciggerates. When she comes back there is another employee standing there waiting to relieve her. She asks for my ID. The other employee says out loud ' why are you IDing him? He's old'. I have never been so disrespected like that ever in a customer service environment. If that isnt the definition of discrimination then i dont know what is. Believe it or not that is the second time in the past 2 years an employee of this store has insulted my age. The first time wasnt that bad but still unprofessional. But this time it had my blood boiling. I was shaking. I went back in the store and spoke with the manager. I explained to her that basically if he had done that in a different setting he wouldn't be pleased with the results of his actions. If you are an employee of this store i want you to understand something. The laws that protect you from discrimination and harassment in the work place are the same laws that protect the consumer. What im saying is think before you speak to a customer. If your not sure what to say then dont say anything. Not a single one of us wants to be there in the first place and that includes you so the entire situation is already socially awkward and frustrating. I look forward to speaking with customer service about this because nobody should be treated like this especially when 40% of the times i open my wallet im doing it in a Walmart checkout line.</Text>

<Text>I have paid my pg&e bill here multiple times with old bills bc all they need is my account  number on the paper. Today the girl tells me she will not let me pay it bc it's not my current  bill showing current  due date.  In the past its been made clear smude can not be late. Only pg&e whenI've goneto rancho or elcamino/watt locatons. I'm going to shop at the watt and elcamino one from now on.</Text></record>

Neighborhood Walmart is very convenient for me I am handicapped only problem is all boxes and I always mixed makes it difficult for getting products from Shelf sometimes they're right up against the Shelf which makes it unable to get what you need.< /Text>

Worst Walmart in Sacramento there’s never product on the shelf . If only I could give no stars , workers move like snails no sense of urgency when I ask where a product is they don’t even know smh Frozen food always tastes old the list goes on I’m just done with this location.</Text>
