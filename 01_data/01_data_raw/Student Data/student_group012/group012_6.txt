<Text>Maribel did an excellent job! She took extra care to make sure each acrylic nail was even.

First time at Time Out Nail Spa...... Absolutely loved it. Maribel did my nails and she is so sweet and idoes amazing work. I  feel blessed to have her as my new nail technician. The other ladies there are so friendly and the owner is amazing. I just can't believe the heart of these ladies.  This one customer really touched my heart she didn't even know me never seen me and after talking she just ask if she could give me a hug. I can't believe i never knew about this special shop.  Thank you so much Maribel i will see you in two weeks.<//Text>

I had my very first nail appointment on the 5th of November with April,
WOW!talk about meticulous! I have hard gel nails and it is quite difficult to find a nail salon to fill my nails, I had gone to one other salon and the tech was not that experienced and my nails looked sad. April did a fantastic job filling and straightening out the ugly on my nails with ease! I am so happy I found my go to nail salon! I even took a leap to a pretty nude gel polish for my french tips with a hint of glitter that I have always loved!
I still catch myself peeking at my new beautiful nails! And I have very small nail beds but that was no problem April nailed it! She's a pro! I highly recommend Time Out Nail Spa, and did I say how kind she is? Very sweet! and knows her business.   :)< /Review>

Cheyenne always has my nails looking clean and just the way I like them. I am very particular with the shape, style and look of my nails and Cheyenne is always patient with me.

The staff is accommodating and understanding with my work schedule and will go above and beyond to fit me in where they can. Once I had a conference for work and I broke a nail and needed a fix ASAP and April came back to the shop after being out purchasing supplies to fix me. The customer service at Time Out is the best I’ve ever had.

15 out of 10 I’d recommend!</text>< pictures>

So granted we got there a little late past our appointment time, my nail lady was great. However, my mother's nail tech (a blonde, didn't catch her name) was on the phone the whole time. Also told my mother she wasn't sure she'll have time to finish my mom's nails. She ended up finishing and i have no clue what glue she used but the swarovski crystals fell off my mom's nails because the glue for whatever reason didn't dry. The nails were nice--for the place but needless to say won't be coming back here.< /review>

I went there and they did a terrible job. The lady was not concentrating and kept talking on the phone and then to the other ladies. The polish’s line is crooked everywhere. I would not go back and recommend other people to go to a different salon. You get what you pay for.<//review>

Dr. Anna is the latest addition by Dr. Tanya Baker to the Calabasas Dental Spa and she did a spectacular job on my new crown.
I drive from the Central Coast to the Calabasas Dental Spa and it is so worth it!!!

Dr. Anna has done another great job on my newest crown replacement!! This is the second one in the last three months and I could not be happier!!!<//review>

The Calabasas Dental Spa has served my entire family for nearly 20 years.  It has been an investment in quality dental care for the present and our future dental hygiene.  An expert,  professional staff using the latest technologies including in house crown and bridge design for perfect fits.  Dr. Baker demands the best from herself and her staff to meet all your dental needs.  They deliver, I know they do for my family.  Warm office surroundings and staff to match.  We love them!<//Text>

<Review>I love Dr. Baker.  She's amazing.  I've always hated dentists (sorry!) but I don't really have any issues going to Calabasas Dental Spa.  Everyone is very friendly.  The place is spotless.  The equipment is top notch.  It's so nice to finally have found a great dentist.<//Review></record>

This is my 2nd visit into the office, and 3rd review for Dr. Baker and her lovely staff team. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Impeccable service, kindness, bedside manner and compassion for all patients. They take the time to understand each patient and their needs and most importantly, they are not satisfied until you are satisfied! That is the kind of dental practice everyone needs. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a dental provider. Thank you Doctor and staff!!</text>

<review>Thanks Dr. Baker for the wonderful dental service I've received since 2002!  From the beginning you have always had the most kind and caring staff as well as the most state-of-the-art equipment... That's a great combination!

And thanks for letting me show up early to use the massage chair!  Who shows up early to the dentist!!

<Review>The staff here is excellent! Beautiful relaxing office environment. I have had several procedures here, including a root canal, and just cleaning, and it has always gone well. So glad to have a dentist I can trust now.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
I cannot say enough great things about Dr. Baker and every single person in the office.  A true team who work together to treat you in the best ways possible.  Dr. Baker is an extremely patient, understanding, caring person and is the ultimate professional.  Cutting edge techniques, super clean environment, no unnecessary treatments and  deep compassion towards each patient's needs, no matter how small or unique.  I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else and I'm very grateful to have found her.  Trust is huge and I trust Dr. Baker and the office every step of the way.  After coaxing me in from not seeing a dentist in 15 years due to past horrors, again, I'm so grateful every day I'm in her care.  Go and find out for yourself, you won't be disappointed.  My fears and issues have slowly melted away and I actually look forward to seeing them.  Can you say that about YOUR dentist? UPDATE: Just had second appointment with Dr. Anna. She's a great addition to CDS. Very thorough, communicative and great sense of humor. Just another great reason to go see Dr. Baker and her team. I always appreciate the professionalism and laser-focus on making sure their patients are getting the best treatment and direction for self-care. Thank you!<//Review>

Dr. Baker always has the latest dental equipment in addition to being a true crafts-person.  When she does work on your teeth, you can barely tell there was work done because she does such a good job matching your natural teeth and making sure your bite is just right.< /Text>

Bottom line up front: the lumber price boom seems to have had little impact on this business, as the pieces I bought today were in the same realm as pieces purchased several months earlier.

They have an excellent selection of well-labeled hardwoods, slabs, and construction materials. They also offer several brands of tools, notably, Festool.

They do have some Festool products in stock, but are in the same boat as all Festool dealers in regards to shortages, etc.

That said, the sales rep seemed to have a good handle on when products would be in stock, and knew a bit of the "corporate why" as to the reason behind tool shortages.

Overall, they were friendly, knowledgeable, and offered more than competitive pricing on all products.<//review>

Fantastic selection of wood. Prices seem fair. Limited types of scrap available - couldn’t find any red oak. I suppose it’s all about the timing. Staff is very nice but limited help out on the floor.< /text>

Bill is the man: super knowledgeable, yet open to learning something new every day. Its refreshing to find anyone with 30 years in a single organization. His love of trees shows. I am grateful for the scraps, Bill - enjoy the lightning strike Englemann Spruce piece and be well my lumber brother.< /Review>

Great customer service and by far the largest selection of lumber in San Diego. Great selection of rare and specialty woods at fair prices. I purchased some beautiful figured maple from them, and I have yet to find anywhere else that carries such beautiful wood.

One note of caution: I would not have them cut a piece of wood down for you. They cut my finely planed piece of figured maple like it was low grade rough lumber, and they badly splintered the wood grain at the cut. Being a lumber specialty store, you’d think the employees would know how to make a clean cut. Guess not.</Text>

Been here twice now and it's great that they want to help you get the wood you need. When it comes to pricing though, that's a different story, you can't just ask for the price of a piece of lumber.  They have to measure it, go back to their computer, spend about 15 min finding the right code, then giving you the $/ft price and oh yeah, I forgot the original measurements so let's go measure again. Sorry but I don't trust these guys as far as I can throw them and some of them are big guys. I have friends who hate dealing with them because there's not real way of telling what the price is for wood you're buying. I guess the best thing to do is call ahead and shop around first.< /text>

I've only been once so far, but I plan on returning. The staff was very helpful. In particular the sales guy behind the front desk who was looking up pricing for me did not pick up the phone at his desk even though it rang twice while we were talking. That went a long way toward my being a return customer.</Review>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Great supply. Just what I need and more!

*No cuts* - if the piece you want is 12' you can cut it in the parking lot I guess.....

The pricing is very sketchy however. My receipt has no logic and from what I can tell they don't count the length of the wood, just the width and depth.....even that logic doesn't hold up to my receipt.

Business process is old school, hand written, weird hidden codes, questionable math. I'm sure when I return and try to buy the same cut, I'll get a different price. I'll have to bring my receipt and see the magic math play out.< /text>< pics>

<Text>The gas price at this Shell gas station is very competitive. I think it is one of lowest stations that you can find around the South Bay Area. Be aware that you cannot make a u-turn if coming from Dixon Landing freeway exit. The numbers of pumps here are limited. This place is small.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMOzsTWaeh8uINTY0GPr5zo0TR6f7MXiwKg-MZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<Text>Very clean, very cheap at this location, it’s just hard to get into because of the traffic and no u-turn.

Use the app for points on gas.
Overall my favorite place for quick gas.

Considerably better than other fuel fill up places.< /Text>< pics>

Gas didn’t come out the past 2 times I tried filling here. Tried multiple nuzzles multiple times and got annoyed. Had to go to the 76 down the street. Hopefully they’ll improve the consistency.<//Text>

<review>The people here were very helpful and overly friendly...They went beyond the call
of duty.  I would definitely go again😊.

I realize that after my initial review of the way the people here treat their customers they are still kind people obviously the kind of people to help other companies steal your money!  At least that's the way I felt after buying a speaker from this location and when three days later the speaker stopped working I was told there was nothing they could do about it!
The young lady I spoke with on the phone informed me that according to the receipt they couldn't even do an exchange.  After going over my receipt I'm still looking for that information.  My receipt clearly states you can't return sale's items that are accessories, not that you can't at the very least exchange a speaker that has nothing at all to do with phone accessories!...Grant it you bought on sale (I am on a fixed income and have to watch extremly close how I spend on such items).  This after buying another speaker from another Cricket location awhile back and it went up on me...That one at least lasted a few months.  But 3 days!  I honestly feel like I've been robbed without a gun!  I didnt want the money back I just wanted a speaker that works!  And they gave me the brushoff.
I intend to try and contact the manager with the fact that there is nothing on my receipt about finale sale items or a speaker being considered a phone aaccessory.  And let you guys know how it goes.  I believe they should be given a chance to make amends.
I'm telling you I was soo fired up I even cancelled my Cricket phone service...But I put it back cause I like the phone service...So far.  We'll see.<//review>< Name>

Great walk up stairs, and the night views are beautiful.

When you visit in the evening, Please be respectful to neighbors, noise echos into their homes.
Enjoy the climb!<//Text>

Located atop Communications Hill, San Jose’s “Little Tuscany.”  A nice place to do some cardio workouts and enjoy majestic views of San Jose. If you’re wondering why the median home price in San Jose is over $1.2 million, just climb to the top of this staircase and see.<//review>

<text>Love these stairs.  They challenge me ohysiacally and if I want I can change up the routine by walking around the hill and back to the stairs.  This can be done in 3 different spots. Top, middle or bottom. Or just keep going.  Skip a step, walk sideways, do 1 step at a time.  Keep moving, the results are amazing.< /text>< pictures>

The view was beautiful. The walk a little scary because we we're so close to the edge of the mountain. I'm not familiar with the location. But I would like to go again.<//Text>

This is a great place to do a workout on stairs, 292 steps. Everybody is friendly and it feels nice and safe at least during the day. I understand there used to be some noise and other problems at night so it closes one hour after dusk and opens one hour before sunrise.

My first time I walked it up-and-down (up and down counted as one time) 4 times at a leisurely pace and it took about half an hour. I talk to others who were doing it 6 to 12 times. My legs felt a bit wobbly right after, but I'm not to sure now. A good start! :-)<//text>

<text>When i first went to the stairs I didn't think much of them. When i got to the base of the stairs it got more Interesting. Not Until I Got To The Top Is When WoW! The View Is The Best. During the day its nice, When Night kicks in its Even Better. There's a jogging path around the Stairs.Its perfect to warm up or cool down before or after ur workout. The  air is fresh and cool it hits the spot when you need to catch a breath. The area is very calm and quiet, the people there are friendly and respectful. I go Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays around 10pm less traffic but still plenty of people.</text>< pictures>

Great people and service, nice live music, good prime rib, great historic area and so much old cool things to look at. Love sitting outside on front porch as well visit with friendly locals. Come on out from Redding you won't regret it! Plan a day at Lake then come for lunch. Amazing burger's. See you soon! Enjoy are local people and beautiful area. And don't forget pick up your trash when done. Keep are areas town and lakes clean.</review>

Really cool atmosphere, takes you back almost 100 years. The bar has beer and wine, no hard stuff. And the restaurant always has top choice beef. My wife and I had their prim rib the other night, thick cuts and cooked to perfection. If your up at Whiskeytown Lake, take just a few more minutes of a drive west to the French Gulch turn off, and it's just 3-4 miles up the road, you won't regret it.< /Text>

At the moment  you step in this place  team give you a nice feeling. Very hospitable waiters, it is a nice restaurant to hang out with friends and colleagues or with your date. Excellent  meals, qualified  chef de cuisine, decent  price and excellent  service. Warmly recommended.</text>

I like the old place because of it's historic value. With that said, my brother was visiting from Charlotte NC and the gal bartending said to him that our mother who was the designated driver and 76 couldn't have her bottled water in the establishment. Not the only dumb thing that came out of her mouth but it was the most ludicrous.  My brother didn't even know what to say to that.  If I wasn't in the bathroom when it happened she would have been told to go make love with herself, to put it mildly, and we would have left immediately.  There is a bar across the street with a VERY nice and informative bartender, she is wonderful and the bar has so many things to see inside and is fabulous. Go there instead.<//Review>

This place has high quality tires at best prices. I own a company with 11 vehicles have done my research requested several quotes throughout elk grove and galt area and by far this place had the best pricing and the best quality tires. The customer service is great! It's a locally owned family business and they value their customers. I refer this place to everyone I know! Top notch service, quality, and competitive pricing! Thanks guys!< /review>

Been going here for 5 years, and I drive 1&½ hours from my home just to get my tires done here every single time, for all our vehicles. They are amazing and have the best used tires and best price around. The owner, Sonny, is such a pleasure to talk to, I usually end up visiting long after my car is ready to go! But most importantly, he is an honest, humble man and he runs his business as such. It's such a great feeling to go somewhere where you don't feel they are taking advantage of you or just trying to make an extra buck, especially when you're a woman facing anybody in the car industry. I definitely trust this place over any.</Text>

Sonny and crew did an excellent job replacing two bald tires with reasonably priced used ones. They also do brakes and other auto repair.< /text>

Woke up to a flat tire this morning.   I already knew I had to bad tires. I went To get the flat repaired and he mention that I had to bed totters and he gave me a price to fix it but because I was on a budget when he saw that my family was in the trick he worked with me and gave me a deal and I was able to walk out with to brand used tires.

A mechanic who doesnt respect your vehicle or your reasonable requests as the owner should not get any business from the community. I had an alignment done and they did a good job. Before the work was done I requested to have the mechanics not get inside my car with dirty/oily hands because I try to keep it clean because I dont have a lot of money for another car.

The mechanics had oil and grease on their hands up to their elbows and didnt even wear any gloves. I caught the mechanic trying to get in my car after all the work was done and he just needed to get his "tools" out from the interior. His hands were still covered in grease/oil. I stopped him and asked please stay out of my car if your hands are that dirty. He gave me attitude. The office employee gave me attitude. I later found several dirty oil stains on my driver's side floor mat. Thanks for doing exactly the opposite of what I asked.

IF YOU WANT YOUR CAR TO STAY CLEAN AND BE RESPECTED BY EMPLOYEEs GO ELSEWHERE.</review>

<Review>After weeks of chasing a wheel alignment for a customers 64 chevy impala following a complete suspension and brake upgrade, the guys at ELK GROVE TIRE SERVICE knocked it out with great poise. I needed no appointment and they were ready to tackle the job as soon as i arrived. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for wheel alignment needs...<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I went in to get 4 tires and had no problems with the brakes. I leave after getting 4 tires and an alignment and all of a sudden my rear brakes are having problems. Pulled off the tires and found out that the drum had come off when tires were changed and the drum wasnt put back correctly. DO NOT COME HERE.

Needed a set of tires for my 00' Explorer, Went to "Franks" and their shop was COVERED in tire shine. They tried to sell me a set of tires that looked like beef jerky.  (-__-)  I almost slipped on my way out.   Called Up E.G.T.S. and was quoted me 40% less for an A/T.  Topped it off with an alignment and was out the door within the hour and had change for a snack. Powerful group of shops, no need to travel out of town or break the bank anymore. - Proud Elk Grove Citizen Since 1991</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Had 3 tires losing air pressure. Tire tech said to my wife couldn't find issues & that tires tend to lose psi during winter. Really?... 10 - 12 psi? She mentioned it seemed as though he didnt want to spend any more time than he had to. However, the owner insisted the tech check more thoroughly. Eventually he found 1 nail & repaired it. A few days later the tire lamp comes on. I check it today. Holy crap! 2 tires were back down to low 20s psi, and the other 2 tires the tech pumped it to 45 psi- 10 psi over!!! My wife & small children depend on the safety of this vehicle. Any of these tires could have popped had she been driving fast enough or on poor road conditions. I hope future customers read & consider this review. Also, invest in a good tire pressure gauge & periodically check the psi yourself.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809ab8caf51c2d2f:0xaca8b92e834b0123< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I brought my car in to get a set of tires they kept showing me ones with hardly any tread left on them when I went to leave they stopped me and finally showed me a good set.
It took them over an hour to do the job and they kept saying I needed a alignment which I did not. After I left the car was shaking when on the freeway. I took it to Frank's used tire on fruitridge like I should have done and had them do a balance. Found out that elk grove tire didn't even balance them. I am NEVER going to these guys again I'm going to Frank's like I always did in the past</review>< Pics>

<Text>This is my first time leaving a negative review but I feel people need to be warned. I responded to a Craigslist ad for tires and asked how much tread was left. I was told 60-70% so I drove 1.5 hours to get the tires. When I arrived the tires were 25% tread left. As you can imagine I was hugely disappointed that I was misled. I did not buy the tires and I recommend not using these guys.<//Text>< Rating>

<review>love it love it love it 😊💓 I haven't been to a hair salon years, since the last time one really messed my hair up, but I took a leap with this one and my stylist was super sweet and my haircut is perfect! Absolutely recommend!

Atmosphere is quiet and relaxed, room decor is super pretty and the staff seem to be just darling. Will visit next time !< /review>< resp>

Great Kuts is absolutely the best hair salons I’ve been to throughout my life. Julie and her sisters are the best hair professionals they are very professional and sweet. Julie and her sisters will go out of their  way to make sure that their costumers get the service they desire. Besides Great Kuts having great costumers series their prices are reasonable they don’t charge extra for a hair wash and hair styling like other places do. Great Cuts is my number one GO TO Place hair salon!!!!<//review>

I have curly hair and have had so many bad experiences I was afraid to try somewhere new.  Glad I did.... I found my new spot. The ladies really know what they are doing and are so friendly. My hair looks great and my curls are so happy!  I would definitely refer my friends and family here.</Review>

< review>
My dad has been going here for a few years and when I had to move to Sacramento to help him with his fight against cancer he took me here to get my hair cut. The very first time Julie saw my dad after his surgery I could tell she was actually upset and concerned, my dad wasn't just another haircut in and out. In todays society it's rare to get that level of customer service anymore. Not only does she care and talk with her regulars but she is great at hair cuts. One of the best at fading my hair, takes the extra time to hit the little details and every trimmed my eyebrows without me even asking. I'll definitely only go here when I'm in Sacramento.</review>

<text>My sister has been going to Kim for years and recommended her to me. Very nice lady as are the rest of the crew. Kim is the owner and has been doing nails for over 30 years. She is very efficient and precise. Both me and my daughter will be going to Kim from now on. Prices are lower than your average competition. Walk-ins always welcome. I'm all ready for the holidays with these beauties.<//text>< pics>

I was very pleased with the results. The prices were very fair, the staff were all very nice and it was convenient and quick. Nothing not to like. If you get a mani and pedi they'll do them for you simultaneously, which I love, because I'm not a fan of long stints in a salon chair. Come here!< /text>< Gmap_id>

Diane was awesome, loved her attention to detail! 20 bucks for french tips, I'll definitely be back! They said $20 for set, then $16 fills but once you come back for fills 3-4 times your sets will be free!</review>

<text>I was there yesterday and got an acrylic set. I made an appointment-still had to wait, my nails are super uneven, and kim didn't give me enough time to let my nails dry before taking another client so more than half of my nails have bubbles and need to be redone. The only time I will be going back to this place is to get my nails fixed.< /text><user>111352121535403871708< /user><Gmap_id>0x80dbe2ba80b6c7c3:0xf531bc72ca8a2732</Gmap_id>< user_name>

Just $16 for spa pedicure in nice, big new leather massage chairs. Only $3 for callous remover or sea salt. The best and longest callous remover service I have ever had! I will be back!< /Text>

<text>I have had such great service here from my 1st visit, not only that but the people are so nice and understanding to any needs..You are never afraid to tell them if you dont like something, that usually never happens to me fortunately but I know people that get a nail job done completely over because they didn't like the first coat..They do it happily and at no charge..I can be picky about my nails too..None the less, the place has a nice atmosphere and again, the people that work there are great..You can understand them too! lol</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dbe2ba80b6c7c3:0xf531bc72ca8a2732< /GmapID></record>

I went here for the first time with a friend and Kim did try her best. Unfortunately my nails were chipping and one broke in less than 4 days. i callled at 2pm to fome in at 630 she confirmed and made me wait until she finished another client she decided to book around the same time at my appointment. It was unjust and rude. She was going to have someone else do my one nail plus the ones that were chipped. I already didnt trust her, why wpuld i trust another worker. i will not go back to this place.<//text>

<Review>Appointment was at 8 for an oil change, I showed up 5 min early. Didn’t end up leaving until 10:30.

I asked for only an oil change nothing else. They still adjusted my air pressure in my tires and performed a tire rotation. I had brand new tires on the truck and had the tire pressure where I wanted it...

The mechanic was nice and told me he was never told not to. There seems to be a major disconnect at the service writer counter, so much energy In just paperwork for a basic oil change.. an oil change anywhere else only takes 15-20 min max.

I don’t think I will ever be back, too many other places to try.</Review>< Resp>

I’m from the Bay Area but needed my oil changed while I was in Bakersfield. When I arrived at Jim Burke Ford, I had to ask where to check in. Wait time was prompt to my scheduled time though. After my car was done, I entered it to a oil mess on my steering wheel. My outer car door was full of oily hand prints as well as my hood of my ST Ford Explorer. I was very disappointed to see oil on my center console as well. It took me minutes to clean it up. No respect from the technician is what I experienced. I take pride in keeping my Explorer clean and this experience was bothersome. I sure hope they did a better job to change my oil, rotate my tires and check my breaks.<//review>

<review>Have took my car in 2 times and worst time they said I needed a new engine this was about 1 year go and my engine is still running and no problems at all took it in this last time and they said my driver side emergency break actuator needed to be replaced and it was actually the passenger side.
If it weren’t for the money I would of had the things done total cost would of been about 8000$ they would of screwed me over and nether of what they said was the actual problem.
Makes me wonder how many people they do this to never going back to this piece of crack dealer.<//review>< pics>

The employees at quick lane were so nice. I had my car serviced and it didn't take long at all. I absolutely love the tv feature that shows how long until your car is finished. My car was done in half the time that was posted.< /text>

I bought a 2005 Ford F 150 4x4 and needed to repair various parts as the truck is 15 years old. Matthew Munoz and his team were amazing. There was fantastic communication from them and it came out less expensive than the quote. I will only be using them for the truck from now on. Highly recommended!!!<//review>

Once again Jim Burke Ford has knocked it out of the park. Over the years I’ve been bringing in my 2016 Ford F-250 for service at the Quick Lane on Oak Street. I also purchased my truck there as well. I have developed a friendship with the staff at the Oak Street location so when I had a problem with my truck I called the Oak Street Quick Lane. I asked to speak to Matthew Munoz, he is the person that I usually deal with. When I spoke to Matt he didn’t tell me that he no longer worked at the Oak Street location and was now at the Automall location. Mr. Munoz just took my information and was going to contact the parts department to see if the item I needed was in stock. When Mr. Munoz returned my call he set up an appointment for me with the Oak Street store. He then informed me that he is no longer working at the Quick Lane and has taken a position at the Automall store as a service writer. I’m thrilled to hear that Matthew has received a promotion. I think that this young man has been a asset to Jim Burke Ford for as long as I have been associated with Jim Burke and it’s good to see someone that I feel is so deserving get his chance.</Text>

<Text>It was quick and that’s good. Issue with the paperwork stating different oil type than called for. Service manager stated he is confident it was correct and the tech said it’s the only stuff they have in bulk. People always check the work completed(oil was clean and full). The so called car wash is pathetic but that’s because they’re just using water....</Text>< user_id>

Would have given it a 5/5 stars, but the service advisor (Jose) was very unprofessional when they mistakenly put a different oil into my vehicle. He was explaining to me that it’s recommended to put 5w-20 oil into my vehicle and that a different oil will void my warranty. I disagree with that, my owner’s manual specifically says I can utilize 5w-30 oil into my vehicle when I have my track days. The service advisor (Ida) stepped in and apologized for the inconvenience. She was very professional on handling the situation and even gave me a gift card for the inconvenience. Ida was the reason for the 4/5 rating, I would have given this a 1/5 rating due to Jose being very unprofessional. He also did not apologize for the inconvenience nor acknowledge me when I had to pay. I stood around for about 15-20 minutes to pay because Jose was ignoring me. Ida once again stepped in and took care of me. I would highly recommend Ida as your service advisor. I refuse to get serviced by Jose. Terrible experience with him.<//review>

I’m so glad my service advisor is Mathew Munoz and I’m even more glad that I get my car serviced at Jim Burke on Gasoline Alley. Every time I bring my car in for service there, I am pleasantly surprised when I get my car back. Mathew and his team we’re able to take care of me and my car quick, fast and professionally. I had a bunch of little things wrong with my car and one big thing, they took care of everything without me asking. They patched a hole in my tire and added air, they detailed my car. They made all the problems and alert lights all go away and even honored my Veterans discount. They even ordered me a Lyft to my home and then back to the dealership again. MATHEW MUNOZ IN THE SERVICE DEPT. NEEDS A RAISE AND PROMOTION BECAUSE I WASN’T GOING TO BUY ANOTHER FORD UNTIL MY AMAZING EXPERIENCE THIS PAST FRIDAY BUT, NOW I AM AND WILL BE PURCHASING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF WARRANTY I CAN BECAUSE I KNOW MATHEW GOT MY BACK! THANKS JIM BURKE FORD IN THE AUTO MALL, CONTACT ME FOR ALL OF YOUR REAL ESTATE NEEDS! MARINE COMBAT VETERAN REALTOR AT TOUR SERVICE!!!< /text>

< Review>
Update: After leaving angry, and with my car broken, I called the General Manager, George Hay. I left him a very terse message. To my surprise, he called me back within 2 hours, and agreed with me, and not only gave me a sincere apology, he made everything better. When I went in the next day, I was given great customer service, and no attitude. I must admit, they turned everything around. That's why I changed my review. I'm impressed, plain and simple.

Original post: Waited 3 hours to replace battery.
Then, when I went to leave, it appears they jostled or broke whatever ran my air conditioning/heater. Now, they literally have no idea what happened.  I cannot wait all day for them to fix what they broke, and they no longer 'loan' cars. The service here is abysmal at best.<//Review>

Went to get a new battery after work when my car wouldn’t start. Went to o Reilly’s but they couldn’t service my car Bc of the way my battery sits in my car. Went to Ford and they were able to get me in and out within 30 mins. Thank you Ford for using safety precautions such as plastic and cleaners before entering and exiting my vehicle.

<Review>We want to thank Tabitha Cox at the service counter and the service crew. Our truck broke down on the grapevine and we were stranded.  I was told on Monday 7/20/20 it wouldn't be until Friday at 1pm until they could get to my truck. Tuesday I rode into the dealership with another gentlemen who was having problems with his truck and was talking to Tabitha and I told her my situation and she said just a minute and looked at the schedule and said it would have been Friday but things got done quicker and they could take the truck now.Tabitha called back an hour later and said parts were ordered and would have them that after noon. She said it might be done that day but probably more like 10 am on Wednesday.  1 hour later Tabitha called me and said my truck was ready to be picked up. I want to thank everyone for the work to get me and my wife back on the road back to Oregon so quickly! We will keep your dealership in our places to goto for fixes in that area and tell other people if they need a dealer down there to go to you. I rate you guys five star for quick turnaround and great customer service. Thanks again Erik & Erin Hunkins👍</Review>< Pics>

Service advisor Frankie does not answer phone calls, or reply to left messages, only time he called was for when he needed second key because he managed to lock the key I gave him in the car. Does not give any updates on when or what is happening to your vehicle. Parts can arrive there and vehicle will sit weeks before any work is done. Was out of a newly purchased vehicle for almost a month. Warranty work is not important as customer pay Is my guess. I had to keep calling for updates at 3pm on Friday's and was told “next week” twice. Had to talk to Mitch, Mitch does answers phone calls and get things done.</text>

<review>They did a great job on the car. Not half the employees were wearing masks.  The dealership needs to adhere to the CDC requirements.  My Lincoln is a 2016, so they don’t offer pickup and delivery of my MKZ. It’s one year too old. I told them that I was high risk for COVID-19, but that didn’t matter to them. I don’t think that would have happened if Jim Burke were  still alive. I also have a F150. Will I buy from them again? I don’t know.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Just went for an oil change, tire balance and a tire rotation. I own a 2000 Jaguar, so when I call to get an appointment for basic maintenance services, most service departments will turn me down because they think this car is not American. It happened again.

They complicate matters. Ford normally takes it in. The vehicle actually sits on a Ford Chasis, so although it may not be an American car, it is American manufactured. Jim Burke Ford did an excellent job today!
However, the appointment setter did have to ask if they would take the car in for the maintenance services, when I said it was a Jaguar. I find it hilarious!< /Review>< pics>

First time ever to go on a Black Friday weekend... it was surprisingly calm and easy. My guy, Pedro, was professional and knowledgable to all the cars I was interested in trying. The team worked for me. I was able to afford my aviator. The financial process didn't take all day either. Thanks to Chad and Pedro working so well together . Nice group of salespeople at Jim Burke Ford and Lincoln.< /text>

Salesman JD Mealer was very knowledgeable about Lincoln vehicles and very accommodating!  We weren’t really in in the market for a new vehicle, but once we drove the 2020 Lincoln Nautilus, it was all over.
Waiting for the Finance Manager took a bit so JD helped take our other vehicles home so we could drive our new Nautilus home!
Thank you, JD, for a great experience!<//review>

The experience could have been better. They did not call us to let us know that they needed to keep our car overnight. And it would have been nice for them to wash the car. The dealership we used to go to used to wash the car every time we brought it into them! And that is the least they could have done, since we have spent $3000 in repairs at their dealership in the last month!</Review>

The waiting space was really nice.

Previously in the past I wasn't impressed with Ford service. I took my car in for 2 service issues and I can say I was quite happy with the service that was provided by my service advisor Frankie. He was professional, friendly, and quick to respond to my phone calls.  Everyone was extremely nice from the in -house rental service, shuttle driver and Blake who assisted with my car too. We have always been a 3Way Chevrolet family due to their exceptional customer service but with my recent visit Ford really impressed me.</review>

<Review>I own an F250 and I’ve always taken it to Ford at the Automall for oil changes and any issues that I’ve had with the truck, my experiences have always been pleasant but this last time around there was some issues that came up over the work that was done on my pick up which I will not get into detail Just way too much So I’ll try to make it short, I figured I would go up the chain of command to get this issue resolved I first started with the service people that help you when they write you up but that didn’t help so next I spoke to One of the managers which that didn’t work so next step I spoke to the shop supervisor that which probably is below the GM ( General manager ) Which I thought I’d probably stop there and get things resolved but Nope” he wasn’t very pleasant and non-professional so my next step was the GM , This guys name is Joe I don’t know his last name, sorry joe lol” but I’ll tell you what best  GM ever, he resolved the issue with professionalism and most of all he put the customer first” He resolved the issue like a true GM and for that I will definitely continue going back, thank you Joe 👍👍👍<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Date>1565455892549<//Date><rate>1</rate><text>Let’s see.... Where do I start? This review is only for the service department I have not dealt with the sales side of this dealership at all. So I’m July I bring my Ford F-150 in for a SERIOUS issue, my truck literally died on me in the middle of driving down the highway. The truck completely dead but my tachometer and speedometer were frozen in place. It was flashing every warning this truck possible had. Luckily for me I had a passenger who happened to start recording so I have this whole event recorded. So after coasting to the side and having to put the truck in park I was able to start it back up and get back to work safe. The truck was running rough and now every time I start it, it smokes heavily which I have a ton of videos of. Presenting this service department with all of the facts and evidence, they happily took it in but did not want to provide me with a loaner (so far the only dealership like that). I had to fight for a loaner and get Ford customer care involved. They had my truck for 2 weeks, I was told by the service advisor Frank that my truck had no codes of any kind stored in my vehicles computer, scanner found nothing, they were in contact with the Ford engineering team and they were test driving and trouble shooting my truck with them involved. Mind you this whole time I have a Ford case manager who for some reason is the one who is relying all this info to me. On the 13th day Frank calls me to tell me my truck is ready for pick up. I’m thinking great they figured out the problem and it’s fixed.... Well I was very wrong. He stated since we couldn’t recreate any of your complaints/issues we can’t do anything. Ford will not let us fix a vehicle without a reason mind you  I have video evidence on many different occasions that was shown and offered to them. Frank even proceeds to tell me they have a few customers vehicles in for the same major issue of dying in the middle of driving weather it’s on the highway, a freeway, etc. This is completely unexpected and Ford is really opening themselves up to some major issues if anyone gets hurt for this condition. Now just a few days ago I dropped my truck off at a different dealership and guess what? My truck has a crazy amount of codes stored in its computer and they said another dealership really told you this had no codes stored in it? Yes they did they said I had none. Well I guess they lied to me and I was also giving a rental no problem, no cost. They call me personally to keep me updated, amazing! It’s really sad that my local dealership service department is a joke compared to others out there and I have to travel even further to get what should be a given from a manufacturer specific dealership. I was also told by the case manager I was suppose to get another appointment arrange with the Bakersfield service department for a engine specialist to try and figure something out. Guess what Frank never told me. I was highly suggest getting a second opinion before trusting what this service department says. They have lost my trust and business.</text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>Being a Marine Combat Vet, one of the first things I notice is attention to detail, persuasion and compassion. From sleek curb appeal all the way to excellent customer service, Jim Burke Ford Automall always has me leaving with an experience like non other. My service advising manager Jason was knowledgeable, helpful as well as kind. Someone take notes on how he takes care of customers and train every associate that way, I can guarantee satisfaction. Thanks for all your help Jason and Jim Burke Ford Automall. My shocks and struts were messed up so they replaced them for me at no cost under my warranty. Thanks again folks and take care!

<review>This is by far the worst car dealership I have ever worked with. I originally ordered a truck when they told me I needed to in order to ensure production. However, I waited two months for them to tell me nothing and then told me it wasn’t going to make production, but they had the same truck in transit to their dealership a week after they said mine wouldn’t be made (it made production). Therefore, I would have to wait another 2-3 months for the truck to be made, but Ford wasn’t even accepting orders for the 2020 models at this time, so it would probably be a longer wait. The dealership did nothing to try to make things right for not coming through with their promises and only said they would match any other offers I had from competing dealerships but I needed to show them proof. Needless to say I bought my truck elsewhere and had a great experience.</review><gmapID>0x80ea6aa2cca624ab:0x2503bd8210277807<//gmapID><rate>1<//rate>< Time>

I wish I would have never brought my car to be serviced at this dealership. My car had a few issues that were being checked out by the service department. I gladly accepted a rental car as it was covered under my warranty. I looked over the car with the Ford rental person just before closing time (dark outside), but it wasn’t until I was driving the car home that I noticed the dent in the windshield (that had already been filled as it was completely smooth on both sides). I called my service department contact first thing the next morning to let him know about the windshield. After returning the car, I am now being charged with purchasing a new tire for the rental (low tire pressure warning upon return) and potentially a charge for the windshield. I am so disappointed. This horrible experience will make me never want to use a loaner car again. Let alone, buy another Ford.</review>

I have had my car at the service department on four different occasions for weeks each time.  Each visit is for the same problem and minor other issues.  The main problem is still not resolved.  I have a 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid.  The service advisor and / or mechanics never know how to answer my questions and act like the reoccurring problem is a made up issue by me.  Occasionally, the deductible is waived, but I have had this problem for years.  Time to trade in.<//Text>

Best dealership for miles!!

Recently changed my primary dealership from AV Ford due to the lack of service and quality. This place is AWESOME for both Sales and Service. The waiting room is super comfortable and modern with complementary coffee and doughnuts. It doesn’t feel like they’re trying to take my money in sales or service, they treated us like people that matter and not like ‘cattle’. Great job!!!< /Review>

Our experience with the ford at auto mall is incredibly frustrating.  No communication and trying to talk to someone there is like talking to a wall with a smiley face.  Plus there apologies are no sincere.  I've dealt with Toyota and Car Max they were way way better than Ford.  All I have to say is SHAME ON YOU<//Text>

This is the 4th ford I have owned  since 1970 this is the 1st car, the 17 Ford Focus that's had so many problems with the last 2 and a 1/2 years, it's been in the shop 7 or 8 times. I found out 6 months ago that Ford knew about the transmission problems with these Ford focuses. Ford didn't want to do anything about it because they didn't want a class action lawsuit. I will never buy another forward again. Point blank!!!!!!!!!!!!! As far as JBF they as well knew about the transmission problems because when I called I was told by one of the female service writers (oak st) " O we know about this problems with the transmission in the focuses"</Review>

<Review>I had the best experience Ive ever had at this dealership. Steven was very hospitable and nice to us! He got us a cart and drove us to the vehicles we were interested in and had knowledge of each one! He was ready to go on a test drive with us immediately and never made us feel pressured or hurried! Buying a car is time consuming but because of every ones kindness including the finance team! I was understanding and appreciated there efforts with patients! My last two car purchases where at CarMax! But it was always long and boring and crowded! I felt respected and important at Jim Burke Ford, and very happy with our Fusion plug in hybrid. I was not happy with the service department because of miss communication and miss understanding, but they made it up to me! I had dropped my old 1998 Mustang GT off on a Saturday and hadn't been contacted by them by Wednesday I had to call them! They didn't seem friendly or concerned, and I felt like I was un important to them over the phone! They apologized after I caused a seen and I asked for a sales man they pointed me towards the show room.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I dropped my vehicle of the day before my schedule. My appointment time was 10 am the following day. This was for routine services as apart of my package as well as a concern for a fan that seemed to be overheated. Upon dropping of my vehicle I asked if I would receive a phone call when my vehicle was a) ready b) needing repairs outside of the routine service, neither took place. At 5 pm the evening of my appointment, I called and was placed on hold for over five minutes to which they told me that my car had been serviced because they were under staffed. This is very frustrating as I had an appointment scheduled for some time. If I would have received a call to rearrange my schedule it wouldn’t have been a problem, I could have rearranged my schedule; however, a lack of consideration and customer service took place, and I wasn’t notified that my car would be kept another day. When I went to pick up my car, neither of the representatives greeted me or stated it would be a moment. They were just discussing how another employee hadn’t shown up in a few days and how they wish they could do the same. The mechanic then told another person in my party that it was ok just to take the car. I didn’t sign any paperwork. This was also upsetting that the loose ends weren’t handled.</Text><user>104055119498971164265</user><username>Shaniece Williams</username><rate>1< /rate></record></dataset><record>

This was an emergency stop during a vacation to Bass Lake. The dealership was amazing and got everything done timely so our vacation and return to home/work wasn't interrupted. BONUS: they even did a safety recall for me without even asking them to AND they made sure to double check warranties so as not to overcharge me. Frankie and his Techs are truly fantastic!</Text>

I had a cheek engine light on. Was given a time frame for the work needed to be done and it was done sooner than expected. Was given a call as soon as it was completed. Great customer service from all involved from first coming into the service area to the end of me leaving.< /Text>

<text>This was the worst experience that I have had with a car issue.  The people that I talked to were pleasant so that was ok.  They took five and a half weeks to repair the car of which four of those weekend were just to look at it and figure out the issue (transmission needed to be replaced) - this is just unacceptable service.  The other issue was a lack of communication.  I pretty much had to call them every time to get any information and there was a one week period where I could not get a return call - this is also unacceptable.  I will be sending a letter to both the dealership and to Ford</text><response>{'time': 1561656388367, 'text': 'Lisa, thank you for sharing your experience.

I always have a good experience when I bring my car in. I would like to make special mention of Tabitha. She makes every experience pleasant. She is friendly and professional. Today, I found myself hoping she was there to help me through the process. She was and did not disappoint. Great experience.</Text>

<Text>I’ve had to take my car in twice this year. The first time my car was there for nearly 6 weeks, the second time it was there for 3. The second time my car sat for two weeks without even being diagnosed, and I didn’t get any calls with information or updates on the status of my car unless I called first. Wouldn’t take my car there if not for the costs being covered by warranty.<//Text>< Pics>

I normally visit the JB on Oak. But since changing jobs the location closest to my home (Gasoline Alley)was more convenient for this visit. I had scheduled an appointment for a oil change and safety recall. Upon arriving I was greeted and assisted almost immediately. Frankie Lopez was my Advisor for this visit. Something I like that the Oak street doesn’t do. A designated person to assist you. Frankie gave me an ETA and since I needed a shuttle he asked me to wait inside and that the shuttle service would begin at 7:30am. Side note, this location is very nice, clean and welcoming. Anyway, I figured I was in for a long wait since shuttles are are never on time. But low and behold, at exactly 7:30 I was greeted by Michael. He was super friendly and got me exactly where I needed to go. I even found out we’re from the same hometown! Anyway, half way through the day Frankie contacted me to give me an update on my vehicle, something I greatly appreciated. A couple of hours later I was contacted again to inform me that my car was ready. Upon arriving I was greeted again by a team member, Frankie then arrived to go over a few things before sending me on my way. Afterwards my husband and I were outside looking over my vehicle and noticed that it had been washed! Something the Oak street location has never done. Frankie saw us outside talking and stepped out to ensure everything was okay. We told him it was and we’re in our way. Thank you JB Gasoline Alley Team! You get an A+ for service!

<Review>Worse service I have had in years.  Took longer than stated and we had to call for updates.  I wish My old Service Advisor was still there. I will think hard before going back to Auto Mall.

Sept 17, 2018 update.  My check engine light came on so I tried Ford Auto Mall one more time.  Needed them to check code but had to have my truck back by COB.  Frankie did a great job.  Said it would be a wait but if I got it in right away (before lunch) they should be able to check the code.  He call and let me know mid afternoon it was a "lean" code but could not find it.  So cleared the code and got my truck back by 5:00.   Thanks Frankie<//Review>< Pics>

Gave 4 stars only because I don’t know if they fixed my problem yet. I didn’t like that they made my appointment 2 weeks out when I called originally. They really couldn’t explain to me what the problem was and why, but my truck did need an update. They have great customer service and seem to operate smoothly. If my problem with my truck happens to be fixed I will change to a 5 star review.<//text>

I'm sorry but you guys at this location needs to figure out some different.  I went in on Friday (walk-in) and this is the only express lane service where no one comes out to greet you and take your information.  I did not know that since this is my first service for my new vehicle.
After waiting for 5 or more minutes, I left.
I returned the next day on Saturday morning and I was the first person waiting.  Two more people pulled up, one next to me and another behind me.  They both understood to get out of their vehicles and walked inside and were serviced before me.  That is when I realized, you have to walk inside and check in with an advisor.  No one does this besides this location.  There are no signs anywhere advising you to walk inside.
When it came time to pick up my truck, no one called telling me it was ready.  Given it was a Saturday, there was only one service advisor working and when I came to get my truck, no one was around to get checked out.  There were parts cashier, in fact I couldn't find anyone in the dealership, maybe one guy in finance.  I saw a family sitting down at a table, waiting for help?  Not sure but it was painfully obvious that we were all waiting for help to get on with our day.
Otherwise the price and the speed of the service was great.  Too bad the customer service is not great.  I wish the service was like Bill Wright's service.  They have it down to a fine art, even the new service center is running flawlessly.< /Review>

Had it towed to Jim Burke Lincoln Mercury after calling Jim Burke on oak st and girl in service was very very rude. Frankie was my advisor and he was awesome. Car was towed Wed night and he had car back to me by 2pm Thursday... If you use Lincoln Mercury please ask for Frankie. Great customer service..

<rate>3</rate><userid>107134682188368439043< /userid><Text>I was a disappointed when I was informed that my wipers needed to be replaced. And it would cost me $40. I spoke to the quick service advisor  told him that I  could not understand why my wipers needed to be replaced when I had purchased my 2016 Escape at the end of September 2018.  His response was that wipers only lasted 6 months. (not true). I was under the impression that when I purchase a car from Ford New or Used all parts were inspected. I mentioned that I had purchased Service and Part replacement at time of purchase. My wipers were  replaced at no charge. I haven't had a chance to read the conditions on my terms as to how many set of  wipers I will be eligible for. So now I'm wondering if I've already used up wiper replacement  eligibility .  The wiper situation only reminded me that , 2 days after my purchase, I was on a road trip to Fresno from Bakersfield. My low tire light indicator turned on. 2 of my tires were low. Luckily I pulled into a service station and a gentleman helped me at that time. I did complain to the sales man when I got back into town. He said he would look into it.  I'm just glad it was in the morning and not at night.  I get the Quick Service dept. But I miss that Customer Service you use to have. My first purchase from Jim Burke Ford was a  1970 Fiesta.  I've always purchased New Vehicles from you. Escape, Edge and now another Escape. This is my first Used car. Hope I won't be disappointed.
Just my opinion. You asked for it.

Was quoted 3-4 hours for an install on a part.  My car was in the shop for 4 days from my appointment time.  Had little communication from them and ended up spending more than planned on additional transportation for myself since my car was there multiple days longer than expected.  Zero compensation for the extra time wasted and hardly any apology.  What is the point of having an appointment if your car sits there for 2 days without being touched?<//Review>

My service advisor, Lindsay, was thorough, knowledgeable, and a delight to work with. I am from San Diego and my air conditioning had some trouble on the way to business meetings in Bakersfield. Lindsay was patient in explaining the problem and how it would be resolved. I am indeed thankful for the terrific service and conscientious work of the folks in the Jim Burke Ford Service Department!

Had to get towed from Tehachapi as computer died and my local guys couldn’t fix  met with Jason service mgr next day  he was the hero of my experience as I went into hospital next day diagnosed problem and got to work while I recovered from surgery.  Had to locate replacement computer  got it shipped in at a discounted price which he passed along to me.  Jason was superior at communicating with me and my wife while I was hospitalized and in recovery. Service was excellent Jason was excellent  no reservations about Burke Ford service<//Text>

When I made the appointment for my truck, I was asked if I had any other issues. I informed the person who made the appointment that my oil pressure gauge would drop intermittently at idle. I assumed the reason I was being asked was to see if I was having issues related to the recall. I wasn't asked or advised about having my vehicle diagnosed and I certainly wasn't informed of a $130 charge. I am extremely unhappy with my experience. I plan on calling in to speak with a manager.< /review>

Drive in lane needs an evaporator cooler.  Nice new area but ceiling too low and traps in heat.  Service personnel very nice.
10/5/18 Today very poor service.  Even though we have a Ford, this location doesn't seem to know how to work on F350 duallys. When ready they hadn't checked the tires, so back it went. Then when they said it was ready, they had not checked the inboard tires, nor the spare. Then they never checked the brakes which is part of their service and didn't tell us.  Part of their answer was they were using the wrong paperwork which compounded it. Both forms show a brake check; so right now I don't know the brake condition of our 74K mile, 16 yr old vehicle. Initially our appointment was for smog check, we were told it would not pass (it has never had a problem in 8 yrs we have owned the truck); turns out they were reading their manual wrong and there was no problem.<//text>

Great service department! Used quick lane for an oil change and the my Ford Mustang was in and out. Highly recommend the quick lane at the Automall Jim Burke Ford Lincoln dealership in Bakersfield, Ca! Friendly staff!

<review>First time going to the ford dealer at the auto mall.
Should of stayed with the oak street store.
Had a oil change and tire rotation. Got home and notice the tires had not been rotated. Let me explane. Its 98% that you are going to have more brake pad dust on your front wheels then on the back wheels. Been driving my truck for four years and I know my truck.
My truck had not been washed in almost a month so there was dust on wheels. Front had red dust from the pads rear had road dust.
I ask the manager to explain he couldn't, when they did rotated the tires I pointed out to the manager that the tires now had hand prints as they did not before.
I will not go back to that dealer at the auto mall. Will continue to take my business to oak street dealer.<//review>< pics>

My service experience at Ford was great. From scheduling my appointment, that was made for the same day, to bringing my car in made me feel like I was in great hands. All of my questions and concerns were answered with no problem. My service Advisors name was Roger Lara at the auto mall location and he was the best. Thank you Mr. Lara for making my family and I feel comfortable while service was being done on our car and for keeping us informed along the way.

To start this off I dealt with Lindsey.
Lindsey is really professional every question I had she was able to answer and she explained everything that I needed to know about my car.
The reason why I dropped my car off was because my a/c wasn’t blowing cold air but they checked out my whole car, they found that my brakes were at 2mm and my rotors were bad and couldn’t be turned. After I approved, Ford completed the brake job and replaced my rotors. Ford only charged me for the brake job and they paid for my rotors. I have CarMax  extended warranty and Lindsey  dealt with that for me and I only had to pay the  deductible for all the AC work. They also allowed me to pick my car up after hours. Jim Burke is a great place to drop your car off to get work done.</Text>

I had my trick in for repair which Jim Burke mechanic said I needed a new transmission. I waited three weeks for the repair to get completed.  I spent 4,700 dollars and picked up my truck Monday the 28th. Tuesday 29th while at the coast for business and my truck started having the same problem. Not the transmission that I just spent 4,700 dollars on.
Bad customer service to boot.My truck sat there for 3 weeks you think they would have changed the oil because of it sitting for so long, they did not. My truck is now sitting at the coast. They did give me a rental until my truck is fixed. Worst experience every.<//Text>

I visited Jim Burke Ford on 11/23/20 to address an oil leak. Was told the oil pan gasket needed replaced.
Also I am just a bit over 100k miles so a service was suggested.
They test drive the truck and upon return to the service center, they noted the water pump was leaking profusely. This was going to be another +$500.00. They agreed that it was not leaking coolest prior to the work but still wanted me to pay.

If I broke your vehicle while I had it, I would fix it for you.< /review>

<Text>I went to go check out a Ford cause I have in other towns, and we went an hour before the store was closing but the sales person Sam kept saying were closing. Were closing like he wanted us to leave. I also couldn't remember what trim level the ford was that I was looking at so I kept asking questions and he just pointed out the Escapes to us and told us to go look at them and he went back inside. I still didn't know what trim level it was. So when he finally came out and got us we went inside and he asked what stuff we thought were important and he said he would call us back on Monday. (Which it has been over two weeks now) and I still haven't heard from him. I didnt feel welcomed at this dealership at all. He just wanted us to leave it was very uncomfortable<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea6aa2cca624ab:0x2503bd8210277807< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This isn’t the first time I’ve been here to have my car serviced and it won’t be the last. I called and talked to Frankie Lopez who I’ve dealt with before and he got me in right away without an appointment !! I was in and out in an hour!! These guys do a great job and I’ll keep coming back. Thanks Ford (auto mall) :)< /review><UserId.>117330699003194830951<//UserId.><response>None< /response><Name>Nick Hernandez</Name>< Rating>

Experience was horrible i have had my truck at the shop for the same issue multiple times. The last time i had it in there some of my belongings went missing out of my truck. The service manager was very unhelpful and told me i was out of luck that there was nothing he could do. Will never return to this dealership< /Review>

< Review>
Very prompt and courteous service, from both the service shop and the car rental agency. My F350 needed to have a defective transmission temperature sensor replaced, and the repair (which required dismounting of the transmission) was completed the day after I brought it in. I am disappointed by the Ford product (three repairs caused by defective sensors on this ten year old truck, two exhaust and one transmission), but the repair work was excellent, and the truck's shifting is now much smoother.< /Review>

The clear coat applied and the overspray was taken off so the car now looks like new also had the alarm installed so hopefully the car is now safer. Jim Burke Ford was great giving me a loaner car while my car was being serviced. I think our next car will have EcoBoost that was pretty cool driving.< /text>

<review>That place is like a ghost town. The 3 times I've gone to have my car serviced I had to look for someone to help me, I wasn't greeted right away like other places. Their customer service isn't pleasing and needs work.  They didn't fix the main complaint I went in for but found other repairs needed, so when I took it back it was written as a problem that came up after my initial visit. I didn't get charged, but come on, if you messed up just apologize and make it right. The place is nice but friendly, smiling & welcoming faces would make it better. Their lack of customer service makes me not want to go back to that location which is closer to where I live.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Quick in and out service, brought truck in for a recall and an oil change, within 3 hours called back to tell me truck was done.

The bad is the price of the oil change via Quicklane, it was 69.98, I was like what about the 39.98, and was laughed at....</text>

<Review>Took truck (F-350 DRW) in for inspection for ext. warranty. Multiple items needed attention. Truck was still under warranty, Chris, service advisor at Auto Mall location made sure all items under current warranty  and a couple items not covered were repaired in a timely matter and the charges I paid were explained to me beforehand.  Chris was very reliable and notified me of any delays that came up.Chris was very friendly and made sure I fully understood everything. I will definitely return if I have any other problems and Chris will be the advisor I go to. THANK You!!</Review>< pictures>

I went in and told them what the issue was since it was inspected by another Ford dealer near San Jose, this ford dealership charged me $125 for an diagnostic test and wanted to charge me $500  for 2 valves I didnt need although my car was under FULL WARRANTY.

Ford Focus wasn't covered on an automatic dual clutch transmission that now has class action suits. They expect me to pay for replacing defective parts. I have owned Ford since the Escort. Now, I will never buy a Ford again, and I will tell ALL my friends and family what happened to me.</Text>

<review>I am really diatisfide with the service this time, one of the main concerns or issues with my car was not resolved the car continues to vibrate at high speeds.
Another thing that bothers me is the lack of communication among the people in the service department some called me to give me an update on the status on my car after several atemts from my part to find out rI requested to relay a message to my advisor, they never passed the message, this created more confusion and stress on me. My car continues to vibrate at hig sppeds, the main complaint was not resolved.< /review>< pictures>

I came to the ford service section to set up an appointment for my recall that should of been done a year ago at ford on oak st. on my driver side airbag on my 2013 gt500 and left not needing to set an appointment because at gasoline dr they did my recall right then and their not needing to set an appointment and now I feel safe driving my car around knowing my airbag won't kill me on impact and I'm definitely coming here now to get all my parts and services than the ford at oak st. Which we're being rude and not letting me get my recall done on my car< /review>

<text>This service department is a joke. I took my truck to get a oil change and after it was done I checked the oil and it was as black as when it went it. But now with a bunch of oil all on top of the engine and under the hood. I went back in and told the service advisor about the oil being pitch black and he argued with me saying all the diesel trucks oil is black and that’s how it is. Completely unprofessional</text>< name>

Went in because my truck seat wasn’t functioning properly and I needed the Sync and Nav updated (last Nav update was 1/15)... 3 hours later my seat was totally broken and now barely driveable as it is reclined so far. Additionally, I noticed when I got in, it recognized my phone... odd if it was totally upgraded... looked at Nav and it still showed 1/15. 3 hours of my life wasted and got my truck back in worse shape than when I took it in.<//Text>

<Text>I took the truck in for a oil change and tire rotation. When I got home I noticed the hub caps were on the front and supposed to be on the back only on a 4wd. I also checked the oil level and saw the oil was black like it hadn’t even been changed. So I looked underneath the truck at the oil filter and saw black oil running down the filter dripping on my driveway. The dealer is less than 2 miles away so there is no way the oil should be black like that. I don’t think they even changed the oil just the filter</Text>< user_id>

<Review>Service dept is a joke... I will never take my truck back to this location. I think autozone has more knowledgable employees. It baffles me that some of these people are employed and call themselves professionals. I stand by ford trucks, but this service dept needs an overhaul of new employees.</Review>< pics>

But thanks to you neither were true but it was worse my little Ford fiesta had a broken right stearing arm something that definitely was dangerous but you had it replaced in a day u are all WONDERFUL thanks so much

<resp>None< /resp><Review>I am satisfied with the work that was done to my car.  I am very upset and dissapointed on how long it took for my car to be ready and how unprofessional Jason Mcley was.  I spoke with him on 07/31/2017 to schedule an appointment to get my car fixed he scheduled me an appointment for 08/07/2017 but told me to bring my car in on that week of August 1st and in they could get to it sooner they would.  I took my car in 08/01/2017 and didn't hear back from him that week so I figured my car couldn't get worked on that week and it was ok since my appointmet wasn't till the 7th.  Next week came by I didn't hear from Jason I called and left him several messsages and he never returned any of my calls.  I decided to call the service center on the 11th and finally someone got Jason on the phone for me.  He told me that my car had just gotten diagnosed that day the 11th and not the 7th as I was scheduled.  He explained the problem with my car and told me he had ordered the part needed as urgent and that it should arrive by the 14th or the 15th and my car would be worked on right away.  You would've thought he would've had the courtesy to have returned one of my calls all week and offered my a loaner car but no he didn't.  I waited till the 16th to give him time to get back to me he never did when I called of course he didn't answer my call or returned my calls.  I once again called the service center on the 17th and was able to speak with Mitch he told me that the part was ordered and they were just waiting on it once I explained what was happening he managed to find a part and was able to get it delivered for the next day and have my car worked on as soon as the part came in.  I didn't get my car back till the 21st and the only reason why I got it back was because I was so upset that when I called that morning they still couldn't tell me if my car was ready or not so I showed up in person to get my car back.   Needless to say I hope I don't have to return here ever again.</Review><Date>1503682052009</Date><userid>107321238401127914905<//userid><Pics>None</Pics>< username>
