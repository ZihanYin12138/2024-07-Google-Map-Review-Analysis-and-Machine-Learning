My Family of 5 goes to Kirby & Florida Dental Group, even my 4 year old! I recommend them to everyone and even if you have fears of the dentist, like I do. Dr. Ibrahim is so gentle and makes us feel at ease. My oldest son is also seen for braces on the weekend which makes it convenient for us. Thank you for always taking care of my family and taking the stress out of it.< /text>

<text>I can't wait to go back! I never thought a dentist would help me with my anxiety. I mean who doesn't get anxious going to the dentist? I told them I was feeling that way and they talked me through it. I've been going to this office for several years and every time I go it's an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this office!!</text>< rating>

Called on a Saturday for my 22 yr old son bc he woke up with an abcessed tooth, and they made time in their busy schedule for him.  He was in severe pain and his whole face was swollen clear up to his eye.  The receptionist who took my call was caring, quick acting and she could easily have brushed me off as is so often the case when a situation like this happens on a weekend.  Thank you Dr. Ibrahim<//text>

<review>The staff here is wonderful , I have had a dentist phobia since I was a little girl and have always been afraid to even enter the dental office! The office is so welcoming and they all make sure to make you feel as comfortable as possible! I didn't think I would ever be able to face my fears but Dr. Essam Ibrahim has the magic touch!!!! made me believe I was tougher than I ever thought I could be!! I will be forever thankful for all my experiences here at this dental office, and will continue to  come here for all my dental work.</review></record></dataset><record>

I initially took some kids that were in my care at the time there. They were very clean, professionally and friendly. They became my family dentist. I  also referred my sister, now it's her family dentist. I would recommend them to any family. They do great work, and are great with all ages.<//text>

This is a great dental office.  I have a ton of anxiety about going to the dentist, and their staff made me comfortable and relaxed.  My treatment was more than I could afford and took the time and walked me through their iCare financing program.  It was affordable for my family, and they were super-efficient about everything.  I highly recommend.</Review>

I was so dreadingly, terrified to come here relocating to another state and finding another provider is scary but, each dentist here knows exactly what they are doing, they are quick and get the job done perfectly, for a perfect smile. My family loves this place.< /Review>

Bottom line .Needed 5 minures of dentist time receptionist said he's leaving soon. Didn't even bother to ask. Was referred to him by someone who has seen him over 10 or more years. I'm high Anxiety took a few to go inside. Thanks for caring.<//text>

Very unprofessional & the office manager gives a lot of attitude I believe her name is Lydia . Was very deceptive when she convinced me my daughter needed braces a few years ago. Promised me certain things would be done with her ortho treatment and now that her braces are paid off almost four thousand dollars later, now these promises are being broken. I feel bamboozled & lied to. All 4 of my children were their client & now I will be finding a new dentist to service my family. Apparently there’s no regard for good customer service & professionalisms.< /text>

<Review>I went to a lot of dental offices and never ran into one that did a half as job. That was until I went to this one, I had my fillings done there then got told by another dentist that they weren't close to being properly done. On top of that they are way too expensive like honestly $300 for cleaning is not worth it.< /Review>< pictures>

Dr. Hashem has been my dentist for 15 years . He is like a son to us and I trust him . He is ethical and kind. Dr. Ibrahim has been my go to dentist also. He did an amazing job with my tooth implant. Everyone in the office is helpful. We recommend Kirby and Florida to all our friends. P.S. we live in Murrieta and we will not go anywhere else. Lois and Ron< /Review>

Kirby & Florida have been our dentists, orthodontist, hygienists, technicians, and office personnel for YEARS! Best dental office ever according to our family of eight. They are a professional, yet fun-loving, and considerate bunch. Come on, my kids have respectful nicknames for their dentists!</review>

< Review>
Third time is NOT a charm!

On my first visit, the dental hygienist gave me a deep cleaning. Before the cleaning, he numbed my gums but did not wait until my mouth was entirely numb before beginning the cleaning. Since he did not wait until my mouth was numb, the cleaning hurt more than it should have. My second visit was satisfactory. My third visit, however, was far from acceptable. The front desk employees were very rude. I waited over an hour for my appointment, never called back, before eaving the facility. Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to this dentist</Review>

< review>
Over zealous on the reviews, must be employee paid reviews. I walked in as an emergency, no appointment. I have a cracked tooth and it’s abcessed and bleeding. I’ve now seen 7 patients go back including one patient who was an hour late to her appointment. When the receptionist was advising the dentist that I am in severe pain, he replied “too-bad he’s gonna wait” now how professional is this? I am in the industry of customer service and by far this might be the worst behavior and care for individuals who are actually bleeding in there mouth. I have now been waiting for almost 2 hours, I might be a bit impatient but this is just cruel and not right at all.<//review>

<Text>I have never been more satisfied at a dental office as I am withthis dental group. the staff is very nice and gentle yet very professional. they explain very thourough what they are going to do, as well as they are very very intellegent at what they do.
I have never thought that any dental office will give me a very pleasant experience but they did. I am no longer afraid of dentsts and dental offices. thanks to the Kirby and florida group. front desk staff very polite and professional, Dr Ibrahim essam was very gentle and new what exactly I needed before I even told him my issues. his assistants and the dental higinist were very courteous and professional. Dr Essam Ibrahim is a very great asset to this group. he is the most polite, gentle and kind Dr I ever met. Im sure the rest of them are the same cuz the atmosphere was very friendly and professional there.
In simple words, the experience and the staff were great and I am recommending everyone I know to go there. God bless you all

<rating>4</rating><Text>Super cute and trendy coffee shop and cafe. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Didn’t try the food, but the baked goods looked delicious. Got a cappuccino. It’s served in a satisfyingly heavy glass. The milk was perfectly pulled with velvety micro foam. The shot left something to be desired. I forgot to check where their beans are from, but I wasn’t impressed. It tastes very lightly of milk chocolate with a slight tang, but without the accompanying fruitiness I expect with a lighter roast. The finish tasted like old, wet grounds. None of the toffee or nuttiness I like in a darker roast, but also none of the more herbal notes you get from a tangier espresso.
There’s a nice little seating area in the back, but it’s better for a brunch date than to work on a screenplay.
Solid third wave coffee with hopefully just a bad day on the espresso machine.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU6FrDJ1JU_cBTPyj0eaxRChWDFRklqYqhOA7q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdU9JPno3Mba0_1tBMi_bWMMTHd1C5pIo_LIuh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMefi8VvLhDgPMUR61Cl6HdDwicsXAD3P8unr-0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCjinHhVfVLaqzZqBZ7ns18iJbXgr4o-_zlg4E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

This location is small, but they have seating both inside and outside. The lattes were quite good, albeit a bit small. The avocado toast was a lovely rendition of this ubiquitous California breakfast option. The bread was particularly delicious. The biscuit was very tasty but way too much money for the size of the portion. $7 for one biscuit is really ridiculous, no matter how good it is.< /review>

<Review>Quirky food offerings, expertly prepared.  Very, very solid.  Good coffee... expensive experience (noticed they just raised some prices, which are beginning to cusp to San Francisco standards), but high quality.  Open air seating only.  They have a strange policy of keeping the sugar and cream for coffee behind the counter. A bit irritating. Just put it out where everyone can see it — where everyone has access to it.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2c5a8924f1b93:0x94de993a5b40e6c0<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

They have good food and friendly staff. Sometimes the coffee doesn't taste strong enough, but maybe that's relative to how tired I am? Haha, I really love this place. I try to spread the love around various places on Figueroa and this place is always in the rotation. Some favorites are the oats and chickpea frittata. Have had both many times and always super good. The pastries are always fantastic as well.< /Review>

Cute coffee place. I really like the name.
Maybe an homage to South Pas high school?

The waffle and eggs on biscuits were excellent.
Seating is a bit limited, but get friendly on the benches.
The deco is cute and definitely a nice place to visit.< /Text>

<review>I LOVE THE NEW BURGER. I think it’s my new guilty pleasure. Everyone here is friendly and helpful to answer any questions you may have. The food and snacks are amazing. Unfortunately some of my favorite menu items have been removed or replaced but they’re all tasty. The meal prices are up there but understand this isn’t prepackaged Starbucks food. The menu is short sweet and to the point and is also available in Spanish. I know a lot of people are intimidated by the bar style service but that’s how it works here, I assume because it’s so small.
From my experiences: Be patient when it’s busy and kind to them and they will be very sweet to you. My bonus, There is a nice covered seating area in the back of you feel like hanging out. The clothes they sell are cool too. I love that there are Dodgers bobble heads everywhere.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Really great coffee and pastries. Fun environment and really excellent/kind baristas. However I wish it wasn't so expensive and also it is so loud in there constantly. There is usually 2-3 songs playing at the same time from all the restaurants in that building...just chill it out in there.<//review></record>

< Review>
I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at Go Get Em Tiger on our interview date.

Go Get ‘Em Tiger has come to be known as a beloved L.A coffee chain with roots in many foot traffic heavy neighborhoods. Opened in 2018, the Highland Park location found a home in a cute little small business cul-de-sac style building on the illustrious Figueroa Street, accompanied by Triple Beam Pizza and Highland Park Wine. Sound the alarm! You can get coffee, pizza AND wine in the the same hub!

Anyways, due to sharing a space with other businesses, GGET HP’s shop size is a bit smaller than some of their other locations, but that’s not to say that they don’t utilize their space to its fullest potential. A clean color palette of white and their signature light blue paired with luscious green plants hanging from the ceiling and light, warm wood display shelves (which also include plants and coffee making items). Plus, they have a cute indoor patio area for happy customers to enjoy their delicious coffee and healthy noms (if they don’t want pizza of course). All in all, the GGET team has done it again with a lovely location for locals to enjoy.< /Review>

Confusing,  wasn't sure what or where to sit, or place order, wait for host.  I had to initiate with worker at counter on where or who takes order.
32 dollars for two breakfast burritos. Nope, definitely not again.< /review>

<Review>GGET is an LA staple, and this new spot in Highland Park is no exception. Truly superb coffee, not to mention the great baked goods and breakfast items. Location has lots of indoor/outdoor seating as well< /Review>< user_id>

Nothing out of the ordinary... Espresso blend under roasted as is the case with most LA coffee shops and consequently tasted flat  and on the tart acidic side. If you are used to full city/Italian roast levels which would allow more caramelized flavor, you may actually like McDonald's espresso better. 🤷‍♂️<//review>

Really dig this place for working. They've got free, passwordless wifi, great coffee, and ample seating. I'll note that the seating isn't entirely indoors which, because it's LA, is totally fine almost all of the time. There were a couple days this summer that I found myself pretty warm and I can imagine it gets chilly in the winter, but I'm not one to complain about our almost perfect weather in Southern California. The space is shared with Triple Beam (my favorite pizza in LA) and Hippo--also just a very hip part of HLP.

I usually just stick with the coffee and cold brew here, both of which I like. I've gotten the Business & Pleasure one as well which has three little fun coffee and tea drinks, but honestly is maybe overkill for my needs. They've got some breakfast-y foods that I haven't tried (because pizza), but it's nice to know they're available. Parking is easy and free on the side streets off Figueroa. Lovely addition to the neighborhood!< /review>

Yum bun and fizzy hoppy teas are a must and stand-out items compared to comparable shops. All of their breakfast and coffee is expertly prepared and delicious. The staff knows all about the coffee and pull some delicious shots. Highly recommended!</Text>

Quite a hip place at highland Park area, with seating area and tables shared with the next door pizza place. Coffee is ok, served on Mason jars if for done in. To go will use regular to go cup glasses. Still using plastic straws which is better for those who like to drink their drinks slowly where paper straws tends to dissolves in the drink or becoming soggy unusable straw after a while not finishing your drink. Food is kinda on expensive side which also drink too. Mocha is 6.5 a glass before taxes. Breakfast sandwich is one of the recommended, but gosh, on the sausage, they are way way too much fennel seeds on the meat. Way too abundant that ruin the meat taste completely.<//text>

In an area with several excellent coffee shops within a few blocks, GGET stands out—for the consistent quality of its espresso & drinks, its snug covered patio seating, its design, and its small but amazing food menu. The waffles? Incredible. The Huevos Rancheros? Delicious. A must.< /Review>

Had a service request on Monday morning. Oscar did an amazing job. He was on time. Very Professional. Very quick. He fixed the service issue without hassle. And if I could give him extra points I would, as he also replaced a couple light bulbs while he was here as well. :) Much appreciated. Thank you!<//Text>

< Review>
I really enjoyed everything about The Village Mission Valley. There are a wide variety of home types, a great amount of space, and the amenities are top-notch! To me, though, the star of it all is Sarah Stanciu. She put forth a lot of effort to get me to look at many different unit types, and answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly! Additionally, the work she did for me expanded beyond just the Village, but also to various other Irvine Co. communities in Mission Valley. I can’t recommend this enough, if not just for Sarah’s fantastic service alone.< /Review>

Unfortunately, this is what they think is high quality apartments. Picture speaks by itself. There is a hole in my cabinet under the kitchen sink which causes my  apartment to have mice 🐁 and others insects often running around the kitchen. We called the maintenance on the 25th of July, but so far nobody has came to close the wall and the hole around the pipe, they sent a pest control company instead to place some mouse traps in my cabinets. Such a nightmare!!! Not even mentioning the high price we pay for rent to share the space with mice 🐭<//review>

Management will go against the terms of their own lease to obtain more money from you, especially after move out. I personally was a great tenant at this beautiful, but corrupted complex enjoying my paid on time apartment before and during Covid-19. They revoked all amenities during Covid without compensating the residents. They refuse to pay referral checks to tenants after all said paperwork is done. The complex is infected with Giardia which I got from pets on the grass. There are no security cameras protecting the residents vehicles, and vehicles have been stolen from the garages. The Village, still owes me money and their Procrastinating tactics are in hopes that you forget about it.< /text>

<review>Hello, I am a current resident. I have been calling the office for two weeks now and no response! PLEASE CALL BACK!!! I have also been sending messages in the resident portal with no response. PLEASE RESPOND!!!
I am VERY frustrated at the lack of attention for the residents. I understand we live in a pandemic, two weeks is more than enough to reply especially with something as time sensitive as a lease!

I don't want a GENERIC response from you guys I want for someone to call me back and help me with me lease that is almost over! An apology here to seem responsive is useless at this point. Please just answer the phone or check my multiple messages and call me back.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1619473350327, 'text': 'We regret to hear that your experience has been frustrating.

<Rate>1</Rate><text>My brother has been living in these apartments for two years now and recently we have been disgusted by the service and the increasing number of thefts. This past weekend our car got broken into, while it was parked in our assigned parking spot in the garage. They stole everything, A-Z. even the light fixtures above the sun visors in both the drivers seat as well as the passenger seats. Later that evening, I noticed another car 100 yards from our car was also broken into. Cleaned from A-Z. The leasing office didn't show much emotion when we first advised them of the situation. One of the ladies said and I quote "Well it doesn't look like a forced entry." We've filed police reports and have requested to see the video footage, but according to one of their staff, they are unable to provide that footage and the footage they were able to recover didn't show anything. There is literally a camera above the second car that got broken into.

Also, the gate at this apartment always breaks. Literally broke as I was writing this post. I went down to take pictures.

If you value your family, if you value your things - Do not live here.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I am not a current resident however, looking to downsize from a single family home to apartment living, I stumbled upon this community. I am very impressed with the resort style living, demographic diversity was great, very nice upgraded units, 2 patios in each, large fitness center, walking trail, coffee bistro and bar on site which is fantastic for singles like myself! Dana was extremely helpful, very communicative throughout the process and keeping me updated on unit availability and was exceptionally diligent and provided a high level of customer service. I opted not to choose this property for space reasons only and ended up going with another one of their local properties. Irvine is phenomenal! Very impressed!< /review>< Pics>

I just wanted to rent a 2 bedroom home there and I left $350 deposit but the sales lady, Dana McCandless, one of the worst in sales I've ever seen, she convinced me not to go there, she's really bad, not available otherwise in the time of payment and the management as well as customer service is awful,  no response, no reply to any request or phone call. They are awful.</text>

I’ve been a resident here for 2 and 1/2 years this trash has been in the trash room for over 6 months I sent a email on Saturday to get the fixed along with a call to the front office, they continue to push this issue down to the maintenance team. I along with every other resident pay for trash services. This is unacceptable from a luxury apartment complex. I wish I could post the pictures and the emails but I can’t on this review</review>

<Text>Overall, I have been very disappointed with my experience at the village. First, I want to point out that rent here is higher than average for the area considering bed/bath ratio. However, with the included amenities it does seem to be worthwhile initially. Unfortunately, the Irvine company has used the excuse of the pandemic to somehow claim that hours for most amenities must be cut back. This doesn’t make sense as sanitation protocols could still be applied during off hours, considering they have 24/7 staff, and that shortening hours only crowds amenities while they are open. There is a scheduling system, but from what I’ve seen many people simply have a single resident register, then come in with everyone in their unit.

Before I continue, I want to talk about our move in. The day we moved in, our elevator was broken (of which we were not informed) & we had to carry everything up the stairs manually. I spoke with some of our neighbors who mentioned the elevator had been down for two weeks & that resident services was well aware of the issue. Informing new residents of a broken elevator prior to move in is necessary gand that failure caused many issues, & thats considering we only live on the third floor. Additionally, when we did move in we wanted to do a load of laundry immediately. However, there was very dirty and murky water in our washing machine. I contacted our move in specialist about it, reminding her that the move in checklist had been signed by her that morning, claiming she did an inspection and everything was in functioning order. She gave the the run around on the fact she committed fraud on the form, but did eventually sent someone to resolve the issue.

As far is resident services, it’s basically non-existent. I am generally against firing people because I understand that people rely on their jobs as their livelihood. However, this community claims to be a “luxury resort-style apartment community,” the service is anything but. I have called the resident services office for about four different issues while living here for about 2 months, & only ever gotten someone on the phone twice. That is after calling multiple times and leaving voicemails. My most recent issue was fairly serious, so I walked to the resident services office (closed due to the pandemic, but the doors are glass so I watched them ignore my calls, then stood outside until they came out) & spoke to a representative. This person rolled her eyes at me twice during the interaction (I didn’t mention it as I had bigger issues to deal with) & eventually ended up doing nothing but telling me her manager would be reaching out the following day. Two days later I got a call where their manager tried to gaslight me on their posted policies. After informing her that I was unhappy with the way the issue had been handled she responded with “cool.” I believe most people in that office have created a culture of negligence and deserve to be let go.

If you own an electric car, just know that they will do nothing to move ICE vehicles from electric vehicles spots, even though they have a contractually binding commitment to make them reasonably accessible, there is posted signage regarding ICE vehicles being subject to tow for parking there, & both lease agreements and guest passes have that information available. I also want to mention that they have the information of every vehicle owner at their disposal due to guard house regulations, but still won’t even reach out to owners in violation of the regulations. This community is in violation of their commitments to their residents as outlined in their lease agreement.

For what we pay, the experience has been incredibly disappointing especially considering that we moved in during a pandemic when lease rates seem to be lower than normal at the complex.

Also, I want to make it clear that I will not accept a “we cannot identify you message” from the team as a response to this review. I have seen it as a reply to other reviews. My name is the same on Google as it is in my lease agreement. Do better.</Text><user_id>118296276240868823888<//user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><Date>1621376966604<//Date></record>

This place uses every “excuse” in the book to keep the amenities closed and hours inconvenient for those that are unemployed.  I understand covid precautions but it is pretty clear they are using covid as an excuse to save on labor and maintenance costs.  Which I find despicable and unfortunate, considering the only redeeming quality of the village is the amenities.< /review>

I would not recommend this place to anyone. too expensive and way to many rules to follow., plus relatives can not visit you or drop by because the security gate does not allow no one to pass.  To get a free pass you have to call the security gate office.   No, I would not recommend this place.<//text>

I asked them to give me a new spot since there are plenty of empty spaces and having a wide truck you'd think they'd do SOMETHING but instead all I got was "it can't be that wide".

<text>We lived in The Village for exactly one year after moving cross country (moved out yesterday). 75% of our experience was great the other 25% was enough that we felt we needed to the the community.

The Great:
The amenities are just as nice as you see in the photos. The pools are beautiful and always sparkling clean. The gym has good equipment that is in good repair and is also very clean.

We had a maintenance issue X2 while there and they were extremely prompt and had the issue fixed same day.

It's generally a beautiful community and in the center of everything.

Our apartment was very nice, well maintained, and a very nice layout.

The not so Great:
5 months after move in our brand new bikes were stolen from their bike storage. Our cable lock was cut. There were 3 or 4 other cut locks in the room as well. I reported it to the office who told me to file a police report and claim it against my renter's insurance. I requested the bike storage be locked with fob access. They said they'd consider it. That never happened and bikes are stolen from bike storage routinely.

Our neighbors bike was stolen from his patio. Office had same response to his theft as ours.

For the last 2 months there has been a man who on the weekends begins walking around the community yelling to himself and anyone he comes in contact with about the media being bull**it, that he's the Attorney General of something, and verbally assaulting anyone wearing a mask. The police have been on scene multiple times. Unfortunately he lived just a few apartments down from us so when this would occur we were right in the middle of the event. **I understand he likely has mental health issues and I am sympathetic to that. I'm not suggesting he be evicted, arrested, etc only stating that this is an issue that we encountered**

Three weeks ago my car was broken into. It was parked in my designated spot, immediately inside the garage in full view of the entrance, and directly in front of a camera.  I went to the office right away and the leasing agent that answered my knock (doors closed due to Covid) was exceptionally rude. I finally met with someone (after admittedly being rather rude in return) who was very kind. I filed a police report and was allowed to terminate my lease 2 months early.

Theft among The Village is incredibly common. Cars and motorcycles are stolen frequently and car break ins are the norm. The entrance is gated, but unauthorized cars come in behind residents constantly. The exit gate has worked for exactly one day since I lived there so there is no catching these people or their license plate on the way out either.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1595610781239, 'text': 'We regret to hear that your experience did not live up to the standards that we pride ourselves on, Melissa.

<review>The complex is beautiful and centrally located. But there are MANY problems here. The employees here are nice just to get you to move in, then their true colors show. Even though there is security and it’s a gated community, they don’t do anything. There are thefts everyday! Customer service is terrible, they are unprofessional, when you reach out for help. Some maintenance workers are great but for the most part maintenance is terrible, they don’t show up when you have appts with them and they do terrible work. It’s expensive to live here and the problems you will encounter will NOT make it worth it. The fees to move out are astronomical according to most prior residents. Please read the reviews they are bad for a reason. I didn’t want to believe them when I moved in, but my experience has been mostly bad. This property is managed horribly and I have the evidence to prove it. There are plenty of other nice places to live in San Diego, don’t overpay and deal with these bad experiences.</review><name>Becky Karbett< /name>< userid>

<review>We moved in about a week ago, and so far we've experienced exceptional service from the staff here. Everyone has been friendly, accommodating, and personal. When we first toured, Dana answered all of our questions and provided a level of transparency and excitement that we didn't even know we were looking for, but which ultimately became the deciding factor in making our decision to live here.

In the short time we've lived here we've really felt a sense of community, which is important to us. The community is dog friendly, there has always been enough parking on the street, and the grounds are beautifully kept. The amenities are absolutely to die for and so far, everyone we've met has been so kind and nice :)

We are loving our experience here so far! I highly recommend
booking a tour and getting to know the people who live and work here.
It makes all the difference.<//review>< pictures>

<review>If you live in an older building you can feel how worn out the apartment really is. Walls are really thin you can hear your neighbors music all the time. We had several maintenance requests for just living here one year. The apartment complex as a whole is VERY loud. There are always drunk people screaming outside. The pool is the best asset this apartment complex has yet the security is so ridiculous & rude. They will check your bags and verify your ID just for you to be able to access the pool.<//review>< UserId.>

Seems the people complaining either don’t follow the rules or are naive about apartment living. I’m good with checking ID’s at gate to get in, to limit guests at main pool, to tow if not in designated spots and to pay a move out fee.  There’s a cost to living in this resort style complex with pool side service, mini market and daily resident events.  The beautiful landscaping and full gym with free classes it’s exceptional. Do you even know how much work goes in to prepping an apartment for new Residents? We pay a lot of money to live here and I I’m glad they set rules to keep us safe while maintaining an exceptional quality of living. Noisy neighbors, pet poop, speeding cars and move out cleaning fees happen regardless of what complex you live in. I had 1 issue with storage last year and the management team handled it professionally and swiftly.   Lighten up and enjoy this place. No other place like it! ( going on 4 years here now and love it!)<//Review>

<Text>I know there are many negative reviews on here but I wouldn’t let it sway you. We lived here for 14 months. We had parking outside our apartment. Our car was never broken into. There was dog poop everywhere for a time. That’s mostly due to lazy owners not cleaning up after their pets. During the last few months of living there I noticed less dog poop on the side walks. I waited to leave a review until I got my move out charges. I left my apartment in pretty great condition. Was charged $313 for cleaning, paint charges, and damages. That’s not bad if you ask me. For people complaing about being charged a crazy amount I’m left to question what state the apartment was left in. When the office workers make mistakes and you point it out they fix it. Sometimes people have an attitude but I can say there are some really great employees in the front office that you can speak to. When you put in a maintence request it’s usually fixed in a timely manner. The complex is gorgeous and clean. I felt safe walking around with my kids. There is a an amazing park across the street. Minutes away from shopping.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We have been living here for 8 months now and I really don't think they deserve the current low rating they have on Google! The gated community feels safe. The grounds are beautiful with lots of mature plants and trees. The management team is really helpful and responsive. The amenities are very clean and stylish. We used to live in one of the newly built Civita neighborhood apartments and we feel that the quality here is comparable. The apartment was immaculately prepared for us prior to move-in. Newly upgraded appliances are very nice. We have a beautiful view overlooking the hills and it is much quieter than where we used to live.
The trash dumpsters are frequently emptied so they are never overfilled or messy. There are inexpensive electric car charging stations around the complex.
I heard there are about 1500 units here. It is true that I have noticed some dog poop here and there but not picking up after dogs is not something we should blame the apartment management for. It's our joint responsibility to be considerate neighbors, similar to not being too loud at night. Nonetheless, all the residents I have met so far were friendly and polite.
Unless the rent is raised unreasonably every year, my husband and I feel we will be very happy living here for the long term!<//review>

Honestly really disappointed in this place and not surprised at all the negative reviews. Staffs rude, security is a waste of money, and they will pinch you for every penny.

Before moving out, my Fiance and i reported several issues with our apartment that maintenance said were "general wear and tear", and would e easy fixes that wouldn't cost us money. After filing several requests that were ignored, we moved out and received a pretty sizeable bill with fees. One of them included a "hole" in the carpet that was created just by walking in and out of the room. The maintenance guy literally took pictures of the hole and said it wouldn't be a big deal, but never finished our maintenance request. Of course when we called the leasing office the girl was rude, and said quote on quote, "We are not responsible for the maintenance team and we don't have records of their work/resident requests and you need to take up the issue yourself". Seemed really weird.

Also upon moveout we requested an inspection in case there was any other damage to be made aware of. The leasing office said it wasn't necessary because of COVID but they would do it regardless. They ignored our request and sent us a bill for $1200 claiming we ruined our entire carpet...... Plus they charged us an additional $150 per parking sticker that we didn't turn in even though we sent them a picture of our keys, key fobs, gate clicker, etc. and asked if that's everything we need to turn in. Of course the email response was yes, and mentioned nothing about turning in our stickers.

Don't live here unless you want to get taken advantage of. Also, the thefts are very very real.< /Text>

I think I've been one of the lucky ones, but I've had nothing but amazing experiences since living here. Disclaimer, I live in one of the back corners, so I can only describe my experiences having been living on the outside of the complex. My apartment has really nice upgraded features, full washer and dryer, and nice high vaulted ceilings. I haven't had any loud neighbors or smokers, like others have described. The rent is high, but you get what you pay for. The amenities here are top notch. The pool area is amazing, with pool side food and drink service. I love the salt water pool because it's easier on my skin. The gym is pretty nice and has a lot of good equipment, but is usually busy. My favorite is the store just across the clubhouse. They have a pizza oven, deli, a small salad bar and they make different dishes everyday you can pick from. Plus there's plenty of essentials if you need something real quick.</review>

<text>Living at the Village Mission Valley has been fantastic! The staff are great at their jobs, from the leasing team to resident services to grounds maintenance. You can really tell this property team takes care of the community to make it a wonderful place to live. The inclusive pet policy is also great... who wants to leave family behind?

Out of the many communities I have lived in, the amenities here are by far the best... from the pool/hot tub/ grill deck areas to the gym and lounge to the on site bistro/bar, they really try to make it a place where people can truly enjoy where they live.

The only reason my husband and I are leaving is due to closing on the purchase of a new home.

I see a lot of poor reviews on here for various reasons, but we have not experienced anything but positive experiences here.

With that said, we are about to move out soon so we will see how the move out process goes I cannot speak to that yet.

To any Irvine staff reading this, thank you for making our relatively short time here memorable and pleasant. Sorry for breaking the lease so early, but the purchase of a home and lease break was a decision we decided should be taken. We will be sure to refer friends and coworkers your way! Thanks again!< /text>< pics>

Update: back to their response. At no point have they spoken to me about anything and anytime I call resident services no one answers UNLESS you click the button saying you’re interested in moving there. Then someone always answers.
This place is trash. We pay so much money a month and they won’t even let you in the pool with your name on this list. The hot tubs are busted and don’t work?? You can’t even take food that you bought at the apartment market into the pool. No one knows how to clean up their dogs feces and packages have a 90% chance of being stolen off your door step. Do not move here.< /review>

I also have now called the office 5 times in reference to a mail issue and have only spoken to a real person once. Left multiple messages and have not been called back. The amenities at this community are amazing but unfortunately hidden behind poor customer service with the exception of the maintenance office. Those guys are awesome. I would never recommend living here to anyone because I was a quiet resident for 3 years no issues. So when I reach out I expect to be treated better. Especially with the amount of money you pay in rent. Hopes this helps.< /Text>< pics>

The receptionist was great, the leasing agent was courteous and the Sales/Closing agent was fantastic.  Every question and concern was answered.

Living here has been fantastic.  The premises is kept clean, the workers around are friendly.

The amenities are worth living here.  There is a walking/running track around the complex is about a mile long and is convenient.  The Store in the complex is an added bonus.  They have a team in there that makes fresh food for you from Breakfast till Dinner. Everything you need is in this store.
Every Friday they have a Food truck that comes out for the residents.  Just great.
The Pools are beautiful, and the area is large with a Lot of seating and cabanas, TV's and Grills to enjoy the time there.
The Clubhouse has a bar inside and a lounge to have friends to hangout. A pool table as well is an added plus.

The Gym has enough Cardio machines as well as TRX straps and classes to have aerobic workouts.

Glad I chose this place to reside in.</Text>< GmapID>

<Date>1570281316717<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><Review>WARNING! I have been a resident for a little over a year.  I moved in here because they had nice amenities, clean landscape, security, parking, and remodeled apartments.

My room mate and myself just resigned our lease in June and I am regretting our decision. For the past couple months, we have had at least 2 car break ins and/or cars have been stolen out of the underground parking in a given week. My car happens to be one of the break ins. Luckily, I didn’t have anything valuable in my car and nothing was stolen. My glove compartment was torn up with papers and everything in my center console was taken out. If you want to find out more info, check the police reports. We also have a Facebook group with residents that have tried getting out of the lease because their car was stolen and management isn’t accommodating or addressing the issue. This place has one of the highest crime rate in cars being stolen in San Diego.

I travel a ton for work and I have to park my car at my friends house because I know it’s safer there. For the amount of money I pay, this is an inconvenience. Not only is this an inconvenience but, I also feel unsafe. We will be moving out as soon as our lease is up.< /Review>< pictures>

Save yourself the trouble and don’t even bother moving here. This is the second time I’ve lived at the complex, the first time I loved it, hence why I came back. But this time has been nothing but a disaster. Not to mention there is MICE in the apartment.. and how do I know? Because I’ve found mice sh** and I hear them once in a while.. and what did The Village do? Had the pest guy give us damn sticky pads.. which the mice never went to.. Can not wait to move.<//Text>

The management is horrible. Take aside the fact that they increased the rent by 300$ per month and breaking lease is now 2 months rent.  For a two bedroom , second parking is additional, no storage allowed unless it’s additional. Even after all this fees the area remains non maintained. There is dog poop on all the trails. The mannerisms of the resident services is beyond belief. You would think their goal is to alleviate resident problems. Most of them have been rude during all my dealings. Leasing services on the other hand have been good. The business center is always out of paper and ink. If anyone requests for a replacement it’s delegated from one to another till the resident just lets it go. It’s a huge hassle dealing with them. Moving on to electric chargers. It’s a flat rate that is charged by the hour. So if you are a second off the hour you will be charged for the additional hour. The one star is for the location. Quite central to most things. I have lived in other Irvine communities this one falls far far far short. Nearby communities on friars are much better alternative.< /Text>

<text>Came to see one of their townhouses. Seemed so loud, busy, and congested. Told Dana I had a dog. She told me the unit was not dog friendly. I told her it was an ESA dog. She didn’t believe me and demanded to see the paperwork. I showed her and she kind of just rolled her eyes. Needless to say I won’t be signing a lease there<//text></record>
</dataset><record>
< text>
I moved into this apartment about 8 months ago and I just recently moved out due to job transfer. My wife checked out the place and she totally loved it so we decided to move. Everything went smooth the lease signing and the move in process. A few days later, my wife noticed a rain-like sound from behind the wall. At first, she thought it was raining so she went outside and check. It was not raining at all. She called the maintenance office to report what could be a major maintenance issue. They did not take her seriously because everything was checked thoroughly before we moved in. The sound did not go away as the evening went by. The following day, my wife noticed that carpet in the master bedroom was excessively wet and there water flooding in the living room. She called the maintenance department again to report it. Finally, the maintenance crew came and inspected what caused the water flooding. They found a major water leak in the kitchen and bathroom sinks. It took about a couple of weeks to replace the busted pipes and to also replace the carpet and laminate flooring in the living room. They also brought water-draining machines inside the apartment to drain all the water beforehand. I was not happy at all. So after the whole fiasco, I went to the leasing office to demand reimbursement for my electric bill and to get some credit due to half of my apartment was uninhabitable. I paid them $2500 for my rent and it is only fair to ask a little of it. They agreed to reimburse me for my electric bill and give me some credit for the bad experience. A few months after, I got the reimbursement for my electric bill. However, I did not get my other credit at all that they promised to apply to my next month's rent. How convenient.  IF IT was the other way around, they would have made me pay them a late fees and other penalties. So make sure you do not just take their word for it because they will take advantage of you. And yeah, my move-out expenses came out to more $1100 because they have to replace the entire carpet in the apartment. Going back to when my carpet was flooded, they did not replace the entire carpet. After I moved out, they decided it would be a great idea to replace the entire carpet in both rooms in my expense. If you were thinking of moving in here make sure you read all the reviews. Especially the move out expenses.  Yeah.. their assistance department will not do their job unless you forced them to. Do not hope that they will call you back like they promised.  The one star is for the few nice people who works there.< /text>

<text>The office lacks communication. Any time we had a question, we would be told one thing and later find out we should’ve done something else.

They say what you want to hear to get you in but the. They charge you for everything at the end. Be aware. Even if you’re the cleanest person, you won’t get your deposit back.

Awful service.</text>< Response>

All the negative reviews on this property are extremely accurate from the unprofessional leasing office that discriminate due to race and nationality all the way to the cleanliness of the community. I had a really unpleasant experience here unfortunately since the property itself has a potential to be competing with the rest of the properties in mission valley. The leasing office (except the managers) are very rude and unresponsive and they make you regret signing a contract with them. They don’t have the experience needed to deal with residents neither morally nor professionally dealing with problems the residents might have. I strongly believe no one should live here until some changes in the leasing team especially the resident services office have been made. There are a lot of other choices in mission valley that I strongly recommend due to months of experience with them now. At first this property might seem friendly but once you actually get to deal with them you will understand what i’m saying. In no way are all the reviews here wrong, just take that under consideration the next time you think about moving to this property. RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL resident services office unlike the rest of Irvine company properties.< /Review>

<text>3 WEEKS LATER UPDATE: The complex made sure to post on the reviews that they would "contact me shortly"...still no contact, reinforcing my point about the garbage resident services.

The Village is without a doubt one of the most beautiful locations I have ever lived in while being the most frustrating and negative experience. The tour and personnel that show you around the amenities and apartments are great and incredibly nice. I couldn't speak any better of a wonderful maintenance staff. However, resident services is absolutely horrid. They ignore any requests or are blatantly rude the few times they decide to answer the phone. They ignore legitimate concerns from residents, such as security, instead responding with "well you signed a lease that says we don't have to provide security". Lastly, I am already anticipating requiring savings for legal fees for move out after hearing from every person moving out being charged $1000+ for what amounts to renovating the apartment for the landlord (replacing all flooring, etc.). Practices like this of charging people for the "normal wear and tear" of their rental are obviously blatantly against California housing codes that are designed specifically to protect tenants against corrupt landlords such as these. Please, if you value your money, look elsewhere for housing.<//text><name>BVH 3030</name></record>

<Date>1565883515297< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Have been living here for over a year now and the reasoning for the low rating is how they have been dealing with my motorcycle parking garage situation.

Upon moving into our second unit we leased from the village, going from a one bedroom to a two, they offered us motorcycle parking for my motorcycle.

1.)Within the first month it was noticable that maintenance also used the same garage for their storage. This garage has multiple motorcycle parking spots so they were using the others not in use to house appliances.  Well they kept parking refrigerators and washing machines in front of my spot day, after day, after day. Never got better until they finally moved their storage location after a month and a half of complaining.

2.) After the maintenance incident it was followed by their security patrol team parking their extra golf carts in front of the door. Allowing me to not be able to get in or out of the garage.  When I went to talk to them about this they said sorry and didn't even entertain the idea of a refund of money and would only offer their regrets.

3. Now today I go to leave at 7am, and the garage is locked and nobody comes in from resident services till 9am so now I'm late again because of their careless handling of this parking option they offered.

I have been late countless time to class and a couple of times to work because of the way they keep handling the situation. And once alerted that I'm late because of them they take a hour or a hour and a half to move appliances or golf carts from the parking spot they issued me.

This has been going on from May 2019 through August 2019 now.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>ZERO STARS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!

We pay so dang much to live here and when you need them, they never answer the dang phone, are always short staffed, they are rude, and the fobs are always being deactivated due to their darn system or whatever excuse they use. Resident services sucks and on top of that, I now have to save money for an attorney for when we do move out because I am super clean and if they think we're going to let them take advantage of us regarding the carpet or walls, they have another thing coming. It's beautiful but don't move here. The service sucks in every way possible.

Update 12/3/18 - April, the receptionist, decides to lecture me on trying to get my kid to step out of adult conversations. She attacked me verbally and refused to talk and made me wait until lunch was over to check out which wasn't a big deal. Stay in your place receptionist, leave the check out process to the professionals. You lack customer service skills and I work in HR and guarantee, you'd be gone with the way you treated a client. I just want out of this horrible place. An attorney I will be contacted if they try to overcharge me.< /review>< Pictures>

The Pros: The main pool, gym, and most of their facilities are awesome. People in the renting office are super nice and it's comforting knowing the guard shack is manned 24/7 and screen all non-residents. They have food trucks parked in front of the leasing office most weekends. Market is on sight with a surprising array of items. Apartments are cute as well. We have laminate "wood" floors and a fireplace in ours. Somewhat small for a 1 bedroom, but we were prepared for that being so close to the city. Conveniently located and a short drive or Uber ride to wherever you want to go in downtown.

The Cons: All that being said, maintenance is a nightmare. We've lived here 3 short months and have had issues since we moved in. It started with the ice maker, which took 3 guys and 3 days to finally sort out. Our neighbor's apartment flooded, which resulted in about 3 weeks of loud construction on the other side of our paper-thin wall. A couple weeks later the same neighbor's sink backed up, causing a backup in our sink as well. I had maintenance guys pounding on my door at 10:30pm to snake the drain before it overflowed. Another time, my carbon monoxide detector was going off, and after no response from the maintenance team I decided to call the fire department. Aside from maintenance related issues, dog owners let their dogs pee on the concrete in the somewhat enclosed courtyard areas within the buildings, so every time I walk out my door it reeks of urine. The pool access gate closest to my apartment has been permanently broken (or deactivated) since we got here, so we have to walk all the way around when we should be able to pop right in the back gate. If you have more than 1 car and don't pay for an additional parking permit, parking can suck. I've also been woken up by drunk neighbors screaming and slamming doors. Not fun when you have to be at work at 4am.

All in all, it's a nice place but much too pricey for the issues that come with it, in my opinion.<//Review>< Pictures>

We haven’t even moved in yet and have had more than our fair share of issues. The app and what the leasing office sees are two very different numbers for rent being due, which they weren’t understanding.  In addition, we’re moving from Chicago and called weeks ago to have our large items moved in to the apartment today (we will be moving in tomorrow). They wouldn’t let the movers into the complex, and now we’re having to pay to extra shipping and a new delivery date (the soonest being Saturday) all because the office staff couldn’t get it together. They were less than helpful, full of attitude and overall showed very poor customer service. If the amenities weren’t so good we would not be staying here.< /text>

My husband and I have lived here for 18 months now. We extended after our first year and moved to a different unit. And all our headaches started right there. They tried to charge us for over a 1k for cleaning the previous apartment. (sorry that we hang up some pictures and walked on the carpet).  They tow cars here on daily basis and they don't care about anyone and anything. We had our very visible fob in the car when we parked in the outside parking lot for 30 minutes and got towed after 10minutes. Our AC has been acting funny and is set up weird way and keeps being on strange modes like " override". I called the service center and left a voicemail and of course no one bothers to respond. Our electricity bill just came and  was $270. They just can't care less about their customers. Please don't move in here, they have pools and gyms everywhere else.< /text>

<Text>I've moved 10x in 10 years living in San Diego.  That is one of the main reasons why I rent because I want to experience all the different areas.  So as it was time to start searching I Popped in to visit this property a few months ago and Tabitha showed us a bunch of options but wasn't pushy just let the property speak for itself.   We went home and signed up online and then Ross handled it from there.  He was very prompt and helpful with the pre-move in details and made the transition to moving easy.  On our move in date Amanda made our move simple and fast.  Anything I've needed since then Amanda has been on top of to make it happen.   We have a one bedroom with two spots (paid for the second one) and our friends come up and visit with no issues finding parking.    I'm excited to see the new bistro open and the guard gate to be fully functional in the next few weeks!  Construction is on going but they keep you informed and I actually haven't heard it at all and I work from home.  So all in all its a great time to move if you want amazing incentives.<//Text><rating>5< /rating>< response>

This place is awesome if you’re into partying like it’s spring break. Tons of loud drunk people outside the clubhouse singing and talking loud each night from 11pm till 2am. It’s great cause all you have to do is turn on a fan fan, shut your window, and pop in some ear plugs. Security is great. They don’t do anything when called so party like it’s spring break. No worries here. This place is perfect if you’re into the college scene.<//review>

I don't understand the negative reviews.  This place is amazing.  Mikey in the leasing office bends over backwards to solve issues. McKenzie is great. Every one else in the office is nice that I have met

The service guys go above and beyond,  even replacing my light bulbs and repairing things they dont have to.

Maybe is just my experience?

The bar crew is super friendly,  the pools areas are like a resort and I never feel over crowded. I have no neighbor noise. I got a great parking spot.

All this for what I think is a great price. People are amazed when I yell them my rent after seeing the place. Got a great deal when I signed up too.

DON'T MOVE TO THE VILLAGE MISSION VALLEY. My husband and I moved there a year ago and we decided to move out because of the price and they just took all of our deposit saying that they needed to paint the apartment and change the carpet, WHAT? we hang a few pictures and we stepped on the carpet, I am sorry we lived there??? What the heck??? Never in my live somebody took any of my deposit when I moved out and trust me, I had the same pictures before. If you actually are going to be in your apartment at least to sleep, like us, DON'T MOVE TO THIS PLACE. What a way to make you pay for what THEY HAVE TO DO ANYWAY BY LAW. Not only they are taking our deposit but also asking for a bunch of more money!!! Pathetic!!! Please, everybody that have had the same experience like us, contact me. Let's cut this here so this doesn't happen to anybody else.<//Review>

<Review>I just moved in a couple weeks ago and although there were a couple hick-ups moving in, the management team was responsive and got things resolved in a timely manner. I will update my comment in a couple months, for now very nice property great amenities and nice professional staff!

The property is very well maintained and has very nice amenities, like onsite Business Center, grocery store, restaurant & bar, 24 Hour Fitness Center, and multiple massive pools.< /Review><userid>109632326810625789728</userid><resp>{'time': 1486169109740, 'text': 'Hi David!\n\nThank you for choosing to make Village Mission Valley your new home!

< review>
Stopped by for the first time to visit a family member who recently moved to this community and also stop by at the leasing office to get some information with the possibility of moving there.
I was in the line for 20 minutes just to get to the front gate so the security guy, gatekeeper or whatever you wanna call him welcome me with the worst possible attitude. I mean , dude! , you only have one job and thats to let the people in and out and show some customer sevice in case they ask you question or something. I dont know how you got this job but you cant even do the most basic task in the world.
After the horrible experience dealing with the gate guys attitude and him not helping me with giving directions. I spent another 40 minutes driving around the community hoping to find a place to part and no luck. Visitors can only park off the 2 main street and good luck finding an empty spot.
I ended up leaving after wasting 1 hr and 10 minutes of my time. I would never step in this community ever again.<//review>

The clubhouse is amazing and the gym too.!The pool area is beautiful like a 5 star resort!
I am sorry that I smell smoke a lot in my unit but even the smoke free areas have renters that can smoke until their lease expires. No apartment or condo complex is perfect, but this is close!!<//Text>< Pictures>

This place is heaven! It's too bad they still have a low rating because of the legacy left over from the old owners, but these guys deserve 5 stars without a doubt. Great, friendly staff. Clean and upkept property. Highly, highly recommended!</Text>

This place is amazing! Lived here for a year, I must warn you that if you work up north, it is a pretty long commute, but that was no fault of the management. The place is amazing, it's on top of a hill with a spectacular view as you're driving up. The clubhouse and pool feel so high quality, constantly cleaned and bartenders are chill, and the events they throw are so nice to even simply hang around and watch.

It really does feel like resort living here, there were absolutely no pest problems that I had (compared to UTC areas where ants are everywhere). The management handled most of my concerns quickly and with professionalism. Guest parking is not too bad, it's definitely the best type of guest apartment parking you're gonna get around here but still gets crowded, and resident parking is competitive but worse case scenario is you park outside your garage or walk a block further than you normally would. Kevin is a great salesman and helped guide us through everything, and Amy from the front desk is super friendly and nice as well! Im sad to go but a long commute will mentally drain you, so always be sure you can handle the commute!<//Review>

<text>Fairly quiet neighborhood and all my neighbors were nice.  I lived there during the renovations, and working from home, this posed quite a few issues with noise.  They also felt necessary to do minor renovations in my apartment while I was living there, causing further headaches.  Upon signing my lease they failed to mention they would be closing 2 of the pools, all tennis courts, basketball, volleyball, and the gym...basically leaving no onsite amenities except the main pool.  The administrators are nice, but certainly focus on gaining new business rather than maintaining current clientele.

For the price, you are better off living in a smaller community in Mission Valley.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

0 STARS!

Where do I begin...

Honestly, the first place to begin is reading the previous reviews, I read them last March when I was doing research on where to move, and I disregarded them thinking that maybe the issues were a one time thing. Now reading all other reviews I realize I am not alone and that there are large issues within the complex.

First and foremost, bugs, there is a serious issue with not only cockroaches at The Village, but there are silverfish as well. We were treated twice, please note you will have to leave, and the exterminators don't even know what they are treating the apartment for, it's extremely unorganized, if we weren't there they would've sprayed for ants. Outside at night you will find large cockroaches which are larger than mice, and sometimes you will find them squashed on the sidewalk.

If you have more than one car, be prepared for absolutely no parking, everytime you come home the majority of the time there is a tow truck that comes around. This didn't affect me, but the reviews are true, you will most likely get fined or towed.

Neighbors...be prepared to almost get run over as nobody follows the rules of the road, and I have witnessed others who are walking their dogs who almost get hit, I had this happen to myself on numerous occasions. Not only do people speed through the streets, but from my experience the neighbors below would refuse to take their garbage to the common trash area. They would throw their garbage into the trash bins next to the mailboxes. This was an ongoing issue, which after going to resident services and reporting it over 2 months, I stopped going, as the neighbors were only given warnings.
*If you have a dog, I would strongly advise not moving here for the safety of your animal when you are out taking them on a walk on the sidewalk area.

The best part...moving out:
We did a pre-move out inspection before we moved out. We were told that the carpets were installed in 2014, and that they were going to replace the carpets after we moved out regardless and we would not be charged. We had a form completed as well, which was for this purpose, which specified the areas that we would get charged, this line item was shown as N/A as these were going to be replaced. Fast forward, to now we were told that it was an estimate and we were charged for one year prorated which comes to $361 to replace the carpet. I spoke with the customer service center and was told there was nothing that could be done, and sorry for the miscommunication. I truly feel this is unacceptable, I want to share my experience as this clearly happens to countless others.

In conclusion, I wouldn't give them any stars as nothing can be resolved by their customer service. You will be advised to call their office number, which again it's a friendly well sorry for the miscommunication better luck next time.

Cheers, to not living in an overpriced, bug infested complex any longer.

I wish you all the best in your search!</text>

The ONLY reason why I'm not giving one star is because while your STAY at the apartment is amazing and the apartment complex itself is beautiful. The MOVE OUT is a NIGHTMARE!!!! The Village Mission Valley didnt show up at the pre inspection that was scheduled, instead they came without giving me as notice. As of now the pre inspection guy say the estimated is OVER $2000!!!! $1400 OF IT IS JUST THE CARPET ONLY. I admit some of the charges I understand like damage and cleaning. But $1400 for cheap a** carpet that THEY DAMAGE  AND DIDN'T REPLACE WHEN MY APT FLOODED!!! ALSO 250 TO REPAINT THE WALL!</Text>

<review>We are a military family who chose to call this apartment complex home while we got familiar with the area.  I would not recommend this complex to military families.  If you are single, a college student, or just like to party, this place is for you (providing you do not care about your safety or insect infestations). This complex is massive, has lots of people moving in and out at any time, not family friendly, and not at all concerned with customer service/loyalty.  If you have issues you have to take it up with corporate in writing which will take 90 days. While here there was a woman raped in her apartment while her child was with her. The complex sent out a notice with a picture saying there was an incident long after it had occurred. The notice didn’t even warn tenants that she was raped. If they show you a unit the looks nice, beware as they will probably put you in one that is the exact same floor plan but 20 years older. The walls are paper thin, and you can hear people walking by crystal clear, they in turn can hear you whether you are in your bathroom or bedroom.  You can hear every word and every step from the tenants above you, and hear them at night. The unit we were in had blinds that had huge gaps in it, a flaw in their installation, so when people walked by they could see what you were doing, bedrooms and all.  Maintenance was good but only showed up if the problem was something that would cause permanent damage to the unit. There was also a very bad silver fish problem in our unit that was never addressed and thankfully when we moved they did not come with us.  The pools and grounds are beautiful but on the weekends become a big drunk party/pick up scene. The parking is terrible and if you are lucky enough to get an assigned parking spot someone will try to park in it when you are not around. If you have two vehicles, you will need to battle the leasing office to get a second spot, or you will find yourself parking on a large hill with everyone else far away from your apartment. Watch your children, cars speed up and down the car port area and around corners. You could see cars that were damaged by other drivers parked on the hill and street.  Also the car ports are small so if you have a large vehicle you will probably take out your mirror every now and then.  The complex is located near a really good school. If I didn’t hate it so much we would have stayed for that reason alone. Good luck, I was relieved to finally move and be rid of them.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I have currently lived here for 8 months. my patience has run out. This place is a joke. Everything previously mentioned is still true to date. They hype this place up to be so great and they really sell you on how awesome its going to be yet everything has taken much longer than planned. From constant maintenance, to dog poop, broken hot tubs, pool out of service and the worst is parking. I live in a 2 person apt and they only gave us 1 parking spot that cant fit a go kart. The street out front just lost about 30 spots because they painted it all red. The cost to live here is was over priced. They are cheap, the fixtures and appliances are terrible. The washer and dryers make so much noise you feel you need to wear ear plugs. It really annoys me they blow so much money on the landscaping and paying for a bunch of illegals to work here and security that doesn't do there job besides kick ppl out of the pool area at 10pm its reflected on the cost of living here. I can't wait for my lease to be up and move out of this circus. I'm military and have already told numerous friends to stay away and I would avoid this place like Ebola.</Review>< Pics>

We moved here in mid January. First when I look ed to reviews, I was scared to move here, since people were complaining about smoking neighbors and crazy driving kids. Anyway we moved and we got nice apartment with 2 free months. I think it depends which building you live in. The neighbors in our building are mostly families, so no crazy smokers. Also one more thing, it is true that most people who like the village does not put reviews but whoever does not like it puts bad reviews right away.< /text>

<review>Giving one star review is extremely hard for me as a business owner that knows this affects a business right at its core.
If you are a pet owner this place is not for you.

I was walking by the trail yesterday with my dog and in a moment of distraction my dog got in a fight with another dog and while me and the other dog owner tried to separate them the other dog owner got hurt a little bit on his left wrist.

I agree I should’ve taken more control on my dog when it faces another dog that is declared as an aggressive breed however I did my best by pulling them apart and there was nothing more I could do to avoid this situation.

Beyond the fact the other dog owner didn’t make a big deal out of it especially as the damage didn’t break through his skin, this apartment complex wants to take from me the most precious thing I have in my life, my emotional support dog,
The one that helps me with my medical situation.

This apartment community you don’t have a second chance they just want you to get rid of your pet like if it was trash.
They gave me 72 hours to get rid of my dog with no chances to explain and even though me and the other dog owner went together to explain how the situation happened, since you are talking to a big corporation they don’t care and they will just throw you off.

Of course I would never recommend any of my friends to live in an apartment Community such as the Village Mission Valley for case like mine and others.

Do yourself a favor and go live in Portofino or the verge apartment communities those are much more caring for their residents.<//review>< gmapID>

When I first moved here I thought everything was great and that management was going to be fine. I should have listened to the reviews people left about how horrible management is when problems occur.

We have had MANY issues that management seems to not care about nor our well being at all.

In the past few months we have had many issues with our upstairs neighbors throwing and damaging our personal property on our open patio. I reached out to management to seek help in resolving the issue and was told it was being resolved and then it happened AGAIN this time hitting cars. I reached out again and told them I felt uncomfortable they said for me to wait 1-2 weeks to talk with the neighbors. I had no follow up during this time unless I reached out to them. At the end of the 2 weeks I told them I hadnt received an update on anything I still felt uncomfortable that something else was going to happen and told them I wanted to be relocated. They told me that I would have to pay a fee because I waited too long.. AKA the 2 weeks I waited for them to "talk to these neighbors".

I still have not had any resolution from management. They continuously just tell me I will have a fee for anything to move within the complex or to end my lease. They have done nothing to help assist us or make us feel more comfortable. We pay way too much to deal with people spitting, pouring, throwing items onto our belongings and vehicles. AND I was told they would assist us in cleaning up our patio and they never arrived.

I take back everything I said about this place. Management is horrible and they dont care about you, your belongings or your well being.
SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.< /text>

<review>I don't want to jinx things by writing a positive review, but I've had almost nothing but good things to say about this place. Yes, there is a bit of construction noise, but the six weeks free makes me feel like it's something I can look past. The gym is awesome, has very flexible hours, and the pools are nice. Some people have written crummy reviews because something is broken, or landscaping is ongoing, but stuff breaks--it happens! Admittedly, our apartment has one of the nicest and quietest views in the complex, so I may be biased, but I love it. Renovated everything, friendly staff, and cool events like food trucks pretty frequently. I will say this is the most expensive place I've ever lived, and for that reason I only give it 4 stars, but otherwise very few complaints.< /review>< UserId.>

Every guest must show an ID to enter, unless they flirt with the ugly security girl, then they don't have to show ID.  Security is always on a power trip,  but can you blame them?  What a boring awful job. I guess I would chat with every car that I wanted to as well if I were paid a low hourly wage and have no regard for the time of others.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I am basically giving a 5 star review due to the amazing Amanda Shipley.  Not once during our tour of the grounds did she sugar coat anything.  She was very tentative to our concerns and request during the view of the apartments. The Village looked simply amazing and the grounds were emacculant.  My fiancee and I originally looked a townhome but by the time we were ready to hold it the both of them were gone. So we got a different apartment and signed the lease.  Just this morning I get an amazing phone call from Amanda saying that another townhome has come available and that if we would like that one we can go ahead and do that and of course we took that one and the fact that she still got us what we wanted and that we were her top priority says alot about the staff.  We have yet to move in and every single cost and every single thing we talked about was laid out for us and so easy.  Thank you Amanda for your great customer service and thank you for being the first apartment complex that we went to that didnt try and lie to us. We cannot wait to move in.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1557856579896, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your home-finding experience, Anthony!

<review>DON'T RENT FROM HERE

I was charged for carpet replacement after moving out even though we were told by the pre-move out inspector that they planned to replace the carpet and would not charge us. (They said the carpet was at the end of life.) The Village refused to offer the deposit amount back. A pre-move out inspection is supposed to identify issues that need to be resolved, before move out and replacing the carpet was marked N/A, however, they try to be slick and say N/A is an "estimate". What?!?!?

The Village is also infested with cockroaches. You find large cockroaches crawling outside in the parking lot and they also enter your home when summer begins. Get use to stepping on cockroaches that are so big they will make a popping noise under your shoe. Also get ready to wash cockroach guts off your shoe. The Village is also infested with silverfish. We had their exterminator spray twice and the insects were still around. Also don't trust leaving anything valuable in your house when they come by since they have full access with no one home.

Enjoy the lovely photos of these bugs I took in my apartment there.<//review></record></dataset><record>

There staff is snobby and think they are better than you. Customer is never right. I am in the military and I will let all military personnel know not to live here. Its a waste of money. Only 1 parking space. NO storage space at all. Overpriced just because the pools look nice. Our move out cost is over $800.00. I wanted to move out after week one. The paint looks nice but behind it is an old apartment that has not been updated. Chords fall right out of the plugs. No lights. No fans. You have to buy your own except for bathroom and kitchen.<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
Former tenant of Village Mission Valley - DO NOT EVER MOVE HERE.  WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD LIVING IN A COMPLEX.  BEWARE THEY ARE ALL ABOUT MONEY, NO CONCERNS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.  HORRIBLE SERVICE, NOISEY, THEFT, RIP YOU OFF IN MOVE OUT EXPENSES.

THEY COST ME AROUND $7,500 IN MOVE OUT EXPENSES FOR BREAKING A LEASE LESS THAN 30 DAY NOTICE.  YES THAT IS TRUE...$7,500!!!!  RELOCATED FOR MY JOB AND THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. I GAVE THEM 3 WEEKS NOTICE BUT THAT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  I WAS THERE 5 MONTHS AND THEY CHARGED ME FOR NEW CARPET AND FLOORING AND CLEANING (but that was ok for cleaning).  PLUS THEY KEPT ALL SECURITY DEPOSIT AND STILL SOUGHT OUT ADDITIONAL MONEY ON TOP OF THAT. IN THE END, IT WILL BE ABOUT $7,500 FOR MOVING OUT OF THERE.

PLEASE READ ALL REVIEWS PRIOR TO MAKING YOUR DECISION.  WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINTS.....THERE IS SOMETHING THERE. I EVEN WENT TO CORPORATE AND THEY WERE NO USE EITHER. ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.  NOT TENANTS NOR REPUTATION.

PLENTY OF COMPLEXES TO CHOOSE FROM.  KEEP LOOKING. IT ALL LOOKS GOOD WITH THE POOL AND ALL, BUT IT IS NOT WORTH IT.  THE Y DOWN FRIARS, WILL BE CHEAPER TO SIGN UP THERE THAN TO PAY THE ADDITIONAL RENT JUST FOR A POOL.  PLUS IT IS A BEACH CITY.  PLEASE NEED WATER, HEAD TO THE BEACH...ITS FREE!!

MY RATING IS ACTUALLY A NEGATIVE NUMBER, BUT POSTING WON"T LET YOU DO THAT.</review>

<Text>we have been here for 6 months now and it's been a constant nightmare. the harassment, stealing and drug use is out of control. if security gets high I'm not surprised they allow it here. I've had people yell at my children, the people upstairs burned my kids toys with their cigarettes and they poisoned our service dog and I showed them proof and nothing was done. my husband motorcycle was stolen and cars got broken into. packages get stolen from your front door. I gave them paperwork from my Dr saying he recommended me to move out and still no solution was offered. the constant smell of Marijuana and smoke is an issue 24/7 inside my apt finally made me give up on this place was having cops show up at midnight because the upstairs neighbors called accusing a man of threatening to shot us. the only male voice they could have heard was my 2 year old who was asleep since 9pm and again nothing was done. I finally decided to leave and of course I'm taking them to court.< /Text>< userid>

The longer I lived here the more I have grown to dislike this apartment complex.

We used to just pay a VERY EXPENSIVE lease to have certain amenities, and now we have to continue to pay our expensive lease and have to pay an extra fee to use said amenities.

La Mirage is a nickel and dime operation-plain and simple

We lived at La Mirage for just over a year.  We didn’t have a lot of maintenance requests, we never called in noise complaints despite the entire complex being a 24 hour nightclub, we ALWAYS paid our rent on time, and here’s how La Mirage showed their appreciation:

1.	We were one of the few residents at La Mirage who were honest about having a dog.  That cost us an additional $400 security deposit and and additional $45/month in “pet rent”.  We found out later that most dog owners don’t register their pets with La Mirage to avoid these fees.  Again, to show their appreciation, they tried to raise not only OUR rent after our first year, but our PET RENT as well!!!

2.	The amenities are great, as long as you don’t mind sharing them with half of San Diego/non-residents.  We once went to the pool only to find the locked door propped open by a chair, because someone decided to have a pool party for non-residents.

3.	What are the chances that when 2 people sign a lease, only 1 of them is going to have a car? Our apartment came with 1 parking spot, leaving one of us to fend for ourselves on the blind curves of Reflection Drive. La Mirage was so sympathetic to our dilemma that they offered to RENT us an extra parking spot for $50 a month.  Are they kidding? Best of luck finding parking on the weekends when everybody and their brother is there using the pool/gym/volleyball courts etc.

4.	We lived a very mild year in our apartment, no parties, hardly any visitors, and unlike most of our neighbors, we are adults.  Upon moving out, we discovered that not only had they found a way to use up all $800 of our security desposit, they have manufactured almost $400 in additional charges!  Upon review, it turns out that some of the charges are actually MATHEMATICAL ERRORS on their part, but don’t bother trying to contact anyone at the business office to discuss, James is out sick for the day.  That’s right, they have ONE person in their business office for their thousands of residents. One would think that instead of hiring the person who plans “Movie Night”, they would actually have at least one other person with whom you can discuss your account.

Renter Beware.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>DO NOT MOVE HERE. There are plenty of places in San Diego that are much more affordable. On the 29th of October I had an incident in my apartment where I was physically attacked and almost murdered and my apartment vandalized and my belongings robbed from me and I could not call 911 during the entire incident BECAUSE THERE IS NO CELL SERVICE in ANY of the apartment homes here. Absolutely not safe. Not to mention the security staff has lack of professionalism and LET the attacker back on to the campus after the incident. I have proof of all of this. Also, the cameras do not work which gives them the upper hand to avoid liability. I moved out after the incident THANK GOD. This complex will be receiving 0 dollars from me. Also don't move by the pool because you will be blasted with loud music and screaming children. There is tons of vandalism and break ins for vehicles and homes and a lot of prostitutes pimps and drug dealers working out of their homes here. Again I advise anyone to not move here. Extremely overpriced for what you get. I guarantee you will be miserable. Write me personally to ask I have no problem telling.<//Review><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

As a resident for 8+ years I am sad to say things have gone downhill. The amount of dog urine and feces on the stairs  (and I work with animals for a living) is repulsive. Not to mention in the parking garages. Concerns being addressed are not taken seriously. I’ve found articles of clothing on the ledge of my patio which do not belong to me-which is a little unnerving. I’ve had the overhead bulbs changed in my apartment and they keep blowing out as soon as they’re replaced. Toys being thrown over blaconys randomly, winding up on my patio and making a mess of our walkway. Cleaning sweeps but not to our walkway. We can’t have any sort of privacy shade and we are in the unit directly above the building # over the garage so people look into our place constantly. We put up a nice one and were notified that we would be fined if not removed. And the howling dog next door has continued for 6 months. He’s cute, but it’s not early am and late eve. Sad to leave this place when my lease is up. I used to love living here. Bummer!</text>

My husband and I lived here for 10 months and then moved. In those 10 months of being overcharged for rent, they asked us to stay and pay even more for rent! The fire pits at the pool never worked, getting a community grill to light and stay on was a challenge and it seems that they only care about attracting more tenants then keeping those they have. I can’t twll you how many times the front gate was broken, sprinkler heads flooded the parking lots and pit bulls moved in. Dog poop everywhere, pet waste bags never stocked back up in time, and ungodly move out charges compared to the quote they leave you during your pre move out inspection. The maintenance guys are nice, but never show up during the 4-hr window they are given, wasting your entire day and don’t bother leaving a voicemail at the office they never answer their phone or return your call. If you want to get ahold of someone you have to call corporate.</review>

DO NOT MOVE HERE. I am 2 months into my lease from hell and it has been NOTHING like we were told. We are a military family that moved from VA. I am writing this as I'm on hold with someone in the office denating a "pay or get evicted" notice we found in our door. Apparently we owe more money from Oct that is not stated in the agreement and their way of telling us is a letter giving us 3 days to pay or else. They have no integrity whatsoever. Even though I have a notice from Kevin Kroll who helped is in the apartment search, I am still wrong about payment. I had to almost scream at the lady on the phone for a supervisor because she didnt see why I didnt just "listen" to her. It not that I am not listening, it's that I disagree based off Kevin and their online portal of payment due. She laughed at me until I yelled for a supervisor. I am 20 minutes in to holding for someone who I hope can help, but I don't it.  Moving here was the worst mistake we ever made and I cant wait till we leave here. They have zero respect and LIE about military discounts.<//review>

< review>
I don't understand all the negativity. I moved in the first of August and can't be happier. The place is huge, I think they said over 1,500 residents, so if you don't like to be around other people, this place is not for you. I use many of the amenities, bar, cafe, gym, fitness classes, pool, hot tub, regular Friday night movies and other events. Random mornings you will find the staff at the gate handing out coffee and breakfast bagels to go. The apartments are really nice and the few maintenance and other issues I've had, have been handled quickly and professionally. Follow the rules which all seem to be common sense, don't take yourself too seriously (there's quite a few successful or wannabe successful people in this complex, I think some of these negative reviews are from those Primadona types) and you'll have a great experience.</review>

<time>1372309538919<//time><Rate>2</Rate><review>WORST apartment complex I have ever lived in. They will raise your rent by 200 dollars for random fees that didn't apply when you first moved in and they make up rules for the complex. They have a major ANT problem. The past couple of days the pipes have been clogging up and our sinks have been overflowing with black water. The cleaning guys will push all the dirt into your patio by the front door and people up above (if on first floor) will drop all of their cigarette butts and garbage on your patio. I have complained about it before and they won't even do anything to fix it. It is one thing right after another with this place. The residents don't clean up their dogs poop and just leaves it for others to clean up. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything and everyone. No one has respect here and I do not recommend you live here. If so, good luck. Another resident even told me it is not the place to have kids because there are so many parties and disrespectful people. This is by far the worst place I have ever lived. The prices are too high for what they don't give.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

As my lease comes to an end, I say that I am gladly NOT renewing due to the horrible experience I have had here. Between the lack of support coming from Resident Services and the type of people they allow to live here, this is not a place called home. All Irvine Company seems to care about is getting money from whomever and however.

I have an emotional companion dog who is verified by the complex to live here. Yet for the second time, I had a resident approach me yelling at me and cussing at me about my dog. This is not an appropriate situation as I have an emotional therapy dog for a reason. I felt harrassed, threatened, and extremely unsafe as he came up to my face. My dog was in an area where he was allowed and yet, this man felt it was necessary to continue yelling at me and call me a lier.

Resident services will not take care of you. Before this situation, I had a hole in my ceiling for 3 months due to faulty A/C and now they are saying they need to open my wall because of a possible refrigerant leak.

I also can say that, despite this review, they STILL most likely won't respond to my email or voicemail.< /text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>I lived here for 6 months and I decided to end my lease early.

Pros
*Mackenzie in the RSO is amazing
*nice amenities
*nice neighbors (the majority)
*option to go rent responsible if you want to break your lease

Cons
*Overpriced
*Management
-inconsistent management practices
-left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing office atmosphere
-lacks communication
-clueless on policies and procedure
-inexperienced supervisors
*Front gate is frequently out of service
*Loud neighbors
*Visitor parking severely limited
*90 additional apartments being added is going to seriously overcrowd this place more than it already is.

My stay was not completely awful, but any time I had to talk to anyone in the Resident Services Office, it often was a puzzling experience. Maybe when they switch into their new building they will be to provide a better experience for the next potential resident.

I suggest checking out the smaller properties in the area before making a decision, they seem to be a bit less expensive and offer the same amenities and perhaps a better customer experience.<//text><name>Shane McCauley<//name><gmap_id>0x80d95596aa481a7f:0x319290bbe3eba18b<//gmap_id>< Resp>

Nice place to live but only one complaint. You guys charge $1800 for a one-bedroom; cool I get it don't blame you...but you only allow up to two guests to the pool area, can't bring your own drinks because you have a stupid liquor license as well. Why have you guys not implemented a system that you can go into the leasing office and let them know you are having a big party coming in. I don't have children, but I remember one case specifically where you wouldn't allow there family members to come in because of this dumb policy.

I work in marketing and to be honest the fact that you only allow 2 guests per household really limits your potential sales from the Viviant. I come from the facility in Irvine and I have to say I am disappointed with management of The Village. You guys aren't very concerned about working with your community to build solutions to simple issues. Please don't bother replying with a "We're sorry about your experience" just figure out a solution to this issue...I guarantee I am not the only one who is annoyed by this.<//Text>

Everything NEEDS to be IMPROVED. Customer service is horrible. Maintenance is horrible, everything is broken. This property likes to put tape over things that are broken. For instance, they can just buy a new gate because it breaks every other day with either the sensors or it gets stuck. They keep trying to maintain it and fix it when they can simply buy a new one. They are too cheap and too prideful to do so. Then you have maintenance workers who come to the apartment and don't speak English; so while they are speaking in Spanish we have no communication what so ever. I am all for equality but atleast have a bilingual if majority of the property speaks just English. I won't forget on move in day when the guy says, "Don't matter if you mess up the carpet or damage anything you won't get your deposit back anyway. Irvine says its a deposit but really they don't return it." Great first impression. So every 3 to 4 days the gate remains broken. This goes for everything in the apartments as well. The rent is overpriced. There is always issues at residential service because no one answers there phones and once you walk into the office they are just eating candy and running their mouths. People are speeding and not using stop signs when it clearly states 10 mph. Everything on the property is overpriced. They say, "Love the place you live" but they could care less as long as they get their money you are just another number. They treat residents like chopped liver. Once my lease is up I will move and never live in any Irvine Company. I should have listened to the bad reviews and their hate Facebook page when they discussed so many complaints. Learned my lesson the hard way. They deserve zero stars.

I don't want to hear no "sorry for your convenience, or call the residential service office, in the leasing it states... NO" how about you guys stop taking people's money and do right by the complex. Sick and tired of corporations like these taking advantage of people. Will for sure be discussing this with my lawyers. You guys are a piece of work. MY daughter is suffering here and all corporate states is.. we waived a $200 fee. Their would be no fee if you guys did your damn jobs. Jessica, Cami, Ariana, and the guy that works their need to all be fired.

Side note, you guys fire and re-hire and the place is still a mess. Get it together. DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!! The pictures online won't be the apartments you actually move in. The ones you move in will be old from 1990's with no back splash, old white washers/dryers, and plastered walls. And if you turn on the AC expect a $300 bill.<//Review>

Avoid this place like its the plague! This place has such potential to be an amazing place but it truly is a living nightmare. Lets start with my experience from day 1:

I was moving from Los Angeles to San Diego with my company for a new position. The moving company packed up all my stuff and arrived earlier than I did only to find out that the address on my lease was for a resident already currently living there. I rush down to get there and sure enough, the original lease agent put the incorrect address on the lease thus causing me to pay more money for the moving company.

After I was all settled in everything was great, or so I thought. The first week was filled with a couple 3 doors down waking up the surrounding and across neighbors with their audible fighting. This went on every day for nearly a week and usually between the hours of 12am -3am before they were finally evicted.

Great, now that they took care of that issue, now it has to be smooth sailing. Nope. Before the community took the extreme crack down approach on pool usage, the morons living here treated this place as a Cabo resort. The entire community would be packed with some of the residents family and friend flooding the community making parking impossible and near impossible to find a spot by the pool. Now that they cracked down on it, you have to show ID and are allowed 1 guest... Just one.

Cars and trucks fly through the neighborhood blasting through stop signs like they are Paul Walker and Vin Diesel off to join each other in the sunset. Cars blasting their crappy stock or overly bearing annoying sound system in their cars at night until the early morning is also common if not daily.

As I stated, parking is a damn joke here. I came home late from a business trip (12pm) the week before Thanksgiving and had to be up in 6 hours to get back on a plane for another business trip. I get home and notice someone in my spot (roughly 1am at this point) and figured instead of calling the tow truck company to have them towed, i'll park in the permit parking which is assigned to residents only but not specifically assigned (used for people who have 2 or more people living in the community). Big mistake. Instead of being a nice person and letting it pass, apparently I should have stayed up an extra hour or so to have them towed as my vehicle was towed while I was out of town costing me $700. Of course little could be done at the management office and little care is given.

The reason why this community gives 8 free weeks of rent is due to the fact they struggle with resident retention. Since ive been here (7 months), I've had numerous neighbors move out who moved in after me, more come and go each day.

It really is a shame, this complex could be amazing but it falls short on the entire living experience.< /Review>

Prior to the Irvine Company taking over, I would have rated this place a 5 on their main pool and a 3 on the overall community due to crime, but now I'm rating this a 1.
- Crime has gotten much worse, where there are now squatters living in empty apartments. We pay for security guards to watch the neighborhood, but cops laugh at the amount of crime we have, saying they would never park their cars in our complex.
- The new management has managed to screw everything up. I had to sign-up for paying my water directly to NWP using Irvine's instructions, but then the Irvine company cancelled my account # but continued to bill me through NWP using my old account #, so I couldn't pay it online or over the phone.  The bill was also $180/month for water. Normally this was $40-$50, but after construction crews tapped into our building's water, our "share" increased by 4x. No credit seen as of yet.
- The management team posts notifications on our doors right before major holidays. One posting was to say we need to keep our lights on and trash put away if we are traveling, but their postings basically marked the homes where people were not home. Another posting was that we needed to vacate in January (posted 1 week before Christmas) for building upgrades, or stay through our lease-end and deal with the construction. They said we needed to let them know our January move decision by February 1st...they're idiots.
- We've asked for increased security, but they refuse to fix street lights, security cameras, improve fencing, or even install a gate at the entrance. It's so bad that kids hopped the fence to play basketball on the courts at 2am, and the security couldn't do anything about it as their keys wouldn't let them into the courts (and calling the cops wasn't a part of their escalation matrix).
- The plants are also covered in dog mess.  I blame the pet owners for this, but the management team should be enforcing their pet rules more.

We will be moving to a new place, and I highly recommend anyone searching for cheap places to rent to consider the various comments written about this place pointing out crime, poor management, and pet mess.<//review>

<Review>There is a private security company that patrols the area at night to prevent the high rate of theft and vandalism but from my experience, they are not very effective.  I called security once to file a noise complaint and they blew me off.  They never came and I had to call the police instead.

The management company is hard to get in touch with over the phone.  In my experience, they don't seek to resolve issues but rather try to get you out of their hair and check the box that they "tried" to assist you.

All in all, it is not a bad place to live but there are much better and safer apartments complexes in the area.   I lived in Portofino and recommend it.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
Extremely poor customer service. Rude Leasing/Property Management personnel. Poor attention to detail, poor communication and the failure to listen to a customers needs. Overall negative experience. I will NEVER bring a client or refer someone to this property again. And according to the numerous negative reviews, it appears I am not the only one who feels this way...

As a licensed REALTOR®, it is my job to ensure that I help my clients find the perfect home sweet home! Recently, I was referred some clients who are Military and have just been based and relocated out here to San Diego. They are currently living in a hotel. I did my due diligence and called several complexes in the Mission Valley area. I came across Del Rio, which is a sister property to the Village and also run by the Irvine Company. I spoke with a "leasing specialist" for 20 minutes and went in great detail on the specifics for what my clients were looking for. She insisted that the Village would be the place for them, being that there is a Military discount for a $99 security deposit, and two months free rent on certain floor plans. I asked for the specific floor plans with this special and she then confirmed the availability. There were at least two properties available with this move in special should you sign a lease by 09/20/16. So I set up an appointment for 12:30 that day to come on site and preview the units with my clients at The Village. I was assured that all of the details I went over would be "in the notes" and the team at the Village would take great care of us. Upon arriving, the gentleman at the front desk was very kind and welcoming. He took our info down and then introduced us to Tabitha who would be helping us out. After we sat down, I proceeded to go over the "military special" that I was told about from the person at Del Rio and stated that everything should be in the notes for the properties that we would like to preview. She was rude, uninviting and overall put off the impression that my clients and I were an inconvenience. After about three minutes of her flipping through some papers and basically saying the complete opposite of everything I had discussed with the other off-site team, she made it very clear she had no intentions of helping us or showing any property. She stated that she did not have any available units with the military special available. So I apologized to my clients for wasting their time at this property.

I then called Del Rio to inquire as to why my time was wasted on a wild goose chase to another property that claims they do not have availability? I spoke with Luis, yet another "Leasing Specialist", and he joined in on the confusion. I explained to him what had just transpired and how rudely Tabitha treated us and how she made it pretty clear, she did not want to help out. He stated that he was not sure what was happening because he was looking in their database and he DOES see two units that are available for move in. So which is it, yes or no? I told him we would be willing to go back to The Village to preview them, but we would need to work with someone else who is knowledgeable of the property and at least knows what is available. He said he would speak with his Management team and someone would be in contact with me to coordinate ASAP. So here we are a day later, and I have yet to hear from anyone. Still waiting...</review>

<review>Nice looking but run like a police state.  Bells and whistles with zero substance.  What's the point of paying all this money to be told "you can't" all time?  They ask for ID at the pools.  Who brings a wallet to the pool.  You just saw me open the gate, proving I live here.  They tow cars of residents.  1/2 of the parking spaces are too small. Ridiculous protocols for visitors. Tell your friends to be TSA ready when they visit. Subpar fitness equipment and on top of that they schedule classes in the room with the punching bag when 90% of America gets off work and will kick you out of the room, so you are just SOL.   But hey...taco Tuesday right?
And they response: barely addressed one item here.  Then gave the boiler plate:  "it's not our intent".  Hmm...your execution of common sense does does coincide with your intent.  Further, resort anything is laughable.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Wait until the end of 2014 before considering La Mirage.  By then the refurbishment should be complete and all the annoyance of having ongoing construction work and having HVAC disconnected will be no more.  Also, some of the amenities like the fitness center and oasis pool are closed for use.
I have lived here since 2011 and it was ok before this refurbishment started.  Maybe it will be ok again after it is complete.

Update: Construction still ongoing, staff still incompetent.  Fitness center is opened now so that's a plus. They have removed the heated lap pool and volley ball courts so they can build 90 more apartments.  I doubt that will improve the street parking any once its complete.  On the plus side, because the dummies basically evicted ALL their tenants to due the apartment renovations at least half the apartments seem to be empty and the assigned parking is uncrowded.  So yeah, don't move here yet, give them more time to finish whatever it is they think they are doing.  And while you wait, buy a few lottery tickets, because you'll probably need to win some extra money to afford to live here as they continually raise the rent.<//Text>< user_name>

Do not move in here. They nickle and dime you when you move out and their monthly rates are way over priced. I've had my car towed twice and paid $200 each time because it was a couple hours passed the guest pass time. They will not try to contact you at all before towing. I would give 0 stars if I could.< /review>

<Text>I have lived at this property for over two years and although this community has undergone an extensive remodel and facelift, all the bells, whistles and shinny objects cannot deter from the fact that I would never recommend this place for a working professional.

This property seems to be focus on the "high end, luxury" living; yet the majority of new tents are immature, loud and obnoxious young twenty-somethings that need 3-4 roommates in a 2 bedroom to make rent.

My whole building reeks of weed from other tenants, dogs left off leashes and punk kids literally drag racing everyday in and round our complex while blaring music at 11pm on week nights.

On several occasions we have had, guests/venders and even new tenants with moving trucks blocking assigned parking and the office and "security" best solution was this problem was " We are sorry for the inconvenience, but it you just wait a couple hours I'm sure they will be gone" yet, if my wife's spot is block she has to park on the street and if she parks on the street she will get towed because they only give one "permit" pass for the per unit  without paying an extra 300$ a year.

lastly assigned parking spots were taken from us by the property management within the first 6 months or so of signing our lease due to the "unfair parking arrangements" of other tenants even though it was negotiated at the time of signing our lease. Now I have to park almost 2 blocks away for my "permitted spot"

The best description I can give is this property is a beautiful woman with an intolerable and fake personality. better off looking someplace else.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Don't move here. It's a joke all they care about is your money. If you over pay on a Security Deposit they will just put it somewhere else without your consent. While living their it was always noisy, theft,(motorcycles, mail left at your door,bikes) and people letting their kids running around without being supervised. Some of the pipes leak in the parking garages; our windshield has a white stain on it from something leaking. This is no where near luxury living.<//Text>< Pics>

It's hard to imagine something that looks so perfect could be such a disaster, but here we are. The fact that we are paying higher than the median average for a two-bedroom apartment for a one bed-room apartment would be a small price and minor inconvenience if we were getting the services we are told we have, but that is just not the case.
We have "a courtesy patrol" with zero ability to do anything in terms of problem solving, yet we have at least a dozen people on staff here. I pay $300 for my parking spot. I constantly have nowhere to park. This isn’t because guests are parking in permitted areas, it’s because residents with assigned spots are. There are approximately 15 permit spots outside my building. On any given night you can find between 3-6 unpermitted residents parked there. I have called the “courtesy patrol” on SEVERAL occasions and have either been blown off completely or told that they can’t tow residents. WHAT? THEY ARE IN A PERMITTED/PAID FOR PARKING SPOT!!!!!!! I’ve actually walked to the front of the complex to the “courtesy patrol” booth to physically walk them back to my apartment to make sure they at least ticket (not a monetary ticket) these residents so they know that they aren’t supposed to be parking in permit spots, but residents know they won’t get towed so they do it anyways. Why am I paying $300 dollars to park?
“Courtesy patrol” and the pool area: first off, there is a two guest per household at the pool rule. This is not enforced at all. I’m not against people having a good time, but it’s amazing how two or three LARGE groups of people can take over the entire three-pool area very easily. I don’t understand how groups of (up to ten people, no joke) can stroll past the security gate out front with coolers and in bathing suits and not draw some questions from the “courtesy patrol’ stationed at the front of the property. The pool is beautiful, but it’s not club med. I don’t pay 2100 a month for a one-bedroom apartment to not be able to use my facilities.
But there is the occasional off-day I am able to actually utilize the amenities. My little brother came to visit san diego for the first time. We brought all the essentials to the pool and were throwing one of those Velcro-tennisball things when we were told by “courtesy patrol” that we weren’t allowed to throw balls or play games in the pool area because it could be unsafe. We were in the turf are by the grills and such right next to TWO SETS OF HAMMERED PEOPLE PLAYING CORNHOLE. What? When I asked about the difference, I was shrugged off and the others were left be completely. The “courtesy patrol” that came over had previously been chatting with a group of people that had glass bottles of alcohol (both not allowed in the pool are for actual safety and legal reasons) which were completely ignored so I could be told not to throw a tennis ball six-feet to my sober brother. Don’t pick and choose which rules you want to follow so you have a feeling of importance. That’s just bad work ethic. This particular incident earned me a free rental of the party room above the clubhouse, when I called to inform the management team. Nice, but totally not practical and it was still going to cost me deposits and cleaning fees. I appreciate the offer, but I have no reason to rent out that huge space, regardless of how much it usually costs.
There was a fire here one night. As my girlfriend was telling me I jumped online to try and call “courtesy patrol” but was sent to TWO different voicemail systems. There was a fire and there was nobody here I could call. Me and my girlfriend put it out with pots of water. When the fire department arrived (because someone else had called them) I came out and asked the “courtesy patrol” for a working number, which he didn’t know. I was given the same number I had called and told to wait for the number to press that would allow me to leave a message. ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WHY ARE WE PAYING FOR ALL OF THESE PEOPLE TO WORK HERE TO DRIVE AROUND ON GOLFCARTS AND HARRASS RESIDENTS ON A WHIM?
This place is broken.< /text>

You are correct, we do offer a different amenity package in one of the four villages on site. The Reflection Village has KitchenAid appliances and is the only village to have gas, thus adding additional value to apartments in this location. Pest control treatments are offered weekly at no cost to our residents should they experience any pests in their home. Due to the state of drought in California, ants are motivated to search for food and water sources indoors for their survival.

<rating>1</rating><Review>I will  not give a star on this apartment. Yes they improved the amenities but they also put more rules that are vague. Their staff are horrible, when I moved in last May, I provided them all the things needed (SDGE account number, Renters Ins #) so all we need to do is pick up the keys. Then when the moved in date came, the person who have all the info was off and the staff asked me to call the offices for SDGE and renters ins # again to get those numbers because I didn't have it with me as I already give it to them. The movers have to wait so I can open the door to my unit. I cannot believe that the office don't have access to those documents I provided them earlier and their lack of communication internally causes us to suffer in the end.
Now when we moved in, we are bombarded by calls from the office that you cannot do this or that like you cannot leave your slippers outside the door, you cannot play in the pool, you cannot bring alcohol anymore that you have to buy it now from their café which is ridiculously expensive than buying it yourself. You cannot hang your clothes outside the patio and so many other stuff.
Plus they (Staff) themselves don't know the rules because they give different opinions or interpretations which causes the tenant to be more stress. One officer would say yes its allowed then one would say its not, then later one would correct themselves but the tenant was already been agitated.
Why are they not very specific on the rules and regulation? If their staff themselves don't understand the policies and have different opinion or interpretations, how can we the tenant understand this.
I don't know if the owner of this business see what is happening here. Its a lot of bullshit going on and not sure where they are hiring these people or who is putting these guidelines or rules.
We tried to argue about bringing our alcohol on the main pool because that was allowed before until they build their own café and now its restricted. They say we can do that on the 2 small pool so I get ballistic. We didn't signed for the small pool, we are attracted on the main one. They could have secluded their café which they have fence already and let people use the amenities that they are accustomed to.
Anyway very frustrating guys. this place will be empty if the owner wont act on this and frankly there are a lot of apartments being build around the area which could compete on this. Unless someone is sabotaging this business that the owner is not aware off lol</Review>< pictures>

<Review>After 4 years of making payments and just two months away from owning my motorcycle  it was stolen out of my parking garage. Spoke with security "supervisor" once I realized the bike was stolen to see if his night shift guys saw anything and he said, "our guys are pretty lazy, they don't even go inside the parking garages." Question: Why pay for security if they aren't going to do their job? Place is way overpriced and your things are not safe. I grew up in Chula Vista and National City for past 24 years leaving my bike on the streets where some would say isn't the best neighborhood and my bike was fine. I lived here for 4 months in what you would think would be a safe secure community and it's stolen. Good thing my room mate is deploying and we can break our lease.

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Great place to get away for a quick bite. Pastor tacos on the weekends is something u must try. Friendly environment, 21+ can have a cold beer and eat some great Mexican food at the same time. They have one T.V. you can watch sports or other shows. Must try the pastor tacos tho. I posted up a pic of my pastor tacos with no onions cause of my wifey or else I'd add the onions. I ain't scared. Lol. Hope this review helps out. Have a good day.< /review><gmap_id>0x80ec1eecc7e5a3fd:0x4d74dc9a030eccb7</gmap_id>< resp>

<Name>Samuel Champaign<//Name><text>Unfortunately......customer service in Lompoc seriously lacks! More of a positive attitude from the cooks would bring more business. But it's Lompoc, CA. Too bad it's far off from the 101. Hopefully they can raise the bar a little. Businesses here don't usually last too long. There's always room for improvement.< /text>< rating>

I had a great experience.  Farzaneh helped me and she was very good.  She listened to me which was great.   I have hard to find veins and have had issues in the past with other technicians that want to do it their way and not listen to me.  It was painless and quick.   I recommend Quest Diagnostics for getting your blood testing.  Thank you Farzenah for being great at your job!< /text>

He put the needle in my vain a few times and he was twisting it and couldn’t find the main one. I asked for someone with more experience she could find it but after she was done I got a big bruise on my arm and it was sooo tense that o freaked out. I wanted to talk to the manager but it was already closed. Please don’t go to this location. They don’t know what they are doing. It’s not obvious in the pic but it hurt a lot.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Anytime I need to get blood work done, I come here at 7am and wait less than 15 minutes (more like 3 mins). This morning Katie did my blood draw and I barely felt a thing. Most of the phlebotomists are good but she was extra gentle and friendly.</Text><userid>103668958491908112446<//userid>< pictures>

<text>Honestly my appointment went as quick/smooth as it could. I arrived at 2pm and was done in 10 mins. Everyone including the front desk, technician was very friendly and had clear communication. Almost felt nothing when she took my blood. I don’t know why this place has a low rating. Maybe some people didn’t have an appointment and they had to wait a long time? I booked my appointment over the phone and it was easy, so I think you should definitely make an appointment.</text>< Pictures>

<review>This is a building problem. I visited this morning and found that the elevators were not operating. At my age, it was very difficult walking up and down 3 long fights of stairs. In addition, the parking gate was not operational. Others were having the same problem. It took 30 minutes to finally locate the maintenance man. He has to go out and physically operate the gate to allow me to exit!! By this time, there were other vehicles waiting to exit too.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

They get the needle out like it small blood vessels are damaged. Healthcare provider inserts the needle but while removing it , there wasn't enough pressure applied after the needle is removed. My daughter is suffering from pain in hand from last 1 week continuously and even I don't have any direct contact to Quest diagnostic to talk on this. Later I have to visit my Physician.< /Text>

This is the most inefficient, frustrating way of making an appointment I have ever experienced.  I finally just gave up.< /Review>

<text>unbelieveable to navigate their appointment system.don't even try unless you are !00% computer literate.took me 15 minutes to make my appointment.would not let me put in my phone number several times.had to start all over each time.instead,call their phone number, and go through their automated system.the staff is excellent; however, i would go to another lab if it were more convenient.<//text>< resp>

Based on the reviews I read I was a little concerned about going to this office. My experience was great. I had made an appointment and got there early and they took me right away.
The phlebotomist Malu was great. Not only was she warm and attentive but she was so good I barely felt the stick.
I will definitely go back here.<//text>

This place sucks.  Why have a phone number if you can't speak to a person.  A phone that offers only recorded info is a fabulous way to tell your customers that you don't give a f$#) about them.  I am all about using the website but what I needed was not there and would take 5 seconds for a person to answer.< /Text>

< review>
I had a 7:45am appointment. The Tech seemed like she was in a rush. I didn't catch her name but she had dark hair and was in the very last station. When it was time to take my blood, she prepped my arm. I usually turn away during the stick, so I wasn't looking, but after the initial pinch there was a sharp tingling pain that traveled the length of my arm. I immediately turned to look what happened and no blood was coming out. The tech had to pull it back and fish a little to find my vein. My gut is that she when thru my vein. I unfortunately had to leave right away because I was gonna be late for work, but I was able to call the office. I spoke with the supervisor named Kelsey. She apologized, and said that she would forward the information to the manager and they would follow up with me to see how I was doing. She said to call if I had any questions and explained some of the symptoms that I might get for a day or so. She mentioned that there is always a high risk that this will happen, but also stated that the tech should have known better. I did call on Monday to speak about my arm still tingling, and the person that answered the phone said that she would have the Manager call me about it. I received no call. I ended up going to my doctor and asking my questions there. My doctor was more than a little surprised that this happened. In their opinion, I apparently am an easy stick. She asked if the tech was a student, and I stated no. My doctor stated that this is a common mistake for students, but an experienced tech would not have done this. My doctor then informed me that my symptoms would be there for possibly a week. It is now FRIDAY. NO ONE has called me. NO ONE has followed up. I don't even know if my issue was even escalated to the Manager because when I originally asked for them on Monday the person that answered was hesitant to even let me talk to them. I told them what happened and she seemed very uninterested and unconcerned. I obviously don't need medical assistance any longer, since I have already gone to my doctor with my concerns. But, from the stand point of customer service, you should consider actually following thru with your patients. ESPECIALLY, when your technician was at fault.< /review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>We received substandard customer service today at this location.  When requesting a note for my daughter's school to excuse her from missing her 7:00 a.m. class, we were told by the "Group Lead" that they "don't give those letters out."  This is the first time we have been told that.  This was our third visit to this location in 3 months for our daughter because she has a standing order.  When I told the "Group Lead" that we had gotten the forms from them as recently as one month ago he told me "whoever gave you that was not supposed to."  He was rude.  He was condescending.  His behavior was unacceptable.

At that point another employee came to our rescue.  She was pleasant and kind and told the "Group Lead" where to find the forms.  He told her that they were "not supposed to give them out."  She ignored his ridiculous refusals to help us and got the form for us.

A few questions:
Why does Quest have the forms, if they are "not supposed to give them out?"
What is a student supposed to do to get readmitted to school?
Why were we treated like we were trying to perpetrate some sort of fraud?  We were only trying to get the appropriate paperwork to get our daughter readmitted to school.< /Text>< pictures>

Have surgery coming up, went to get labs done. And the tech didn't even order them as stat as the order stated. Now getting a call that surgery might be cancelled due to an ignorant and naive error the tech made. He was a tall Hispanic guy, more interested in my day then obviously ordered my test right! And the waiting room was empty. So it's not like he was in a rush! I would advise go to lab Corp they order labs as ordered, wait is long but the job gets done right! DO NOT COME HERE. People life's for techs error.<//text>

Everything has been great for me.

I've been to this office before and didn't have the bad experience conveyed by others. So I wanted to give them another chance.

Before I start, I'm not denying anyone else's experience and the bad reviews here. I'm just conveying my experience which happens to be different. Take that as you will.

But as to "no more walk-ins", that's completely incorrect. The phone line for Quest says "walk-ins are always welcome". I called for an appointment but it said the earliest available slot was in two days. I already fasted for a blood test so I just went in. There is a sign-in sheet for appointments and walk-ins. Hardly anyone was there (Wednesday AM). I got in with no problem.

I was told that on Saturdays they get a lot of people with appointments and the walk-ins fill up the rest of the schedule early in the morning. That's basic "first-come first-serve", and "overflow" can't be served. That's just a matter of basic resources - limits on personnel and time. So yes, it's possible that some people will get turned away if they see the schedule is completely filled.

As to wait time, it really depends on when you get there and pure luck. You can't call to find out how busy they are. A lot of people with appointments don't show up, but if they do then walk-ins need to wait behind them.

They do more than blood there, it's all body fluids, so wait time is not just dependent on whether you're getting a blood test or something else. If you really just need blood work, consider another an office that doesn't provide all of the other services too.

My personal experience today, Wednesday 9/28: I got in at 9:30AM, was called in at 9:40ish after they processed about 3 other people. The phlebotomist was done with me by 9:47. I had to give them urine and was out of the office by 9:55. I've had to wait longer in the past but I was still in and out within an hour. Working for myself I can get in while other people work 9-5 jobs. That's a huge factor which makes it more difficult for 9-5 workers and students but good for others like seniors.

As to quality and service. My contact was cordial and professional, efficient during the blood draw, conversational but not overly chatty. This was the best possible experience.

As a side note, there is a small street that goes around the parking lot and there is usually a space available, so it's free parking there if you can walk up a couple steps to get to the building. I don't know if they charge for parking in the lot but in my few visits I've never had to find out.

Everywhere we go we will find occasional delays and bad service, and we should report it in review places like this. But we should also balance the good experience reviews with the bad to see if a place has frequent problems or if there was just a bad day or two. Given my experiences which have been completely different from some others here, I'd say this place is fine with occasional common issues. For me a lot more bad reports would be needed for me to second-guess that impression.

I hope that helps others...< /review>

(Translated by Google) Before and after the three men, three pumping, pumped up a little, not enough to blame the patient blood pumping too dry or cry. But old patient, not only did not cry, has endured quietly sobbing, really rubbish blood technician.

(Original)
前后三个人，抽了三次，抽到了一点，抽不够怪病人血太干或是哭。病人不过几岁，不仅没有大哭，一直忍着小声啜泣，真是垃圾抽血技师。</text>

<Review>I love this place! It's so much fun for all ages, even for adults. I would to say this is like a Subway but with arts and crafts. You build it the way you like it,  there are so many toppings to choose from, and finish it with off with the dressing of your choice. My 3yr old loves the projects.
Covid19 has made it a little challenging to keep my little girl busy, but I had a project delivered right to my door! Hand delivered! This is a small family operated business that really makes you feel like part of the family. Thank you Heidi and Charlie, you guys are truly wonderful people.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

This is the most adorable, unique and fun place ever. My sister in law is a teacher and she has brought my daughter here before just for fun on a Saturday. We had my daughters birthday here and it was so much fun for the kids and adults. Arts and crafts are always a sure win with my family, so this place is so perfect. I absolutely recommend this establishment.❤</Text>

If she were just a little gruff in general, it would have been fine, but she was much warmer to the next child and seemed to offer my daughter less than the other kids. Perhaps my daughter annoyed her? I'm not really sure, but I'm not impressed.</Review><pics>None</pics>< rate>

Very attentive staff and lots of different options to choose from for the kids.

The only thing I can complain about is their bathroom. There's only one and kids spend a long time washing their hands in there so the wait can be long at times. Maybe they should consider having a standalone sink for hand washing to lessen the load on the toilet.<//text>

Great place for children's  parties,  and adult get togethers especially if you  enjoy painting and making things by hand. Family owned and great service. Prices are reasonable. I've been  there a few times never  been disappointed with the experience  and my kids love it as well.</Text>

I love this place. When we come home each Christmas he comes to make a new hand and I have them all. Love this place. Great place to meet your child paint, be creative, and not deal with the news. Ooh and you get a cute project at the end.< /Text>

We had my seven year old daughter's party at the Sawdust Factory.  We all had a great great time.  The staff was wonderful with the kids.  We brought food for the kids and adults.  The kids loved painting and my daughter was proud to put her hand print on the wall.  Thanks very much.<//Text>

This place could probably be one of the best places ive ever took my kids to. This lady Hiedi, i dont know what her position is, but she is really rude and doesnt let kids be kids. She treats the other employees like they are dumb and raises her voice when something isnt done her way. Is this lady wasnt there today it would he an easy 5 stars. If you go make sure she isnt there to ruin the experience.< /text>

<Text>I've been to a lot of antique stores before, but never like this one. I didn't fully experience and walk around the store fully because I was filled with a lot of emotion. It's not a bad thing, but rather good. I was slapped with memories that I haven't thought of in....... well since I last experienced them. This store felt like I was walking into past, like I was actually walking inside my memories. It was a good cry back to memory lane.

There is parking in front of the store and on the side, but go for the side parking. It'll be much easier to get back onto the road. The moment I walked in I was pessimistic due to the fact they had an old wheel chair in foyer. I walked in and I was literally surprised. It wasn't cluttered and I didn't feel bombarded with a mountain of junk. This place was clean too. The floor was open and the antiques and not much older items was spread out nicely. They had some really nice vintage items and items my grandparents had as wells as my mom's. That is why I was flushed with emotional tears.  LOL I started thinking to myself....."So, this is the place where our things went when we can't find it, or lose them, or throw them away. Maybe my personal gremlin owns that store and he was selling me my things back." The guy inside was really cool. He didn't follow me or kept an eye on me and just let me browse around. Not like other antique stores were they follow you around with their peripheral or pretend to put things away. It's unfortunate I didn't walk around the store fully because there were a lot of things that reminded me of my grandparents and my mom. I would totally recommend this place.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>A "smaller" antiques shop with carefully selected merchandise. Friendly, knowledgeable employees present America's history through "items not lost in time." Rather than stuff every square inch, Main Street Antiques allows you to step back and inspect what interests you.  Free parking. Wheelchair accessible.<//Review><user_id>111644673136196029337< /user_id>< Rating>

My husband and I have gotten some great finds here in the past, but since their employees don't wear masks inside the store we've stopped going. I tried (more than once)....and now they're just off our list of places to shop locally.</Text>

<Text>It's a very tiny plaza but it's got some good businesses there. Little Caesars, a pet store, PG& E, a bakery., And a micro brewery pub that serves good food. Other shops come and go. The plaza has nice plantings and it's kind of well kept up. There is a smoke shop that caters to sketchy people so hold on to your bag and don't talk to strangers. You will get asked for smokes and for money by those that hang out there. Not fun.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><name>donna mayle<//name>< Rating>

Ok, I went to Clocktower Plaza because there is PG&E office and pay my electricity bill.
But also there is Little Caesar Pizzeria and my grandsons love that pizza, plus one of my granddaughter is working there.
Very good service and if you call on time you get your pizza ready when you get there.
And also there is a car wash there too, the name of the car wash is: PINGUINOS they clean your car or truck very good.<//Review>

Decent selection of second-hand stuff at Forgiving Paws. And they are great supporters of the pet rescue community in San Benito County.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) If I like it, it's where gas is cheaper, I think it's not the best quality, but sometimes we have to use it.

(Original)
Si me gusta es donde esta más barato el gas, creo k no es la mejor calidad pero pues en algunas ocasiones tenemos k hacer uso de el.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Rate>4</Rate><Date>1560921691255<//Date>< Gmap_id>

customer service is really good.  I went here to get fitted for a rucksack.  The sales personnel was helpful, store was organized and clean.  too bad they don't price match even after i showed them the add from another sports store ($50 less).</review>

Andy's Hardware is an exceptional neighborhood convenience stop for all of your DIY projects. The store has been adding new assortments of product recently and I can't wait to see what they bring in next. The employees were very helpful and friendly as well...I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for their basic hardware needs.<//Text>

<review>This place is so professional and inviting. The sales people who helped us pick out our 1st wedding ring were amazing to us. They took the time to explain everything and made sure we were comfortable and got everything exactly as we wanted it. I couldn’t recommend them enough! And the prices.. they are amazing. Great diamonds, great prices and great people. (I apologize to the two amazing young ladies that helped us, I’ve waited so long to review you guys that I’ve forgotten your names, you know who you are 😉)<//review>< Rate>

<Review>What can I say that hasn't already been said? I have been coming here for almost 15 years. Best service, best prices, and most important of all- best quality. I love that they give me the ability to pick something from the extravagant class all the way to the vest value class. Can't find the perfect piece? They have custom made pieces for me to make it exactly how I envisioned  They will work with your budget and give you the best quality for the best price.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dccd3a4dd1554d:0xeb14fcf270386e92<//Gmap_id><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

What great people!  Patiently attended to our every desire and change in direction. The end result was two beautiful rings that could not have turned out any better. Take your jewelry business to Diamond & Design Jewelers - you won’t regret it!< /text>

Back at Diamond and design to pick up a watch for my sister. Once again I was greeted with my name and a smile. Linda helped me with the watch ,and the young lady who gave me my receipt, even sent me on my way with a complimentary bottle of cold water. As I mentioned in my last review, this is a great place for jewelry at excellent prices and great serves for watch repair and batteries. Ask for Linda.<//text>

<Review>From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm welcome, an offer for a beverage and a snack and lots of support from the experts to make sure I was getting what I wanted, even if I had no idea what I wanted.

Homeira and Atila run a very respectable family business. They truly are the best at what they do. You can tell how much they enjoy it, which is a pleasure in itself. They have the respect of their clients as well as the solid relationships with the diamond suppliers to get the best of the best.

When it came to choosing the right diamond, Atila's GIA certification (takes major school time) came into play. He knew exactly how to simply explain the diamond ratings to help me feel know about the process. The diamonds he buys on a weekly basis are top quality, but also are packed with extreme value. He used his skills to  suggest several that would meet my need. I'm picky because my gf is picky, but I'm also indecisive so this is a combination for failure. Well, it was a challenge that Atila met wholeheartedly and he didn't quit until we found just the right one....which ultimately was the very first combination he suggested lol. Bless you Atila!

Without a doubt,  I will always trust Diamond & Design with all my future diamond/jewelry needs. Now, hoping Atila can use his skills to plan an amazing engagement party...</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Rafael Baltodano< /name></record>

He really took the stress away from the decision making process and went the extra mile to make sure I was comfortable with my purchase. His assistants Melanie and Michelle were also very pleasant and patient with me on each of my 3 visits. What I thought was going to be a nerve wrecking experience turned out to be amazing!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Amazing diamonds, service and pricing. I bought an engagement ring for my now Fiancé and I cannot thank Atilla and Diamond and Design enough. They custom made the perfect ring that she absolutely loves. Ended up being slightly to big and Atilla had it re-sized perfectly 48 hours later. Highly recommend.</Review><UserId.>115671505597367495547</UserId.></record>

Went in on a whim (no recommendations no looking at reviews); just looked up jeweler online and this came up. SOOOO LUCKY I went here to make my purchase. I was greeted so well and felt like a guest and not a customer. That's why I gave them my business. Linda walked me through everything and was the absolute best. I will make sure shes there everytime I go back. Hoping to create a lifetime relationship with this business, that's how great I felt. Will be back! Again, Linda rocks<//review>

< Review>
Homeira & Atila Ghassemi, owners, are very knowledgeable Jewelers who aim to please and I trust them. They always want to be sure I'm satisfied with my "investments" and back each item with a warranty. They, together with Linda, Michelle & Melanie give wonderful customer service and they all know my name! This makes me feel so welcome. And not only do they offer to clean my rings whenever I pass by, but I am always offered chilled water (today Linda made me hot tea for my soar throat). Diamond & Desigb Jewelers is also a beautiful "one stop shop" for me whenever I need watch batteries, jewelry repair or polishing (thank you). I highly recommend them🤍< /Review>

I am have been shopping  at diamond design for about 7 years that started with my wife’s engagement rings. My most recent purchase was for a set of earrings for my daughter of two years. The earrings were excellent and great value. Unfortunate the stems of the earring were too long for my daughter. I reached out to Atila at the store to see what we can do. i have to say that the team went above and beyond in trying to solve my issue . At the end , they decided to order a new custom pair for her. Thank you Atila, excellent customer service and will definitely return for our future needs for quality jewelry .</review>

Wow these guys surprised me more every time.
The customer service and attention to detail is second to none.... even with this world pandemic these guys keep it 100% professional.
As a Fireman we are super busy and hands on. I  knocked a diamond out of my wedding ring and I called to see if they are open. Atila the owner called me back and made an appointment to see him the next day ....... Conclusion five days later I have my ring In perfect condition he had it polished and all the scratches removed it looks brand new amazing work once again guys. I have recommend Diamond & Disign in the past to  my fellow fireman with 100% satisfaction every time. I definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a fine, Unique, Or custom piece of piece of jewelry. Very honest and helpful in my experiences.
Be Safe

<Review>If you're looking for incredible diamond jewelry, look no further! Atila is a consummate professional, being personable and understanding of his clients' desires as well as knowledgeable of his trade. He takes the time to truly know what a client really wants, and then works to find or create the perfect piece of jewelry to match. Everywhere my fiancée goes, she receives compliments on her ring. She loves it! Diamond and Design is the most user-friendly jewelry store I have purchased from and will have all of my business in the future. Thank you for everything Atila!</Review>< Pictures>

From the nonchalant “let’s just browse at rings” to the fiancé getting the perfect stone, setting, and size....made my job easy. Looking back, everything went perfectly - I could not ask for more.

What an amazing place!  Atila was so helpful and really went above and beyond to help me find the perfect ring.  I was searching for months to get the right stone and went to so many stores.  Many of the places I went to were geared towards the up sell and didn't really listen to what I was looking for. From beginning to end, Atila was a pleasure to work with and really worked with me instead of pushing a hard sell.  Even with an epidemic shutting the world down, Atila did all he could to let me know what was going on in the process.  The ring turned out great and my Fiancé and everyone else that has seen the ring have had nothing but amazing things to say about Atila's work. I will definitely return here for our custom wedding bands!  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for that special piece of jewelry for anyone in their life.< /text>

< review>
My husband purchased my engagement ring from Diamond & Design Jewelers, and it was the best decision! The staff are friendly, willing to go out of their way to make you content and comfortable. My husband mentioned the process was so easy, and Atila & staff were so knowledgeable, friendly, affordable, and solely wanted to create something that was specific and special to the couple. It’s been a pleasure working with them, and I know I’ll be back. I’d like to add one more small detail, that I don’t see other jewelers doing.. Diamond & Design will bend over backwards for you, and I mean that in all seriousness.
I needed my rings cleaned within a day (usually it takes longer if you ask any other jeweler) but they prioritized me first, and got it done even though I gave them a tight squeeze.
It’s small businesses like this that we need to support. The ones that care, that will give us QUALITY, a supportive staff. I feel like I left diamond & design with a new friend. I never once felt like they were cheating me throughout the process.
You should stop reading this review because I’m going to go on and on... you might as well just go drive on over there!
Thank you Atila & staff for creating such a gorgeous diamond ring for me, you guys will always be in our hearts! We’ll see you soon!!!<//review>

The genuine service that this store offers is unique in today’s number driven retail industry, they listen and work with you until you find the perfect purchase.

Diamond & Design are the best jewelers in SoCal. Stop going to big name jewelry stores that don’t give you any deals and their quality is no where near Diamond & Design. Every time my husband and I come in they know us by name and greet us with a warm welcome. They truly know customer service and how to make customers for life. We will never go anywhere else for our jewelry needs.</text>

<Review>The highest quality jewelry and customer service. I’m very particular when it comes to jewelry and only consider the highest quality, one of a kind items. After discussing a variety of great options for my goddaughter, including a couple custom made pieces, Attila Helped me settle on exactly the nameplate bracelet I was looking for. Big thank you to Mr. Ghasemi and his professionalism throughout the process. Highly Recommended< /Review>< user_id>

We Diamond & Design! We’ve purchased several pieces from them and their prices are always very competitive and fair. Not to mention the high quality of their jewelry and the one of kind pieces they offer.

They are most definitely our “go to” in quality jewelry!!<//review>

I went in looking for a watch battery replacement. They told me the work would take about 5 days from the Saturday I dropped it off. The clerk's were super friendly as they offered to clean my wife's wedding ring free of charge. The battery was replaced and stamped with a 1 year warranty. I will be back here for sure.

I came to Diamond and Design with my boyfriend in February as our first stop to look for engagement rings. We were offered a glass of champagne and began exploring our different options. Atila was so patient in showing us all the different options in bands, settings, and explaining important factors in selecting the diamond. I had an idea from browsing online of the diamond shapes I liked, but not until I tried different diamonds on my hand was I really able to narrow down what I wanted for my future ring.

I recently got engaged and I absolutely LOVE my ring. I really could not have asked for a better engagement ring or overall experience. I never felt pressured or rushed in my appointment which you often feel the minute you walk into other jewelry stores. From start to finish Atila did a wonderful job in communicating with myself and my fiancé and making our dream engagement come true.

I can’t wait to make my next purchase and highly recommend this store to anyone in the market for jewelry!<//Review>

<Review>I recently worked with Atila and Homeira to create a beautiful engagement ring for my fiancé. The staff here are very friendly and were happy to answer any questions I had during the process. I really appreciated Atila taking the time to explain the diamonds, cuts, quality etc because I had no idea what to look for prior to coming into D&D. I was honestly pretty intimidated by the process before starting but they made it so easy. Since then I’ve brought in an old broken necklace belonging to my mom and they were able to repair it and plated it with white gold. The necklace now looks better than new and my mom was thrilled she could wear her jewelry again! We will definitely be coming back for our wedding bands.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
My fiance recently took me to go choose our wedding bands from Diamonds & Designs, who he was referred to by a friend.  I truly had the best experience choosing from their wonderful selection of diamond rings.
From One-Of-A-Kinds to well known Top Designer diamond settings and wedding bands, they had the most beautiful selection, even for men!  They would have even made me a custom designed wedding ring if I needed them to.  What I loved about walking in to this jewelry store is that they made us feel at home.  They are a family owned and operated establishment that truly catered to ever detail I had envisioned for my Wedding Ring.  Oh, and my fiance didn't faint over the prices, so that was a plus!!  Thank you Atilla for being so wonderful, and I look forward to giving you all my business in the the future.   You guys are the best!!<//Review>

My husband and I love Diamond and Design. They are always professional, helpful and willing to design a piece if you cannot find what you are looking for in the store.

They are not only our Personal Jewelers now but we are proud to say they are our in our circle of friends. Our daughters and their husbands have now become customers as well.

Thank you so much for everything you do!!

I started my journey/process of getting engaged knowing absolutely nothing about diamonds and rings. Diamond & design was highly recommended to me by friends. Before visiting, I did a ton of research to get a good idea of what matters in diamonds and the price range. Atila answered all of my many questions, helped guide me in finding that perfect ring, and delivered an absolutely stunning ring that I never thought I would be able to get with my budget in mind. Now my fiance gets compliments every day on her ring, with ladies saying "if I did it all over I'd want a ring like that". The fire and cut of this diamond are amazing! Definitely give these guys a visit for any of your jewelry needs.< /text>

<text>Needed to get my watch serviced and resurfaced over the holidays and Atila was able to take it in last minute. Let me tell you , the finished product is comparable to the 10 year challenge everyone's been doing. The service was A5. Price was more than fair. Quality of work, well you just have to see for yourself.</text>< name>

They didn’t  even try to come close to offering a fair price. When a Pawn Shop offers more than 57% more than they do, then you know there is a problem. They are more than happy to point out problems and make it seem like they would be doing YOU a favor by giving you anything at all. However, when I turned down their outrageously low offer they seemed disappointed. With so many jewelers around why bother with one so willing to rip a person off.  If they can so easily take advantage of you in that way, what else might they do?  I would definitely recommend a place with more integrity for your jewelry needs.<//Review>< pics>

{'time': 1512680057549, 'text': 'Hi Carissa! I find the review a little off as everyone notes that we pay the highest prices on scrap gold in our area. I pay at over 75% of scrap price so perhaps there was a little confusion there or they weren’t offering you a SCRAP price at the pawn shop (which would be unusual). In thirteen years this would be the first time I’ve been told a pawn shop beat our price. I had a lady come in just yesterday who said a local chino pawn shop offered her $350 for something she ended up selling to me for $1080. .. that’s a big difference, so I’m not really sure what happened - perhaps you have the wrong store. I would also stop short of stating we rip people off as we are a small business that run our business based on honesty and building relationships... unfortunately, we can’t make everyone happy all of the time. Have a great day. Thank you.'}<//Response>

<text>I first visited Diamond and Design in 2015 when my best friend was getting her diamond upgraded on her engagement ring. At the same time, Atila helped make me an engagement ring profile for the special day when my boyfriend would finally ask me to marry him. I slipped my boyfriend Atila’s card and 3 years later my boyfriend gave me the ring of my dreams. I was amazed that Diamond and Design kept my profile for that long. Atila was wonderful with working with my now husband to ensure every little detail on my ring was perfect.

Since then, my husband and I have bought several pieces from Diamond and Design and will continue to do so. Everyone is so warm and welcoming! Atila is very informative and patient. I’ve gone back numerous times because of my own personal issues with my ring sizing. He always ensured that I left feeling comfortable and 100% satisfied.

So, if you’re thinking about visiting Diamond and Design, stop thinking and pay them a visit! You’ll be happy you did!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dccd3a4dd1554d:0xeb14fcf270386e92<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Atila at Diamond and Design made the experience of me buying an engagement ring not only easy and enjoyable, but quite memorable. Buying an engagement ring was such an intimidating task for me initially with hundreds of different options (both ring wise and financially) until I came into contact with Atila. He asked me the important questions, made it easy for me to describe the type of ring I wanted, and provided me with many different options, all of which were financially appropriate and of stunning quality. He also helped develop a nice financial plan for me. Overall this was an incredibly pleasant process which made the whole act of asking a very special person a very important question enjoyable and memorable. I would definitely suggest Atila's services to any friend and will come to him with all of my jewelry questions in the future. Thank you for making this such an easy and memorable process for me Atila! Words cannot explain how happy I am with the beautiful finished product (the ring was more beautiful than I could have imagined)<//text>

Such an amazing experience at Diamond and Design! My husband surprised me with the most beautiful wedding ring upgrade when our second baby boy was born, all with the help of their expert jewelers! We decided to upgrade my husband's ring as well, and I was so impressed with the time and consideration Atila took to help us find the perfect ring. We are always treated like family, and love the Ghassemi family! I highly recommend them to anyone looking for amazing customer service and design. They never disappoint!<//Review>

I basically got twice the Diamond in white gold vs. sterling silver. Not to mention the custom piece was done in two days.

Homeira and Atila are amazing. They have made my experience in shopping for engagement ring and wedding band a very pleasant one.

They were very honest - the environment is very comfortable where they allow you to shop freely without any pressure.

They work very hard to provide the best value within my budget and I was able to buy the most beautiful Ring for my fiancé, as she is beyond happy and grateful of my choice.

The service is also very fast and efficient - I had to re-sized my fiancé'/ ring twice and Atila was able to get it done with reasonable time.

I would highly recommend people who is shopping for any jewelry needs at Diamond & Design.

Thank You</review>

After testing it, we found that it needed to be cut to determine if it was gold and I needed my gold guy to do that. As I told you that day, I will happily polish the part I used to determine if it was gold or not. It will only take about 15 minutes for my jeweler to do. You can still bring that by any time and we will fix it for you. Thanks and have a good day.'}</response>

Great place to go and dine inside now. The servers wore masks and greeted us to be seated. Restaurant recommends masks to be worn. Food was delicious and plentiful. It's clean inside restaurant and restrooms.< /Review>

It was our first time here. All I can say is that it was AWESOME! The food was delicious, the place was clean, very relaxed atmosphere. The staff was very nice. My sons meal was free, which is great. The burger I got was delicious, perfectly cooked. Great place in San Jacinto for good food that's not a chain restaurant. Definitely recommend going there. Can't wait to go back and try other food.<//review>

< Review>
Phoned in two breakfast orders for pick up through drive thru. First was the meat lovers skillet with biscuits and gravy and eggs over medium, with bacon, potatoes and toast. After picking up phone order and returning home to enjoy what was supposed to be a delicious breakfast, the eggs over medium was definitely not that, more like eggs over well done, also the toast and bacon seemed old. Needless to say our breakfast was not enjoyable as expected and couldn't even finish it.< /Review>

Fantastic lunch! Best taco salad I've had in my entire life. It's really stupendous. I had it with tortilla chips on the bottom instead of the big fried flour tortilla. My partner's plate is the seafood omelette, his favorite.<//Review>

Came in to have breakfast with my sister and I loved it. Our server Rosalba was amazing she was quick with our drinks and repeated our order, and when she brought it our she made sure we had everything we needed. The food was amazing!! I had the steak skillet, my sis had the green chile, and my niece had the eggs and sausage. Everything was cooked perfectly,  and the biscuits and gravy are a must have!! I will for sure be coming back to try the big burger my sister kept talking about. Rosalba made our visit very comfortable.</Review>

The drive-thru can be a little bit difficult to get into, but it's so worth it. We picked up our food and the staff was really nice, and the food was delicious. The fries alone were enough to get me to come back- super crunchy and fluffy, the perfect fry. And the rest of our food was very flavorful and freshly made. We'll be coming back.</review>

<text>Food & service was good.  Our group was here for a late breakfast.  Stick with American favorites.  I got the machaca breakfast which was ok but I get machaca  burritos down the street from me that are much more flavorable.

<Review>Excellent service in our visit during lunch hour. We recommend it. Our server was very attentive, and she never judged us despite the dirty and dusty way our clothing looked because of our job we were doing in San Jacinto that day. I wish I could remember her name to write it on this review.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Food was great, friendly & efficient staff. Wish their patio was set up so we could sit outside with our dog. Had to leave him in the car & run out every 10 min to check on him. Otherwise would hv been 5 star rating.<//Text>< pics>

We come here every Sunday. After 4 pm the kids eat free with a paying adult. With 3 kids that helps a lot. The service is awesome. The waitresses are always happy and smiling. The food is great. Their happy hour is from 3-6 pm with a 32 oz beer for $6.00.< /review>

<review>Wonderful! I love going here, the food is always amazing. I've had several different dishes at this restaurant and I think it's the best place in town.

I will warn that the Chicken & Waffles dish was supposed to be on the breakfast page instead of the dinner page, so it doesn't come with a soup/salad. But the server said she would get me a salad anyway, but because I'm her favorite person lol. (Don't do this on purpose, or you'll enforce that dish to be moved to the breakfast page!)

I really like how nice the servers are. Especially Natasha (I think I'm spelling her name right), she is so sweet and calls me her favorite person. 😄< /review>< name>

< Review>
I came across this place in another search engine about a year ago and went to try it out but, unfortunately, the outside facade left much to be desired and I ended up passing on it. Then it came up again just recently and with lots of good reviews so I decided to give it a try, again. It’s just a small local diner with really friendly wait staff and great cooks. I ordered the Country Fried Steak plate and it was one of the best I’ve had: the steak was good and gravy delicious; the house potatoes were moist and came with onions and peppers (if you desire); and the soft scrambled eggs I ordered were just as I asked- fluffy and yellow with no burnt parts.  I didn’t give 5 stars because the curbside appeal leaves much to be desired. A few little colorfully painted signs on the windows might go far to make this place more inviting and bring in more clients. Don’t let your first impression fool you. Go in.</Review>

Nice little place for dinner. Initially thought they were closed, it seemed dark and there weren't any lighted signs that I noticed. But we've driven by a few times and I've been wanting to try it out, so we pulled into the parking lot saw the open sign and an elderly couple heading in the door and stopped in ourselves. Nice inside, staff was very friendly. Typical prices for many ood the usual things you'd see on any menu. Kids eat free from certain times, so our daughter got her meal free, which was nice also. The food was good, the atmosphere was pleasant and we were glad we double checked to see if they were in fact open. Love to support local when we can almost headed to a chain restaurant, happy we didn't.</Text>

This little family-run local spot is such a hidden gem! It doesn't look like much from the outside, in fact the surrounding area looks a little rundown. But when you go in to JJ's Diner, the inside is absolutely beautiful. It looks brand new. And the food is amazing. They have great sandwiches and burgers... But, their strawberry lemonade was absolutely the best I've ever had! It was so fresh, with just the right amount of tarte, and the right amount of sweet, with fresh strawberries in the glass. I couldn't have been happier!!<//Text>

< Review>
It was good enought to wanna go back. My with liked the fettuccine alfredo she got. I got huevos con chorizo with beans and hash browns. The beans needed flavor but the rest was good. My kids got from kids menu for free and they liked it too. Service was slow at first but got better....enough for me to leave a small tip. Anyways if you read this give it a try. Im definitely going back. Im a very picky eater and this place was good.< /Review>

I went there this morning and first off they took way too long to take out order, the drinks were not chilled appropriately, the waitress wasnt very friendly and the food tasted disgusting and was cold. After they served the food, they didnt bother coming by again to ask if everything was okay. And to top it off it was expensive. They also need better lighting in there.< /Text>

You'd never tell from the plain exterior but the interior has had some serious love and cash put into it. The service was steller and the diner style plates are spot on. Totally came in for brunch on a whim and I'll definitely be back for dinner soon. I know this sounds like a paid add but it's not. Lol
