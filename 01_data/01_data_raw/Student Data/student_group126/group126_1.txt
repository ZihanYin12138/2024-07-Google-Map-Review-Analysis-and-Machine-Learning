Dr. Guerra and her staff are so kind and caring. I had cancelled my appointment  in the summer when Covid was really bad and was so busy at work I forgot to reschedule, and was not responding to the messages left to reschedule due to being busy.  Dr. Guerra personally reached out by email that she has not seen me.  Dr. Guerra is an amazing doctor and truly cares about her patients.  Even after my surgery, she made sure to get me back to normal activity and will be forever grateful for the way she made me feel comfortable and taken care of.< /text>

This is my first time being there and really liked the service from the employees.  The Doctor there was very helpful and really took the time to explain things to me.  I’m definitely going to continue going there for my next check up.< /review>

Took my mom to her mammogram appointment, waited one hour before we were informed it would be another 30 min or so, we were patient and waited. Front office check in seemed a little stressed, was not a smooth check in or wait appt.</Review>

<text>The staff here is amazing, gentle and caring. Dr Hsu, Ann and Thao ushered me through the procedures I had to go through and they treated me like a person rather than just another patient. They explained everything they did, discussed my after care and generally were wonderful. Thao was my angel and so gentle and sweet. They made sure of my comfort all the way through. Incredible staff!<//text>< Time>

Returning back to Breastlink for my care since my original surgeon relocated.   I met with Dr Guerra.  This lady is amazing,  she explained everything. Listened to my concerns.  Addressed my concerns.  And took her time with me. So glad to be back in good hands!   Highly recommend Dr Guerra and her staff was top notch.   Office ran on time,  friendly environment and I felt relieved after leaving knowing I was in the best of hands.<//Review>

Dr Guerra was very kind, thorough and took the time to explain everything in detail. She treated me like a family member rather than just another patient. She made me feel very comfortable in her examination and the entire office was very efficient providing a seamless experience. She gave me an opportunity to reach back out to her any time I should have questions in the future. I would recommend her to anyone needing a breast exam or second opinion.</Text>

I gave her my 2 insurances and she was asking me to pay cash telling me they were expired
Not such thing they are absolutely valid and it took her 15 minutes to enter them in the system to find out they area valid
I was very distress already and that made it worse

<Review>The doctor was great and thorough. It took me a over a month to get my appointment because of issues with receiving my authorization. Susie of the Newport Beach office went over and beyond to help me get in today plus get my authorization. Whereas the Orange call center needs more customer service training, they made every call like pulling teeth. Susie made this extremely stressful situation better. If it was not for Susie's tenacity, I would still be in libo as to my health. I would give 5 STARS to SUSIE and NEWPORT BEACH OFFICE, Doctor and Staff.  The 4 stars is due to the call center in Orange.<//Review>< pics>

Amazing experience (well as amazing as a Mammogram can be)! The front desk staff was excellent and the technician that performed my mammogram was absolutely amazing. So friendly and personable, almost made a mammogram feel like lunch with a friend. 😂

Clean and easy access to sanitizer. Technician even sanitized the door handle for me on my way out.  I felt very safe in the midst of a pandemic at this facility.</review>

I feel very blessed with Breastlink! Dr. Link and Dr. Guerra have given me outstanding care through this now second journey with breast cancer. Both doctors are down-to-Earth, caring, and very professional. They offer both telemedicine and in-office visits according to the patient's needs. I'll be forever "linked" to this wonderful practice!</Review>

<text>I am a new patient. was required to get a CD of latest mamo /US from Mission Hospital to be delivered prior to my appt. . I asked at the time if they wanted my 10 years of mamos or art least my abnormal one with biopsy. I was told no. I was instructed to arrive at 12:10 for a 12:30 appt to fill out paperwork. I sat in waiting room with another woman for 20 minutes, then I waited another 10 until I was called. Paperwork could have been printed out and completed at home. Secretaries were quietly complaining about a supervisor which I found unprofessional. Both mamo and US techs were pleasant and efficient. Was not aware that Breastlink is not part of the Hoag system. There is another portal and therefore more steps for my doctor to get results.<//text>< pics>

This NEwport Beach office was very clean and had a nice technician and office staff.

However trying to get a mammogram and a bone density test on the same day and location takes over half an hour. And then when I drive to Santa Ana, they said that they don’t do 3D imaging. So I had to make another appt for another day at another location. This was not the first time this happened.</review>

I’ve been having mammograms during the past 40 years, and they have always been incredible painful.  The receptionist was cold and not happy to answer my questions—she looked overwhelmed.
Once I was called in, Wendy received me with so much kindness that my stress level disappeared.  I told her, “I gave birth without an aspirin and would rather do it again than go through another mammogram.   My breasts are extremely sensitive.”
Wendy said, “Don’t worry. I will take care of you.”  And she did. This was the most positive experience I’ve had in 40 years. I will bring flowers to Wendy because she made my day. Thank you💕. Thank you💕.Thank you💕.

I have been with Dr. Link now for 20 years.   He and his staff have always been great.  Dr. Link has always been very caring, a great listener, upfront and honest.  I now go to his Newport Beach office where staff is great and friendly.  Mammograms are fast and easy.</text>

They went out of their way to help me get the paperwork they needed from my doctor's office, which i forgot to bring, and were very patient with me. I was able to get the results of my mammogram the same day, which put my mind at ease.  I would definitely recommend Breastlink to any and all of my friends and family and plan on returning for my future mammograms.< /review>< Pictures>

I arrived for my mammogram 20 minutes early like they asked. But they didn't take me back to get it done until 35 minutes after my appointment time. This was only after I went to the front desk and asked if they forgot about me. They took me back within 5 minutes of the time I went to the front desk. Tech was not that friendly. And then I had to wait another 25 minutes to see the physician. So I was there over 2 hours for a simple mammogram and quick follow-up appointment.<//text>

<Review>Amazing first time experience. The moment I walked in I was greeted  with a friendly receptionist which eased my Berger’s. The waiting room was very comfortable and clean. I didn’t have to wait for my appointment. Once I completed my paperwork they called me in the back within two minutes.  The ultrasound tech was very kind. Once she was done, Dr. Chen came in after she reviewed my ultrasound results and took a further look. Dr. Chen was very sweet and personable. I highly recommended this facility.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Very unprofessional staff at this location. I was referred to this place after my Physican discovered a lump in my breast. I just recently lost me Aunt to breast cancer and was extremely worried. The Ultrasound Technician spent less than a minute with me and rushed me out of the room. All of the information on my final report was fraudulent and said I discovered a lump at home. This place is a malpractice lawsuit waiting to happen...< /Text>

The facility is cute and very clean. The dressing rooms are discreet and clean as well.
The personal at the reception is just like in most places. Not friendly just polite. One thing I did not like was that one of the receptionists called me to take my information and asked me very personal questions in regards my medical history aloud and in front of the other personnel and patients.
My 3-D Imaging Technician, a cute blonde lady was very Professional, friendly, understanding and caring. I can tell she us very experienced at what she does as she makes her patients feel comfortable during such a not pleasant for many women procedure.   Other than the not good experience at the reception area I would definitely recommend this facility and its Technicians.< /review>

<text>Breastlink has the most amazing and thorough doctors. They don’t rush, they listen and are just wonderful!  I have been seeing Multiple doctors here since my breast cancer diagnosis two years ago and have referred them to friends and acquaintances many times. This is the best place to go for your yearly mammograms if you want to be sure they are looked at very very carefully.<//text><date>1540490557632<//date>< Response>

The staff was very efficient, zero wait time. Dr. Chen is amazing! She is very patient, did not rush through the procedure, made sure to answer all my questions even though I was extremely nervous and made me feel not stressed in a very stressful environment. I highly recommend Dr. Chen and her kind staff!! Five stars, indeed.<//Review>

My experience with Breastlink has been wonderful. I've never had issues with appointments and I have visited both the Newport Beach and Orange offices. Dr. Guerra is not only a skilled surgeon, but was caring and supportive as I went through my treatment plan. Dr. Justin West was also great as I went through my reconstruction.</text>

<review>The staff was friendly and helpful.  The wait was not too long.  I was given very explicit instructions concerning the procedure along with the preparations for it.  I was made to feel at home, so that I did not feel at all nervous.   Everything was done in an orderly and organized fashion.  It seemed that I was in and out of there in no time.  Overall this was a positive experience.< /review>< Time>

This was the worst mammogram I have ever had.

The tech jammed the machine against my rib bones and it was extremely painful to the point where I could not breathe. I understand they have to compress the breast and it gets uncomfortable but this was far beyond that, it was excruciating. As I sit here writing this review I am still in pain!

Then she gets an attitude even though I was placing my body exactly in all the twisted positions she was putting me in and did not move, I couldn't move even if I wanted to! And then she gets an image that she says my hand was in the way - but she was the one that placed my hand there and I did not move it! So she said she had to do it all over again. And that was the first breast.

The second breast she rushed through it to just get me out. She says she got the proper images but I'm not sure if she really did. I will find out if the doctor tells me to repeat it. But I will be sure to go elsewhere.

Also the waiting time was 45 minutes past my appt time. Awful experience!</text>

What an amazing team of doctors/specialists, team players, office staff and front desk staff!   I have been a patient here for years between the Laguna Niguel And Newport Ofices and each time I am here I have a fantastic visit, and I always receive the very best breast diagnostic technology and high quality medical breast screening. With a Dense Breast, and calcifications and difficult tissue to view, on my breast, this group gets it, they do the latest 3D Tomo Tech with screening and ultrasound. You know you are getting the best early defection. My experience at Breastlink is literally life saving care!!! I like how professionally diligent Dr. Chen, Wendy, and Judy are - they are very detailed oriented and with Breast Tissue that makes all the difference!!! AND, The girls upfront -  Lisa, Lacy and Shanna are like family, they get busy schedules, emotions with a lump on the breast and they care about you!   They make it a very beautiful and positive experience even with busy changing schedules!  Highly recommend this group for Top notch Womens Health and helping to Women Succeed!</Text>

This was the worst mammogram I have ever had.

The tech jammed the machine against my rib bones and it was extremely painful to the point where I could not breathe. I understand they have to compress the breast and it gets uncomfortable but this was far beyond that, it was excruciating. As I sit here writing this review I am still in pain!

Then she gets an attitude even though I was placing my body exactly in all the twisted positions she was putting me in and did not move, I couldn't move even if I wanted to! And then she gets an image that she says my hand was in the way - but she was the one that placed my hand there and I did not move it! So she said she had to do it all over again. And that was the first breast.

The second breast she rushed through it to just get me out. She says she got the proper images but I'm not sure if she really did. I will find out if the doctor tells me to repeat it. But I will be sure to go elsewhere.

Also the waiting time was 45 minutes past my appt time. Awful experience!<//Text>

Dr. Link told me I was cured after my mastectomy.  He told me I never had to see an oncologist ever again.  Thankfully, I didn't listen.  I am now terminal, Stage IV.  I would give him zero stars if I could.< /review>

What an amazing team of doctors/specialists, team players, office staff and front desk staff!   I have been a patient here for years between the Laguna Niguel And Newport Ofices and each time I am here I have a fantastic visit, and I always receive the very best breast diagnostic technology and high quality medical breast screening. With a Dense Breast, and calcifications and difficult tissue to view, on my breast, this group gets it, they do the latest 3D Tomo Tech with screening and ultrasound. You know you are getting the best early defection. My experience at Breastlink is literally life saving care!!! I like how professionally diligent Dr. Chen, Wendy, and Judy are - they are very detailed oriented and with Breast Tissue that makes all the difference!!! AND, The girls upfront -  Lisa, Lacy and Shanna are like family, they get busy schedules, emotions with a lump on the breast and they care about you!   They make it a very beautiful and positive experience even with busy changing schedules!  Highly recommend this group for Top notch Womens Health and helping to Women Succeed!</Text>

<Text>Worst place to just get an ultrasound ! First off the ultrasound technician was very rude to me for no reason. I kept explaining to them I wasn't there to see a doctor I already had one I had just been sent here for an ultrasound and kept asking why I had come here for when I already had an ultrasound somewhere else !!! I had to explain myself more than 4 times to the ultrasound technician and the "doctor".< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Stopped by for a drink while waiting for a nearby restaurant and so glad we did. They offered us a table u til our table was ready and had the check ready to go in case we had to leave in a hurry. Even able to take a few to go since the restaurant we were waiting for did not have alcohol. Great way to have mimosas and greyhounds with brunch when the place your eating at doesn’t serve it. Service was really great and drinks were on point. Glad we stopped by.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><text>My friends and I have become regulars. We love this restaurant/bar. The food is amazing, their pozole is delicious, the fish tacos, the fish and chips. The only thing I would suggest is an improvement on their french fries. They are too thin and small. I prefer them larger and thicker.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This place even on st Patty's day the worst service I've iver seen in a long time I was at the bar for 30 min and the bar tender told me I been there for 2 min probly case she was takeing shots in the back and I talk to the manager and told him the situation and I have never heard a manager what do you want me to to I was shocked I will never come to this place ever again and on top of it all the staff were drinking i think the staff were to busy helping there friends and not helping customers.< /Review>

<Text>Amazing. We happened to try it by chance, but, The food was outrageous and they have quite a few choice craft brews. I stuck with good old racer 5. The fish and chips is apparently award winning and for good reason. Also, had a burger to split and was highly impressed. We'll definitely be returning for the environment and the grub.</Text>< Pics>

The service is fair but good food. Obviously the cooks are immigrant workers from south america who did an excellent job cooking and served by americans to Americans. What an irony.</text>

<Text>Not a bad place... good music at the weekend... it gets packed so get there early for a table.
Good selection of beers and cocktails.
Only sampled the food but it was pretty good.
The door staff were a little prison guard like for me .. that's the face of the business,  they should try to be more welcoming.. but oh well... it takes only a second,  then you are in to enjoy your night.
I'd certainly go back,  great bar staff, and great table staff.<//Text>< Date>

<Text>So awhile back my wife found out about this place from a friend of hers and was going every Tuesday. I wanted to know what all the hype of Taco Tuesday was all about so I joined one Tuesday and I am so happy I did. Great Tacos for $1 each and $3 Dollar Beer Shots and Margaritas!</Text>< Pictures>

Their fish and chips are pretty amazing, and their breakfast burritos on the weekends are some of the best I've ever had. It's a great place to party especially for taco Tuesday and the weekends when the DJ is in.< /Text>

This pub is really just ok, been here several times. The bartenders are great. There is this unpleasant smell, I thought maybe the owner would have done something about it. Happy Hours is ok and expensive compared to other places that have Happy Hours. I will not be going back.< /text>

Good service, generous bar, small with a combination of booths and small bar tables with tall chairs or stools.  Menu is on the small side with some similar food options. Would visit again but not my first choice.<//Review>

If you don’t want to read this whole thing just know that London Gastropub is the worst place ever.  The story that follows is just to provide validity to my claim.  And for the record I am a Monrovia resident who loves most of the bars on Myrtle.

I came here with my cousin who had just gotten back from his 3rd Afghanistan tour.  We were looking for a fun night to blow off steam.

I had a Stella (a beer I’ve had hundreds of times which tasted weird, probably because of the black specs in the glass) and my cousin had a gin and tonic.  The gin and tonic was DISGUSTING.  I cannot emphasize that enough.  It was undrinkable.  He sent it back.  We watched as the waiter took the “undrinkable” drink and poured it over new ice and sent it back out.  We refused it and said we wouldn’t pay for it.  That’s when the bartender came over to talk and told us he was the owner.

(Just for the record: when a customer sends a drink back because it is DISGUSTING you should make a new drink.  Not pout it over new ice and send it back without even trying it)

I explained that our experience had been bad and we were going to leave.  He said we couldn’t leave until we paid for the drink.  (We had already paid for my Stella but wouldn’t pay for the gin and tonic).  The guy threatened to call the cops and told us we were not welcome back.

Worst experience ever.<//text>

We had an excellent dining experience at London Gastro Pub prior to going to movie (directly across street). The Cheeseburger and Tacos were delicious. Service was superb. Very nice ambience with good background music at perfect volume (not too loud like some places). I highly recommend trying this pub!<//Text>

I love this place. Their tacos on Tuesdays are outta control. They're prices are extremely fair and the food is yummy. If you have a four-legged family member, you can grab a spot on their patio and eat with them and they'll even bring a bowl of water out for them too!<//Text>

<Review>Service ALWAYS lags here. Not sure if it's lack of servers or just workers in general. And, it's hit or miss with good servers/bartenders... Mostly miss when I have gone.
I do enjoy their $1 taco Tuesdays and $3 beers.... Other than that, I guess you get the service that goes with the price.<//Review><Rate>3< /Rate>< date>

I was brought here by a regular attendee who thinks this is the best bar to go to especially on Taco Tuesdays where there's taco & drink specials, but note it gets really full that day. Parking can be found in the back.</review></record></dataset><record>
<text>I went here for taco Tuesday. They raised the prices here recently because it used to be $1 tacos and $3 margaritas, I think. Now it's $2 tacos and $5 margaritas. The tacos are not the best, though there is some variety but I feel that $1 is a better price for the quality. The margaritas we're also not the best and even the strawberry one just tasted like tequila and they were saltier than other margaritas I've had. It sounds pretty cheap but the bill stacks up faster than you realize. No problems with the service though. It was pretty good and the waitress checked up on us frequently.<//text><rate>3</rate>< time>

Nothing in here is British. They have pozole and tacos on the menu. Idk if this is intentional but it's confusing AF. The bartender was nice but was on his phone with his back turned to us. Once we ordered our drinks it was cool. We tried the bacon wrapped dates and they were unique at best buy I probably won't try then again. I will return because of the beer selection and we like downtown Monrovia.</text>

We have been to many of the bars and restaurants on Myrtle Ave and unfortunately London is one of our least favorites, both of the times that we visited, we had hoped to order a certain ale that they had on tap, the waitress took our order and came back to inform us that they had just ran out of the two that we had ordered, we were fine with that and made a second choice. My beer was brought a few minutes later but she informed my fiancé that they no longer had the second one he ordered. He ended up just trying a random choice and was not pleased. We won't be visiting London for a while, if at all.<//Text>

We stopped in Monrovia on our way home from Irwindale. I was thinking about either T. Phillips or Basin 141, but this place happened to have hockey on as we were walking, so we stopped here instead. The service was really good. You could tell the place is popular, but not so trendy you had to wait for a place to sit on a Saturday night. Had a great ceviche appetizer. I think that's just a Cinco de Mayo menu option, though. Pretty big portions. Very reasonably priced. Would definitely come back!< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Been going there for their fish for about 5 years. Last night the waitress told us that they had changed their menu......Well....They changed the food also. The portion and what was served with it had shrunk!
I used to travel over 2 communities to get there. I will not be going again. The waitress was pleasant and the service was good. I will miss this place. I guess they don't make enough off the booze to have
good food anymore. BYE OLD FRIEND!<//Text>< pictures>

Good food, $2.00 tacos on Tuesday. Small restaurant with limited seating that fills up quickly. There is limited parking to front but a large free parking lot to the rear.</review>

When we got there and asked about the menu, they knew that it hadn't been updated online in a long time.  Food and drinks were good, but there are definitely better options.</text>< pics>

<Text>Good food and drinks...But here's the thing. The menu they post on their website looks phenomenal...And we drove there expecting to have a menu somewhat similar...way off...
We asked the server if perhaps there was another bar menu and she explained how outdated the online menu was. Which can often be expected except, the menu they currently have doesn't light a candle to the menu posted. Kinda felt like it's probably not being updated for a reason. The online menu is defiantly worth the drive. The menu in house was totally not.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Look, this is an okay place.  It doesn't creep me out and folks are generally OK with outsiders being there.  No, you're not going to feel welcome after just one visit.  Over time we'll see.  Very much a locals only place.</review>

For more insight, Tuesday night's happy hour is really something if you're a taco lover. They have numerous meats to choose from and they're only a buck apiece. The drink special is margaritas. So if you're feeling like tacos and margaritas try this place on Tuesday night's.</review><username>Joe Stone</username>< GmapID>

I’m raising my opinion on The London.  4.5 Stars!

Service has always been good and definitely a 5 star rating.  The place is always busy, especially during sporting events. Of which why have like six screens covering everything.

I've tried the whole menu and can say it's getting better. Jalapeño Burger 4.25, Mullitas 4 Stars, Chicken Sandwich 4.5 Stars, tater tots Awesome!!, garlic fries and now Breakfast!!!

The breakfast sandwich is great and they do it right. We even had the breakfast tacos.

I should mention they seem to make their own sauces. Most of them are great and the spicy one that comes with the mullitas is ridiculous. Ask for this if you want the turn up the heat.

I would suggest you park in the back and sneak in the alley entrance. Especially on busy nights.

My only suggestion to the owner, on busy nights keep an eye on the fried items. That is the one thing that swings in quality noticeably.

Bring your family and friends. I'm coming back.</Review>

<Review>Service has always been friendly but a bit slow. It's still a pretty new business so I can forgive the small amount of food items on the menu. Def a good place to grab a few drinks, but the food is pretty expensive and not that great.< /Review>< Pics>

We had a great time here the other night! I was very impressed with their martinis, Dirty Martinis that is. I scower LA for the best Dirty's and I may have found it. Next step is getting them to carry my favorite olive juice (3BAR) and I'll be there every night.<//text>

This review is for the Taco Tuesday special. The other times I've been here the menu and food are just alright. On Tuesday's, the London has a special taco menu, I think they are all $1-2 and there are a good amount of choices.</review>

<Text>The food was bland. The wait was not worth it. They get two stars instead of one because at least the beer and service was somewhat decent. Wouldn't recommend this spot.< /Text>< user_id>

She too had a very negative attitude but reluctantly took it off. With food and 5 drinks it came to about 100 dollars so I would have tiped 20% but gave no tip. We have lived in monrovia for 60 years and have never seen such an unprofessional attitude.

I ordered fish and chips and it was factory prepared fish. Soggy and tasteless. Taste like frozen dinner from a box. The beer was okay. I can't remember ever writing a negative thing about a place. But this site asked me because of location is next door to Merengue, where I ate two nights ago..now that's a religious experience! R U kidding? Cuban Potato Balls, Empanadas and a cold beer after Christmas Shopping!!! Awesummmm!!</text>

Really long wait (on taco tuesday) and the service wasn't terrible, but wasn't the best, either. Pretty decent tacos, strong margaritas, but not the best tasting.</Text>

<review>I always love discovering new places. Especially pubs. I've been to alot, so I have a pretty high standard.

First: this is a self-proclaimed gastropub. I am not 100% sure what food qualifies them to be a novelty. I've had the fish n chips. Yummy. I've had their blue cheese burger. Super yummy. I've seen their fish tacos....meh. Prices are very reasonable, but I am not seeing a signature dish.

Their beer list is decent, they actually serve Boddington's and Old Speckled Hen, which is pretty impressive. These are great draft beers.

The service for me is conflicting. They are very nice yet they are slow as molasses. A lot of business people come in for lunch, so you should time yourself to an hour. It takes too long to get your check, your refill, your order in...

This business has a lot of promise but their staff needs to step up and create that awesome experience. They also need to make good on their gastropub promise. The way I see it, it's just a nice pub.< /review><Rating>3</Rating><GmapID>0x80c2d969f4ea9b97:0x9f7ea346c9e27df6< /GmapID><pics>None<//pics><user>116534936135389243233<//user><resp>None< /resp>< date>

<Text>I really like shopping here at Lids. Unfortunately they didn't have exactly what I was looking for this time. Different stores have carried what team I was looking for. I don't fault this location for not having the team I was looking for since it's a College team from a different state.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Pretty much the only legit hat store out there. They will get you set up. Look for specials as they tend to be a bit pricey.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><rating>4</rating><response>None< /response><user_id>111725973757517149532< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Supposedly for selling hats they don't have much of a variety they can't order you nothing special the guys there are knowledgeable but can't do much more than that<//review>

Taylor & Michelle are the best! I’ve been working with Taylor for about a year now and my life has drastically changed for the better. I was consistently getting sick bi weekly and having multiple other pains and aches post-surgery and post-college athletics that have all subsided for the most part and I only got sick one time in the last year! On top of that they’re both fantastic people and the office is a pleasure to be in. 10/10 recommend.< /Text>

< review>
I visted this Chiro office to claim a neck pillow offer, for full disclosure to the Google community.

While I waited for my appt time, it was quiet, cool, and relaxing. When I met Dr. Michelle she had a really calm and friendly vibe, something I look for in people for my healthcare team. Dr. Michele was articulate and gave instructions well.

If I was in the market for a Chiropractor I would definitely give them a shot.

Google maps is a little off on the directions, but had me within walking distance. This business is in a house that has been converted to a business.</review>

< Review>
Let’s start with first impressions. My first impression upon entering the waiting area was how clean and well kept it was. The decor is light and airy and very inviting. I was greeted my Michelle, the Mama Bear of the practice, she was friendly and pleasant.
She took me back to the exam room (which was also immaculate) and told me a little about herself, her husband how their practice came to be, then went over some stuff for their free neck pillow promo they had going on. We moved to her office and chatted a bit more about the care they offer. I made an appointment to return for a free consultation and will be going back in a few days.
There was sales gimmick, no pushy attitude trying to force me to become a patient, just pleasantry all the way around.
So while my experience has yet to be for physical care, my experience has been great so far.
I can tell that they are the kind of people you return to for your needs for years on end, kind of like a dentist, when you find the right one you keep them, you refer family and friends to them, etc.
About the pillow, this thing is amazing and I’ve only had it for a few hours!! I took it to work and used it to support my back all day. I can’t wait to sleep on it tonight!!
Pascal Chiropractic has my approval, I’d recommend them to friends and family!<//Review>

I give em a 6! This husband and wife duo have been providing chiropractic care for well over a year now and my body has never felt better. Dr. Taylor caters to me needs by asking at the beginning of each visit how the body is feeling and any specific areas I wish to focus on.

They are both wildly knowledgeable about their field and are happy too go as deep or keep it as high level as you’d like. I also appreciate the passion they have for their profession.<//Text>

I picked up their pillow a week ago, and was surprised by its size.  Since having it, I’ve used it every night when initially going to bed.  It fits snugly and comfortably helping to relieve the stress in my shoulders and neck which allows me to fall asleep faster.  I actually slept on it a full night, but since I am a side sleeper it was a bit of a challenge to maintain contact and comfort.  Upon visiting the office, there was a very friendly and inviting atmosphere.  Thanks to Dr Michelle for the time she took and the information she provided.  Very good experience.</Text>

I received a free neck pillow and have been using it for a week.  It beats all the other types of pillows I already own (contour memory foam, buckwheat pillow and several others).  I would definitely come back again and recommend to others.<//text>< pics>

It has been almost been a month since I’ve used my neck pillow and I must admit my sleep has been a bit better. I met with Dr. Michelle Pascal and she was very sweet. She was informative and asked me some questions so she could get to know me.

The office is located right next to Walgreens and is in a nice area. It is also clean and welcoming.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I am no stranger to chiropractic, I have been a chiropractic patient fairly regular for 40 years!! Got results too! This time is different, Dr Taylor treats the whole body inside and out!! I have had high blood pressure for 15 years, really no reason! Several months after I started seeing Dr.Taylor I noticed my blood presser was way low. I ask him about it and found out that the blood circulates through the upper cervical which he had been adjusting! Now that it is no longer being pinched and the blood is flowing better I have cut my blood pressure medication in half!!! Oh I can turn my head without my neck screaming help every time as well!!! Don't get me wrong he adjusts my whole body and  also working on nutrition! They didn't ask for a book so go and find out for your-self!!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Dr. Taylor had been treating my neck and back for the last 5 visits.  In the beginning, I thought it was slow in process but after 3rd visits, my body is healing well with less neck pain, less stress, and more flexibility in the lower back, that had been going on for years. I also like his personality, very precise but not too overwhelming, so I can easily open my symptoms to him. Thank you Dr. Taylor!</Text><rate>5</rate><name>Alice Kang</name>< GmapID>

I had a good conversation with Dr. Michelle regarding her practice and the neck pillow. We touched on how screen time is affecting kids’ spines and how through their practice they have been able to improve and impact others’ lives. I used the pillow driving and it did help support my neck. It is soft and cozy. I have also used it to support the spine by putting it between my knees if I’m side sleeping. The kids can also use it to support their necks during screen time. Their home office is very clean, relaxing, and serene. She says she doesn’t do cracking so may return after some time to try it.< /text>

They had a free pillow giveaway going so went in for that. Dr. Taylor said it was their way of giving back to the community. Location & parking were easy to find. Office was neat and clean. Will consider them if I'm in need of chiropractic services.<//text>

Both Doctors are extremely nice, patient, and helpful.
I think giving away pillows is a very smart marketing plan. I would definitely come back if/when i need a chiropractor.

I was given clear instructions on how to use the neck pillow to address my individual neck concerns.  I've been using it the past 4 nights, and while at first I thought it would be weird adjusting my pillow whilst I sleep,  I have been doing it while sleeping and am definitely finding that in the morning I have less of the neck stiffness I had been experiencing with my regular pillow.  My son also likes to take it and use it.< /text><Time>1556465063623<//Time>< name>

My husband, who also is seen by Dr. Taylor, no longer suffers from constant migraines. Dr. Michelle Pascal sees both of my kids. She is an essential asset to helping them grow to their fullest potential during their pre tween years.

Came in for a free neck pillow. Dr. Taylor was super nice and knowledgeable. Just explained how to use it. No hard pressure sales tactics. Will definitely be keeping him on my list when I need a chiropractor.</Text>

Dr. Pascal was really nice and informative. The chiropractic pillow works great for my back when I'm sitting and when when I'm laying on my side, it does support my neck. However, when I lay on my back, it does hurt my neck after awhile of laying on it<//review>

I suffer from headaches and neck pain, so when I saw that Pascal Chiropractic was giving out neck pillows, I had to jump at the opportunity. When I arrived to the office, the waiting room was really nice and peaceful. I met with Dr. Michelle Pascal and she showed me how to use the neck pillow and the benefits it would have while I’m sleeping or sitting at my desk. After using the pillow for a few days, I noticed a huge difference! My neck wasn’t aching and my lower back didn’t feel so stiff while working on my computer. Dr. Michelle Pascal was very friendly and professional, she made sure to answer all of my questions and concerns. I would definitely recommend stopping by and seeing how Dr. Michelle and Taylor Pascal can help you live a pain free life.< /review>

I haven't been to them for Chiropractic services, but Dr. Pascal was very friendly. I went in to pick up a free pillow they were giving away, she was knowledgeable and kind and also said if this pillow didnt work they had other options I could try. I do not need to try any other pillows this pillow is GREAT!!! Since I picked it up I haven't used any of my other pillows, I wish I had 10 of these so I could have one everywhere. Since using the pillow my neck doesn't hurt during the might or in the morning when I wake up. I would highly recommend this pillow to anyone whether u are a side or back sleeper (I'm both).< /review>

I visited Pascal Chiropractic as a result of a Facebook campaign promoting neck pillows. So far, I really enjoy it, and I appreciate that Doctor Michelle took time to ask about my neck pain and explain how chiropractic work.< /review>

Their office is really nice and Dr. Taylor is very knowledgeable! Both him and Michelle were very welcoming and warm upon meeting them. Dr. Taylor gave me lots of good advice on how to use his chiropractic neck pillow for my bad neck and lower back, and helped me out with posturing and positioning it (I went home and immediately used it hahaha). Dr. Taylor was also kind enough to offer me some water on my way out as it was very hot outside!

Kissed my neck troubles goodbye after a while of using this pillow! Lower back issues have also almost gone away (I can only blame myself for that, cuz of inconsistency)</Text>

I’m using the pillow to support my neck while sleeping on my side and I also used it on my flight to Hawaii.

<Text>It saddens me to do this review. I got this hair premium curly years ago I loved it but because of financial issues beyond my control I have not been able to rebuy. Halloween 2020 they had a big 50% off sale. So i jumped on the premium Malaysian Straight 24' 22' 20' and was super excited. Today I got it installed with expectations of being FABULOUS for my birthday hair do BUT the hair is SUPER thin on the end. 😪😪
When i purchased the hair years ago it was full from the track all the way down and GORGEOUS Times sure have changed and so has their hair.I can say the customer service is superb as I remember but I will not buy again. I am so sad. Regretfully I waited all this time for bundles that turned out at the end of the day TOO THIN TO WIN
I am on a hope and a prayer it doesnt shed like something terrible</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Stay away from the studio bundles! I ordered a 20in and one received I knew immediately I would regret installing it. The ends were so scraggly that by the time I got done trimming them it was a 18in bundle. The curl pattern was almost non existent And the MATTING! This is some legit ali express mess. Their regular bundles are really good though, and standard shipping is pretty quick. hence the 3 stars.< /Text>

I love this hair I've bought it twice and each time it's been awesome. The Brazilian body wave is super thick and curls very well. It does not shed its just all around a good buy. The prices are affordable and they always have great bundle deals. If you are looking to purchase some hair this is the place to do it. I've have gone to the store in Los Angeles to buy the hair. Each time the employees are super nice and helpful. They let you touch the hair and take out as many bundles you want to see. Just all around a great product to buy</Text>

<Text>I love, love, love this hair. It's been the only hair I've used in years. In all my hair pics it's the only hair I've been rocking with, I have bundles that are 2-3 yrs old now. They have been dyed and bleached multiple times also. The curl just comes right back and the texture is the same as if it just had its first wash. I recommend this hair all the time, all my friends are wearing it because of me. Keep up the good work and it is worth every penny rather on sale or not.</Text>< pics>

I started off with a simple 16in Brazilian Body wave and as soon as I got it I dyed it to a honey blonde color I received so many compliments. Then I went back again and got a 18in. Dyed it the same color! Got the same perfect A++++ rating quality. My last purchase was 2015 I went way longer and got a 22in Brazilian Deep Wave with an amazing B2G1 bundle deal. This time I bleached it and did many different colors from red to orange and now back to black. You can never go wrong with bundle deals for top notch hair. The bundles are thick and full which I love. Her Imports is my #1 got to/ right hand for amazing hair. If you want compliments on your hair 25/8 get you some Her Imports.</review>< Pictures>

<UserId.>111009924257674685452<//UserId.><Name>Sunset Ravenell< /Name><review>I absolutely love Her Imports. I took a chance on this hair after hearing several commercials and guess what, I'm SOLD. I have told both of my co-workers about this hair and they are now customers as well. I love the fact that if 'wears' well. It does not shed, it's soft, easy to curl and pin curl. I bought some bundles when I first started using this hair over a year ago and I  still using them and the hair feels just as good as the first time I had it installed. So if you are looking to "Upgrade" your hair extensions, Her Imports is the way to go.

Sorry trying to upload pic but it's not working. But believe me this hair is AMAZING 💁🏾</review>< time>

Great Service. I drove to the LA location to get my bundles very last minute. I got lost and frustrated so I drove home. On my way I called and a gentleman answer and gave me directions. When coming back the next day I knew exactly where it's was at. So happy because I has a hour to grab my hair and get to appointment. When entering the location I was greet by a young lady. She was very nice and helpful. Helping me pick out the lengths and recommending the perfect hair to straighten and curl. I absolutely loved that I was able to feel the hair. Best place to get hair so far. I have now had the hair for 6months and dyed it 3 times and I can say I am very happy. No shedding and freezing up.< /Review>

<Text>I absolutely LOVE Her Imports!!! Their customer service is amazing whether it’s inside the store or through the online store. I’ve been using her imports for a few years now and I constantly receive complements daily. Even when it time for a new install I still receive plenty of complements. After using her imports hair I have finally found a company where I don’t mind investing my money into their products. The hair is so great that I don’t have to buy new hair often although I do love when they have their amazing hair sales. If you’re thinking of trying her imports I say 100% go for it and it will be the best hair decision you ever made. Be sure to try the deep wave it’s my absolute favorite!!! </Text>< Time>

As someone who has been disappointed in hair companies time and time again,  I'd like to say that Her Imports has been the best and has been my go-to company since my first purchase. I first decided to try the company because of its story and mission to provide good quality hair for those like me who have been bamboozled by these online hair companies. There are always great deals so affordability is a plus.  I've been rocking the Brazilian Body Wave for about a year now. The Culver City staff was pleasant and very welcoming. I called before hand and when i got there I was greeted with exactly what I asked for over the phone. The street was kind of creepy dark but the building guard was attentive and escorted me upstairs with no problem.  I've ordered online before but I prefer the in-store purchase.  Overall,  I've had such a great experience and will definitely keep visiting the Culver City location.<//Text>

Great quality, great prices and promotions, if you're not wearing Her Imports, you're not wearing the best. What's even more amazing about this company is their work ethic and social presence. They clearly build a relationship with consumers on an intimate level -and that's how it should be. The quality of work speaks for itself, from their original illusion frontals, premium hair and even high quality makeup, Her Imports proves that a successful business can deliver great products without losing integrity. I look forward to doing more orders and I am proud to see this company grow!<//Text>< pics>

<Text>I've bought from her imports and I absolutely love it. At first I was skeptical but after talking to the manager I store and actually feeling and seeing the texture I was impressed. I bought four bundles of the Brazilian body wave and after my second install this hair is amazing. I've went through several hair companies and I've never found anyone as close as this. I will be a loyal customer as long as I'm wearing weaves.< /Text>< date>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>When it comes to good hair extensions, Her Imports is my go to. I'm very picky. I have tried it all! From cheaper companies whom sell ratty and matted hair to hair companies that claim that their hair is the best with a high clientele and once the hair is used once, the hair states otherwise. I finally came across Her Imports about a year and a half ago and I never went back! Their hair is unbeweaveable!!! Amazing to say the least. It doesn't mat, rarely sheds, and stays in immaculate condition after washes. I've bought from them twice already, mainly because I like to switch up my lengths or add more bundles to my wigs, and all of my bundles are still in great condition. I am a Latina who wears weaves and this hair is literally perfect for all ethnicities!! It blends so well with my hair giving me a natural and flawless look. I love Her Imports!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2b0ad46afef27:0xc266c30177a9e71e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had bought 3 bundles about two years ago of Brazilian hair. May I say that has been the best purchase of hair I've EVER brought! Can't wait till I can purchase from them again, & go to Vegas and get my install from Lashe'. She refers her clients to Her Imports and there is a reason why because they are truly amazing!</Text>

This hair is more than amazing. I've had super bad luck with "Virgin" hair but HerImports changed my whole perspective on weaves. This hair is so soft, lots of body, and movement. The curl pattern is flawless! I'd recommend them to anyone. I'm even considering going into business with them.<//text>

I purchased the Brazilian wavy and it's the best hair I have ever purchased!!! I get compliments everyday......it doesn't tangle or shed and it has a very natural look! This hair is perfect for women that are active, I teach Zumba and I usually sweat a lot and after an intense workout I have no problem combing through the hair!!! This hair is a keeper, I plan on wearing it for years to come!< /Review>

I've been shopping here since they were on Vermont Blvd in Los Angeles, never had a problem. They always offer great deals buy 2 get 1 free and the occasionals text messages for $100 off an order or $200 dollars or more. The hair does not ahead and the customer service is always great. They always answer the phone and are always prompt in informing me on inventory present and incoming inventory. As long as they're around I'll only purchase my Brazilian hair from them. Hair does not shed or tangle, I've only worn this hair, you can dye it multiple times and it's still soft silky and does not get stiff. I'm a lazy person some nights I don't tie my hair down but my hair is still like new after a good wash and blow dry. Love them<//Text>

<Review>The hair is really good hair and the store has a real professional setup and feel to it. It's like no other hair place I've ever seen.  I love when they had a special going on with the student discount with good report cards.  You got 30% off if you hAd a 3.0 gpa and 20% off if you had a 2.0 That was a really great deal can't wait to see that one come back. I love the Los Angeles store 👍👏</Review></record></dataset><record>

I first ordered my have in 2012 there was a bundle deal that caught my eye. I purchased the 3 bundles Brazilian at the time it was 16,18,20inches this hair has went from a 1B in color to now I have it as a blonde color it has no shedding and I'm on my 7th install. The only reason why I want to purchase more bundles is because I want to experience different hair besides Brazilian. The local store that I went to is in Los Angeles and wasn't far from my house. The service was great and I made the best purchase which ended up being more like an investment. I highly recommend this hair company Her Imports because I can truly say that quality is was prevailed in my situation. Thank you Her Imports for being professional and having the best quality!!!< /Text>

I purchased 3 bundles of the Mongolian tight curl last summer , bundles were very full & hair was delivered 3 days after ordering even though estimated delivery said 5-7 business days. Minimal shedding and I've installed it at least 5 times over the past 13 months . Bleached and colored after about 7 months . I was able to get hair  bone straight and back curly after wash and deep conditioning .< /Review>

<Text>Very nice location...its located in a corporate building which is private and a nice change from the store fronts. I was greeted immediately and received a knowledgeable  one on one consultation. I ended up purchasing some 24in brazilian bundles. Great quality, natural luster, no tangling, very minimal shedding. I also purchased their Osi works shampoo and Conditioner that works awesome on my bundles and natural hair as well!<//Text>< Pics>

I been through so many ups and downs trying to buy quality hair. I brought hair once from one company and I was looked in my face and I was told the hair would last me over a year I can say about 1 month later the hair sheded so much then it was really matted. That was a waste of money I did not have then a shared the same experience with two other companies. I gave up just a little with purchasing bundle hair. Then I googled and her hair imports came up in my search I looked at the web over and over until I got nerves to give it another try. I must say God is my witness this is quality hair the price a can never be to high because this is the first company that has looked at me and said the hair will last me a year and more and the hair has actually last over a year. I'm so happy because money don't grow on trees nobody wants to keep wasting money and being lied to. I recommend this company to anybody that wants quality hair that really hold its value and I pray God continue to bless this company.< /review>

<Text>I stop by her imports about a week before my birthday back in late November and I was super excited because I was getting my first sewn in weave. I met a Effin along with his assistant and they were amazing I ended up getting 3 bundles and a closure and getting the Peruvian deep wave love the hair still have it in. I also ended up contacting herimports told them how much I loved it was able to even get featured on their Instagram page and would love to get more hair it is so fabulous. I told my friends about it I'm just a total advocate for it now and would love to come back!!! It's great location in the heart of L.A, great customer service and the people are just amazing!!!! Thank you so much for treating me so well and having me hooked now!! xx</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Ive been to this location and i love it. I love the way the pictures on the wall of people wearing the extensions are posted so if you have a certain way of what texture you want they can just point at the picture and say well this person is wearing brazilian body wave. Henry is absolutely amazing. He was very detailed about all the textures and letting me know how they would blend in and that i can dye the hair basically do whatever with it just treat it like my own. The hair doesnt shed or tangle and im happy with that. I think this hair can last a long time if you take good care of it. I feel like people are getting paid to write bad reviews because this hair is the BEST!!! GET YOU SOME YOU WONT REGRET IT!!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>Online orders are shipped from this location and I recieved my online order in 2 days. It was package so neatly. I purchased 3 bundles 16,18,20 of the Peruvian body wave. The hair is very soft with minimal shedding. I have had this hair over a year and it still looks new. I have the herimports brand of flatirons as well and I love them. They leave your hair feeling silky and smooth. Quality hair is an investment and if your looking to invest your money in quality hair, luxury, long lasting hair then look no further. I highly recommend Herimports!!!! I have been a customer for over 5 years!!!<//text>< Pics>

I haven't had any of Her Imports hair but one of my best friends have multiple bundles and the hair has never failed😋. From the bounce of the hair, softness, and the shedding its amazing and I'm not sugar cotting. The hair takes color without a problem she went from blonde to brown and red to orange and the hair still holds its same texture as when she first got it. Yall selling the best hair yet so I want me some.😂</text>

As a woman who has been buying weave hair for numerous years i recommend all my co workers & family members to her imports Los Angeles store for all their hair needs. They carry good quality hair that never shed or tangles & they offer bundle deals well worth your money.The brazilian body wave is one of my favorites the bundles are thick & the curl pattern can flat iorn straight, or wash & come back to its original wave deff my go to store for hair .<//Text>

Been coming here for all my extensions and also bringing friends here... Love the professionalism and location. Great staff.... I get super excited when it's time to purchase new hair. The office setting makes you feel special. Being able to go in to a office by yourself and pick out the perfect batch of hair is great. For all the real hair lovers Her Imports in Culver City is the place. The office overlooks the 405 and culver city area.. and the cute little Latina with blonde hair is so sweet and patient because We all know picking hair is a proccess. Anyway i recommend this location if you in La on the Westside ... See y'all soon.< /Review>

<review>Her imports has the most amazing hair. My cousin Quan is a faithful customer. She colors her hair often but it still keeps it hold, shine and soft texture. My co-workers who are weave-ologist (having a degree in weave appreciation :-p) are always raving about her imports and their hair is also always glamorous and flowing. Me myself having a weave is a rarity but when I do I always ask those that know best. I'm taking engagement pictures and getting married soon...I know where I'm going!!!! P.S if it doesnt meet the standard they keep it allllll the way One Thousand! ♡♡♡♡<//review>< pictures>

I just randomly went to purchase hair this past weekend on Saturday after I've debated since forever on buying hair from Her Imports but i dragged my bestfriend with me for assistance come to find out I didnt even need her lol the guy was so helpful and friendly when it came time to helping  me pick out the right length and type that i felt best fit me. He was so patient as i was a little indecisive but i finally went with 1 18" and 2 20" bundles of Brazilian Body wave and I also caught the $100 off sale. I absolutely love my hair I've gotten so many compliments and now my coworkers call me RiYonce , this is the best hair out there I promise< /review>

I purchased 4 bundles of Brazilian deep wave
This hair is so thick it's amazing
A lot of companies hair gets thin towards ends
Or the hair quality will drop tremendously but I loved it through my first install after 1 month i tried to style it and the hair wouldn’t hold curls and it had this very unappealing thick dry look to it before i even added color.
I could only wear it in its natural
State . The hair seemed perfect at the beginning i actually was obsessed but it was a bad batch of hair . This hair has volume but it did go bad shortly after 1 month . I was raised in the hair business  my grandma passed her salon to my mother who passed it on to my aunt who currently owns it and i also have been wearing this texture of weave for a very long time so i know how to maintenance any type of hair. I contacted them via instagram just to inform them and I was blocked
Customer service was actually poor they were rude and hard to talk to when purchasing. I Arrived right before closing and the young lady walked down to open door. Quick to the point I even felt through a few bundles to pick the best ones in my eyes before purchasing . I liked the hair at the beginning so much that even though it went bad i still purchased another 3 bundles of straight and the same thing happened.  Couldn’t style it it had this thick coarse look after washing . I had two stylist style my hair and i just didn’t like it

I've been coming here for years! My best friend swears they have the best most interesting pizzas in the Inner Richmond. I think they are okay. I will say that they definitely have unique pizza topping combinations. The beer is good, nothing crazy. Very  drinkable and priced well. They have a cool fireplace in the back too. It can be kind of confusing when you walk in because there are two sides to the restaurant, the bar side and the restaurant side. I always walk in the bar side, do a double take and then go, "yep...I need to go in the other door." They accommodated a large party for a friends birthday at last minute too. Good for a chill meal with good friends!< /text>

This place is awesome. They have tons of TVs, so it's a great place to go to watch games. Right when you walk into the bar area there are two sections of couches, so it definitely has an eclectic ambiance (which I love). They brew their own beer and have DELICIOUS pizza (which can be a bit pricey, but Tuesdays it's half off!!) Don't bring your grandparents here (unless they can handle the raunchy drink names and Adam and Eve mural...)< /text>

< Review>
My friend and I just flew in and were looking forward to trying this place.  It was around 1 PM and the place was almost empty.  We ate at the bar and the bartender Annie was incredibly friendly.  She gave us plenty of advice on what pizza and beers to try, as well as other places to visit while in San Fran (including pizza and breweries).

The beer was fresh and well balanced.  They had about 12 beers on tap, and the peach pale ale was one of my favorites there.  There pizza selection was eclectic and unique.  I had a pizza with a refried bean sauce, chicken, fresh pearl tomatoes, on top of greens and cheese; really tasty.

Overall, Pizza Orgasmica was delicious and I would recommend it to those pizza enthusiasts who want to enjoy good beer with their pizza.</Review>

<review>One of the hardest parts of moving across town was moving away from Pizza Orgasmica. The decor and ambiance of this place is wonderfully San Francisco. Their beers are incredible for such a small shop. A great place for groups and parties. Check it out if you're ever in the neighborhood.</review><username>Jonathan Schoonhoven<//username><resp>None</resp>< userid>

My friends and I came here on a Sunday to watch the Niners game and enjoy some pizza and beer. Our waiter was super nice and attentive. He warned us that a big party was coming, so it would be good idea to order a pizza soon or else we would be waiting forever for it. We ordered the Orgasmica. The pizza was basically a combination pizza. Additionally, I tried many other pizzas when I was there because it happens that the other party was friends with my group. The portions were good for each of us and the crowd was good to watch games.</Text>

Came here for a social gathering and was surprised by the size of this place. It's huge. One side was loud and rowdy full of people hanging out and drinking, then there was this mellow low key side where I sat on the floor with a bunch of pillows eating and hanging out with my friends.

The pizza was fantastical too. I would highly recommend it. Pepperoni all day!< /review>

Love the Serpent's Kiss, always my go to pizza. Had my birthday there, great service. I had us sit in the floor lounge, where you sit cross legged. Unfortunately for us, we were right where the receptionist/take out stand was, and the phone would go on and on and on. They also only had a couple beer towers in commission when we were there so my friends weren't able to get chilled beer they could serve themselves with. I think it's great value. They're also somewhat inconsistent with givin out their loyalty magnets, we should be a bit more proactive about it though. I tend to go back a couple times a year.<//text>

The decor at this Pizza Orgasmica location is absolutely stunning. While you sit at the bar and enjoy a pizza or three, and a smashin' beer flight, look up. There's a beautiful stained-glass mosaic that will take your breath away.</Text>

<Review>So I really don't know what I think of this place.

So the pizzas are pretty good and it's 1/2 off pies on Tuesdays.  That makes it a great deal!  The beers here are okay too.

But every time I've dined here I've had a stomach ache the next day.  I think it might be the beers, but I really don't know.  Could be just me though, cuz my friends are usually fine.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I love the place!  but I just wanted to SCREAM when I saw two reviews where they talked about Romeo  and Juliet!  WHAT?????? that's  Adam and Eve!  I am not a Bible thumper,  but  I don't recall Romeo offering Juliet an apple.....  correct me if I am wrong!  all you yuppies need to get off your cell phones and start paying attention to the world around you!  Thanks for listening</review>

<review>For being a chain restaurant, I was really pleased with the pizza here. My boyfriend and I couldn't decide between 2 of the veggie pizzas so they did a half & half order for us without charging extra. The only problem with our meal here is that the service was really slow - there was no one at the door when we walked in so we stood around for a while and finally we decided to just take a seat ourselves. Then the server took a while, but overall pretty great place.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>Solid pizza! The place is a little cramped though. But if you're happy with a barstool and a small table then you're good. I get the "casual" theme and in theory it's probably fun to sit on the floor/couches... but c'mon they CAN'T be clean. Great pizza in a pub style joint.</text><user>104847770319584345133<//user><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

Given the choice, I would much prefer Dino's, Paxti's, or (gasp), even Round Table. The service is nothing remarkable, the beer selection is fine, and the prices are relatively reasonable. All of that in mind, they do serve a tasty Hawaiian, which tends to be my go to when visiting Orgasmica.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x8085873d99cc0635:0xfa5a9747dab26e09<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>
< review>
Good reliable pizza and beer. My friends and I frequent the FiDi location often, so when I heard I was moving near one, I knew what would be by top go-to places for a good pie. Their thin crust pizzas are good (I save the thick crust or deep dishes for Little Star or Patxi's). They have a nice bar and lots of TVs if you wanted to just have a low-key beer and catch the game, but I have been when its gotten really loud. Having lived here for a while now, I find this location a bit strange, beautifully decorated, but not matching any of the neighboring Asian places.</review>

It was terrible, had to go to a waiter to ask for the menu, it took 3 different servers to do 1 waiter's job: take our order, get our pizza, give us our water and beer. To make it worst the waiter forgot to place the order of the pizza.

The best part was the waiters were taking shots in front of the owner or manager (a white male a little bit on the heavy side) and customers. I can clearly see why the service was terrible.

The only good note was the pizza... but then again I was hungry after waiting for a long time for the food.</text>< pics>

<Review>Come here with friends on Tuesdays! Large pizzas are half off!

The best pizza here is the Brazilian chicken with buttercream sauce and broccoli. Ironically, the chicken they put on the pizza can be a little overcooked and dry, but the buttercream sauce and broccoli combo is amazing. Sometimes I order it without the chicken. I'm not sure what makes it "Brazilian," but it's definitely unique to Pizza Orgasmica.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Also, found how orgasmic this pizza was in 2007. I didn’t think it was that orgasmic. What’s good for some may not be as good for others. I didn’t try of their seductive sounding mixed drinks but I did appreciate that they had beer on tap.<//text></record>

Pizza Orgasmica is one of the better pizzas I've ever had, but this place suffers from a lack of consistency.

First, the positives: The pizzas here are some of the most delicious, fresh, inventive pizzas I've ever had.  Highlights include the Inspiration Point (pesto, red sauce, shredded chicken, spinach, more pesto) and the Kinky Cow (red sauce, shredded carrot, ground beef, bleu cheese).  Some of the taste combinations are unusual for pizza, but they really do work.  Unlike some pizza places which throw weird stuff onto a pie and call it gourmet without caring whether the combinations play well together or taste good, this place has a good chef behind the menu.  Trust their combinations and order liberally.

Wings are a sweet asian barbecue style sauce, not the more traditional "buffalo wings" you normally find at a pizza place, and quite delicious.  The salads are great, too.

Orgasmica brews their own beers, and while they aren't the most delicious brews I've ever had, they're solid, enjoyable, and reasonably priced.  Don't be shy about ordering them.  The peach ale smells like a basket of peaches and tastes about the same.

Here's the bad part: The inconsistency. Sometimes the pizzas are perfectly done; other times they're almost burnt and they sit under the heat lamps for too long. Sometimes they're well made, with the proper balance of ingredients; other times they aren't, and you get crab meat on your chicken pizza (true story).  Sometimes the service is great and friendly; other times it's crappy and the people are rude.  It's consistent inconsistency, and it's enough to deter me from going sometimes.

It's also expensive.  $30 for an extra-large pizza?  Jebus!  Go on Tuesday nights when they have 50% off L and XL pizzas.  It's a deal then.< /review>

Beers are good. Peach ale good. Golden good. Amber good. I like beer, I brew beer. and I like drinking theirs up because they know what they are doing hehe...

Ok, Pizza is good if you like the style, its that kinda chibata bread light crust like what you get from some trader joe's pizza .. it's good, it's not omg i am going to fall on the floor and faint good, but tasty enough to keep coming back. I haven't had take out, i don't know if this would fare well as a carry out item but its fine the next day if you have leftovers. thats a good mark for pizza, shelf life, lol..

I have been here twice. that's kind of a rule now with my yelping, places i hear of and have been to more than once, but anyway,

Decor here is awesome. you are thrown back in time with the wood carvings and stained glass and mural and what not. stay in THE BAR AREA, that's where it happens. the couches and stuff are fun victorian era stuff. i could totally see a vampiress swoop in and bite my neck, leaving beer and pizza stains in her wake..

where was i.. oh yeh, try to avoid the restaurant AREA unless you have a big group of people that wouldnt otherwise fit around the bar somehow..

the restaurant had a creepy vibe like a bad feng shui sort of way, but then i am dark and jaded so maybe i was just sensing me LOL .. so far we are at a few stars...

i traditionally tip 20% seriously, like, by habit.. yes i like pizza orgasmica. i love the beer. they do have special happy hours and themed times for all sorts of fun with lower prices on stuff, but other than that, if you go during a peak time when nothing special sort of deal is going on, then, well, pirces a bit high. i had a pizza and 3 beers and think it was like 40 bucks. is that bad? uh... well $15 in beer $25 pizza? its a weeeee bit high... for one person! mmm looks like 3 stars there...  living in the city is expensive, having a bar or restaurant is too. can they lower the price or up the pizza quality somehow? this i dont have mad skillz to know.

yes theres lots of cheap shite places you can go to in the area but who has themes and brews beer and pizza? not many... not many.. worth the extra coinage? yeh.. i left happy, there was a bunch of what i gather to be USF people there getting pretty drunk and they made me laugh. i was a bit tipsy after 3 pints so good thing i can walk home from there.. ha!

that said, let me say the bartenderess is freaking cool awesome fun person major love it. dig it. nice. makes for a happy place. and she's a bit curvy which i like in a person, no stick figure tall long leg aliens with giganormous boobs out to here for me, i likes em more natural. damn, off topic again.

of the place itself, i think they have free wifi also, which is a plus.. i am going to bring a laptop sometime, plunk down in a cozy sofa, blog away while drinking beer and eating pizza. how cool is that? Ernest Hemingway would approve of the ambiance i'd suppose..

Ah you know what, I am bumping this one up from 3 to 4 stars. it's better than A-OK, I am a fan.. i'll drink and eat to that... join me there haha..< /Text>

<Text>Twenty minutes to get a waiter. Twenty more to get the beer i ordered. Thirty min to get then salad, and over an hour for a pizza with dry stale character.  Salty toppings.

Place has gone down hill... Period.  Find a better place for pizza and somethimg resembling service.  Really too bad as i was a loyal customer for ten years.

Tried to get delivery to avoid glacially slow service i encountered last time.  Order taker asked me you are on x avenue between dairy and anza?  I say no geary and anza... YOu know one block up from you ...then he spells out d.a.i.r.y.?  … O.m.g. where is dairy st in s.f.? In the Richmond district?</Text>< pics>

< Review>
I'm going to preface this with this could possibly be an isolated incident and my uncle who I was with definitely escalated the situation but we had a horrible customer service experience at this location.

Angel who helped us was juggling multiple customers instead of just finishing up with us. She was dealing with a difficult customer who she muttered under her breath about in chinese as she knew he would not understand. Her and another employee tried to sell us the most expensive phones without knowing much about them (PS prices are better at other locations). They then proceeded to emphasize that they would not deal with any issues with our phone (4g was not working due to cricket activation which we found out later) because we had opened the back of a soft cover case without exposing any hardware.< /Review>

<review>My first visit was for information and comparing prices. By recommendation. When I returned to buy what I was looking for. They did not have it just on display, but they sold it to me and I would pick it up at a store down the avenues. I went to the store on Mission Street. Big surprise 40% less than the first. And customer service 100% quality.</review>< pictures>

Collecting money in this way will only make people think that we cricket collect black money. I have calculated, two SIM cards, charge $21.82, I do not count other things with you, I even count the money of the sim card. A sim card is $10.91, and you will be charged more than twenty. Are you deliberately trying to close Cricket? If so, I can report it to the boss.

关于sim卡我想问一下，一张$10.91的sim卡，为什么到你们这开线收钱，两张卡的钱收那么贵，两张sim卡收$50，如果我上报给老板，老板会怎么想？这样收钱只会让人家觉得我们cricket收黑心钱。我计算过了，两张SIM卡，收$21.82，我不跟你们算其他的，我就算sim卡的钱。一张sim卡$10.91，到你们这就收二十多。你们是存心想让cricket倒闭是不是？如果是这样我可以上报给老板。<//Text><resp>{'time': 1593470448093, 'text': 'We are sorry to see you had this experience.

<name>Alexa Hernandez</name><Time>1610449469061<//Time><Rate>3< /Rate><review>I came here like in the summer of 2017 to get my quince stuff because my quince was going to be in may 2018. They told us they were gonna give us a discount if we payed ahead of time, so we did it because we live in Washington. Worst mistake of our life. They never answered the phone and when they would, they said they would ship our order but they never would. Then they ended up blocking our phones and they tried to keep our money and not send our order. They finally ended up giving us our order like a month before my quince because we called the bank and they got threatened by the bank that we were gonna sue them of robbery, which is why they ended up shipping our order. The dress and all the accessories came fine and I thought everything was beautiful, except that they didn’t even include the copas de chambelanes that the set supposedly came with. But other then that, I received everything else and it came in beautifully condition, which is the only thing I liked about their service. I recommend this store ONLY if you live nearby and are gonna purchase the things the same day or pay after you receive everything, otherwise they WILL try to keep your money and block your number< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
I had such a great Experience here. The prices are very good.I had a last minute quinceañera and walked in into the store looking for the right dress .The dresses were so  beautiful. I walked in and The lady who assisted me was so nice. I told her I only had four days till then  and I needed my dress as soon as possible.She understood what I was going through and  assured  me shipping was going to be quick. She knew exactly what I needed. She knew what color would match my skin color and what size in dress I needed just by one look. She made me feel important. My dress came in the next day and it was amazing. She even gave me the skirt that makes the dress fluffy and big. My dress fitted me perfectly. I was so grateful. My party was amazing.< /Review>

Finally went to pick up the dress and they ordered it the wrong color. My niece was obviously disappointed. They still wanted her to try the dress on and were pushing for her to take it. They were very rude and making snide remarks. Don't bother coming here.< /Review>< date>

The staff are kind and they have many sizes to try on. They were so nice they let me try on my dream dress and let me borrow clips and a veil so I could see the complete look. I teared up it was so wonderful and bought both immediately and got to take them home that day! Not a fancy place, but beautiful wedding dresses at great prices. You can even negotiate a small amount to get an even better deal.

This store is great to get a quinceanera dress. I bought a dress for my daughter and it was perfect and she loved it. They gave it to us at a great price and we got it right away. I recommend buying your quinceanera dress here.</Review>

One employee specifically was truly rude and so unhelpful. Her name is Mary. I had called to see when i can pick up my dress and i was unfortunate that she picked up the phone. She did not give me the correct information about picking up the dress. Whoever is running this store is doing an awful job not to mention they selected terrible employees.</text>< Pics>

Please do not buy from this store. When we went to go look for dresses, they were nice so we bought a dress, but when we called to pick it up, they were extremely rude. The clients were already bad enough that they forgot to mention that the only day you can pick it up is on Sunday. Long story short, awful and unfriendly customer service.</text>

This is one of the worst place ever in Downtown LA.  Bought a quinceañera dress paid $1000 and it was not even worth the money. First they charged me twice when They called me I had to pay at least 1/2 the price to order the way I wanted. After that I asked to speak to the manager, she was never available (i dont think, they even have one). After 5 months that it was finally ready (when they initially had said 1month) they forgot to give me the hoop skirt that makes the dress look big. When i went to ask they said they couldn't give it to me because they already sent the receipt to storage?? They are so unprofessional and there is NO customer service at all. All of them have no manners on how to treat a customer. I guess that's why they are working there. I think they should go to at least a small training on what customer service is. So disappointed!!< /Text>

PLEASE READ!!!
THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE DESERVES NEGATIVE STARS IF POSSIBLE! I got 2 dresses from this store for my two girls. The first dress was what I ordered but the second dress was CROOKED A BOGUS DRESS. They said it was fine and they could make a illusion that it was straight that did not work. So they told me we'll have you a NEW DRESS BY THE BEXT WEEK. I go back the day they told me they would have my dress. When they put it on my daughter (mind you that my daughter is very short maybe 5 foot) the dress was up to her ankles and the corset string went half way down her back so the majority of her back was exposed! ANOTHER BOGUS DRESS! When I tell them I'm not taking the dress and that I was gonna take a picture of the dress they tried giving me , the owner storms from the back room (where she was listening to me through the door) and starts yanking the string from the dress, and in the process THEY SCRATCHED MY DAUGHTER IN THE BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE ANGRY THAT I WASNT TAKING THE MESSED UP DRESS . THE OWNER OR MANGER, WHOEVER IT WAS, STARTED YELLING AT ME " if your not gonna take my dress I want you out of my store" She snatched my receipt from my hand and told the worker to give me my money and she wants me out of her store. When I got to the counter to get my money back I wanted to see my receipt to see how much I get back and the lady said " no then your gonna take a picture of the receipt " I had no camera or phone in my hand, but she still didn't want to give me my receipt . By this time my daughter was fustrated angry and disappointed . She was by the entrance crying and shaking so when she heard me yelling to give me my receipt she came in the store and yelled at the lady "Give my mom get receipt " and the lady yelled back to my little girl "No because your going to take a picture " She had her phone in her hand because she was trying to call her dad so he can calm her down. So my daughter put her phone in her pocket and said " There now my phone is in my pocket now give my mom her receipt " As soon as she hesitantly gave me the receipt so I could look at it , the owner / manger came storming to me and yelled " If your not going to take my dress then you don't get to see the receipt " I was so pissed off already of how hurt my baby girl was. When she put the money on the table I snatched and got out of their store. I will never elk in that store again, and I don't recommend it to anybody. Getting a quinceneira dress is supposed to be magical experience but they turned my daughter's experience into a nightmare.  SERVICE WAS AWFUL! PEOPLE WERE RUDE! AND THE DRESSES WERE BOGUS DRESSES ! I was disgusted by this place but there was one kind, understandable worker there and her name was Elizabeth. Other than this person , all the people there our rude and disrespectful. Luckily I was able to visit a store a few stores down the same day called J & C Bridal who understood my situation and seen how destroyed my daughter was and were able to find a new dress in the back  that my daughter fell in love with. They were so kind and really saved the day! I AM WARNING YOU DO NOT GO HERE!</review>

Variety of Mexican products. But no sanitation protocols in place. Even though there are signs that a mask is mandatory to enter the store, the staff there doesn’t enforce it and thus there are people inside the store walking around without masks, with no social distancing enforced.< /Text>

I love this place, as a former long-term employee(5-10-18 to 5/2019 (I think the year's are right)) I can honestly say that William is a very loving and compassionate man, he's family oriented and is very positive, even when things are stressful and difficult, he keeps a smile on his face and gets what needs to be done, done. He was an amazing person to work for/with, he taught me a lot and gave me a chance to work at Rooster Wheels when I was homeless living in a van with my girlfriend at the time and our two dogs which William loved too, Breezy he says is a bunny, he really did more then a boss/coworker would ever have in any other situation, he became a really close friend of mine over the year I had been working there until my girlfriend broke up with me and I left, and quit working there, we still keep in touch from here and there, I hope this review helps some people understand that this place is simply amazing in every aspect thanks to William and his strength and will to be able to do what he does.</Text>

Amazing experience here. I brought my family of 6 in to rent bikes for the day. William took the time to outfit each of my kids (ages 4-12) with a bike that they liked. My wife and I both got cruisers.

The beach bike trail was right across the street, so we left our car there and spent the afternoon riding along the coast. Everyone had a great time.

When we returned, I liked my rental so much, that I asked William if I could buy it. He gave me a good price and  replaced the grips. I couldn't be happier with our experience there. I would recommend Rooster Wheels to anyone; large-familied or not!</Text>

Not a bad shop at all. Repairs are solid and the price is decent but turn around time is pretty long. I have had repairs done 3 times now at this shop and it has been over two week each time. In addition, I called to check on the status of the repairs each time the bike was in the shop and told I would be called back which I wasn't.

On the plus side, the owner of the shop is extremely nice and knowledgable.

Overall, if you don't need your bike for a few weeks, this is the shop for repairs and service done at a good price. If you want a quick turn around time, I would go elsewhere.</Review>

I took my bike here for repair on 1/20/20 it is now july and the owner William cannot find my bike. They actually offered me a different bike! This place is a rats nest of disorganization and clutter.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this bicycle chop shop.  Police Report Made. Its too bad there isnt a negative star rating.<//text>

Almost two weeks later I called and he was kinda rude to me and told me he would call me when it was done. I waited another day and just drove up there. To his defense hes really busy. I would just like from the start to for him to say it may take two weeks or more instead being put on hold and given the run around. If you don't mind your bike being in the shop for 2 weeks plus this is the for you. If your in a hurry I don't suggest this shop.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>William the owner is someone you would like to have your children grow up to be like him. Honest, friendly, hardworking, and fun to know! We arrive at the store and he came out of the store to ask if we needed help as I exited my vehicle. He removed my rear bike tire, checked for leaks, replace a tube, sold me a air pump, and of course with a great price. He offer information on local trails and his phone number if I need help on the bike or off. Wow - he got my business and future loyalty.</Text>< Rating>

Anyways, I took my bike in for a tune up, and it has never rode better than after the tune. Took only one day!  It was also quite a bit less expensive than I expected, but I think my expectations were high. Regardless, the price is very fair. I would definitely trust any bike to this shop  - good people, great service. I almost want to have more work done just to hang out at the shop!< /Review>< Pictures>

The owner William is very nice and offers high quality service and products. I recently bought a biking helmet and it's very comfortable and reliable. I highly recommend you stop by here if you are in need of anything bike related because you won't be disappointed.<//review>

Bicycke tourist!! Go here!! This place rocks. I actually went in just to ask for a tad bit of advise and see if I could make an exchange for some stuff I bought at REI. They were willing to look into a trade of sorts. Everybody was super nice and helpful. They tried to give me some free apples and were down for a short chat. I wish this place was my local bike shop! Even willing to install some parts for me. This place looks like it runs of passion and not money alone.<//Text>

<Text>I took my bike in for a taco'ed rim and some derailleur problems.  When I came to retrieve it, it wasn't ready yet.  I had been told it would be done and I was ready and dressed for a ride.  The owner lent me a brand-new Intense Primer for my ride, at no charge!  When I returned, my bike was finished, and it only cost me $100 (for a used rim install, new derailleur hanger and jockey wheel).  Great place!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808dfcd1429e03b5:0xfcaf6b33dc54852c</Gmap_id>< rating>

<Text>I rarely write positive reviews because quite frankly it’s seldom that I’m wowed by a customer service experience.  I needed the front break on my bike fixed and both of my tires were worn so I actually considered buying a new bike.  Instead I took my bike to Rooster Wheels in Marina with the goal of just getting the break fixed. The proprietor (William) was super friendly and indicated he could fix the break on the spot. He commented on the tires and I elected to leave the bike there for him to install new ones (tubes and tires). Less than 2 hours later he calls and tells me my bike is ready.  A break fixed, two new tires, prompt and friendly service -- $25. Wow, what a bargain!</Text>< gmapID>

<Text>This is my preferred grocery store in the area.  It's a little out of the way for me, but when someone says "groceries", this is almost always my choice.  It's very nice inside, the customer service has always been on point.  They have a full Pharmacy.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb796aaf39a29:0x9095869fb382ebee< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ive shopped there many times before due to its closeness to my place. This time was unacceptable and I truly hope to see improvement in my next visits otherwise I might have to consider the one on magnolia to get some BETTER service and some DECENT store cleanliness. It was overall a horrid  experience and i expected better response from the higher staff. I waited 30 mins to see manager and when finally attended she was unbelievably rude and dazed.

Might have to reconsider going here again.<//Review>

This store has great fruit and usually has paper products that may not be available at other stores. My sister will only eat Von's white bread. And I buy hash brown potato patties when they have them. Some things, such as milk, are more expensive here.<//Text>

Terrible customer service never wants to help at the customer service no one wants to work in this building very terrible place to come in and shop it's about the customers one or two cashiers maybe the best in the whole entire store it's a young looking Asian lady she's up in age but I say young looking she's been there for a long time she is the best she is so nice she's been there a long time I do not know her name I wish I knew it I am a local I shop here quite often but I do not want to come to this location because of the customer service no one wants to help...< /Text>

It is just a good Vons, friendly and open late most nights. Self check-out as long as you are not buying alcohol. Fresh veggies and meat, good deli and delivery if needed and so super affordable as well you may stop shopping for yourself.</Review>

<Text>Brianna Lambert the store director assistant is a bully that likes to make fun of customers. I overheard her making fun of my Uncle because he couldn't afford coffee. She is very unprofessional I don't even know how she still has a job. Never coming here again! The plaza one is better and they don't make fun of you or your family right in front of your face!<//Text>< pictures>

Very rude staff; I was trying to send money through western union and the guy told me he can’t send money through western union and went on talking to his colleague ignoring me.
The other occasion when I went to ask for chicken and the lady there said buy the spicy as I don’t want to waste food and cook a non spicy food. After these two incidence I will not go to this horrible place .<//Review>

< Review>
This is a really nice, clean store. I just moved to the area so I'm trying out every grocer within a half hour drive. There was a great selection of most things but my only hesitation is that there wasn't a huge selection of produce, acceptable but not amazing.  Maybe I'm mistaken but I think Vons are the same as Safeway and I know at Safeways the produce section can vary a lot by location.  The other thing I would like more selection of in an ideal world would be imports.  The international foods were very very limited. Everything they do carry was well stocked when I was there (Tuesday arvo) except a couple things people are still panic buying which is understandable. I appreciated too that there was a public toilet during covid times, a lot of places have them closed.< /Review>

Always very clean. Priced a bit higher than the Walmart next door, but fresh produce and meat are much better quality and worth the added cost. Great pharmacy with familiar faces, and always friendly. Lots of deals on water and gorgeous flowers.< /Review>

<username>Mary Rohner<//username><Review>I had only gone in for Arizona Rx Stress tea ( which they didn't have). I was all over the store trying to find it. I finally found where they had tea, it was way in the back ,behind cleaning supplies and detergents. I didn't find this a logical place for it.
But other then that it's a very neat, clean and bright store.
If you like flowers and plant arrangements, They had a beautiful array to choose from.
Could have had a little better customer service< /Review></record>

I like this cons, the sushi is great and I love the spicy tenders. Friendly staff and employees. Other than that you usually run into pan handlers outside. But I usually tell them about the shelters.< /review>

Store is very well kept and stocked. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Prices are on the high side compared to Stater Bros.  You have to use coupons to save money.<//Review>

<review>We visited this store simply because it was on our way home from another location, but we were very disappointed. The produce section was under stocked. We buy mostly organic and needed a squash, but there was only 1 squash left which didn't look too good, so we didn't get it. There were also several spots for Taylor Farms pre-packaged salads, but most were empty. Stock was low on several other items as well.

At our local Albertsons, the bakery department gives free cookies to the kids. We went to the bakery department here to see if they do the same, and there was one worker busy helping somebody else. We waited about 10 minutes and finally gave up. The employee was still helping the first customer, never acknowledged us (I think her back was to us and the other customer the whole time), and no other employees showed up to help out. When we left, 2 more customers had lined up behind us.

We also avoided purchasing several dairy items because they felt too warm to the touch. I would compare it to taking something out of your fridge and letting it sit on the counter at least 1 hour. Even items toward the back felt warm. I looked around for a thermometer to check the temperature, but there weren't any that I could see.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Their digital coupons rarely work. You will get ripped off more often then not. Keep a sharp eye out of you think you will actually save money with their awful app. I highly recommend a different grocery store chain that doesn't require digital coupons to save money.<//Review>

Floral department was very rude and not helpful at all. Their customer service sucks!  I believe the lady was named Robin. Not sure if she was floral manager or what. So I went to get balloons blown up and not even that long after, they were all on the ground so I went back and nicely asked if they could give me new ones or refund me since I got a big Bouquet of balloons for like $20 for my b -day party. She was like no we can’t do anything for you with attitude and was rude to me didn’t even say sorry or do anything to help resolve the issue. So after I asked multiple times what can she do for me it’s my b-day and I’d like to have some balloons today, she finally said I’ll give you two new balloons (out of like 12 that I had) and told the other lady to do it and then just walked away. The other lady was nice and apologized wished me a happy birthday and gave me an extra balloon with the two balloons. I Didn’t get her name, but she was polite to me. Anyways overall, I was not happy with this Vons and I’ve been shopping their for a long time. Don’t think I will be anymore. Waste of money on balloons and an inconvenience to have to go back for nothing!< /text>

People are nice, store is clean but too many time I have been walking in while someone is pulling a beer run and they go flying out the door. Almost been hit a couple of times by this. The store just let's them get away with it. Cashiers dont even flinch as kids run past with 2 twelve packs of beer in there hands.</Review>

Why do i need to apply for a free Vons member card to get the deals on the soda tags. This makes no sense. Im buying more than the required amount you should be happy i want purchase from you. Your not saving me any money. If you gave me an incentive with the membership & the purchase that makes more sense but if you know im a new customer & you see im buying more than 4 bottles you shouldnt give me a hard time to sign up for a card when its free & doing so im still getting them at the same advertised price. Does this make sense?<//Review>

People are nice, store is clean but too many time I have been walking in while someone is pulling a beer run and they go flying out the door. Almost been hit a couple of times by this. The store just let's them get away with it. Cashiers dont even flinch as kids run past with 2 twelve packs of beer in there hands.<//Review>

Ran to the store for a pizza for my kid meanwhile I decided to grab laundry soap while I was there 2 birds 1 stone kinda deal...
I was in the store maybe 5 min & I m guessing due to the huge sweatshirt I had on the manager was following me completely obvious...
I was actually offended
I wouldnt go back to this location again just for that reason alone</Text>

Kinda irritated with them today...as a customer I feel like if I call a store and ask if something is in stock, they should actually look...they didnt and told me they no longer carry something....low and behold i end up making the trip anyway and while looking for a replacement,  i find what I actually needed smh....< /Text>

It’s well stocked, it’s clean but.... the employees could use some training on “friendliness”.  I wanted to purchase an item that was not priced, I walked to an employee and asked if I could get a price on it.  The employee could not hide her disgust because she had to “check” for the price on a register, I asked if I could pay for the item with her and she quickly said No because she was not logged on?!!  She had just checked for the price!   Anyway, I thanked her, to which there was no reply.  I walked to another register, waited for my turn and once it was my turn to pay, the cashier scanned the item and said how much it was... she never greeted me and onced i payed she simply gave me my receipt and never said “thank you, have a nice day or thanks for coming in”. Why should I return to a merchant that does not appreciate my business. I rather drive to a further market, as long as I get the proper service and feel welcome.

Mr. Vons you need to do an Undercover Boss at this store!!!!<//text>

<Review>I seriously can't describe how much I hate shopping here. There is no staff in the butcher's area, one rude pharmacist, and maybe two checkout lines open if you're lucky.

Just go up the street to Albertsons, same products, same price, far better staff.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcb796aaf39a29:0x9095869fb382ebee<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This store is extremely unorganized and very under-staffed. There’s is always a long checkout line. When you can’t find items in their poorly organized store good luck to you because there is no one around to help!</Review>

The prices are very high. Still doesnt keep out the riff raff. Staff seems stuck up for what ever reason.< /Text>

I don't normally leave bad reviews but I felt that I had to on this occasion. I ordered a cake for a coworker on a Saturday. They stated I only needed 24 hr notice so I asked if it could be ready for Monday night. They said no because they didn't have a decorator on Mondays. Ok that's fine then I'll pick it up on Tuesday night. I asked for a picture on the cake like their display and they said they could do it if I brought in the picture. Which I did, a 5x7 to be exact. I show up Tuesday night only to find out they never made my cake. I was told that the order was placed to the side and must have been forgotten. The worker was very apologetic and stated her manager would reach out to me. The next morning I go back in to speak to the manager who told me they would make the cake if I still wanted it for another day at no charge. I thought that was really nice so I said ok and we scheduled it for Friday night (last night). I show up to pick up the cake around 10pm. I could not believe what was handed to me. Not only was the cake not what I ordered but it was made very poorly. The image I had provided was supposed to be across the entire top of the cake just like their display. The image on my cake was smaller than the picture I had provided!!! There was so much blank space all around the picture!!! It looked awful. And is if that was not enough, the screen printed message was tilted and not at all centered. It looked a mess. Unfortunately there was no I could talk to about it because it was after hours. I took the cake and brought it home. I couldn't even give it to my coworker, I was too embarrassed. I wish I would have taken a picture of the cake so you could see what a disaster it was. I would have much rather paid for a cake elsewhere if I knew they were going to waste my time like that. Super disappointed</Text>

Terrible Store.  I only go there because it's the closest and I dread it every time.  When you call, no one ever answers! You are on hold forever and the phone just keeps returning back to the main menu. It doesn't matter what time of day you call.  It's faster to drive down the store and ask the question in person!  It seems someone needs to know how to order better as a lot of the products have expired dates on them.< /Review>

Rip off!!! This store is a money pit. Most of the time they also gave rotten produce. Thanks for the years of RIP off but your bread is good. So basically lower your prices and you don't have to sell rotten vegetables... Also most of your meat sucks.< /text>

Great employees , will help with no problem and store is always clean! Rude customers however run rampant in this store ! Buying groceries at Vons doesn't give you the right to be a stuck up dick to the employees ! So if that is you, take a breathe and maybe go to another store where your rude behavior is acceptable .< /Text>

Only 2 of 8 check out lines were open with long lines.   And there's only one scale in the entire produce department to weigh items.   You need more than that.   People want,  and need, to know that they're buying the right amount of produce.< /review>
