<review>Nice beach to take a walk, ride a bike or walk your dog at.  Restaurant located here also.  Parking very congested, may take awhile to get a space.

Lots of interesting rocks on the beach and rock formations, small tidepool areas to explore.

During the early part of the day can be less crowded.  Weekends are very busy.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80e915b2b9159b4f:0x2671590cb3c73dbc<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is a nice, clean, and beautiful beach.
Things to know:
DOGS! YES! AND OFF LEASH so pups will be happy here.
Small amount of parking available.
Parking was free in the 2hr section.
Restaurant at entrance,  a little pricy ,but great. Get the calamari.

The beach is enclosed by rock face hills.
So much fun had here.

You will love it!</review>

< Review>
We're going back next month because the service the loveliness of course the view and the food could not have been more perfect. Adriel was our second meal  server and he was wonderful including his backup people.
Also we had the pleasure of meeting the manager because we complimented the tremendous service and experience.< /Review>

The ocean water was cold today, but perfect for the warm day. We also ate at the Boathouse. They have the best clam chowder. B.L.T's  aren't on their menu but when I enquired they accommodated. The bacon is Smokey and thick cut, the avocado was perfectly ripe. Yum, is all I can say . Beautiful day and wonderful time.< /review>

Great Dog beach.... Off leash, dramatic cliffs, not crowded. There's a parking lot and restaurant at the north end, a 200 step stairway down the cliff at the south end. Make sure you check the tide tables though, the beach shortens up quite a bit at high tide, leaving less room for the doggos to run around.<//Review>

It was relaxing and peaceful. We went for a nice walk. Dogs are allowed off leash once you pass sunbathers. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Herbert's beach is one of my favorites. The dogs there are lovely, and their humans are relatively polite. The slough is nasty, (DO NOT GO IN THE POOP WATER) but as long as you keep yourself out of it, it won't bother you (unless provoked). Seagulls are plentiful in case you're feeling peckish (no pun intended. Puns hurt feelings. I don't believe in hurting feelings.). The restaurant smells good, but I only ate there once when I was like 10 so my standards were low and I just had pancakes so I'm actually not sure whether their food is decent or not. Overall rating is an F for 'five-star'.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80e915b2b9159b4f:0x2671590cb3c73dbc<//GmapID></record>

Great beach to take your dog to. There weren't a lot of people there so my son was able to play ball with our dog and run around. There was also plenty of parking when we arrived.</Text>

I should be clear, this is for the Boathouse Restaurant: I've been coming here for many years, and this was the best experience I have had. We were anxious when we arrived as the beach and the restaurant were packed, and a lot of folks weren't wearing masks. However within 20 minutes (the exact wait time we were told to expect), we were lucky enough to be seated outside the patio area along the walk in front of the restaurant, well separated from other tables and people. We had a surprisingly good, interesting cocktail, followed by an amazing seafood platter...the middle size was perfect for 2 for a meal, and everything was very fresh and delicious. A lot of variety as well...clams, mussels, oysters, shrimp, crab legs, ceviche, poke. My only very small complaint was the amount of lettuce/cabbage the ceviche sat on in proportion to the amount of ceviche. While it is not inexpensive, I did think it was fairly priced for the quality and quantity. Their wine selection was quite good, with some nice and unexpected local selections. We had a favorite Sauvignon Blanc from a relatively small producer and it was surprisingly reasonably priced. I appreciate this; knowing a bit about wine and retail costs, i get very frustrated when restaurants jack up the prices unreasonably high... it's the difference between them selling me a glass or a bottle, so worth keeping the prices appropriate.  The service was really good...our server was experienced, very polite and warm but professional. She was knowledgeable about the menu, and when asked, she articulately expressed her opinions, which I VERY much appreciate in a server who really knows the menu. She guided us perfectly. We also didn't feel rushed despite it being a fairly busy evening. Quite honestly, I've always come here for the location in the past, but after this experience I will be returning more frequently for the food and beverages. Overall an outstanding experience.</Text>

<review>Went to the Boat House restaurant here. 2 hour wait which is apparently normal for a Sunday afternoon but it was a nice wait just sitting on the beach. Had a quinoa bowl and it was fantastic!</review>< username>

Our dogs loved running in the water and sand; we loved watching all of the dogs have a blast. We got lucky and found a parking spot when someone else was backing out. The dog washing station was a nice touch. Our only problems were that one of the three wash stations was broken and the station we used wouldn’t let us swipe for another 10 mins (we have two dogs with lots of fur.)< /text>< Pics>

This little gem is super worth the drive from Thousand Oaks for us! Both of our dogs love this beach! It's very clean and everyone picks up after their dogs. Pretty much every dog that we've encountered at this dog beach was super friendly too!! 🐶🐕🐩</review>< pictures>

Stopped by this nice beach away from tourist spots. A great surprise is to spot a couple of dolphins swimming closed by. Really cool.</review>

Nice beach if down by the Santa Barbara area. If you have dogs and want them to roam free this is the spot to do it in. A bit chilly so dress accordingly.</Text>

A fun beach to hang out at. Small parking lot, a little lookout point, a restaurant and some restrooms, and, of course, the beach. Sometimes it can be pretty crowded, but often as not it isn't, leaving you plenty of space. The water can be pretty chilly, so be prepared for that!</text>

<Text>I grew up near here and spent a lot of time at Hendry's as a kid.  Now i spend a lot of time here with my own children.  We love it here....our "locals" beach.  Also known as The Pit to a of us long time Santa Barbarans.  One side is off leash dog friendly the other is on leash walking.  Lots of tidepools at low tide.  Parking cam definitely be a challenge especially on a beautiful day.  There is a restaurant ( The Boathouse) on this beach which also makes parking a challenge.  Famy friendly beach.  It does get crowded at times but you can usually find a spot even on the most crowded days.  Can be foggy from time to time eben when there is no fog anywhere else.  Can usually see dolphins out in the water, birds diving for fish, etc.  A great local hangout!<//Text>< GmapID>

<text>Hendry's Beach never fails to deliver with the goods everytime I find the time to make it there to get some.  The only real downside is that if you aren't lucky enough to be handicapped and were given the coveted blue tag that hopefully would be hanging from your rearview mirror ready to give you the primo parking spot you deserve... Your stuck circling the lot until some guys feels like he's had enough good for one time and you can have it.

Normally this tends to happen right after the sun sets..<//text><response>None< /response>< Date>

Most of the staff is not friendly. I stopped by today and was attended by an older Asian lady. I thanked her and she said nothing. So I sarcastically said "thank you" again, and still silent. So I said "your welcome. So rude". I only go there because it is 5 minutes from my home.</review>

The employee who works there with a piercing on her eyebrows is extremely rude/ghetto. She couldn’t answer any of my questions about the passports. Go with a real agency who actually knows what they’re doing.<//Text>

My experience in renewing my passport was so unpleasant they made me go 3 times for the same renewal paid for pictures twice and made me pay for my passport again because of a postal clerk that didn't know what proper documents to send with my application.
I dont recommend you do your passport process here go with proper agents that actually know what there doing.< /review>

I usually don't post anything but these people are right on they really do have bad customer service and I've even seen them bickering at each other out loud when customers are present and when a customer asks for some thing since they are mad they answer rudely over and over again. May be one of these days someone will video tape and post it so there bosses can see what really going on.</text>

Horrible place. I only went because I had to renew my passport, but my god, does this place suck. This guy, I think his name was Adam, literally made me jump through fire. He kept giving me misleading and contradictory information, and made me come back three times. When I asked if I could call next time so I wouldn't waste our time, he said, "don't call. Just show up." When I was finally finishing up my documents, he kept denying other customers because "he didn't have change for 20's" until the other employee told him that he couldn't keep denying everyone and had to get the change from the back. He makes life difficult for everyone because he obviously hates his job. I just wish they'd hire better people.<//text>

For a long time I thought that this was the only Post Office in the area.
It USED to be very good, and the people that worked there were always friendly and helpful. In fact, I would go there almost every weekend to buy a stamp for my collection.
I stopped collecting when a young me was faced with rude and disgusting behavior. There's just things you don't say to children, and it's stayed with me into adulthood.

I've hated having to come here for nearly 15 years after that incident, but luckily that ended about 4 months ago I found the Huntington Park branch. Not only is it closer to where I live and on my way to one of my jobs, but the people that work there are so nice! It made me realize how terrible this one was.

This Post Office gets one star because they are open on Saturday with limited hours.
Though, I will NEVER be back after what happened to me last weekend.
I was attempting to mail an international package, and there were no custom forms out. So, I waited in line and spoke to an attendant. They insisted I didn't need a customs form on an international package. I said that it was proper protocol, as I mailed out packages like these at least four times a week. Five minutes of this back and forth later I had customs forms flung at me and was told "Fine. Let's see if they get there or not." Her tone indicated that she had no intention of letting my package get to its destination because I was ruining her day with the extra information a customs form required or something.

I didn't even risk it.
I took the forms, notified my customer that their package would be delayed, and went home.

Don't go here unless you're in a dire hurry.
They treat you like dirt on the bottom of their shoe.</Text>

<Text>They always deliver my eBay pakages to the wrong address. I finally didn't get one at all . Maybe the person that's got it was fed up and threw it in the trash.  And also I have missing credit card bills.  I called my cc company and they said that the enveloped where returned.  This is not a sorting issue it's the mail man .  7 ebay packages have been delivered  wrong and they won't even return a claim email.  Fedex,ups,dhl,amazon,pizza guy always finds my house number....< /Text>< Pictures>

I don't know what the fudge is wrong with the relievers keeps sending my expensive packages somewhere else. I lost one already and complained twice on this office! If the package returned this time is unsatisfactory to the expensive value, your office should pay me the original value.<//Review>

Bad customer service came in twice and each time a different excuse to why they couldn't help me with the passport , it was 12:00 and they close at 2:00 and they told me 'we are short staffed and are not taking applications anymore' . Being short staffed isn't a customer issue ,they should be able to handle the daily demand regardless of their employees like any other job does< /text>

I was greeted by the very professional Bryan.  My car had stopped and I couldn't drive it.  Bryan made me feel so much better.  He towed my to the auto repair shop and dropped me off at home.  I simply LOVED his attitude and conversation.  Bryan keep up the good work and I know you have a promising career ahead of you.  Thank you so much.<//text>

I was so satisfied with the service that Daniel provided DANIEL IS THE GOAT the greatest of all time  !! HE HANDLED my car with such great care and got it where it needed to go without me being there! His Attitude was so uplifting and refreshing him showing up was the highlight of my week°°!! He is so awesome please SOMEBODY GIVE HIM A RAISE OR SOMETHING HE WORKS WAY TO HARD he got to me in less than 15 minutes and had my vehicle on the way in less than 10 he was super understanding with my financial situation and offered solutions to help reach a consensus and man was I BLESSED to have been taken care of by DANIEL!!!!< /Text>

The driver was very professional, very friendly, and very understandable. Unfortunately, I did not get his name but he picked up my Camaro and took it to the collision center, we had some obstacles with the towing yard, not his company but the original towing company that took the car during the accident And once again, he was very understandable and waited until the car was released to him. Outstanding service!!!!<//Text>

< Review>
Manny came to my home in Lake Arrowhead with my disabled vehicle in the driveway. Within 15 mins the my car was loaded onto the flatbed truck. When AAA gave me the link for Manny’s ETA, he came faster than what I thought. I arrived at the dealership in Ontario at exactly the time I estimated. Manny provided excellent service and he is a model for which other roadside technicians should strive to be. Roy and Dot’s Towing has a wonderful person in their midst! Manny has a huge heart! Thank you so very much!!</Review>

Got my car towed to my local mechanic, and the gentleman that showed up was very professional, wore a mask, validated my credentials, and took it right over. I could not ask for a better experience. Five stars!<//Review>

Honestly what a great tow truck driver. Was stuck up in Crestline and the local company just wouldn't show up for whatever reason. This guy showed up and was very polite and took care of everything, only complaint which I'm not too sure who's to blame was that when AAA called me to tell me that they found this company that they were 2 to 3 hrs out and would call me to let me know when they'd be there, instead I got a text message saying they were 30 Mins away! Lol so I left work and headed to the house to make sure someone would be there to relieve the truck. It took about an hr from the time I got called by AAA to having a tow! Unbelievably great really but I do feel the company should call to confirm. Other than that it was a super streamlined and excellent experience so I'm giving this company 5 stars!🌟🤩✨<//Review>

Thank you Roy and Dots towing. Your driver was courteous and professional. He picked up my truck and took it to  to the AAA approved tire shop when I got a flat tire on the freeway. The tire shop couldn’t accommodate my tires, so the driver went back and picked up my truck and took it to another shop That was capable of Replacing a 26 inch tire. I was not at the first location when he arrived to pick up my truck. He called me to verify that that’s what I wanted. I was very grateful for the extra effort on his part of making that extra phone call to verify the change.I definitely would recommend Roy and Dots towing to anybody that needs a tow.<//text>

Bob was my savior!! Other companies wouldn’t help out because of curfew even though that’s their job so the curfew won’t apply! From being frustrated Bob made it end a great way he got there very fast! Super friendly, knowledgeable, taught me a few things, very professional and courteous! For any future services I will be back! Thank you BOB!<//Review>

Professional and Punctual. Angel was there 20 mins earlier than expected and towed our car from lake arrowhead to san juan capistrano.
Cant ask for better service when it comes to the tow industry. Hands down best service we've ever received.</Review>

I have dealt with many tow companies in my time. By far, Roy and Dots Towing is the best. Bob was awesome and the most professional driver I have ever dealt with in the towing industry. He took care of my car like it was his own. Something you dont see from other tow companies. When I need a tow from now on, I will request Ray and Dot's Towing. GREAT JOB<//Review>

Vicent was well-mannered,  dressed professional,  and  made me feel comfortable about towing my 2007 Audi. He also assured me that he would make sure my tow bar was placed back and windows closed. Furthermore,  he called to let me know the car was dropped off at my mechanic in Orange. Thank you again Vincent and Roy & Dot"s . I know it wasnt a fun tow due to the distance,; nonetheless,  AAA has great connections with amazing company's.  Amen!!! Sincerely, HLD</text>

<review>Awesome experience today with Roy & Dots Towing.  Came for a tow via Geico. Very knowledgeable and friendly in person and on phone.  Tried to crank car, said battery and then threw on a battery pack and car cranked right up!  Diagnosed it perfect.

Great service and accurate diagnosis.  Even a couple minutes early on arrival!  Thanks, Roy & Dot's Towing!!!</review></record></dataset><record>

Quick and amazing service. Very friendly. They got me off the side of the freeway pretty quickly, and the driver, Bob, was excellent at assisting me and my vehicle! Very careful and caring--he even drove me towards the nearest exit to guide me to where I needed to go, so that was really appreciated! Definitely would recommend if you need fast help with customer service.< /review>

This is a very good tow company. I didn't get the driver's name, but he. was very professional and polite. They kept in touch with me to let me know when they would arrive. I would hire them even if I wasn't covered by my insurance company.. I give them five stars on every thing.</text>

Roy and Dots Towing was amazing from the time I called until the time they got me out of the mud. Angel was the driver whom came to “rescue” me. I was having a terrible morning and I was not in a very good mood, but Angel was sweet helpful and had a great sense of humor. He really turned an unfortunate situation into a great customer service experience. I will NEVER forget how he went above and beyond for me and my sanity. Lol. This guy Angel was in the mud in the water in the cold shoveling mud and still kept a smile on his face the whole time. I truly appreciate great customer service and Angel did just that. Thank you Roy and Dots Towing for hiring someone whom represents your company in such a wonderful way. I will definitely recommend you guys and thank you for turning a terrible start of my day into a great experience. Angel don’t ever change your wonderful customer service skills. Roy and Dots Towing 👍🏼Keep up the great work.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Excellent service. My disabled car was quickly loaded onto the flatbed and I rode with the driver to the repair shop.  The total cost was less than I expected to pay.</Text>

The guy OMG was so unprofessional he’s was trying to flirt with me the entire time so much he forgot to tie one of the hooks when we took off. Almost damaged my car. Than he said o it’s because your your emergency brake wasn’t on and tried to blame it on me. Hope I never get a tow from this company and after on the ride he was like can you get on the internet and give me a good review they give bonuses for me. Like seriously after that hell no
Think he’s name was Vincent or victor has tattoos I was so uncomfortable in the truck😒</review>

Bob , the driver assigned to pick up our car was very professional, came on time and followed up with me by phone about status of my wife’s car (a newer model Mercedes Benz C300) he delivered to our mechanic at Walnut Hills Auto Repair. He knows his responsibilities and sticks by the AAA strict standard. Bob is knowledgeable and dependable. I highly recommend Bob and the company he represents. Good job Bob!👍👍👍...

<Text>Roy & Dot's Towing were very prompt. I was told they would be at my home in an hour and the driver, Miguel, was there half-hour before. Miguel was very pleasant and courteous! My only fault was with myself in that I did not have any cash on me to tip him when he delivered my vehicle to the dealer. Kudos to Miguel and Roy & Dot's!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Name>

<review>Miguel was awesome. I have a 2006 Bmw 750 Li and two other tow trucks came prior and because my car didnt go into neutral, they couldnt help me.  Because of this issue, i had to leave my car overnight and deal with it in the morning. Miguel came with perfect knowledge of my car, used my key to unlock the gears down by the break and also showed me that i have a tow hitch in my trunk. Amazing!!. Thank you Miguel so much.<//review>< Pictures>

After waiting hours for another tow company my insurance company contacted Roy and Dots Towing . They arrived quickly and driver was courteous and professional.  I didn't have to do anything as he handled it all, even when dropping vehicle off at repair. Thank you Roy and Dots.</Review>

After waiting hours for another tow company my insurance company contacted Roy and Dots Towing . They arrived quickly and driver was courteous and professional.  I didn't have to do anything as he handled it all, even when dropping vehicle off at repair. Thank you Roy and Dots.</Text>

<review>I needed my truck towed to a repair shop. Whitin minutes of calling, I received a text saying a driver was on the way, and a few minutes after that, Angel was at my apartment gate! Extremely fast service, and Angel is kind, friendly and professional. I will use this tow service again!<//review><UserId.>106432123072053011392<//UserId.>< resp>

Thieves Thieves Thieves. when I called to report almost 15k worth of goods stolen they never responded. Then I went in to make a in-person report I waited 2 hours for some fat smelly woman to come talk to me and she said "our cameras don't work" and when i asked to talk to the owner she told me "he's helping poor people." Since my iPhone was stolen i went to find my iPhone and guess where the last spot was it was on. Right here at roy and dots. Then I met one of there drivers who sold me some drugs. He was cool and told me the fat woman is always the one stealing but since she's the supervisor she gets away with it.</text>

<review>They arrived sooner than I was told, towing service contacted me within minutes of AAA contacted them. Then I was greeted and helped by Bob who fixed my car and was incredibly nice in a day when everything seemed to be going wrong. Thank you for the help, the speed in which you handled it and the encouragement (which is not typically included) :)< /review>< pics>

Tim was early and took his time to insure our classic car, with special towing needs came off the truck in the same condition it went on. Then he helped push it into the garage.  What more could you ask for.<//text>

They not only charge prices not allowed in regards to towing fees they also don't care of anyone knows or they can't do anything about it. The half owner enjoyed spending 10 mons cussing and yelling at me which I advised him I was recording it and he said he didn't give @$*& of I was. They overcharge on hourly rates and pick up fees<//Review>

<text>Used to work for dave it was the biggest mistake I've made he thinks because he is having money problems he doesn't have to pay his employees or fix the crappie trucks he has still owes me, ex and current employees money and instead of making payroll he will faithfully buy Dodger tickets and hit the bar down the street after work. I'm surprised he hasn't ended up in jail for all the shady things he does...... I suggest everyone take their money elsewhere. It's just a matter of time before aaa finds out everything about this clown they will cut him off like Rialto PD and other agencies did ... Pass this info on< /text>< Rating>

Not giving it 5 stars because nothing beats the one (that was) on Clairemont Mesa Blvd. But it's still nice to know there's still a Panda Country. Also, some of the best dishes are available here. 🐼< /Text>

This restaruant has an amazing menu to choose from. We ordered shrimp lomein and I believe it was curry shrimp but it was delicious the only concern was how fast the food was cooked because upon eating it, I bit into a cold chicken. Luckily I did not get sick but the food was very delicious over all.<//text>

<Review>Pretty tasty! Have the three ingredient taste lunch special and surprisingly was pretty decent quality I'd never been there before but I always thought it was a fast food joint. However, I was very mistaken the hostess with very nice and professional. I think I will be back soon!</Review>< gmapID>

Good food, reasonably priced, quick friendly service, outdoor seating was offered but opted for pick up. Had the kung pao chicken and fried pot stickers. Aside from the chicken not being as spicy as I would have liked, it was tasty. The pot stickers were delicious.</text>

<Review>Don't typically like to leave bad reviews, however the food I received warranted this. My girlfriend and myself both received incredibly soggy food, and the rice tasted old. The egg flour soup had literal raw egg still inside of it. We ended up throwing away a good amount of the food and went elsewhere to eat. This overall was a really bad experience and they need to get it together.</Review><gmapID>0x80d957ffcdee700d:0x86fc0d037473216e<//gmapID>< Resp>

We had food delivered from here a few nights ago and it was delicious so we decided to go into the restaurant and get more food. It was really good. But our youngest has been throwing up since 3am and hasn't been able to sleep well and I have been dealing with stomach pains and nausea since 2am so unfortunately as good as the food may be, we won't be returning here or ordering for delivery from here. Not sure what it was but the sweet and sour pork has given our poor baby food poisoning and possibly me as well.

Update:
After I myself having to throw up and d several times, we definitely won't come here again. I won't risk our health to food poisoning again.<//text>

We ordered an appetizer which literally took 45 minutes to come out. We ordered two entrees and one came and the other never came until we had finished our first and just asked for check. Then they said what about other entree and we just had it boxed to go. Service really is bad here. Don’t know why entrees did not come out together. Will not be back.<//review>

I order the salt and pepper wings they were way too salty and I only got the back part of the wings not even one single chicken drumette, the skin was very burnt, and the meat was dry. The sweet sour sauce was not enough to cover the sweet and sour pork oh and the  pork was very chewy. I did not get a fork or chopsticks. I will not be ordering from here again.😠< /text>

Friendly staff! Family style dinner specials are large portion sizes, more than plenty. Egg drop and hot and sour soup were flavorful and delicious. Egg rolls and wontons were great starters. Garlic pork was spicy...perfect flavor. The sweet and sour chicken was good. The fried rice was not my favorite, would chose steamed rice next time.<//Review>

< Review>
Overall, not bad. It's not the best, but it's still better than places like Panda Express. I was in the mood for something not as fattening as other fast food joints and didn't want to wait too long. So I had GrubHub take out of this place. It's a bit better than the normal Chinese food of other places. The dishes were not greasy or oily and you get a fair serving size. A good value for the price.</Review>

By far our favorite Chinese Restaurant.  The food is terrific.  The service extraordinary!  We have introduced our family and friends and now it is their favorite Chinese too.  The House Special Chicken has just the right amount of spiciness.  We love all the Egg Foo Yong dishes.  I particularly like the sauteed shredded chicken.  Then again, we haven't had a dish we didn't like.  My mom is a vegetarian and loves all their vegetable dishes.</Text>

Best Chinese food. I took my husband here and he loves the orange chicken. We have been to a lot of other places in Las Vegas and Utah and this place is by far the best. All the food is amazing. My favorite is the orange chicken, black pepper beef, and the pork fried rice.<//review>

<name>Matthew Jakubczak</name><Review>This place has become my family's favorite go-to for a good Christmas dinner. While I typically deplore the idea of making anyone work on such a holiday, I am not going to turn down a family dinner, and this place has earned our business 3 years running. The food is always very, very fresh. The ingredients are all very well picked, fresh, and you can taste the quality as opposed to many others. When going for Chinese lately it seems that Panda Express is about the level of quality you can expect in most places, where you can tell the meat is drowned in sauce to try and cover up the fact it is low quality, but not here. As far as I can tell, all the ingredients are what would be a first round choice, and they don't simply try to hide the flaws the meat or veggies may have by covering them with excessive sauce or a crunchy outer shell.

The actual restaurant has downsized a little from the first time we went, which unfortunately without a reservation could mean you will be stuck waiting for another party to finish before you can be seated. But the actual food os worth the wait, and while they don't blatantly rush you through your meal, they will make sure you're satisfied in a timely manner so they may serve other customers. We did not feel rushed, our drinks were kept full, and the food came relatively quickly, which made it easier to eat then go tour the Christmas lights around town. Even with the downsizing, the dining area was not cramped; in fact it seemed like the tables were spread out a little better adding to the comfort for the meal.

The menu is very comprehensive, guaranteed to have something for everyone, with pictures and actual brief descriptions so you arent left totally guessing what is what. I chose the Crispy Beef, which is similar albeit much better than Panda Express' Beijing Beef. The difference that stood out to me was the fact there were good chunks of beef, and what I assume was a rice wine vinegar in the sauce that gave it an almost pickled taste that really worked well.

If you are looking for a quality Chinese place around town, you surely cannot go wrong giving Panda Country a try.< /Review>< Pictures>

Amazing service, most bang for your buck! Ordered kung pow chicken, steamed rice and egg rolls for myself and what showed up was enough to feed an army with every condiment i could possibly need or want! Combine that with the speedy service and order accuracy from grub hub, my night was made! Highly reccomend this place and will be ordering from them again.</text>

I've been going to this restaurant since the eightys. I moved out of state and make a point of coming back. However, they have now changed owners and they don't use the same recipes. I was really disappointed with food!

The food overall was fair. However our order did not come with fried rice as stated in the order. When I called about the mistake they did not seem apologetic. Overall there are a lot of Chinese food places and they did not eat our business based on today’s experience.</Text>

We have enjoyed coming to this restaurant for 40 years.  Under new management this is the WORST FOOD we have ever had.  My husband got take out tonight, we had to throw out $32.00 of food that was NOT etible.  The rice was dry and hard, the House Special Chicken was so tough you couldn't even chew it, my husbands Beef With Oyster Sauce was so bad it was also thrown out.  We will NEVER eat in this restaurant again, HORRIFIC food!  A sad change in a restaurant we have loved for so many years!!< /Review>

All the classic Chinese dishes, food appearance and taste is excellent. Orange chicken had just enough spice with a fresh orange taste. Teriyaki chicken and Sweet n Sir chicken were terrific. Waitress was funny, passant, and efficient. Overall best Chinese restaurant I've been to in a very long time.<//review>

I just have to say we have celebrated New Year's eve dinner from here over 15 years.Have never minded spending the extra money because food always so good, except this year.  This year very disappointed. Chinese and Mushroom had only regular mushrooms. And Kung Pao made with tiny shrimps and not spicy at all. Orange chicken mostly orange peels.had more orange peels. I am only posting here because there is no contact form on web site and don't really think they care anyway. Just wanted to caution on ordering these items.< /text>

Fried rice was just browned rice with no egg, peas, or letuce. House special chicken was almost all breading, and very bland. Couldnt eat it, thew it in the trash and ate a 2 day old sub sandwiche. If your missing your cat, im pretty sure i just ate some of your beloved pet.</review><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) It's delicious. I want to eat it for my family. I say that the staff is very beautiful and the owner is handsome. I like a shop that’s great. It’s delicious. You eat it and you want to give it to your family. You say yes, the staff is beautiful, the boss is handsome, very nice

<Review>Went there to pick up a package. Ups said they would be open. Waited for 1 hour no one came to the door. The phone numbers they has on the door did not work. Myself and 5 other people waited for someone to come to the door. Waist of my time. Terrible experience< /Review><user_name>Juju&KD The Green Boys<//user_name>< resp>

December 2020: DON'T GO HERE. UPS is too callous towards its customers to update information, but this facility is CLOSED.  And good luck getting anyone to answer those phone numbers.</review>

Terrible company. I cry every time I see my package is coming from this location. When they state my package is out for delivery they delay it for days at a time. The drivers constantly say they missed me even though I was home all day.</review>

I will never in my life get anything delivered from UPS. THEY NEED TO HIRED BETTER EMPLOYEES. I NEVER RECEIVE ANY OF MY PACKAGES BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS DELIVER TO AN ADDRESS I HAVEN'T BEEN IN 10 PLUS YEARS. WHEN THE SHIPPING ADDRESS IS CLEARLY DIFFERENT AND SPEAKING TO DIFFERENT CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVES MULTIPLE TIME MAKING SURE THEY DELIVER TO THE CORRECT ADDRESS AND SAMETHING OVER AND OVER. I WOULD GIVE THEM NEGATIVE STARS IF I COULD. VERY DISSATISFIED WITH UPS. IT HAPPENED 6 TIMES.<//review>

4/24/2020 - Iv'e been tracking my ups package for 3 hour. on 4 occasions the driver was 1 to 2 blocks away from me but kept driving further away all 4 times.   On 2 occasions the driver was at the same spot for half hour to 45 min, then by the Sherman Indian school for a half hour than headed south and back to March Air Field. Than at 903 pm my tracking stopped and never came back.< /Text>

<review>I never wright bad reviews but it's time because UPS deserves it.
Third time our shipment is lost at this location  it's international shipment 30lb boxes and they cant find it. We run small business and every lost package hurts us big time. We even vent to this location but no one cares not even trying to look for it.  Very disappointed.... will avoid UPS in future!< /review><Response>None</Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>E.

I am so sick and tired of  UPS. I live in Mead Valley and they have yet to be able to deliver a package. They say in the tracking system that it's been delivered obviously it's a lie when I dispute the package being delivered I get nowhere with customer service. It is impossible for the driver to deliver to my door step as they claim since I have a 6' fence or around my yard the driver needs to be fired.<//text>

Okay so FedEx, Amazon and the USPS are just magically able to deliver to me then? UPS is a joke and would never use their services again if I was able.

<Text>The "supervisor" Allison has the worst customer service EVER!! She hung up in my face because I was frustrated with their delivery process. My package was supposed to be delivered on the 24th, then the 25th now the 28th because of the address, which was correct. The fact that I talked to somebody regarding the issue & was supposed to be fixed & delivered to UPS on Freddrick @2:30 on the 25th, I called this morning & its still wasn't delivered.smh I will DEFINITELY make sure my packages doesn't go through this UPS facility now that I know they're franchise. Don't deserve the one star but its the only way to write a review on these people<//Text><userid>117859484811254781424</userid>< GmapID>

Also, be aware of receiving the wrong stuff in your package! 3 different times, from Amazon and Kohl’s I have received my package late and with a completely different item inside.

<review>In my many years of receiving deliveries, once a driver said attempted delivery when he did not, I had taken the day off work. Now I just have them hold it and go pick it up. They are usually not too busy and handle things quickly. Overall I am happy with them. Only one problem in 12 years. Those are pretty good odds.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>Ups delivery driver in my area, won’t drive up my paved driveway. Likes to leave packages leaning against my open gate fence post  500’ from my house. Attracting Criminal behavior! Almost looks like it’s a setup for a criminal it’s so ridiculous! Or doesn’t even try and puts the missed delivery sticker on my mailbox. Driver’s lie about even trying, waited many times for packages to sign for all day! Then I have to go to their pickup site 40 minutes away, because it was to inconvenience for the driver to pull up my driveway.< /Text>< Response>

I love the people who work here. Always friendly and helpful. One gentleman that works there even offered to tape up a couple spots that I was having problems with on my item today! They do seem understaffed at times and the hours are strange, though. And also UPS’s policy of requiring an actual UPS Store for a lot of things is dumb, but you can’t fault the employees for that stuff.< /review>

UPS drivers in this region are the most incompetent I have ever seen. For years, they have been delivering my packages to my neighbor's and I complain and it does no good. Same old terrible service. Unreliable. I have a table on my porch for delivery. They STILL put my packages on the sidewalk, in the sun and my medications melt. Thousands of dollars worth of cancer meds, left in plain view, when I have a table, not visible from the street enclosed on my porch. There are signs and arrows giving directions and the drivers are too dumb to make proper deliveries
..if they even get to my house instead of my neighbor's homes.</Text>

<review>Came in at 11am Monday morning (02/27) and the employee in the main guy in counter gave me attitude.  Wasn't even there ready to help, and he didn't even hand me the receipt, just threw it on the desk. Kinda ironic how the place is called Customer Center, and the customer service sucks. Other than that you guys do great!< /review>< pictures>

Terrible services, UPS drivers are a trash!! I was off expecting this package waited outside my house for one and a half hours. Recheck the websites tracking info and stated attempted delivery when I was outside!
"The company or receiver name is incorrect. This will delay delivery. We're attempting to update this information." How do you know the name is incorrect if you weren't there!< /review>

<Text>This location and it's drivers are hands down the worst. They never deliver on time, then you have to come pick it up yourself because they drive past your house and say they made an "attempt", and when you finally get your package, it looks like it's been in a gang fight! And good luck with the customer service...the city morgue has more life flowing through it.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< Review>
Driver should have left 2 of the exact same packages today. Drive arbitrarily made the decision to leave one and require a signature for the other, so one of my boxes did not get left. Drive also left the one package that was delivered out in the open where it was exposed to the wind and people driving by, when the package could have been pushed up against the wall and door where it would have been safe. TERRIBLE customer service when I called to find out what the heck happened. I now have to wait through the weekend for a box that was urgently needed today.</Review>

I dont understand how a package can arrive here and not make it out for days, or it will leave the facility but then be back by night, how hard is it to deliver a package that is 10 minutes away from the facility?<//text>

Ordered a shirt which was supposed to arrive on Good Friday, (The Friday before Easter Sunday). Paid extra for 3 day shipping. UPS screwed up and there was a sorting error on my order. Long story short...my order arrived late, not on time for Easter as was the original plan. Was reimbursed for shipping but that doesn't
put the shirt on me for Easter Sunday. Epic fail on customer service. The box looked like it was used as a football too. Very disappointed.</review>

I had a package delivery attempt made to my house. Calling their telephone number and getting an operator on the phone is tricky. There's no initial option for speaking with an operator even if you keep saying, "Operator." I had to 1st track my package, 2nd tell the automated machine that a second delivery attempt the following day would not work for me, and 3rd finally be connected to a live operator to tell her that I'd rather pick up the package that evening. It was also difficult to understand the operator's English. I'm not very picky and do well with accents but this one was frustrating. Bottom line: if you want to talk to an operator say, "track package," say your tracking number, and wait for the information. Then when the operator tells you that a second attempt will be made the next day, is this okay? Say, "No." You will be connected with a live operator. Note that this works when there has been an unsuccessful delivery attempt. I'm not quite sure how it would work if the package was still out for delivery.</text>

THE WORST UPS HUB EVER. 2 packages that were supposed to be delivered this week all say "information unavailable" and "package delayed due to carrier blah blah" after 3 days of the tracking info telling me my package was out for delivery today. One package I paid $30 for next day air, and 3 days now it said out for delivery and I still have not got it!!! The first day they left it at the site and didn't even load it on the truck when it said it was out for delivery. They had to open an investigation because now apparently my over-night package is lost. This hub is BY FAR the WORST ups hub. Horrible organization and even worse customer service.</review>

I have had two packages disappear into limbo probably never to be seen again because you jerks insist on delivering them to the PO instead of my home. The frigging address is where I live, not where I get my damned mail. Who knows what the PO does with them since they cannot be delivered to the shipping address. I" outraged. I have to pay for these things you morons. To bad I can't rate you lower. Screw you.<//Review>

This place delivery drivers are trash . What’s happening ups ? Is everybody just slacking cause of social network or people addicted to their phones not paying attention to your jobs ??  I was off expecting this package waited and waited even with the door open Jesus Christ around 8 pm recheck the websites tracking info and stated attempted delivery at 7:45 pm ! It was a lie big big lie I was home all day waiting for my package that never got here !! I had to waste my gas picking it up myself  . Also please note my neighbor it’s always getting deliveries well out of 10 times 4 packages of his have been left inside my property and I had to deliver it myself to him, he mentioned if you were not a honest person you would of had lots of cool expensive toys lol anyways seriously ups is going down ☹️<//review>

I live close to UCR and have many orders to receive from UPS. Unfortunately this one here is the most awful one.
LAst year I ordered a 400$ phone from target shipped by UPS after staying at home for 2 days ( because they never knock the door ) I found the parcel in the garden in front of my house. Perfect delivery.

Dec 2016 I ordered a food processor for my girlfriend. She and I were at home for 2 days but every time what we got was a note reminder. I coordinated to pick it up from costumer service and they confirmed to keep the parcel to pick up but when I got the they had no idea where the parcel was.
And a day after when I was home all the evening they left the third note that you where not home. I can not believe it  they left a note for a  lost parcel and when the main door was open and I was busy just a few feet away with my laptop.

To night I was expecting them with another parcel and base on last experience left a note on main door that " UPS I'm home just knock the door " and at last I faced another note that we came and you were not home. Know have to run after the parcel before they loose it again .........</Text>

<Text>Horrible customer service.
Was supposed  to get and item delivered on a Tuesday it stated no one was there to sign. But no signature was required. Wednesday, item out for delivery then updates and states they cannot find the house because address was wrong. Called to see what address they had it was correct. There excuse was it is a new driver and you will get your package some time the next day. ABSOLUTELY  HORRIBLE  CUSTOMER SERVICE.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I like the appointment system. But that's about it.   Way too much $ for even a good haircut, which I did not get.   I told the barber what I wanted, what I always ask for.  He told me, "no we can't do that because your hair will be too short."   🤡🤷‍♂️  I explained again exactly how I wanted it.  He told me he'd cut it his way and we could always cut more.   35 minutes later and he showed me the cut, way too long, and I asked him a third time to cut shorter.   He cut a little more and sent me on my way bc the time was up, 45 minutes. Still too long.   Way over priced, $40 before tip.  Lame NY subway atmosphere.  You're paying for the rent and damn subway tile, not the talent.  No names, in hopes they've improved.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This place gives the best haircuts and the guys there are some of the best people I know. They're courteous, caring, and quick! Every time I stop at Empire I know I'm going to look my best. Usually, I'll give a general idea of the look I'm going for, and I'm always amazed at the artistry. If you need a dope fade, this is the spot!</Text>

The only place we will go for both my husband and my 1 year old! My husband has had 3 different barbers cut his hair here and they all did a PERFECT job!

They will be going to Kevin regularly... he was extremely patient (& is a natural with kids- always trying to make him laugh and keep him happy) with my 1 year old both times he got it cut and he took his time to make sure it was perfect!! I honestly have no clue how he made my baby's hair look so good with how much my little man moved around. Very reasonable price for top notch kids hair cuts, so if your little one is extra difficult, make sure to tip him well!!! My husband's hair turns out perfectly every time, it is worth the extra money (over a super cuts) ANY day. I couldn't be any happier with this place & the job Kevin did!!!

Just a heads up, they do take walk ins but it's a long wait.... they have this great app that tells you where you're at in line and they call your cell phone when they're ready for you. It is TOTALLY worth the wait! You can always schedule an appointment as well, but our schedule is a little hectic so we usually just go in to get "in line" and do some shopping & lunch til it's our turn!<//Text>

Little bit of a wait time (unless you make an appointment) but it is totally worth it. When you are getting your hair cut they take there time and focus on you. Once again I would recommend to anyone and they are definitely worth it.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I've been searching for a barber for many years. By accident, I found Empire Barbershop. I never expected to find a barber in a mall. The shop is well decorated with seating for waiting guests. I opted to leave my name and phone number to be contacted when it was my turn. I was able to see my place in line when they texted me a link. There were 24 people ahead of me with a wait time of 2.5 hours. I went to run errands and the text came at almost the 2.5 hour mark. I was lucky enough to get Aaron. He was polite and professional. Without a doubt, he gave me the best haircut and shave I have ever had. Went to work the following Monday and got so many compliments I lost count. I look forward to returning every 4 to 6 weeks.</text>< Pictures>

There was a fire in my back yard, that I had to attend too. But I got charged full price for missing my appointment.
I loved my first experience there, they did exactly what I wanted, but now this is a bit ridiculous because this is/was more important. I still would like to continue coming here but if they’re not understanding about something like a fire in the back yard, then that’s a bit disappointing.< /Review>

< review>
My experiences started great; however, I tried three times in one week to get seated but they wouldn’t accommodate me after being told they had to close early one day, came back the next day and waited over two hours and never called to say they had a spot, the next day I tried booking an appointment like the guy that helped me said to, but their website says a barber is available but says cannot seat me for another two weeks when next available appointment says in three hours. Great service but I guess they cannot make exceptions to accommodate those that tried to give them business but they didn’t want to work with.< /review>
<pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1513379813614, 'text': 'Hello Dave, we accept walkins daily. We are open 9am-9pm we only close Christmas and Easter. The day you mentioned we did close early as the sign in front of the shop indicated for a community charity event with the San Francisco 49ers where we reached over 1500 people from displaced homes. Yes the shop is extremely busy and the barbers book out 1-2 weeks in advance. The booking system works on time frames according to service. Meaning if there is a 30 min slot and the service time doesn’t match it will not allow you to book to prevent the barber from being backed out and disrupting appointment times which I’m sure you can appreciate as we do our best to be on time for our scheduled appointments. We appreciate all of our customers and certainly do our best to accommodate everyone. Thank you for your feedback and you can always call in or ask to speak with a manager to address any concerns.

This is an amazing feature, but not the only reason I now bring my son to Empire. My 9 year old sits in Stephen's chair and not only does he leave w/a fantastic cut he leaves w/an experience that only an amazing barber can provide. Stephen knows his stuff. He takes his time and explains the different cuts to his clients even when they are 9, but he is also the kind of person I want making a connection to my son.  Stephen is someone you will enjoy getting to know which is part of the entire barbershop experience.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Empire Barber Lounge has been my go to since they first opened (I can't remember if it was 2014 or 15..) but since then I've never received anything less than professional service, quality haircuts, and all around great vibes. I've visited many barbershops in the East Bay and Empire is my favorite by far. Everybody involved with them is extremely friendly and accommodating, would strongly recommend to anybody looking for a sweet haircut.<//Review>

The whole crew is very genuine and respectful, i always get greeted the moment I walk in. I definitely enjoy the atmosphere, the crew and the music, it’s always busy but it’s always a good time. Drew, Justin, Rick, and the rest of the crew have always looked out for me and my friends, especially Jeff, who’s been my barber for the past couple years. They’re great people to get to know and it’s always a treat getting that kind of service, and especially walking out confident and exceptionally satisfied with my haircut. I Highly recommend them!<//Review>< Pictures>

The barbers cant even finish balding out a taper.  I asked for a mid bald taper. There was no blurry transition and my lineup wasn't crispy.<//Text>

Walked in and was greeted by a guy that took my name down and said they would send me text once they are ready. The wait is a bit long ( so better do it on your day off ) but it makes up for the cleanliness and professionalism at the shop. My barbers names was Hassan, he seemed like a cool dude. I told him what i was looking for and he gave me an excellent cut. His attention to detail was 10/10 and even my mom noticed and liked my new cut  lol. Will be going to see the same Barber again< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Professional,  clean and they know what they're doing.

So here is my story.  Went to a barber in Walnut creek to get my beard lined up with a bald fade.  The people are nice but my barber did me dirty.

Called up Empire and told them I needed some help.  My man Arnel cleaned me, knew exactly how to handle a beard.

Found my new spot and I highly recommend coming here.

As a bonus they take debit!!

Keep up the good work guys !</text>< pics>

<text>I been getting cut at Empire since they opened. I have always had a phenomenal experience with these guys! Great crew, products and the cuts I'd say, are some of the best in the Bay. My barber is Jeff. Bar the hell out your fade. Fades by Jeff last longer. Facts. But none the less, Jeff has helped me along the way with changing hair cuts, styles and products as well as advise with hair and skin care. He's really knowledgeable. The only thing that tops his knowledge of the game is the HAIRCUTS he pumps out! BARS!!!  Download the empire app and schedule your appointment with Jeff ASAP!!< /text>< Pictures>

These guys are the best, who ever you choose they all do a great job, shopping around all the while having to wait for your hair to grow out just to try another barber is very tedious, I'm so glad to have found this place, there is a wait, but it's worth it, any place that has a waiting list usually is.</Text>

First time in my life to experience a BIG cut on my face and small one on the other side. STEPHEN is the barber! He didn’t even apologize. Never again with Empire! He’s not even a professional one. A barber is like an artist when I asked him if he has suggestions on good haircut and he said, “You have to tell me what you want, it’s really what you want!” A silence for like a minute because he doesn’t want to suggest anything. I wanted to leave that time but I really needed a haircut and I waited for 3.5 hours, I didn’t mind the wait time though. I like the place but sorry NO MORE Empire. To all customers, don’t pick STEPHEN!<//Text>

{'time': 1510072432411, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback. We understand how this may have been a bit confusing. We close at 9pm however we typically take our last clients one hour prior as most services range betweeen 30-45 min. If there is an excess of clients waiting at times we must stop taking any more so we can accommodate all who are on our guest list before closing mall hours. Same day appointments are usually never available as the barbers usually book at least a week in advance. Thanks again for your feedback. Hope this info helps. Again sorry for the mixup but hope you’ll allow us to make it up.'}</response>
<Name>Adr Gza (Adrian)< /Name><rate>1<//rate><text>Called at 645pm to ask if an appointment was needed. I was told I could make one online howeverto walk-in because of the time. I arrive at 7:15pm and im told they are no longer taking walk-ins even though business hours are technically until 8pm. They should be advertising they close at 8pm when in fact they don't. The public cares more about actual business hours that are open for business not the time your shift it's over. It's not fare to the customer driving out of their way for a hair cut or anyone that you stop taking customers before the posted closing time just so you can walk out the door by 8pm.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have been coming here for about 2 years now, they show exceptional professionalism when you come in. Everyone in Empire are great to be around and always good experience to talk with everyone. I get my haircut by Stephen Guillen and he does a great job everytime and he's always flexible with his schedule,which makes it easier on me especially when the barborshop gets busy.</Text>

<Text>Good food but a little pricey. Had the "power chicken" healthy salad, which tasted pretty good. The salad +chicken and a soft drink came out to $25 even - ouch. It took me a bit to figure out how to get service at first - you have to push the button on this little doohickey on the table (and I think it zaps the waitress on the wrist, seriously). I really liked the call button approach, I hope other places pick up on the idea (keeps you from looking like a dork trying to flag down a waitress). Anyhow, service was good and food came out fast, which is important in the airport. Overall s'okay.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Should be a 0 star. This is my time reviewing. That should tell you something. I just stopped by on my way out of SD. It is a bummer that this is my only way to tell my story. Talked to the manager but he did not really care. Wanted to go to Stone. It was full so I settled.

I will keep this short. The service was horrible. Ordered a salad. Didn’t come. After almost an hour I asked when it was coming. The bartender forgot to put in my order. The “Chicken Cesar Salad” came without chicken. I asked if it came with chicken and he hold me it would have been extra. The menu says the salad comes with chicken.

Again, bummer that people will not see this because who looks at reviews before choosing a airport restaurant. This is more for the management anyway. Please reach out if you care enough to address the issue. I was an executive in the hospitality industry for a national brand and would love to connect with someone about my experience.</Review>< pics>

I have been to this PGA TOUR Grill several times, and I don't think I will ever go back again. I want to like this place, but the restaurant is not being managed well. The seats and tables are dirty, the food is hit-or-miss, and adult drinks are over priced.

The final straw was: I bought two Double-Shot margaritas for my wife and I, and there wasn't any alcohol, so I paid $32 for sugar water.

If you get a margarita, have them bring you the shot on the side, so you can verify there is anything in it. I will remind you, I paid for double-shot margaritas for $32, and got a virgin margarita.

Never again.  I would not recommend this place.</text>

Very RUDE bartender!!! We had been waiting over 6 hours for our flight. We decided to go in across from our gate to grab a drink. My boyfriend accidentally ordered me a Budweiser when I wanted a margarita.  I told the bartender this and he said he wasn't allowed to give me 2 drinks at a time and had to finish the Budweiser.  So I did and the whole time he was staring at me. Then I ordered my margarita and he said "you look tired so I don't think I will serve you anything else, I don't feel safe serving you ".  I have never heard this excuse and I used to be a bartender.  I'm not driving,  wasn't drunk,  what in the hell is wrong with this bartender!!!!<//Text>

They are severely understaffed, and poorly managed. Incredibly rude bartender refused to help me find my server after I told him my plane was about to board, he talked down to me and called me “baby”. Manager treated me like I was the bad guy and told me he would “keep an eye on it”, yeah okay buddy. The behavior from the bartender was completely unnecessary and disgusting, should not have been tolerated at all. Our server was very kind but over worked and all the other servers were in a bad mood. The food was okay but everything was very slow took us probably 15 minutes to get water and to be greeted. Wish we would’ve gone somewhere else. There is a reason why they are the emptiest restaurant there, they suck! This place should be closed.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The menu on the website is outdated as I was checking it out before stopping by.

Update 9/21
Granted again 11 dollars for a beer to me is crazy but again I'll add that it's not packed like the other places and they have outlets under the bar to charge your phone which was a huge plus to me< /Review><response>None<//response><rating>4< /rating>< pics>

<review>Decent food. Nothing special but when you need something to eat besides those sandwiches sitting in the window for God knows how long, this was a decent place to eat. The burgers were plain, no flavor beyond the norm.

Wouldn't eat at again but only because nothing stood out here and there are other places to enjoy.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The RUDEST bartender I have ever seen! They have the golf name and "good Ole boy" attitude. Overpriced and underwhelming place that tried to open a restaurant in an airport, only they don't want travelers there. My girlfriend was cut off after 1 beer because "she looked sleepy". This was after the bartender wanna be stared at us constantly. Don't go there!<//Review>

<review>Super rude servers and bartender. We just wanted a single drink. Got passed over by the servers for 15 minutes, then went to the bar to get our order in only to be passed up for 5 minutes and told to "take a seat and he'll be with us in a minute or 5," as he took orders from people around us. We fly out of San Diego a lot and Stone was busy, so we gave this place a shot. Never ever ever again.<//review>< Pictures>

Thanks to Global Entry I don't have to deal with long, annoying customs lines when returning to the US after international travels. This gave us some time for a beer on the layover between Los Cabos, Mexico and SFO. Arturo was the bartender and he was fast and friendly - perfect airport service!

Hermie was a GREAT bartender/server and food was pretty good.
I would like to give some feedback on ginger beer. Goslings is cheap, high-fructose corn syrup trash with "ginger beer flavoring". The Kraken black molasses was ok but not really a traditional ginger beer so I don't think that is a good solution either. For such a nice restaurant, you should spend a little more and get a higher quality ginger beer with real sugar and real ginger.< /review>

I have eaten there before and it was fine. Today, 1/16 at 3:30 my wife went there to est before our flight. Worst service or lack there of ever. Two waitresses were there , we had to go talk to them to ask anout being seated, even though they saw us walk in. They we tslking to each other mot waiting on customers. We seated our selves and we sat at a booth for 3-5 minutes while they now chated at the register, looking at us. Never acknowledged us to say I’ll be right with you or anything. Body language totally indicated they were notinterested in us as customers. So after being ignored we left and walked across to Stone Brewing Co. and were promptly waited on. There were hardly any customers at PGA. Never going there again. I fly into SAN and out of SAN 5/6 times a year. Go some where you will be greeted and appreciated. Lazy, lazy employees at PGA.<//Review>

I ordered a salad and I literally got a head of lettuce, a small slice of garlic bread, and chicken, all separate. I asked for something else instead and it took 30 minutes for it to get to my table. Needless to say, service was not pleasant.< /Text>

My wife and I went to several nurseries and growers and decided on Moon Nurseries.  They had the widest selection and most knowledgeable staff.  We were incredibly happy with our salesperson Chris Bowden.  His help and expertise and communication on our choices really shaped our final decision to move forward and purchase half a dozen trees.  That kind of financial commitment is easier to digest when you know you're dealing with a team of professionals.  We're incredibly happy and have referred friends and neighbors to Chris and Moon Nurseries.< /review>

< Review>
Had a previously planted strawberry tree that did not do well.  Chris Bowden was very helpful with selecting a larger size tree, which he said tended to do better.  He also offered me some credit on the new tree, which definitely helped out with the cost.  Patrick and his crew did the planting.  So far, the tree is looking great.  I recommend Moon Valley for their selection and excellent service.  Thanks!<//Review>

The Moon Valley Nursery staff  and management were patiently resourceful  in helping us pick the type of tree we liked for our backyard based on our criteria and space constraints. The delivery and planting was done very smoothly. The showed up on time and planted the tree and performed initial conditioning of the soil. They were very professional and courteous and cleaned up their debris after they completed their job.</review>

Last week we used Moon Valley Nurseries again to plant a row of mature hedges. I absolutely can't say enough about these people and their products. Chis Bowden is just the best and chose the perfect hedge for my backyard . Their crew headed by Mr. Cruz Zavala were outstanding.  There is no obstacle too difficult for them to deal with. No need to go else where, you won't be disappointed .<//Review>

Not HAPPY at all! My father (88) yrs. old purchased 27 trees from this nursery, tho, the people were very nice,  the job was a complete flop! Not only was my dads estimate WRONG of how many trees that were needed to cover his fence line. There is a 10’ uncovered trench left opened, the measurements were wrong. Also, CRUZ, gave my father an outrageous bill of $4300.00, to finish digging the trench. It only took 3 hours & to fall a small tree and have the root dug up. The tree was removed but, the stump and root were NEVER REMOVED. I feel my Father was severely taken advantage of because of his age!<//Review>

A huge selection of quality healthy shrubs and trees. BUT, it can become quite EXPENSIVE. Not bad if you bring your own plants home and plant them. However there is a $75 planting fee per shrub and $200 just to come out. So I spent $500 to plant 4 shrubs that cost me less than $100 dollars each. ALMOST $900 for 4 shrubs! YIKES!</review>

<text>I visited Moon Valley Nurseries today just to take a walk. Fortunately, they were fine with that. If you don't mind the freeway noise (think of it as a rushing river😉), it's a nice place for a walk. You might just see a dinosaur, a bull, a horse , a giraffe or an elephant.</text>< pictures>

My wife and I are very please with the service we received. Chris Bowden did a super job helping us pick out our trees and plants for our tropical themed backyard. Cruz and his team that did the planting were very pleasant and efficient and they were in and out in no time at all. I highly recommend them.</Text>

<text>I am very happy with my purchase and overall experience at MVN. I wanted shrubs in large planters and Mr.Bowden helped me select a quality evergreen that would look amazing in a beautiful planter. The planting team led by Mr. Zavala made sure everything was done right. I feel like I have purchased a piece of art that lives and breathes. I am on my way to creating my backyard oasis!< /text></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I wanted a large tree in a pot for the front of our house in Dana Point CA. We went to Moon Valley Nursery in Irvine.  We were masked and gloved and so were they. Joe Reyna helped us pick out a very nice Palo Verde tree and a pot to match.  Joe was very helpful and professional and easy to work with. He made suggestions that were useful. Mike and his crew delivered and planted the tree.  He helped us rotate some other 12 foot tall privacy trees that we purchased from Moon Valley about 10 years ago. They were also in pots and one side was against a wall. We rotate them once a year so they grow evenly. We were happy with Moon Valley 10 years ago and that is why we went back. Again we are completely satisfied and recommend them. They have the largest selection of trees I have ever seen. We also purchased some other plants and another pot. The tree is just beginning to show leaves and will have small yellow flowers soon.< /Text>

<user>107735331073515011152</user><text>Went to Moon Valley to buy a whole slew of trees/plants for our backyard. Lacey helped us find trees for our project - she did a great job finding trees I was specifically looking for (even looking at other Moon Valley locations) and showing me trees I hadn't thought of. She was very patient and never rushed us, even though we wanted to see a lot. I made some changes to the order before the delivery day and she was always accommodating and quick to respond (really quick!).

Delivery and planting day went well. Brandon, Juan, Alex and Manuel were all pros. They planted about 30 trees and plants and were excellent about consulting with me about placement and right before trees went into the ground (to choose best face) - trees were all straight and placed in exactly the right spots. There was no question that they knew exactly what they were doing.

My only advice if you're ordering a lot of plants is to choose/approve EVERY plant before delivery day - there were a few plants that were much too small for their price/container size, which we cancelled - but it was all taken care of with no problem. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again - especially trees.</text><gmapID>0x80dcdd708cddbaf7:0x7904e131dedf4296<//gmapID><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

< Review>
We ordered quite a few trees, bushes and plants from Moon Valley Nurseries with the help of our nursery specialist Tim Rael.  Tim was very instrumental in design, placing and suggestions for a symmetrical look that we had envisioned.  The process of self-choosing the trees and larger plants was very gratifying to know we chose the exact tree or plant ourselves.  The team that came to plant all of our items were very professional, polite and truly passionate about the job they were doing.  They went the extra mile to assure our comfort on placement of the trees/plants even though it was all laid out by Tim the previous day.  We had a couple of issues that were resolved professionally with no disruption to their planting.  The team: Christopher Gill, Michael Towne, Jorge Ulloa and Douglas Moran knew their job and how to assure at the end of the day we were happy with all of the plantings.  This team worked in unison and other than all of beautiful new trees/plants in the yard you would have not known they were there.  They clean up and left our yard looking beautiful.  Highly recommend this company for your landscape needs!!
Our order (we had a very large order) had a couple of items that were not available at time of original planting schedule, our sales person (Tim Rael) and scheduling guy (Chad) kept us in the loop on when the items would be delivered/planted.  The team: Mike Falco and his team member knew their job and how to assure at the end of the day we were happy with all of the plantings. This experience was very refreshing from time of sale to the complete planting.  Highly recommend this company for your landscape needs!!< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My family and I highly recommend Moon Valley Nursery.  Chris was able to make our tropical dream landscaping come true.
We had never been to Moon Valley Nursery before.  When we arrived we were greeted by Chris who is super friendly and personable.  We went into the office briefly to explain what we were wanting to accomplish in our backyard.  Chris immediately understood the vibe we were wanting to achieve.
He took us around the nursery to see the specific plants he had in mind.  The nursery is beautiful and there are so many options.
After selecting the plants, we went back to the office and Chris put together a plan to show us where the plants should be planted and why.
The delivery was scheduled for the following week.
We were notified the day before delivery was scheduled.
The delivery team was amazing.  Mike was the foreman of our job.  He was very patient and explaining everything.  His team was very professional and did a thorough job.
I’m writing this review as I’m swimming in my pool surrounded by beautiful landscaping
Thank you Moon Valley Nursery!!<//Text>< pictures>

I needed some help and advice, and Lacey was there all the way from start to finish. We found exactly what was needed for our back yard. The entire staff here is super knowledgeable and friendly. They also have everything you could ever want in your yard. While planting, they accidentally broke one of my sprinklers. Ryan was out the next day to fix it at no charge. I can honestly say this was the greatest experience I've ever had in a nursery thus far. I'm now a customer for life.<//Review>< Pics>

I pretty much went unnoticed.  I had intended on purchasing two outdoor planters and a clinging vine. I was not impressed with the planter selection.  I would have purchased a clinging vine, but had questions btwn two and never saw anyone to help. Didn't even know where I would go to purchase one had I made up my mind anyway...<//review>

I had Mike Falco and his crew Wifredo, Cruz, and Emerson come and plant a replacement avocado tree in my backyard. Everyone was professional,  polite and extremely knowledgeable. They were in and out in just a few minutes after answering my many annoying questions. Thanks guys, I cant wait for our next project!<//Text>

<username>Jeremy Schwartz</username><review>These guys are brutal to work with when things aren't going smoothly.  My high-pressure rep got me to purchase trees before I got HOA approval, telling me no problem if my HOA objects. Turned out my HOA required a $1,000 review process for trees, so I didn't want to proceed in spending $1,000 to review a $1,600 tree purchase.

When I asked for a refund, I was told I could only actually get a refund with a 15% restocking fee, or if I was willing to spend $800 on other products I could get the remaining $800 refunded.

I went ahead and spent the $800 on some shrubs and moved on with my life. One week and three phone calls later, no refund. Another week and two phone calls later a manager Brandon finally called me back and tried to change the prices on the already installed shrubs, but then finally agreed to just "give me what I wanted" and refund the $800 as agreed. One week later, no refund.

General Manager Brian Bailey then sends an automated email asking for a review. I explain everything to him, he apologized that Brandon never got to my refund and promised to take care of. One week later again, no refund.

These guys have no interest in you once they've got your money. They'll say anything to sell you more and more stuff and don't care about you as a customer. This place is like a bad used car lot. Avoid at all costs. Now off to file a credit card dispute.</review><rate>1</rate></record>

These guys are really good salespeople but when it comes to standing up for their work product, installation, and delivery.

My Bamboo plants died within 3  weeks of installation. We tried to use our warranty and was told to wait and try to water and then to not water.

Customer service and delivery keep screwing up the details and wasting our time regarding replacing the plants. I made a complaint and was given the run aroud for sometime. But in the end they came through after hours of run arond.< /text>

Very happy. Moon Valley has a very good selection of trees and the staff is very knowledgeable. We purchased three trees even though they haven't been delivered yet. We went back today to see if we could switch one of the trees for a different type. The salespeople work on commission there. One salesperson spent an hour with us making that change today and taking us out and showing us trees even though he was not making any Commission. McKenna really went out of his way to help us even though he wasn't getting paid for it.</text>

We bought 2 pigmy palms paid good price for them. But when they delivered one of the Palm is not the one we picked.
They called me back after hearing complain and let me pick a different palm and replanted. That is awesome service. Now I know where to go when I need plants. Thanks<//Review>

Nothing bothers me more then to take the time to do something like this, but after spending a lot of money to be ready for about 7 trees and about $9000.00  I have to say they have lost all my trust. Besides one individual the staff there is for most part below par!!!!!!!!!  I was so excited and spent so much time with them for over 3 week period  to make sure their were no glitches and for them to call me the day before to tell me they can not deliver the trees was very unprofessional. I tried everything to make this happen over the phone and even drove over to see what we could do. I think they have become very large and have lost control of the business. Lastly, they are very expensive even to the trade as I am. I would try all other avenues before going down this road!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

< review>
I live right next to this garden in the Oak Creek community and I've been having very bad allergic reactions to some of the trees they've been planting behind our neighborhood. I did not have this problem prior to the business being established right next to the neighborhood I live in. Sorry I'm not rating this place's service or quality but location. I'm going to write a letter to the Irvine company regarding this issue.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>This place is awesome for items you will not find in a normal home improvement store (i.e. Home Depot, Lowes, Osh, etc). This place is more appropriate if you’re looking for special plants that you can’t get at a normal retail place (i.e. large/older trees, exotic type items, special regional specimens) or have major landscaping projects. They offer free professional planting for trees in boxes (this way it’s guaranteed your tree lives after planting).

This is a nursery and not a normal retail outlet, so don’t expect customer service personnel to be waiting at the doors when you arrive. Upon arriving, head into the sales office first to get an initial consultation and then someone will take you into the nursery for a tour and/or pick out plants. Don’t expect major discounts unless you’re buying in bulk or know a competitor has better pricing.<//text>< pics>

<Review>I went to Home Depot,  Lowes and a couple other nurseries in South Orange county - this place by far is 3 to 5 times more expensive… And I'm not kidding.  I've lived in Irvine for 10 years and I'm going to have to agree  with another person's comment that their prices are ridiculously too high...< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
Moon Valley Nurseries will take advantage of you, over charge you, over promise you and under deliver.  From the salesman to management once you sign your contract it’s all over. My wife and I met with Bill Norman from Moon Valley Nurseries in Irvine.  Bill said he needed to come to our house and see the landscaping project. A few days later he showed up and walked the site with me and we talked about the different options and he said they would prepare a plan and be in touch. When the plan was finished we drove to Moon Valley Nurseries went over the plan. I took the plan and submitted it to our HOA for approval. Once the plan was approved we notified Moon Valley Nurseries. Moon Valley Nurseries wanted to drive over to our home and pick up a check. Which should have been my first clue, but I had them come over anyhow and pick up a check for over $17,000. Which was payment for half of the landscaping job that was promised. The work was scheduled for June 15th so once again Moon Valley Nursery wanted to drive to my house to pick up another $17,000+ for the balance of the work before it even started.  On June 15th Moon Valley Nurseries with several guys showed up. On the surface things looked like they were going well, I even sent a text “Nice job so far we love it! There are still things missing are they coming back” but at the end of the day when the crews left I was concerned that many plants, shrubs and trees were missing. And, after walking around the job site I noticed that the soil had not been prepped, my drains had been covered up by 8 inches of dirt, and Moon Valley Nursery did not even take away any dirt from the job site.  After digging the holes for the trees and plants Moon Valley Nursery just piled the soil up against the tree trunks, drains, patio deck and wall caps. It was quickly a mess when the sprinklers went on, we had mud everywhere. I noticed the plants had been planted in holes with no grading in the slightest fashion.  I had to hire another contractor to come fix the mess Moon Valley Nurseries had created. I quickly became concerned that I got scammed into paying $33,000 for a landscaping job that only bought me at most $10,000 worth of plants and trees and a few hole diggers.  I texted Moon Valley Nurseries on Thursday June 15, 2017 and asked about my missing landscape. Moon Valley Nurseries salesman Bill Norman said he would be on site the entire time however, he left early and never knew that I was missing landscaping. Moon Valley Nurseries salesman Bill Norman texted me that same evening stating that he would check with Moon Valley when he got back to the office on Saturday the 17th. I never heard from Moon Valley on the morning of the 17th so I texted again at 1:07 on the 17th asking when are you coming back to finish? Still no answer, so I texted again at 2:50 still no response.  Finally, I get a response from Moon Valley Nursery that they will be back out Thursday or Friday the 22nd or 23rd. When no one showed up on the 22nd I sent another text asking what’s going on? I received, however, no response. So, once again on the 26th I sent another text upset that no one from Moon Valley Nursery showed up or even bothered to call me.  Finally, on the 27th I received a message that they would be out on the 29th.  After Moon Valley Nurseries left my property on June 29th I was still missing plants, scrubs and a tree.  I contacted the management of Moon Valley Nurseries and received nothing but attitude from the first manager. Here I am the customer whom had paid $33,000 for landscaping that I did not get, as of this posting July 7, 2017 I still have not received all my plants and trees. Once Moon Valley Nursery took my money it was all downhill from there.  Today I had one of the owners out to my property where he admitted that plants, shrubs and a tree were still missing.  I was over charged, I was lied to, they misrepresented what they were going to do and the work they did, I would have been better off hiring my gardener to do the same quality work for 25% of the cost.<//Review>

When they brought the trees they didn't dig the holes wide enough and our landscaper says they jumped up and down on the root balls to cram them in the ground. Of the seven trees we bought from them on one is alive. I have had to replace all the others.</review>

We had (18) Podocarpus Fern Pines, (4) Indian Hawthornes and (1)Redbud Forest Pansy Tree planted and they all look great!  Thanks to our designer Christopher and the planting crews guided by Cruz and Mike the whole process from selection to install went very well.  We highly recommend Moon Valley Nurseries !!!<//Text>

<review>I'd give this place 10 starts if I could!  We stopped by the bakery for the first time this week and all I can say is that their food is authentic Lebanese-Syrian, but also very delicious.  Everything we ordered tasted amazing and the staff was super friendly.  We'll definitely be going back regularly and I would encourage everyone to give this place a try.  There's something for everyone.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Amazing bakery with wonderful staff. The Knafeh is one of the best I’ve had, I also definitely suggest the namoura. Highly recommend this place to anyone you wants authentic Middle Eastern baked goods and food.</Text>< pictures>

Lovely hidden gem in Burbank making incredible Lebanese pastries and breakfast. The Z Factory special, Zaatar bread topped with egg, tomato, black olives and mint was super flavorful. The woman behind the counter was super friendly and even brought us a few extra sweets to try. Will definitely be back!<//Text>

<Review>My husband and I found this place on google search after driving 17 hrs from seattle and prior to checking into our hotel in Burbank
Service was amazing.   They gave us complimentary pastries, and Armenian coffee.
The lady manages the place Made us feel so welcomed and showed us great hospitality

Food tasted great, portions are good and well priced

We highly recommend their breakfast sujuk and cheese kachapuri<//Review>< UserId.>

<text>AMAZING. I can't believe I lived here 5.5 years and never knew I was 5 minutes from this place. I got the 2 egg and cheese khachapuri, spicy cheese burek, & soujouk and cheese specialty burek. Insane. I asked for the eggs to be runny because I needed it to-go, and it was cooked so perfectly that by the time I got home, my khachapuri was BEAUTIFUL. The 3 items I got were so big that they lasted me 5 meals! I wish I had taken a photo of the soujouk burek. It had so much cheese and meat in it, just a perfect middle eastern "calzone."

Khachapuri and other items are made fresh. Hence, yes, you have to wait if you're going to order them, 15-20 minutes. They have ready-to-eat items like the burek, stuffed grape leaves, etc., if you're in a rush. However, take my advice and wait for the fresh stuff. I could eat here every day.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Then the staff saw us getting mad at their carelessness and how slow they are so we left and they still didn't even ask what was wrong or even care that we left. He was arguing with a customer how fresh they serve the food while she was calling them slow. Sir, you need to learn how to he fast and serve fresh food at the same time.

Try the mini size of zaatar bread and the one with half zaatar and half cheese is so good.
I have visited this place few times recently and the owner Fadi he was so kind and has great customer service skills, that made me go out of my way and write this review.
The eclair that I tried there was not the best out there but the rest of the pastries are good.< /review>

Everyone that I've had the pleasure of dealing with here has been incredibly knowledgeable and seems to be willing to go to any lengths to assist the customer. the instruments here are also beautiful and make me wish I could play all of them. Which reminds me it seems like they offer lessons too! Hmm...

And of course each time I've been in there Beethoven is playing in the background, most recently the 6th symphony. Keep up the great work!<//Text></record>

<Text>Before I ran to the reviews to post a negative review, I decided to give Bertrand's a call to see if I was missing something.  Basically, what was originally a miscommunication turned out be corrected by Bertrand's.  I am so glad that we went with this company out of the 3 that were recommended.  My problem was resolved quickly and without my blood pressure going through the roof.  I have full confidence that we are with an honest company with excellent customer service as their main concern.  Thank you for treating us like valued customers.  If my daughter plans to stick with Violin, we definitely will be purchasing our first violin from Bertrand's.  Thank you!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1568754245794, 'text': "Coffi,  Thank you for choosing Bertrand's for your musical needs.

I teach piano and voice privately and this is my go to music store. Good selection, especially if you teach Junior Music Festival or Certificate of Merit piano students. If they don't have something in stock, they get it right away and call when it comes in. Also, teachers get a discount. Can't beat it.</text>

The Place to get sheet music for any instruments! Because the knowledgeable and friendly staffs so if I am on the way, I don't mind stop by to pick up some lesson books for my students. Even though I can order most of the music online, I still enjoy coming in here and get lost in the music :)< /review>

As a music teacher, OTM is the absolute best. Pasadena is soooo lucky to have a store of this caliber in our community. Even if you're not directly in Pasadena, it's worth the drive to buy everything you need and browse through all the beautiful (Henle!) editions. The store has almost every book imaginable that you would ever need, both as a teacher and as a student. Many of my students opt to shop here instead of ordering online because of the store experience. Knowledgeable people work there, helping with instrumental rentals and book purchases. The owner was a Suzuki piano teacher professionally for many years, and is an absolute joy to communicate with all things music. Cheers :)< /review>

Once I got to my office and unwrapped it imagine my surprise when I saw a half eaten sandwich neatly wrapped and placed in my bag.  Not only is this unacceptable behavior but is completely unsanitary and a piss poor reflection of the employees which thereby reflect on the corporation.  To make matters worse trying to give feedback on their site only results in multiple crashes due to a poorly developed script and the inability to even leave any feedback at all.   Trying to use the phone number provided above is also absolutely useless.  As a corporation you really need to take a step back and figure out how to improve not only your customer relations but also your profile as a whole.<//text></record></dataset><record>

It was a very bad and negative experiece.
This Jack in the Box was open for take out orders and no dining in.
We were inside for 5+ minutes while the cashier was on a personal call.
There was no backup and the cashier kept talking while we waited.
It got to the point where my friend had to yell out, "Can someone come and take our order?"
Finally someone came and she was none too happy as the cashier was still on the personal call.
She reluctantly took our order and filled it.
I don't think I'm going to return to this JITB anytime soon.
If I read a more positive posting after mine, I may reconsider.
There are more fishes in the sea who would appreciate my patronage.<//Text>

<Review>This spot is the one I like best. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this restaurant I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very affectionate and the cooking they place on your table is so flavorful. I would always prefer to have a good meal here. I recommend this place with pleasure.<//Review>< Date>

Unbelievable I get my order and not even half way through, I bite into a big piece of fat and veins. My appetite is ruined. Not to mention, They forgot to give me my soda, I had to go drive back there go in and grab my soda. I got the biggest attitude when I asked for Ranch, she looked and inspected my order on the screen, then hands me one Ranch, I said can I have one more Ranch please,  she rolls her eyes and hands me a 1 more Ranch. Very bad customer service.< /Review>

Went to the drive-thru on my way to work. Made it clear that I wanted no tomatoes and no onions on my burger. At the window when I paid, I asked her to make sure there were no onions, because the screen only said no tomatoes. When she gave me my food, I asked her if she made sure there were no onions. She had to ask a manager, and then they made me pull forward to the parking lot as they remade it. A quick stop turned into me being late for work because of their incompetence.<//Text>

The potato is not tasty and my children did not feel well after eating the sandwich.  I don't think they should put the ketchup sauce with the potatoes, as we always clean it before using it.< /text>

<review>This place will screw up your order and then not remake it. If you have allergies, stay well away from here because they do not care if you die.
Edit:
I did exactly as the response suggested on that same night (I even included the order number from the receipt, which had the 'NO X' part of my order listed on it). I've received no contact from either the store or the company. I guess they really don't care if they're handing you something you told them to leave off. Good to know that this store is perfectly representative of the chain as a whole. I haven't been to a Jack in the Box since, and I know to keep it that way.</review>< rate>

Their teriyaki rice bowl is amazing. The texture of the rice, the broccoli, the chicken, it's all great! Whatever teriyaki sauce they put in those little packets is incredible.</Text>

Ugh... we went here late when there were several employees not busy. An incoherent employee with speech slurred badly enough that we expected them to need an ambulance took our order incorrectly several times. Preparing our order took long enough that they had us pull into the parking lot to wait. The employee who brought our food was the best part of the experience. The food was Chewy (as if it had been reheated several times)tasteless and cold. Like literally has a chill on it. I  know better than to expect top quality food or service at a fast food place. But seriously if I am going to wait for that long I at least expect more than pulling stale cold food from the shelf.<//text>

The service was very slow....went to order inside the store and only one customer was ahead of me. The order was one of those promotional boxes that are advertising at $6.00 each. Well, the very first thing that went wrong was that the cashier told me that the price on any of the boxes in the promotional picture was of $8.00 not $6.00.
She then took the order because I accepted the new price.
10 minutes after the order was not ready yet. So, I went to the front and I asked for my food. She stated that was not ready yet. I asked to put the box to go since I had a sudden call for work.
I definitely will not be back to this particular store in a short time term. I want to see if things change around in few weeks.
Good luck getting prompt (fast) service at this location.<//text>

<review>This location is a slack shop. Why are you guys selling a number one that says it has Swiss cheese, demonstrated by the photo on the display, but when you order it the employees claim you guys have never had that cheese? That’s a bait and switch, and unprofessional. Why is this the only location that makes this claim? On top of that they charged me an upcharge for the “real swiss cheese”, only to then tell me that the cheese doesn’t exist. So why did you charge me for it, and why is it an option on your register to be charged? Man this makes no sense, and the lady tried to belittle me for requesting a refund for the up-charge amount for the cheese. Very poor run location, very poor customer service, and the product being sold doesn’t match the quality I’ve come to expect from other local Jack in the Box restaurants. Training and retraining needs more emphasis..</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1568043943258, 'text': "This is definitely not the impression we want to leave, Jeffrey.

Lady at the window handed me my food and told her my teriyaki chicken was missing she said it's in the bag which clearly it wasn't.  When I got home one of my orders was still missing!<//text>

<Text>Came here at around 8pm and was very unpleased to watch an employee blow her nose and even rubbing it with her hands WITHOUT washing her hands while handling my order. Very disgusting.

Conveniently situated right by the freeway on the way to the Bay, so it's the ideal location to stop for a quick bite when hungry.  Stopped here for some food while heading to the airport.

The interior is clean, and the staff were speedy and polite with their service, so I'll be using this again whenever I need to grab some food on the way to the Bay Area!<//review>

I tried to handle this quietly and privately but you make it so difficult to actually speak with someone this is going to have to be a very public display. As when I am thru here I plan to go on google, yelp and any other venue I find to rate the experience that I had at one of your places of business. I visit your location in Hercules, Ca. Sometimes three times a day for caramel iced coffee, for YEARS! I went thru the drive thru last sat. Ordered my coffee and rolled around to pay. I have the girl a 20.00 bill as I had just come from the ATM, which only gives what? 20’s! She handed me my coffee and then a dollar and some change. I said, man the price of coffee sure went up because I gave you a twenty. The girl smarted me off and said, no you didn’t, you gave me a five. I said no honey, I gave you a twenty. She proceeded to argue with me. I showed her my bank receipt and the four twenties I had left and said, yes, I gave you a twenty. She turned to someone else and in a sarcastic tone says, she says she gave me a twenty but she didn’t she gave me a five! So I said look at the tape or count the drawer, I’m not trying to cheat you after all I come in here probably twenty times a week or more! They were trying to get me away from the window, but that wasn’t my problem. So even tho I was in a hurry they forced me to come inside. The girl says give me your receipt, which I did and she says it says right here you paid with a five, but I didn’t. She put that in there, I paid with a twenty, count your drawer. Well it became heated. FINALLY they counted the drawer and guess what? They were over! She gave me my money but refused to give me back my receipt. So I can’t take your stupid survey bc you need the number off the receipt. I want a call from someone to make this right. I will never go back to that place and depending n what you do I may never go back to Jack In the box ever. Balls in your court.< /Review>

I had a very large ($75) order to pick up and the intercom at the drive-thru was broken. They took my order at the window and I drove around to the front waited just a couple of minutes and went inside to check on my order. They were almost finished already! Great staff here.< /Review>

This is by far the worst Jack In The Box I have ever been to, possibly the worst fast food restaurant I’ve been to as well.

The customer service is horrible, the employees attitudes are bad and they act like I’m bothering them by placing an order. I’m convinced that on more than one occasion they have messed up my order on purpose. One time I had to go in 3 times for them to get my order correct. I’ve contacted corporate twice but nothing has changed, if anything they’ve gotten worse. No one seems to care. I won’t even consider going through the drive thru after 8pm. I drive all the way to Pinole and make it home faster than I would if I had gone to Hercules and as a bonus my order is correct!< /text>

Horrible experience. Keep getting our order wrong over and over again. I asked them to fix my order and they rolled their eyes. Horrible service. Made my order clear and thorough and they still get it wrong. Never come to this jack in the box...save ur money and go to a different store...bad customer service.< /review>

<review>Inconsistent service here. Sometimes you get what you order, sometimes not. Our last dine-in experience here took 20 minutes to get our food even though there were less than five people inside. I tasted my son's pancakes and eggs... It tasted like a science experiment gone wrong. I won't make that mistake again.</review>< pics>

Horrible service today! I'm soo upset. The guy had the nerves to serve me some tacos that were sitting out God knows how long! Then my kids burgers were cold when I got them because they took so darn long putting my simple order together. Sad< /Text>

Worst Jack in the box ever! Clammed milkshake machine was broken as drinking a shake, Chicken tater melt had no chicken patty or cheese. Time before night crew sleeping. Always filthy. Now food poisoning. Never going there again! Should be no stars but that's not an option<//review>

Tuli!! is the coolest dude in the frontline. He makes sure you'll get the best even if is your worst day. I feel bad for yelling at the people cause of my order, and he step and explain and cool me down. Great service, but needs more people. I definitely coming back because of him. Great Job Tuli.!!< /Review>

I've been frequenting this restaurant for more than a decade and the quality and customer service has went way down. They close the restaurant an hour earlier than posted because they are "understaffed" and the "24 Hour" drive thru closes randomly too. Bathrooms are disgusting and almost every table is sticky for some reason.  This restaurant is inconvenient and unreliable. Also, you can find long strands of hair in your burgers.</Text>

They don't get orders correct very often. We use the drive up and maybe 1 in 5 times they get it it right. They leave items out of the bag that they charged for or they don't get the order correct and have to start over. Very few time has someone spoken proper english - hard to understand is an understatement!<//text>

This place is garbage. Very poor service. They constantly screw up on my order. Last time I ate there I ordered 3 egg rolls, an order of potato wedges and a pita w/ extra veggies, no meat, no cheese. Instead those idiots gave me two orders of wedges, a pita with cheese,  3 egg rolls and 4 tacos.</text>

I thought the food was okay. The burger dripped sauce all over my shirt, and the drive through was pretty slow considering the store was not busy.< /review>

Extreamly long waits. Sandwiches most of the time are not put together well. Sometimes the fries are stale and the soda watered down. Did I mentioned long waits....<//text>
