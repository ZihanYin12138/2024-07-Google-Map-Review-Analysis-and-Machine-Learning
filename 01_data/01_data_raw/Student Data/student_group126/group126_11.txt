Side dishes really suck! Some of them even slightly spoiled. This is the second time I tasted bad side dishes here.
Soups are OK.< /Text>

<Review>Love their 순대국밥!! ㅠ ㅁ ㅠ

It's rather hard to find such delicious and specialized place. The service could be more attentive, but I'm not complaining. Packing to-go is self service.< /Review>< Pics>

Sometimes it's the best, sometimes you just scratch your head a little at the flavor. Usually, it straight gets the job done. If you're casual to Korean food, this is a good place to dive into the pool. If you're hardcore, this place is probably steadfast in your outdoors eating rotation.< /text>

Decent tasty Korean fare. The blood sausages had an unusual chewy starchy filler additive. The prices vs. quantity made for good value. Banchans were delicious, without leaving a sweet additive aftertaste. Service was fair, could improve.</review>

The serving is okay but for us it seems like all the tastes in the different dishes we ordered is Bland.

<review>Honestly, tastes were a little bit different from what I expected but I still LOVE Spicy Blood Sausage Soup because its very hot spicy (I like spicy one a lot), tasty, addictive and works best for my hangover. lol :)   I also tried Pork Back Bone Casserole, that was very good for 2 people. Actually, its more than enough for qty for 2 people.   In addition, very clean and nice space and all staffs are very kind.  THANKS to ALL staffs.</review>< Rate>

<Text>We ended up working late and wanted to try something new in the area, so decided to give this place a shot. Between three people, we got the 'small/medium' casserole soup. I wish it had a bit more flavor and spice to it. There were plenty of veggies and internal organ parts, but lacked in flavored. For the blood sausage, I thought I would enjoy that more since I love pork blood in soup, but for me it was bland and the texture a little off putting.

If you're curious, I say give this place a shot! The restaurant itself if very clean and spacious.< /Text></record>

It's practically pork intestines stuffed with noodles or other stuffing. Definitely tasty. Their other dishes are also great and perhaps too authentic for non-Koreans to enjoy vernacularly.

My new fave Korean restaurant in Santa Clara!

I really wanted to try the spicy blood sausage soup and it was amazing. It was *really* spicy, but very flavorful. Towards the end, the blood sausage started disintegrating so there were bits of vermicelli and blood sausage in the soup. I didn't mind, because it was just easier to eat, lol.

The banchan spread is also pretty good. Their kimchi is very flavorful. I also tried some of the soondoobu broth and it was flavorful.<//Review>

<user_id>116788487476824512195<//user_id><rate>5</rate><review>The staff are so friendly and nice. Their side dishes are really good and my husband said their kimchi is the best he’s ever had in his life (even considering the ones he had in Korea). Their food is quite authentic so it’s great for native Koreans like us but not sure for people who are not used to Korean food.
One more thing I really like about this place is, it’s really neat and clean. I don’t understand why but I often see the cleanliness of korean restaurants out of korea is not very good. This restaurant is, however, as clean as the normal restaurants I can see in Seoul.<//review>< date>

If you want to experience the authentic Korean cuisine, this is the place. Mild or Spicy?< /Text>

Fave Korean spot in South Bay. Food is authentic (both the sausages & your typical Korean mains like kamjatang). Banchan side dishes are amazing too< /review>

<review>Don't bother coming to this place since they won't even seat you.
We came on Saturday around 1:30pm and half the tables were empty.
We stood at the entrance for about 15 minutes and the workers purposely avoided eye contact with us and refused to seat us.
We left after since it was clear that they did not want to serve us food.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808fb5f1188dddfd:0x2975c7f44ebead72<//Gmap_id><Rating>1</Rating>< response>

<Text>Love the soondaegook here and how you can customize with the salt/ pepper/ sauces/ kimchi/ onion/ chives to create your own flavor. They give you plenty of meat. Usually I ask for no rice but extra chives & kimchi for my custom soup... very delicious! Haven't tried anything else though. They specialize in soondae.</Text>< pictures>

Among the places I ate in the United States, the ones that taste the most similar to those in Korea...

I posted a medium sized hotpot about $50 (including tex)
But it might be different, so it was really bad money. Soondae seems to be surrounded by artificial sundae shells on the right side. And since I bought a lot of MSG, I ate it all the time, but I still haven't eaten the taste like Miwon. Please don't do this. Please remind me to eat and come back again.
What is this? Please check the contents when submitting. For reference, I went to this house once before Corona, but at that time, it was really fine, so I submitted it for some reason.

(Translated by Google) This house seems eopnun the castle today is what the restaurant is almost time to go to close the door once more I want to let fooled Sure enough, I ordered a contribution Kimchi also how to eat without feeling .... Thanks for making me wrong last year to my house There's a terrible story about the staff coming in again.

이집은 성의가 없눈것같아요 오늘은 식당이 거의 문을 닫은 시간에 가서 한번더 속아보자싶어 투고를 시켰는데 아니나 다를까 김치도 없고 느끼하게 어떻게 먹어라는 건지.... 작년에도 엉뚱한걸 만들어서 줘서 우리집까지 직원이 다시들고오는 기가먹힌 사연도 있구요 먹어보니 MSG  장난아님< /review>

(Translated by Google) Older people, Sundae Gukbap is a food of memories. I took time to regret this day. Is it worth 15? I want to go somewhere else.

Bad Service.   They left me hanging with a loaded truck.   My reservation was ignored and they denied me a fully reserved storage unit.
I would never refer them to anyone and I will never do business with this place ever ever again.<//Text>

<Text>I was having a trailer hitch installed. The guy who scheduled my appointment and was supposed to do the install was not at work the day he made the appointment so someone else did it. They told me it would be an hour. I waited for 2 and a half. If they would have been honest with the time frame I would have made sure I had a ride back to work. Now I lost out on hours because they wanted to under estimate the time it would take.

Not impressed at all.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I love these guys but they haven’t ever had enough help. I arrived an hour and a half early for an online pickup of a trailer, and waited the entire time to pick up something I’ve already paid for. There’s literally only one guy working, he’s awesome, but there’s 20 people in the lobby and no one is going anywhere soon.  Don’t come here on a Saturday morning!</review>

My Step mother rented a container trailer from this location however after picking up the container the gentlemen left witbout giving us the paper work. The gentlemen never informed us they were here they just took the box and left. Worst company ever. negative 5 stars would never recommend.<//review>

You can’t be serious. ZERO sense of urgency. 2 guys working on a Saturday morning. Actually, more like one and half. Beard guy tells story’s like he’s on the Joe Rogan podcast while 8-10 people are waiting in line for a half hour. First time here definitely the last. Why even make a reservation for a truck?</Review>

This place will violate their own contract. Do not rent a u-box from this place to store at your home as they will call 3 weeks before they are supposed to pick it up and make you empty it so they can pick it up early, when they want to. They are unprofessional and threatened an elderly woman that if she didn't get it emptied overnight they would take the box to their storage facility with all of her stuff in it, essentially threatening grand theft. They don't care about their customers and they have horrible customer service. I would give them zero stars and I will tell everyone for the rest of my life to avoid using uhaul. The general manager of this location should be fired, as well as the driver who picked up the boxes.<//text>

This Uhaul was not only able to help me out, but also did so with such amazing customer service. The people in this unit are phenomenal!<//Text>< pics>

<Time>1533183135139<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>U haul overall as a company throughout the years to me has been good, but not great.... I'd say about 3.5 - 4 stars.  But, with the horrific events of the Carr fire in Redding this last week, I am giving this location 5 stars.  They helped me get in and out with a tow dolly in no time last Sat, even with the fire still raging just a couple miles away.  I live about 15 miles away but there was a section of the fire headed my way so I picked up the tow dolly as a precaution for a classic car of mine, that way I had it ready if needed.  Luckily the fire never made it to my home and I was able to return it unused after 3 days.  Even though I had it 3 days, the guys there were nice enough to only charge me for 1 day since I never actually needed it.  With this act of kindness I will be sure to pay the money they saved me forward to the victims of this terrible tragedy.  Stay strong and vigilant Redding and neighboring areas.... we will recover.  God Bless.</Review>< Pictures>

I wish I could give half a star or zero stars lol, not a good start for a business review.

I moved from Arizona to Redding with my stuff in a U Haul trailer, unfortunately in July which was HOT (117 degrees). The place I was first told to take my trailer to was Direct Sales Furniture, you can go there to read my review of them if you want, they cussed me out simply for bringing my trailer to them which my official U Haul paperwork told me to do. I ended up at this U Haul location on Cypress which also didn't want it.
They told me to leave and take it somewhere else after corporate told me to take it here after Direct A**hole Sales told me to take it somewhere else.  When I finally talked to someone in the regional management of U Haul in that area they said to take go back in to put the rep on the phone (on my cell phone), who then proceeded to cuss out the U Haul corporate rep and throw my phone down on the counter and started helping someone else. Apparently the store employees are not on the same page as the corporate customer service folks. The in store people told me to take it somewhere else because they supposedly didn't have space for it while the reps on phone told me to take it to them (Cypress store) because the computer showed they DID have space for it. I almost decided to keep it or just dump it by the side of the road since nobody wanted it but I knew they would later say I stole the trailer and charge me for it.
I went back and forth, into the store, back out into my 117 degree hot truck. The store manager was totally disrespectful and walked out at some point and left his workers to handle the line of customers. I will grant them it was hot out and that would be very hard to deal with but figure it out, work out more frequent brakes, keep the ac blowing, keep drinking water when its hot out, don't cuss out your customers and refuse to do your job. Apparently their computers weren't working either, so ok does business stop? Get out a pen and paper and keep it going. I'm your customer and I'M hot too and I'm never coming back to this place because you made me sit in your hot a** parking lot for over an hour!
Finally an employee manned up and took my trailer and logged it so I could get on with my day with the peace of mind that I won't be charged a late fee or anything stupid.

The customer service rep told me I would get a partial refund for the trouble I went through not just with this U Haul location but also the Direct Sales fiasco. When I got a call from the regional manager he said there's no refund for me but "they are very sorry" yes I'm sure.

These guys are very rude and disrespectful, don't walk, run away from this business!<//Text>

<Review>Terrible service. Moved from Colorado to Redding. I called ahead twice to ensure we had a storage unit reserved. They assured me several times that I had one reserved, and even gave me the dimensions of it. When I got to Redding, there was no one in the building. After waiting forever, they said they were full and we were out of luck. They said we spoke to a call center who did not know what they were talking about. Horrible service.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>As always, this location is the absolute BEST! I needed to rent a trailer however, I was not aware my vehicle was not equipped to tow one! These guys explained everything to me, nicely, professionally and even though I didn't end up using my own vehicle, I was able to secure another one and still managed to rent the trailer same day! I like that they have a service to answer their phones so they can give their customers in store 100% attention! Thanks again, to the entire staff!< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

< Review>
Stood in the lobby for 6-10 minutes as someone in the back is working. Waiting for someone I said hello a few times with no response. Figured i would go back and see if could get some help. When i said hello i was rudely told hope your not saying hello to  me?! I guess he was way above the pay grade of providing service (never the case). I left and informed i will find what i need somewhere else.  Horrible! If I could give it less than a one star i would!<//Review>

We had a one-way rental from Eureka to Redding, with a guaranteed storage unit at Redding.  Upon arrival at the Redding U Haul facility, we were told that they did not have any storage units available.  We discussed the lack of units with U Haul Customer Service and were given a 3-day free extension of our rental equipment, including free mileage, so that we could obtain storage elsewhere.  After obtaining storage with another facility, we returned our equipment to the Redding location; we returned the equipment prior to the end of our free extension.  The following day, Redding U Haul, despite being told by U Haul Customer Service that we were NOT to be charged, attempted to charge our credit card.
We have now had to file criminal charges against personnel at the Redding U Haul for credit card fraud; we provided Redding PD with the U Haul Customer Service email, that authorized the free extension, and a statement from our credit card company of the attempted charges.  Redding PD informed us that the Redding U Haul has multiple complaints and pending criminal charges for credit card fraud.
Do not use this location!  If you must, use cash only!
We were lucky that our credit card company denied the additional charges by this facility and has now reversed the original charges from U Haul altogether.<//review>

Quick and easy. I wish they would display true prices somewhere on their big massive signs. I got a $20 truck and drove maybe 25 miles and it costs nearly $70 : ( not including the gas I had to put in it).
Other than misleading (psychological tricks) the people there are helpful and get you in a truck quickly even when it is last minute.< /Review>

I've visited this facility twice today and waited for 15-20 minutes each time without a single employee acknowledging me.  Both times I gave up because it was making me late for work obligations.  The previous time I visited this business it was the same experience.  I counted 5+ employees working while standing there, each acting like they had all day to do whatever they needed to do.  Absolutely absurd.  I've left a message for management to call me back, but with the service I've seen I'm not really expecting them to call.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x54d2925ac86012e3:0x143b574d4f9a1ca< /gmapID></record>

They told me to park my car out front. Said it would be fine I was renting one of their trucks. I am retired and a woman I didn't expect to come back to a smashed up car. Windows busted all my stuff inside stolen.  The worst is it was covered in blood and some other fluid, now my car is a bio hazard and completely defiled. NO ONE EVEN APOLOGIZED THESE GUYS ARE RUDE THEY JUST KEPT SAYING WE NEVER TELL ANYONE TO PARK OUT FRONT.  BUT THEY DID TELL ME TO.</Text>

I have used this U Haul site twice now and both times could not have gone better. The first time I went in to rent a dolly to move a refrigerator which they had. I had it about an hour and when I returned it they said no charge. They hoped I would come back, and I did
I rented a truck for two days. When I put gas it in I realized the gauge never moved. when I brought it back and showed them the receipts, they waived the mileage fee for my inconvenience
I would recommend this business and would use them whenever I need to move something< /text>

We rented a 15 ' truck with worn out wiper blades for a one way rental to Washington during winter.   The cab was dirty inside with something spilled all over the cup holders and reeked of cigarette smoke.  They underestimated the mileage in order to fraudulently quote a lower rate then not only charged us additional mileage but made us clean the truck when we dropped it off.  They fold your paperwork and attach it to the key so you can't read it then take it from you and won't return it at the drop off point.  They tell you the only way to resolve a problem is to call the 800 number which tells you to read the paperwork they pulled from you at the drop off, before passing you to someone else.   This was only $12 in my contract but the required cleaning of their unmaintained and  dirty truck and the rude  argumentative response from their 800 number service rep capped the already poor and deceptive service with an F you attitude that leaves you feeling belittled and cheated.

You try to call the Redding location to resolve the problem and they don't respond to calls.  Shoulda known.

I stopped using U-Haul storage locations years ago after repeated fraud issues.   Every time I have tried to do business with ANY U-haul location it goes badly.  All future rentals will be with Penske and any storage location OTHER than U-Haul.

For those with fraud issues contact the headquarters office and ask for Joe.  Or better yet call his personal cell number. xxx-xxx-xxxx.    Local police, BBB or District Attorneys have never helped in any of my complaints with U-Haul but Joe has.</text>

<Name>S Nest< /Name><text>I've used this Uhaul at various times though out my 11 yrs in Redding. They installed a bike hitch on my new car and I've always rented from them. I was suprised to see some of the reviews bc they are always so helpful and kind to me. Its a bummer that some renters before you dont clean up after themselves and that it was missed by them, but I am of the thought that when renting, you should always leave it cleaner than you found it. I ask a lot of questions and want to fully understand my storage space and rental obligations and have always gotten good advice from them. I think they are great and I'd take them with me if I could! :)< /text></record>

<Text>I have been coming here for several years to smog my cars. I drive quite a bit out of my way to come here mostly because I appreciate their no games pricing. When you go to smog your car almost every place you go wants to play games with the pricing and coupons that don't make any sense. This place the price is laid out, straight forward, no surprises. Make an appointment, Pay cash, support a local business. Thank you and You're welcome.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Name>

<Review>My catalytic converter was stolen and they did the repair and added a large metal security plate to the bottom of my car. Well some thieves came back a month or so later and stole the cats from 3 other Prius in my complex! But they didn't take mine. Thank you for the repair!!< /Review>< pictures>

Competitive smog shop. Quick in and out on later model cars. State law says older cars still have to do the treadmill test. A quick read of the onboard diagnostic port is only for the newer cars.<//review>

Brought in a sports car I bought out of state. The smog person pointed out some "illegal" parts that were on the engine.  I explained I bought it that way but he let me know unfortunately they are not valid in California.  He even showed me the company website for the performance parts stating they are not legal for California.  The girl at the front desk was helpful and let me know there was no charge since the smog man had caught the illegal parts before hooking it up to the machine.  I appreciate them not wasting my time or money.< /Review>

Jake owns the shop located right in the heart of Ptown. He is honest and fair, I repeat, he is a mechanic that is honest! He specializes in many vehicles, but services our family BMW better than anyone. I will always bring my cars here thanks to the shop's high level of customer service and expertise.
Thank you PTown Smog & Repair!</review>

Great service from Jake and Herman. I have been coming here for 6 yrs and have brought all my cars and wife's ranging from Acura, BMW M3 and X5 twin turbo, Explorer and Camry. They do a fantastic job and always can rest easy. They are very trustworthy which is a breath of fresh air. I will drive 50 mins just to get my car to them. Love them!!!</text>

<Review>This is the best repair shop in town. The staff is very professional, service is fast. But most importantly, they are honest. Unfortunately for me it was not the first place i went and that's why i ended up spending lots of money for nothing. It's very hard to find a car mechanic who you can trust. If you don't yet have one, this is the place to go! Thumbs up for this place.<//Review>< rating>

< Review>
The Absolute Worse! Stay away from this repair shop if you value your vehicle, seriously! They can not be trusted. I took my car in for a simple smog test. I waited in the lobby and during the smog test they damaged the hood (interior) and wheel well. There is clear evidence that the mechanic was not paying attention to what he was doing and disregarded the safety of my vehicle as he left some equipment in the engine compartment and slammed the hood down. Thus damaging the entire surrounding area. THE WORST PART is that the employees did not tell me about what happened or the damaged they caused. Instead they sent me home as if they did not do anything wrong and pretended like everything was in the original condition. This particular car of mine is a vehicle that (was) in prefect like new condition with barely 10k miles. Rarely driven, mostly for special occasions to car events and shows. To my dismay and horror I opened up the hood today Sunday Dec 16 2018 and discovered all the damage this shop caused to the interior engine compartment of my car.

I would like the business owner to respond back to me and say why this shop thinks its ok to behave in this manor and fail to inform their customers of any damage the shop causes plus not take full responsibility for correcting something like this. There is no question that the mechanic knew about the damage he caused because you can't miss it.

I usually don't raise an issue over minor things but this a MAJOR so I had to come here and WARN potential customers to STAY WAY FROM THIS SHOP.

I will look for a response from management and hope take an honest approach to fixing the damage they caused. I placed my trust in them and they betrayed me in every possible way. This is very upsetting to say the least.

No customer should never be subjected to a terrible experience like this from any business in the community.</Review>

I had just replaced all the hoses and belts w/a reputable company that I know personally...They came back after the test with a picture of a hose cracked...Told me that I have to pay & wait again...They told me a price for the hose, then I get there the hose was more & they up it for install that was not disclosed for said hose that you can see from opening the hood...Not trusting of them so far...We will see...If it does not pass...I will pass on them...I was next and then the Tech had someone roll up in a Maserati trying to cut the line...Never again...NOT RECOMMENDED...Wow...Will be on the no pass go list and wish they would allow for 0 stars or negative stars...Cheapest is not always best...Again NOT RECOMMENDED< /Text>

First come, first served. Took About 20m for the test as promised.

tried there once when I bought my car for a smoke check and oil change, I went there without an appointment but they can arrange me quickly in line, all jobs were done pretty well and definitely I will be there again for my next service, btw, except oil change or smoke check, their professional car repair/diagnose may be worth trying too.< /text>

<review>Pros: Polite service and staff. Good SMOG services. First come first serve.

Cons: Charged ~$1200 for brake parts that have a street price of ~$500. They forgot to service OBD, nor did a shakedown run, leading to a $400 oil leak.

Before having work done I suggest fact-checking their quote for parts prices. Afterwards, I had to have another shop double check their work and fix the oil leak!< /review>< pictures>

Their queuing system is bad. You don't know when your car will be smogged among the other plenty cars. But they are fast, efficient and cheap with coupons. Give them a try and make sure you know how many cars are ahead. Though I asked and was told 6, but I was the last one to get smogged. Too bad.</Review>

<review>I came for a smog check that I was asked by the DMV. For smog check there are no appointments, first come first serve. I liked that they send results directly to the DMV. They spend about 25 minutes per car. One problem is that the waiting room is small, thus no much space to seat. They provide water, coffe and wifi for free.</review>< Time>

Clean, friendly, fast service. The food was. Bit on the oily side, more than I remember About a year ago. Prices were the same about 54.00 without drinks for five entrees off the dim sum menu.< /Text>

The staff was very attentive. Glasses were refilled, extra sauces, bowls and plates were provided and left overs were packed up all without us having to ask. Food was delicious! I definitely recommend this place.< /text>

I ordered a full Beijing Duck for delivery. I really wanted to like it, but, unfortunately, it wasn't as delicious as it is in another restaurant: the skin and the sweet sauce were too salty. Besides, the overall taste of the dish was a little bit strange. In addition, this restaurant uses styrofoam containers and plastic bags, which cannot be reused or recycled. The other place puts everything in paper bags and #5 containers that I can reuse and recycle later. I'm pretty sure, guys, you can do better.<//review>

Keep in mind that three peppers for spicy is EXTREMELY spicy, still great but a lot to take in. Service is fast and efficient. However, don't expect friendly conversations with the workers because they very focused on the next task they have. Overall I love this place! I would definitely recommend it.< /Text>< Pictures>

Stay away from this restaurant!  We had food delivered excited to try something new. We ordered Pork Lo Mein, chicken cashew and egg foo young. All in all about $70 worth of food for two people. The food arrived quickly from GrubHub after placed our order.  The food was barely warm. It arrived so quickly after the order this could only mean that it was already made NOT FRESH sitting in a tray in their kitchen.  The egg foo young was so hard my wife had to use a steak knife to try and cut through it. Mind you this is an egg dish. The Pork Lo Mein smelled bad, had a thick smokey sauce poured on it where the noodles were not cooked and the pieces of pork I wouldn't feed to my dog. The pork dumplings we ordered had a horrible fish smell and taste. When we called to let them know about our food the owner got on the phone and started yelling at my wife right away. They started to blame GrubHub for the poor quality of food and my wife explaind that GrubHub did not make the food. Again the owner started screaming through the phone. All we wanted was a remake. We only live about 10 minutes away. These people obviously do not care about the quality of their food and the owner of this so-called restaurant doesn't give a damn about customer satisfaction. Restaurants are having a tough enough time with the closures and restrictions due to the covid-19 virus. We will absolutely frequent other restaurants we already know care about us as customers. Again, STAY AWAY from this restaurant. You will be extremely disappointed.<//Text>

This is the best Chinese food restaurant.
In studio city.
I highly recommend the daily lobster special it's different everyday. The prices are very affordable. And the owner Rose is very sweet and makes everyone feel right at home.< /text>

A solid dumpling spot - you're going to spend around double versus one of the classic Richmond spots but the location can't be beat for a brunch spot on a nice weekend. They have a few outdoor tables but the indoor ambiance is... meh.</Review>

<Time>1591534969065< /Time><Rate>3<//Rate><text>For a "Dim Sum" spot allocated to the 818, it's pleasant enough and does the trick. There are no traditional carts being driven around (not a problem), the food is fresh and made to order. I felt that the Siu Mai didn't really taste as good as I'd like but they have a lot of options that are unique to this restaurant. Their salt and pepper chicken wings were the best thing out there. Delicious menu items like their House Special chow mein. I was thoroughly happy with my meal.

As for the service, for a chinese restaurant it was really good! Ha I laugh because if you know 626, chinese servers are rough but it's like they catered to the types of clients who'd be coming here so I totally appreciate that!<//text>< Pics>

I've been coming here for years and I never get sick of the food here despite not being a huge dumpling fan in general.

I always get the pork soup dumplings but the shrimp and chicken spicy wantons are pretty good too.

No other soup dumplings can compare to Din Shanghai Rose.<//review>< Resp>

Really enjoyed the Dim Sum here. It's great to know that there is really good Dim Sum in town. The interior design is full of vibrant red colors mixed with black accents. I came here with my family and really enjoyed it. Free validated parking as well.< /Review>

The restaurant also validates parking in the garage right behind it which saved us from the nightmare of looking for street parking. It was a great experience and we will definitely be coming back!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The atmosphere is very modern and clean, which is nice. The restaurant feels very welcoming, visually and through the staff. The food was tasty and a good price as well. I would definitely recommend this place for some authentic Chinese food and delicious dim sum!<//Text>

At least, go somewhere where people do not lie about the order’s estimated pickup time. So that you will not have yo wait 30 min like I did!< /Review>< Resp>

It's been a while since we visited,  but love it! Everything is made to order on the dim sum menu and our waiter, 3rd year in, is still there!  Usually late lunch is quiet but would love to see this place at night. Decor is awesome and Rose is always there making sure QA is on point.<//Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Service is pleasant enough and the place clean, but the food is woefully bland, which makes sense given the older white crowd it draws.
The shrimp har gow, chicken corn soup, shrimp fried rice, and shrimp and crab dumplings all tasted like the same sustenances in different shapes and had no flavor at all. Only the Shanghai pork dumpling had any flavor whatsoever.

We won’t be back. And are immediately going elsewhere to taste the flavors we came here seeking.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Perfect place to visit with family and friends. Pretty place and inviting ambience, the service is also awesome, staff are friendly and nice, they always wear their best smile, it makes me smile too because of them. They served yummy and delicious dim sun and all other foods that makes me and my colleagues come back many times in a week. Highly recommended, best dim sun restaurant.< /Review>< pictures>

Dim sum at its finest. No gimmicks, no fusion, no insane pricing. You get great food and amazing service at a great price point.  Rose the owner is just delightful,  and always ready with a smile.  Try the steamed pork buns, the green beans, spicy chicken wings you will be happy.< /text>

<text>The proprietor, Rose, is a wonderfully friendly and accommodating  woman. You can tell she takes a lot of pride in her establishment and has a well earned rapport with the local patrons.

The menu offers a broad range of choices. Each dish is consistently of high quality and great flavor. Overall, it is definitely several notches higher than the standard fast food approach to Chinese cuisine that you can find in many corner plazas. The decor and ambiance is cozy and inviting, everywhere is meticulously clean and the seating areas are tastefully appointed with numerous cultural artifacts.

One of the most popular if not busiest Chinese establishments in the Studio City area . The Sunday dim sum is extremely popular with a great selection at a reasonable price. This is highly recommended place for a pleasant dining experience.</text>< Response>

Upscale Chinese restaurant.  It has good ambience.  I'd be comfortable taking my parents or a business colleague here.   The dim sum is middle-of-the-road and somewhat expensive.   They are kid-friendly.</Text>

In Studio City this is the place to go.  The noodle dishes as well as the beef entrees are to die for.  Friendly staff and pleasant decor make it a very worthwhile place to visit.< /Review>

The food is absolutely exquisite!  As a foodie and brewery owner my palette isn't easily satisfied. Shanghai Rose is one of a kind in today's world of chains and mediocrity. Shanghai Rose had the best, most fresh ingredients and I knew I was in for a treat from the very first sip of my egg drop soup.  The chicken potstickers were divine and the mongolian beef and kung pao chicken combination for lunch transported my tastebuds without 2 days of flying. In short, best Chinese food in So Cal...possibly All Cal. Two thumbs WAAAAAY up my friends. CAN'T MISS!!! 👍👍<//Review>

Authentic & delicious Chinese dim-sum right here in Studio City!   Especially love their soup, sticky rice, Shanghai dumpling, garlic sautee bok choy and Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce.  Usually do this place for lunch during the week, on the quiet side but the service is always fast.< /text>

<review>Shanghai Rose is a great place for a social or business dim sum lunch,; nice ambiance, attentive service and validated parking (even if you stay for hours to enjoy a leisurely relaxed meal).However, food quality depends on current chef and is not on par with dim sum in Monterey Park or DTLA.
Began with salt & pepper calamari listed on menu as a starter and if it were the usual battered rings, it would serve as an appetizer. But this was squid hood cut bite size, battered and then stir fried, more like an entree style'. The turnip cake was plain, just fried daikon but tasty. My favorite dim sum is rice wrap which was authentic and delicious on a previous visit. But this time was disappointed because there was mainly rice and just a bit of pork, and not steamed long enough for the rice to become glutinous. The BBQ pork seemed more like red-cooked or roast pork than the usual dry-rack BBQ. The sesame buns were the best I've tasted, light and not too sweet and unlike  the typical  "cannon ball." usually served elsewhere and much too heavy for dessert..
I prefer week days because you order from a menu (instead of passing carts) so your food is cooked fresh to order. Foodies might prefer M Park or DTLA but for locals it is convenient and enjoyable..<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

A little dead on a weekend morning. Dusty cloth napkins that will put lint all over your clothing. They don't let you mark the paper menu for dim sum, which can get difficult to track when you have more than a few people and you can't really see how much you're ordering. Doesn't feel very authentic.</Review>

<text>I was so happy to see this place in the San Fernando Valley  they serve dim sum and we all know if we want Dim Sum we have to travel to the San Gabriel Valley.  I was a bit confused by the outside that looks like a palace made me feel like it was an Indian restaurant, but the inside Is definitely decorated very Chinese.

The food was great Har gow, dumplings, clams, green beans all fantastic, but what really won me over was that they had so many dim sum seafood options, lobster and shrimp, scallops, crab.  Most Dim sum places are all pork, I like to have options.  The service great!  and they have other classic Chinese dishes if you're looking for something more than Dim Sum alone.

On The Weekends they do Dim Sum Carts, Can't wait to go back for that!<//text>< Response>

<response>None</response><Text>The food here was better than I originally thought. I had dim sum here once and a take out of two lunch specials. I wouldn't say it's San Gabriel quality, but it's definitely pretty close to Chinatown quality, which makes it the most authentic out of all Chinese restaurants in Studio City. The dim sum had quite a variety, offering even chicken feet. Everything from the shrimp hargow to the pork shumai was pretty authentic and tasty. I must say that I was most impressed with the dessert sesame balls. Some of the best I've ever had. You will not find any other establishments that sell this, or egg tarts, in Studio City.

The downfall is that the place is a bit pricey, about 1.5 times more than what you would pay for dim sum in Monterey Park. However, this place is fine enough that I don't feel so compelled to go 30 miles out of my way to eat dim sum. It's really the most you can ask for in a predominantly upperclass White neighborhood.</Text>< user_name>

i've never actually had dim sum and neither had my friend so we decided to check this place out. the sim sum dishes are all affordable and ended up being plenty of food. we got the lobster dumplings (honestly only thing i wasn't a fan of), the chicken dumplings, the egg rolls, the pork buns, and the general tso chicken.
we both really enjoyed the meal and were stuffed by the time we finished.</text>

Came here to fix a flat tire. Waited over two hours for them to tell me no. They told me that my tire was too worn out and needed a replacement. Went to a different place and they were able to patch it up for me. Just go somewhere else.</Text>

Came in to get my three month old tire replaced because it picked up a screwdriver on the road and stabbed the sidewall. Was in and out of the place within 45 minutes and there was no mishandling/damage on the wheel. I'd definitely come back!< /Text>

Took over 2 hours just to change two tires. Was told at least two times during those two hours that my car was almost ready. They also don't seem to care much about covid. Some workers had their face shields up without wearing masks. The workers who were wearing masks weren't even covering their noses.</text>

<Text>I had great service from Sallie the manager, replaced 3 tires, battery, wipers, change oil, etc. Unfortunately the check motor light went on 3days after. On a Saturday, I called back explained to a male employee who answered. He said he needed to charge 99.00 dollars to check it because they didn't do it. I've decided to go somewhere else.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I'm a consistent Firestone Customer, with a Firestone Credit card as well. Just needed a tire patched, a quick 10-20 minute fix. I stood around and waited 10 minutes for someone to even talk to me, then was told that I had to wait an hour and a half just for a tire patch job.

My local Firestone in Chino Hills would have just squeezed me in real quick.< /review>

Despite reading all the review on Google and yelp I still went for service on my 350Z. It had over heated and turned out to be a thermostat. To be honest I felt the price was a tad high on the part but for convenience sake I gave the OK for the repair. Other than that the experience was good, Josh kept me updated on the whole process and I think I will keep them in mind for any further service needs.< /review>

Came in for a oil change and tire rotation on Saturday April 15, 2017 Took about 4-5 hours for car to get done . Once I got it home I noticed that the hub caps on my car are bent sticking out of the rim as well broken. If this firestone location can't even put hub caps on my car with out breaking them what does that say about the service . Called the manager Freddy at 7am on Monday 04/17/17 since they where closed on Easter explaining the problem and called him back at 8am allowing him to review the pictures I sent him . He's responds was got your pictures I will call you back once I finish with the customers i have . So once they got your money they really don't care about your situation or damage done to your car as a result of there inexperienced crew working on your car . Buyer beware it appears we are only a number at this location and they really don't care what damage they do to your car.<//review>

Extremely slow, they had my car for 5 hours and they couldn’t fix anything. They didn’t even have enough skill to identify that something was wrong. No effency, just “come back the next day” like I don’t have a job.</review>

<review>BEYOND UNPROFESSIONAL
If I could give them 0 stars I would. Called on Tuesday to order a new tire. I set an APPOINTMENT for Thursday at 7am. My gut told me to call them Wednesday to confirm. They didn't order the tire and told me they could have the tire by 12noon. I took time off work and had this scheduled to be easy for everyone and they didn't care. I immediately cancelled my order and the gentleman seemed relieved. WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.
Got the same tire for half the price at Tire Zone in West Covina on San Bernardino Rd.</review>< pics>

Last time you up-saled me a battery  & found the same battery in still.
Unfortunately you charge a disposal fee when I saved the old ones, disposal & oil disposal fees just pop out of nowhere there, didnt get a oil change.
Your high!!!...  $250 higher then anyone else.<//Text>

Terrible service. You have to wait a really long time (all day practically) and get ripped off at the end. Also to any customer considering an oil change from these guys, don't fall for their bs when they tell you they can't do it due to the drain plug being damaged and that you have to purchase a new oil pan and pay for all the labor as well.  Most car washes will do it for cheap. Thanks for reading.<//review>

<Review>I dont know if the manager here is still some white guy named "josh" all i know is that he tried charging me for a  "brake fluid flush" or something similar to that, basically he wanted to charge for a service my car did not need and ever since this happened i never have done business with this place and because other firestone locations have been caught and in trouble for doing this exact thing. Anyways just wanted to let the owners and managers of this firestone know that you guys lost a customer for life.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2d785646459dd:0x491b3cb902a935a2<//GmapID><Time>1477710605088</Time><user_name>ya tu sabes<//user_name>< Rating>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Have never had any trouble with this shop.  I went last week and ordered a pair of tires for my wife's camry.  They did not have them in stock.  I was told they'd get a pair the next day and hold them til today.  Today I called and spoke to Milton, he stated he went on vacation and left a note for his manager, but no one held the tires for me.  So I asked if he could order the tires as a courtesy from the nearest store.  He said they don't normally do that but they can do it as a courtesy.  He said he could not do it today.  I said this is the second week I'll have to wait, he said you can go to the Arcadia store.  I asked for his regional manager's number to ask whey a customer of over 10 years with multiple can't get a courtesy especially since I was already let down once, but i could not because Milton hung up on me.  Their website says, "When you need car tires you can count on, choose Firestone" I chose firestone but apparently 10 years of patronage is not enough for a courtesy.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Great location, with food/stores/freeway access around the corner and a remarkable view of Mt. Baldy. Maintenance staff here are the best; always friendly and professional. Requests are always handled by staff in a timely manner. Our neighbors are great. We have accidently left our garage door open overnight SEVERAL times, and never once has anyone taken anything (despite our bikes, snowboards, etc. being on full display). Never in the 2+ years we've resided here have we heard our neighbors through the walls; the insulation is highly effective.

There are pros and cons with every home, be it an apartment, condo, house, etc. The pros at Sierra Heights far outweigh the occasional cons. We are very happy here, and would recommend residency to anyone seeking a safe, family friendly environment.<//Review>

We moved in when the property was under Greystar. We didn’t have many issues until the new company, AMC took over. The standard of living QUICKLY deteriorated. Trash was overflowing into drive spaces,  kids were literally darting across drive spaces constantly, gym and pool spaces were being closed because kids were not being supervised, management was quick to respond that there was nothing they could do. It was to the point that we asked about getting out of our lease, just to be told
about the insane fees…. only to learn a few weeks ago that THEY LOST OUR LEASE RENEWAL and we had been on month to month for over a year. Add to it that we were STILL being told we couldn’t break a lease… that they KNEW was on a month-to-month agreement (that we never made). They spend a ton of money repainting… and repainting… anddddd repainting the complex… and the speed bumps… in the rain (seriously), but investing in a front gate that works properly, or upgraded amenities, isn’t an option. The newest manager is a sweet heart, but one good employee cannot improve the inadequacies of people who refuse to do their job properly. So glad to be out of the complex, and away from the sub-par “luxury” facade they run.<//review>

Not sure where AMC finds their office employees but they are always unprofessional & rude. Drove out an hour in traffic to get information on availability in person since no one knows how to answer a ringing telephone? What’re you getting paid for exactly, besides NOT doing your job? Not the point, as I’m sitting in front of the office getting ready to step inside the lady squeezes herself inside & puts a sign on the door saying she wouldn’t be back for a hour & 45 mins. What a joke.</text>

The management office is responsive, the grounds are immaculate, and maintainance responds in a timely manner. I especially like that each apartment has access to an enclosed garage and comes with a washer and dryer. I just resigned my lease for another year and look forward to extending my stay in this comfortable surrounding.</Review>< user_id>

Me and my roommate came to view a listing at this location & management seemed very disinterested and came off as rude. We simply wanted to set an appointment to view an apartment and were not even given a brochure or told of any upcoming options. If anything this experience helped us dodge a bullet of getting stuck with bad management. Found the perfect place with much better management & customer service elsewhere.</Text>

<user_name>hawaiisunfun<//user_name><Text>Should have negative 7 stars: according to a person who lived there, there were major safety violations, like windows not being able to be open and fire sprinklers not going off when a fire took place due to a water leak. Management didn't care. This person is left without a home or anyone to go to thanks to the faulty management.

Others who are in the apartment noted the same lackluster management.

Even if the apartments look good on the outside, don't be fooled - looks can be deceiving.< /Text><user_id>116350762715614648214</user_id><Time>1613401227331<//Time>< response>

My first time visiting this property was an unpleasant one. On 3/6/2021; My mother and I went there to get information about availability and to ask other general questions. The young lady at the front never opened the door or even looked up as we knocked on the door repeatedly to gain entry or be directed elsewhere. We also called the office while standing there looking at the receptionist. She never answered nor looked up.<//Text>

This place is beautiful! 😀 Its next to a quiet and nice housing neighborhood. Its close to 210 freeway access. Amazing views from giant natural light windows. Helpful staff. Very close to schools and walking tracks. Nice clean apartment homes with pool, gym, and park area. We have lived here for over a year and have had few issues overall. Great location. Probably the best neighborhood in San Bernardino County! Great job Sierra Heights staff. Thanks for everything! 😊
Thanks for the 500 dollar rent discount for the November Raffle. Y'all are awesome. All we had to do is pay rent on the 1st to enter the Raffle and we won!!!!! Thanks Nicole for the information and great news from the office 😀😀</Review>

The only down fall is the parking there is not enough parking spaces inside the complex so we have to park on the street. There’s neighbors with 5 cars in one household. They should have parking permits for the extra car.<//review>< time>

<review>Please issue parking permits for tenants immediately. This will help the over crowded parking situation. Also don't tow or threaten to tow your own tenants; who pay extremely high rents. Please train your new front desk person in customer service. She was rude to me on Saturday around 12:20pm in the office discussing the parking and towing situation. I was shocked by her disposition. I was towed once and had to pay $200 to get my car back and sierra heights could care less. The first time my mother visited our apartment  you nearly towed her also. PLEASE STOP! Where is this 96 hr. parking/tow rule highlighted in our lease? Please advise ---<//review>< pics>

<Gmap_id>0x80c336396c2a2a03:0x144169f0d343053b</Gmap_id><Text>There is nothing really competitive here. This is a pretty "standard" California apartment. By standard, look up what $800/month apartment looks like in any other part of the United States, and you'll get the picture. I doubt the people at the leasing office even know I exist, aside from when it comes time to collect rent.

Metaphorically speaking, my apartment is like one of those pictures that gets worse the longer you look at it. In fact, I'm sure my apartment was not move-in ready when spent my first night here. I had to put in several work orders within less than a week. My apartment did come with a roll of half-used duct tape and a partially filled Vacant Log filled out as plus however.

The materials used in the apartment yells lowest bidder. The savings really don't get passed onto you as an occupant-- as cheap materials usually equals higher electric, gas, water, and sewage cost for the occupant.

Management does a poor job communicating with its residents. Sometimes they'll shut off the water for maintenance, but they'll never tell you until unless you call them to find out why the water isn't running in your apartment. I just found out one of their pools is closed because its an electrical safety hazard, but management of course, would never tell you that*. I could never figure out how to go their gym without obnoxiously going through their front doors and having a awkward conversation with them about why I can't use the regular entrance to the gym. Apparently, you have a to wiggle your keys in a certain way to unlock the regular gym door. That doesn't sound very luxury to me.

Speaking of gym access, management was quick to close the gym (as well as their other community amenities) when COVID became a bigger problem. Which realistically, is what they were supposed to do. The problem is, I'm still paying full price for amenities that have been closed off to me for almost half of my one-year lease. Even my car insurance company has given me a small partial refund because they know I won't on the road as much. That's really saying something as a company.

Anyways, my point being, is that Sierra Heights is very "standard" and non-competitive. I expect a high increase on my rent when it comes to renew my lease because thats what non-competitive apartment complexes do.<//Text><username>Steven Selassie<//username>< response>

<Review>I’ve lived here for 2 years and it was perfect the staff at the leasing office was always friendly, never had an issue with them or the way they run the complex. Since the management changed everyone who’s working here changed ( they are RUDE and unprofessional ) since they came until now they keep coming to our houses under the world ( maintenance) and they could’ve finished everything in one week but instead they kept coming for over a month maybe even two months I lost counting, they are so rude when they knock the door they don’t realize if they’re is someone sick or a baby sleeping and when they come in they leave a big mess and when I went to complain they were like no we didn’t. If you want to live somewhere to be comfortable and respected DO NOT COME HERE because they will definitely make sure to make you feel like your living at their house it’s not like your paying for it maybe they think your staying here for free.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1572380188558, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback, Rafal.

We have been living here for approximately two years and I must say it has gotten better with time.  The Carolyn, Bryan, Dave,  Pedro and Francisco and the other staff (whom I do not know by name as of yet because they are new) are the best!!!  They are friendly and very helpful.  They are always very accommodating.  I needed air placed in my tires and there was Dave to the rescue.  Whenever I see Pedro or Francisco and let them know of a problem I am having, they are there to fix it.  The grounds are always well kept and the trees are trimmed and the grass cut.  The buildings just got a major overhaul -- a new paint job.  It looks absolutely fantastic, like a new complex.  I truly love the new colors (white, blue and gray) which are much brighter than before.  You cannot ask for a better place to live.  The neighbors are friendly and everyone speaks to you even if they don't know you.  If you ever want a great place to live Sierra Heights is the place.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I have a friend who has lived here for many years and cannot bear the chaos and brutality of the new property management company and decided to move to another apartment next month. I also decided to leave here. This is a very bad, rude and illegal management company. Randomly evict tenants' friends and harass tenants' homes at will.
No one cared about the plants in the garden, they were already dying. There is a breath of death everywhere.< /text>

Hey I've  been living here for almost 2 years, the apartment are great customer service is bad. My garage is not opening right now, I called the emergency phone number and Samuel the head ground keeper said," this is not an emergency because it's after hours". I explained to that my work equipment is in there and I will have to miss work, "he said check your lease agreement this is not an emergency".</review>

<Text>I found the entire staff at Sierra Heights to be most accommodating and accessible.

We are going on 3 yrs here at Sierra Heights and love living here. Mrs.Caralyn and Mr.Bryan are amazing in the front office and the Maintenance crew are awesome and helpful.
Our community just got a new playground set for the kids and all the building are about to get a fresh coat of paint!! Pet friendly as well and close to great schools for the kids 😃</Text>

<review>I used to enjoy living here, now I hate it. I can’t wait to move. The rent super over priced nearly 2,500 a month with utilities that keep rising for no reason. Broken cabinets that are never fixed. A carpet that hasn’t been repaired. Yes I’ve noticed management several times. When I moved in I had water damage due to something happening on the unit above and did they open the ceiling to check for mold? Nope just painted over it. When I had a leak in the rain I had wait weeks for someone to fix it. The new management is terrible. The owner is rude and noisy. I was walking my dog and in a very sarcastic way asked me if I needed a poop bag and told me I have to clean my dogs poop and my dog wasn’t even pooping he was peeing. Maybe before you accuse your paying renter you should open your eyes and check. Also told me I have to notify her of my dog but the original management took a pet deposit from me and it is actually in my lease. This place has really gone down hill for the price I can move somewhere with managers that aren’t rude and actually appreciate their residents. My advice save your money and move somewhere else. I’m counting the days until my lease is up. And no I don’t want to talk to your unhelpful fake office so don’t bother responding to my review. The older management was much more kind and helpful unlike this team. Obviously it’s not just me read the reviews below a lot of people feel the same way about the owner and new management.< /review>< rate>

Every other day something breaks in the Apartment and we have to place a work order. Packages get stolen. It’s suppose to be a gated community but the gates are always open. Manager ( Suzanne ) is not considerate, if their workers damage our personal property that’s not their problem. I would not recommend this place.<//text>

We had a flood in our unit because the main line had backed up. I noticed the flood when I came home from work. I called the emergency line and made the report. Within 20 mins of my call the service manager Dave was at my unit and started working on the problem. They fixed my problem the very same night. I did not even have to leave my unit. Dave is awesome and having him on site gives us security knowing our problems even late at night will be addressed promptly. We have rented before and have yet to see such quick and friendly service. The staff in the leasing office is also very friendly and accommodating. If your looking at this community feel good knowing you will be well taken care of with a pleasant staff.<//text>

< Review>
Been here almost 2 years.  Old management team was more considerate and had better customer service skills.  New management is cold and inconsiderate.  They push their stress from maintenance projects and inconveniences off to the residents.  However, they are themselves, inflexible and harsh when dealing with maintenance issues.  They play this weird game of pushing responsibility to other offices or blaming the "front office" or the "management office", when they are in the same room.  Ridiculous to have tenants in the middle of such nonsense.  Front gate is always broken....not secure<//Review>

Sierra Heights Aparment is a great place to live. Quiet community, kid friendly, fabulous aminties, the units have fire places, and laundry hook up in units or in the garage depending on the size of your unit. Although they have switched management and ownership. Office staff are customer friendly, courteous, and greet you even if they are busy helping someone just to let you know they notice you and will be right with you. The maintenance staff is punctual, and respond to work orders within 24hours and of course if it’s an emergency they respond within a reseasonable amount of time. I enjoy living here, my neighbors seem to enjoy living here as well. Also there is a elementary school up the street and middle school up the road. Food places and grocery store one block away. Clean community as well. I’d recommend to a friend or family member. Prices are fair market value.</Text>

That's mean , just expect isolation world or no one can call you while in the fitness center even for emergency call from family, which is horrible situation for those seek healthy life style for tenant.
Hopefully, this review will change new management to provide us solid wifi coverage.

Update on 04/01/2019:

I was work out in fitness center and still no sign of wifi at all and willingness from new owner to give us solid wifi coverage in there.
Let us give an idea to help your tenant without sacrificing your needs for wifi , ask T-mobile to get reception booster install for free just like the gave signal booster to their customers closed to fitness center.

I really should of done my research before choosing this horrible place as a home. It was not until after My family and I had moved in that we began seeing the horrors of this apartment complex. The apartment it was not clean and there was hair inside the bathtubs,gnats in the fridge, and roach egg shells and a maggot in the dishwasher....yes ROACHES at a “luxurious apartment”. We were counting down the days until our lease was up and to finish it off they charged us $650.00 for move out fees.
Also the manager is very unprofessional, on numerous occasions I have requested to speak to Carolyn Olea and she would never call back. I would then walk into the office and she would just be on the phone for long periods of time and there would be a line of people wanting to speak to her.
The maintance supervisor Dave is always very rude and unfriendly. My maintenance requests would always be delayed.
Just do yourself a favor and save yourself from this nightmare called Sierra Heights!!<//review>

More than 2 weeks, 18 days to be exact after I gave my phone number & NO ONE call or follow up our complaint (made my phone number star last 2 digit number now).
People can see the real intend with Grey Star management of Sierra Heights apartment in Alta Loma , CA 91737.
I kept pictures of those cars didn't move for weeks.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Response to management 04/21/2017 10.42 AM  :
I just add 1 more star for the response from apartment management.
I've called & no action, at last I did came to the office couple weeks ago & met with apartment manager & maintenance manager in the same room & talk about it, also showing some cars that parking in the same spot in weeks ! (Try to help apartment management to show it to them, policy max 3 days parking on same spot), then tomorrow I checked same cars still there , even today 04/21/2017 at 10.07 those cars still there!
So sad about management commitment vs reality.
Serious to change to be better serving to tenants? Here is my phone number : 909-288-13**.
Looking forward to hear it from you.

^^^^
Yesterday Sunday, May 28,2017 , I've talk to Bryan Helland (assistant community manager) and talk about parking problem , also else)
He gave me his email address & willing to follow up this matter.
Hopefully get real problem solver & will update later.

^^^^^*****
10/18/2017
After a while, I  can say this apartement community service is getting better.
Good job to the management.

Thank you.

Same problem to find parking space inside the apartment , you can park outside in the street at your own risk.
Couples car parking on the street breaks in happened.
Just hoping management issues parking permit & enforcing car garage for car only, not for storage!

Suggestion for future residents, just come in the night & observe it.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I have lived at this same complex for 15+ years. A horrendous atmosphere has been created since the GREYSTAR management company took over about a year ago. GREYSTAR is utterly malicious and outright hateful toward their tenants. I've had to sue them twice for utterly incompetent management practices. The judge agreed with me and I won both cases but I'm still having to take court action to collect my judgements. Greystar will not even recognize the law.

The lease requires tenants to use their garages for parking however tenants generally use these garages for storage. Management refuses to enforce the lease. All the outside parking is full because the garages are stuffed with stuff. The result is that you will have to park your second car on the street. The street is lined with cars for blocks in either direction. This causes a serious viability hazard for traffic entering and exiting the complex. There have been several memorial wreaths on the street.

Don't live here. The life I save may be your own.<//Text>

<text>I chose this place originally because my last name is Best lol 😂 and thought of how ironic it is because I love burritos. I can honestly say that I have a new favorite place! Seriously it was the best burrito I’ve had in the Bay Area.  The price was really great and I normally skip the guacamole because I prefer sliced avocado more, but their guacamole was fresh and unprocessed. I’m extremely happy with my experience!</text>< Pics>

<Review>I was walking into the restaurant about 2 days in hopes of getting some back home nostalgia, instead I walk into a hostile situation in which I saw a guy behind the counter telling a customer that she must not want her money. It seems she's written a review about it as well. The more I thought about it the more upset I became and I thought if anything I could write about it being that my reaction wouldn't have been as calm as hers so I left shortly after hearing him start to berate her calling her out of her name when she simply stated she didn't be disrespected when it was their error. From the short interaction I gathered: the cashier for some reason way over charged her for a single burrito. Due to the amount, they refused to return the money until they saw ID. My personal opinion is honestly the least important being as I only witnessed a glimpse, the woman was righteously upset but not belligerent. She still her ground, it was simple, they overcharged and should have refunded the money. The truth, he verbally assaulted her which is not only unprofessional but humiliating as a customer and especially as a reputation of business. As a black female myself, I truly wanted to pick up my sword but instead I vow to never return and encourage my friends that live in the area to not buy from there and spread the word until this man no longer works there. He called her a b word, a black $#&$# in the 30-45 secs i stood in the doorway.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>This place is formatted much akin to Subway sandwiches. You go to the far right of the counter, order your food, pay at the register on the far left. I ordered two hard shell tacos. At first I was taking aback buy the $7.50 price tag for the two tacos. However, I later found that the tacos wereloaded with a lot of goodies. Rice, beans, pico de gallo, cheese. Quite interesting. Never seen this before. Quite delicious.<//Text>< UserId.>

Spicy Chicken - DRY (all caps necessary)

Terrible Burrito and their soda pricing doesn't make sense.

They have cans (12oz) for $1 and bottles (20oz) for $2.25. Maybe they do this on purpose so that I would feel like im getting a great deal by buying 2 cans of soda instead of  a bottle = more soda for less $. NICE (probably unintentional) MIND GAME.</Text>< Pics>

This place has hella good burritos, and at a good price. Parking can be a little tight so pack your patience but it's worth it. Lots of choices, all of them good. Definitely recommend.</text>

Korean owned with a couple of employees that were friendly and generous with its portions.

It's a hole in the wall sort of place but it manages to hit the spot for a quick place to pick up some Mexican / Korean fused burritos.</Text>

I ordered 2 combo Burritos
1: was teriyaki beef with shrimp with, everything,teriyaki sauc rice beans chesse pico de gallo guacamole teriyaki sauce plus hot sauce. There was nothing in it that I asked for.
The 2nd one was 4 my boyfriend stk and shrimp combo Burrito.
With no beans. With rice sour cream guacamole chesse pico de Gallo. lettuce hot sauce
Nothing we ordered was on these burritos. There was something green looking like spinach or kale not lettuce at all,  pickled jalapenos which we did not as for. According to the bill total it was like $26.00 & change.according to there menu pricess on there website
10.75 + 10.75= $21.05
We picked up it was 26$$
And we got nothing we ordered inside of our burritos< /Text>

<Review>Definitely not the best burrito but I like that they make it how you want it. I found the meat options interesting as well as some of the Asian fusion stuff. It is a little pricey for the quality.< /Review>< Date>

The burritos here aren't the "best" like they claim they are. But they are much better than chipotle which gave my  wife bloody diarrhea. A complaint is that they don't scrape the gum of the tables. Also, the floors looked like they had never been cleaned when i ate there.<//Text>

I said hello and the man behind the counter said something to me, I couldnt hear him so I asked him to please repeat what he said, he said very loudly, WE ARE NOT OPEN!! it's 5 minutes to 9:00 am. I asked what time he opened he said 9am, I again looked at his clock and there was 5 min to spare I asked if he could take my order and he said "WE ARE NOT OPEN" ok, I can take a hint so I left.

< Review>
I was craving a burrito with ground beef as the meat, and the burrito I got was literally tasteless. Absolutely no seasoning despite all the other ingredients. The tortilla tasted like raw flour, the rice and beans had no seasonings,the ground beef either. With the addition of cheese and sour cream this concoction was still tasteless. Go somewhere else.<//Review>

<text>Best Burritos has **four** different options for vegetarian/vegan burritos, including tofu, three-mushroom, primavera (zucchini, bell peppers, onions and yellow squash) and "vegee." All are excellent.

I don't think there's another tacqueria in the bay that comes close for vegetarian options.<//text>< pictures>

Black own. I love this wash house. The owner I belive is a black man. He means business and he appears to play no games. I've only net him once.He keeps the premises clean and he has signs on the outside and inside of the wash house that states information concerning wearing face masks, coughing or sneezing and temperature in English and Spanish. I really like that the washers and dryers are ran by putting money onto cards. I love it and I love it. He receives 10 stars from me and my husband. The washer and dryers are in great condition.</Text>

The best in Oakland
It’s so clean and Mac the owner is just so kind and honest! There’s 6 nearer laundry shops around me but this place is the only place I go to. Other shops are too nasty. Mac keeps this place so clean and proper.
The owner is so polite and down to earth. He’s doing a lot of things to help out the needy in this time of crisis. He deserves the most loyal customers! I am one now.<//text>

Best laundromat experience I've had such far. Mac the owner is so welcoming, you feel right at home.He helped me through out the whole process. Even pushed the cart with my clothes in it to my car.  Thank you for bringing this wonderful place into our community. Thank you for showing love and hospitality to your community.<//text>

I am beyond grateful to have found this wash house!!! My sister and I had about a month's worth of laundry from the house and my disabled client's linens. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner this morning and he has the best spirit. I could tell he is from the South because of his hospitality. The wash house is clean, very easy to use and an overall wonderful experience. From one black business owner to another, I appreciate you and yoir kindness!</review>

I had a terrible experience at another laundromat and saw The Wash house just around the block to my apartment so I decided to walk over and try it out! My boyfriend and I LOVE this place. We love that it’s always so clean, there is wifi provided so you’re never bored waiting for your clothing 😉
The owner is a super sweet and kind man who seems to love the people he is providing The Wash house for!!! He is always so welcoming and kind.
Thank you for adding this wonderful experience to Oakland! We need more places like this!!!</Text>

one of the cleanest, if not the cleanest, laundermat I have been to. Also it has free wifi. But most of all,  no need to use annoying coins! instead you pay  using a card, which you can get from a machine in there, or just use an app(shinePay) , which is what I go for because it is convinient.

Owner is also very nice, and cares about the safety of customers. He makes sure everything is disinfected and everyone is wearing a mask.  Today,  I forgot to bring a mask in with me so he a gave me one for FREE so I didn't have to go back.</Text>

Clean, convenient, easy to use. No quarters needed. ATM to get cash. Cash to fill cards to work the machines. Owner was here twice while I washed and dried one load and was awesome. Haven’t felt so comfortable in any other laundromat. Will be back! Recommend for sure!<//review>

<review>I love this place! I just moved to the area from the east coast. I like it because you don’t need change. You put everything on a card. The card machine takes bills. They also have an ATM machine so you can get bills if needed. It usually isn’t crowded and the staff are friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that is closed too early.< /review>< gmap_id>

Very clean and well kept. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is more expensive than other places. In order to run one of the medium machines with hot water, it costs over 6 dollars. The convenience of not having to use coins and also to be able to pay by smartphone is great.</text>

< review>
The Wash House made me feel LIKE the red carpet was layed out for me like a welcoming comitty of my own this wash house is lilke the only way you want it to be when you washing,  a safe n clean place in the deep east part of Oakland  could be really unsafe! !!! Or full of things you dnt wanna see nor deal with( Pan handlers DRUGS to  x y nz..)But not!!
THE WASH HOUSE IS PEACEFUL DIVERST COMMUNITY I'VE LIVED HERE  FOR 20 PLUS YEARS THE PAST 5 I'VE BEEN RESTING WIT THEM POLAR BEARS IN THE NORTH UNTIL 6MOS AGO I MADE THE ALPHABETbecame  OUR RESTING PLACE ...I DNT KNW HOW WHEN IT'S ALWAYS BUSY....
PROMPTED ME TO GIVE CREDITTHAT'S DUE TO
The manager WHOM  keeps it clean . His warm spirit must BE HEAVEN SENT BECAUSE I WAS PROUD TO SEE HIM HELP A FAMILY THAT HAD NO WHERE TO GO GET SAFE AND HE FEED THEM FROM HIS HEART SEEING THIS WAS VERY ENCOURAGING THAT' i WAS HOME AND GLAD TO BE ! THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE I RATHER B THEN HERE WHERE THE WASH HOUSE ISN'T A SHELTER BUT  THE MANAGER fed this family helped them get safe !  Kept up with DUTIES AS WELL AS HELP ME AND OTHERS TO THEIR CAR LIKE A REAL MANN DOES!!!!  NO ONE  GETS  LEFT BEHIND TRULEY WARMED MY HEART....II'M A EARLY  BIRD SO I WAS SEARCHING FOR THE NUMBER TO SEE WHAT TIME it OPEN  JUST TO STUMBLE UPON THE CHANCE TO RATE SO I DID THKS MR MANAGER @THE WASHHOUSE!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!
GOD KNOWS YOUR NAME VERY WELL  100<//review>

I went in today as a first time customer and loved it! I got a manicure, a pedicure, and my eyebrows waxed. All of it was excellent! I had Tracy as my nail tech and she was so gentle and worked with my ticklish feet lol. I loved my experience so much and I would highly recommend CT nails to anyone.< /Review>

< Review>
I just moved to the area and found this wonderful nail salon for my much needed pedicure! Vu and his staff were welcoming, courteous and professional. The salon was spotlessly clean and my pedi was excellent.. The pull down safety shield mounted to the pedi chair was handy and all safety protocols were used, eg temperature taken at front door,  required hand washing before service. I look forward to my next appointment and becoming a regular client and part of the salon family. God Bless Vu and his business.<//Review>

<text>Had a great experience here! Got a gel mani and normal pedi. Everyone was nice and accommodating and Lily did a great job! Seriously like flawless. It was my first gel mani as well so I was new to the process. However, my hands actually got a little sunburnt from the UV so I’ll have to figure out how to avoid that if I do gel again. Just FYI they charge $1 to use a credit card so bring cash if you want to avoid that.< /text><rate>5<//rate>< username>

<review>I would like to welcome back CT Nails after a long closure to help prevent community spread. They have been sorely missed. I have a 90 years mom and myself. I am 66 years black male. CT Nails has always been professional, curtious and helpful each time I visit this store. It's a joy to find a place that is worthy of my full confidence and trust. I don't need a lot of care to my nails, but, pedicure is a very important health maintanice for me.  In all honesty, they seem to serve everybody the same.< /review>< Pics>

They are definitely following all state guidelines in social distancing and sanitation. Appointment only and just a couple customers at a time. Only 3 employees, no wait room, no other guests inside. Everyone gets temperature checked and asked to wash your hands upon entering. Everyone wearing masks and management was cleaning. Great job keeping the community safe.</Review>< Pictures>

I have tried SO many nail salons in the Palm Springs area and this is one of my favorites.  They do a great job, super clean and accommodating.  Today I went for the second time and it was still as good as I remembered from the first time!</text>

<Review>This nail shop is friendly and appreciative of their clients. The stand by their work if you are not happy they will make you happy with their work. The prices are very reasonable and lower then most places. I go here because they are respectful and courteous and I know that they care about my satisfaction.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>103041506998658261197<//userid>< date>

I never go to nail salons. I got an infection from a previous experience and have never gone back. While I was here on vacation from another country, I thought I'd give this salon a try. I was immediately greeted by a really professional man in a suit, I'm guessing the owner manager. I was taken in really quickly and they got me set up with (I think his name is) Brian. GREAT GUY! He was so respectful of the sensitive areas on my hands and feet, including my ticklish spots! He was quick and professional. He did everything quickly but not sloppily! My finger nails and toes nails look AND feel amazing. Thank you CT Nails for such an amazing and much needed experience!< /text>

Today was my first time experiencing this nail salon. I was not satisfied with my nails and instead of the owners accepting the criticism, the male owner proceeds to raise his voice at me. I got my nails done by the female owner and she was very withdrawn and unfriendly. I am also the only black person in the nail salon. I think this place is racist and they treat black customers like trash. They are very mean here and unwilling to accept a mistake on their part. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone of color. I should stuck with LT nails. They are much better than this horrible nail salon.< /text>

I just left here. All I did was ask the gentleman how much is a fill I wanted to get cash out of my bank plus you always want to leave a tip. Well he responded in a very loud voice automatically assuming I may have an issue with the price he had me earlier if I wanted gel I told him no, I don't feel that the high price of gel nails are worth it and I'm on a budget. I'm originally from Las Vegas we don't scimp on our hair our nails or anything like that and we know how to tip. I think this business needs to take a class on customer service as well as don't assume anything. I'm now going somewhere else.<//review>

This nail place has the most tolerant and brilliant artists in all of the valley. My girlfriend is the most stubborn and difficult women to work with in terms of nails but the people here make her fingers and toes look beautiful every time. If I could give more stars I would!</review>

< Review>
The workers are lovely people, who are really polite. There's great service, and the quality of their work (manis, pedis, wax) is amazing, my nails last weeks without any chipping and stay healthy after. I would definitely recommend this place to others, the shop is clean and the new owners are friendly. Understandably, most workers here don't speak English, but the owners are great translators too and manage pretty well during busy hours.

Also, I've been taking my friends here to get their nails done for events, they absolutely love it! Best nail salon in this area so far. I recently got acrylic nails (first timer) and I've had them for about a month, nails have grown, but no paint chipping nor any breakage! I'll be coming back soon!< /Review>

The person that did my acrylics did a horrible job the lighting in there is really dark so my nails looked ok when I got home I saw that she had left them superrrrr thick and under my acrylics I have acrylic stuck under that I cannot take off my nails , they are also all uneven, some are thicker then the others they look HORRIBLE and they charge me 40$ for something that I normally pay from 30-35$ at other nail places that do better jobs never going to a new nail person I do not recommend<//Text>

I was drying my nails and started noticing all of this and got upset and told him to fit it be fixed three of them and took off $5...I usually don't complain but I'll never be going here again!!!

< Review>
Worst Nail Shop I ever been to, the 2 men that did my pedicure and nails were to ruff, burned my skin and cut toenails down too low into my skin, gel polish was uneven and nails were too thick, it took over an hour, and they refuse to give a discount<//Review>

<review>I’m originally from the east coast and dining at Amici’s is always a special experience for me. The food is great! Highly recommend their meatballs and roasted broccoli, and you really can’t go wrong with any of their pizzas. We got the BBQ chicken and the New Haven Clam. Both hit the spot! The GM, Murillo, and his staff were all extremely hospitable as well.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe-2sL6Jg2FRDp3nsbKzO2gvHgLtHyAx4FP59n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMet9yeLMGTeE7NfYWcbqxkwni0jBYPHm1wnZGE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>{'time': 1621722725706, 'text': 'Hi Greg, thanks so much for sharing this great feedback!

Pizza is probably good but I don't eat pizza. I ordered salad and it was awful. Maybe cow can chew it because cow has a big mouth. Roman lettuce was chopped on big pieces.  Dressing was on the side and it was impossible to mix all ingredients evenly because of too big pieces. I prefer ready to eat salad and not mix it for $13!!
I experience the same in other restaurants and my patient was over.
Waitress was very nice.<//Text>

Flat out over priced horrible. Ravioli arrived in small container minus any sauce so sticky and dry. No bread or even side of parmesan cheese. Pizza by best just ok. Used to love Amici’s but can’t compare now to competitors.< /Review>

<name>AnG National Critics<//name><time>1613272941410< /time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Her favorite place..and its yet to disappoint her. The pizza is thin crusted and delicious. I am a native NYer and any pizza I have to  fold in half to eat is good pizza. The side chicken caesar salad is amazing (her words) I said it was great. She said I didn't give it enough credit. Skip the vegan bread sticks and add some calories by getting the cheesy sticks. They were good but the point of bread sticks is cheesy bread sticks. A large pizza, the salad and bread sticks at Amici's would feed a family of 4..and all for $53.00. If you are going through the east bay, give Amici's a shot.<//Review>< pics>

A bit too pricey. $40 for a very average large sausage, peppers, and onion pizza. On the plus side service was good and they were fast though.<//text>

Fantastic pizza.  Got it delivered to my hotel,  can only imagine what it tastes fresh and dine in.  Loved the marinara that I ordered with the breadsticks.  Honestly it was so good that the breadsticks were just a vehicle for the marinara.  The fresh basil on the breadsticks was a nice touch.

My one comment here is that my picky 8 year old that doesn't like pizza from anywhere ATE THE WHOLE SLICE.  You dont understand how hard it is to get her to eat, but Amici's got her to do what no other restaurant has managed to do.  Just in case you were wondering, she asked for seconds.< /review>

I've eaten at Amici's (SF, San Jose and Dublin) for many years. Always a good experience. Service is very good, friendly, efficient and inviting. Most often I have the pizza. Great crust that is the perfect balance of crispy and chewy. Doesn't matter what toppings you choose, they are all good. However I wouldn't choose more than 3 at a time personally as it is thin crust and could overwhelm if you have too many. The pastas, salads and breadsticks are all outstanding as well. I especially love the Lasagna. The marinara is one of my favorites around. Great spot in Dublin and great outdoor seating.<//text>

<Review>Amici’s has some solid pizza. Even more so if you enjoy thin crust. The salads, pastas, and bread are also really good. Staff is usually quick and polite and overall the restaurant is well kept.

This spots located in the Waterford Shopping center so don’t be shocked if finding parking near the pizzeria is difficult.< /Review>< pics>

My high school friends in Salt Lake were having a reunion this week. I was unable to go because of a health issue. I don't know how they knew Amici's was so good, but it was. Everything arrived hot and attractively packed. They ordered Minestrone soup, the best we have ever had! A beautiful salad with slices of salami, lots of grated mozzarella, yellow tomatoes and crisp, fresh Romaine lettuce. The pizza was made with spinach, tomatoes and mild sausage it was truly fantastic, AND White Clam Linguine, plus great soft rolls. The dessert was a fabulous Cheese Cake.
We are new to the area, but you can bet we will go to Amici's for dinner the next time we go out to dinner..
Thank you Amici's for a fabulous dinner. So nice my friends were thinking of us in this thoughtful way.  Donna and Frank Anselmo<//review>

We did order for my birthday and Fettuccine Alfredo (all time favorite pasta) was kind of a disaster.Others were not bad though
Vegetable pesto pasta - good one.
Veggie pizza - not so good.

Update: thanks Alexis, happy to see your reply👍

The food was so good..Caesar salad has the best dressing, good amount of garlic. I had the linguini and clams, but had it made with their pesto sauce...both dishes hit the spot. Definitely a great place...sad they closed the restaurant Downtown San Jose, but this place will do just fine !!<//Review>

<name>Rusty Lawrence<//name><review>Amici's is pretty dependable for great thin crust pizza.  Always a wide selection of fresh toppings, I am a fan of their pizza.  Sometimes plain, sometimes with a heap of ingredients on-top, it's hard to beat for a chain-type of operation.  Big plus for their delivery service as well.  When you don't feel like crawling out of the house (for whatever reason), their deliveries are consistently good.< /review><response>None</response><user>115075587612214684144< /user>< Rating>

I placed an online order.   When I arrived to pick up (they wouldn't deliver an order under $50) my order (which they said would be ready at 1832), I had to wait 15 minutes more.  By the time I arrived back at the Residence Inn (3.1 miles away), it was cold and soggy.  Not happy to spend $25 on a 10" pizza in that condition.   It was a Thursday evening,  not busy,  so not sure why this result.   I won't go back.<//review>

We had the minestrone soup and combo pizza. Both were good. Pizza is thin crust with just the right amount of topping. I  don't care for pizza that has so much cheese on it that it chokes you.</review>

They simply hire the lamest people on the planet.  1 1/2 hour wait and they cannot find me aster.giving them the hotel name, phone number, and address.  Avoid like the plague.< /review>

Good pizza although bit overpriced. I guess you're paying for the nice atmosphere and good ingredients.</Text>

<review>Had really great service. When we were done eating our server told us that our pizza had to be cooked a little longer than usual so they made up for it by not charging us for our drinks and gave us cheese cake on the house. It was a really great experience.</review>< pictures>

<review>I'm from Brooklyn and lived near two of the best pizza places in the country, so I'm very picky about my pizza. No pizza in California will ever compare, but I would say Amici's pizza is one of the best of the worst, but I mean that in a good way. I still prefer this place over many in the area. When you come here, be sure to stick to the pizza only. I went with my parents once and they decided to order chicken and meatballs which tasted like rubber and obviously frozen.< /review><username>Kristine Tutak< /username><GmapID>0x808fe9335f20dd9b:0xf568eab5ad93149a<//GmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>We had not ordered Amicis in a long time,  so we ordered a medium  pizza and an artichoke pancenetta salad ( the half size) delivered. The salad said it had capers, it had none. The pizza was rubbery and the crust was not the original thin crusty pizza. We were disappointed. Not to mention it was 50.00 with the.
Tip.

We could have had a nice steak dinner.

<Text>Ridiculously priced and nothing special.  10" veggie pizza was $17 and came out burnt. Spinach salad had potential but came with an oil/vinegar based dressing that was horrible. It was like I poured olive oil on my salad. The only good thing was they have me no grief in taking back and not charging us.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

It's greasy, really greasy. It's like sidewalk pizza you get in the city. It tastes awesome. Best pizza in the tri-valley. (To the person who said, "As with any other west coast east coast wannabe. This tastes nothing like "east coast" pizza." That may be so! But this is the west coast! Please rate subjectively, as how an impossible-to-obtain east-coast pizza tastes when we're in the WEST COAST is completely and utterly irrelevent. Relativity has got to be useful for something!)< /Review>

The best new york style pizza I've had so far in the Bay. Service is good, but not great, but pizza is 5 stars when the crust isn't burnt. The wings are also really good.</review>

<Text>Seriously? What can I say about Amici's Other Than "Forget About It" Raised on NewYork Pizza so I know pizza, and this is great pizza, I'm loving the thin crust and delicious toppings anchovies, and spicy Italian sausage are my favorites.They make a serious Spaghetti with Clam Sauce, thats it a small house salad, pizza, and the Spaghetti with Clam Sauce, OMG Forget about it! * * * * *<//Text>< username>

Our pizzas are meant to be baked to a darker, crispier finish than many other pizzerias, however you should never receive burnt pizza!\n\nThank you your valuable feedback, as it helps us prevent these issues in the future. If you are willing, we'd like to get some more information about your experience. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at alexis@amicis.com with the date of your order, the approximate time, the phone number you ordered with (if you ordered delivery), as well as the best way for our general manager to contact you directly. We take pride in our food & customer service and would love to make things right!\n\nThank you & we apologize again."}</response><Gmap_id>0x808fe9335f20dd9b:0xf568eab5ad93149a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Had an "okay" experience here. Greeting and desk service was very good. Nice employees. Food way better than expected. We liked the dry wings and garlic fries. Pizza was okay for the kids. Server was very friendly and attentive. The downside came when a pin somehow ended up on our lane and when we hit the "call attendant" button, we waited a good 10 minutes without an attendant coming. We eventually went to the front desk who helped us immediately. Have to mention, it wasn't busy at the time. Also, a lot of the games had network connection issues so the kids could not play them. The ticket redemption machine is really slow.< /text>

<Review>It's a very nice, clean, and fun environment. Pricing and deals are pretty sweet. The service I've received here has been amazing. The servers are very accommodating periodically checking to make sure everything is good(although there's a service button). They also have a small but rather decent selection of arcade games.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Great place to to bowl. Each game can have it's own theme which was really fun idea that it's custom to each lane. The food was great although some of the menu was pretty expensive. They have different days and times with different deals depending on when you go. The arcade was real fun, they have a medium sized selection of games.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dd4aa31b7da6c1:0x214f08aa5eb57e19</gmapID><user_id>115727651800049161591</user_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
One of the better bowling experiences. The place is a former AMF (the shoes, bowling balls, and other things still have AMF logos printed on them) but is still a unique enough experience.

Staff and service: Some are friendly and helpful, some aren't. So very hit or miss.

Food: Actually pretty good, for a bowling alley. Drinks are made well. We rented multiple lanes and we got unlimited drinks while we bowled. Loved the idea and it worked well!

Bowling: One of the best bowling experiences. The bowling balls are newer and better quality than most. Lanes are clean and maintained. Worth it to bowl here.</review>

<user>115442907523852501320< /user><Text>Most bowling alleys are dive bars with bowling. Bowlero is not that. It's nicely renovated, with modern features like touch pad ordering of food and drinks without leaving the lane. There's videos playing on large screens at the end of the lanes for the young people who don't have the attention span for a normal speed game of bowling. There's a decent little arcade and a pool table next to a full bar. It's a great option for a date night or group outing.</Text><rate>5< /rate><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

A bit pricey if you're a novice bowler and want to get better, but there are constant new deals available to practice, and if you're a casual bowler with a party group, this is your place to be. Drinks are your average LA prices but seem to kick a little harder than normal. My friends and I consistently get what we call the fish bowl and share it.

Good music, good atmosphere, very clean and great staff.</review>< userid>

This place is LIT🔥
For a bowling alley it has everything except a dance floor (and it should)!
Sunday night pricing is great. Great family spot.
Great date spot.
Drinks are heavy on the liquor, which is a good thing.
Food is good.
Fun place to go in Lomita.
Highly recommended. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾< /Review>

Great place for family and friends. The food is delicious especially the wings. The drinks are very good as well. The dunk tank (123 ounces) is a must. They don’t just having bowling but also a couple of fun arcade games and they also have billiards tables. Making a fun place for those that want a variety of fun things to do. They also have a special at 10pm, in which you pay and get to bowl for the rest of the night.<//Text>

<Text>Really great spot to go Bowling. I went during the evening around 8pm and they have unlimited bowling on Mondays, which was great because my buddies and I got to say there until they closed. The food was pretty good and the servings were good enough for 4 people. The staff was amazing as well because they were able to resolve an issue with our lane with in 3 minutes.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Neat spot, cute women working at the front desk,clean environment, there is a side bar that offers food. The food is nice and the bowling lanes are just perfect, you do share the same sit down area byt not the same bowling lane. I highly recommend this place to chill with a couple of friends.</Text></record>

<Text>First, it's very expensI've and secondly the lanes on HALF of the alley are well kept for league play but for general bowling, they put you on the OTHER half. Terrible. Lanes are not oiled, pins seem dead. Don't go here for recreational play!!!!!!!!!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This is a good spot.  On the right night, you'll get more than your money is worth. Look out for specials for the best bang for your buck.  I recommend bidding shoes because that adds up quickly.< /Text>

Our time here was well spent. We went for Fathers Day. The staff was informative and friendly. It was not crowded like Gable House in Torrance seems to be nowadays. The prices were fair for everything (food, socks, shoes). We had a good time. We would definitely go back. It does look a bit more run down than the new one in Westchester.< /review>

We visited this bowling alley for a kid's birthday party. The location was nicely decorated inside and in addition to the lanes they had a little arcade area and bar. I loved that they had a few options (bumpers, 6lb balls, and something to help you roll the ball down the lane) to assist kids with bowling.

The party food was not good in my opinion but I didn't expect much from a bowling alley. We had a good time.</review>

Had my son Birthday party and the service was impeccable food was delicious the drinks were amazing. This is my 3rd party at this facility, I come back because I know it will be a great hassle free experience. They have a giant burger called the Behemoth Burger its soooo good! Chicken was tasty and the sliders/fries were a hit at the party. I'm planning on having my Birthday here as well in June.<//text>

I love bowlero it has really cheap games on Sundays past 6 PM that would be the best time to go. They also have a full bar which is great and a random fireplace with real fire that’s very nice to sit next to. Sometimes the selection of bowling balls is a bit limited and the building can be a bit loud. They also have some decent arcade games that are newer and a really great bowling special for the summer for kids.</Review>

We had a great time there !! We went on a Groupon for a 2 hour family bowl fest. About 30 min in the power went out shortly then cam back on. They reset our 2 hour play time and we bowled on.
Would highly recommend Bowlero to all my friends and family!!
Great place!!< /text>

Also there is a lot of people hanging out in the parking lot smoking and drinking playing loud music not a good vibe. Lanes are ok there seating area is limited and the small round tables get in the way. Too hot in there as well need more air flow or something. Lanes too oily for me had to keep cleaning my ball< /Review>< rate>

<text>The good: The lanes are relatively new and seem to be well kept. Overall, they have decent quality. They have service straight to the lanes for food which not all bowling alleys do these days.

The bad: It gets very expensive very quickly. Drinks, games, and food are all overpriced in my opinion.

The pro shop left the location and they no longer have one.

As for the bowling lanes themselves, they seemed to be pretty over oiled every time I went.

Overall: Not the best but not the worst either. If you don't mind going to a bit older style bowling alleys, there are much cheaper alternatives nearby with friendlier workers.</text><gmapID>0x80dd4aa31b7da6c1:0x214f08aa5eb57e19< /gmapID>< date>

I went on a date here. There were a couple of people outside who were intoxicated but nothing a little management couldn't handle. They use a "Tab system" which caught me off guard, I just wanted to pay for the games upfront. The lanes were nice and clean and well stocked with balls of all kinds of sizes!! The shoes were exact size. Overall I had a great time there. Prices are a little high I spent 50.00 for shoes and 2 games for 2 people!!!</Review>

Had a great time! Place was nice, clean and good background music playing. Beth was our server and she was very sweet and courteous, the food was good. A little pricey for me, but, we will be going again‼️🎳🎶🍕</review>

I went on a date here. There were a couple of people outside who were intoxicated but nothing a little management couldn't handle. They use a "Tab system" which caught me off guard, I just wanted to pay for the games upfront. The lanes were nice and clean and well stocked with balls of all kinds of sizes!! The shoes were exact size. Overall I had a great time there. Prices are a little high I spent 50.00 for shoes and 2 games for 2 people!!!< /Review>

<Review>I had a blast here it was definitely a fun date although it is pricy $$ . The food also came cold had to send it back when the waitress brought it the second time it was still cold but at that point I was just over it still had a great time wouldn't mind coming back hopefully the next experience is better< /Review>< pics>

Cool venue and good selection of Arcade Games. Drinks were well made, tasted good, and were reasonably priced. Super friendly and helpful staff. The actual food was too salty and overpriced. Only reason why not 5 stars.<//Review>

I love it,  lots of parking, not crowded- we went on a wknd. Hint wear your own socks will save you $3.50 a pair, chicken salad was great, fries and chicken yummy.</Review>

We happened upon a Groupon for Bowlero- 2hrs bowling and show rental for 2 people. We thought it was great bc we love to bowl. It was a really good price and we ended up getting 6 games in! That's the most we've ever played at once. The staff was really nice, we had drinks and they were good, the atmosphere is nice, the shops seemed generally new. Overall it was just great. We had a nice time and it wasn't crowded which was the best!<//review>

<Text>The staff is always friendly. They play good music and over all just a pretty good vibe. Giving 4 stars though because I think it's a little over priced and the price increase seemed to happen over a couple of months. Last year, pitchers of Corona were $17, we went last weekend and they're $25 now. And the video games are pretty pricey too, especially when you have a 5 year old that loses every game in 2 seconds.< /Text><user_id>103105328123617159234<//user_id>< rating>

I had bad experience. They charged me for 4 people for 1hour bowling, unbelievable. I asked why too much? Something didn't understand. Didn't explain nothing. Be careful when you coming here, they charge crazy.< /Text>

Atmosphere is awesome, but their prices are too much. They don't post $ amount anywhere. So a credit card maybe needed by the end of family fun or that first date.</text>

The bowling part is cool. Unfortunately they don't have the automatic bumpers for the kids, like other Bowlero have. The service is really slow<//review>

<Review>Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it looks like they updated the place a bit and it looks a lot better. New arcade, pool tables etc. My only complaint was that it's very expensive to bowl here it cost me about 80$ for 3 shoe rentals and 3 games, yikes! 15$ for 2 drinks, some ice tea and a Sangria and I guess they only had one waitress/host to take orders for everyone that was bowling that afternoon since we didn't get any service till about our second game. Overall, the place looks a lot better but it is not cheap. Bring your own bowling shoes and you might save about 6$ per person.</Review>< Pictures>

The wings where great the drinks where good and my family had a blast.  They have good offers at the front desk.  Previous comment's stated food reviews but honestly if you want to dine out hit a restaurant. But the atmosphere at the location is awesome.</review>

<review>This place is great. And very resonable. The party package is very inexpensive and comes with unlimited pizza and drinks. You can't beat that. They have over 30 lanes. This place is rather large and has an arcade as well which us a double bonus. The food menu offers a large variety of options and if you are of legal drinking age that's an option here as well. And they have a variety of drinks on the menu not just beer and wine...<//review>< pictures>

Atmosphere is awesome, but their prices are too much. They don't post $ amount anywhere. So a credit card maybe needed by the end of family fun or that first date.</Review>

<text>My kids learned how to bowl here. It’s great, food is great especially the love me tenders with buffalo sauce. The bartenders are friendly and can make excellent well drinks. The micheladas or margaritas are bomb but mostly everyone comes in for the booze blue.< /text>< Pics>

Bowling with the family and it was cool. The place had good drinks and the food wasn't so bad either for a bowling alley. Lots of arcades, several billiards tables and Foosball as well for the non bowlers.<//Text>

Visited LA on business last week. I enjoy bowling back home, and since the other lanes I frequented on my last visit to LA was packed, took a drive out to Bowlero. Pretty good deal on Monday nights. Unlimited games plus shoes after 8pm I think for under 20 bucks. Wait staff was fantastic (made some new friends), atmosphere was perfect.. food and drinks were great. Went back 3 more times before my trip was over. All in all I will be returning on my next visit!< /text>

<Review>This place was definitely a step up from the traditional bowling alley, it was clean, good atmosphere, and pretty good food.  The only thing I didn't like was that the music was a touch loud for my tastes, I got a little hoarse trying to talk to the people in my party. Overall I enjoyed it though and would go back again.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dd4aa31b7da6c1:0x214f08aa5eb57e19< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had been there before in the past  they have redecorated. It really looks nice, the drinks were pretty good. I had a cucumber melonaid and had some garlic parmesan fries which were pretty good with ranch dressing.  I will definitely go back to bowl another time.</Review><name>Joely Simpson< /name><Rate>4< /Rate>< gmap_id>

Good lanes and cool place after the renovations but price was way to high. 100 bucks for 4 people 2 games. Maybe it's normal for some places but next time I'll look for another place.</text>

Visited LA on business last week. I enjoy bowling back home, and since the other lanes I frequented on my last visit to LA was packed, took a drive out to Bowlero. Pretty good deal on Monday nights. Unlimited games plus shoes after 8pm I think for under 20 bucks. Wait staff was fantastic (made some new friends), atmosphere was perfect.. food and drinks were great. Went back 3 more times before my trip was over. All in all I will be returning on my next visit!<//Review>

Took my brother for his 14 birthday it was a total if 20 of us. Had a blast, price for bowling was  decent. we ordered the giant burger, wings and the sampler. The giant burger looked awesome but the burger was very dry and not tasty, It was more for show, wings were ok. Food was overpriced for what we got. The restrooms were disgusting there was water all over the floor and the walls were all black and on top of that the lighting didn't help. I guess expected more for my money. I'll probably go back with some friends but with out the kids it gets really ghetto after 9pm lol.....</text>

Perfect place for a friendly get together. One of the staff members gave my group of friends 10 10$ game cards for waiting in line so long. On another note... I was eating at the bar and a man came in smoking a cigarette and the bartender didn't bother to tell him to put it out.. turns out he was her buddy. Very inconsiderate... and I'm  a smoker.< /review>

It's cool, but the games are kinda pricey. They open @ 4 on the weekdays. We like to bowl in the morning, so i cant come here. Other places give you a discount weekdays, mornings. The inside is nice and the bar area is huge. Just wish they would be open @9am like everyone else.

Didnt have the food, so no comment on that. The lanes are kept in good shape. New equiptment.

My biggest complaint is there are no ball racks anymore for the house balls. We bring our own equipment and the ball return is just cluttered with house balls. That is where they store all the house balls, right on the ball return.

So three stars for the bowling experience. 4 stars for the rest of the place. Yes, there is a small pro shop inside the building on the north side. The bar is great.<//Text>

<review>This place used to be AMF. Then it was updated and now it's bowlero. For the most part this place has benefited from the upgrade. The bowling lanes and balls are all new. They like to keep the music up kinda loud (at least on the Wednesday night that I went) but it didn't bug me. Might bother some people though. The food was decent. Best thing I had was the chicken fingers with the barbecue sauce. Those were kinda addicting. Not sure about pricing since I was there for a work party. Parking lowly was packed on a Wednesday night though so they must be doing something right. Only thing I didn't like was the fact that the arcade requires a prepaid card now. You can't just walk up with quarters and pay. So that's lame. Otherwise, recommended.<//review><Date>1516512557544<//Date>< username>

Too expensive. Two games for me and my girl was over $40. The place isn’t even that nice. I could have gone to lucky strike for that much and had my money’s worth. Not coming back here again, it’s a shakedown.</Review>

It was my first time being here and it was fun... the bowling prices are fair but I thought the food was a bit over priced... they have neon lights and movies and music playing which I thought was cool... they have a nice size selection of arcade games and a full bar.</Review>

Sometimes only 9/10 pins would be set up and sometimes the lane just wouldn't reset itself after bowling. Also, don't take kids at night. They play some pretty explicit music videos and really loud music.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I would say it was the worst experience that I could ever had in my entire life!! First of all, there was no line in front of the cashier except for the ladies who already paid. And that guy who were behind the cashier yelled at us to stay on the line... duh... So we kindly asked someone behind us whether they are on line just in case, obviously they were not. Anyway he kept avoiding us on purpose, one of the reasons for that was just because he's tired, He intentionally let in some people who came here after us. That part really pissed me off, and it was so obnoxious. But I just stayed calm, and didn't say anything, just because I didn't want to ruin my Friday night and wanted to stay out of trouble. Even though there was a line on his mind, that still does not mean that he can get the authority blocking us getting in. He also had a chance to explain but apparently he didn't, with that serious face If he had a personal issue on that day, he shouldn't have brought it to the working place!!<//Text>

Most expensive place ever we played 2 games with myself and my 3 boys and I even had $20 off, I still paid 60. They charge per game each player. Nice place but not for those prices.</Text>

<review>Looking for the best bowling alley in the South Bay? Got kids?  Even better!(My 7, 8, and 15yr old all LOVE Bowlero!  Why?  It's more than just a bowling alley!  Plenty of lanes and food is even GREAT, Full Bar, service always good too...

Here's the best part:  There's a (modern) arcade with GIANT versions of popular touchscreen IPhone/Android games!  Also, Super Mario Kart Deluxe is AWESOME(using pedals, gear shifter, steering wheel etc.  Oh,  there's also half dozen or so rows of "skeeball" and other classic ticket winning games like Free-throw basketball, a big Air hockey table&lots more!

Not expensive(Sat there's a free live DJ jammin and Sunday is super cheap(family night from 5-9pm, discounted everything, $1 shoes, super cheap games(I forget all discounts but its cheap).

You could just bowl too, order cocktails and food but I always get a gamecard too and it gives discount more you spend $25 for $20 and $55 for arcade for $40 and can earn prize tickets for the kids from playing games (cash in tickets won on card for prizes&stufffor the kids mostly(I hit a jackpot for my basketball scores and had over 2,400 tickets!!  Actually got a VR headset AND like 15 small things lol But theres lots of cool prizes for like 10 or 25 tickets like punching bags& Random toys.

HIGHLY reccomend Bowlero Torrance!! Saturday DJ is loud for some younger kids though but Sunday is quiet and way cheap!

We've gone 4-5  times and always have a blast. Reasonably priced, modern, safe and just GREAT for all ages and especially for big groups!  Highly reccomended by us and our neighbors go alot too!  PV bowl is ok too BUT no good unless you ONLY wanna drink&bowl with no kids.  Overall Bowlero is WAY funner and best bowling alley ever for me and luckily its only a mile away!!</review><gmapID>0x80dd4aa31b7da6c1:0x214f08aa5eb57e19</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They really helped me out with the Summer Pass when headquarters wouldn't. Was charged online and never issued a Pass number. Best to go early afternoon as it gets busier during the evening.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>I purchased a coupon from groupon and decided to use it last weekend on a Saturday (3pm) it was for 2 hours of bowling for 4 people for 33 bucks which I thought was a amazing deal, upon arriving at amf bowl in torrance the outside looks dry and empty like no one was there once I walked inside it was pretty decent nice lightning nice music, rental shoes was very new and comfortable, the only thing that brother me was the drinks very overpriced 4 beers came out to a total of 35 bucks wow we could have got a case of beer and liquor for that prices, but we all enjoyed the venue and would go back again but will not buy drinks .. lol< /text>< pics>

The worst customer service! Giselle,lady in the front desk, has perhaps the worst attitude. She is extremely rude and is inconpetent to perform basic job duties.</Review>

Hold Up! Our kids went bowling this Saturday night 12/30/17 and these people had the nerve to charge them double! 5 teenagers bowled 2 games and were charged for 9 people for 2 games it came to $164 Not including the shoes. The assistant manager Chistian Singer refused to refund any portion of these charges.  It is disgraceful to take advantage of people like that!
You should be ashamed of yourselves!<//text>

This bowling ally is lit but that is not the AMF. The real AMF is the american monkey foundation. Hopefully that is what it stands for but if it is not then the monkeys in the american monkey foundation would attack and it will Rise of the Planet of AMF so that being said, you must do it for Harambe'.<//text>
