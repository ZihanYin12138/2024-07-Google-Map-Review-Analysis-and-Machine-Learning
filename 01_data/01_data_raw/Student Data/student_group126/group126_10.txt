This is one of the Worst Place to go for Hair Curling. The owner named LAILA has the worst customer service. My wife been calling them for very week to fix her hair but she refused to take responsibility. She Charged my wife a 100$ but demaged her hairs. I would suggest everyone not to go there and stay away from them.</Text>

<Text>I had my hair rebonding here with Reeta, she's nice but got my hair messed up. I wish she could offer a better treatment for my hair. My hair is naturally straight but after i had my baby it was frizzy and dull so decided to come here. After the rebonding that she did my hair was damaged, it was like curly and dull. She offered a deep conditioning, it was better but not until my hair gets dry. She even asked me to buy some products that help a bit but it was a total damaged. I went to other salon they told me the same thing that she really messed up my hair. i was suppose to come back for another deep conditioning but i found some treatments products in sephora.I rather use them. Don't want to come back there anymore.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

So upset with this place I wish I could give it half a star. They basically charged me $30 to wash my hair and sent me on my way.. no blow dry no style nothing. My stylist tried making things better by giving me a trim.. I didn’t come into your salon wanting my hair cut I wanted a treatment and style. All salons I’ve been too before would never let a Clinent leave the salon with wet unfinished hair. Blow dries never have an additional cost at any REAL hair salon I’ve been too. Very unprofessional. Never coming back here again.</text>

And plus she threads and waxes my eyebrows and does a remarkable job on them. I let very few people do them and she is one awesome women. All of her staff is amazing and kind,generous and these ladies know what they are doing and they do a awesome job doing it....so ladies if your looking for an awesome place DESIGNER CUTS is the one.<//Review>< pics>

Used to be a good place. Now ran by rude people that make you wait behind people who were not there before you were if all you want is a haircut and they want a perm. Won't go back ever again.< /text>

I had a great experience at Designer Cuts with Laila. I told her exactly what I wanted and she was able to make it happen! So so happy with my color! Had a bad experience at another salon but I'm glad I have this salon a chance!< /review>

<Text>This place deserves a BIG FAT ZERO. I never write bad reviews...but this place was beyond horrible. I showed a picture to the hairdresser Rita what I exactly wanted done..i asked her numerous times can you do This? Of course she replied yes absolutely. So I proceeded with the color (I went blue black ) told her do not cut the length instead you can add some layers. But KEEP MY LENGTH. Oh wait forgot To mention that prior to this appointment she had told me I would pay $40 for color and 15 for cut I was charged $75 when I left... Why i have no clue. The color came out good. But why in the hell did my hair cut look like a Bob? Yes she cut 4-5" off my hair!! I went home and straighten my hair because she never styled it after she was done. I called Rita right away to tell her that she took off way too much off my hair. She said no straighten it it's longer. After going back n forth I went back there to show her. Of course she denied the entire thing and had thevnerve to say is that the picture you showed me know I remember you telling me cut it as short. So unprofessionally handled Instead of owning up to her mistake she kept arguing and saying that if you straighten it and will be longer? seriously?! She had another client there and she was telling her about the whole thing making hand gestures and pointing at me while talking mess in her language. The client was giving me dirty looks. She never came back-to talk to me and mind you I was very respectful how to been someone else things would have been different. I told her to give me Her Manager's number so I can tell her the situation. Nothing was done and no one called me please if you need to get your hair done I suggest you go somewhere else. Never in my life would I go here ever again.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

She did a nice job on my eyebrows and was nice enough to give me my groupon rate. I only gave one less star because I have to actively participate and I feel ignored by staff walking in, left to wait an indeterminate amount of time. But they have always taken me last minute, pretty much a walk-in, so thats nice - and I've only been there twice. i would still recommend it.<//Review>

<review>If I could give this place a zero I would. We went inside the lady was doing someone's eyebrows. I told her he needed a trim and she said ok. There was no other customers there. When she finished with the customer she walked to the back and ate. She sat there ate her food.  I was looking at her a small she waved then continued to eat. We left. Horrible experience. I do not suggest.<//review>< Rate>

I have a full size truck. The drive in to the car wash designed poorly, can't maneuver in first attempt without rubbing on the curb! Drove through the car wash and parked right in front of it to dry out the remaining spots, and in front  of my eyes I see, how  chemicals they use, left  stripes on the paint! The paint on the truck is ruined, and owners just shrugged their shoulders! Never again! Don't even think about washing Your vehicle there!<//review>

Very small convenience store. Right off freeway so it's convenient, but Silva's gas has better prices. The carwash never seems to work well enough to clean the car.</Text>

Expensive gas private owned. Car wash gimmick 20. Cents less with wash purchase but price of wash vs savings this time of year, (summer). Never balances in your favor. But quick state of the art ghetto wash. Keeps me coming back every 2 weeks lol</Review>

CARWASH IS MISSING THE ROLLER BRUSHES!! Only water and soap will be sprayed on your car without any scrubbing, and thats how they expect you to accept this service once you've prepaid for it at the pump.</text>

<Text>NEGETIVE 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!

There is a very rude lady working at the counter.

I don’t usually write reviews let alone bad ones but boy do I feel its necissary!

I stopped here because my check engine light went on and I wanted to add oil to my car. I went in the store purchased two slushees for my kids. I went out and checked my oil and my kids straw broke. So I went back in the store and grabbed another straw and this crazy woman started yelling at me like if I were doing something illegal or as if I were stealing a damn straw from her personally. It was very embarrassing, there were other people in the store and it was completely unreasonable. I answered “excuse me” and she continued yelling saying that I need to ask her for a straw... and so then I told her I wanted to speak to her manager and she immidiety told me to leave so violently I felt I had to. I left and as called the corporate office. I hope she gets fired. I’m not going to return to this chevron, if I do, I hope I don’t see her there. It would be very upsetting.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

<Review>It's a gas station. That's all. I usually go to a different Chevron. The people behind the counter at this one always look preoccupied or like they think I'm gonna steal something. If I go there, I just pay at the pump and go.<//Review>< user>

The store is clean and we'll stocked, everything from meat to medicine. The managers and cashier's speak multiple languages and are easy to get along with. Great store reflects the quality of the city San Joaquin</text>

I arrive at this marvelous  restaurant many times since I like the special air that is unique to this place. The personel is very cordial and well trained. The service is impressively rapid. Needless to say, the food they serve is highly distinguished. I frequent many times and I was always delighted. The price is modest. I highly suggest this restaurant to my friends and family.<//Text>

Reviews for this place are questionable at best. It's a cheaper version of Panda Express. The orange chicken was fine but the oil they used wasn't fresh by any means and the sauce was definitely sweet but lacked any serious flavor. The broccoli beef was fine but the broccoli was overcooked and cut haphazardly making for some awkward side-of-the-mouth bites.

They heap the thick-noodle chowmein on, but it's just mediocre too. Everything here is was you might expect with the added twist of being a little too affordable.  I'd go back if I only had ten dollars in my wallet and refused to eat from the nearby fast food places.<//Review>

<Review>They have all the offerings that you'd expect from a typical fast Chinese food restaurant at moderate prices. However, I did not enjoy their food: the fried rice was bland even with soy sauce, orange chicken tasted OK but very soggy. Although, their veggie egg rolls were average. I suggest passing on this one and looking into much tastier alternatives nearby.< /Review>< pics>

Well everything had eye appeal. But when tasting the food it had a taste of greasy food that had been sitting under the lamp all day. The bread coating that is used to coat their meat is very thick & like corn meal. The chicken garlic is gross. The garlic was burnt & bitter. I recommend Panda Express where the food is cooked fresh & the crowd is happy & content.<//review>

The food here was honestly disgusting! Just came from here a hour ago since I was on my break but it was just a big disappointment! Orange chicken was super dry with weird flavor , rice was simple as hell , beef and broccoli were salty as hell. $7 for nothing! Don't go here guys. Place looks old as hell too they have to remodel .<//text>

<Review>Poor customer service, high prices, unorganized. Walked in and explored the shop. Not once was I asked if I needed anything. I was the only customer in the store. I try to support small business when I can, but when they ignore you as you walk in the door, I'll take my business elsewhere.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I needed parts for a old Homelite generator and a Montgomery Wards rototiller both with Briggs and Stratton 5 hp. Engines, and they were very helpful and had the parts I needed to get them both running good. Their prices were fair and the parts I needed they had in stock. Thanks guys for the help. Other places I tried that were closer to me didn't even want to bother with helping me. Gentleman Glen.< /review>

<time>1563570283636< /time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>I’m not sure how they have soo many raving reviews. These guys are a total rip off. I had my trimmer taken in to have the blades sharpen. Came back totally unusable. Took it back and the customer service was complete shh. All of a sudden I had to pay again to get it checked out. The guy even walked away when I call him out on their BS. My business was no longered valued and he plainly walked away from me.This place is the absolute worst.

I took the same trimmer to a different company and guess what!? These guys over tighten a bolt, pretty much breaking the trimmer. They didn’t event have to touch any of that.

You guys should be ashamed of your ethics and the way you disregard people after the fact.

To everyone else. Do yourself a favor. Go support other shops.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Dr. Raymond is the best!! He not only takes care of my fur-babies but also all of my family's pets. He has been the most amazing vet we could ask for on an every visit basis but he also saved our cat's life when no one else could. We highly recommend Placerville Animal Wellness!</Text>

I concur with all the praise for Dr. Raymond and his wonderful staff. I trust no one more than Dr. Raymond for the care and advice he provides to me about my precious pets. And he does so with compassion and without the slightest hint of greed for money by prescribing unneeded treatments or medication. Long live Dr. Raymond. Love PAWS to the max!< /text>

Very Friendly staff and  the main vet.Dr. Is very good with his knowledge and treatment plans fir your pets. Prices are very fair and would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to find a trustworthy vet to take thier pets to. I also like the fact that he takes walk in appointment's from 4pm till about 5:30pm the days  thier business is open.  Makes it very convenient. Over all I give 5 stars plus on this veterinary clinic .< /text>

Came back after 2years . Lot better clinic environment. The assistants in the office were very polite and nice unlike the office person 2 years ago  who was obnoxious and hard to work with..

<Review>If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be able to care for any pet. They are the absolute best! The Veterinarian, on a scale of 1-10,  He is definitely a 15! I have never known  anyone who works there to be anything but nice, caring and patient. (Even with older people, who need it most) not that I'm old. Lol ok, a little. I would recommend this place to everyone.  They put your pet before money!<//Review>< response>

He has been wonderful to my baby girls and has done surgery on several of them over the years with no issues. His depth and breadth of knowledge plus his experience is second to none.

He is so good with animals and everytime I take my girls, I am in awe of his way with them. They trust him too!  I would happily pay 2X as much for his services if I needed to. I am so grateful to have him as our vet. Love him and his staff.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809a5710b5ce34af:0xc98a34def04b6f5</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Helpers of animal and humankind alike, Dr, Raymond and his staff at Placerville Animal Wellness embody the qualities that make the world a better place.  Generous beyond measure, you needn't spend much time there to understand his mission- exemplary service with compassion and dignity for all.   We were referred to Dr. Raymond when our beloved cat was gravely injured, due to multiple rattlesnake bites.  With the utmost of care and treatment by Dr. Raymond, she is recovering and still with us.  Dr. Raymond's time, care, effort and generosity with our cat fills our hearts with joy and gratitude.  I am reminded of a quote by St. Francis, Patron Saint of Animals..."Start by doing what's necessary, then do what's possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible".  Thank you Dr. Raymond, for making the seemingly impossible, possible.  The world is a better place with you in it.< /review>< Pictures>

What a horrible experience.  The receptionist "office manager " was so rude and very unprofessional.  I cannot believe her lack of empathy concerning our 16 year old dying dog. I was hung up on three times because she refuses to listen and talks over me. I wanted to make a complaint about her lack of customer service and the disregard we got when calling in. She is the "office manager " and my complaint was about her so I asked to talk with the doctor and she said she would need to know what its concerning so she could pass the info along. I think her name is Lori? Anyways she asked my complaint, I tried many times to tell her and she talked over me. arguing with me, and then hung up!!! I'm sure the doctor will never know about this encounter as she probably won't share with him my complaint of her terrible attitude. But I do hope he sees this. Dr. You really need someone who can be caring and has customer service. She is running people off with her bad attitude.  I know if it was my business I would want to know.</Text>

They took us in no prob, no appointment, and no call.  We waited for them to open and they took us rite away. Found a few problems in my girl dog and swiftly took control.    Thank you so much for everything and putting me at ease.  My hat's off to Dr. Raymond. A great place for animals!</Review>

This doctor has the best prices around. And he's fast. If you're looking for a doctor to sit and chat with you about all the neurotic things you feel about your pet this is not the place to go. But for cheap quick and friendly service this is the place for you. Dr. Raymond will answer any neurotic questions that you have through his email and he responds quite quickly. Dr. Raymond figured out how to service the community in the most effective way< /Text>

Very pleased, they got us right in. They were all very kind and loving with our Dog. They made sure I was fully aware of any fees. And, this is the first time in my life I've gotten out if a Vet office for under $100< /text>

<review>Dr. Alton Raymond is the best vet.  He is so very caring, compassionate and knowledgeable taking time to explain what is going on with my cats.  My Cocoa lived to 22 years thanks to Dr. Raymond diagnosing a slight thyroid condition and when he couldn't tolerate the pills, we turned to Grandpa's Compounding Pharmacy to create an ointment to put on his ear to get the thyroid med.  He is a true angel to the many animals he cares for at his clinic. His receptionist, Laura, and all the other staff put your pet first.<//review>< pictures>

Walking in here, I noticed that this place had a very calm, safe energy. It wasn't scary for my dog to come in. She is a pretty nervous dog, and she wasnt bothered at all. The staff was all very nice and welcoming. Dr. Raymond was incredibly gentle with her and made her feel safe. He explained to me how easy it could be to rack up a very large bill doing testing (like over $1500 in one day), so he didn't want to do any unnecessary tests. He came up with what he thought would be the most important and informative tests to start figuring out what was wrong with my dog, and gave me a price that was as low as he could go without losing money himself. He seems to be a very compassionate, caring person. I would recommend this office 1000x over. You wouldnt regret coming here.<//Text>

I am so disappointed.  Took my 10 year old pit in yesterday.  Receptionist was so rude made us wait outside because he was crying. His belly is bloated. Doctor said he is constipated.  He has round worms. Didn't even check him really. 72 $ later and now I'm going to get him de-wormer. We definitely will not go back. I understand the discount prices now. They don't really examine the fur babies.< /Review>

This is not my regular vet but I have been using PV Animal Wellness Clinic more and more over the past few years. Dr. Raymond is a compassionate animal care giver and has done an awesome job on several animals we've brought in. He also cares much about people in order to provide affordable care visits to people when the typical veterinary office charges $50 just to see your pet. I highly recommend his office to anyone. He takes great care of pets! Thank you Dr Raymond for coming to Placerville.< /review>

I took my 1 year pit mix, she is terrified of everything and everybody and barks to try to appear scary. She has never hurt anyone. The vet did not greet her but instead pulled her back legs to try and get her to lie down. She did not like being manhandled and started freaking out. The vet refused to see her because she was too aggressive even though he was the one being aggressive. The receptionist and other staff there were very kind and I appreciate them for that. I plan to find a vet who will actually try and get to know my dog before shoving her to the ground. Definitely not reccomending this place to anyone.<//text>< name>

Hours are for walk-ins. They close a little bit after the times listed. We received high quality and affordable care from Dr. Raymond. He may have added another year to our time with our aging cat. Renal failure will probably take him, but Dr. Raymond dealt swiftly and aggressively with what he suspected and confirmed to be an aggressive, cancerous growth. We would have had to put him down before he was ready with the prices and inefficient services our regular vet was piling on while the growth only grew and the risk for spreading increased. Thank you, Dr. Raymond!<//text>

<Text>I believe Dr. Raymond at the Placerville Animal Wellness Clinic is a gifted veterinarian. He just seems to instinctually know what needs to be done to help your pet. Our cat, Kiko, disappeared for several days and when he returned he was dehydrated and could hardly stand up. He was a very sick cat. I took him to Dr. Raymond and he suspected a viral infection. He treated him and then stayed in contact with us the entire time Kiko was healing. I have no doubt he saved our cat.  Thank you Dr. Raymond. You are a real asset to our community.<//Text>< Pictures>

I would like to encourage any one who has a dog with a back/spine/ disk problem to visit Dr. Raymond to discuss alternative accupuncture treatments. We brought our 9 yr.old mini-dachsund to Dr Raymond after 3 visits to our usual vet yielded no results for a sudden back end paralysis that happened when our dog ran down 2 porch steps, let out a pain yelp and could not lift up his back end! The original vet took X-Rays, "found nothing" and offered to refer to a neurology vet for possible surgery ($1,000+ for diagnostics + $5,000+ surgery) Over the past 3 weeks, Dr Raymond did 3 accupuncture Rx's- after each Rx, there was marked improvement starting the very1st day after the 1st Rx!!! Our dog now walks bearing weight/moving all 4 legs! His gait improves daily! Dr. Raymond rates so high on our list!!!- Thank You!!</Text>

Paid for the "Diamond" car wash. $29.99 in cash. They never said why they could not take credit or debit even though the y clearly had the equipment still. Had to ask the detailer to clean the door panel pocket whole on the door panel armrests. They didnt clean my rear window on the inside. They didnt clean the whole front windshield on the outside. You could clearly see the area outside of windshield wiper area with the built up dirt after the car wash and detail. Not sure about you but I will never waste my money going back.</Text>

It's a great place to stop by if! You don't mind standing I'm line for 20-30 mins ( no joke) cashier looks and acts like she just smoked a pound of top shelf and don't mind the junkie coming in and out with no shirt and his pants half off and to the owners a special thank you from us who purchased lottery tickets from you which are not even activated PLEASE DON'T GO THERE ITS WELL WORTH IT TO GO ONE MORE EXIT DOWN THE FREEWAY!</text>

<Review>Horrible place to get a car wash. Bought the luxury wash and noticed they had three guys using the same dirty rags they just used on the car in front of mine to wipe down the outside AND inside my car! I had a set of lock keys,  chapstick, and Listerine strips in the drink holder. The fat balding guy had both the keys and the strips in his hand and called himself "wiping" them outside the car until he noticed he was being watched and he returned them back inside.  The items didn't need "cleaning" nor to be outside the car! They could've been put on the seat; the cup holder wiped and the items put back. They didn't wipe down my center console; pathetically wiped down my dashboard AND left a big CRACK in it! Didn't bother to acknowledge the damage or to take responsibility. That's what you get for having a certain level of expectations from half-@$$ed, low-skilled, and unqualified employees. NEVER GOING BACK!!</Review>< Pictures>

The car was still dirty, smudge marks and fingerprints on the windows. The car smelled like an old rag. The roof of the car was not washed and the tires were not clean. We ended up washing the car AGAIN once we got home.</review>< pics>

<text>Great place to get your car washed. The owner is a very friendly man, he's even very well loved by the less fortunate ( homeless) of whom he has gone out of his way to ocassionally buy food from Carl's Jr next door to hiis business.<//text>< Rating>

I think that the owner is more concerned about washing cars than keeping up maintenance on his gas pumps and restrooms. For as many years that I have been stopping there just to get gas, the restrooms have been in shambles and smell horribly. The gas pumps are falling apart literally and he has to cover his underground tanks with floor mats because he can't keep the water out of the gas tanks. I don't know what this person who owns this gas station is waiting for, but I've heard stories of past owners who have taken care of the place before the current owner. Makes no sense that you want to take care of people's cars by washing them but you don't want to take care of your own place.<//review>

<Time>1441926322546< /Time><rate>1<//rate><text>Took my truck to have washed. Even paid extra because it is a truck. I always keep my vehicle very clean and tidy, but I do have a dog that sheds and have never had a problem vacuuming up the hair; car washes have never had a problem either. I did tell the attendant that there was dog slobber on the window and they would have to roll it down to clean at the top. I didn't think to say anything about the hair, because there wasn't a lot of it and it has never been a problem for my regular car wash. When they were done, I got in and left, didn't think to look. I rolled down my windows, and goop was still on the windows. No big deal, I figured I would clean them when I got home. I'm cleaning my windows and that is when I noticed they didn't bother to vacuum the back seat or the floor. In fact, they didn't bother to vacuum between the seats, or wipe down anything. I returned to the car wash to have them vacuum and was told they only vacuum all of the vehicle if it is being 'detailed'... and that they would have to pick at the hair with their fingers. In fact, he argued with me. Serious? He said this like I had no idea how a vacuum works, as if I have never personally washed and vacuumed my own car. I don't know about them or their equipment, but I have never had to 'pick' the hair with my fingers, the vacuum has always done just fine picking it up. Even my house vacuum with hose attachment. Over all, it was a lame attempt to excuse their laziness and service. I will not, ever, go back to them.</text>< Pictures>

Took my 2018 Honda Accord sport here they did a terrible wash and scratched all four of my rims. Their employees were very rude and tried to say my rims were already in that condition. My vehicle has less than 1k miles on it and I’ve had it for a month. I would avoid this car wash. I paid extra for a side wash and they still put it through the machine that caused the scratches on my rims. TERRIBLE SERVICE DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Definitely not worth the $23 I paid for a my carwash. I'd give it 3 stars if I paid $10. I get my car washed weekly so my car really isn't that hard to clean up.
Vacuum job was super lazy and quick, no effort whatsoever. My car was not wiped down inside properly, spots of the spray they used were on my interior because he didn't wipe it.
When he called me over I opened my trunk because I saw they didn't wipe it down and a ton of water came out (that's why you open the trunk and wipe the inside).
I went back home and wiped all the bird poop spots up because there were still quite a few not cleaned up and super easy to spot when you are drying the car. I think they use hard water because I have water spots on my car as well. Again I get my car washed weekly and it really is hard to maintain an already clean car but this place is just nowhere near decent for the price you pay and the time you have to wait.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Well I been there a few times I would have to say the car wash needs to step up there game I took my truck and wives car to wash we didn't  like it at all, the job seems half a$$ed. And was disappointing to see how a job it was there wasn't a long line so the workers couldn't been too much in a hurry but that was the last straw I won't be going ever again. The seats still dirty the interior was not  Armoralled such as doors cluster and dash I paid for the good car wash and they failed . A tip for those who do decide to go just get the 14.99 and it the same as the 30 dollar one<//review>

They always get my truck wet and then leave it out in the sun until there are water spots all over and then go back and try to touch it up. Plus they usually skip things that most people won't notice, like the back window. If it's not sunny or if you have the only vehicle they're cleaning then it's worth going here especially since it's cheap, otherwise stay away<//Text>< Pics>

I was recommended to this car wash and gas station by one of my friends who happened to be one of Colton's finest. I was supprised when I drive into the facility which is right in front of the Wal Mart Center. This is a first rate car wash with a gas station, beautiful store with glass doors all around. The NEW management wisely retained all of the experienced car care staff including Roberto, the manager with over 30 years of experiences in car detail. My car was in and out in about 20 minutes, and I am pleased with the services, and will be back for Roberto's recommended detail work. I wrote this review on my laptop at one of the table for guests, using the available free wifi drinking my free cup of coffee. If you want a relaxed place to have your car professionally taken care of at an affordable low price, this is the place.</text>

Dissatisfied! I paid $16 bucks for my car wash knowing I was getting a basic full service and what I got was a half ass service. They didn't wipe down anything on the inside of the car and didn't look vacuumed out. I will not come back here.</Text>

Don't know why I keep coming here (yes. I do, because it's close by).  Always do a very poor job, leaving water spots streaks.  Aways forget the air freshener that I pay EXTRA for.  Horrible place.< /Review>

this company is one of the best storage units I've ever been with. The staff is friendly helpful and always available when I need answers to any of my questions. The maintenance is excellent and the area is clean. It's easy to come back and forth whenever I need to, and there's no worry for me about potential theft or break-ins,because of the lock system they use. I highly recommend this facility to anyone that needs a place to store their goods.<//Review>

<Text>My boyfriend and I had a positive experience at the Los Banos location. Tim, the guy in the front desk went out of his way to go above and beyond getting us into a very clean & great priced storage unit. Tim was very respectful & had the best customer service I've seen in LB. We will be using this place for future purposes. If you're looking for a safe & reasonable priced storage unit, this is the place to go. Once again thank you Tim @ StorQuest you're awesome!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Great customer service. They go above and beyond always looking in ways to help to keep my unit clean and up to date. If issue's come up with the unit they get it fixed ASAP. I have had my unit for a few years and my business has expanded and now getting our second unit with them.  Would highly recommend.<//Review>

<Time>1560888657879<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>When I got to the StorQuest Self Storage I had chatted with the staffer who explained in detail what was available and the services provided. He set me up to hold the unit I was interested in and a few days later I got the unit. The day I arrived to get the unit officially, they were a man down, with the regular staffer out and the front desk was being covered by their maintenance man, who tried his dang best to take care of me... without hesitation he called in a manager who arrived quickly and with barely a wait, I had my unit and was ready to pack my stuff in their space.

Entry and exit is a breeze, the hours are clear as a bell as to when you can come and go, and they have cameras ALL OVER THE PLACE.

It's a top-notch run organization and this location in Los Banos was quite the great experience.<//text>< Pics>

Wow. Really surprised by your employee Marshall. From the moment I arrived this man not only helped my wife open the door so she could get the stroller in he was polite and made our move so much easier the  we expected it to be. He was friendly and kind and gave us beyond great customer care then we could've asked for. This man is literally one of the nicest individuals we have met so far in Los Banos. Thank you again Marshall for your great customer service. Much appreciated.</text>

Came here same day needing the biggest storage unit they have & they set us up right way even the day before Christmas Eve. Isabel at the front desk made signing up super quick and easy for us & Damon helped us out as well and told us all about the units and the best way to pull in our trailer and load everything easily. We moved everything from our three bedroom home in one day & they helped us get all of our things in, within two hours. Great customer service we were super happy with it.<//Review>

I have used your facility and encouraged many to use your storage facility. I was referred and told to ask for marshal. It was a pleasure to meet him. When ever I go to my unit he makes it a point to say hi. I am retired and disabled veteran. I also had a very successful business  which I later sold to a NFL football player. Marshall is a great manager. He takes his job very seriously . If he was not there I would probably not be there. His helper is also a great guy.< /Text>

Awesome establishment. Staff are super friendly and helpful.  So glad I chose StorQuest,  almost ended up next  door with the rudest  manager I've ever met!!! Definitely  dodged a bullet.  Marshal  helped me,  he is super cool, super friendly, and most importantly super helpful. So glad I chose this facility.<//Text>

I had an email AND a phone call within a minute of my request, and the followup has been excellent. Katie, Isabelle, and of course, Marshall the Manager have made the entire process move quickly and smoothly. The outside appearance of StorQuest is well maintained, the office organized, and the unit we received very clean inside. We are looking forward to a long relationship with all of them.</Text>< Pics>

I just got into town and I'm currently looking for a storage unit. I spoke with Marshall who was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions. I told him I was still in the process of getting everything in order and that I'd get back to him. He wasn't pushy and said he'd be there for me if I have any other questions. Awesome service!</text>

<Review>Big Big Thank You to both Isabel and Damon for making it happen for me. Isabel took the time to explain what was available and what was soon to be available. They understood how much we needed a storage unit today because we were put in a bit of a situation. They had one unit becoming available later today and already knew that they were going to call me right away to offer me the unit. They have honestly provided awesome customer service to me and also made my almost frustrating day and very Happy Day!!!!

WOW! I have been dealing with Storage Quest for YEARS from out of town. Marshall, who seems to run the place is fabulous, you would think he owned the stuff in storage, he cares that much. Recently, they hired property management company.....I thought that was the end of the personalized care from Marshall. I was wrong. We had a big problem with the unit and my elderly mother paying it on time, by the time, I got to it, it was out of control. I called Property Management and I felt like I was talking to my sister. She not only listened to me but help us greatly. I cannot say enough good things about Storage Quest in Los Banos California. THANK YOU.< /review>

This facility rocks!! Very friendly & helpful staff, always clean, and well maintained. By far the best storage place in town!! :-)

Update: I went around and out of town to look at various storage facilities today, and I still love this place the most!! Storquest is amazing, and Damon is very helpful. He was nice, thorough in answering my questions and made me feel important! I will definitely be staying with Storquest thanks to him.</review>

I'm a tenant here at StorQuest in Los Banos California and I just have to say that the gentleman by the name of Marshall who works at this facility as one of the most nicest helpful and friendliest people I have ever come across he went out of his way to help me he even came in on his day off to make sure that the problem I was having was taken care of I really appreciate his help and I would recommend this storage facility to anybody in need of one just ask for Marshall he's the best..< /Text>

I was having a hard time finding a storage in town. I walked into storquest and a young lady named Isabel was so sweet, very respectful and knew a lot about the units. Her smile and her customer service is what made me want to rent a storage. I enjoyed my time with Isabel at storquest in los banos</review>

I thought tbe place was a good location and was pretty clean. I didnt like all those cameras looking at me, but its good for security.  The grounds keeper Damon was very attentive to us and made sure we gotwhat we needdd on a timely manner and also directed us to our unit. He helped make my wife and I chhose this Storage Facility.  I eould recommend it.</Review>

Marshall was absolutely wonderful to me. I pulled into Los Banos July 4th of 2016 and when we got there, he was the first one to welcome us into town. The first thing I noticed was this huge philadendron sitting on the counter... And I love plants so I asked if I could have a clipping. Well I kept that darn thing and still have it and it's Huge!!! Oh and we named it Marshall, it seemed only right lol well... We decided to move back to Washington August 3rd of 2017. Thank you for being so kind and understanding and having patience. We really appreciated doing business with you. I wish more people were as friendly. Keep spreading your niceness and it will always come back ten fold!</text>

In the last 4 years alone the price for my unit has gone up $40 and at the time I opened this account they only had one unit size available/open so I had to go down a few doors to American Self Storage within a few weeks which is also a great storage unit and in the same time frame my unit price has only gone up $11 from initial price in the last 4 years,  just need to call Ms. Cox and see if they have any larger units available so I can combine and switch storage unit companies.< /review>

Ambience : Restaurant is not so big but you can find outdoor and indoor seating.. You can have some great vibes that's is suitable for any kind of celebrations or date night.

Food : all course here is absolutely delicious and you can find lots of options on the menu.

Service : Staff here are very nice and helpful. As I am regular customers here, I know every staff member here and they always provide good service .

Overall my experience here is amazing and I would recommended this place to all my friends and family...</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I went there to have dinner with my husband. Bad choice!! He ordered the chicken fajitas and I had the fish tacos. The chicken had no seasoning and the fish tacos did have a horrible taste of reused cooking oil! The food is horrible and it is over priced! I do not recommend it!</text>

<rating>4</rating><Text>these were the best tacos I've ever had at any restaurant but it seemed like the lady who was in charge in the kitchen when she made them they were the best. I came back the next day and order tacos again and she was not in the kitchen and the tacos weren't as good. The cucumber slices was a nice touch. She made the tortilla shell crispy which totally made it better than just warming it up. Nachos was pretty good.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Ring Ding little local spot that starts you off with chips and beans. I had the chicken tacos which were quite good with the added bonus of the Taco Tuesday discount for $1.25 each. The shrimp tacos were huge, excellent presentation great flavor and handmade tortillas at $4 each, but unfortunately the breading was not quite cooked through leaving me no choice but to remove it.< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Sorry but I did not like it because the lemons seem like old but they give a very bad taste to the food. I bought the Tower and my husband a cocktail.

(Translated by Google) Fresh seafood, but they should check when they pay their bill, they charge you food that they don't serve you and the prices of the drinks are exaggerated.

<text>They say to email them to resolve the problem but will never respond to your email

This is the closest store to my house and it's been 5 months that they still cant take my sprint payments... yet they can add phones and accessories to my account but cant take a payment? Making me drive to another city to do my payment. Bad service.

4/12/21
Once again a huge let down. I needed my phone upgraded today after I get out of work at 6. I waited in line for 35 min. They "tried" to get into my sprint account and said they cant. Wasted another 25 min. Cant even make it to another location. Unprofessional. Staff is very uneducated on their job.</text><Date>1618894045388<//Date>< name>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Was looking to open up an account with tmobile today and explore some phones. I asked about the promotions they got and the guy had told me that the only promotions is when you port over a number. I asked if there was any promos for just a new number and account and he very rudely said "everything I just said is what we got". On top of everything we couldn't even go inside. So I left and went to the tmobile off of bear Valley rd and ended up getting a new iPhone 11 pro max which they had on promotion when you activate a new line. All in all, I would not recommend this place to anybody unless you want to wait outside with a rep that does not even know his own promotions.< /Text>< pics>

With today's times they were very courteous and informative.  The were as expedient as could be to get me in and out without the wait.  They took care of all the questions I had better than expected.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Amazing customer service! The environment was welcoming and the staff was very friendly. It felt like a friend was helping me out as there was that human connection that was made. The process was a breeze and the gentleman that assisted me was very lively and upbeat, which made the experience the best. He even played my favorite band in the store and made good conversation as he was setting my new phone up. I have to say that this experience was very unique and positive and I’d gladly return to this location. I got my first iPhone, the Iphone SE and I absolutely love it! It’s simple and easy to use. It’s not too big like most phones and the price was great for an iPhone. It works smoothly and perfectly. I am a very satisfied customer! :) Thank you !< /Review>< Pictures>

As a paying costumer I should not have to call two separate stores to find out what is in stock. Although the employees at this store are normally very polite they lack knowledge and do not seem as eager to help as other stores (Hesperia). For this reasons and more I prefer to deal with the heavy traffic in Hesperia, and deal with the drive going out of town instead of dealing with this place. Almost as If I am dealing with completely different companies......sort of frustrating!
Annnnnd ! They contionously fail to answer their damn phones!!!!!!< /text>< date>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Went to the store just to purchase a simple screen protector and a case for my phone on November 18th, the total amount led up to $86.18. On the day of the purchase they charged me twice saying it was not going through. When I completed the purchase after the second attempt, and came back to work I verified in my account how much the purchase totaled and saw that they had charged me twice!!
The funny thing is, they actually took the money, TWICE!!
I called back the same day and they said the money would be refunded after the second business day. It is now November 25th and still no refund. I called the store a second time and a spoke to a Sales associate named Daniel who made the situation even worse. Had the audacity to elevate his voice to my mom saying they cannot refund my money and could only give me store credit. So if anybody shops here, check your account because after this experience they left a bad stigma on themselves. NEVER SHOPPING AT A T-MOBILE AGAIN!!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

This place is ridiculous Everytime I go there their computers are down and it takes over an hour just to order a screen protector replacement. Today I went to add a line, spent 1 1/2 hours doing that. The phone did not work when I got home. Had to call customer service and spend an additional hour trying to figure out why the phone didn't work. It was never activated. Beyond ridiculous!!!</review>

I would like to express my gratitude to Ivy. We were having issues trying to transfer service from another carrier onto the T-Mobile network, but she was determined to resolve the issue. She went far above and beyond my expectations. Even though the store had been closed for nearly 2 hours before we got everything squared away, she worked diligently to get it working! She was extremely helpful and patient during the whole process and I feel that she should be given the appropriate recognition that an employee that goes the extra mile deserves. Way to go, Ivy! 5 Stars!< /review>

T-Mobile is lit asf no matter what anyone says, screw Verizon, screw At&t, T-Mobile always stays true with no gimmicks. I have a Unlimited Everything plan for 45$ but do they charge me extra because its a "Grandfather plan", hell Nah they let me keep it with no extra charges cause they the best.<//text>

Waste of time. First called to check, then drove to store and I get a different story. they also lie to. They did not want to sell me a phone.  Reasons why T-Mobile is not good for you. I guess they don't want to make money.<//Text>

The food was piping hot, and stayed fresh, tender, and crunchy(onion rings) the full 10 minutes that it took me to get home. The server was polite and quick. I am totally satisfied and will order take out from them again.< /review>

The  reason we visited this place. because  applebee's website has several of good family special deals... And since my daughter was inviting us ... We decide to stop by and order a family deal.
The waiter wasn't aware of the deals on website..she said if we can look for it to see what we where talking about... After 15 mins.. we show her the special deals.
She didn't know how to put it on the system. She try to suggest us if we can order something else instead of the one we wanted to get in the first place?... We said if this why we here for... I guess the manager heard the conversation and step in to see what was going on.. she explained to waiter to just look the picture on my daughter cell phone and write down all the menu plates and the amount it shows on.  The manager 👍. she did took care of the problem well professional customer service ... I will come back  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.

Waiter ⭐⭐⭐⭐ for not been familiar with the 🍎 applebee's website special deals.< /Text>

I had the worst experience eating here.  The service was the worst.  The food took at least an hour and thirty minutes to get to me.  I ordered Mac and cheese and it had no type of cheese and no type of flavor at all WHO MESSES UP A MAC AND CHEESE.  To add on to it my food was COLD.  I was “promised” a brownie and I didn’t even get that they were going to have me wait again.  I will not be eating here again.<//Text>

I called before arriving to make sure that we, a family of 6 will be able to sit together. Person that answered said yes. When we arrived, Haileu said that we could not seat together. Then we found  a table  on the other side of  of the tent, where we sat. We asked to please clean table.   She  showed a bit of an attitude when taking out order and  the whole service was just not friendly at all. Sucks.< /Review>

<Review>Fake chicken! We got oriental chicken salad and a southwest chicken bowl and Mozzarella  sticks . The mozzarella sticks were pretty decent but when we got our entrees both of our chicken breast tasted like reconstituted pressed chicken, very rubbery with a very strange texture, and the chicken bowl had some lime flavoring to it that tasted just nasty.<//Review>< user>

<Text>Slow on to-gp.... ugh.
Used app, 30 min. Later to pick up, curbs all full, had to go inside, waited 45 minutes to receive food from unapologetic server. Only food for 2 people,  not a difficult order. Restaurant was half full on a Friday late afternoon. Disappointing.<//Text>< Pictures>

4 stars is for the food and the vigilance of the manager to correct my almost raw steak. I just love the ambiance of the parking lot while sitting next to a busy road of smog spitting cars. Did I mention we liked the food?</Text>

Love the fact that they have outdoor dining, but more importantly, the food is good and the drinks too. Good happy hour specials and a good place to go hangout. Once they are able to have indoor dining it'll be cool to hang at the bar and watch sports. Check it out.< /Review>

<Review>They didn't fill the order correctly forgot the fries, french onion soup was horrible not even close and burgers were cold. I had a pic up time of 440 pm got there at 444 waited for about 5 mins before they came out then told me order was being finished waited couple more minutes than they came back to verify the name oh that's ready she said I'll go get it another couple of minutes got food and just before getting home got a call they forgot the fries nice of them but they're 12 miles away. So I won't do this idea again. I ordered the bourbon burger if it had sauce on you couldn't prove it to me. Overall bad experience it proves that they can't do take out very good oh I've been to Applebee's many times never had good service at this unit others pretty good service. Here if you don't buy drinks at the your at the back of the line for food and service I have noticed.<//Review>< Pics>

Because we came in for a celebration we were charged 20 percent gratuity we all had separate checks and was told because it was more than 6 of us we were charged the gratuity like they assumed we would not tip and FYI I would have tipped more and actually tipped more than the 20 percent because our waitress was awesome</Review>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>Got our order in timely fashion, however... My potatoes were only add bacon / cheese, and there was sour cream slathered on top. My girlfriend's meal was supposed to be without lettuce, though it had plenty as you see in the photo. I was supposed to get tartar sauce for the shrimp, that didn't happen either. The cheesy broccoli, wasn't cheesy at all, maybe a pinch of shredded cheese on 2 of them. However, the zombie drink, and the red Dracula drink were both very good! The steak I ordered was cooked perfectly (for once), and the shrimp were also very good, though lacking tartar that was ordered. If it wasn't for the drinks and perfect steak / shrimp, this would be a 1 star review. (Yes I should of checked my order, but all this covid BS they were getting people in and out and I was trying not to hold up the line, next time I will make everyone else wait, lesson learned)</Text>< Resp>

Every time I go I blow away my daily calories. I had quesadilla burger which is excellent the next day. I wasn't blown away by the mixed pina Colada Christmas drink, it was very little berry and a lot coconut. They were very clean and well spaced.< /text>

The service was despicable. A group of ten were told our table was ready three times before we were seated. Then, eight were served and my girlfriend and I were told that she (the waitress) was going to serve another table and then return to take our order. The other couple, two military veterans, asked for a menu, and was told that she forgot and did not think that the couple was still interested. They did receive their order.  We were there for about two hours.</review>

Worst long island ice tea ever. Instead of 4 all clear liquors you get one called long island. You pay for 4 but get one. Deceitful theft. Long island is a long island. Shady thieves. Couldn't tip the bartender after this.< /Text>

Friendly staff and good food. Particularly the 2 for $22 is a good dinner option. I like the cocktails, but the drinks are all a bit pricey in comparison to the cost of the meal. The bathrooms could sometimes use a bit more attention.< /Text>

I go to this marvelous  restaurant from time to time because I like the special air that is unique to this place. The staff is very loving and professional. The service is remarkablywonderfully fast. Most important, the food you eat is outstanding. I ate there many times and I was always happy. The cost is reasobable. I suggest this restaurant to to everybody.<//text>

As far as the car side to go is concerned, it's better to just go in and get it. Their "I'm here button" doesn't work, and calling they dont answer.

<Text>Amazing customer service, good food, overall enjoyable experience! Our waiter was Joel and he did such an amazing job! My family and I have had a bad experience at another Applebees location, we swore off eating there. Tonight's experience gave us a change of heart and we will be back for a visit again! Great job to our waiter Joel for great service and overall experience!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I was there to pick up a to go order and no one even helped me for at least 10 minutes. They were in the kitchen eating. Which, hey I get it, we all gotta eat. But not when you're on the clock and you have people waiting. Then once I was helped it took 25 extra minutes. It was extremely busy so I understand but if I was greeted and helped right away I wouldn't have been so salty about the whole experience.</Text>< Pics>

It's always hit and miss when we go to Applebees. Last night was a serious miss. Our waiter Brandon provided us with some awful service. When we sat down, first off got our drink orders wrong. After we sat down some "regulars" sat down behind us about 15 minutes later and that's when Brandon went into action. He almost completely forgot about us. Not only did the table behind us get their appetizers before us, they also got their meals before us. They were a party of 4 and we were just a party of 2. So how does that happen? The food is the only thing not making this review a one star. The food came out great. You should treat every customer the same.<//Text>

Food was good (went for the all you can eat ribblets, Double crunch shrimp, and wings) the wings were as good as always, the ribblets seemed to be lacking and had a ton of small bones, the double crunch shrimp were actually really good when they were freshly fried, but when it came to the drinks they were quite pricey (even during happy hour) and when it comes to getting a bang for your buck I personally recommend Chili's over Applebee's. They have good quality deals and rewards on top of that.<//Text>

Applebee's isn't even trendy anymore there isn't one nice thing I could say and that includes the menu the service the bar just was a total disappointment and a reminder why I don't like to go to cookie cutter put on more Flair restaurants. I was very disappointed in the quality throughout the whole experience</Text>

Here now as we speak to make a long story short had some Discrepancies with the hostess, she had a rude unprofessional attitude, Trish the manager took exceptional care of the situation and us!! She is wonderful with her profession of work to the extent I'm here writing this review, she directed us to Joel the waiter with a great personality thank you trish for making this Halloween family dinner just perfect!!< /text>

It’s an Applebee’s. It’s not going to blow your mind, but the food is predictably good and the wait staff are friendly. If chain restaurants are your preference, this isn’t a bad one to stop at.< /Text>

Went right when it opened at 11am. Service was friendly and fast. Only issue was they don't chop the lettuce enough and you endes up with giant, whole leaves of lettuce. Other than that great as always.<//Text>

Edited:  Second visit was pretty good.  Still loving those onion rings.  Got the correct sauces... love the buffalo sauce for the chicken tenders...  We did have to wait 8 minutes when we were picking up inside but every server that passed by made sure we had been attended to.

Original Review:  Ordered online to pickup in the restaurant.  Ordering was easy, was even a promo at the time for online purchases above $25.  Food was ready quick and service was friendly.  Unfortunately the main downfall (among other things), we found out after getting home 20 minutes later that they completely messed up on the critical sauces to accompany both our meals!...  ... ... ...   It was too far to go back to take care of it so the manager promised to make it up to us the next time we're there.<//Review>

We ordered the dinner 2 for $22 I ordered the sirloin steak it was very good nice and juicy and the salad that came before the meal was surprisingly large.

<Text>I purposefully never come here, but what can I do when a get together is thrown, and this is chosen as the destination.
I just want to say fries shouldn't be cold and chewy like a leather shoelace, and chicken tenders probably should be hot aswell.
Yes they messed up chicken tenders and fries.
The beer was good but lacked the garnish, no big deal, but is again another sign of lazyness. Was a weeknight party of 8 and the restaurant wasn't packed. I know there are factors that I don't know or may not even understand, but my bottom line is I keep getting bad food here.
I don't hate you, I'm just not going to eat here.
Thanks, but no thanks.< /Text>< pictures>

Took my 11 year old here for his birthday - the whole family of 6. We had a good time; pleasant atmosphere. Our server (I'm sorry I forgot her name) was very helpful and kept her attention on us without being overbearing. What would make 5 stars is if they give you your second alcohol beverage on the house 😉 perhaps after a certain hour. I'm just saying, their limited time peach margarita was on point, but at $9 with a family of 6, including a 12 year old who eats like a grown man - that extra $9 would have killed me... although I would have went for it if hubby said yes. No luck. Anyway, after my husband gets over the bill, we will return.< /review>

<Text>The food is very tasty and matches it's description on the menu. Some places don't do a great job at ensuring accuracy but this place gets it right every time. The servers are overall friendly but sometimes they do tend to get frustrated if you do need what they offer. For example, they ask you if they can get you any boxes or more drinks and when you say yes, they seem upset. Regardless, I'd still recommend this location< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcabace7a0b6ef:0xb34484ddd0563f44< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've posted about the dining experience at my local Applebee's restaurant before & have always had a good experience when dining there! The service is great, the food is delicious & the restaurant staff are all friendly & courteous to everyone! What more can I say! I'd give a 10 star rating, but it only has 5 stars!</review>

<review>Saturday service was horrible. We jad a party of eight and one of us didn't get their food until we were about to leave after letting the server know numerous times. Also had to remind them about our drink orders not coming out. Never offered a refill on soda or water. This was our first bad experience unfortunately we had out of state guess so their experience was horrible</review>< pictures>

Okay so I love the food here. I come here every once in awhile with my friends or family. Everyone is very nice. My only problem is they always get at least one of the orders wrong, usually two orders wrong. It's not just this Applebee's, it's every one of them I've ever gone to. Don't know what the problem is. But food is good.<//Text>

<Review>Parking isn't too bad for an Applebees. Wich means yeah its cramped but not as bad as it could be. For just an extra few steps you can actually find it pretty easy. The bathroom is great, if you like to show off your privates that is. The sitting stall stare directly at the business end of the urinal. Lovely. But the service was quick, and nice food was what youd expect.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Exquisite would be an understatement. Sublime, would barely scratch the surface. Nothing can compare to the delicious glory that was the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey chicken tenders. And the artichoke and spinach dip? It was as if they plucked that from the garden of athena herself.

If i could live here, life would truly be good in the neighborhood.

<Text>Magnifico!! That 3 course meal was excellent, or my choice of selection I must say. To begin a house salad with blue cheese dressing, mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and as my main course a 3 cheese penne. 😘 It was scrumpcilicious. So much so I had a need to make a new word to help me describe it! 😅😁 Thanks Daryl for the excellent customer service! 👍</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Not the best experience I've had, really understaffed, was there for 2 hours had 2 beers my wife had 2 drinks, because our waiter was covering half the restaurant. Our entrees came out 1hour and 23 minutes after we ordered. Only thing they had going that was a plus was the $1 Mai tais.</review>< Pictures>

We ordered the French onion soup which was delicious. We also had chicken parmesan, the chicken was overcooked as was the pasta. We also ordered the chicken stir fry which was good. We had a little issue with the service, it took our server long periods to check on us and refill our drinks.
Update: Its been about 6 months since our last visit so we tried this Applebees again because I had a gift card and unfortunately had about the same results. Less than attentive service and the pasta was swimming in a lake of flavorless red tinted water.< /Review>

I always come here but my last experience was not to satisfactory. My steak was undercooked and was taken to get fixed and came back charred, and was very tough. Took 30 minutes to get drinks, table next to us was also complaining and place wasn't even busy.</Review>

<review>We had a large crowd and the one server did good keeping up. The food was delivered in stages for the comfort of the cook. That seamed ok until it happened. Then it sucked. The food and literally everything else was great though.< /review>< Time>

It was weird. I got a gift card for here because I graduated. The martdi  was very helpful in seating us. After were seated there was a waiter that we overhear refusing to help us. (maby because my husband shaves his head because he has a bald spot and has a goatee)  several of the other staff harassed the waiter for refusing to serve us. He then came out to take our order was was very rude and condescending  kept calling my husband a rock star and just being very condescending we were going to leave but ended up moving to another waitress section and she was great it was weird I just didn't expect it.  I guess its this White privilege just not used to being discriminated against.I dont know.<//text>

Happy hr is the best time to go.... all applebees are set up the same way... the center part is the bar area... the rest is what I'd call the common area... where " families ... with young children should sit".... the bar is MY McDonald's playground.... and I have no filter.... I drink alcohol, my mouth is worse than a sailor's.... if you want to bring your kid and sit close to where I'm sitting.... shame on you... you wouldn't want me to sit at the McDonald's playground and use foul language while your children are playing...< /text>

The service was terrible. waited a long time for order and when it got there it was wrong. They did compensate us for the order. I have been there before and the service was great. I guess there is a big difference between the daytime workers and the night workers.<//Review>

Horrible .. the female waitress with the nose ring is the only nice person that works there. When I asked about the order the waiter said that's not my dept. I seen The order was sitting there. Horrible horrible horrible.  I seen the Manager handling food, and handling cash without gloves or washing his hand.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>We were pleasantly surprised by both the food and service at this location. The prices were very reasonable and it seems like they've stepped up their game in regards to food so this is definitely worth a visit for lunch with a group of workmates or a quick and easy dinner out.< /text>< pics>

Kimber is an amazing bartender!! She's very personable and makes you feel very welcome. And for someone who is from out of the area but loves Applebees it's great to have a new location and favorite bartender. Everyone should come for a night out and keep her company!!< /text>

<text>I love Apple bees but my experience this one time was kind of disappointing. My waiter was not as attentive as I would have liked him to be. I think his name was Demetrius. I had a coupon and I tried giving it to him and he said wait until the end. Well, I ended up forgetting at the end because I am enjoying family time and have a lot of kids. If I was trying to give you something in the beginning of service, then it is your responsibility to help the customer remember. Also, I had ordered onion rings with my burger. Again, he "forgot" to put that down, and I was so busy tending to my 6 kids that I forgot I ordered onion rings and just ended up eating the fries that was brought out by someone else. He was unapologetic. He didn't bring my food out either, it was 2 other waiters that brought it out and I saw him chillen talking to someone. When we left he didn't even say bye or thank you for coming. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!
i gave 3 stars solely, on the fact that Appe bee's is my favorite restaurant.<//text>< pictures>

<review>ORDERED TO GO AFTER DOOR DASH RIPPED US OFF AND i get it was a busy Friday night HOWEVER my FOOD ORDER was ALMOST $100.!! THAT being said it took 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge i was EVEN THERE!! I WATCHED the "to-go"  GUY take an order for 15 minutes WHOLE my ribs AND steaks were getting cold.Manager offered ICE tea for being ignored AND food being ice cold. DID say they "reheated" steaks. Whatever THAT meant. Needless to say i DON'T think we will be ordering ANYTHING from there anytime soon. Sorry Applebees<//review>< GmapID>

They ruined all of the food by putting too too much pepper on everything. They even put pepper on the french fries. Vomit. And they don't have Coke, only Pepsi so if you want to wash down the pepper you have to drink water.<//Review>

The Manager tried hard to fix our dinner and our server was very apologetic. Stars for that.
We were seated and forgotten, the manager took our drink order when he noticed, the waters came with lemon after requesting no lemon. There were hardly any chips with the spinach dip. We asked for a side of pico with it and they didn't bring the other salsa so we had to ask for that. The burgers were ordered no pink and they were barely cooked. The sides were not the ones ordered with the grilled chicken... The server and manager were horrified at our food... At least they were nice.< /Text>

<Text>They ruined all of the food by putting too too much pepper on everything. They even put pepper on the french fries. Vomit. And they don't have Coke, only Pepsi so if you want to wash down the pepper you have to drink water.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The Manager tried hard to fix our dinner and our server was very apologetic. Stars for that.
We were seated and forgotten, the manager took our drink order when he noticed, the waters came with lemon after requesting no lemon. There were hardly any chips with the spinach dip. We asked for a side of pico with it and they didn't bring the other salsa so we had to ask for that. The burgers were ordered no pink and they were barely cooked. The sides were not the ones ordered with the grilled chicken... The server and manager were horrified at our food... At least they were nice.</Text>

<Text>Applebees is my favorite restaurant, I went to Applebee's 3 weeks ago and
the server that helped me was  really nice. For me she did her job the right way,  and I saw all other servers helping nice and the right way too while I was there. And Applebee's is my favorite restaurant because they do your order exactly how you want it and the server takes it fast to you.  You don't have to wait long time for your order at Applebee's. So I will go to Applebee's again.< /Text>< pics>

I understand weekends could be busy but this Applebee's only had one server at 6:00 and had terrible management. The hostess did not keep us informed while we waited and we could see multiple large tables for our party. Never going to this location again< /review>

<Text>On today's visit there were 4 adults there to have a couple drinks and dinner. We had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks and than when our dinner was brought out they only brought out 2 dinners and the other 2 dinners came about 15 minutes later. By than the first 2 dinners were cold as we waited for the other 2 dinners. We spoke to the manager and she knocked off 50% of the total bill. That was okay but things like this shouldn't happen.</Text><name>Henry Gonzales< /name><gmap_id>0x80dcabace7a0b6ef:0xb34484ddd0563f44<//gmap_id><UserId.>101961844877218850405< /UserId.>< Resp>

Very slow service. Wasnt even busy and still ended up waiting 40minutes for our food. Shrimp was burnt. Steak and ribs were dry and slightly cold.  Manager was rude about compensating our check. Giving me a sobe story about it coming out of the company back account as if I care.<//review>

Where do I begin, is it the badly over prepared chicken tenders my son had, which nearly chipped his tooth (exaggerating, but nevertheless that's how over cooked they were) or is it the microwaved french fries that were deep fried to hide their freezer burned taste. It quite possibly could have been the wanna be latin hipster model bartender who thinks he's a tough guy for talking down at a customer who simple was asking for a drink the server had yet to bring after 20mins of waiting (not over exaggerating that part, bartender nor wait).

I find it very disappointing that this Applebee's was very unprepared as a staff and operating business. The kitchen made several mistakes throughout our order and just sitting at our booth observing the room, it seemed to be, we weren't the only group who had a lack luster experience.

Fortunately, the manager and our server had some decency about them and attempted to correct the issue. However, that time came and went with Mr tough guy at the bar. They did decide to comp the chicken fingers and drink, which was considerate of them. But, by far, the reputation and experience had already been damaged.

If you happen to find yourself at this location, tred carefully at the bar, confrontational wannabe model may try to spike your drink or may just have you waiting aimlessly. If you dare choose to sit, beware of the teeth chipping chicken fingers and long delays with a lost staff who jist may need an overhual in efficiency... probably starting with the kitchen.

So... all in all, Applebee's never go back... not worth the unfulfilled hunger and hassle. Hopefully this helps someone before it's too late!<//Review>< resp>

Worst service me and my daughter has ever had at any applebee's we never got service from our waitress only seen her twice once to see that we got our food which she didn't even take our order the manager did and once we got our food my daughter asked for some more napkins since she ordered ribs so she can clean her hands while eating and asked for a straw and we never got neither either from our waitress or from the manager which is the one that had asked us if we're needed anything else< /text>

<Date>1522272708105< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>If there was a way to give negative stars, I'd completely rate this establishment with a negative 5 star rating. Where do I begin, is it the badly over prepared chicken tenders my son had, which nearly chipped his tooth (exaggerating, but nevertheless that's how over cooked they were) or is it the microwaved french fries that were deep fried to hide their freezer burned taste. It quite possibly could have been the wanna be latin hipster model bartender who thinks he's a tough guy for talking down at a customer who simple was asking for a drink the server had yet to bring after 20mins of waiting (not over exaggerating that part, bartender nor wait).

I find it very disappointing that this Applebee's was very unprepared as a staff and operating business. The kitchen made several mistakes throughout our order and just sitting at our booth observing the room, it seemed to be, we weren't the only group who had a lack luster experience.

Fortunately, the manager and our server had some decency about them and attempted to correct the issue. However, that time came and went with Mr tough guy at the bar. They did decide to comp the chicken fingers and drink, which was considerate of them. But, by far, the reputation and experience had already been damaged.

If you happen to find yourself at this location, tred carefully at the bar, confrontational wannabe model may try to spike your drink or may just have you waiting aimlessly. If you dare choose to sit, beware of the teeth chipping chicken fingers and long delays with a lost staff who jist may need an overhual in efficiency... probably starting with the kitchen.

So... all in all, Applebee's never go back... not worth the unfulfilled hunger and hassle. Hopefully this helps someone before it's too late!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1522503729487, 'text': "Lifestyle Collective Thanks for reaching out. We take feedback seriously.

< Review>
The wrong main dinner was brought to me.This happened to me a month ago.Although the stir fry was comped I was embarrased.Food is rarely warm.Servers are friendly.Wish a small salad could be part of a main dinner or a side..we have gone there once every 3 weeks for 3 years.</Review>

Applebee's tops our list for late night grub. The menu is the usual corporate faire, but at least it's consistent. More of a burger and beer place, but there's enough variety to please most.</text>

Food is fine, but you often can't get through lunch within an hour.  If you're in a hurry, this might not be your best choice.</Review>

< Review>
Got a waitress with Huge digusting tatoo across her chest, and a gay as hell manager sitting in next booth listening to too loud a music and singimg out loud. Order got screwed up by tattoo lady 3 times, food was pretty blah, good cheese sticks though, and they had no to go cups for a expensive left over drink. Not typical of most Applebees.< /Review>

It's Applebee's, what do you expect. Food was decent, but a little pricey for what you get.< /Text>

Under staffed for a packed location. It took 38mins before our order was taken. The food was warm but I've found that to be the same at other locations as well. I've never gotten my food HOT.  I've tried 5 locations I think I'm done with this chain.<//review>

This review is long overdue, sorry about that!
On August 17th, 2014, my Honey and I set out for an early dinner. My appetite was leaning towards Applebee’s.

I had informed my husband that they had added some healthy choices to their menu since the last time we made a visit. Early this year we were unable to stay and dine because there were no choices of interest for him. So I was pretty sure that this time he would find something.

The host greeted us in a timely fashion. I asked the greeter if my husband could please view one of the menus before seating us, and that was no problem.
He did find a few things to his amazement.

We were escorted to a nice area of the restaurant, and quickly greeted by our wait.
A very cheerful young man approached our table and introduced himself as Robert. I have to say that his eagerness made me feel good and put a big smile on my face! I love it when waits are so cheery-eerie. We had a few questions regarding one of the entrees, so Robert took the initiative to go and ask one of his managers to come over and speak with us.

Within a minute we were greeted by Brittany, who had a bubbly outgoing personality. She explained that however, we wanted to substitute rice for more vegetables or another selection that they do their best to accommodate their customers. Their aim is to make sure that customers have a good experience and return.

My husband made a special request for more veggies in place of rice with his entree. Robert placed our order, and shortly after he walked away another manager approached our table and announced that the order would be coming right up; “In fact sir, I will prepare it for you to make sure that it is just the way you like it!

Long story short, when Robert returned with the food everything was perfect. The veggies were crisp just as he likes them and the portion was huge. The grilled chicken was melt in your mouth and seasoned to perfection! I had the Bourbon steak and it was equally prepared to my liking.

I must say, the food was delicious and we were treated like royalty!
The staff is fantastic at this location. The two managers, Armando and Brittany go far beyond their call of duty to give the best in customer service. Our wait, Robert, was extremely accommodating, delightful and polite.

Thank you all for such an awesome experience. Corporate is most fortunate to have you as employees!  Keep up the great work!

Just got out of this Applebees, the host Allan was nice, professional, and was taking items off our table.
Our waitress Aldema I believe that's how you spell it, she was on point, bubbly, and professional as well.
Our orders came out awesome and tasty. I got me a Red Apple Sangeria which was PRRFECT and ROCKIN GREAT, not over poured not under poured. I was seeing the manager be hands on which is nice, she is the one that gave us our food, she was kind and professional...
GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE and FOOD.
I will be returning to this location better than the Highland one.

The only thing I can say bad is that my son's fries was to salty, which it wasn't a big deal to me.</Text>

Within a minute we were greeted by Brittany, who had a bubbly outgoing personality. She explained that however, we wanted to substitute rice for more vegetables or another selection that they do their best to accommodate their customers. Their aim is to make sure that customers have a good experience and return.

My husband made a special request for more veggies in place of rice with his entree. Robert placed our order, and shortly after he walked away another manager approached our table and announced that the order would be coming right up; “In fact sir, I will prepare it for you to make sure that it is just the way you like it!

Long story short, when Robert returned with the food everything was perfect. The veggies were crisp just as he likes them and the portion was huge. The grilled chicken was melt in your mouth and seasoned to perfection! I had the Bourbon steak and it was equally prepared to my liking.

I must say, the food was delicious and we were treated like royalty!
The staff is fantastic at this location. The two managers, Armando and Brittany go far beyond their call of duty to give the best in customer service. Our wait, Robert, was extremely accommodating, delightful and polite.

Thank you all for such an awesome experience. Corporate is most fortunate to have you as employees!  Keep up the great work!

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>We got to Applebee's at 6pm, got a table right away, had to wait for service, kinda slow. Had to ask for menu's, then had to ask for silver ware. Ordered, took awhile to arrive, meal was cold ( ribs ). Our service was a 5 out of 10.
