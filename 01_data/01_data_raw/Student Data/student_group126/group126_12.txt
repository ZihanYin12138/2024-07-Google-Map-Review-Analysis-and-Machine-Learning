Fastest smog check ever! No need for appointment. Even with 3 customers in front of you, you are in and out fast. Highly recommend. I've been coming for years. Prices are also great.</review>

<text>I have a habit of returning to places that I'm happy with and I am very happy with this place. I will need to get my vehicle smogged every so often and when I do, I come here. The guy that works here is always hustling to get the customers in and out as fast as he can. Hard working and professional, I appreciate him and I'm confident you will too!<//text><Time>1599718349665< /Time><UserId.>112416378775254612403<//UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2d7d5c047031f:0x78480a0d5411416d< /Gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating>< name>

<Review>I have a 2004 Ford that my wife never drives, but it is in great shape and I love it, but I took it to smog and it failed. The owner, asked how we use it, and when I told him, he helped me get it to pass LEGALLY! Really. His name is Greg. Not every car will pass.depends on age and circumstances.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>5< /rate><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2d7d5c047031f:0x78480a0d5411416d< /gmapID><Date>1604941461084< /Date>< name>

<review>The guy running this place is incredibly friendly. Had some good conversation while the test was going on and he's been working on cars in some capacity since he was a teen. Had some feedback on a car I just bought and even tighten down the battery terminal connections when he found they were loose. The shop isn't in my area but I'll drive out here again to visit this guy.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I needed a smog done last min. Didn't realize my car needed it before I could get my registration. Called around and found Vista smog. Thought it was part of the car wash next door but its separate. No appointments taken but there wasn't much of a wait. There was a car right before us and when it was our turn it was so quick and easy. The man did it all him self and submitted all paper work needed to DMV through there system. Great friendly fast service. Great reasonable price. Definitely will be returning here for all my future smog needs. Thank you< /Text><Name>Great White< /Name>< user_id>

<text>A+ the guy there is cool and friendly. Took my truck there 3 times in one day cuz my oxygen sensor wasn't reading for a smog. The guy was very cool every time he check it and on the 3rd try it passed. He was as happy as I was that it passed. Very fast service. Definitely going back to smog my other cars.....

Anyone in need of a Smog? I highly recommend this place! As a girl I always fear being swindled into paying more or for extra stuff that  I really don't need... Greg was extremely professional and generous and charged me a lot less than other places I had called. So glad I came here, thank you so much Greg for an awesome first time Smog check experience 😊</Text>

This place is conveniently located right off the 10 freeway,  and exit Vincent Avenue, right next to the car wash.   The owner: Greg,  is a very friendly guy with a warm and helping attitude.   You can sit comfortably inside of the shop and wait for about 10 minutes to have him performing the smog check with no stress!

I was very happy with my service, Greg helped me out and in 20 mins I was out of there. He congratulated me that my car passed smog and I walked out of there with a great feeling. Thank you Greg I will surely recommend you to my friends and family !< /Review>

Even though I'm frustrated that my car isn't passing smog, this guy was very nice and calming. He even let me have a freebie!!! He does have a thick accent and he is very assertive, but that's because he gets it done fast!<//Text>

<text>The  guy barely spoke English. I took an old car to him and he refused to test it because he thought it would "break the machine." He didn't even test my car and I had to take it somewhere else. If he doesn't want to test old cars, he should have a sign up somewhere saying that he doesn't know what he's doing. I will NEVER take any more cars to him NOR do I recommend him, especially if you have an older car.</text>< gmapID>

<text>Dr Chang and his crew are THE BEST! So caring, accommodating, gentle and nice. Dr Chang is honestly a Miracle Worker. I came in with an emergency situation and very depressed about it. He took the time to talk to me and I knew I was in good hands. I have hope and I’m grateful that I will have my smile back. Waterford Dental and Dr Chang ROCK 😀< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

<review>Staff works well together to help you.  My daughter and I both have dental and orthodontic work done at Waterford.  We originally looked here because of the proximity to home, but even now that we're across town, we still enjoy the office.  The front office works well to find appointments that work with our schedule, and we have both had great results with our orthodontic work.  The front and back office seems to get along well, which is nice.  I've been to other offices where that is not the case, and it feels very awkward to visit.  The staff at Waterford is always friendly and professional, and they seem to have updated technology when it comes to their record keeping and tools.  That gives me more confidence about the work than some outdated offices I've been to in the past.
Waterford also has a points system that offers rewards.  You get points for elected services and even for showing up on time to your appointments.  When you accumulate points, you can get rewarded with perks and gift cards.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAE5tbEW1_CWuO6NOOlYIRiokNZDr0jaQWil_b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbHKHOjTWgbfasHbjCwhFEEVexkv231KGqj4pD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-bGDpSl_c14rvTZ4bOOTA_28lTkTY5EucalOk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<review>I am new to the area and chose Waterford Dental Group based on their hundreds of positive reviews. I am so glad that I did. Everyone is extremely friendly and made me feel comfortable from the time I walked through the door and continued throughout my entire appointment. I will definitely be using Waterford Dental in the future and will be scheduling my family here as well!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>Great dental assistant (Denay) - friendly, knowledgeable and does a very good job.
X-Ray technician works quickly and efficiently.
Dr. Perkins is sharp and has an answer for all my questions ( and will back-up what he says much of the time with pictures).  Together he and his assistant work quickly with no wasted time. Five stars!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I ❤️ Waterford!
I’ve been coming here since moving to Dublin 10 years ago. The office is a well run machine! Appointments are on time, staff is very professional, the office is clean and everyone is so nice. Since Covid, the extra care they take in making sure everything is clean and safe is much appreciated. They have air purifiers in every dental suite and sanitize everything down to the pens and lead aprons.  Dr Perkins is my primary provider and he’s both smart and personable. Denay is my RDH and we chat like she’s an old friend. I have converted my husband and two friends to this practice and they are so happy!< /Review>

New to Waterford Dental. First, they are very attentive to following Covid 19 guidelines. Important and noticed. I was kindly greeted and promptly evaluated. I've only had a single appointment at this point. It was with Dr. Lee. A warm and friendly man who was genuinely concerned with my comfort throughout the procedure. I am now one day post procedure and am feeling better than I did before I went in. Of course that is the goal, but in past experiences with other groups, not always the outcome. So far everything has been done with care and professionalism. Appreciated.< /review>

I drive far to see this group of Amazing people, we need our teeth and it’s important to feel safe and taken care of, Their office is clean and modern.
Dr. Chang took my pain seriously after 1.5 years of telling my dentist of 23 years it’s hurts right here.... they have state of the art High technology equipment... a huge plus in the diagnosis and treatment plans and to help us maintain our daily dental hygiene routines.
Dr. Ma. Did a root canal and I was prepared for a day or two of pain... to my satisfaction NO PAIN!
The entire staff is WONDERFUL and KIND.  Thank you Jackie & Janelle for the referral to this dental group!</text>

<Text>Finding a Dentist like Dr Rodger Chang was life changing for me.   I had been Petrified of the Dentist since I was a young girl.  Dr Chang has been able to help me with the fear, treat me with me feeling no pain and recently fit me in for an emergency visit.
I can’t Thank him enough or his wonderful staff at Waterford Dental.< /Text><userid>107803531376992032083</userid>< user_name>

Waterford is a clean, family friendly practice. Having Ramen as my hygienist was/is a privilege. The front desk staff are safe and efficient, which means a lot during these times. The dentists take time to further discuss concerns and show that they care about helping their patients.</Text>

<Review>This is by far the best dental practice that I've ever been to. Everyone that I've encountered during my numerous visits in 2018 for implants, cleanings and crowns jas constantly been on their A game from the moment you arrive until the time you leave. Welcoming front office staff, knowledgeable dentists, and efficient, compassionate billing staff. Who strands out to me right now in this all star lineup is Aquila and Joanna.</Review>< time>

Was having some pain. They got me in immediately, despite my not having established service. Staff was friendly and professional. The dentist was intelligent and an excellent communicator. And a nice guy to boot.</review>

Awesome Staff, environment, and service. The kids felt super special and less anxious, all thanks to the friendly staff and their care. I was given honest advice and would definitely go back. Would love to recommend it to other families and friends. Great place for kids for oral hygiene.</Text>

In all my years as a patient at Waterford, the staff has been excellent. I’ve been pleased with the service and care of the office.
I am, however concerned about the unethical and possibly illegal practice of obtaining and then holding patients’ over-payments, usually without their knowledge or consent.</review>

< review>
I spoke to a receptionist and canceled my appointment 2 weeks prior to appointment and still Someone called to tell me I missed my appointment. When I told them I already canceled my appointment 2 weeks ago they were .. “ who did you talk to “ its not my job to remember names of office staff ... 1. Office staff should do their jobs 2. If a patient is telling then that’s the truth why should I go around asking names to prove I spoke to someone</review>

Amazing, never a bad experience, been going here since I was a child. Excellent service, great staff. I don't eat meat anymore as well, and they always have options for me.<//Text>

Its pretty solid the smoothies are good its not too expensive if you get the large chicken and rice and want extra sauce then you should get it on the side mine was damn near soup but its pretty solid like panda express level eats plus smoothies so id probably rather it
(Honey walnut shrimp is overrated btw)</Text>

Wish I could say I loved it but the vegetable and shrimp tempura had way too much batter on them. Great prices though. Staff was very friendly! The dragon and shrimp sushi rolls tasted very fresh. There were no jalapeños on the sushi like another commenter posted. If you want spicier food, just ask the staff and they will try to accommodate you.</text>

<Name>Yuki Kimura (Yukiki)< /Name><time>1535826910383<//time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>Never has anything I ordered come out piping hot. It seems that most places let it sit for 2 minutes before someone takes it over, even with take-out. Here, however, the curry chicken katsu I ordered was so fresh that I was taken aback by the temperature. The katsu was perfectly crisp with soft meat inside, and the curry flavorful. It tasted like a homemade meal, especially with the ceramic plate. I've also had the udon and unagi bowl, both amazing. The shakes are also the best I've ever had.<//text>< pictures>

I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. That's the small portion... Let me say that again, pictured is the small portion, and it's $5. The large portion items are $7, and I saw one, it's easily twice the size. My girlfriend ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken, just as big and very yummy. We also got a Ebi Roll, and a Spicy Tuna Roll, all top shelf items with out question.  My only grip is no soda fountain, so we had to get Snapple. But all of that, 2 bowls, 2 rolls, and 2 drinks. $28. I can not tell you how good this food was for the price.

On our way out, we decided heck with it, lets get a smoothie. They are like $3.50 for a small, which is the perfect size. I had a banana and my gf had a mango. It tasted like they just crammed a ton of fruit in there. It was heavy like a milk shake, and tasted like heaven. Soo amazing, and I know I will be showing up again when the weather starts to get warm, like it already is. They do have a large version of the smoothies, and I think thy were like $4.50 or so, and the sign says 64oz, but I saw a few people order them, I think the sign lies, they were HUGE!!! Soo worth it.

In conclusion:
The scary part about this place is how good and cheap it is. It's also right next to the house, just as close as McD's, and basically the same price for a simple meal.< /text>< pictures>

Not true Japanese food. All the "seafood" is cooked and the variety is extremely limited. If you want REAL sushi, I recommend any OTHER place in town.</review>

<Text>It's a small restaurant, but comfortable.  The food is very good and low cost.  Decent varierty is available and their bento box combos are great. There is a bit of a wait at times since it's a small staff, but I would absolutely recommend the place.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1558327430509, 'text': 'Thanks for your kind words.'}< /Resp><pictures>None</pictures>< user_id>

Great chicken teryachi bowls.  They have good banana-strawberry smoothies.  The only reason they dodn"t get a 5 was they didn't mix the power additive very well. So the smoothy was laced with these small slimy fish egg looking things.  Kind of gross but they are usually great.<//Review>

Symes Cadillac provides a quality dealership, with a staff of very experienced and polite employees.  My personal comfort is as important to the staff as the quality of the work performed on my vehicle.  Service to the vehicle is done within the time proposed at check-in.  Symes Cadillac really cares to make their customers more than satisfied.< /text>

Great customer service. Quick in and out, seemless purchase of our new addition. A fully equipped 2019 Chevy Silverado. Priced to sell fast and we are so glad we got it. No complaints at all. Our sales person Will was exceptional!! Highly recommended them and would buy from them again.</text>

I am  CEO and Doctor of a great company.

After  Many years of buying Cadillac from this dealership I had an issue that needed to be resolved and  the customer service by the head guy turned out extremely  insensitive and quite rude.

I spent over 200,000 at this place in 5 years.

I've been blessed to build a pretty decent and highly rated treatment center.( Dedicato Treatment Center and now have a new book that will be a movie "FAITH TO FREEDOM FROM DUMPSTER TO DOCTOR).

I happen to be one of only a few African American Doctors with all my credentials and accredited by the Joint Commission (one of only 6 percent of all treatment centers in the entire country).

Unfortunately I took my business elsewhere.  I buy Cadillacs every few years. I guess sales mean nothing to them. Must be nice when you can treat a customer insensitive and still make money off the backs of their hard work...

I'm looking for a new 2021 Excalade and guess what?...this place is off my list.< /text>

<Text>We buy  several cars a year for business and personal. Victor did a great job in getting our Cadillac financed, and he even delivered it 2 hours away. Really impressed, everything with contract and vehicle was exactly what we agreed to. I was busy and he offered to deliver it, huge bonus points!<//Text>< pics>

Traded my 2019 grand sport for a 2021 xt4 today. Arman was great and fair. This was hard for me but I needed a life style change and everyone at symes made it easy.<//review>

Tried to up sell me a regular oil change at $179.  That made me upset.  Luckily, I question everything.  He also left me waiting , my car was done and he left to lunch.

Excellent leasing experience. Ask for Arman Boghozian he is an honest, straight forward, patient sales consultant with frank communication skills.  The entire staff stayed past closing time so I could finish my lease agreement and get my new car the same day. Everything was explained thoroughly and all my questions were kindly answered. Arman quickly answered my questions even after I took the car home.  My deal was the best I could get anywhere else.</Text>

Drove into Symes with a check engine light on with no appointment. Daniel Rodriguez helped me and was able to start diagnosing the problem right away. He was personable, kept me informed of the status, and was able to find me a loaner car which was really nice. They were able to fix the problem in a day. Appreciate Daniel's sense of urgency.</Text>

Service Department under David T. is blatantly overcharging for labor time needed to make repairs. At $195 per hour it adds up! David also approves technician's recommend repairs that are not needed. I was given an estimate for starter replacement with 4 hrs labor.  Manufacture recommended labor time is 2.5 hrs. Replacement of battery solved the problem and a replacement starter was not needed. Even more disturbing is that technician Iggy recommended brake fluid to be changed due to the fluid looking dirty.  Fluid and master cylinder had been replaced 7 months prior and visually inspected 1 month prior with no issues.  Once questioned about brake fluid integrity, David recommended to leave it alone.  Why would a service department take a chance with your braking system? I replaced the fluid even though it didn't need replacement since I no longer trust the Symes Cadillac Service Department.  It is quite clear to me this company is concerned about their profit more than your safety.< /Text>

John and Danny really turned things around and made my holiday! John quickly got the parts ordered and called to inform me when they arrived early!

Danny was incredible. My timing was really tight and he was able to accommodate my urgent request to get the install completed and get me on the road. He stayed past his lunch to make sure that the bars got installed in the position I desired. He had to take his break before it was done,  and made sure the rest of the office staff knew exactly what was happening.

Somehow he even managed to get it washed and get me out the door faster than I had planned.

Danny and John really turned around a stressful situation and showed me what first class customer service is all about.

I highly recommend these guys if your in the area!!!< /text><Name>Jon K< /Name></record>

Service review:  Dave (service mgr.) and Diana (service advisor) are the best in the business.  Service is always friendly and most importantly they put their Clients 1st and they both are always up front with pricing and time spent...I would recommend Symes Cadillac to everyone, especially their EXCELLENT service.  Thank you, Bill K.< /Review>

< Review>
Buying a car is a very stressful and time consuming event.  Shanye Daniels made it very easy and pleasant.  No haggling on the price or payment.  Also had a couple of cosmetic concerns but Will took care of it with no hesitation.  I highly recommend this dealership!  Thank you for a great experience.< /Review>

Eric Leibrich rating : I had the pleasure once again of dealing with Danny Rodriguez . Extremely efficient with a can-do attitude. He walked me through the process of getting my Corvette just what it needed. Very informative. You’re not just a number when Danny’s taking care of you. He’s what every employer seeks in an employee. I give him a Triple A rating !!!< /Review>

< review>
Our car seat heater & cooling system was not working well, when they checked it they said nothing was wrong. We tried back a month later and they finally said oh yes they are not working.They would have to order the part, it took months and never called us back, we had to call and check up on it a couple of times.We we’re told we would get tire rotations for our troubles, once at pick up That was also not done:(
So had to wait additionally so they can rotate the tires. The WORST part was getting home only to find out the the drivers seat was not assembled correctly and the back part to it fell OFF. There was also damage to my dash board as if the tools that they used to fix the seat were place on it , and created some type of burn to it . SO UPSETTING!!!!! Not happy at ALL</review>

I have had several issues with my SRX lately, but was fortunate to encounter service consultant, Danny Rodriguez. He was incredibly knowledgeable and provided excellent service. He definitely understands the meaning of customer service! He made an otherwise distressing experience one that was painless. I’m even thinking of buying another SRX soon. Thanks Danny!< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>When I was browsing here, one of the sales rep, Howard, entered my car without my permission, unlocked the door when I kept trying to lock it and did push-ups on my driver's seat. I know he was trying to help as we were discussing a technical issue but he was overly enthusiastic, and forced me to approach my car which was in unlocking range of my remote. It wasn't his fault, but some people are really sensitive and need to have their wished unconditionally respected, and want to be completely protected from unsolicited actions. I already stated that I have issues and do not wish to continue to a stage that would result in injury, but he didn't get the memo. Stay away from me.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I originally saw the vehicle I purchased on Autotrader.

It was only on there for one day and then disappeared, I was very disappointed as I thought the vehicle had sold.

I called the dealership to confirm and spoke with the salesman by the name of John Dajkovich.

He stated they still had the vehicle but was waiting on the title from the person who traded it in before they were able to sell it.

I told him I was Very interested in the vehicle and could they please contact me when it was available for sale.

Bear in mind the vehicle was in Pasadena and I lived in Phoenix, however he stated I was the first one that inquired about the vehicle so that I would be the first one called.

Most dealerships would’ve taken the easy way out and called someone locally who would inquired rather than someone 350 miles away who may or may not buy the vehicle.

But John held up his end of the bargain and I was the first one called on the vehicle.

I drove over the next day to look at the vehicle and decided to immediately purchase it.

This vehicle is a 2006 Cadillac DTS with only 37,000 original miles at a one owner car.

It looks absolutely new, and this is my dream car that I can now drive in my retirement.

John is probably one of the best salesman that I have ever run across in my entire years of buying cars.

I give this dealership the highest rating and would purchase another vehicle from them again, however I doubt that I will ever trade off this Cadillac.

Thanks to the entire staff of Symes Cadillac for making this a very easy and painless transaction!< /Review>

<Text>I took in my car today to fix two recalls and I was greeted by Marlene Bobrowsky with a good morning, a smile, and she asked if she could call my shuttle.  She took my keys checked me in under 10 minutes. When I was called to pick up my car just 3 hrs later (speedy) before I even walked in through the service door I saw Marlene pick up the phone while she smiled at me..once I entered she had my paperwork in hand-I was impressed and I asked if she remembered me and she said of course! My paperwork was ready and she told me my car was being pulled up in under 5 minutes.  I know traffic was light but the customer service -the best I have ever seen in over 20 plus years.  I used to own a European Car and their dealership as elegant as they made it the customer service was horrid.  I am so thankful to see customer service still exist in a world that it now void of it for the most part.  I will continue to come back and refer anyone that I meet.

< Review>
Really disappointed in their parts dept.  Ordered several parts for my car and input VIN  to ensure all matched.  Most are right, but the seat belts are incorrect version.  John Canales is refusing to accept my part return even though their website confirmed the seat belt ordered fits my vehicle when it does not.  Sent him a screen shot to show the site STILL showing this incorrect part fits my car and he has gone dark and won't respond.  Won't be ordering from them again.<//Review>

Everyone was professional, knowledgeable and helpful. Buying or leasing a car is one of my absolute least favorite tasks and Symes Cadillac makes it painless. Shanye Daniels will respond to your inquiries at all hours, by email, text, whatever, making it easy to do your homework on your own time. Thank you!<//text>

I just had the BEST car buying experience ever!  John Dajkovich is the most knowledgeable, patient, kind (not to mention, hilarious) salesperson I have ever dealt with! He made leasing my Cadillac XT5 so quick and painless, I will definitely be going back to him for my next one! Symes Cadillac is so lucky to have him! THANK YOU JOHN!!! You’re the BEST!!!< /review>

Just leased a Cadillac from John Dajkovich and had a terrific experience. He really worked with us and fought on our side to get the best deal. John is an excellent sales representative.  We had gone to a few other dealers and when we came to Symes I knew we found the right place.  Highly Recommend John Dajkovich!!!!<//text>

I have purchased several vehicles from Symes Cadillac over the years and Shanye Daniels has always shown a high level of expertise and support on every purchase. She truly cares about the customer experience and works to ensure that the purchasing process is stress-free. She is a great ambassador to both Symes and the Cadillac brand and I look forward to purchasing another vehicle through Symes in the near future.<//review>

Ever since I purchased my Cadillac in Nov of 2017 I have had nothing but problems with the truck and this dealer. They have failed to properly assist me and have not provided solutions to the problems with my truck. The issues are ongoing and all I get is the run around. I am truly dissatisfied with everything.< /Review>

My Mother is the one that owns the Cadillac I take it in for her each time for service or whatever is needed and every time I have an issue with the staff and every time I ask to speak to the manager they refuse me to talk to him or they will lie and say he's busy or can't come to the phone. But come to find out I talked to the Head store manager and he talked to the service manager and the service manager I said nobody ever told him I was trying to contact him. My LastPass experience was a man on the phone yelling at the top of his voice at me just because I was upset..he should have still stayed professional...Im so glad that the store MANAGER was nice and handle the situation for me.</text>

If you are ever interested in considering a Cadillac due yourself a favor and ask for Alex Salinas the Sales Manager. He is a very well mannered young man who understands how customer service works! When he said he was a no haggle manager he meant it and away we went with our beautiful ATS! Thank you Symes Cadillac and more importantly, Thank you Alex Salinas for erasing the typical car salesman stereotype.<//Text>

This Cadillac dealership has great customer service with knowledgeable and friendly People there to help you.
My mean gripe with this Cadillac dealership is they're the only ones I've ever been to that will not wash your Cadillac unlike Orange County, Long Beach, Riverside, etc.
I'm not sure if the Cadillac manager in charge is too cheap or if Manager doesn't want to be burdened with a Cadillac Owner wanting their car nice and clean.
Unlike the Infinity BMW Mercedes-Benz Porsche and all other Cadillac Dealerships.
I know one thing Mr. Symes,
When it comes time for me to Trade In my CTS Coupe and buy another one, I'll be going to other Cadillac Dealerships that are Willing to go the Extra Mile for their Customers.< /text>

I went by Symes Cadillac in Pasadena to check out the new XT5.  The sales person, Shayne Daniels greeted me with a warm smile and an exceptional knowledge base regarding the new model Cadillac. I'm a slow shopper and returned a couple of times with more question after a test drive. Shayne was a true patience professional and just a good person to deal with.< /Text>

I had a really good experience from the first day I walked in to the dealer.  Ramon assisted me and was very helpful very professional but most importantly to me  he wasn't your typical sales person (pushy or forcing a sale on me) he convinced me to take a look at a vehicle that he thought would make for a good deal for me based on what i told him i was looking for. after that he gave me his colleagues  name and contact info so that i had  2 people to get in contact with should the other not be able, her name was Shanye . this was unheard to me (in the car world), 2 sales people teaming up to make the sale. Ramon was off that weekend so I dealt with Shanye all weekend which was also amazing and very responsive via text this is so helpful with all the questions I had. and it also worked with my busy schedule that weekend. overall the whole process was great, they were very helpful and now im part of the Cadillac family.<//Review>

Outstanding vehicle. Good price. Great sales person. She had the vehicle out front and waiting for my test drive when I got there. She knew everything about the vehicle and its features and how to set and use them. She set up OnStar and traffic monitoring for me. (Traffic monitoring automatically changed my path home twice due to rush hour traffic issues.)  All things considered, this is probably the best auto and purchase experience I have ever had.<//text>

They continue to be best Cadillac dealer in SoCal! I always bring my CTS for service here though I live in West Hollywood. The team is great. Diana Zuniga is the best service advisor out of any place I have been. She knows about quality customer service. The whole Symes team is A+ but Diana Zuniga is the best make your appointment with her. They go beyond the quality of service you expect from Cadillac. There is no reason to go to anywhere else if you drive a GM car.

I bought the car from this dealer too! When I was shopping for a new car, my girlfriend and I went to almost every Cadillac dealer in the LA area, and no other dealer gave as great an impression as Symes did. You can easily tell that it is a family owned dealership because the feel in the store is more relaxed. Our salesman, Ray McInnis, was polite and extremely knowledgeable about the details and features of all the cars.  The finance manager, Joe Baba, is hilarious and he explained everything thoroughly. Shout out to Ramon for his help too!</Review>

Symes did a great job helping get my significant other in a new used car.
She is 100% happy with the dealership and It's staff.

Eric Romero and Alex did a great job this Is second car my family has bought from Symes and will continue to do so.  I would have no reservations recommending their staff and dealership to friends in need of a new or used car.

Oh, sure, the con-artist managers and minions smile and laugh with you.  Fantastic.  But, how about actually fixing my car?  I mean, actually fixing it instead of simply charging me and wasting me time to tell me you need me to look at it some more.

Ugh.

I ended up getting my car fixed at the other dealer (the one without all the manufactured fake-positive reviews; you know the one that actually fixes the car instead of giving you "lip-service").

The "service team" at Symes is more concerned with billing you than fixing your problem.  Specifically, I brought my Cadillac in and was was told they had no idea why my driver awareness package was not functioning.  Then after attempting to tell me that it was functioning and the problem may be that I "may not know how to use it" the service tech rammed into a plastic garbage container and answered "That's weird."

Yeah, that's "weird."  Moron.  Now how about telling me what is wrong and how to get it fixed?  Is that too much to ask from a dealer?

I repeatedly contacted the service manager directly, but he never responded.  When I went into see him in person, unannounced, he glad-handed me and made a lot of excuses, but still confessed no fault and most amazingly of all DISPLAYED ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAR.  I felt like he and his team were far better suited to service low-end Chevrolets than Cadillacs.

And lastly, the girl at the service counter repeatedly made promises to me regarding service, which then seemed to evaporate into the wind when I followed up.  The term "liar" comes to mind.  And to add insult to injury, she had the nerve to ask me to give her a great rating on the Cadillac survey.

Oh, h**l no.

Most importantly, I took the Cadillac elsewhere.  It was diagnosed and fixed the same day.  Yeah, the problem was a real "mystery" I suppose if you don't know what you are doing.

Ugh.

Worse luxury car service ever.</review>< Rate>

<review>I bought a new XT5 from Symes at the end of March. I'm still blown away by how well I was treated as a single, disabled woman shopping alone. I went to more than a dozen other car brand dealers before visiting Symes. I highly recommend them - they are a cut above everyone else. Not to mention that the Cadillac I bought is the best in its class.<//review><Name>Kim Neal<//Name>< Pics>

<Review>At first I was impressed with how the owner worked my deal... Then 3 months later I get a DMV renewal in the mail they (SYMES) PRO-RATED the registration what a crooked move and didn't tell me I was doing the DMV process transferring my personel plate to the new car and the owner walks in hands me my plate so I would have remembered being told this I would have NEVER agreed to a pro-rated dmv, registration then when I try to contact them about it I get ignored! then I report them to the BBB, and they even ignored the BBB, by NOT responding to them. Now I am stuck with a $575.00, DMV bill thanks a lot Matt Symes!!

All this after spending over 6 hours at the dealership! BEWARE!!
(See if they respond to this and how they'll try to cover their Butts!!)

UPDATE: 2/15/19: So I replied to their reply I copied and pasted my review along with their reply and sent it to them on Tuesday, I figured a week should be a sufficient amount of time for them to even reply, get back to me etc., but NOTHING as I stated they would reply to cover their butts! And that is all they did, so to give them another chance I did the same thing today let's see what happens... At this point you would be stupid to go there knowing how they're handling an issue as serious as this!

UPDATE: 03/04/19: SYMES DID COME THROUGH AND TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE THEY SENT ME A CHECK AND HAVE REDEEMED THEMSELVES... THANK YOU, MATT SYMES< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Salesman was friendly. Place was clean. Could have been brighter, as the whole place seemed a little dark. The reason for the low rating though is for the coffee machine. No coffee for your customers? It was my first time there, and was not impressed.</Text>

<text>Remember the saying: "that's the Cadillac of..."  well this place is the Cadillac of Cadillac Dealerships...

I've been coming to this dealership for a little over a year for service; everything has always been excellent, from customer service to the actual servicing of the vehicle.  Diana, my service assistant is always most accommodating, most attentive and helpful and most professional.  I can say the same about Oscar who has helped me when Diana has been unavailable.  I don't know the people that service my car personally, but I am grateful as they keep my car moving and they keep me safe.

Most recently, when changing my lease to a purchase, Shanye Daniels took it upon herself to help me.  She went above and beyond to find and explore every option that I could possibly consider, she took her time, never rushed or pressured me, when I asked her to revise things, she quickly did without question.  Her caring demeanor made the experience painless and her easygoing personality, while still remaining professional, made it comfortable for me to make a decision.

Highly, highly recommend Shanye and the entire staff at Symes Cadillac!   -- Vanessa R.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2db6322a1a26b:0x13e8aad01117396e</Gmap_id><UserId.>103063605931404385719</UserId.>< username>

I've bought and owned at least 20 cars over the years and find the process has been basic for the most part. Then I met Shanye Daniels and that all changed. She put up with my multiple texts and changes throughout the process and delivered me an amazing car, the best deal and above all, the most amazing service. This 2018 Escalade is nothing short of an awesome beast and she made it happen. Better than my last deal at a competing dealer who wouldn't step up to make my deal work. Shanye Daniels is your best choice for your Cadillac deal!<//Text>

<review>Literally the best car buying experience ever!!! I should mention that I am the kind of person to do A LOT of research before purchasing a car, and I can honestly say that I couldn't be happier with John D. at Symes! JOHN ROCKS!  Before going into Symes I had checked out other cadillac dealers for the XT5, and none of them were able to give me deal within the same ballpark as John. No joke within 2 texts John matched my offer and I went in for paperwork. It was so nice not having to play the negotiation game. If you are in the market for a Cadillac, or even any other car, I would HIGHLY recommend you go to Symes and ASK FOR JOHN D- THANKS JOHN; you rock! & thanks for entertaining us until finance cleared up!< /review>< gmapID>

<Review>Had a wonderful experience purchasing my car at Symes Cadillac. While I purchased a used car from another manufacture, the staff was very knowledgeable about the car.

My salesperson was Shanye Daniels who went way above and beyond all the other salespersons that I had dealt with recently. It was quite refreshing since I was coming from a couple of hours away and my past experiences were not the best. They worked pricing over the phone and we quickly settled on the final number. When I arrived they were expecting me and took care of the plethora of paperwork in short order.

I recommend this dealership and especially Shanye for anyone looking for a car!

She found the car I wanted when they didn't have one on the lot and made everything super easy and fun.  She's also very knowledgeable. If you're in the market for a Caddie, you can't do better than Symes and Shanye!< /Review>< date>

Ok I'm back on update on my Hummer H1 I took it in 5 to 6 months ago and they still have it and still waiting every time I call the part  it's back order I don't know if there's only one place to get parts for this vehicle in the whole United States or what ?  Customer service it's already embarrassed to talk to me I can hear it on her voice towards me  it's not her fault and to be honest don't know who's fault is but I'm kinda carless and planning to buy a new Cadillac but I'm thinking it twice if I need service thought I hope they resolve my problem soon  I'ma be with out a car for this whole year 😒< /Text>

I purchased an ATS through my Company's ( Real Estate Heaven)  Vehicle Bonus, Incentive program, whci now makes it 6 Cadillacs that our company has awarded to the Realtors.. The sales associate Kurtis Beckstron was great. he was extremely helpful and knowledgably from the moment I walked in. He made me feel at ease and comfortable with the entire process. He stayed in touch with me and updated me as to the progress of our transaction and the process of ordering the vehicle since we use the special Opulent Blue to match our Company color. At the delivery stage he walked me through all the gadgets and was extremely helpful in making sure I know as much about the car before driving off!  I would highly recommend Symes, the entire staff there, Especially Kurtis and I can't wait to go back to get my next Cadillac. I am driving in the clouds in my new ATS!!!  Thanks Symes!!!</text>

Today i purchased my 2013 Cadillac ATS from symes. i worked with  Arthur Khnkoyan And his Manager Harry Karpetyan. This two Gentleman are the best they were very Honest and Knowledgeable they gave me a great deal with the  car of my dreams.
It was fast easy and great we never played back and forth game like some other Dealers do.
Symes has great inventory of cars  state of the art Dealership and lots of refreshments and customer service. like a true luxury car dealership should be. they make Cadillac proud.
i differently will return for my future business and will refer all my friends with confidence.
Thank you again Arthur and Harry< /Review>

Just purchased a pre certified 2016 Cadillac and I could have not been happier. Shanye Daniels was our sales associate and did everything to help us out. She used her time to find the perfect car that would suit our family needs. I would highly recommend going to this dealership and talking to Shanye Daniels. Never did they pressure me to buy the car. They made sure I was happy with what I was buying. They don't play games like other dealerships do. They will not disappoint. Thank You Shanye!</Text>

My husband and I walked into Symes Cadillac Dealership this morning just to take a quick peek at the new 2017 Cadillac XT5 and of course to see if any banks would finance us. We didn't think we would be driving home with the XT5 today, but we did! We had the Best car buying experience ever!  Ms. Shanye, Cadillac's sales consultant, made the whole car buying experience that much better. She was very friendly, honest, funny, and will go above and beyond to get you in the Cadillac of your dreams. David in Finance worked his magic with the banks and Steve, the Big Boss, helped us seal the deal.  The best part was how the team at Symes Cadillac listened to us instead of telling us what we wanted to hear. Thanks to the wonderful team at Symes Cadillac Dealership, we have the XT5 in our garage. I recommend Symes Cadillac dealership to anyone thinking of buying a Cadillac for their next vehicle.<//review>

<review>If we could give this dealership more than 5 stars we would. we were not in the market for a Cadillac , but rather a ranger rover... and never had we been in a Cadillac.  we went to see a particular ranger rover, and didn't make a deal. came out were driving home and saw the escalade . we stop at Symes just to take a look.  the game changer for us was the sales lady, Cecile... from the minute she greeted us we knew we were in the right hands... it was raining that day but she was determined to get us the right car rain or shine... Edwin and I test drove the escalde and fell in love.  i always wanted a range rover but i was so impressed with Cecile warmth and honesty and presence that we give Cadillac a try and once we test drove that vehicle fell in love with the car too =).. it is such a smooth , well equipped car that we cannot say enough about it..  Cecile still wanted us to come back the next day, see the car in the day light and make sure we were happy with our decision... we have bought many many cars and been to many dealerships , and she has been the first sales person that made us feel comfortable with our purchase. that was very important to us. she treated us , complete strangers, as if we were her family... the next day, we purchased our first Cadillac. =)  Edwin and I are in love with our 2017 escalde and its all thanks to Cecile and symes in Pasadena.... she made the deal happen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   and their follow services amazing !!!!!!!!!  thank you and where ever we go we recommend Cecile!!!!!!!!!!!
if anyone is in the market for a suv or a luxury sedan, give cadillac a look you will be impressed .. Cecile is the Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!</review><date>1484335749576<//date><GmapID>0x80c2db6322a1a26b:0x13e8aad01117396e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If you're ever looking for a new or preowned Cadillac, go see Shanye Daniels at Symes Cadillac! She's professional, and knowledgeable! A very low haggle process and made my DTS purchase a pleasant experience!
Not only was she able to find the exact one I was looking for, she went well beyond her duties to assist me with scheduling my servicing needs. While I thought something was up with my car, she promptly got me into the service department and reserved a loaner vehicle. The concern was addressed and it turns out everything was just fine! Thanks Shanye!</Text>< user_name>

I had such a great experience buying my used car and trading in my old car with Symes.  Other dealerships I went to were pushy, old-fashioned, and the salespeople acted like, well, used car salesmen!  At Symes, Shanye Daniels was upbeat, not pushy, but super helpful, and listened to my needs (She also texted, which was great, as I was getting a slew of annoying phone calls from other dealerships!!).  She worked hard to work within my budget, and with her and Abel Zaragoza's help, I was able to drive off the lot with my awesome Jeep within a week!  I never felt pressured to spend more than I originally stated, and I felt respected, which is invaluable in a car buying experience.  Thank you again, Shanye and Abel, for your amazing customer service.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I went into Symes Cadillac to look at the all new 2014 Cadillac CTS. I was quickly approached by a young woman SHANYE DANIELS. She welcomed me into the showroom, quickly introduced herself and showed me a CTS right in the showroom. I mentioned that it's my first time looking at Cadillac and that I was in the beginning "just looking" stages.

I must say Shanye made my car shopping experience hassle free. She understood that I wanted to look at a few other cars in it's class. She didn't pressure me, we went on a test drive and I was impressed with her knowledge of Cadillac and other luxury cars on the market. I will definitely consider Cadillac after I'm done shopping and would highly recommend my friends/family going to see Shanye Daniels for a new Cadillac.</Text>< Pics>

<text>​I recently purchase a new CTS 2014 from the Pasadena Symes Cadillac. The experience is surely completely satisfy. I moved to Pasadena and the Symes Cadillac is so close so I walk there to check out the new cars. My sales agent Shanye Daniels was very friendly, she knew that I was not ready to make a decision. However, she spent time with me and explain the policy of the purchase and the knowledge of the new cars. I was thinking between BMW and Cadillac, and this sales agent Shanye is the reason why I chose Cadillac at the end. The BMW agents do not the same quality like Shanye. As a customer, we are also looking for the customer service for post-purchase period.  During my second visit, it was last and Shanye stayed with me till 8pm, such nice agent! So, I finally got the CTS and it was fantastic that I do not need to worry about any problem after the purchase, I could just call Shanye and she will handle the problem for me. I will definitely promote Shanye to be the best sales agent in Pasadena Symes. The manager at this location is also very nice, Alex Salinas, they help me to simplify things so that I could enjoy the fine coffee they provide.

By the way, they also gave me a nice gift box with business card holder and key chains. that is $100 value. Nice! But, I do not guarantee the gift box every time. Anyway, it was a completely satisfy and fun experience. Give it a shot and ask for Shanye Daniels, you will not be disappointed.

This looks like I am promoting the stores and the sale agent too much, hahaha, but what can I say. Pasadena is a beautiful city and the people here are Wonderful. :)< /text></record>

I recently visited Symes Cadillac (since they're the closest Cadillac to me) Shanye was my salesperson, she understood everything I wanted and needed in a new car and was able to get me into a beautiful 2013 Cadillac SRX.

Buyer beware,  purchased a used cts with low miles. Shortly after the breaks started squeaking and the electronic latch for truck stopped working,  when I brought it back less then a three months later they said there was nothing they could do because I didn't get the extended warranty.  Which when buying they insisted that I didn't need because the car was still under warranty.  Yeah, for another month! Swindlers.<//review>

Bought a car, used without a warranty. AFTER purchasing, I was handed a single key fob and told, "By the way, sorry, we only have one key."
I was surprised and dissapointed by this information, but even more so after getting a quote for a new one for almost $400. My call to Symes concerning the fob was not returned.<//Review>

This spot is my preferred one. I go to plenty of restaurants but to this restaurant I go the most. The team is very welcoming and the cuisine they serve is so flavorful. I am always happy to have a nice dinner in this restaurant. Highly recommended.< /Review>

Service was horrible. The cook was laughing and talking while making the pizzas - so unsanitary (spit)! The $5 pizza was cold. They take the saying “You get what you pay” to a whole new level! I’ll be returning to Little Caesars Pizza!!!</review>

This is what the delivery woman stated when she dropped off the pizza. I ordered a vegetarian pizza with jalapeños onion,mushrooms,green peppers and olives. With half pepperoni. The ordered arrived with no japapeños. I called them and after getting pushed around to different people finally I had had enough. I said I want the pizza I ordered or my money back. They made the pizza but this time when they brought the pizza they haf put all the vegetable ingrediants on one side and half pepperoni. Completely horrible. They keep pushing the fault on the customer and dont own up to it. I also ordered the 12 piece chicken hot wings which taste awful and are not even dipped in hot sauce looks like they are only marinated. They dont taste fried or oven baked they taste boiled. Couldnt even eat them. I Told her I ordered 12 and she said they only do 10 pieces. This place is thrash. Dont waste your money or time.

This has been the fourth time eating there. The first three were horrible. Food was good, but order was wrong Everytime, took forever, and had to return to get forgotten items. This last time was good, even though they forgot to give me the dipping sauce for my wings.  I only go because it's close by and different from what I'm bored of<//Review>

< Review>
I love pizza loca but Papa John is now a force to be recond with. NO FROZEN DOUGH.  I though I have reached the pinnacle of cheap inferior pie, but no I ran out of gas in a Papa Johns P.L. and what do you know bam 5 DOLLAR PIE AND NO FRO PIE DOUGH. so course I do the reasonable thing and spend my gas money on PIZZA.  And let me tell you.  I ate like a king for a day.  And saved the free garlic sauce for a 49 cent reduced bin loaf of bread.  The perfect follow-up to my new bestest eatery. Papa Johns. Sorry Pizza Loca Im leaving you for Papa John or as I like to call him Papi chulo John's.<//Review>

We ordered a pizza around 3:45 in the afternoon. By 5:10 we had not received it. We called to check up on it but we got hung up right after the person who answered the call said it was already delivered. We call again, this time the person let's us have an actual conversation so we place another order and they said they will deliver it within an hour. An hour passes, two, and it was never delivered. We often buy pizza from this place and I've come to know the delivery people as they too recognize me from all the times they have dropped it off. I was really disappointed. They should have called if there was something holding them from delivering the pizza.< /Text>

<review>Knowledgeable staff and convenient hours.  Service is great.  The only complaint is I was emailed a $25 coupon for accessories. I went in to buy a charging cable and not even the employees knew you had to spend a least $50 to use the coupon. Ended up being a pricey cable. I still gave you 5 stars because the staff is great but that was a little disappointing.< /review><time>1622597564299< /time>< user_name>

She explained my options, found discounts and was incredibly personable. She made me feel important and was there to get me the best in equipment that will meet my specific needs because of my job. She listened to my needs and got me what I wanted not what she thought I should have! She was super efficient and walked me thru the basics of my new phone before I left and said to call her with any questions. You are very lucky to have such a personable and professional employee! I will be recommending her to my friends.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1610578735649, 'text': 'Thank you for the Five-Star rating, Diane!

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>We live in Mammoth and drove to Bishop to buy 2 new iPhone 11s. Nora, the manager, was expecting us and met us as we entered. She spent a lot of time with us and handled all of our concerns and needs. We are not very technical, so she was patient and helped us separate our common Apple ID and established 2 individual accounts.

We are very pleased with her customer service, product and Covid-19 protocols.<//Review><date>1603382918059<//date></record>

<review>She was full of joy, she was extremely helpful with my questions. She explained things very well. I purchased a few items from the store to help support the charity. Michelle and Jymie both had great hospitality. They are wonderful clerks for verizon.They are wonderful clerks for verizon. (I do have an issue that needs to be addressed. There was another girl that was the Store Manager that was not wearing a mask. I wouldn't of known she was a manager due to her attire. The other agents were apologetic. It is Mandatory in California and Inyo County to wear a mask in all businesses or public areas. I get masks are a pain but that was ridiculous. I would confronted her but she ended up leaving for a while. During a pandemic and seeing someone in a Management position is appalling. Very unprofessional and it was obvious there was lack of care/concern for customers. But the help that was provided by the two agents were professional and I appreciated both Michelle and Jymie. I do recommend both these agents for assistance.<//review><rating>5< /rating><Time>1602101075496</Time></record>

<text>Such a beautiful store, there was a new trainee young lady that was super helpful, the store manager was over seeing her work as she took care of us. Both employees made our experience so grateful and smooth. We are from Orange county and were down for snowboarding and stopped to get our 10 year old son an iPhone 8. Beautiful experience should give these employees something for their awesome work ethics and helpfulness.< /text>< rate>

Daniel in the store was super helpful and generous. Thank you! The screen on my phone broke and I needed help navigating my options: trying for warranty, filing an insurance claim or buying another phone. I had tons of questions and was committed to being thorough in order to choose the best option for me. He made phone calls for me, researched on the internet. We were a team and eventually realized the best choice. This was a huge help in such a vulnerable time (oh no, my phone!). Thanks Daniel and Ensignal in Bishop for the great service.</Text>

Nely the manager was the nicest there has ever been i, stopped coming into this store when the old manager was in I did come in one last time and Nely was here and i will forever be greatful. Came in for help with my phone and walked out with 2 new upgrade and a watch and added protection on them and traded in our old devices walked out with little money spent and a bill close to what we were originally paying!!!! This is My Verizon Store for sure as long as she is still here!!</Text>

With the Verizon network out all day, it was a trying day for this salesman, but he hung in there and was incredibly courteous!!  Awesome sales rep.   I will go back when Verizon is actually working and people aren't walking in every minute!</Text>

<text>Went into this store thinking it was an actual Verizon Store... Purchased a SG6 and my wife got a phone too. The phone she got was a part of a deal to get a samsung tablet. The tablet was "free" with the additional benefit of having a lowered price on my wife's phone.

Zoom 16 months later and i'm having a tight month... looking to cut back where i can i see a device payment of $30 and a line fee of $10.

I call Verizon and they tell me they can't find the "deal" that I had this "free" tablet from. They offer a credit of just over $100 to send it back.. I am displeased but accept the credit and send it back in. The next bill i got had a device return fee for $80 even though they assured me they would make an exception to that fee.

I calculated what I had spent over the 16 months on that tablet (16 * $40) to be over $600 and could not tolerate this loss so I canceled my Service with Verizon... Later on I look into this business and find out it is not even a Verizon store but a Verizon Authorized Dealer...

My advice, DO NOT SHOP WITH THEM! THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS!!

I was in the other authorized Verizon dealer's shop whom i had been with prior and had treated me well (They also don't trick you into thinking they are a Verizon Store). He noted several occasions of complaints with this Ensignal on billing related issues.

The only way I EVER will consider changing my mind on this business is if they pay that money back to all the people they have overcharged.

TLDR
Sold false deals, Not just to me, Scam Artists.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
Went in here to buy the S9+ and I explained I wanted to buy it outright so I didnt have any payments on it. The employee, Nely Marquez, said yeah, no problem so I made my $1109.14 payment with my debit card. The next month, I look at my bill and see that she left 24 cents remaining on my device payment. What a slimy tactic she used by lying to me. She did this so she could earn comission on my phone that I wanted to pay for 100% upfront. I called Verizon and told them what happened and they told me that the employee shouldn't have done that and that they will be taking action about it. Avoid this place. They'll act nice to your face but don't give a lick about the customers specific request. You have been warned!</Review>

Bishop and Mammoth verizon are the worst! I went to the bishop verizon for a week and they told me that it was closed three hours earlier ,even thought they closed at 8!!! Then the last time I went during that week, the manager saw us and completely ignored us, because they posted that same day a new schedule for "Winter hours"even thought its  about summer really soon!! After loosing my patients, I went to the verizon in mammoth and they gave me the same treatment and made me look so stupid and called me a liar!!! The manager and the staff  didn't even have a clue on what they were doing !!!!!
I can't believe how terrible verizon is in these two towns!!!! Thank the lord I'm switching carrier!!! I'm never going back with verizon ever again!!! They are a piece of garbage!!! I hope they close both of them for good!!<//review>

<Text>Ordered a phone to be picked up in the store, 2 hours later the order was cancelled. After talking to Verizon they informed me the store cancelled my order, and they don't know why. Went to the store that day Aug 29th 2pm to talk to an employee, and she told us because someone else ordered that phone earlier that week they cancelled our order....like wait what? So your out of stock? Why not just order us one to? The employee didn't offer any advice or suggestions. This caused major issues on our Verizon account which messed up the upgrade eligibility, and causing me to spend the next 2 hours dealing with Verizon reps online and via phone. Absolute appalling customer service.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Cell phone and accessories sales store for different brands and models.
Good service, clean and tidy premises.
Perhaps they should provide more service for customers in the pre-paid service !!.

<Review>A before and after of our fur baby - we love coming here for grooming. Every one who works there is pleasant and really good with the dogs. They're calm, patient and loving. We absolutely love that she doesn't get locked in a kennel for hours as other dogs are getting bathed and groomed. She gets to roam free in the grooming and small dog areas. They always do a great job with the hair cuts and bathing. They also clean out her ears and trim her nails.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpYN0GNrK8L52g1JoSPESLlvr11JEkQ7F-lMK4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_gH-Xru_R3lpmXgkogDVhhYUzpXt-pegdMhWT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Place is really nice since it’s so close to my work. The staff is always extremely friendly and knew my dogs name after the first visit. It’s a little pricey but so is most day care. Cameras are a nice touch can log in and watch from anywhere. My pup loves water so their play fountains are perfect for him. Highly recommend this place.< /Review>

They really looked after and cared for my dog when I went to another state for a family engagement. He was too nervous to play with the other dogs so the groomers let him stay with them for the 5 days I was gone. They pet and loved on him so much so that he was calmer than I've ever seen him, and he was relaxed when I came back.  I am also Very pleased with the amenities for  the little dogs, like a KITCHEN, and little wading areas. Also the option to have your dog sleep slumber party style on giant pillows, or in separate crates. It even smells good in there
I loved that they have staff on duty overnight, so mu guy wasn't alone and scared.<//Text>

<review>After 1. 5 years without any problems, my puppy Duke was attacked unprovoked by a pack of dogs at Bone Adventure. As you can see from the photos he has multiple wounds from a prolonged unattended incident. This happened while the owner Diane Cuniff was away on a ski trip in Utah. They will not let us see the video of the attack and have giving us many half truths.We have unpaid vet bills in the thousand of dollars and a company more interested in packing in the profits then the proper care of animals. Yes the dogs who did this are still there!.😡  If your dog has experienced similar problems, please contact us.<//review></record>

Food was great and so was the service. The only problem was the wait and that's because they are so busy because it's a great place to go to.</review>

<Text>My wife & I travel for work a lot, having a place that our dog LOVES to go to for daycare & boarding is a huge help. The staff is always very friendly and knows our pup on sight. We tried a few other places, but our dog would always come back scared and sad, the Bone Adventure is her favorite place to be after the park!< /Text>< userid>

<text>We have been taking our dog here for years. We have notice things getting worse. Too crowded and lack of oversight. We pay a a lot for this service. Our dog keeps getting sick from the other dogs. You bring it up to the staff and it falls in deaf ears. We found a new day care and now our dog likes going to day care again. B.A. was great. But not anymore.  I see greed and not care for my dog. They have a lot of dogs packed into there. I am sure they won't miss our business. I would never take my dog back there. Feel guilty for not finding her better care sooner. Also much cheaper now. 1/2 the price.<//text>< user>

Been bringing my dog here for over 5 years. I've only ever had to do use their daycare services, but couldn't be happier. The facility has something for whatever mood my dog is in throughout the day. There is plenty of room to roam and wrestle with his buddies, but also plenty of shady spots to take a snooze. The best part is how tired he is when I pick him up.< /text>

I love to take him to Bone Adventure. They always greet him by name and are genuinely as excited to see him as he is them.

<username>Katelynn McDougall<//username><review>We took our puppy here for the Swim Club and he had a blast!

He never swam before but always wanted to jump in, so the intro class they taught him how to properly get out of the pool and the doggy life jacket was perfect for him since he really didn't know how to swim.

His first swim class was free and it was with a small group his 2nd visit was $20 for 30 mins and I felt so bad making him get out of the pool because he had so much fun! They did mix in some of the boarded dogs with the swimming pups so it was a little chaotic at times.

Parking is easy and the location is hidden behind trees from the street so our puppy like being farther from the street since that scares him.

You NEED to check out the swim club especially if your pup is curious about getting in the water!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Can't say enough good things about this place! If you want to splurge on your dog.. definitely do it here. This place is like Disneyland for dogs! The staff look like they do a good job of taking care of the dogs. This is a really nice place where dogs can roam around and play safely..and if you're not sure you can check the web cams! My dog always has a great time here. Not the cheapest doggie daycare place around but definitely the most fun.</review>

<review>Slay, my 1 year old Siberian Husky,  LOVES it here! The backyard location , specifically, on Bristol Street in Costa Mesa, even has a huge pool the dogs can play with each other in (supervised, of course) which always tires out my very energetic and very sweet puppy. 1000% reccommended. Like day camp for dogs :)<//review><user_name>sarah pastor< /user_name>< GmapID>

There are always friendly staff who are enthusiastic about caring for your pet and the facility is amazing! I love that they don't cage or kennel your dog at all. The dogs get to sleep wherever they like to and there is  always a human with them 24/7. Love this place!</Review>< Pictures>

Groomers are quick and almost always available. They offer filing/Dremel services, which is really helpful if your dogs' nails tend to stay Sharp for a while after cutting.

My dogs always have a blast when they stay here for day care.< /review>

<Text>Left my puppies there for boarding while on Christmas break and they lost almost 10lbs.  I couldn't believe the negligence they had towards our dogs.  I didn't get any phone calls and it seems they missed a lot of meals and no one cared.  Had to take them to vet and put them on IV.  Stay away if you love your dog.< /Text>< Pictures>

They take great care of my lab dane! Dogs are cage free.. Your dog is going to love this place.  Mine is excited when we arrive and exhausted  when we pick him up.  The staff is friendly and loves the dogs. You can watch your dog through the cameras. We have been coming to this location for over seven years.  Our dog was just a pup. Remember to make reservations  for over night stays.</Review>

This place is the BEST! We've taken our dog to many daycares and none compare. It's so big and open with tons of play things for the dogs. They treat them really well and the icing on top if how affordable it is! We like it so much, even though we moved up to Santa Monica, we drive all the way down to OC on any of our extended trips so he can stay here.</Review>

I have never been so happy as a dog owner, this place took my 2 dogs 1 who has never been in water m, not my choice lol and when I returned was swimming like a rescue dog. Now everytime I say swim or pool they both go absolutely crazy knowing they are about to be with friends and one we now call family. It's a must for all dog owners.< /review>

<userid>107592705861894953281</userid><Review>Doggy Disneyland. Love this place for the kids. My big boy dis come back with, what looks to be, a bite mark. I know the kids like to play rough sometime abd he is ok but just wondering why i got no report. And it seem like he had a bark collar on when i picked him up? They said wasn't. So wondering about the scab on his neck. Im sure no one saw is all...not worried its already healing and he's not complaining.

Don't let that deterr you seriously we have been going here a long time and everyone is great. I still bring them there and will continue. Just know that sometimes kids will be kids. And as a pup parent i will make sure to request no special collars and ask for a report before leaving.<//Review><username>Wendy Legerton</username><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>4</Rating><date>1503086859663<//date><gmapID>0x80dcdf1ab8ccb899:0x650cb6f986895250< /gmapID><resp>None</resp></record>

< Review>
EXCELLENT Service, Location... and GOOD FOOD: healthy, fresh, organic and tasty!!!! No SODAS! But the lemonade basil is so yummy! It's a place worth the drive from Irvine to Dana Point. The appetizer with the salmon... delicious! The different types of combination salad with a topping if steak or salmon... totally filling! The chicken dish ... sorry, can't remember (starts with a "p") ... flavor was divine, smoked edge ... just delicious! Sorry but neither my mom who ordered the appetizer or my brother who ordered the chicken plate and I with the spring salad and salmon have no left overs! That's how delicious and perfectly portioned the meals were. Yummy to the moon and back.</Review>

Delicious breakfast. Everything was so good. And it was a friends birthday, and they brought her out a weird thing called a Dutch something. That was heavenly!  It was like a thick eggy pancake.</Text>

Exceeded my expectations. Everything was so yummy here! And the eggs were cooked perfectly - both over hard & poached. And the coffee was fire. They have really good cashew milk and really tasty latte flavors. There's plenty of parking, but we came early and parked at the harbor. Overall waited about 20 minutes for seating outside on a beautiful day.< /Text>

I bring my dad here for his birthday and they always give him a little treat with a candle so that I can sing Happy Birthday to him. The food is mostly organic and absolutely delicious. The owner and the staff are super nice. My dad is Italian and he loves the pastas. This is a must try place to go. You will definitely be going back. Love you guys at Maison  Cafe & Market!!!</Text>

What a great find!  We decided to this little gem because it was walking distance from our hotel.  The food was so flavorful, light but filling and everyone was friendly.

We ordered the duck confit toast and the cured salmon plate and basil lemonade.</text>

Delicious food and really neat atmosphere. Also very close to the beach and Dana Point.

Will definitely be back to try other brunch dishes.

Scramble dish was good but I highly recommend getting the hot sauce with it. It should be a standard accompaniment.</review>

They have the best food and the service is wonderful! I have never had a mediocre item on the menu. Every time I try something new I love it! We had the flat bread and whippped burrata and chicken entree. Amazing! Also THE COOKIE is to die for. It was so refreshing to have non alcoholic options. I recommend this place to everyone!

Danielle, the owner, and Andrew, my favorite waiter, are just awesome! Everyone at Maison Cafe has become like my second family. Not only is the food amazing but the service is beyond expectation!

My must have dishes:

1. Whipped Burrata
2. Steak and Eggs
3. Dutch Baby <— get it as a dessert

This is our absolutely favorite place in Cali. My husband and I go a couple mornings and it never disappoints. The food is phenomenal and fresh, the service is great, and the owner even rounds and checks in. The vibes are on point and it just has such a cozy CA coast feel. A MUST TRY if you’re ever in the Dana Point area! ☺️ All the stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</text>

Great spot.  Front wall opens as folding panels.  Food is delicious!  Homemade cashew milk for those of us who prefer that in our latte.  I recommend Maison!< /review>

Maison Cafe is a gem! The decor is warm and cozy and reminded me of a  cafe you would see in the back country of Italy. The menu is specifically selected using the best organic ingredients available by season.   My choice was the Turmeric Hummus Appetizer and Wine. My heart filled with joy when my bountiful and colorful plate of healthy goodness arrived to my table! The flavors were so delicious.  Owner Danielle's belief and vision is that we all deserve healthy, organic and delicious food - I can say she has perfected it.  She visits with her guest and when I met her briefly I could sense she is a very special soul leaving her own positive footprint on this earth one plate at a time.  When you are in the mood for a "Getaway" step inside Maison Cafe + Market.< /Text>

Don’t let the strip mall location throw you off, this is a great spot.  They use good ingredients and great flavor combos.  They don’t make the bread in house, but they at least buy a quality loaf.  Love this place!  Highly recommend the chèvre toast w the scrambled eggs.<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>I went mid week last fall it was empty except 1 big party, I ordered the duck pita/flat bread per the servers suggestion and a meat dish “Osso bucco” to go along with a house red wine. The wine I had while I waited for the food to be ready the wine was good but came in regular glass over a long stem wine glass which seemed a lil’ low brass to me. The food was ready fairly fast and both the Osso bucco and duck bread were good but the Osso was very small portion and the “to go” box they put it made it fall all over the place and it looked like a mess over the proper way a main should look, also in my option the duck bread at $18 was very expensive for just pocket bread with some small pieces of duck thrown on. Also if I’m paying even $7 for a glass of house wine I’d hope to get it in a proper glass. The total was $54 which seemed very high for the little food I got and how it came especially from a simple restaurant inside a strip mall. It’s a nice place to bop into if you want to try something diff and money isn’t an option(seemed like a trendy motif). But I wouldn’t take a date here nor go if your expecting something very good at there high prices. Presentation lacks as well as portion size.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Ordered the wild mushroom tartine. It was delicious!! Rich mushroom flavor with aromatic gyuere cheeses.

The Dutch baby was extraordinary. It's not the traditional kind, it's fluffy, soufflé like texture. Similar to the famous Japanese soufflé pancakes. The flavor is quite creamy as well.< /text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love love love places like this that know how to cook real food bake real desserts and pies and savories and have that panache to boot they know they're making some of the best food in Orange county, super low-key, super low prices, wide variety. normally I expect a restaurant like this to have no real food selection sure they'd have salads and and croissants or even better baked goods than that per se but this place legitimately has excellent entrees for dinner and it's worth taking a trip for the ambiance and French Apple Tarte Tatín alone.</text>< Date>

Truly a remarkable experience. You would have no idea that such a gem existed in this particular strip mall, the quality is on par with high end resorts and is at a fair price if not a bargain. Please come and give this place the attention it deserves.< /Review>

<Review>My mom and I are always on the hunt for exquisite French restaurants. This one is unusual because its upscale and understated at the same time. The dress code is casual and the vide is industrial but country, too, and the food is marvelous.
Just wonderful. I had the Mushroom Tartine and my mom had the Duck Confit Tartine. Both were delicious and just perfectly light and filling. We also each had a basil lemonade which was fantastically refreshing. The parking here is a pain. The lot is tiny and people are going in and out to shop at the surf store next door. Nonetheless I would come back anytime.
The server was attentive.
My mom had taken me here for the croissants which are made fresh daily, but we were too late. Our server indicated they are usually gone by noon. We didn't get seated until 1pm. The wait was only about 20 minutes for a party of 2, and it was definitely worth it (I don't say that often).< /Review>< UserId.>

What a charming spot. Our waiter turned out to be the son of the chef, and when we got a chance to chat with her we were delighted by her thought put into the menu. On top of the charm, the food was phenomenal.

I had the osso bucco, tender as any I’ve had. My wife got the leek pie and a salad with salmon we ended up taking home as the portions were sizeable. But I made sure to suck all the marrow and chew all the meat off my dish, because it was that tasty. Excited to come back for more. I just wish more folks in this neck of the woods would be down for tartare! Restaurants don’t serve it because not many order it. Same goes for pate... delicious and nutritious. Vote with your dollars :)< /text>

Ah what a great spot in Dana Point. Just over the PCH from Doheny, the location is a bit of a hidden gem still (although definitely was buzzing this morning).

If you’re looking for sweet, look no further than the Dutch Baby: Light and airy, covered in fruit and marscapone. But the menu is tight, healthy and manicured to maximize taste!

Also, get the mimosas!< /Review>

This is one of our favorite restaurants in south Orange County. Amazing food whether you’re going for breakfast lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed. Literally everything on the menu we have eaten is delicious! You must try it if you’re in the area!!!</Text>

What a fantastic little spot. We had a great experience dining at Maison.

The staff is extremely friendly and acommodating. They are attentive, know the menu, and are genuine in conversation, even on a busy Sunday. We even took our 21 month old and never felt like a burden.

The menu isn't huge, which is intentional and works well, like your meal is a presentation. It is concise, well thought out, and excellent. Each dish is unique and contributes in it's own way, and the quality of the food is wonderful for such an affordable meal.

Great use of space, pleasing decor and enough elbow room between tables so you aren't sharing your conversation with the rest of the patrons. They frosted the windows, which is a nice touch to diffuse the light throughout the dining room, leaving it cheery and welcoming.

I plan on visiting regularly.<//text>

<Review>Love this place!  Favorites include the avocado toast and the roasted root veggie bowl for breakfast.  At lunch the Chicken Salad or the mushroom tartine are my standards, but whatever you choose you will be delighted!  Oh!  The warm Olive appetizer is delicious and enough to share.<//Review></record>

Friendly staff, Food is very good, atmosphere is pleasant.   Parking can be challenging and there often can be a wait for a table. But a French cafe should never run out of Croissants and they often do.<//review>

You absolutely must have breakfast/brunch here and lunch and dinner  - try all the yummy dishes!! So glad to have such a great, unique spot in Dana Point!! Thank you :) I adore the little details and the love that was obviously poured into every recipe on the menu. This place is a favorite for sure!! ♡♡<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I've been here several times and the food is fantastic. I've tried several dishes and each one was perfect. They'll substitute for you and help with a request you may have. No problem. Staff is excellent. Maison is becoming very popular very quickly so I suggest making reservations for busy times.<//Review>< Time>

An incredibly unique & delicious cafe.  Danielle, the owner, has put together the full package - healthy food choice, a wine & beer list of small batch producers & perhaps the most informed service staff around.  A great experience for any meal.  And they cater with choices as unique and well presented as their cafe menu.< /review>

First. Everything if not 90% of everything is organic and almost all is locally sourced (at least what I have ordered)

Second. You can feel the love infused into the food as you eat it (just like how grandma did it).

Third. Wine list is top notch. Very Comparable selection if not one of the top in the area.

Fourth. Staff is super friendly. They remember my order on coffee which is cool. Always happy and smiles

Try them out. At least twice. And get the duck confit appetizer. It’s amazing.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Get here early for their daily spread of goodies.  The peanut butter toast I had was ok.  Not my favorite for the price.  The wait staff is great.  My only complaints would be their eggs and the sit down menu.  I will always come here early for the baked goods though.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x80dcf17d9eeebaed:0x1a6963192667f418<//gmap_id>< Date>

<Response>{'time': 1566443317846, 'text': 'Hi Christian,\nThank you so much for your recent visit! I would love to know what else you ordered to get your bill to $100? The 6 oz. grass fed/finished Steak and Eggs dish we offer with organic eggs is only $18, the Dutch Baby (which we agree is phenomenal) is only $12 and the oat meal is $9. That only totals up to $39! Sounds like a pretty killer deal for the quality of ingredients you get when you dine with us. Did you have mimosas, or were there other dishes that you enjoyed with us? We look forward to seeing you soon!'}< /Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rate>

<review>We went here for breakfast. It is a cute decor and enjoyable atmosphere. We were kinda sad, when we looked at the menu though. Almost everything had eggs and nuts in it. I like eggs, but my son is allergic and my husband doesn't care for eggs. My son is also allergic to nuts. It would be great if they added a kids menu, got more than 2 high chairs, and offered a bit more variety than eggs over salad in various ways. Service was great and what we ordered was tasty, just hoping for a bit more variety in the future.<//review>< pics>

<Response>{'time': 1547093830184, 'text': "Hi Danielle! Thank you for your recent visit with us. There are tons of options without nuts and most of the items can be made to accommodate any egg allergies. Eggs can always be substituted for veggies or asparagus.  There are bowls, breakfast plates, toasts, salads, tartines and more... only a handful have eggs and/or nuts. Next time you're in, ask for Danielle and I'll make sure we find something on our menu that works for everyone. As for the high chairs, our storage is limited and at the moment we only have the two.. but all of the staff love the littles, most of us are moms, so feel free to hand off the little one :) see you soon! - Danielle"}</Response><GmapID>0x80dcf17d9eeebaed:0x1a6963192667f418<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

YES, YES, YES! What a wonderful new spot in Dana Point. The food, the sevice, the experience... it was all absolutely amazing. You can find some unique dishes made from the best ingredients. The only problem is narrowing it down. We will 100% be back (many, many time). I highly recommend this place. Plus, its owned and managed locally!<//Review>

<Time>1553201909325< /Time><Rating>2</Rating><Review>Waited to sit, waited to order, waited to eat and waited for the check. We were there for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, and it only took about 15 to eat, so don’t come planning on an hour lunch. (We were a party of 5) I had my 1 year old with me and after an hour of waiting asked for a piece of toast or something to tide him over until the food arrived. It took 15 minutes to bring out two slices of bread for a crying baby?

Also don’t come with a big appetite! Not a lot of food, especially for the price. Good quality ingredients, but some dishes lacked balance. I couldn’t taste certain elements because others were too overpowering. (I’m looking at you prosciutto tartine). Enjoyed the grain salad though!

Definitely checks all the boxes for trendy local cafe. Would probably come back if it wasn’t for all the waiting around we did.<//Review>< pics>

<resp>{'time': 1553232986494, 'text': 'Jane, I am so sorry that you were so disappointed with pretty much it sounds like everything today. I\'m not sure if you\'re visit with us was today or another day, but either way it sounds like you were less than pleased.\n\nAll of the tables in the restaurant are designed to seat parties of two or four, and that combined with an amazing full restaurant at lunch most likely led to you being placed on our wait list. We do our best to seat parties in a timely manner, but also stand firm on the belief that Maison means home and we never want guests to feel rushed to leave when they are done dining with us. My sincerest apologies if the wait was longer than expected for your lunch break.\n\nBeing a mom myself, I can\'t even imagine how my kids survived eating out in the era before ipads and baby shark! I know that part of it was due to the never ending supply of cheerios, juice boxes and crayons that I kept stashed in every pocket of my diaper bag! I know that 5 seconds can seem like an eternity when your baby is crying and I\'m sorry that our made to order toast wasn\'t as speedy as you would have liked (cheerios are handy little things).\n\nOur dishes are all designed with the freshest, best organic ingredients possible with the mindset that you should never leave a restaurant with a "grease gut" but instead leave energized and ready for the next adventure of the day! Our prosciutto tartine is one of our favorites with our house made creamy ricotta, dressed organic arugula, salty prosciutto, roasted heirloom tomatoes and sweetened balsamic reduction... what\'s not to love! Talk about an umami bomb, you are hitting each of the major senses of flavor in one of our most popular lunch dishes, perhaps not for everyone, but definitely one that most enjoy. We love the grain salad too and are glad you enjoyed it as well!\n\nWe like to think of what we do at Maison as classic with a twist, focusing on only bringing the absolute best in food, hospitality and ambiance to each and every guest that walks in our door.'}</resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Came in on a weeknight and thoroughly enjoyed a meal here.  Started off with clams, moved on to the caprese salad, and had the bistecca with chimichurri sauce as my entree.  All items were fantastic.  I live in LA but will be back if I'm back town.</Review>

<Text>It' not a special occasion restaurant.   We started coming here several months ago and we were blown away initially by the food.  But now that we have had a chance to come back repeatedly we find that some of the same issues stand. Number one it's very noisy and the environment is impersonal which some people would say is relevant to a bistro, but you have to keep in mind you're in a strip mall off of Pacific Coast Highway, not on Paris. The salmon that was on our salad was pretty much flavorless and was overcooked  If you were to compare it to a local restaurant in San Juan Capistrano called Ciao Pasta you would be very underwhelmed. Our Coq Au Vin was over cooked and undersauced.
That being said, service was just fine and they were on top of things. Great place to go for good food and good friends to just catch up.< /Text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1563342536375, 'text': "Hi Stephanie, thank you so much for joining us and for continuing to come in on multiple occasions, whether if it was for a special event or just to catch up over good food and a glass of wine.\n\nBeing that you yourself are a small business owner, I'm confused as to why you wouldn't voice any of your concerns to your server or myself as I'm sure we've had a chance to talk on one if not more of your visits. I'm sorry that the food disappointed you and can assure you that we would have either taken care of your meal or replaced it if you had let us known that there was any sort of problem or dissatisfaction of the dishes, I actually love getting feedback from guests and will always be disappointed when someone would rather say everything is ok, just to later leave a poor review on a business that has heart, soul and determination in every ounce of what we do.\n\nI love the sound of the dining room and although it can get a bit boisterous... it reminds me of being home with tons of family and friends on the holidays or just a good old fashioned get together... even if we are in a goofy little strip mall in Dana Point rather than France.\n\nWishing you the best success in your business and I do hope that if ever one of your clients finds room for improvements in what you do on a daily they give you an opportunity to hear it before they tell their friends, family member or strangers on the internet that they should look at your competition around the corner."}< /resp>

Great food and great atmosphere. Coffee is fantastic. Restaurant has a very nice farm-to-table feeling to it.
Owner has apparently collected China for years which adds a nice detail to experience of dining here since most of the plateware is different types of china.
Definately try the Dutch baby! Worth the wait!
Only warning is that this place has a long wait on the weekends. As long as you come prepared for that you'll have a great time.< /review>

Cozy brunch spot serving high-quality, gourmet dishes with a French flair. Try the custardy Dutch baby pancakes, mushroom tartine, and almond cake. Incredible!<//Review>

Staff was great. Food was excellent. I had the Dutch and it was amazing. Such a great mix of greens and poached eggs on top was perfect. Added house made sausages and it hit the spot. My wife had the Chevre and it was great too. Definitely recommend this spot if you are visitng the area.</review>

<text>Amazing restaurant and market right on PCH. The staff was incredibly nice, the food was organic and delicious with a variety of options for everyone who was in our party. The desserts were amazing as well, especially the chocolate panacotta and the tiramisu. The cashew milk honey steamer was quite tasty. Definitely worth multiple visits. To top it off, the head chef came out to see how our meal was and she was an absolute delight to chat with. 5 stars hands down!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Rate>4< /Rate><time>1559228998211</time><Text>Wanted to try something new instead of my Laguna Beach go-to's and heard a lot about Maison. Cute atmosphere, friendly staff and good standard food - toasts, Dutch baby, quinoa bowls and some to-go items in their fridge case.

Im giving three stars only because I wasn't wowed and felt the menu could be a bit more exciting with a daily special, flavored coffees or some more interesting pastries in the case.  I also don't like the enclosed feeling with the windows being completed frosted. I know it looks out to a parking lot but I felt a bit claustrophobic, is that just me?

I did LOVE the Dutch baby though. It was perfect with that marscapone cream and berries. Also free coffee refills after I downed my latte was the ultimate plus.< /Text>< Response>

What a Fabulous addition to the area! This place is definitely a " Cut Above "many places in the area. Plan to wait a bit however, as it can get crowded, but worth the wait. Wish they had a Rooftop area where one cld enjoy a glass of Wine while waiting!<//Text>

Maybe you ate something prior to coming in that left a lime flavor lingering? Morning margaritas do that to me too sometimes.\n\nHave you ever gone to the market and shopped solely in the organic section? If you have then you know the cost difference... that along with our carefully put together menu add up to a very reasonably priced breakfast lunch or dinner.\n\nHave a great Friday!"}<//Resp>

Enjoyed a very delicious and tasty dinner. Covid precautions still being adhered to and dine in was available. Staff was super nice, friendly and attentive. Food came out rather quickly and was hot. Lots of good choices on the menu which made it hard to decide. Lasagna was uber good and everyone else enjoyed their dinners. I recommend Viney's if you are hungry and in Sonora.<//review>

<review>Place was clean and the service was fast and friendly. I had the meat baked ziti and it was OK. Not a bad place to eat for what it is. I had something a little more in mind so I give it a four. Tiramisu was pretty good.< /review>< GmapID>

I was really excited about their Greek pizza and curry chicken pizza. It was a bit disappointing. The sauces for both didn't really pop. Greek was pesto. The ingredients didn't really pop either for me. I honestly preferred their cheese pizza more because the red sauce was actually pretty good. I would suggest trying their red sauce pizzas</Text>

My first time eating Vineys, I ordered through DoorDash, my food came hot and it arrived quickly thanks for that DoorDash.
However, my mom ordered the TURKEY panini and the meat smells and looks nothing like turkey i don’t even know what kind of meat it is 🤢
I ordered baked ziti, it was ok. But the real issue is with these tiny little pieces of cakes that cost $7 each! I will never order from vineys again.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Terrible service with DoorDash. They gave me boiling hot tomato sauce in thin plastic container and thin paper bag. Once I arrived to customer I took the bag out the lid was not on and it spilt all over the car and onto myself and burned my skin. When I called this restaurant to try to get another order or something, they claimed it was my fault as a doordasher then hung up. When I called back THEY THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE. I was completely calm when talking to them, but my voice was shaken because of the burning mess all over my lap.
Never again 👎 😡😷<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1619216515956, 'text': 'So sad to see that you are miss leadung the public.

What's not to love about Vineys. The food and service is great. I was on vacation and stopped in and was happy to find this little place. Our waitress was Brianna. She was so sweet and such a great waitress, very prompt and helpful. we had the Saffron Salmon Picata. WOW. Delicious fresh and tasty. We will be back.<//text>

Check your items before you leave. The cook burnt our pizza and knowingly still sent it out.  When we called the cook said quite loudly in the background it was only half. They offered a discount for the next time. But the fact that you knowing did that was disappointing. You have to turn pizzas in the oven to avoid burning them. Please choose quality, your customers deserve that, and I believe had we eaten in the restaurant it would have been approached differently.</Review>

I was part of a large dinner group and meals were preordered before hand. Food was fine. I felt Viney's is more of a pizza kitchen than a restaurant as compared to other Italian restaurants. Staff did a good job serving the large party. I'm not familiar with what other options are available in Sonora.  Probably a place I'd recommend for having a pizza and beer vs an Italian dish with fine wine. Atmosphere was more pizza parlor than restaurant.<//review>

My husband swopped his pizza with me as luckily he smokes 6 cigars a day and has lost most of his taste buds. There was only one other couple in so I can’t put down the food to being overwhelmed or super busy, I won’t recommend it.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>WOW! I just found out about this restaurant today!  My friend had told me about Vinny's so we met for lunch and I can say: the Pizza was awesome,  the wine very nice and the service is 5 star +.  I highly recommend Vinny's! They have Lasagna and other Italian dishes and everything looks incredible!  They have an area to seat a group. They MAKE their own Pizza Crust...no preservatives...you can taste the difference.  I can't wait to take my Husband to Vinny's for bite!  It would be a great for date night!  YES! I reccomend Vinny's ❣< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I love Vineys, not just because the food is good but one of the waitresses is so nice! She makes me feel so welcome every time I'm there, as well as being good at her job and timely with orders. 10/10 best service from her, stop by and say Hi and make sure you give that girl a good tip. Her name is Lizzi 😄< /Review>

<Review>This place has a good variety of dishes. There are many options for vegetarian diners and also some gluten-free choices!

I ordered a build your own pasta with penne and a garlic pesto sauce. It was pretty good, but I'll request more sauce next time. It reminded me of Olive Garden a bit. I went late in the evening and have a feeling that earlier would have been better/fresher. The breadstick that came with my meal didn't do anything for me, but maybe I'm just picky. It was a bit dry.

The prices seem a little high, but not unreasonable. I expected a larger portion or higher quality for the 14.95 price. There are refills given on the fountain drinks (which include non-sodas like the delightful pink lemonade I had).

Overall not bad, and it's nice to have an Italian place nearby. I do plan on going again earlier in the day and trying the pizza or calzone.<//Review><gmapID>0x8090c5dea0525901:0x6e19570559c810bd< /gmapID>< Rate>

Waited for 45 minutes for a half burned stuffed pizza. No apology, no drinks comped for our time. I wish I had taken a photo. Will not be returning.< /Review>

This place has so much potential but falls short of it. It’s good for beers after work with co-workers but don’t go for the food.

They don’t have a full built out kitchen and I think they only has a Foreman grill and fry daddy in the back. They have Brats burgers and tots so it’s pretty basic for the most part. It kinda reminded me of what you would make in college where it’s decent but not decadent. Given the area, there’s better options.</Text>

This place hosts meetups sometimes and it can get really crowded. The ambience and location is really good though! They got nice local brews on tap and have a wide variety of cans as well. The bartender does have some great recommendations! Really enjoyed it here. Last call is at 9:15 pm on weekdays.<//review>< Pics>

I went there with my team for happy hour after work recently. They only serve beer & wine with no plans of adding alcohol. They also offer pizzas. We had the margharita and the veggie ones, which were good. I like the margharita best. The pizza are thin crust and have a good taste, especially right when they come out of the oven. The employees, who I think own the place, were very nice and attentive. The prices seem on par with other wine bars in the area. I would go back bc it's close to my work.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Swing by here on a hunch to verify some information. After confirming business has exchange hand from G Spot to 3rd Street Tap Room, it's up to introduced myself. This place is still working out the kinks, but from what I've learned, this may eventually turn out as another alternative for after work HH hangout spot. The people running operation are also the same family that runs Internos Wine Bar. As soon as I walked in, the people were friendly and inviting never once rush me to order. There's a couple of televisions and different seating area depending on size of your party. Beer menu automatically changes daily depending on how popular it is. Local and out of state beer are available. What you got today may not be the same tomorrow. Food is served daily from 4-11pm mostly snacks to finger food to main entree of pizza. Great people and good atmosphere with food coming soon makes this the ideal place for me to tucked in and catch up on some work. Btw, WFB ATM is within steps of tap room. You'll never run out of cash for drinks hahaha..<//review><Resp>None< /Resp>< rating>

<text>We were blown away at the professionalism and extremely kind and over the top service we received from Bailey Boys. Our windows were so filthy and they took extra time to make sure that they were clean and spotless. When they were completed the price was even lower than they originally quoted us which made for an even better result. We would definitely recommend this company to everyone we know!<//text>< user_id>

<Time>1622771993513<//Time><review>After getting a referral from my next door neighbor, who gave a glowing recommendation, I decided to use them to wash the windows (inside and out), clean the screens and clean the window tracks.  When I called I encountered a very professional organization.  I was given a clear and complete explanation of what the service would likely cost, what services they could provide and when they would be able to do the job.  The crew showed up on time and got immediately to work.  They normally send a crew of two to do a job my size, but I was fortunate that they sent five people (Jake, Tony, Sam, Scott and Billy).  I was very impressed with their work ethic.  They kept their heads down and worked quickly and thoroughly.  They were polite and businesslike.  The job was done to perfection.  I will definitely be using them again.</review>< user_name>

I really appreciate that they were on time, did a wonderful job and liked the attention to detail and clean up especially from the gutters. Thanks too for taking a few minutes to meet and greet with my dog so he wouldn’t be so anxious about hearing and seeing people working outside. Thank you, thank you. Everything looks great!</Review>

They showed up right on time and did an excellent, thorough job. They lifted furniture to get underneath and didn’t cut corners. Great value for the price!<//review>

<text>I am extremely pleased with the results of the various services, especially the window washing. This is the 3rd time my windows have been washed (1st time by Bailey Boy) and the sparkles without any evidence of streaks or smears. They were industrious, professional and pleasant to work with.<//text>< username>

I have used them for 2-3 years. Patrick and Tony showed up on time and ready to work. They cleaned the gutters and  flushed the downspouts with water to make sure the entire system is cleaned and ready to go.

Rhonda in the office is always professional and accommodating

Do your self a favor and call Bailey Boys!</text>

I am very pleased with their services. I would highly recommend this company. I have been using their services for over 10 years now. I started with them, when it was just Brad & Scott Bailey (The Bailey Boys) years ago. Now they are even bigger and better.

They are very reliable, great workers, they complete their jobs in a timely manner, very professional and their prices are very reasonable too. I like that they offer so many different services, makes it convenient. Doesn’t get much better than this. :)< /text>

My windows and gutters were cleaned by Bailey Boys. The two young men that did the work were great.  They did a fantastic job.  They were professional, polite and personable and definitely knew their job well.  This is my second time using them and I will definitely be using them a few times a year to clean my windows and once a year to clean my gutters.</Text>

Great service.  Professional interaction and performance.  My windows interior and exterior with all screens cleaned as well as window tracks. I also had my blinds cleaned to perfection.  I really like the clear view from my window.  Very clean.   Great staff.  I already provided other neighbors with their business number.  Well done...< /review>

<text>This is our second time using Bailey Boys for windows and the first for pressure washing. The Boys are good - very professional and they do good work! The owner (Scott) stopped by 2 days prior to look over the work to be done and to provide an accurate quote. Now that’s good customer service! Thanks again BB!</text>< pictures>

The representative on the phone, who was very polite and professional, was able to quickly set up a morning appointment within two days of my call.  The price quoted for both services were very reasonable.  The morning of my appointment two young men showed up right on time and again were very polite and professional.  They explained exactly what and how they would be performing the services and asked if I had any questions and then got to work.  After they had completed the two services they showed me pictures of the cleaned solar panels which were amazingly clean and looked like new.  They noted that several downspouts had been completely clogged and now were free and clear.  They cleaned up after themselves and I was very pleased with both services.</Text>< rate>

I would highly recommend Bailey Boys for your pressure washing needs. This company immediately responded to my inquiry, offered me a reasonable estimate for the work I needed done and scheduled my appointment right away. On the day of the job, Steve and Cameron showed up ahead of time which was very much appreciated.
Steve and Cameron were absolutely fantastic. They were thorough, made sure we were all in the same page in terms of the work that was to be completed and were very personable and professional. As an added bonus they asked if I would like my driveway cleaned as well .....at no additional cost.  Bailey Boys Services definitely deserve a 5 Star rating.< /review>

< Review>
Recently bought a home where the owner previously smoked and had cats. I have terrible allergies so we really needed it steamed as our shampoo job wasn't enough. Their crew came on time and promptly took care of our needs. They even went above and beyond with moving some of our furniture. They left us some booties so we could still take care of things as the floor dried. I am thankful and they have now gained a life long Customer.  Quality of service is key and hard to find.< /Review>

Without a doubt, please call this company if you're looking for their services!  From the time of my initial request, I had Cody and Quinn out to my house within 1 day.  Not only did they do an exceptional job, but they were courteous, respectful, and more importantly, flexible with an added service of pressure washing (original request was window washing).  Super great experience and I will use them again in the future!<//review>

Pat and Connor did an excellent job shampooing my carpet, cleaning my tile and washing my windows. They did all three in one trip. Their boss, Scott Bailey, stoped by during their work to make sure everything was going smoothly.  They are gentlemen and professionals. I would recommend them highly to anyone.<//review>

They got me on the schedule fairly quickly considering that I called after it started raining. They cleaned the gutters on our 2 story and we didn’t even have to be home for it. They arrived on time and got it done quickly. I’ll definitely be using them again. Especially since I found out how affordable they are! Great people and great quality of work<//Review>

They did a great job.  Pressure washed my brick backyard, cleaned windows interior and exterior,  cleaned my travertine kitchen tile, bathrooms tile, 2 carpets, a couch and chair, 2 area rugs.  Everything looks like new and they didn't leave behind any mess.   Highly recommend their services.< /review>

<Review>Second time with Bailey Boys and I definitely will be using them again in the future.  Scotty and Brandon were extremely polite, efficient and got the job done quickly.  I was having a particularly troublesome issue with one downspout - they went the extra mile to make sure the issue was resolved before they left.  I appreciate the attention to quality work, and the price is extremely fair.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
We are Bozzuto and Company Insurance Services located in Orangevale, CA and have been using Bailey Boys for many years now. Every year we have our windows and blinds cleaned by this amazing company. We have 50+ windows in our building and upwards of 100 blinds. This year we received exceptional service from Quinn and Scotty!! Both men were quick and meticulous when working and left us with an amazing end result. Both of these young men will create life long customers for this company. Please let them know what an amazing job they did! We will defiantly be asking for Quinn and Scotty in the future.< /Review>

We recently moved into a two-story house with many windows, and they got dirty fast. I was very pleased when the Bailey Boys were able to schedule our cleaning so quickly! Their team arrived during the scheduled time and were extremely professional. Our windows now sparkle like new and make the entire house seem cleaner! I will absolutely use their services again!!<//Review>

I came across Bailey Boys Services through yelp saw all the great reviews so I decided to reach out. I had Ronda the manager assist me, she answered my questions & assured me her team could get the job done with my concerns I mentioned to her. I scheduled an appt with her and within 2 days I had one of the crew members come out to my home.

I had Adam come out to clean my gutters showed up a bit earlier which I appreciated, was very friendly & knowledgeable. I let him know the concerns I previously had mentioned to Ronda with my gutters & he assured me he could get the job done with no problem. He got to work took his time to clean them throughly but quickly as well. He was wonderful!

Thank you Bailey Boys Services for your exceptional service!! Definitely will be a returning customer!</Review>

The Bailey Boys window cleaning service was amazing! We have around 30 windows, we had 3 Bailey Boys men arrive and 2 hours later we have sparkling clean windows inside and out, clean screens and tracks! They were very respectful to our house and our 3 children. Took their shoes off when inside, even took off their hats (our youngest asked why he took his hat off and I explained that was a sign of respect inside a house)!! We were very impressed with their service and will absolutely use them again!!< /text>

They do an amazing job on windows!! I’ve had them to my house multiple times and have taken them to my moms house also! They are clean, thorough and really nice guys. I highly recommend them to everyone. Excellent prices, and they keep you in the system so it’s simple to make appointments because the price and size of job are already set. Great customer service, love Bailey Boys Services!< /Review>

<Text>Bailey Boys are Punctual and Professional.  Adam greeted us with a smile and handshake.  Had them Clean off our roof, gutters & downspouts.  Also they cleaned all our window glass inside and out  and the window screens too.  Windows and screens look amazing.  If you want it done right the first time, call the Bailey Boys!  We highly recommend their services.  Thanks Brad for your great service.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>My real name is Rex Ireland, not Jethro Sledge.  I want to make that clear so there's no question about the validity of my review.

Prompt and efficient.  I was pleased to receive a referral for Bailey Boys Services from a roofing contractor who performed a roof inspection for me.  I wasted no time in contacting Bailey Boys Services, and was very pleased with the response time for my initial inquiry, and the scheduling of my gutter cleaning service.  The guys showed up on time on a Monday morning.  They completed the job, cleaned up, and were on there way again.  I received my invoice by email, then was able to pay it online with little more than the click of a button.

I give Bailey Boys Services 6 stars out of 5 for integrity and ease of doing business.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Bailey Boys checked off all the good boxes! Here ontime, went right to work and wanted to make sure everything was done to my satisfaction.
Thanks for the service!

Our 18-year old windows have never been professionally cleaned. So you can imagine how dirty and how much build up there was. I was afraid they would have to spend the whole day at our house to clean our many, many windows in our 2-story home. But they did it! In about 3.5 hours. Our windows look brand new. The crew came on time, were professionals and did excellent work. Their price was the best amongst competitors. Highly recommend!!</Text>

They arrived on time and got busy.  I really appreciate it that they tell me about the condition of my screens and windows.  That's especially nice since I have a two story home.  They always go the extra mile for me.  Bailey boys are the best!< /Review>

I have had a great experience using Bailey boys to clean out my gutters and do the window cleaning. I have used them 2 years in a row. Both times the guys showed up on time and got the job done in a timely manner. They were very clean and even took their shoes off before coming inside to do the interior windows. I recommend them to any homeowner!!<//Review>

Showed up early, very efficient, highly professional team.  Most importantly, they did a fantastic job cleaning the windows on my two story house and even showed me a window who's seal had broken, trapping moisture between the panes so I can get it replaced.  Much appreciated - will definitely use again.</Review>

<Review>Bailey Boys washed our windows and cleaned the blinds in our rental home we are living in at the moment.  They did a beautiful and professional job.  I'm sure there was years of yuck on the blinds from other renters.  We were very pleased with the job when they were done.  It was service with a smile!<//Review>< pics>

<text>I never knew my stucco had sparkles in it until after Bailey Bros visit. Friendly service, flexible pricing, beautiful and thorough work. What more could you want? There was a miscommunication on my bill that was quickly rectified by a very friendly person. I waiting the whole 9 years I was in this house to do this because I thought it would be so expensive! Don’t wait! Make your house sparkle!</text>< pics>

I have been using the Bailey Boys window cleaning service for about 2 years. I wouldn't have any other company. The young men who do the cleaning are professional, courteous, and excellent at what they do. I have recommended them to family and would invite you to give them a try. Never a problem, never a disappointment. Always pleased at the end result and experience.<//Review>

<text>They are reliable, fast and do a great job! They're rates are good and they are an honest company. We were qouted a higher rate beforehand and upon the job completion they let us know it wasn't as bad as they had anticipated and charged us less. How many companies can you say that about? It's nice to find such someone we can depend on. Not only will we continue to utilize their services, but we will be recommending them to all our neighbors and friends.</text><username>Sarah Clementi</username><Time>1540477991194<//Time><response>{'time': 1540479669092, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Sarah.

Return customer for good reason...scheduling ease; quality service and  thorough job cleaning windows (2 story), and aging carpeting (with stairs). The service crew of two arrived on-time ready for work. They were careful, asked about any special conditions needing attention, and moved in and out of the condo quietly. Job done in less than 2 hours. Well worth the reasonable price.</Text>

What a wonderful team Steve and Keith were this past Thursday (06/21/18) when they cleaned  our windows.  Our home is a two level home with windows not easily accessible.  They were on time, polite, professional, and did a great job cleaning our windows, sills, tracks and screens.  They were neat and tidy, no evidence of their work was left behind.  We highly recommend this company, they are awesome.</Text>

The service was excellent and the price was surprisingly competitive. They went above and beyond when I couldn't complete some of the pre-work I needed to get done for them and didn't complain or make an issue. They even did some extra work I needed done that isn't part of their normal service suite. Can't recommend them highly enough.< /text>

They were on time. Very professional and encountered a unique aspect to my screens but were able to work around it and get the job done. Great communication and customer service.< /Review>

I have a single floor plan w/lots of windows. A very personable young man named Cody came to do my windows on the day after Christmas and did a fantastic job. He got straight to work and was a joy to have in my home.  Would be happy to use their services again.</Review>

Bailey Boys have been cleaning the gutters on my high water bungalow in midtown for three years now.  The gutters are three stories above street level and, because of the wonderful trees in midtown, get a lot of debris. A couple of other companies turned me down because of the challenges. Bailey Boys crews are quick and thorough, and the service is easy to schedule and reasonably priced.<//text>

This is the second time I have used Bailey Boys Services for window washing and again they did an excellent job.  My windows were beautifully cleaned.  Rob and Daniel were the service team, they were courteous and respectful.  It's very refreshing to see young adults act professionally.  I highly recommend Bailey Boys Services and will continue to use them on both of my homes.<//text>

So glad I called and scheduled with Bailey Boys Services. This was my first time using their company to have all the windows cleaned on our two story. They arrived on time, worked efficiently, and were so friendly and polite while working that my toddler wanted them to stay for a tea party. Our windows look amazing and I could not be more pleased. I will be contacting them the next time our windows need to be cleaned and for our solar panels. Thank you again Bailey Boys.< /Text>

Yay! Clean windows! Rhonda is exceptionally patient and friendly with scheduling and explaining the service. Cameron and Mason did a great job, but equally important to me is that they were polite, professional and careful in my home. Cameron even gave me some feedback about the potential for leaks around my windows (and it was good news). I will  definitely use Bailey Boys again for any service needs I have and I am confident in referring them to you, too.< /Text>

I can confirm after looking at the trucks GPS data the guys were only at your home for 30 minutes. We should have definitely only charged you our minimum charge of $150. I have spoken with both technicians and given them better instruction for the future. I have corrected your pricing in our database so you will only be charged $150 in the future and have noted your account with a $50 dollar credit you can use towards any future services with us if you choose to give us another shot. Again, thank you for the feedback, it helps us make necessary corrections where needed.\nSincerely, Brad Bailey'}</Resp>

They are a good company. However I was quoted $235 for a full gutter cleaning.  And that was ok.  But the two employees that were on my roof were only up there for approximately 15-20 minutes.  They were great and have no complaints with them.  They said they could lower it to $200.  I had previously used them a few years in the past and it was very similar (15-20 minutes of wok) and they charged $100. I asked if they could come lose to that. They lowered it to $175.  I left the was slightly high for being there for such a short period of time .I know things are expensive, however, that is about $350 per hour for each employee.  The office manager was not the most friendly.  While the employees that have been to out house, have always been gtrst, I think I'll be trying somewhere different in the future .< /text>

Bailey Boys Services are PERFECT!  I have had many other window cleaning services in the past and have been very disappointed.  The Bailey boys are clean cut, friendly. courteous and hard working professionals that do a great job of cleaning windows and screens in a timely fashion.  I highly recommend this company to anyone who wants clean affordable window service!

I had my gutters cleaned by two staff members from Baileyboys who arrived earlier than expected and were very polite and presentable. Asked me if I had any problematic areas of my gutters and proceeded to clean out the gutters (2-story). They worked fast and when completed let me know that all areas of my gutters were cleaned. I will recommend them to anyone needing their gutters cleaned. Thanks again Baileyboys!</review>

<Text>Ryan and Daniel were great!  They went beyond my expectations and even provided some valuable advice. Gutters and downspouts were cleaned and inspected. One gutter seam needed a little sealant and one downspout needed some widget to help prevent leaves from building a dam and clogging the flow of water.  Will highly refer them out to my clients, family and friends. Thank you taking some stress off me before the winter storms come in!<//Text>< user_name>

I have used Bailey Boys to clean the windows in my West Sacramento condo on several occasions. They are prompt, courteous, and do a great job! If you have a concern, Ronda will be right back with you to address it.</review>

<review>We have been having our windows washed and the house pressure washed by Bailey Boys for several years.  They always do a fabulous job, they are reliable, and just the nicest guys to have around, very professional and friendly.  They also do carpet cleaning, gutter cleaning, solar panel cleaning and holiday lighting.  We have used them to do the lights on our giant Blue Spruce tree and will have them back this December to get us ready for Christmas.</review>< userid>
