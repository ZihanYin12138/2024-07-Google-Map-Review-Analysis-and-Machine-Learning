My 79 year old Mother went to her first Kaiser appointment on 1/19.21. She was told to wait outside for more than four hours in total before she was seen!!! She waiting outside in a TENT!! There was no heating lamps or adequate privacy!! I am highly upset and saddened at this procedure!! I understand that this is for Covid -19 protection but, there IS a better way people!!!  Get a number system and have the Patients wait in their cars until they are able to be seen.  My Mother has allergy issues and the wind was very high yesterday. Needless to say  that her allergies were exacerbated by all this!! Get this together ASAP!!! I will also contact corporate about this procedure!!! This is appalling!!! No stars for the interim waiting arrangements!  However, The Staff was pleasant per My Mothers comments!!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

It seems like the incentives for my current primary physician is money. She is extremely impatient. I don’t feel like I am seen by a doctor. They treat you like you are at In-n-out.</review>

I visited the urgent care multiple times never receiving a diagnosis or feeling better when I leave. They always prescribe pain medication and never run any test. I’m not a doctor but don’t you have to at least run a small test other then checking my vitals. Like a blood test or a urine test. I have been having severe pain in my back for over 9 months ever since I revived bruised ribs by a fall. And when I call to let them know that I still have this pain and I can’t live they prescribe icy hot I’m honestly so fed up with doctors in this place I really want to know what medical school they went to because I feel like they just search up my symptoms on google and come back and give me a subpar diagnosis.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

There was quick service, entertainment for children in the waiting rooms, and clean spaces where one can be seated. The doctors also do their best to treat all patients with quality care that is efficient.</Text>

1st time using Kaiser, today was my 1st visit to the UC, I had a very good experience, everyday could be different, but I am glad my 1st experience went well, my visit lasted about 2 hours from check in to getting out of the Pharmacy. It was very busy but I think the staff and Providers were up to speed, same in bvb the pharmacy. 👏
The only negative would have been one of the front/lobby ladies doing the check-in.  Not welcoming at all, didn't care to interact with the person she was checking in, but I'm not gonna let that mess up the rest of my experience 🤷‍♀️ Maybe she was just not feeling well today ... Thank You<//text>

They do not respect appointment times, if you get to your appointment late they  do not take you in for it. However, If you arrive on time and wait to get called in, they will still call you in late after your set appointment time or just completely forget about you. Worst Kaiser Permanente facility. Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!</review>

This place is great if you are there in person but if you need any help or info over the phone or away from this location you are never going to get help or what you need. I have gone Kaiser since i was born and to this location since it opened, but I moved to Utah and needed my vaccination records. I called them to get that but they keep transferring me to a recording that does nothing. I have called several times on different days and at different times during operating hours. I try to get transferred to a person and it pretends to do so, but always says they are unavailable to take your call but if you leave a message they say they will get back in 24hours. My fist message was left 3-4 weeks ago and still no call. They have now changed the recording and only gives you the option to leave a recording if you sent in your form that you need them to fill out and gives no guarantee they will return your call in 24 hours. (for school, government, or employer) however I don't need anything filled out I just need my records. I don't understand why this is so hard and I am about to drive all the way to Cali from Utah just to get this info. All in all they have been good to me since I have been going there but now that I am gone I feel like yesterdays garbage so I gave them a rating that matched. realistically I would say this experience has dropped them to a three star, but since even after all of our good experience together they dropped me to a one star I did the same for them. It will also stay that way if I have to drive to California to get this resolved.<//review>

I've had Kaiser for year's. And I've always paid $15.00 dollar's for my co-pay. Today I come in and I'm charged $60.00 dollar's. If they we're going to change something shouldn't I have been told??? It sucks so bad I'm going to have to cancel my membership. I can't afford 60 dollar's every time I'm seen. And X-Rays I now have to pay 30%. I'm so disappointed. I never had these problems in Fontana, Riverside or Los Angeles. Only Lancaster!!! 😔😔😔</Text>

Urgent care is a joke.  It took 4 hours for my son to be sent to Renaissance Imaging for an ultrasound.  The ultrasound was so badly done that his urgent care doctor couldn't see what was wrong.  She just sent him home with Percocet, not caring what was causing his incredible pain.  His doctor at Kaiser Hollywood made him get an ultrasound in the ER down there and they immediately realized that he had a massive hernia that required immediate surgery.  His Lancaster urgent care doctor should have her license revoked!!!!  I will never go there again!!!<//Text>

<Text>Brought my sister in law on for high blood pressure,  front desk needs to be educated on what is urgent. High BP is very critical. We get checked in and.told to sit and wait. I only waited 10 mins and approached front desk again telling her my sister has history of uncontrollable bp.
Then 5 min later finally get to triage.
In triage bp was 196/104...yes I was right. So she puts us straight in room. Then we get forgotten about dor another 15 mins, no nurse or anyone comes in. So i go to nurses station where 4 nurses are sitting there very comfortably.
I ask of anyone is assigned to room 18 they respond " there are 3 people ahead of you, you have to wait for doctor"
I replied:" wow this is how you treat high blood pressure?"</Text>< pictures>

Okay I had to change my review. I was lucky on my sons first visit. However, since moving here I had to go to urgent care twice. The first time the lobby was full of people and I waited close to 4 hours while everyone in the back was talking about some dog that died in someone’s laundry room Wth!  The second time I thought “ wow ok 5 people in urgent care,“ days before Christmas. Nope wait time was longer than 4 close to 5 hours!!!! I don’t like that everyone can hear what your visit is about. Curtains don’t help with patient confidentiality!

For quite awhile I thought this was a pretty good facility and it is for your basic needs. However if you need to visit urgent care be prepared to wait hours and hours.  Why can’t they spend a little money and speed up the process.</review>

Since you register , you see how unprofessional there is, I can not say all, but 70% yes it is.
I think they should focus on educating their staff and especially hiring people who do not treat badly and less discriminate because of their race or color.
Many times that out of fear, they do not say their bad experiences here, but I think that one must say it, since this is a country free of expression. true?<//review>< user_id>

I've been with Kaiser a long time and I'm questioning my membership here. I have a simple issue and instead of giving me a simple solution they have given me the run around.

I've never been disappointed going to this location.  The staff is always friendly, and they work hard to keep things moving quickly with patients.  The Urgent Care area has a couple vending machines as well, so you can get a snack or drink if the wait is long.  I've also never had to wait more than 15 minutes for my prescriptions after a doctor visit.  For a family that has some minor, but on going medical issues, this Kaiser location has been handy to have.< /Text>

<Review>There always seems to be a long wait with urgent care but you can usually get a same day appt in family medical. I had a great experience in the OB dept. I was monitored regularly with my high risk pregnancy. The pediatrics dept is great. They do phone appointments  and discourage urgent care for my infant. They are always able to get us in to pediatrics for an appointment. My husband had major back surgery and had a fantastic neurosurgeon. There are lots of services available in Lancaster. Kaiser makes life so much easier. I tried to deal with Blue Cross HMO for a year...what a nightmare.</Review>< Pictures>

Wasn't happy about my first visit here. Treated poorly. For me paying a good amount and have to go thru this coming in receptionist was rude he didn't even give me a name bracelet with my name on it to show to the tec that was about to take my blood. Walking into the building no direction on where to go. Wasn't given a Med drink to drink before giving blood felt like I was on medical or something and I pay a good amount not to mention have to pass about 3 Kaiser places before even getting to this one that looks bad. 20 mins out of my way while pregnant.<//text>

I give one star because you cant leave a review without one.  I just changed to Kaiser this year AND OH MY GOD!!! ITS HORIBLE!! ALL doctors are dismissive rude and there just for the paycheck. I have had pain I have MRI's xrays to prove my reasons for pain. But pain is not a symptom because everyone has it. The physician assistant that I saw today told me this and just dismissed me. He and all the doctors I've seen since signing to Kaiser act's and says the same thing. " I dont feel comfortable prescribing medication" or "im not the doctor to ask for pain medication" (and that's pain management). No tests no nothing to investigate my claim. No relief in sight.
OH, THE FACILITY IS CLEAN, at least the staff that cleans the facility cares about doing a good job! KUDDOS TO THEM!!!<//review>

I really love the offices in Lancaster. It is wheel chair accessible in every building and office we have been too. There is plenty of parking and thank goodness there are wheelchairs provided. Otherwise I would have to carry my family members wheelchair in and out of my car and they are heavy! Just be sure to check your co pay right prior to going because I was just notified today it went up with no reason behind it. That's frustrating! They do follow up and have treated my family member with respect and dignity though.  Very clean  facilities!</text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Just got lied to by Urgent Care. Went with my sick child. Person right in front of me was told 3 people ahead of him and the wait would be about 30 minutes. I go up, the lady notices I made an appointment for later on in the day, and I told her I was just trying to see if I could get in quicker. She laughed at me and then told me there's 6 people ahead and the wait would be 2 hours. There was no one else checking people in.. how could this happen?  Lied right to my face. No regard for the patients.< /review>< Pictures>

<Date>1548268071563< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>Dr. Cybulski is extremely dismissive, lacks professionalism, has zero follow-through and horrible bedside manner.

He has been my father’s physician for years and knows nothing about him. Obviously he’s more concerned with saving Kaiser money rather than taking care of patients.

Dr. Cybulski has refused to order routine tests and even scoffed audibly during an appointment when concerns about my dad’s deteriorating health were expressed.

Additionally, when I requested diagnostic blood work, he opted to prescribe blood pressure medicine for my dad without any discussion. Meanwhile, completely ignoring my concerns and requests.

Totally useless! Avoid this Dr.<//text>< pictures>

While out of town with the family in North San Diego County I got the flu followed by my wife and daughter the next day.  I went to a Kaiser Permanente Urgent Care in Murrieta on Friday.  I was seen by a doctor after a short wait he said yes looks like same flu going around and prescribed Tamiflu.  Sunday morning wife and daughter went to Kaiser Urgent Care in San Marcos.  Also  treated very nicely and also given Tamiflu to speed recovery and reduce severity of symptoms.  Got home to Antelope Valley on Monday and now my son is starting with same fever and nasty cough.  Take him to Lancaster Kaiser urgent care.  Wow what a difference,  told us yep he's got the flu and just go home and treat with OTC meds.  Also said we should have just stayed home and not brought him in to "contaminate" the facility.  I guess they only let you in when you're perfectly healthy.  After experiencing what good service is like the terrible service at the Lancaster Kaiser Permanente site was very disappointing.   Questioning our switching to Kaiser Permanente now .< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c25aff1d8154f7:0x14cfd03ed52419d4</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'm very dissapointed at Kaiser I had bad experiences with previous doctors and specialist. I felt like they didn't and don't care about my health. I'm not a doctor so i dont know what test to asked for myself. Until now i dont know what's causing this pain I have or what can I do about it . They had send me to therapy and the person that was supposed to help me shut me down! Buy telling me i can go see another facility. Which i think is inappropriate becuase i went to ease my pain to see if it helps.  I feel like they only care about collecting and that is it.  And they lack by providing more information things that you can do before taking medication or things you can do to help yourself.<//review>

This is by far the worst Kaiser Pharmacy I have experienced. I was getting my sons medication here for his epholepsy for over a year. Then out of the blue the pharmacist, not the doctor or the pharmacy, but the lead pharmacist decided to change the manufacturer supplier for his Depakote. The one thing all 4 of my son's doctors have told me is to never change suppliers of a generic medication. The reason is the medication makeup is by law, allowed to change by 10% from generic to name brand. So from generic to generic you could possibly see a 20% difference in dosage. With seizure medications this big of a change could actually bring on a seizure. I don't take chances with my son's health. I did everything the head pharmacist asked including having his Dr. spacificaly wright the script for the brand name medication.  He was prescribed this brand and it has been working flowlessley sense his second seizure.  I made no less than 8 visits to this pharmacy and had my son's Dr make 4 attempts to satisfy the lead Pharmacist demands. No luck. After two months of them giving partial fills until one of us caved in, my sons frustrated Dr. called her pharmacist in the Panorama City Kaiser.  All my fears of THIS lancaster pharmacy and the lead pharmacist were verified. Both the Panorama City and Palmdale Kaiser pharmacies said the same. They have both correctly filled his scripts with zero trouble and both have confirmed the notes that show that the Lancaster pharmacy has taken it upon them selves to change his supplier. With no regard for the patient and the patients health. The big difference is cost. To save a buck he would put my son at risk. The pharmacist tried to hide behind Kaiser saying it was Kaiser that decided to change the supplier. However, both the other pharmacies I visit now, say that's simply just not true.
Please don't put yourself or your loved ones health in the hands of these criminals at the Lancaster Pharmacy. There only goal is to save this location money at the end of the year and not to provide a service of good health that we are all making a monthly payment for (my guess is for a bonus or to hang a plack on the wall)  We do our part. It's illegal not to. Why is it allowable for pharmacies to lie and manipulate and even worse, put people's lives in danger.  People trust Dr's and rely on pharmacies to follow that same line of trust. When they don't, we are lost and not understanding whats happened and hardly ever think that the people we trusted are the ones to blame.<//Text>

This place is the worst!! Im worse off now then I was before going here. The Drs couldnt diagnose anything if it was put right in front of them. I was told by a RN that works in the Kaiser hospital down below, that they send the bad Drs to the AV. I believe it. They have ruined my quality  of life. Havent been the same since Kaiser.  Filed a compliant with MS but havent heatd back. Husband wants to get a lawyer.< /Text>

<Date>1441296927162< /Date><rate>1<//rate><Review>I am scheduled for a surgery and two RN's that gave a presurgery class recommended a couple DME items that would be beneficial to get prior to surgery.  I contacted my surgeon via email to request a prescription be sent to Apria for said DME item.  I received a reply from my surgeon's RN stating that "the hospital case mgr would handle it and the DME item I am requesting is not usually a prescribed item", although it was recommended to me for my surgery. So, I called Member Services in Lancaster, CA to request help and voice my complaint.  They never answer the phone anymore.  So I called the 800 # for Member Services and filed a complaint.  Seems Kaiser is not as willing to help as they are to just push you away.  Very sad.  Wish I could have given zero stars!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>That Jasmine manager is extremely rude. Went in for ice cream and she rolled her eyes and was speaking to me in a condescending way. I honestly feel bad for the employees 😕 if they have to work for that person.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>My favorite place for icecream. I love that you can choose the flavor of icecream and add your own choice of items to mix in. Even if you don't add toppings they still mix your icecream on the cold stone counter so it is nice and smooth! My kids love picking their own flavors and toppings then getting to watch them be mixed together</text>< rating>

It was a Friday night so was to be expected.  So many Cold Stone locations have closed so I'm glad this one is still here.  It's been a couple years since we had their ice cream last.<//Review><GmapID>0x8090f9c115f76b7b:0xa2de45ad57e1b0ac<//GmapID><Resp>None<//Resp><Rate>4</Rate><user_name>John Buzolich<//user_name><Date>1524890137150</Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have been taking my son to this barbershop for the past 7 months with barber Anthony. He does a great job keeping my son entertained and distracted while cutting his hair. He always makes sure the haircut is satisfying for the client and willing to do any last minute touch ups. I love the customer service, music and good energy. This is a welcoming and kid friendly environment. Great barbershop<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My son loves this place he literally won't go anywhere else. I don't know if the PlayStation 4 has something to do with it 🤔but none the less the barbers always treat me and my son friendly and are very welcoming. They also are so informed on the newest hairstyle and trends which make choosing my son's haircut way easier. I give this place 5 stars and recommend this to anyone that needs a great haircut.

P.S. They even shaped my eyebrows for only 5 dollars. They used the straight razor to do so something I had never experienced. It was painless and looked just as good as waxing if not better. This place is great I understand why it's so busy.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Hands down best barbershop experience I've ever had. Been coming here since it opened last year. Have not not been disappointed yet great place skin fades razor line ups and shaves. Recommend this shop to anybody looking for a sharp clean high quality haircut. Also love the fact that this shop is located in a mall with plenty of parking and food places near by. Overall great vibe every time. Barbers are always friendly and professional.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d94de6fcf315ef:0x7134bb04f08806e6<//gmap_id></record>

<text>Found this place and decided to give them a shot. Walked-in without an appointment and got seated right away. I showed my barber, Juan, what I wanted and he took the time to ask me exactly how I wanted it all around. He had a good steady hand and his attention to detail was great. Overall one of the best cuts I've had. I will be back here for sure. Thanks Juan.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rate>

When I say I was skeptical of who was cutting my sons hair, I WAS SKEPTICAL!! Went in after 7pm n Anthony cut his hair but when I say he used so much precision and care??? It was refreshing to see someone with so much talent take time and make sure it was cut right. I DEFINATELY FOUND A NEW BARBER!!!<//review>

<Review>Friendly staff, good vibes and attention to detail make this my new barber spot. After living in San Diego for a little over a year, I had trouble finding the perfect barber for me and I went to A LOT of different barbershops. And was either faced with stuck up/rude employees, or just laziness. And also I appreciated the fact that my barber doesn't leave me in the chair to go smoke a blunt in the middle of my cut ( i.e. Ace of Fades 🙄 and various other places) my first cut was with Leo and every cut after will be too and she is fantastic and very welcoming, how you want your cut is how they provide it. Made it feel very homey and comfortable. So after a year and a half I finally found my barber!.<//Review>< pics>

One of the most well rounded barbershops i've been to compared to all the other shops in San Diego. The barbers are always friendly, respectful, and welcoming, I recommend going to Cris, one of the most consistent barbers there always paying real close attention to details and making sure his work is as crisp and clean as it can be.<//review>

I have been going to these guys for over a year now and never leave with a bad cut. Friendly people who know what they are doing. The shop is always improving everytime I come back. If you don't come by and check them out, then you just don't wanna see what's out there.< /text>

If you're searching for a clean friendly barbershop and an amazing haircut look no more fam... Andres was my barber and he completely improved my hairstyle. he took his time and gave a super clean fade as well as texturized my hair and gave me the look I desired. I will definitely be coming back to this barbershop. A+++< /Text>

Been Getting my haircut at Supreme since it opened up. Never had a bad experience here, every time you walk in you can feel those good vibes coming from the barbers.  Dre always delivers the fresh clean cut for any special occasion, Music on point, entertainment for clients just in case there is a wait, awesome light up sign inside the shop, and looks like a pretty cool mural is being done at the moment too , can't wait to see it when it's fully done. Highly recommend this shop to anyone near the Chula Vista area or anyone in particular, I come all the way from Poway to get my cut here and all I gotta say is "it's worth the long drive"
-ps.  Best thing if you in a rush and don't got cash, they take card. ;)< /Text>

I live here in the downtown chula vista area and work at the chula vista mall so I may be a bit biased on the location but you can get a haircut while your girlfriend or wife goes shopping and you get that real barber service as opposed to other malls you get that salon environment which many o business guys are not comfortable in.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Got my haircut here yesterday and the barber messed up my part really bad. Extremely bad. Most barbers spend 25 minutes cutting my hair, this guy took an hour to do uneven lines and uneven fades. This is NOT worth $35. It's not even worth $10. I didnt get the barber's name but the dude had dreads. Will NEVER go back there!< /text>

Sandro the barber has won several barber competitions around and outside of cali. His professionalism and cutting skills motivate me to commute every weekend from Escondido all the way to Chula Vista for a fresh cut. If you're looking for a clean fresh and sharp haircut this is the spot to go to by far. (The couch is comfortable so it's worth the wait lol.)<//Review>

<Text>I am station in San Diego and I never though I was going  to find an excelent barber like my barber back in New York City, I went to supreme babershop in Chula vista and got a Cut with Sandro, I have to be honest, Sandro is at another level in the barbershop business, he is very profesional and gives his customers a personalized service.  This guy is the best that I ever seen in this business, Thank you so much.....< /Text>< name>

Worst experience,  Dont usually do walking but they had barbers there, they cut my hair clippers literally making me bleed from pressing to hard,clipper burn, and messed up the easiest part of a hair cut (the sides) played not to be rude but never coming back ever again<//Text>

<text>Ridiculously over priced; price point not equal to experience level of the unlicensed barbers within the shop.

Ex: 9 yr old boy fade = $20 plus $5 for a part. C’mon man — be fair. One barber charged $20 for an adult male haircut and mustache trim and charged my son $25. SMH.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rate>

<Text>This Place is a total contradiction. It's not in the best area... When I say be aware of your surroundings I mean it. Shady people outside 24/7. But inside is a different story. Clean, well lit, family friendly, great customer service, food is fresh and RR are available. Not sure if there's parking available (I walked from the hospital to the location). I probably won't be going back soon only because the people outside are too much. 😳< /Text>< pics>

By far the best Yoshinoya I've eaten at, much better than others I've been to (they actually keep their bathroom clean). The employees treat you with respect and maintain a professional attitude. Very clean inside and the best part you get your food quickly. Definitely recommend coming to this location.</review>

Super convenient if you come by the hospital or work there. This location is hard to notice from across the street. Its actually behind 711.

Here's the thing I didn't like. I couldn't switch the veggies out for coleslaw but I would have to pay $1+ as an additional. I never had this problem so it was super weird this location was like this.<//Text>< username>

<Text>This is not the place to go if you want good customer service.  The cashier “xrafa” is very rude and not friendly.  The manager instead of providing better service than her employees doesn’t. I went because I like the food and the coupons kept me going to this location but there’s another Yoshinoya with way better service.  They won’t take your coupon if the numbers aren’t showing yet I went to the one on Daly and they didn’t hesitate, talk about great customer service.  This location lost a customer and by the way it’s always empty now I know why. Go to the Yoshinoya on Daly it’s way BETTER!!!<//Text><UserId.>106282204131873048306< /UserId.>< gmapID>

<review>Good food. Fast service if you keep it without time wings and spring rolls.
Tables & condinent area was not cool. The cashiers need to be more on it. I used to work at the Yoshinoya on San Fernando infront of the Denny's. I always had my store clean with my customers happy even when busy. I never got a complaint. Besides that food is good.

If you expecting more go to the Yoshinoya on San Fernando. The female owner is really kind. But I'm advising you never to work there only eat there. Take my word for it lmfao</review>< pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Very bad. Miss said. THERE ARE NO COMBOS.

WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOU BUY ALL APPARATUS.

We tactfully insist on spending less. We cancel the entire order. Then the Mexicans condemned us. And he sold us what we wanted at a reasonable price.

That after negotiating and waiting a long time. About 20 minutes

(Original)
Muy malo. La señorita dijo. AQUI NO HAY COMBOS.

NOS QUERIA OBLIGAR A COMPRAR TODO APARTE.

Con tacto insistimos en gastar menos. Cancelamos toda la orden. Despues condesendió con nosotros los Mexicanos. Y nos vendió lo que nosotros queríamos a precio razonable.

Eso despues de negociar y esperar mucho tiempo. Como 20 minutos.<//Review>

<review>Peter and Jeff were great today. They got my 44k mile 99 996 fixed up. Gave me a really honest inspection and even did a few small things for me no charge. Glad I found these guys. Going to be my go-to independent Audi and Porsche shop from now on. Oh also, same day turnaround!!! That's unheard of for these sort of cars.<//review><user_id>101941995103301758930<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80c2b9056d2935cb:0xefb500e80d698f0d<//Gmap_id></record>

These guys are absolutely great. They are friendly and help provide an explanation of what they are doing. I came in for an air bag light on my Audi S3. They did such a great job, I brought in my wife's GTI as well and they helped get it back in shape. This will be my go to auto shop from here on out. Thanks guys!< /Text>

I have been going to Euro Spec for the last 7 years. I won't let anyone else touch my car aside from Jeff and Peter. They are honest and trustworthy. So thankful for their services. I recently moved outside of the city and will still be making the drive to them for the needs of my vehicle. They've never let me down! Thanks for being the best of the best! Much love!</Text>

<Text>I recently purchased a Porsche Cayenne on a whim and took it to Euro Spec for a full inspection. It was important to me to find a reliable and experienced shop. I found Peter to be incredibly friendly as soon as I called to make my appointment. He was very accommodating to my schedule and very helpful. I felt confident in the quality of the inspection and the information that Peter shared with me. I felt that I could trust him, which is always incredibly important with mechanics.  And the price for the inspection was about $200 less than a neighboring Porsche/Audi shop. Unfortunately,  I'll be leaving the state soon but Peter will definitely be my Porsche guy for as long as I'm in the area. I would absolutely recommend Euro Spec Motoring for the quality of their work, friendly customer service and competitive pricing.<//Text>< Pics>

Great service done on my girlfriend's Audi A4. Euro Spec does expert work at a much better price than the dealership. Peter is incredibly knowledgeable and even diagnosed the last issue before the car even got to the shop.</Text>

<review>This place is the best European cars mechanic in LA!!
Peter is incredibly loyal to people and has the best knowledge of mechanics.
After I through so many shady places in LA and found Euro Spec motoring, I couldn’t trust to let any companies touch my car but here. I highly recommend you to check out this place.
Thank you so much Peter for your perfect, decent and fast job and much of your loyalty.<//review>< UserId.>

<Text>I’ve been taking my Audi Q5 to Jeff and Peter for about 3 years now. They’ve helped me out multiple times. They are always reliable, quick to answer, and always willing to stay a bit late to get a job done. They’ve earned my trust.</Text></record>

<review>I can only assume all these positive reviews are fake or paid for, because there was absolutely nothing positive about my experience here.

I left my car for a scheduled repair of the chassis mounts and to replace a break pad. I was supposed to get my car at the end of the day (Wednesday) and made it very clear how critical it was that I do get it back and that if for some reason there is a delay, they let me know. As I said, this was important since I had to pick up my daughter from later that day from the valley. Unfortunately, not only did they not finish with my car that day, they also didn't call me at all. And by the time I tried reaching them, they had left for the day and I was out of luck.

Little did I know, this was just the beginning of my nightmare. Long story short, the same thing repeated itself in the coming days and I ended up only getting my car the following week, without as much of an apology for repeatedly leaving me hanging without a car or a phone call.

Avoid this place at all costs. They don't care about you or your car. A service provider that treats its customers this way doesn't deserve your business, period.<//review>< pictures>

Peter seems like a nice guy on the outside but is shrewd and dishonest. He is one of those mechanics that give new meaning to the word dishonest and is the reason many people have a low opinion of the integrity of mechanics.  He sold me a 2004 Audi Ultrasport stating that the timing belt had been replaced. Well, he lied and a month after buying the car, the old belt snapped taking out the valves and top end.  So now the car is sitting in my driveway waiting until such time as I have an extra $2500 to repair it.  I contacted Peter about this and he denies any wrongdoing despite the fact the timing belt is shredded.  I have the absolute lowest opinion of this shop and would steer anyone clear of them, especially Peter.< /Review>

Very nice staff.  Jeff (my service guy) is very kind and super knowledgeable about Audi’s / Porsche.  Does not try to sell you on things you do not  need.   As long as I’m driving Audi or Porsche I will be coming here for service.<//Text>

Every Audi/Porsche driver I know sees Euro Spec. Peter and Jeff rock. I wouldn’t dream of taking my Audi anywhere else. They’ll shoot ya straight with their no nonsense approach. They’ll fit you in as soon as they can and get you back on the road lickety-split.<//review>

Jeff and Pete are great.  Rarely in theses days do you find two guys that actually like what they are doing.  This means they enjoy working on cars and because of that,  they have pride in their work.

I’ve taken both my 991 and Cayenne to them for various problems and they always fix what ever the problem is, and the price is always fair.  BH porsche wanted $860 to replace my battery and reset the computer.  Jeff took care of it for 1/4 the price and had it washed!!<//Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>This has been our favorite smog store for many years, now.
The owners are so knowledgeable and helpful, and the service is first rate.  They are friendly and punctual.

And the price really IS the lowest.

All good reasons to support this establishment. In fact, we are heading over there now to get a vehicle tested.

I am sorry I didn't leave a review for them before this time. They deserve all FIVES in our experience.

P.S. Written later the same day: On May 4, 2020, they were closed.
We were able to get a great deal at Stop N Go in Perris,</review><date>1588635107012<//date><Response>None<//Response><username>Gayle Geer</username><gmapID>0x80dca123fe90688d:0xf0bfa39ff1460219< /gmapID><userid>116637865396965315661<//userid><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Super friendly fast professional service! Would recommend to anyone without a second thought. Waiting room has snacks priced in the 90's so they're basically free just in case you get impatient for the 5 mins you'll be spending in there.</review>

Excellent customer service. Extremely knowledgeable and educates customers. Owner is extremely honest. Prices were more the reasonable. Large television for the kids in the waiting room.

I called the shop. The answering machine took the call but I didn't leave a message. The owner called me back so I went and had the best smog experience of my life. I was informed and given valuable tips for future smogs. Family atmosphere.</Review>

<review>Super friendly staff. The owner gave my almost 2 year old son a chocolate covered marshmallow while we were waiting too. I was able to talk with him and build a rapport as I am a mechanic myself. I would definitely recommend them and look forward to handing out there business cards to my own customers.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I have never been to a smog check place that offers such amazing service at such a low price! The technician Juan was very nice and helpful. As I waited he offered me a bottled water. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family.</Review><GmapID>0x80dca123fe90688d:0xf0bfa39ff1460219< /GmapID><date>1424122639300<//date><UserId.>107811599611361142191< /UserId.><rating>5< /rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>Joe Demetry< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<review>So unprofessional to have business hours that you don’t show up for! Business hours are 8:30 AM  M-F waited here until after 9:00 AM and still not open. I have seen other reviews for this shop not opening this place is really not worth your time your better off going to a professional business that values the stated business hours!!!!!<//review>< pictures>

I looked online for the lowest priced smog I found this one to be closest and least expensive.
I was literally the first to be helped I got there about half an hour before opening. I was taken care of with a smile as soon as they opened.  I will definitely go back and recommend this place to any one that needs a smog and great customer service.<//Text>

Very professional. I called him and he was about to close but, kept his shop open for me. He quickly completed his work in less than 20 minutes. I will use his services next time and I will recommend his place.</review>

Juan was a really cool guy, down to earth type of guy. I was worried that maybe my car wouldn't pass the smog check, so he performed a pre-test before actually paying for the actual test.< /text>

<text>I was really impressed that I called, got an answering machine, and just hung up and then they called ME back. This guy sincerely wants your business and is making it totally worth your while to come to him for a smog check.
There is nobody in Perris that can beat this price and it really is what he says it is... no hidden costs (like the other guys) and you get a smog test no matter what kind of vehicle you bring in and you pass or you fail.  No games.  It took about 10 minutes.
It's so refreshing to find someone who's main objective is not to rip you off.  His goal is to give the best service and expand his business by being honest, grateful for your business, and, giving the best possible price.
I'm actually not dreading getting my next vehicle smogged because I found someone I can trust to not take advantage of me.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1409212667212, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words.

< Review>
Thanks.  I was calling different smog stations regarding some issues my car had.  No one wanted to help out until I call this smog check.  He was nice enough to explain how the smog check is done.  I was quoted $40 so I came here and got ny smog check.

It failed but I was explained before the test this might happen because my car hasn't been serviced in over 3 years.   Now I know what to fix and the best part is they gave me a discount on the retest.  And they explained how the state can help me fix my car.

You guys rock.<//Review>

WoW!! An honest person who won't take your money needlessly!  I brought my car in for a smog thinking it needed one, but Juan told me according to my DMV info I gave him it did not need one; my car is only 3 years old.  He was right!! It didn't.  I like the way he does business.  Would highly recommend to any women needing car service.</review>

Today is Black Friday so I called for business hours since I figured they would be different from normal hours. The person who answered the phone told me they were open until 5pm today. I headed straight over after work to find that they closed at 2....wasted a trip over here. Thanks for lying!</Review>

<text>This place is a bit out of the way for me, but it's totally worth it! The coffee is smooth and not watery, but it's still reasonably priced. The donuts are fairly priced, and the bagels and sandwiches are downright steals 💕< /text>< pics>

I'll admit: You have delicious Doughnuts, coffee and also - it is like a 1 minute walk to where I live. But the reason why I gave 4 stars is because you guys don't have Gluten-Free Doughnuts I can eat! If you had products like Cinnamon Sugar, or anything from the kinnikinnick brand -- that'll be 100% Great!< /Text>

Best donut shop. I reside in Marina where we have one donut / bagel shop.  It's worth the drive on weekends when donuts call.  I work in Monterey so weekdays when the craving hits I can grab one on the way to work.</Text>

These are the BEST donuts I've ever tasted!!! They are fresh, soft and they are smooth while eating. They also give you a couple of donut holes with your order and OMG!!!! THE BEST! Honestly, they taste like Fruit Loops and it just melts in your mouth! I normally get regular chocolate, chocolate bar with Bulgarian creme, and glaze. Yeah they are original flavors but the dough itself is so smooth and the Chocolate is creamy and not too sweet. Ive also tried their bacon, egg, cheese croissant sandwhich and its good. The coffee is OK. The owner is really friendly. Since i moved here 2 years ago, this was the first place I fell in love with and i will not try any other local donut shops, that includes Red's. I've tried Red's Donuts and they are alright. They have a harder dough texture and just doesn't taste fresh to me.<//review>

The food was good and service fast. Got a bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich on a garlic bagel and a cream filled chocolate doughnut. Both were really good and price was standard for this area. They even tossed in some free doughnut holes. I would say I prefer this place to Red's, another local favorite doughnut shop.<//text>

The man behind the counter was very rude. Half of our chocolate covered donuts have a burnt taste. Red's Donuts are much better - regretting even trying this place.<//review>

<Text>Grew up in Midwest with lots of great donut shops. This place reminds me of Long's Donuts in Indiana - light, not overly sweet or greasy. The anti-Krispy Kreme! Try them out - you won't regret.</Text>< pictures>

Fluffiest and most amazing doughnuts you will taste. I know Red's in the area is great as well, along with Marina doughnuts but Monterey doughnuts are worth it every time and everyone in your office will love you when you bring some in.< /Text>

A friend recommended CJ Deli the last time I was in town. I've been running around all day- and was starving today, thankfully I remembered the tip of CJ Deli.
I did a quick yelp search to make sure they were open and to check the menu. Yes- they are open, and the food sounded great.
My friend and I picked up 2 sandwiches for lunch for takeaway. She had the Natural sandwich and I had the vegetarian.
The natural comes with 2 kinds of cheese- American and Swiss. My friend said she didn't want the Swiss, they offered her an extra slice of American cheese. We got the small sandwiches- still plenty big. We each still have 1/2 to enjoy later.
The vegetarian is really good- I loved the flavors. The bread was so yummy. It's nice and soft- tasted homemade. The sandwich has sprouts, egg, cucumber, and avocado. They also have free add ons  onions, pickles, and jalapeños
The restaurant was very clean, staff was very friendly and efficient.
Plenty of parking available as well.
They are now open for dine in as well as offer takeout< /text>

I work in the area so i come to CJ Deli a few times a week and i must say, i absolutely love this place.  Prices are very reasonable and everything tastes great!  They always use the freshest ingredients too!  Unlike most places, the pictures of their food are true to scale.  They do not minimize portions at all.  I would definitely recommend CJ Deli to anybody who asks.<//Review>

Great choice for lunch in the Cypress area.  I had the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich on a French roll and it was terrific! Cozy seating and really friendly owners.  Wish this sandwich shop was near my place in LA!</Text>

I love the customer service they had there. The employees help save and find deals and with the budget we had. The furniture they had was amazing and with great quality. I would highly recommend coming here if you want to buy furniture.</Text>

Purchased my Mattress here and left completely  satisfied with the customer service and product.
I will definitely be coming back for more Furniture  needs!!!!
Elliott and Amrit were top notch and made my experience easy and simple to purchase. I was out of the store in less than 20 minutes, and got my Mattress delivered to me that same day!!</text>

<text>I LOVE my furniture and had to wait a bit to get it, but life is that way these days. It was delivered today and the gentleman that delivered were 2 brothers. They were so pleasant to work with and very thorough putting everything where I wanted it. Perfect experience!! I would go back and also I would recommend.<//text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

they offer delivery services, delivery cost was $42 for two queen mattresses for 3 miles down the street. they drop off the mattress at the door step and do not set up. they also, do not take away old mattresses for free.

customer service was great, price was great compared to macys and sears. I would recommend offering to pay in cash for more discounts. The store owner is cool.< /text>

If they tell you that you have 6 months to pay it off no interest charge, please don't believe them. Apparently they sent my mother information to ACIMA credit it was for 3 months pay off, every 2 weeks payment and they charge $4 a day for interest. The credit company even said that this company should learn how to be careful of how they explain financial payments and credit to their customers. Not only that, if you are planning to buy furniture and they send you to their warehouse... You will be dealing with a rude an employee, your items will not be there on time ( after several phone calls to the owner that it will be there). No, all you get is a rude employee telling you " I already told her no it's not here", when in reality it was there the whole time. Please believe the bad reviews on here and beware of coming here. We will not be returning here and I hope they don't try to screw over anymore their future customers that come here. Also should I mentioned I wrote a review months months ago but they Owner called me to remove it because they offered a discount. Yeah don't believe that. Look what happened to recent customers. They scammed them by lying about credit financial payments. Stop screwing people over!<//Text>< pics>

I'm going to wrap up a story over many moths of waiting in the making. The owner/head manager had left me to sleep on the floor of my home for over 7 months. After many text reminders to the owner, and different frustrating visits to stop into the store to get updates on how things were progressing (this was before covid) and the owner never being there, I gave up. one of my family members actually drove me back once again and the owners younger brother, Karm, I believe, actually did the owners job faster and absolutely zero hassle even delivered same day I had visited.

So I thank you the younger brother and the delivery man who was so kind and quick to deliver the mattress that I had paid for and making this very simple.</text>

Mattress and Furniture Express were open to negotiate, and expedited my delivery to make sure it was ready for Super Bowl Sunday. I purchased this Friday at 5pm and they had it out to me by Noon the next day.  Talk about clutch.  I misunderstood that my set didn't come with an Ottoman, and they even gave me half off just solid to the mixup.  They are busy for a reason, but find time to give great customer focus.

Amazing customer service!  The store layout is very attractive and comfortable.  Amrit helped us pick out a mattress and was awesome.  Not a high-pressure salesman at all.  He was super helpful in picking out the mattress and setting up our order.  A hundred times better than going to a regular mattress store!< /Review>

DO NOT BUY HERE!!!!!!!! They are very dishonest. The guy Elliot pretends to gave you a deal for a better review. He lied about delivery. The guy who delivered my dining set left  it in a box and refused to assemble despite I told him I would pay him extra... I called the store to complain about assemble, they said they do not assemble. Never did they let me know that they do not assemble. In less than two hours to return, they said they do not return and assemble. Now I am stuck with a box of pieces of furniture. They also talked you into getting their financing. This store is fraud. No one call me back as promised.</review>

<review>Excellent customer service. The owner of this branch was amazing. I purchased a bunkbed unit from him and found it online for a lesser price and wanted to cancel my order. Instead of losing my business he guaranteed me to match the price that I found. I sent him the information and he updated my contract/price. Absolutely amazing. Trust the reviews you will not be disappointed with this business. Disclosure: this may not be the case for everyone but I happened to make the request literally hours after placing my order. I highly doubt this would have been the case if I requested this days later or after delivery. But I promise he will do what he can to make the customer happy. He has great energy and customer service. Amazed.</review>< pictures>

was amazed with this store. It had a wide selection of furniture and they worked with me to get my items delivered in a timely manner. Despite the pandemic I was very satisfied with my purchase and the delivery. I will definitely be using them again in the near future. Thanks again. Furniture rocks!! I had three men deliver my furniture and they were professional and organized. I am very satisfied with my delivery</Review>

Never buy from here!!!!! They are complete frauds. Please read all the reviews they are not lying. Worst customer service especially from Amrit and Elliot. They push the finacining on to you and lie about prices. They will tell you everything you want to here and then hit you with a price you never agreed to. When you ask for a receipt they say oh we will email it to you but never do. They don’t return phone calls and the owner straight up lies on the phone and says he’s not in when it’s really him who answered. Spend your money else where. They are frauds!!!!!</Review>

I’ve been a returning customer here for several years and have always had a great experience. Their billing is accurate with no hidden fees or surprise changes or charges after a certain period, and financing is really easy. The employees are always really helpful and friendly. I’ve had accounts at other places and this has been the only store I consistently return to. I highly recommend them!! This was my fourth time.</Review>

Very dishonest people. They won't take a return even the next day with a not open box. They offered a price and when you picked up the furniture they send you a lease contract!!! We tried to return the unopen box and they force you to to take it since they don't take returns. We are really disappointed. They don't honor warranty or any kind of offer. The only think that will try to do is take your money. Poor quality too.<//text>

Our shopping experience was excellent. Our furniture came in early. We were contacted to set up an earlier delivery. We were well informed of our delivery date and time. The delivery truck was running ahead so we were notified that our delivery would be a half hour earlier than expected. The delivery guys were very professional and quick. Our entire experience great.

I got two armoires, dining table, bunk beds, split adjustable king bed, reclining sectional and leather sofa. Great quality. Financed all of it!<//review>

<text>My mother came into this store today 1/9/2021 and upon asking about a table set a Caucasian man and another associate named Omar discriminated against my mother and told her she don’t have enough money to afford the table she was looking for and that the table they advertised was not there in store and she would have to travel to Yuba City to get it after she called and talked to someone in the store and they told her it was there in stock and for $209. They turn around and tell her again for a second time she don’t have enough money to afford the table because the way she dressed and looks and upon her telling him that was rude and not satisfactory customer service the Caucasian man walked away from her. This is so uncalled for and that man should lose his job. I am going to report this to the BBB! DO NOT SHOP HERE!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Illegal bait and switch. Was told over the phone that they had a $89 queen mattress in stock. In store I asked to see the $89 queen, they showed me one, I liked it, and when I went to pay, they told me the price was $200, and that "Oh, we actually don't have the $89"< /Review>

When shopping at this store, Elliot and karm were very nice and friendly. He greeted me with a huge smile and gave me plenty of options to choose from, when I told the owner that I only had $500 at the moment he was very understanding and he negotiated a price for me and made sure to schedule me a delivery right away, also they have great conversation and make you feel comfortable, I would highly recommend them and this will be my furniture spot from now on!!<//review>

We received outstanding service the last 2 purchases we’ve made.   Both purchases were made within the last 60 days.

Both times we went in knowing exactly what we wanted. The transactions went smoothly.

Our most recent purchase was delivered to our home. The delivery person was very nice.
We got a power grey sectional!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Mattress Furniture Express is one of the best experiences I have had in searching for furniture.  When I have made inquiries your sales personnel have always responded promptly and professionally.  I love the quality of furniture that you have and am looking for a dining room set and a high four post rice bed.  I want one that I need a step stool to get into the bed.  Your staff is currently looking for the bed for me.

I like the fact that I am spending my money with a local family owned store.</Review>

< Review>
There are a lot of things to say about this furniture store.....

If you look at a lot of the reviews that are 5 stars a lot of the profiles have ONLY reviewed for this store. Pretty sure they buy reviews considering that they go after those who do write bad reviews and ask them to take it down.

If you look them up on the Better Business Bureau you can see
"Complaints we have received for Mattress & Furniture Express
contain similar allegations. Complainants have alleged the company
delays delivery of orders by weeks or months and refuses to cancel
their orders or provide refunds. They also allege receiving orders with
parts missing or broken"

The company has not responded back to the Better Business Bureau.

This is a a family business that have several different locations. This particular location is managed by Amrit and is the owner. If you are trying to get direct help don't go in when it is packed. There is not enough staff to manage the amount of people who go in. More than half the staff DOES NOT WEAR MASKS even though they have signs on the door before you enter that you need one. As you can imagine they do not enforce this policy on their customers either.

A guy who does not wear a mask who I believe is named Elliot (who also does not wear a mask) pressures you to buy, tries to get you to sign up for their "loan program", and is constantly distracted with other customers and gives inaccurate prices which later have to be corrected by Amrit in which he gives it for a higher price.

These people are so desperate to make a sale and do not prioritize customer service, when I arrived they were so busy, two people were walking out. They young lady who works there literally ran out to them and tried to get them to apply to their credit financing option and they look disgusted and just left.

The only positive I have is that the people that delivered our furniture were nice but, they were not wearing masks which is very alarming as they were entering our home.

Save yourself the hassle and go to a different furniture store.</Review>

<Review>An incredible experience from start to finish!  I worked with multiple people while shopping, and all of their knowledge far exceeded expectations. If they don’t have exactly what you need in the store, they’ll get it. They care more about getting you what you want, than just making a quick sale. I highly recommend shopping here for quality furniture at great prices!  Thank you.</Review><user_name>Jenny Carlos</user_name>< rate>

From the time I went into the store this business told me what I wanted to hear I bought something received something different for them to end up having the furniture after all. Paid over $1,000 wouldn't deliver it then didn't receive all the peices for a week. Didn't over no help nothing off any kind except a free pillow I forgot to mention they give free if you say you seen their ad. I had to load up the furniture myself onto my SUV! I will never go here again for anything<//Text>

Absolutely beautiful quality furniture! Delivery men were kind enough to take apart the dresser I ordered in order for it to fit up our spiral stairs and then put it back together. I'm so grateful and appreciative of the work they did. Delivery within 4 hours< /Text>

Since I first stumbled across her store,  Karm has been amazing.  Her team is also top notch.  Whenever I need new furniture, I go to him first.  He has great ideas.  And if he doesn't have something, he scours the ends of the earth to find what you need/want.  Personal service has been lost somewhat in this world, and it's refreshing to see it back.</text>

Easy to look around and find what we needed. Good selection. Guy at the counter was extremely helpful, especially with delays and issues concerning Covid-19. Took extra time to check out all options on the quickest delivery of our furniture. Very friendly. Not the first time we’ve purchased from here and definitely won’t be the last!! Went to 4 stores who are were out 8 weeks.
Delivery within 4 hours how do you beat that< /review>

Unprofessional set up in their "showroom".  They have 20-30 couches and mattresses with no walkways from the front to the back of the store. My pregnant wife and I had to crawl over furniture just to browse. None of the salesman had on uniforms so you had random men asking," are you finding everything alright?" As you run the couch obstacle course. Nothing had pricing which is an obvious gimmick and sales tactic which forces you to admit interest in an item so they can haggle. Don't come here.< /text>

I have mixed feelings! The quality of the couch is wonderful! I love it. But I was disappointed when the sales guy said it would be delivered next day and it took 4 days to actually come. When I called to ask they said a different day and the delivery guy would call me.So that's 4 days of waiting if it would get delivered. Another issue I had was that they didn't even assemble it. That would have been helpful to know.
One piece had the thread coming apart but they were quick to respond being apologetic.</Text>

<review>I walked into Mattress and Furniture Express in Roseville and was immediately welcomed by friendly employees. I found exactly what I wanted and was approved for a payment plan that was very convenient. The process was a total of 30 min.. very efficient and easy!!

Had a great experience from the moment I walked into the store I didn't feel rushed or pressured. I was able to get a high quality living room set for an incredible price and the delivery guys were very respectful and set up my furniture exactly how I wanted. Good job guys keep up the good work and I would highly recommend star furniture to my friends and family!<//text>

Were being generous with one star.  We purchased a mattress and was never called for delivery.  We were not told we would have to go to their warehouse to pick it up.  I offered to pay for delivery and still no call back for three days more.

We got tired of waiting so we drove to Roseville out by denio’s auction actually in their auction, tried to pick up our originally bought one but lo and behold they didn’t have anymore so they gave us a substitute which is not as good as the pillow top we paid for.

Total nightmare from beginning to end.  Never going back!</Review>

Elliott was knowledgeable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. She went out of her way to answer my questions and further to make certain I understood the answers. He is enthusiastic and personable. I look forward to working with him.<//Text>

Do not bother wasting your time or money here. They sell.empty promises. Amrite never came thru with the replacement cushion for a couch I bought. Told me 4-5weeks. Its been 6 months. He doesn't even respond or call back. they are doing bad business and are shady.</text>

Very good prices. Great service even though its a family owned and operated store. Only a few employees but they were all quick to help and explained every possible option that they had available. Will be back soon. The furniture is very nice with many grey options. My wife loved Gary. He was amazing! Furniture looks good and they have more options in the back.< /Text>

<Review>from the moment we walked in until we left we had a great experience. there was someone right away to greet us. he was very nice and courteous, listened to everything we had to say/was looking for. we were showed many options and he was very patient with us going back and forth and stopping to look and discuss multiple things. he also explained the sales they had going on, he wasnt too pushy on one certain item and at the end of it he gotten us a good deal. will definitely go back for more furniture. My cousin mandy got an adjustable base and power recliner she really likes. I'm going to ask her how she likes it and will keep you updated. I want a massaging bed.<//Review><user>113266542879827665424<//user><time>1592967384399<//time><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809b1ff5a61eb657:0x7522c4122f5a7264</GmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

Customer service is not very professional I was told a estimate day for delivery how every they called me a day before the estimated delivery day and said they are doing my delivery now.. which a sooner delivery date is great! However All I asked was for them to come at 3pm because I was not prepared for it to come sooner and I Had to move things around to fit the new furniture we agreed for them to come at 3pm no sooner then that how ever they showed up sooner then that.. I told the man the time we agreed and he got an attitude with me and said they didn’t set a time they just go by there route.. I literally went back and forth with the delivery guy over the phone and we set 3pm he repeated to me okay So after 3pm.. I called to store to let them know my experience and they put me on hold for a while but he manager called me back a few hours later and cut me off again and said he was going to call me back the store was busy yet a week goes by and never heard back from them ..</Text>

Don't advertise online if you have problem answering questions online. When you come in the store you will realize that they do false advertisement. They post a picture online of their most expensive bed and but a price less then $200. Family business of liars, false advertisements and nonexistent customer service.</review>< pictures>

<Review>The TRUTH!

Hi Amrit & staff,

I want to let you know THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP...

Here is my HONEST REVIEW of this place from my personal experience with Amrit & his staff.

September 06, 2020
@12:35pm

My husband & I were helped out by Elliot & made a purchased of an ivory L-shaped sofa with a full payment on the same day. Prop to Elliot! He was super helpful & answer all of our questions.

September 10th, 2020
@12:18pm

I received missed calls a few times from the warehouse & a text message. I called & left a voicemail, but no responses.

September 11th, 2020
@1:36-1:38pm

I text message back the delivery men that I won’t be available to return the call after 6pm because I’m still working.

I text message the store # to let them know that I wasn’t able to get a hold of their delivery men.

@3:39-3:53pm

Delivery men left a voicemail & text message on the same day of delivery, but they couldn’t get a hold of me because I was working. They still delivered my sofa...Luckily, my husband haven’t left to work yet which they delivered the sofa around 12-2pm. But keep in mind my husband start work @3pm & leave the house between 2:15-2:30pm.

Delivery was fast. Our new sofa was delivered within a week. Unfortunately, the delivery men (there was 2 delivery men) broke our new sofa support bar. Was informed they will order a new replacement for the broken support bar & will be in 1-2 weeks.

September 12th, 2020
@11:40am

I sent photos of the broken sofa support bar as I was told to do so from the delivery men.

September 22nd, 2020
@2:34pm

I received a called from the delivery men that my replacement order came in & they will delivered on September 23rd, 2020.

I text message the warehouse/delivery # to contact my husband before they deliver the replacement to make sure someone was home as a friendly reminder.

September 26th, 2020
@9:37am

I messaged & left a voicemail to the warehouse/delivery # that my husband or I never received a called or had our replacement order delivered. I asked, what happened & still no response.

October 4th, 2020
@4-5pm

My husband & I called the store # & asked if the store manager was in today & what was the store manager named. He told me to call on Tuesday because the manager wasn’t in today & the store manager named was Amrit...He put me on hold. My husband and I walked into the store in person while still being on hold on the phone waiting patiently. Amrit answered the phone again, & I answered right in front of him. He then asked me if that was me on the phone. I told him yes. We both hung up our phone. I asked him for his named & he told me his named was Amrit. I asked him, are you the store manager. He say yes. I asked him, were you the same person I was talking to on the phone the whole entire time. He say yes. I then told him you were talking to me on the phone earlier & lied to me that the store manager wasn’t in today & it’s you. He quickly makeup a lie stating the reason why he told me to called on Tuesday because he will have an answer for me by then & to talk to the store manager Amrit...He told me to follow up on October 6th, 2020 (Tuesday) & the replacement order was coming from Vietnam or China & due to COVID-19 shipment was taking longer than expected. So my husband & I kindly & patiently waited & give them a chance to correct their mistakes.< /Review><gmapID>0x809b1ff5a61eb657:0x7522c4122f5a7264<//gmapID>< Pics>

Great Customer Service-Great Products!  Refer all of my family here! STOP shopping at big box stores-waited on hold with Ashley Furniture for 20 minutes! Called Mattress Express-got great service, just what I was looking for and the order was ready for me in 5 minutes after talking to them:)< /text>

Best store I have been into a long time. Got my couches super quick, actually next day. I was able to get a nice less expensive bunk bed as well. Very happy with the products and service. I am going to also buy their rustic bed they have when you walk into the door. Do the no credit payments, make sure you pay it 90 days.< /Text>

Went here and was somewhat skeptical if I would purchase anything because prices are largely absent from their website. I’m so glad I did. Amrit was amazingly helpful and knowledgeable. He took time to listen to my needs while patiently answering all of my questions. I’m definitely going to be back to get more stuff as I finish unpacking. I highly recommend this store, and Amrit. Delivery was a breeze, and the guys who brought my furniture were friendly, nice, and very careful not to damage it or my walls. Make it your first stop when shopping.<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Roseville Ca location. Delivery guy broke a support beam during delivery. Store owner/manager has been giving different dates for replacement. When their delivery guy said it would be delivered and replaced within a 1-2 weeks since they have it in their warehouse but now its changed up to 6-8weeks saying that the wooden support bar is coming from "vietnam/china". Bogus story. Worst customer service ever! Also, called and ask to talk to the manager and was told the manager (Amrit) was not in but when me and my wife went in to the store as we hung up the phone and talk to the guy that told us that. He says he's Amrit and he's the manager. Lies after lies. Bad management, bad business. All they do is give excuses after excuses in hopes you forget so they get your money and dont have to deal with you.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Never go here!! Literally go anywhere else!! This was absolutely the worst shopping experience I’ve ever had. I was only in the store less than 5 minutes. They were rude, arrogant conmen. The deals they put in the windows are fake and if you get a payment plan they don’t tell you that the interest makes $800 worth of furniture into +$1900!! AND I gave them $100 cash down payment that was never reported!! They go through everything way too fast and push past important details and make it seem like you’re prequalifying when you are actually applying but they type everything in to the computer so you can’t see. And the items I received were was worse quality than what I saw in the store. Literally nothing pleasant about the experience</Review>< Rating>

<Review>Arrogant bunch of guys.. They advertise items they dont have in store, they dont answer any questions online, they try to get you to get on there payment plan because they steal a bunch of interest from you, products are very cheaply made, the energy in the small little space of a store is extremely evil, I will never go back in there and I will not recommend this place to anyone. Im wondering how they got good reviews. Beware of this family of liars and frauds.</Review>< response>

Moving in can be pricey, not here! Catalogs showed the beautifulest furniture with the most affordable prices! Grabbed love seats sofas & a bedframe/mattress, I do live out of the area so it was definitely worth the drive. The main guy Amrit is super cool & blunt. Me having concerns, He even added additional pieces for me at no charge because he was just so outstanding etc. Definitely recommend and will come back for the next move!< /Review>

He answered our questions on grades of leather and explained the quality of the pieces we liked. He ran the numbers and went over everything with us.

Place was great. They have most things that the big box stores do, and they were very helpful.  Didn't rush me or try to push us for a bigger sale.  Elliot was very helpful and got us what we needed in less then 30 minutes.<//review>

<Text>I am very pleased with the quality of the furniture.  I, however, would have thought that the salesperson would have at least called to see if everything was right with the furniture compared to the way it was ordered. We ordered a lot of furniture. To that I am not sure if I am more surprised or disappointed or maybe both.< /Text>< user_id>

Sales rep Amrit was AMAZING! I had my little one tagging along, she slept half the time I was there. He made sure to stop by every sofa I wanted to see, even joked around with her. Patiently waited while she had a terrible two melt down. We will be back for the up and down moving adjustable base. These guys were the only ones open during the whole crazy corona thing!<//Text>

This is probably my most favorite furniture store in Sacramento area. I got a fantastic entryway table from here for $199. Everyone always talks about how beautiful it is when they come over and they can't believe the price I got it for. I also purchased a sideboard cabinet and loveseat from here and again it was a great price and I absolutely love it! I have a small house and they found me everything at the store or in the book they have.< /Text>

<review>Elliot and Amrit took very good care of me. The care they put into making sure my needs were met was out of this world. It’s rare you find places like this that actually care and not just in it for the money. Definitely will be spending more with them in the future ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you guys for this amazing shopping experience<//review>< rating>

Prices were good, the furniture was good, and the service was excellent. The owner gave us a few discounts for buying in bulk and when they brought the couch we told them there was a tare so they replaced it the very next day. I liked that they were quick! The tare was done by us and they still replaced it! Great company.</review>

<review>Do not by any means waste your money here. We bought what we were told high quality furniture and a mattress.  The "high quality" furniture started peeling with in the first month. The mattress started bowing with a couple weeks. Leaving indentations where we laid. (NO we're not fat) We complained so they replaced everything but took several weeks. Then everything they brought us started the same situations with the furniture AND the extremely cheap mattress.  This stuff is garbage. We are extremely disappointed with the decision we made to purchase from this hole in the wall and will never do it again.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I wanted to post a review on the excellent customer service that I received from the manager, Amrit. I had a defective issue with my couch that was purchased less than a year ago and he handled my claim with the highest professionalism and was taken care of within a timely manner. I do plan on making future purchases there based on how my issues was resolved and would recommend any future clients of mine as well. These guys are great! Small businesses are the best businesses!</review>

They were super nice and very helpful was my original post but I have to say stay away. They didn’t go over financing details. They input incorrect information to their financing company about my income. When I ordered from them they said I would have everything in a week, and it took 2 months of back and forth. When I told them to take back their stuff they told me they have a NO RETURN policy. Which is against the law I just found out. Now I am paying almost 2000.00 a month to pay for this furniture. I feel completely swindled!!!!! The man who was handling this said he hadn’t started my payments yet  when I hadn’t received my order yet. They never went over the final price with me or anything. I was stupidly trusting due to all the good reviews. Stay away from this store!!!!<//Text>

Bought a sectional couch this weekend and not only did he give me a great deal but worked with my schedule to deliver it the next day. Definitely worth taking a look if you are looking for something nice that is affordable.<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>Went in and bought couch we wanted after looking around at a few different locations. Asked for specific color was guaranteed delivery by certain date and delivery was several days later with incorrect color. Didn’t want to go through the hassle of returning and exchanging and kept the incorrect colored couches we paid $2500 for. Seems like once the sale is over they don’t care about customer service. Didn’t even offer a resolution or sales credit for messing up our order. We were going to come back for bedroom and patio furniture but they blew it with shotty customer service. Not even an apology. Granted we didn’t pick up there calls but when I responded to his text and texted my displeasure not even a response.< /text>< pictures>

<text>We bought a king size mattress and everything went smoothly until we got to the warehouse and found out it rang up as a queen. The warehouse guys were awesome and tried to switch us out to a king on the spot, but unfortunately they were out. We went back to the store and they upgraded us to the next level mattress at the same price.

OUTSTANDING customer service. Will buy from them again based on how they resolved this issue.< /text><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

We have enjoyed our new mattresses for several weeks now and we are very satisfied with our purchase.  We chose your Minnesota Mattress Factory after I did two months of research into what would be the best mattress material for comfort, durability and overall value.   Once we decided on 100% natural latex we were disappointed that most of the trendy mattress stores did not carry it.  Our internet search led us to you and we are very pleased with not just the mattress but the personal service you provided especially with the care you took with the delivery process that including the removal of our old bed.  We would recommend your products and services to anyone. Thanks.</text>

We came in to purchase a specific bedroom set my wife found online. Once we explained what we wanted the associate showed us a much nicer set that better fit our needs and costed less. They went out of their way to work with us on delivery request. Highly recommended taking a look at this location for your furnishing needs.< /Review>

5 weeks agoooo
First thing when I stepped into the store Tracy greeted me with a warm welcome.
I knew approximately what kind of mattress I wanted but wasn't sure how to choose and which materials the mattresses are made of.
I had a specific budget and he was really nice and tried to work with my budget giving me the best option he has.
I went to check a few other stores and came back especially cause of the great customer service he provided.
I ended up with a great mattress and Awsome deal! Thank you Tracy so much!< /Text>

This company has flooded the market with false advertisement stating starting prices to draw people in. It’s a waste of time for one and shady for two. Just post the actual price for items! They’ve posted items all over Facebook with misleading information and when you try and I ask they play dumb well I’m not sure what your talking about when you show them the conversation they try and blame it on the marketing team it’s not the first time I’m debating filing a complaint with the state now.<//Review>

Really helpful staff.  Very friendly.  Made me feel comfortable.  I bought a bed from here and it was definitely worth the money that I spent on it. The staff a give me a discount on my delivery. If I wanted another bed I definitely go here.  Plus on top of that has a warrenty for 15 years.  Nice selection of furniture to choose from too.  The bed is very comfortable. Very happy with my adjustable base.12 months financing!</text>

Found Matress Express through a google map search and very happy with the end result. My husband and I were looking to buy a sofa, and with the prices this store had, we were able to buy a sofa and a love seat. The owner and sales rep were very friendly and helpful. They respected the features we said we were interested in and didnt try to up-sale us. With home delivery for a fraction of the cost at other stores, and great deals, this was a win-win.<//review>

<review>Bait and switch store.  I was terribly disappointed when I was quoted a mattress over the phone and invited to come by the same day to pick it up.  When I arrived, they did not have the promised mattress but they would happily up sell me to a different model.<//review>< Pics>

Delivered the wrong bed and acted like it was an accident. They changed the bed on us 3 times said they didn't have it in stock.  What's the point of the catalogs if you can't get the stuff.  This place is a scam!< /Review>

I've never felt so pressured to purchase anything in my life. We were told that if we left he knew we wouldn't come back when, in reality, we were planning on coming back and ordering the furniture we were looking at. The salesman attitude was incredibly overwhelming even though the price was right. We ended up driving 30 minutes out of our way to feel no pressure and spend more money the same day< /Text>

<time>1587090118712<//time><rate>1</rate><Review>I just went there to purchase a sofa and the customer serviced provided was in the lowest form possible. For starters, the prices they advertise online are not the prices they quote you when inside the store. The sales person was extremely rude and pushy. When I informed him that the reason I came was due to an add I saw on fb, he just shrugged. (So basically we see an add for a couch listed for $349 but the same couch is actually $2,100?!!!)

"Ok, I'll make you a deal" he rushes, "if you buy right now!!"

When we asked what the deal was, he responded with "Are you serious about buying! You don't seem serious about buying". Wow! Rude!! (Side note: If we weren't serious about buying why would we be there money in hand in the 1st place!?!)

He had a couch on his phone he kept shoving in our faces. He seemed upset that we weren't making the deal in the 7 minutes since we walked through the door. We asked for measurements so that we can determine if the piece would fit in our living room and his response "I don't have it but don't worry it'll fit"

BUYERS BEWARE: This place is a complete scam. I would it a -5 stars if possible!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<text>I had almost forgotten what good customer service was like until I had the pleasure of meeting Amrti at Mattress Furniture Express store. Amrti was very informative and helpful in our search for a good mattress set and because of her expertise I now sleep comfortably through the night without waking up every 30 minutes. We also got some furniture that seems to be of good quality. It was a small sofa chaise. I’m so used to sales people just wanting to sell me anything just because its beneficial for them and it was such a nice breath of fresh air to work with a sales person that genuinely cared about my concerns and asked appropriate questions in order to get the best product for me.</text>< time>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>had been shopping for  an adjustable frame and new mattress at various chain mattress stores and was receiving the same unacknowledged  information form all of them. I was mind boggled as to who to believe and what to buy. I went on line and reviewed all the possibilities of mattress stores. I was so in pressed with the reviews that I read, that I decided to make the drive to there store. I can't tell you how glad I did. There knowledge, time spent, patience,  questions ask, and selection,  convinced me I had found the place  that i would buy my new bed.  I am now the owner of a new pillow top mattress, with adjustable/message frame, and couldn't be happier. The deal I got I couldn't walk away. So,If you are looking for a new bed, take a little drive and go see the staff you  will be glad you did.  Its nice to support a small business that hires good honest, knowledgeable people. Good luck.</Text>< name>

They didn't have the item that they had posted on offer up. They post things then when u contact them about it they tell you to come to an address which is the store

They never delivered the furniture I ordered. I took a day off to wait for them. They didn't show up nor call to notify me that they weren't coming. When I called the next day they informed me that they had ordered it in the wrong color. I then inquired about why there was a lack of communication. They had no answer. After about nearly a month of back & forth trying to receive the furniture I ended up having to pay someone else to pick it up. They have not removed the delivery fee. After filing two disputes no resolution & I'm still being harassed/charged for the fee. Horrible business
Part of the furniture was defected
When I notified them within an hr of picking it up they responded with a rude /sarcastic text
They then wouldn't answer my call & texted that someone would call me. Ph started going straight to VM. Never received that call.</review>

Worst place I have ever been to. The manager was super pushy and kinda aggressive. Ran my credit and opened a credit card without my authorization. No papers or signatures or anything. Told me that he there was no reason to keep shopping around and that he knew I wasn’t going to be coming back if I left. Prices were false advertised. Just super aggressive and very unprofessional.< /Review>

They promised a Scotchgarded couch (the OWNER promised it) and my couch doesn’t have it. & my chaise isn’t on the right side. Even when i went in the store Elliot kept bouncing around, I could never get his full attention. The customer service is horrible.<//Text>

Love this place!! Just bought our second mattress from Amrit and we are completely pleased. The shopping experience is always quick, easy and enjoyable. Amrit is very friendly and you can tell he cares about his product quality and his customer's satisfaction. You also just can't beat his low prices. We will always buy mattresses from Amrit! They also carry sofas and big sectionals. My friend Steve got a really nice sectional and is still happy with it! It is tucked away in the hobby lobby shopping center but they even have bunk beds, daybeds, and a big dining set I want!< /Text>

This is an absolutely amazing store! The selection is incredible and I found so many  beautiful things. The credenzas, benches, bedroom furniture is all so gorgeous and true Mexican Rustic Style. Not only is their selection superior to any other stores i have been to for Mexican style furniture and furnishings, and the prices are terrific. Everyone who helped us was so sweet and wonderful. I cannot wait to go back. Habla espanol.<//Review>

We've bought several pieces of furniture here and have loved each and everyone of them. Great quality and great people. Love going into a store and having them remember who you are. The top grain leather set is our favorite til date.<//Review>

<Text>Wonderful selection of in stock furniture. I stopped in at Mattress & Furniture Express Roseville after shopping all weekend for the perfect dining set.  I was about to settle for one at another store and that's when I happened upon this great local store.  I was shocked at the great prices and selection.  My salesperson Amrit was great and listened to what I told him I was looking for.  With his help I found the perfect dining set, which was in stock and I was able to take home that day.  Great experience and I will definitely be back. There was a small leather loveseat I almost bought but will buy it next time! The sofas had made in America signs which makes me happy!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809b1ff5a61eb657:0x7522c4122f5a7264< /Gmap_id><rating>5<//rating>< Response>

<name>Keisha White</name><Review>This is my new favorite furniture store. I found them on Facebook 2 months ago. I called them yesterday I had a few questions, I talk to Andy he helped me from start to finish, he got me approve instantly and got me a bed over the phone. I went in today with my boyfriend, we was coming in to look for couches I was greeted by Elliott he's nice and sweet guy, then Andy helped us. My boyfriend got approve and Andy let us know that we can upgrade the bed set I order the day before and it wouldn't be a problem to do so. We ended up switching mattresses and bed frame, he let us know that since my boyfriend got approve as well we can just move it to one account and make it more easier so it will be 1 payments and not 2 payments and we ended up getting a couch set as well. Elliott & Andy was patience with us because when we came in we didn't know what kind of couches we wanted we just needed couches because we was moving into a new place.

I highly recommend people to come check it out.

We will be back for a Vanity & Dining Table.<//Review><UserId.>114963412589191132256</UserId.>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I found out about this place by driving by - it's between Hobby Lobby and ross, close to where I work.  It specializes in rustic furniture which I love.   I had purchased a number of beautiful items in a wonderful store in East LA, and didn't think I would find a rival for it, especially in Roseville.

They have beautiful items.  I had looked at the website, and think that you need to go to the store and look in person to really get the feel of the store.  I don't think the website does the store justice.

I meant just to see whether there were any chairs that matched my bar, but ended up walking out with a number of very cool things - including a really nice sectional set. I thought my fiancé would really like it. I also got a wooden heavy table which is a beautiful deep oak which I am using as a main table.  It can be also be used for storage.

Of the five things that I purchased, I was given a discount on 4 -- I was totally not expecting that.  The regular prices are reasonable. The lady explained for customers who made larger purchases, that was their practice.  Very cool!</Review>< pics>

What a breath of fresh air! When I saw the windows stickers that say 70% Off I figured it was a gimmick but when I gave it a shot the owner was really helpful and knowledgeable. I bought one of those Gel beds with an adjustable base for a fraction of the price I saw it at Big name Mattress stores. They delivered that same day!! Love love my bed!! I've already sent in two neighbors.</Review>

{'time': 1548201478205, 'text': 'Jessica,\n\nAt first glance I was very upset at the staff and had a talk with them regarding this issue. As I looked into my records I didn’t see your name anywhere. I then glanced at your other review. You have 2 reviews, both of them being mattress shops (Ironic but I’ve seen crazier). (You can view this by clicking on her profile). You wrote that the other mattress shop was great and gave you $40 down financing same as cash option. That is a no credit check program, (100 days same as cash) the same we would have offered you. So their exact same offer was different than ours? Totally doesn’t make sense.\n\nThis review is clearly from a competitor.'}<//Response>

<review>We've been having issues since we first made our purchase. If we knew it would be this terrible, we would have never bought our mattress here. Also, the employees are INCREDIBLY UNPROFESSIONAL over the phone. They always sound like they're in a rush and never take the time to help us with our problems. They also have been saying they would call us back MULTIPLE times and we never heard from them at all. To put it into perspective, our first phone call was June 14th. Also, the last time we called, the guy had the nerve to ANSWER ANOTHER PHONE CALL WHILE WE WERE STILL ON THE LINE. We never got a call back resolving our issue. Our main issue:
First we were told our first payment would be June 28th. Well we were charged out of the blue on June 14th, 2 weeks early. We called and called and called and called AND CALLED. Kept getting the same response: we'll call you back. NOTHING. One guy told us to go ahead and file a dispute with our bank, so we unfortunately did. When we didn't get a call back, we went ahead and tried to search for the credit company that they went through. They told us that our payments for July were being skipped because the store put in the wrong pick-up date. Yesterday,we wish we had known that we shouldn't have filed a dispute because our total was DOUBLE for yesterday's payment, which caught us off guard. So we called the credit company again and they told us that it was double because we filed a dispute with our bank. But we would never have filed the dispute if the employee from the store hadn't encouraged us to do it. The representative we spoke to on the phone for the credit company went ahead and filed a complaint for us and sent an email to the department that handles these issues,so at least there's that.
We were hoping to buy a couple couches and a bed frame from them by the end of the year, but nope, not anymore.They are no longer receiving and money from us. We even recommended this place to a friend, but after telling him our issue, he changed his mind and went elsewhere, too.
This is probably the longest review I've ever written, but it was worth the time.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Best place in Roseville or lets say Sacramento to buy a mattress. Super great deals on adjustable mattress that go up and down. I got a massage bed with up and down for 1/3 of the price and I'm not exaggerating. Other places it's like buying a car. I also got a new nice twin for 59 bucks brand new. Great service with same day delivery and cheap prices on brand name stuff<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I’m not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical at first. I called this company, said I needed a certain type of mattress and they said they could get it to me within an hour. I am a bit cynical by nature and was certain this was a scam. Despite my reservations, I was in a bind. I was in town for a day to help move my son into his first apartment. Time was not on my side and all of the other mattress quotes I had received were double. I decided to take a chance. This turned out to be a great move. The mattress was just what my son was looking for,l  ( the person with whom I communicated) went above and beyond to be helpful and the person who delivered the mattress was lovely (with a very sharp sense of humor .) I don’t know how they do it, however, I would definitely recommend!<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Gave so much attitude and lied so much to us. We bought a bed set first lied about prices then we didn’t get to get our bed set for MONTHS and finally the owner lied to us and to make up for it gave us cheap pillows. Also walked in one time and heard a lady complaining because their ads on Facebook were fake. They are so unprofessional and give u a piece of paper for proof of purchase. The father and sons are all liars and act as if they are still in their home country and it isn’t the US.  And if you guys change your mind and want a refund they won’t do it and they will argue with you till you run out of the store.< /review><gmap_id>0x809b1ff5a61eb657:0x7522c4122f5a7264<//gmap_id>< Response>

The guy that runs the place is kinda... Well hes a salesman and hes rather good at being a salesman. He got me with stuff I used when I was in the sales business. The "oh I dont know if this will be available in a few days?.." The good old fashioned, "Ill knock some of the delivery cost." It was a decent price for a decent mattress. Over all theyre alright.< /Review>

Typical car sales man tactics here. I requested pricing on a very specific mattress they advertised for. Great prices were quoted but after driving in horrible traffic from Sac to Roseville, the price  was nearly $300 more than  what I was quoted.  Very disappointed. They were friendly so they had that going for them but they will do and say whatever to make the sale.😔<//review>

Also after leaving the store the bedroom set that I was promised was no longer available and I went through much trouble trying to be compensated. Not worth the hassle. Wouldn’t purchase from here again.

Amrit was great! He got me exactly what I was looking for and I left feeling satisfied and excited for my new bed! The staff stayed after closing and answered all of my questions and concerns. Thank you mattress express!</review>< pics>

We were in the market for a new mattress. My husband found this place on Facebook. We decided to check it out. It did not disappoint. Elliott was a big help. We ended up finding a nice new mattress at a great price.< /text>

One stop shop. Got sofas and dining set. Superb customer service. Order the up and down base. It is worth it. We did the no credit payment option. Andy was very slow and thorough explaining how it works.</review>

Very happy with our purchase. We financed our bed and paid it of in 67 days. (I couldn’t wait to pay it off hate having payments I owe on). I thought it was weird the sales associates told me that they can’t put it to the 90 days I would have to call. I thought he was just being lazy but I’m so glad that I asked the company and he wasn’t lying. Legally everyone gets defaulted to the 12 months but as long as you pay it off in 90 days you have no interest charged. Oh and you can call and get it changed to the 90 days. I gave the sales guy a hard time but hey guys Red and I love the bed. Thank you.< /Text>

There was some man in the store and his card wasn't working. I guess someone stole his card or something and after numerous attempts the card still wouldn't work. So the owner gives him the bed without payment vowing the guy would pay him the next day. Are you serious???? This bed was for his kid and this grown man, almost 50,  started crying in disbelief. The guy had moved from Arizona.  Who has that big of a heart nowadays????? He took this man's word. I told him he was real gutsy for that. I for sure bought a bed from this man. We got the up and down base and am loving it. It was delivered in 5 hours of purchase. I will forsure tell all my family and friends. Very good straight forward honest service!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x809b1ff5a61eb657:0x7522c4122f5a7264</GmapID></record>

I don’t do reviews but this calls for it. Last Sunday I’m moving from far far away...long story short I call say can you stay open til 730 I need mattress today. I thought I would tie it on my car. Well I get there at 815 with Amrit still waiting. He was not upset at all. I had done some research and new which beautyrest black model I wanted. His prices were about 700 dollars less and the owner Amrit loaded it and brought it to Rancho Cordovo where I moved. Excellent people and service....< /text>

My family was able to get there sofas and furniture here as well. Very friendly and honest service. My family also bought at their yuba city store. They carry everything and are not pushy at all. I financed my bed and they really took care of us. My aunt bought an adjustable bed that goes up and down with massage.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Amrit was a wonderful salesman. He asked our budget and then showed us only things within that range, unlike the other stores that continue to try to sell you a 1,000 dollar mattress after you've told them your budget is well under that. He was knowledgeable about the different firmness levels and helped me pick the right fit for me. I've heard mattress shopping can be stressful, like buying a car, so i was very pleased with Amrit. Super laid back and not at all pushy, but also got right to the point of what he could do for us in terms of price. Much better experience than the other 7 mattress stores we'd been to. Even though our budget was low, he still treated us like valued customers. Very good experience, would recommend to anyone to go here.</Review><user>113682612474112647380< /user>< pics>

<Text>came from rancho for these guys. got fat hook up and love my new bed. The sofas look great and the prices are so cheap...

10 months later.... I am extremely disappointed, I have to replace this lumpy bumpy mess already. I live and sleep alone, this has turned out to be the worst purchase I have ever made, I would have been better off getting a foam mattress in the box at Walmart. This company offers no guarantees on their products, I'm highly disappointed.< /Text>< date>

Wasted my time going there.  They had items on OfferUp with a picture of a $700+ item with an advertisement saying starting at $129.  The salesy pitch came right away, with options of financing etc.  The specific item advertised wasn't even in the store but at a warehouse nearby.  Basically a waste of time.</review>

<text>this a great place to buy brand new mattresses and sofa. great people
I will be back for dining sets.
Amrit was amazing.
We didnt have all the money and he still gave me the product and let me take the mattress.
I dont know many people who would do that.
Very good small business.

I cant thank them enough.
My daughter really needed a bed.</text>< rating>

He had this crazy lady in front of me who, quite frankly, I even I was losing my patience with.....It was a cool experience (mattresses aren't that interesting and I despise doing this every few years). The delivery guy forgot my mattress protector and the owner sent someone to my house within 30 minutes with a free bee :).</review>< user>

Cheap products, very expensive if you use their credit company and they take paperless transactions to a whole new level.

Ripped Off. FAKE REVIEWS

Led to believe was buying a mattress when it came was given a cheaper model. The receipt is vague and poor enough to justify that is what was being purchased.

No Return policy means we are stuck with a mattress that could have been purchased cheaper elsewhere.

Just hoping to pass on this lesson to prevent others from same pain. MAKE SURE YOUR RECEIPT LABEL'S THE EXACT MODEL YOU WILL RECEIVE.

also take a look at the reviews and reviewers might find some similarities..<//review>

Great service great price. We went all around to find a good cheap quality adjustable base and gurst bed but were unsuccessful. We were able to find them here for half the price. Super friendly and honesty with no upsell. The guy had done it for many years way cheaper than the bigger stores< /Review>

Giving them one star because there isn’t an option to just give them zero stars.  They lied about delivery time, lied about the amount of months interest free, and they advertise low prices but when you get to the store is not true.  SCAMS.  Don’t go there.  Not to the Roseville location.<//text>

< Review>
These guys did wonders for  my little one and I. I came in and had very little money and they didnt pressure me or make me feel like I wasn’t worth their time. These guys even delivered it at 730 that same night after I came at 615.

The people here are very awesome and deserve credit. I obviously read reviews before coming and didnt know if I wanted to do the payment option. Well I was explained the process pretty thoroughly and obviously cant speak for anyone else but they told me all the in’s and outs. I think the problem is you have to call yourself and tell them you want to pay it sooner. Amrit told me he could not do that and I didnt believe him but the financing company confirmed.

Gave these guys a shot over the bigger guys and really like my beds. I will say that the beds are firmer when you first get them but now they feel better. I also like my headboard set. I was trying to post a picture but it wouldn’t let me.

Thank you guys a bunch and I hope you guys keep doing well! I will refer many people. My little guy also thanks you guys.</Review>

Perfect shop in Roseville. I was very impressed with how Amrit handled an upset customer. The delivery guys were 30 minutes late to their delivery and the lady came in super frustrated. My husband and I were amazed how upset this guest was over something so small. Well she made a huge scene and Amrit very politely calmed her down and took care of her. I instantly knew I would do business here. My husband and I shopped another place but came back because the prices were way better as well as the salesmen.< /text>

<text>Perfect shop with KILLER SAVINGS. I was looking at a beautyrest for 2500 bucks. The guy even gave me ‘300’ dollars off. I was about to but my new credit card wasn’t working and I left to go see what the fuss was. Well accross the street from chase was Mattress Express Roseville. Got a beautyrest cooling pillows and this cool headboard for half the price. Lovely service and same day drop off.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Where do I start. My back has been killing me for about a month and I thought it may be my old mattress. I went to a couple shops to try some mattresses but the prices are outrageous. One guy wanted to finance me for 6 years. Wow there bro. I came to Mattress Express and got my Sealy Posturpedic with this power base for cheaper than just the mattress was priced. Now I'm able to watch tv in my room and it's pretty awesome. Amrit is a nice guy and he has been doing this for a long time. He had a little bit too much info. I would recommend going a little less on the specs you already have a great price man!!</Text>

Came to Mattress Express Roseville looking  for a mattress for my nephew, Kameron, who was recently diagnosed with Lymphoma cancer. The owner, Amrit, wanted to show his support and donated  the mattress and coverings to prevent Kameron from outside germs, etc.  I cannot tell you enough how grateful the family and I are to such a caring and wonderful individual. Please solicit your business at Mattress Express Roseville and spread the word in thanks to our little buddy, Kameron!  God Bless!!< /text>

Lies about credit checks - they said they don’t do them, but they took all of my mom’s information and consistently said “we will not run your credit” but they did. They also lied about the payment plan and shortened it to 2 months rather than 3, then charged interest when they said it was interest free for the first three months.<//Review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) DO NOT BUY HERE! It seems that they offer you help but it is not. If you are looking for something cheap, stay away, they are scammers and will take your money. They promote a price and when signing a contract it is another price. Their customer service is bad, I took my furniture to return still packed the next day and they did not accept it. I write this to warn you, not to put anyone down.

(Original)
NO COMPRE AQUÍ! Pareciera que le ofreceran ayuda pero no es así. Si busca algo barato, alejese, son unos estafadores y tomaran su dinero. Promocionan un precio y al firmar contrato es otro precio. Su sercicio al cliente es malo, llevé mi mueble a devolver todavía empaquetado al siguiente día y no lo aceptaron. Escribo ésto para advertirle a usted, no para poner el mal a nadie.< /review>
