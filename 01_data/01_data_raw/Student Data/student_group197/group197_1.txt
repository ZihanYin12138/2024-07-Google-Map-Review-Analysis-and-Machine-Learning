Never shop at goodwill! It's a bogus charity and the CEO makes like 200,000 a year. Rescue mission thrift proceeds go back to the shelter and their staff is volunteer or paid very modestly . Prices are a steal and it's big so there's lots to choose from! It's my favorite thrift store of all time<//text>

Huge store that I frequent 1or 2 times a month - not only is the clothing sorted by size, they racks & racks, for men, women, & children. Then there is household & kitchen needs, electronics, decor, bedding, curtains, and lots of furniture. Staff is fast & thorough. It just a great store for everyone<//Text>

Nice selection of kitchen ware:dishes, cups.. on a good day you can find something awesome in the furniture and electronic section. Bought two chairs and all my plates and bowls here as well as small things for my house : cleaning rags, bed spreads, uniform/work pants.< /Text>

<text>I've never shopped there myself but I do donate a lot of my clothings that are almost always brand new never worn or worn once or twice only then it gets donated. I would recommend checking them out before shopping elsewhere to see if they have anything you would want or need at affordable prices. Plus you are practically helping the rescue mission do the work they do.</text>< date>

Great selection of stuff, terribly cluttered and they ask nearly full or new price. Many items I found were priced at exactly what the items sold for on ebay. Greedy< /review>

<Text>The manager has asked to search me and my bag like all 7 times I have gone in there, now I understand we live in eurtweeka so the first 6 times I said yes, making a bit of a stink the last 2 times. U have had some health issues and therefore my weight has been fluctuating. Right now it is n a gain weight phase, do needless to say I have to try on a few different sizes every time I go in. Twice now he had told me not to come back to the store literally because I tried stuff on and bought nothing!?! Even though I neatly hung all of the clothing back where it went and talerated very nicely his need to search my purse(an illegal request I might add).
I have NEVER  felt so disrespected as I have in this establishment! The manager is rude and stuck up and looks down. His nose at those less fortunate.They are not willing to help those who need help and just want the money. One of my aquatences was soaking wet one day from a trewrentchle down poor. Rather then be dishonest and steal dry clothes, they decided to ask the manager for some dry clothing. The manager, Allen I believe is his name, refused said friend any of the "donations to people left to help those less fortunate"!!! I was appalled!!!!! Later that afternoon I over heard him talking about the nice digital camera somebody had donated that had made a perfect b-day present for his granddaughter, and how he LOVES his beand new hybrid vehicle!!!

This business disgust me and is EXACTLY what's wrong with our society today!<//Text>< GmapID>

The best massage I've ever had.  Raquel was fantastic. I highly recommend her. She had great attention to detail and was kind enough to work longer on my back and knee.  If I go back, I'm asking for her.  Some of the amenities were closed due to COVID but regardless the massage was worth the money.< /Text>

I was concerned about the close contact going to a hands on & close spa day. But everyone practices strict protocol  during this difficult time. What a treat to spend the day letting all your troubles melt away in.</Review>

A magical experience from the start. A heavenly bathrobe with a delicious tea awaiting you. A relaxing pool to wash your premonitions away. A sauna to wash sweat away all of your stresses and feelings. A place to remind of your self and love for yourself. A facial to cleanse your self of toxins. To cap it off, a massage to bring you to nirvana. Unfortunately at the end, a bell was rung to bring you back to this world. A bell you need to hear more often. Take
Me to the spa, where I belong.<//review>

<review>Highly recommend! I had a great massage w/ Chrystal, and our Signature Bathing Ritual for 2 was perfect as well. The tubs were outside in a cute little private rooftop area, and they provided bath salts, fruit, and complimentary champagne. The staff was very friendly and professional. Wonderful experience!<//review>< pictures>

The staff is top tier, very friendly and professional. The place is beautifully designed and well maintained. It's super expensive though, I've found a spa that offers more services for a lower price. However the quality of services offered here is quite exceptional (: I would definitely recommend this spa to a friend.<//Review>

<text>This is my favorite spa. They have great amenities here. Expect to spend at least a couple of hours here pampering yourself. I love this spa for many reasons. There's a hot tub, a cool misting room, steam sauna, dry sauna, wonderful showers with all the accoutrements you can think of such as aromatherapy towels, fresh cut cucumbers for your eyes , fruits and teas and the service is always excellent.</text>< date>

<Time>1544042388155< /Time><rate>4< /rate><review>I have a membership so I go here about once a month for their Nourishing facial and to use their amenities. Most of their estheticians are quite good, as well as their H2V product line used in conjunction with Eminence products. I have extremely sensitive skin and since coming here, I rarely need to put on skin makeup because it is so clear now. The only area for improvement is the occasional noise level by other patrons in the jacuzzi area (the situation needs to be managed better) and the volume of the music in the Quiet Room (oftentimes it is too loud).< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>My first time visiting Burke Williams and I can honestly say i enjoyed my experience. I felt like I glided out of there after my massage and had such a good sleep that night. The spa is clean and the staff is helpful and they show you where everything is. I took advantage of the amenities before getting my massage to set the tone. I would highly recommend everyone do so before getting your massage.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I live in rural Colorado and come home to visit my family every couple of months. I always receive a Burke Williams gift certificate for my birthday the day after Christmas and it has become such a treat for me to pamper myself right before the start of a new year. I recently visited and had a wonderful facial from Natasha. The ambience is always lovely inside and I can spend all day soaking, steaming, resting and reading. The ladies behind the front desk are always helpful and I am so happy that it's so close to my parent's house in Mission Viejo. It's one of the highlights of my time spent at home in CA.</review>

I got a gift cards from here in may and try to use in feburary and it was expired.  Manager at the mission Viejo said no and could not help me.I  called corporate office in Crompton and transfer me around and no response.
This is second time I had an issue with gift cards.  DO NOT BUY BURKS WILLIAMS GIFT CARD.< /Review>

Everything is just five star. I have had facials, massages, body scrub and every time, they exceeded my expectations.< /review>

It was short (43 Minutes) and as it is they over charge for 50 minutes massage.
This was my birthday gift and I am very unhappy with the time and the massage that felt like someone is rubbing oil over my body which I think does not justify $120.00!!
Very very disappointed. Would not recommend.<//Text>

My experience with Burk Williams has been nothing but poor trying to make a reservation as a member you don't get any additional priorities over Father's Day weekend they didn't have lockers available trying to speak to a manager or someone of any authority there is useless I am  i'm  terminating my membership after being with them for over two years<//Text>

This Forever 21 is so big that it has men's clothes. I didn't even know Forever 21 sold men's clothes so this was completely confusing to me. So this must be a really good Forever 21. Also it didn't look like it had been ransacked by teenage girl mongols, which is rare when you step into one of these stores.</Review>

Polite employers make your shopping easier and happiest.
Great choice of quality apparel.
Hopefully that department for men will be bigger as soon as possible.<//text>

<review>Located on the main street which is very pleasant promenade. The shop is full of atmosphere, nice local staff. Often, usually thursday the prices are cut off.

I like your store but please, please, clean your windows!!! I walk by the soquel ave side often, looking in the windows to see whats new and am grossed out by the splatters covering the glass ruining any display set behind them. As a big chain, I imagine you can afford a window washer...<//Text>

Not many options for men's clothes. And they are definitely not for anyone with an average size bottom.< /Review>

<review>So Did you know that forever 21 pays the people who make the clothing items 3.25 per hour? So that means they get paid 25 dollars 8 hours. And they get mistreated and the boss  of them always spits on them when someone gets fired, if you think this is a fake comment, ask someone who is a imigrant who works there...... THIS IS WHY I HATE FOREVER 21<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Feels great when you pop in once a month or so and Jasmine remembers your order . Them not knowing I’m on a time crunch, my drink is ready in less than 5 m. Truly appreciate that girls! Great place to go if you’re in a rush.< /text>

This is an amazing Starbucks! I have no idea what the difference is but for whatever reason it's a lot less busy than other Starbucks in the area and the service seems to be so much faster. There's a lot of seating and outdoor seating. They keep the place very clean and tidy. I will definitely be back!< /Text>

<review>I come here whenever I go see my physician down the street and boy do they get it right! Always with the smiles and reccomendations. I had banana nut bread last week and they heated it up to just the right temp despite blazing hot weather outside. Definitely leave with a smile every time! Enter westbound on Olympic past Fairfax then make a right before Shakey's.

<Review>This is probably my least favorite Starbucks location. There are no outlets here to work, even though there are so many tables. Additionally, they added whipped cream without asking, coffees were so hot my tongue needs a skin graph and the whipped cream was overflowing the lid and was filthy. They didn’t even call our name to say the drinks were ready. The chai latte was not too sweet, so that was a plus.

Staff here was very friendly.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnj0LAmOu3nBZjItp4S4Ano3VU5MhAtMlbRdm5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<rating>4</rating><review>this is a commentary on the disgusting things people do outside of this Starbucks and many others around Los Angeles. How can people purchase their drinks and food...then walk outside and literally toss their empty drink cups and food containers right on to the parking lot because they're too lazy to get out of their cars and toss them in the trash bin...WHICH IS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM. this is what these people are teaching their kids and young adults...that when you have money and a fancy SUV or vehicle and you live I a nice house in Beverly hills..you can do this. I don't blame the Starbucks staff..but there has to be a,way to stop this shameful and disgusting behavior. It's absolutely appalling what these rich, entitled people do and get away with.< /review><userid>111763666769211328886<//userid>< Response>

<Review>There's a large table for a group of 10.  And no one rushes you out, even tho I've been there meeting with students for 3, 4 hours. Good fast service  I see constant cleaning. There is dedicated parking though it's sometimes a challenge to get out of parking lot due to odd configuration...and congestion off Fairfax<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>The entire staff at this location is wonderful but I was especially grateful for Julio today. He is the best! I asked for some water with my order and he asked about size preference which is kind of a big deal because usually you don't get to choose. He was so kind about my request and gave me a 30z cup. I am a delivery driver and drive all day. So this meant a lot to me. Now I'll have a huge cup of water for my runs. ❤️</review><resp>None</resp><user_id>106643431743200035317</user_id>< date>

Love this Starbucks. They always have a good variety and very healthy vibe. What I mean in particular is the staff's friendliness and readiness to help. All of the guys there have a sense of humor, love their clients, very patient and always help you to navigate the menu and make the best choice! Today  I want to thank Jarrod and Markisha. Guys, you are the best. Thank you for the assistance and the yummiest lunch:)!❤️🌸<//Review>

The mobile orders and customers who order multiple drinks/food routinely overburden 98% of Starbucks as 98% of the staff are trainees.  There is usually just one person taking orders and often 30 customers in a short time.   Clearly Starbucks interest is greed over quality service!

Anyone who shows quality service & good coffee can take over the industry.  Unless dirty politics intervene< /Text>

This was the worst Starbuck experience I've ever had. The line was out the door and the people were in the back laughing and joking. When I asked a person who walked from the back they said "I'm off." The two workers that were working their butts off where cool.The parking was terrible.  I will never stop here again.</review>

< Review>
Server (cailey) initially got order wrong, charging me for 2 drinks rather than a flavor pump in one drink.  Corrected right away.  Also asked if order was ok.  When I admitted I didn't like the flavor pump after tasting it, cailey quickly made me another one.  Kudos to cailey for great service.<//Review>

Parking was fine, service was great, but they have removed all charging wall outlets so the place is empty and not a great place to stay for long.</Review>

<Text>This used to be my favorite Starbucks in the area, but on a recent trip I've discovered that they've removed all of their outlets. This makes plugging in a computer to do some work while you sit your overpriced latte impossible. I have no idea why they've done this -- it's clear that plugging at Starbucks is a huge reason many people visit -- but I will sadly not be visiting this location again.<//Text>< Pictures>

First time here, went in on a weeknight and there was enough seating, even some outlet plugs on the side. There is a parking lot but many spots are only 20 minutes not sure if they are very particular. Like this spot.</Review>

This Starbucks wasn't good at all it didn't have the right equipment to make the espresso and they were out of pastries and out of breakfast sandwiches the service was friendly but whoever was in charge did not do their job and stock up the stores for the customer which was disappointing in on my lunch break to say the least< /Text>

Over the last 6 years of dealing with their monopoly on Chico waste disposal I have never been satisfied and more often than not felt overcharged, underserved and upset with their service. If the lid on my dumpster is open even an inch they charge me a $42 service fee, yet when  a carboard box gets wedged in the middle of the recycling dumpster they get our of the truck, take a picture of it and then get back in the truck and drive away leaving me with a 2/3 full dumpster and then will not come back to get the rest of it without charging me for the extra pick up. I pay them $450 a month for service. This is unreal. They are a monopoly with no desire to help their customers that have no other option. Please Chico City Council change this terrible policy of giving the waste disposal companies a monopoly. I would do anything to have Recology pick up my trash like they used to years ago.<//Review><rate>1</rate>< Resp>

Terrible service, their payment system is horrible, regularly not processing my auto pay. They shut down my service without notice after I payed. The only good thing about this place was the customer service rep that helped me. Don't use them if you can avoid it.<//review>

Truck drivers find any excuse not to pick your trash up. If you can avoid this business, I would recommend you do so. One star business and the only option in Chico.< /Review>

My husband called on Friday they said they would be out either that day or by the end of the day Monday. On Monday they drove right by again and did not pick up our trashcan which had been out since Sunday night. My husband called the office again and she said he came out at 8:45 this morning at which point my husband said our full can of trash is still sitting out in front of our house.  She said she would call the driver and get it picked up. Now it's Tuesday and it has not been picked up. Terrible service.< /review><user_id>117316916717915368248< /user_id>< resp>

I am writing here just because I really believe the city of Chico should provide compost bins for waste management. I am a college student who is very environmentally conscientious, and aware of the pollutants food produces from being thrown in the trash, instead of being composted. I would love to see a compost service begun in Chico.<//text>

<review>Waste Management hit and totaled my husband's car. It took them over a week to set up and several phone calls for him to have a rental while his car was being set up for an estimate. 2 weeks later they said "sorry the estimate is more than the car is worth. You'll need to return the rental we will pay the title off."

A week since then and they just keep saying "we are working on it." No time frames and we have to keep making payments for a car that isn't drivable. And they refuse to pay for anymore rental since the car THEY TOTALED cannot be fixed. Crooks is what they are, and I wish we had a different choice in service.</review>< GmapID>

<text>I simply ordered, paid for and have been waiting for a larger trash can for 6 weeks, it would be nice to have but not a necessity. Each week I'm told it will be there Friday and doesn't come.  Two weeks ago WM took away my current smaller can along with my recycling and yard waste cans which were fine.  Now we have had no cans of any kind for two weeks but keep getting told they will be there next Friday.  This is a joke, if you have inventory issues, also what they told us on the phone, why would you have taken my current cans prior to having my new cans in?  Bring back my old cans if you have nothing else, I know you know where I live you sent me the bill.</text>< UserId.>

<review>I have been waiting for a recycle can since MAY!!  I have called every week since June 10th to ask for a recycle can.  Every week they have told me that I'll receive the recycle can on Thursday, our regular pick up day...and EVERY Thursday they have not delivered a recycle can. Every Thursday.  Last week the truck, with at least 15 recycle cans on it , went right by our place.  I called...they said they'd call me back, they didn't.  No can, no call.
I have NO other problems...<//review></record>

I signed up for waste service 3 months ago. In the span of the past 3 months, my garbage has not been collected 4/12 times. I also have not had a green waste bin delivered; however, I'm still paying for it. I make sure I follow the rules: the lids close, cans are out the night before, etc. The service is expensive, and it is just a waste of money at this point.<//text>

<Review>My roommate and I have been waiting for our garbage and recycling cans for 6 whole weeks now. We’ve called every week, and every week they say, “your cans will arrive next Monday.” Last time my roommate called while I was at work, she called on her lunch break and the whole just rang for 20 minutes before she had to go back to work. The second time she called the line was just dead. This is a terrible company. And we’re being charged this whole time.< /Review>< Name>

I've been requesting an additional green waste container for over a month. Every week I am advised that one will arrive the following week. This morning I spoke to a supervisor who said there were "no expectations when an additional green waste container would be available".  I asked why I had been lied to every week for a month.  She denied my accusation, yet said that her staff will continue telling me to expect a container the following week.  This is dishonest and unprofessional.<//Text>

Terrible service.  Called them to bring out a dumpster for construction debris.  All seemed well until they came to pick it up.  They refused to pick it up.  I talked to them three times doing everything that they said to do so that they could pick it up.  Even going over it with their customer service person step by step. Still refused to pick it up. That's when they decided to tell me that stucco is a different type of construction debris and that i would have to empty half of it out.  They also waited until then to let me know that they have the same size dumpster for that type of debris.  This would have been helpful to know in the beginning.  They say the phone calls are recorded so they must be able to hear me telling them that i needed a heavy dumpster in the first place.  Very unprofessional and unorganized.  wasted too many man hours and too much money for nothing.  I am still left with the debris and they offered no other solution.  i will be going elsewhere for my personal and my companies needs.  I could have rented a truck and hauled it away my self for the money and man hours i spent.  Would have given no stars< /Text>

<review>How do you give a rating less than 1 star? Not that it matters, since i cannot choose another service.

So for multiple weeks in a row (this time, and not uncommon many single occasions in the past) my cans were not emptied properly. This has happened with garbage, recycle and green waste. When after two weeks of not getting my green waste can emptied, I had a large pile of green waste building up to which I had to take to the dump myself. I called in prior to let them know I needed the driver to make a trip to empty my can so I could put more into from the ground, and was told they couldn't. I asked for a manager to call me back, and after a week with no callback, I took the green waste in myself. This cost me time, money to drop the load, fuel for the truck I borrowed, and then more time to pressure wash the driveway (now is stained) from the rotting green waste pile that should have been able to fit inside my can had it been emptied. I wrote in and complained about not having anyone call me back, as I had requested and told would happen from the phone rep. I said I felt i should be compensated for the said time fuel etc. They just responded by saying " the driver cannot shake the can and Ill have to make sure it doesn't get stuck in there" and essentially to deal with my own problems. Literally just got another follow up email from them saying that I am responsible for the waste to not be "jammed" in the can and that gravity cannot do its job to empty the can. To this, I ask how did I get a bunch of grass clippings "jammed" in the can? Maybe gravity doesnt get a chance to work because the cans are not held upside down for more than a split second. I mean, I can make water stay in an open bucket while upside down, but doesn't mean I "jammed" the water in there so that gravity didn't give it a chance to fall out. Double F this company, not only was I forced into their service but their customer service responses have been feeling pretty condescending...</review>< Pictures>

THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE...Does anyone even work there? The answer is yes, but only in the billing department because my bill is always on time. I was on hold for over an hour, mainly because I wanted to see how long they would leave me there. I finally gave up after an hour.

I have called and opened two different "tickets"..was told they would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours, and in both cases did not hear back. I am now on some eternal hold AGAIN trying to get through to someone to help with this issue. I sure wish there was another service to choose as I would certainly do so.

Wait time for Commercial Dumpster 30-40 minutes Ouch!  There's no direct phone line to Commercial you have to wait 15 - 20 minutes to reach residential then they transfer you commercial.  We are a construction company that rents dumpsters all over California, I cringe every time we have to use Wast Management because it will take hours of hold time to manage one dumpster.  I hate having to call them about a $5 bill that should have been handled the last time I called.  Ridiculous!  FYI I started typing this while on hold... still holding< /text>

I live where the road bends so there is less parking and smaller area to put my garbage cans. I put the cans further out in the road to make it easier for the garbage truck driver to pick up my cans. I have still had the driver not pick up my can, drop my can at the neighbors house, or not get all the garbage out of the can. I wish we had Recology back. They have friendlier drivers and much better customer support. Also, I just read that WM is now going to charge an additional $7.10 charge if your can lid is not completely closed.</text>

Embarrassing excuse for a business. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, COMMUNICATION, INTEGRITY. Never been one good experience except that they take my garbage. But that's their job. Took my bins because of system "error" then took weeks to resolve. Run the company like high school drop out, 14 year olds. Whiny management and really, authentically, don't give 2 sh1ts about the customers. Also their departments communicate using ancient technology  because every damn time I have an issue, its "their system". Take responsibility and SERVE your customers. I wouldn't reccomend them to my worst enemy. Avoid at all cosys.<//Text>

Gee, I miss Recology.  Zero stars if possible. My bills from WM do not have a due date, it simply says "due upon receipt".  So then I am charged a late fee AND a "resume service" fee when service never stopped! What is late? How am I supposed to know?!  Their online bill pay system is convoluted as well. Why do residential customers need invoice numbers? And their website was down for days, making it difficult to pay the bill. Plus, they have never replaced my recycling can from Recology. Gee, I miss Recology.</text>

Autopay is not great. My bank account was low when they tried to charge me in march and it didn't go through. I had plenty of funds a few days later, but they didn't try to charge me again, and only sent one email that it didn't go through. Annoying considering I missed this email since it is not a monthly payment (it is quarterly) and the single email slipped through the cracks.

Alas, 3 months later I saw the trash truck skip my house one day and the driver told me service was suspended for my address.

I never received a phone call, piece of mail or email explicitly stating service was suspended, I had to go on their website to see this was the case. Annoying considering I was attempting to leave for the summer. I guess the trash can rot.< /Text><Name>Alex Henderson< /Name><rating>2<//rating><user>106300193745406284318< /user></record></dataset><record>

We had relocated to Chico after the Camp Fire. When we set up our service here we were suppose to get two recycling bins but when the bins showed up we were only given one and it is so old the lid does not fit well so we have to keep it in our garage so it does not fill with water when it rains. We now live on a very busy public street. We do not park in front of our home and cannot prevent other from parking in front of our house on garbage day. When I called to see why my garbage was not picked up I was sent a picture with someone else’s car in front of our can and told the can was obstructed. They will not come and get my can but will charge me $27 dollars to come pick it up sometime next week. It is in the 80’s this week, my garbage already gets picked up on Tuesdays so how is that helpful? It was suggested that I could drive it to the dump myself or ask a neighbor to use theirs. Very helpful seeing that is was a neighbor who parked in front of my can in the first place. We had them in Magalia too, no choice, and do you know that they only picked up the green waste and recycling every other week. Most people were forced to put green waste in their garbage cans and pile up leaves until their green waste was emptied every other week. Not sure piles of dry leaves were helpful in preventing wild fires.</text>

This is the worst organization. I have called 4 times to resolve a billing issue. Each rep has told me they are taking care of it. Yet, after 3 months I still have not received my refund. They are quick to bill you; but far less than efficient in paying you back when you have a credit. I don't understand "customer no-service at all". Zero stars should be an option. I hope the City of Chico looks at these reviews as their vendor of choice is awful!!< /Text>

AWFUL AWFUL SERVICE!! These people are not up to the task and they should all be replaced! They have been billing me for recycling for 6 months now but the recyling dept called me to say they don't offer that service to me! I have called 5 times and they don't get it!!  What's not to get? I have to get an attorney?  RIDICULOUS.
Got a response to share my problems again. Sent it again yesterday........still have not heard back.  WM Cares??????</review>

<Review>When I lost my credit card, I immediately updated my autopay credit card info (correctly) with the replacement card online. Guess what? A few months later, no trash service for missing payment...I went online, hit the Pay Now button with the card that was already on file and wouldn't you know it, it worked...I assume that sometime between losing my card and updating my payment information with the new card,  they ran my lost card and was declined. So what is the point of updating autopay credit card information if they don't actually use it after it is updated?<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This company is horrible!! I'm  strictly referring to the BILLING OFFICE & MANAGEMENT!! The drivers are fine. Ever since they took over from Recology in Chico it's  been a hot mess. I've  had to call & have them straighten out the bill. I don't  have the luxury of speaking to someone  in Chico..they're in Arizona or NM. EVERY SINGLE TIME I  get my bill it's  wrong!! They consistently OVERCHARGE me (probably thinking I  won't  notice). Idiots. Thanks city council, for screwing up my garbage service which was just fine.😡😡😡<//text>

I had nothing but problems with this company over a decade ago.  When forced by the City of Chico to use Waste Management instead of the company I was using, Recology, I was disappointed but thought I would give WM the benefit of the doubt in hopes their service improved.  IT HAS NOT!  My trash pick up has been skipped multiple times, my payment posted to the wrong account, my account suspended, and accusation that I'm not putting my can out.  I have to prove to WM that I'm making my payments.  We live on a busy street, and my trash over flows onto the road because they will not come pick it up when I call.  I am informed that I can wait until my next service day.  I might as well not have a can and put it on the side of the road!  The recycling and green waste however, are picked up weekly! Terribly disappointed in their service and the City of Chico has eliminated our rights to choose!<//Review>

<Text>I was told last week that our cans would be delivered. I’ve been given the runaround over the last three calls to this company. They are super friendly on the phone, but there’s no actual follow through with their promises of delivering cans. I have an infant so it’s not easy to drive my trash around to throw it away in my family’s cans! Meanwhile ants are moving into the garage of our brand new home. I’m REALLY frustrated with WM.</Text>< Name>

< Review>
3 Weeks trying to get my trash can replaced!!! The claw pick up crushed in 1/2 ! after 2 weeks of it being broken it finally got stuck on the claw and into the  truck it went with a promise from the driver that a new one would be right out!  2 Weeks later & after 2 + hours of calls to Ariz.( The Co.Call Center) They say there still waiting on a response from their e-mails to Chico dispatch! They say the can not call Chico, Calif. directly. Even when it's been weeks of mistakes and no responses???? Are you serious! Like others reported once the big business wins the city contract there is no longer any recourse or customer service! While waiting for the call center who promised they would call me when the had an idea when the next delivery would be, the can was delivered? No call?
Unbelievable!</Review>

Poor service, period. Dealt with a closed account, and paid bill for 9 months. About every 2-3 months I start getting calls about an account closed last year. I deal with it for the better part of a month and then a few months later it starts again. Service is unorganized, they charged me at my new address but took 5 weeks to deliver the cans.

For larger than average recycling runs North Valley Waste Management is great. Just back your truck up and start loading the the appropriate dumpsters. The downside is that their hours of operation suck. M-F 10-4 so don't plan on getting your recycling done on the weekend or before work or after work. You are pretty much stuck with using your lunch break.</review>

they have been charging me for a green waste can. I have been here in the same house for over 10 years. I have never wanted a green waste can and made that quite clear to them from the very start. We dispose of our green waste ourselves. We have always done this. I looked at my bill and they have been charging me for it! I called and asked to have my account credited back and their response to me was " we will mail you a letter/form to fill out then send it back to us" so very frustrated.</Review>

<Review>$150 penalty for each time our garbage bags are exposed above dumpster edge. Our trash is not spilling over the sides, or a precariously stacked pile of loose debris sticking out everywhere. No toxic waste. No couches, cinder blocks, TV's. Just food and paper, sealed and closed in clear garbage bags. The bags simply formed a round hill that was 24" or so above the rim level. Makes sense - driver didn't have to do a single thing differently - $150. Commercial businesses beware, especially if they are exposed at night and someone fills your dumpster the night before a pick up.  No mercy here.< /Review>< pics>

The worst service I've ever experienced.  You'd think they were a monopoly the way they treat their customers (oh wait, they are! Thanks Chico)

They make changes to your account without your permission (dropping green waste coverage?), change days without notifying you, and every other week seem to miss their pick up. When you call they pretend everything is your fault and try to charge extra to come back out to fix their mistakes.<//Text>
</record>
</dataset><record>
<text>If you are a business, beware.  They put you on an automatic renewal where you cannot cancel.
They are slow to fix problems.
They charge double the price for business, which makes no sense except they lack integrity.
Our advise- take your trash home!< /text>< user_name>

< Review>
Waste Management is very rude and lacking in service to its customers.   After several phone calls and 4 weeks of trash piling up after one of WM drivers took away our garbage bin stating that we do not have an open account with them, I finally was able to speak with a supervisor who admitted they were in error after I produced Invoices to the contrary.  We in fact had (and have) a long standing contract with them.  Still no apology or attempt to rectify was offered, and I had to insist on having a new bin delivered ASAP.< /Review>

<Text>I had WM in early 1990 and when i moved they told me to leave cans on street, then they charged me 400.00 for them, they told me they did not receive them !! They were rude and would not listen!! I switched to recology (which was cheaper) and they are outstanding!! Now the city decided to monopolize trash service in chico. I'm forced to use this company now, they picked up my recology cans and didn't drop new cans. I've called 3 times and still no cans!! Also they don't except most recycle!! What the heck?? Basically only basic recycle they take, if you put for instance Styrofoam tray with recycle logo they will charge you!! Ridiculous! Oh and the last call to get new cans they end the call with "Thank you for being a Waste Management customer" Like I have a choice!!!!<//Text>< user_id>

Have had WM service for 2 years in Chico and the driver has drove past my bins roadside now 4times. After the first two times I put up security cameras and caught the driver skipping me . This last time Last week I had recently moved out of town and left the trash out on Monday night for a Thursday pick up. And the driver left it! I will be calling the management Monday to explain the problem!<//review>

I was forced to switch to waste management about six months ago and I used Recology before and I really like their service. Today the driver didn't like that I had my bin overflowing and wrote in permanent marker for me not to overfill the dumpster. Who does That?  They also spilled garbage and didn't clean it up nor did they take the extra box I had sitting out.  Recology always took the extra boxes.   😡👎🏽< /text>

<Review>I have been with this company for the past 10 years. I guess it's time to switch to Recology. On April 7 of this year the driver who picked up our garbage brought the mechanical arm with the garbage can  attached to it down on my son's portable basketball hoop. When I called to report it the very same day management came out and took pictures. After a long drawn out bunch of failed phone calls to their insurance company to file a claim,I was told that there wasn't anything they could do for me and I'd I wanted to fight it I could get an attorney. ...what the Hell!!?? All I wanted was for them to correct the problem. I guess in big business now a days the customer isn't always right. It's a shame..customer satisfaction is key to business. If one customer tells one customer and so on it will eventually affect the business. So my son goes without his hoop. ..Thanks for nothing. Hello Recology!

Update on my service. ...just switched to Recology this morning! Good riddance Waste Management, we had a long run of using your services. But do to your lack of concern for your driver severely damaging my son's basketball hoop my family and I are out of here! Not even so much as an offer to credit my account to rectify the situation. I will make sure to tell friends and family of your horrible service.< /Review>< pics>

I would give you a -5 if I could because you never send a bill and then shut down service when the bill is not paid.  Get new office help or just give up.  Your service is terribly customer unfriendly!!<//Review>

My neighbors and I are using WM green bags, the truck drivers are to lazy to get out of their trucks and walk to our driveways to pick up our bags.  They can't even figure out that there are empty containers that they can use so they don't have to carry the bags.  We are old ladies and they want us to carry the bags to the end of our driveways.  This is one of the worse businesses in Chico.< /review>

No stars if possible. I have called 3x to get a 96g switched to a 64g and they bring me another 96g. So I call again to get both 96g picked up...result never got picked up. Also our yard waste container is always skipped. I have had waste management for 1 month and the service has been a joke.< /review>

I wish this company hadn't been forced on me by our Butte Co. Board of Supervisors.  There's a reason I stopped using them before . . . their service is marginal.  Often time they just drive by and forget to stop.  You can't get thru on the phone and when you do it's in another state.<//text>

< Review>
This was an..interesting experience. I ordered online for pickup at 6. Online site works well and is easy to follow. I get there 15 minutes earlier than expected, but figured I would see if my food was done. I walked in and it was finished, so I grabbed it and went. Got home, unpacked everything and was missing as roll. I called and the whole phone conversation was stressful. A lot of back and forth since she kept interrupting me, then gave the phone to someone else. I thought she understood that they forgot part of my order, but when my husband came back he said they made him pay for it. I know language barrier can be really frustrating for both sides, but I feel like of they slowed down and let me talk they would have understood what was wrong. The sushi was ok, the ramen bland. I probably would have gone back if the communication wasn't such a hassle, but I don't think I will.<//Review>

Very nice people but it’s a little bit slow service.  I didn’t like rolls, it’s kind of you trynna do at home by yourself, and ramen is good, but not perfect. I wish you’ll do better, guys.<//text>< Pictures>

This place is run by Chinese people who don't make good sushi or Ramen.  First the sushi had too much vinegar added to the rice, it was actually tart.  The ramen middles were smushie, the broth bland.  I ordered the slow cooked pork belly, the pork was chewy not tender.  My kids got the bento box.  It wasn't a bento box and there was very little food for $15, no miso soup, no salad other than the lettuce under their teriyaki salmon.  I definitely won't go back.</Text>

Probably the worst ramen I've had. I had the roasted duck ramen. The meat was SUPER salty and the worst pieces of the duck. I kept getting small pieces of bone in my mouth. 0.1% seaweed, 0.1% corn(???), 0.2% tofu, 95% ramen and 5% duck.</Review>

<Time>1534122157872</Time><Response>None<//Response><rating>1< /rating><text>This was one of the oddest dining experiences of my life. The food is passable, but not great by any means. The service could really use some improvement. The atmosphere between the owner(?) and employees was downright awkward and there was no priority put on the comfort of the customer. We heard multiple squabbles between employees within ten feet of our table and employees showed no awareness to customers--literally talking about or referencing us like we could not hear. We were asked multiple times what we ordered by the waitress even though we literally gave her a menu with our selections circled, lol. One of the best parts was when the waitress would sit at her little table by the back and yell across the room to different tables: "do you want your check?" A girl came in and sat down and she yelled across the room, "Hun, do you want a water?" A truly hilarious and strange moment, but incredibly awkward to experience first-hand. It sounds like this place is a solid option for late-night sushi and I can see how that would make sense. My one-star review is only meant to inform--I'm sure I didn't experience Jika at its best--but if this saves someone else from an incredibly awkward and unsatisfactory in-person dining experience, then it has done it's job.< /text>< userid>

<Text>Apparently this place is more about delivery than eat-in. Or at least, that was our impression upon our first visit here.
It was 9-ish and a friend and I were strolling the street, we were worried most restaurants would have been closed by that time. So seeing this one advertised to be opened until 1am, we were very glad. Plus, they seemed to have glowing reviews.

The food was okay. Nothing of particular good or bad. A three star experience I'd say.
Not sure if because we ate at 9:30pm so it made that difference.
But what bothered us was the waitress' attitude. She made it rather obvious that she wanted us out of the restaurant as soon as possible, making several trips asking if we were done.
Well I'm sorry that we were not aware maybe the kitchen was understaffed by that time, but your restaurant clearly advertised it to be still open.

A rather disappointing experience, especially with service.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

It was a good late night stop. Not the best, but at midnight definitely not the worst I've had. Ramen was good, rolls were great and the tempura was crispy! Good job!<//review>

<user_name>Sonja Montgomery< /user_name><Resp>None<//Resp><Rate>2</Rate><review>Food was fine. I've only eaten here once, so I'm willing to believe it could be better (or worse).  The service was not great. The waitress appeared to make no effort at all to learn Japanese dish names. On the one hand, the waitress had some great instincts, but on the other hand acted pretty strange--forgetting our order, talking to the chef in a way that I thought was disrespectful, asking me what I ordered so she could correctly bill me. Also, the restaurant should have been cleaner. Maybe I'd be shocked by most industrial kitchens, but we're all in the same room here, and it would be great if I could leave confident that I would not get food poisoning. While I would not recommend to a friend, if you're hungry and need a spot close by, you'll get food to fill you up.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Walked in the door and stood at the printing queue.
The Employee behind the desk yells, “What Do You Need?!” Eyes still locked on his screen.

Immediately I felt like an inconvenience.

I mentioned that usually people say hello.

He didn’t take that well so he asked me to step aside 3 times while he helped out 4 other costumers who came in after me.

A family who needed passport photos, a girl who was printing out a graph and a few shipments.

It was straight out of Seinfeld... “No prints for you!”

There was a brand new employee who tried to help me out but she wasn’t familiar with the software yet.

So I waited for 20 minutes until the Manager got there.  It took the manager all of 2 minutes to figure out how to print out my flyers and get me on my way.

I read some other reviews and I guess I’m not alone on this one.  The costumer service here is lacking.

However some people who work there are amazing and go above and beyond to make sure your prints are perfect.  That’s why I added a star.  It’s just really hit or miss and depends on who you get.

Come on Fed Ex Kinkos of Marina Del Rey! You guys should be a 4 star establishment all you need is to make sure all of your employees know how to treat people with common courtesy.<//review>

<UserId.>109223133491331861160<//UserId.><username>Daniel Richards</username><Review>I had a really great experience at this location.  Shout out to Tyler who was the mastermind behind my creative project.  This location is open 24 hours and Tyler worked through the night to get it done and put a ton of heart and soul into it.  I know that sounds unbelievable but Tyler was really excited about my project and I left knowing that he understood how important it was to me.  He also helped me find the best price / method of executing it.  The rest of the team, Ronnia and Charnia and one other gentleman - a Dodger fan, whose name I never learned - were each instrumental in helping Tyler finish the job.  It was a very large job, almost $400 but I was happy with that price compared to what I had initially been quoted to pay.  I really appreciate this location, recommend it to anyone and will be back again soon.  Thank you Tyler, Charnia, Ronnie and the Dodger guy !< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Rudest people I've ever met in my life, wouldn't lift a finger to help an injured veteran yet somehow lightning fast to squeal about your mask slipping - tho half the employees weren't even wearing theirs correctly not ten feet away.

Root cause is obviously very poor management 💯 GFY<//Review>

Christin that’s working here is a star!!! I had to send a package and she took care of it for me super quick and easy. Such an amazing, friendly and professional woman. She gave me such a good impression I felt like I had to write a review. I wish I got that kind of service everywhere I went. Keep up the great work girl!!!! 🌟< /Review>

Update: Ronnie came back from lunch and printed my photos manually.  Thank you Ronnie, hope FedEx Corporate cam appreciate you as much as I do and get you machines that actually work!

The photo printing machines are absolutely garbage.  Don't waste your time here...been here 15 mins and nobody wants to help and machine is unresponsive.  This place is terrible!!!<//text>

Nice enough experience, a bit chaotic, but the employees were nice and helpful. However, I brought an important package for delivery and was promised it would be at its destination the next day in the afternoon. In fact, the package sat at this location until after the estimated delivery time, and arrived nearly 3 days after the guaranteed delivery time, completely ruining a major event we had put together. If customer service had taken any responsibility at all for this issue, I would not be writing this review. Do not count on FedEx if the package has to be there on time, or at least not this location.<//Review>

In the midst of a pandemic AND the holidays you'd expect a not so great customer experience, but that's not the case at this FedEx location in Marina Del Rey (on Maxella Ave). The team here is phenomenal - they are organized, helpful, efficient, and most importantly, they are kind.

They get how special it can be to send a friend a gift and they will help organize your package in a way that just opening the box will become an experience for the receiver. They get excited about what you bring in to copy or print because they know that it's something important to you.

There is a sense of community at this location that extends beyond the team and to the customers. Huge thanks to the Maxella Ave FedEx Team, you guys are rockstars!<//Text>

<text>I was at the Marina del Rey FEDEX on Maxella St. Store # 1015.Christin waited on me and explained everything clearly and succinctly. I am not used to sending anything FEDEX; however, it was an excellent experience especially since I was hesitant in regard to the process.<//text>< pics>

I'm not sure how he does it, but he responds almost immediately and made it out for an estimate right away.  They did amazing work, were clean and quick and professional!  We would highly recommend them to anyone.  In fact, we are having them come out to do more work and will be using them for our tree maintenance moving forward!< /Review>

<Review>I've been BLOWN AWAY by the quality of customer service at this location! Having an extremely detailed print job and needing it done same-day for a presentation was causing me anxiety to say the least. Christian walked me through my order, showed me options, even started from scratch when my boss changed details mid-order to handover a perfect, presentation ready booklet that impressed my superiors and in turn opened more doors for me within my work space. I can't thank Christian, the store manager, and the rest of the staff enough for taking the time and having the patience to deal with such a demanding job.< /Review>< pictures>

Cory was instrumental in helping with my project.

He actually cared about my order, was easy to speak with and was willing to go the extra mile to make sure it was done right.  Judging by all the negative reviews from other Google reviewers, I'm not sure that his kind of attitude or drive is appreciated/rewarded by corporate but it definitely should be!  Cory told me he was a self-learner and driven to help.  FedEx should promote this man, train their employees better, and hire others like him because they could learn a thing or two from this guy!</review>

This location always looks understaffed. There's always a wait no matter how many people are waiting or not. Usually when I come in to drop off a package, there is no one at the shipping desk.

Came in here yesterday to simply drop off a package (didn't ask for a receipt) and was told to wait by the girl working the register. Not sure why they don't just have a designated area for package drops... Makes no sense to wait in line if you don't need to deal with a person.<//text>

<review>I could already tell Gabriel was an excellent FedEx representative by watching him interact with the customer before me.  He is so patient, helpful and enjoyable to talk to. Incredibly positive and friendly. I was shipping a lot of my belongings for a temporary move. Gabriel packed everything for me and helped me understand how the pricing structure works for shipment. When we realized I could save $120 by shipping the items in cased,  Gabriel happily helped me unpack and repack them. We were also experiencing issues with the credit card processing and he was so patient.  I am at FedEx often and this was by far the best experience I've had.</review>< Date>

Left me on hold on the phone after not saying hello - for over 15 mins - was still on hold as I decided to drive over directly  - I saw three people on computers behind the counter - are they ignoring customers in line? Wait there is no “designated line “ just lots of self check out computers at the  - can’t believe a few of us were after waiting 25mins - I know?! What the were we waiting for?? recommend NOT bothering with this place - despite it being only 8pm - God I  hate to see what it’s like at peak hours (half a star rating) if I needed a xerox copy I could do it myself - but needed to send a non-standard package</Review>

Do yourself a favor. Look inside. If there is only one other customer, give it a try. Otherwise, run. Run far and fast. Anywhere else. Most printers don’t function properly, and employees can’t keep up with demand. Actually, new rule, just don’t go. That’s a better plan.</text>

Met with a very unprofessional and discriminative FedEx employee. He found a way to turn me away with a document that didn't actually apply, and told me it is implemented two weeks ago. I can tell that he did on purpose. Went well with UPS in the adjacent plaza.<//review>

<Text>I avoided coming back to this location for over 1/2 a year because I didn't like the service (employees were grumpy with an attitude).

It was quite different when I went there today to use their scanner. Rafael was pleasant and helpful and his counterparts seemed focused and professional. I would've given this location 2 stars in the past, but now I'm upping it to 4 stars. Hopefully, the good service will continue.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I had received FedEx package but I needed to return it. I gave them exactly the package what I had received, but they said it needs paper filler. And literally just some brown paper for $3.99+tax . My point was it didn’t have any filler when it delivered,how come required me to pay for the filler when I return it!!) What a rip off.. My friend told me that she had similar experience at FedEx too.. Anyways, DISAPPOINTED :(</Text><time>1559100862093< /time><Name>Ling< /Name>< Pics>

I've been to this store twice and had pretty bad experiences both times.

I saw one employee being rude to several people, though not to me. To one person, I actually saw her visibly turn away from him and roll her eyes after giving him attitude. To another person, she gave him unhelpful answers and acted like he was dumb when he indicated that he didn't quite know how to follow her instructions. She was a terrible helper.

In addition, the printing machines do not work well. The first time I was here, the machine had issues with processing my credit card. It would give me the little 'spinner' for minutes at a time before finally displaying an error. Eventually, after enough attempts, it was able to process my credit card. The machines are very slow and using them takes way longer than it should. What should have been a 15 minute visit ended up taking probably closer to 45 minutes.

The second time I came, I was unable to log in to Google Drive at all. I was presented with a 'spinner' that would spin for several minutes before displaying an error. And the error was the same error that was displayed when I had the credit card problems. So it's not like it was a descriptive error. I tried several times and probably wasted 10-15 minutes. I finally asked an employee and he said that none of the machines were able to connect to Google Drive at the moment due to an issue with upgrading Fedex's network in the office. But there were no signs posted to explain this problem, which is odd. Why wouldn't they have posted signs to let people know that they were having issues with Google Drive.

Both of these issues should not have been issues. Processing credit cards and getting files via Google Drive are pretty core functions for printing documents, especially those that are too big to be emailed as attachments (25 MB limit).

The person who rang me up for my second visit did not speak clearly so it was hard to understand him, as well.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Worst Fedex in the history of the universe. I should have learned my lesson the first time I came here. NOT A SINGLE PERSON AVAILABLE TO HELP, EVER! The few people that are in there clearly don’t want to be there and don’t care to help with their printers, while you’re getting charged per min on the computer. All the workers there are running around like chickens with their heads cut off and could care less that their lack of working printers and inability to provide minimal customer service is frustrating to their customers. NEVER AGAIN WILL I STEP FOOT IN THIS SORRY EXCUSE OF A PRINT AND SHIP CENTER. UNBELIEVABLE.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Waited in line for over 20 minutrs minutes today as where others. Only one associate working. She proceeded to take someone that walked up, who had similar queries to those in line. Really? What was the point of the line? Probably of the worst FedEx locations I have been too. Other locations at least greet you when you come in.<//Review>

<text>This is by far the worst FedEx I have ever been too. It's a nicer, newer store with more resources than most other FedEx stores but for some reason their timelines for getting stuff done are longer, more expense and generally worse quality. It blows my mind when they tell me it takes 24 hours to do something that the FedEx up the street can do it 15 min. I don't know if the staff is just lazy or not properly trained to use the equipment but their turn around is horrible. Do yourself a service and drive up the street to the Santa Monica FedEx, much more helpful staff and they are much much better at their jobs</text><UserId.>110019934867786152900<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Inexcusable

By far the WORST fed ex print location in Los Angeles and Ive been to several. Recently the staff manager refused to answer a quick question because he was on break, even though he was standing directly behind the counter. Had to then call to get him to answer the question, which he then did. This was to set up an order of which I sent in artwork via there email three times to no success. Whereas other FED ex locations did receive the files so they were formatted properly and simple .pdf. Not only did I call and be on hold for ten minutes at a time to get through but upon a human answering the line they simply said the order never came in and even if I were to come in the simple print job of double sided color of 4 pages would take 6 hours!

Will now need to trek to another location further away to get proper service...</Review>< Pics>

They removed the free FedEx boxes so you are forced to go to the counter. They happily take your stuff, pack it up using unnecessary filler and boxes you have to pay for without asking or letting you know the cost, print the shipping label, and then tack to packing costs on at the very end. Costs you 50% of the shipping cost. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.< /review>

I've been waiting in line 10 minutes just to ship something with an envelope already prepared and the clerk then asks anyone if they're picking up a package, so they took the lady who just arrived, but I'd been waiting 10 minutes and her transaction was no faster than mine!!  and then the clerk takes off and I'm still waiting...  it's been at least 15 minutes now. this is unacceptable...  I go to FedEx's all the time but I've never seen such disorganization.  there are a lot of employees around but they're slow or lazy!!  never coming here again.  it would be better to drive 5 minutes out of your way than waste your time here.<//text>

<review>I couldn't agree more with the guy who reviewed before me. The person was the Assistant Manager , and wanted me to buy something that would hold the package .I was shipping my beats back to apple for a repair and they had sent me the box i was suppose to ship it back in. Absolutely no sense of customer service . And the I believe it privately owned by an Indian , so they are out to get every nickel out of your pocket.</review>< Pics>

There's particularly one person who is very rude and lazy working there. She powertrips on customers to have inconvenience. We had 2 really bad experiences with this lady. Kinko's at this location really need to retrain people who work there. Very disorganized, seems no communications happen in between workers and often time they can't find what you ordered.
I don't like to write bad reviews but this needs to get fixed.</review>

the manager and the workers are very rude and lazy. one of the worker dropped my 2TB HARD DRIVE, and the manager SHE did not apologize would cut my words through the phone call. And also their prints are bad too so do not go to this Fedex...go to the other Fedex near the santamonica area or other place<//Review>

Such a tiny store but my boyfriend loves ecco shoes so I was going to get him a pair for his birthday, and lucky him ecco was having a BOGO sale so he will instead be getting TWO PAIRS of amazing ecco shoes and I will look like I spent the big bucks on him, but little does he know!

But I got him one pair of black dress shoes and then a more casual white pair and I think hes going to love both of them!</Text>

This store is great! Me and my husband have been here many times and it never disappoints with selection and prices. It’s always a great deal and some very comfortable shoes. Sabrina helped  us out couple times and we couldn’t be happier with the customers service. Will be back again!</Review>

A little bit "tense" situation when you enter a store and employees start "checking" at you constantly, besides; not that "kindly" service.</text>

<Review>Staff was a bit busy but the shoes were nice but I feel that they were extremely over priced. But they did have a clearance section I thought was reasonable. The facility was extremely clean but didn't seem as if there were enough customers in there. Over all the quality of items in there were extremely nice but again I don't think they were worth the price<//Review>< Rating>

Please don't steal the advice of these great people then buy the same shoe online.  "support local business" is what this city preaches and with good reason.  Let's keep this business around- out feet need it.  Happy feet=less grumpiness=more peace.<//text>

Super helpful staff.  Very nice and well organized store with lots of stock.  I was able to find the shoes I was looking for and with the buy one, get the second 50% off, I was able to get a second pair as well.< /Review>

<review>Ecco is the hidden gem of footwear. Most people I talk to never consider it when shopping for decent formal or semi-formal shoes and I'm not sure why because it rocks!! The selection is really good, and you're sure to find lots of looks you wouldn't see at other stores. Give these guys a shot!< /review>< user_id>

<Text>The Pool is a Great diversion from the Heat. Next time I will try and get My Aunt Donna who is 90 yrs old to go  in the Water for a few minutes. Now that she had seen everything this will help her go in next time. At 90 yrs old,  it's not easy to convince her all is good and safe.
Thank You<//Text>< response>

It's a beautiful place... there are three 9-hole golf courses, you'll see ponds and waterfalls and brooks... and it's well taken care of. I should know because I work here!!!!< /review>

It's a very nice place to have any events you may have.  The main ballroom is large and holds about 200 - 300 people.  There is a good size parking lot with handicapped parking.<//review>

Nice people good prices on new and used appliances. Bought a side by side refrigerator freezer from them 7 or 8 years ago and it's still going strong. Picked up a used LG washer and electric dryer set for $600 out the door. Will be back to pick up a replacement for our gas stove soon< /Review>

<Text>The washing machine they claim was tested pours soapy water out of the bottom and does not agitate at all. We only ran it once and quite a disaster. Called right away and have been playing phone tag for a week. Someone was scheduled to come today between noon and 3:00, but no show. No responses to our calls and texts. Not sending blessings to these swindlers.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809072b1a1805ba3:0xdb953b98786d4943</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If I could give them negative stars i would. Those two ladies at customer service are terrible. If I could contact the owner of the place I would show him that video I made in that shop how that lady was threatening me to call cops so they can through me out of shop. The owner should change both of them otherwise he will lose his customers forever. They even lied about technician's availability and tried to tell me that I am behaving strange these two should be out of this business.<//text>

<user_name>Debbie Robbins< /user_name><Review>DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY YOU WILL BE SORRY AND REGRET FOR STEPPING FOOT ON THE PREMISES!!!0
I purchased a washer and dryer set on July 31, 2020. I was told that they would deliver them the next day which was a Saturday between the hours of 12pm - 4pm. We made a commitment to be somewhere at 2pm and were told I would receive a phone call 1 hour in advance when they were on their way. We waited for a phone call which never happened the weekend went by and never heard anything from them at all. I waited both Monday and Tuesday came and went with no word of a new delivery time. I called this place of business several times with no answer and finally got through on Wednesday Aug.5th in the mid afternoon. I was asked several questions in clouding name, phone number, name on the sales invoice and what was purchased. I finally got my washer and dryer delivered outside because of COVID so we had to move both of these into the house and hook them up. I then tried to wash a load of clothes and wasn’t able to because the lid lock wasn’t working and beeped non stop so I ended up disconnecting the power cord in order for the beeping to stop. I called the following day and was told they would order the part and fix it here. Almost two weeks later still no part and unable to use my washer. I finally got a hold of this company asking if the part came in and they tried to reach me several times but my phone was broken and being repaired. I revived my phone back two weeks later once called this place when they would be here to fix my washer. The woman on the phone said she would have to speak with her boss and get back to me and once again nothing. I was very angry by this time once again I made several calls just to get someone answer the phone. The woman on the phone told me that they did not have the part needed to fix my washer. I was then asked my name, number, persons name on the invoice so again I answered her questions. The next sentence out of her mouth was I will have someone pick up your washer and bring something similar breaking up my set. I explained to her I wanted my washer fixed and didn’t want any replacements they chose to bring and 99.9999% were garbage and didn’t work properly. I was told she needed pictures of my washer so they could match it with the invoice and my information. I was way beyond mad and ready to chew her out one for being rude, unprofessional and not even the slightest interest of what I was asking for bit instead I got the run a around again. I went rounds with these people trying to get them to pick up my washer then fix it and return it to me the following day. I was promised two more times that someone would be here to pick it up. Days and more rounds with this company and their very rude unprofessional employees still nothing but more excuses, lies and broken promises. Today September 22, 2020 almost 2 months from the time of purchase my washer was fixed for how long who knows. I put a load of clothes into the washer and started like it’s supposed to but I’m not holding my breath that this will be the end of this three ring circus of hell.
I do not recommend purchasing anything from this company. If you do not pay for what was purchased in full you will be billed as a lease. Regardless of purchasing price they will try and charge you a lot more including interest for 12 months....it’s nothing a vicious never ending circle that never stops!!!</Review>< gmapID>

The prices are great the customer service.......not so great. I had a delivery set up for a Saturday and when that day came it never got delivered... I called and they told me around 3pm that the delivery driver didn’t come to work today, but no one called to let me know that. I offered to pick up my appliance and Emily stayed that she would check on that and call me back... we’ll guess what no one called me back and when I called her no one answered.... I just want what I paid for< /review>

<Text>I purchase many major appliances from HBTG not only do I save over half what I spend else where, I get reliable and quality products for half the price!  You can expect to find exactly what you are looking for in your budget range with 100% satisfaction. With prompt service and excellent customer service. I highly recommend shopping at HBTG ! This is a definite 5 star shopping experience. Thank you again to my rep Emily at HBTG.< /Text>< Pics>

No compren de esos lugates. Fui ahora a comprar la estufa en la foto y cuando llegue me la quisieron venter a $300 y no al precio que la  De $200. Les enseñe la photo y todavia se negaron. Son gente mala. Y no quisieron bajar el presio. No se les confie. Se negaron que era la misma estufa y era su pajina.

Went in today to purchase this stove and when I went into the store they increases the price on the stove and denied it being posted by them at a much lower price. They would not give me the stove for the advertised price and refused to help me. They are running a bad business. Be careful they are known to rip people off. The facebook page is called good stuff/ quality stuff. But its actually these two businesses.<//text>

Purchase my black washer and dryer set from Hbtg back in June 2019. First time I ever use the washer it leak water alot  .call them to come repair it since we had a year warranty.  Took them three week to come get it. Gave a me replacement (which was a different model ,color)while it was getting repair .didn't here back for a month. Keep and calling and customer service kept tell me the repair guy will call me back . Nope I had to call until I got ahold of them. Was told the washer wasn't repairable. That they will call me when a new one comes in . Never did. Everytime I call they will lie .Here 6 months later still no update on when I will get my black dryer that purchase. Never will I refer anyone there. Worst company ever.< /review>

Worst Customer Service I've ever experienced.  Save yourself some grief and go somewhere else, there are plenty of alternatives.  First, they over charged me by $100 and promised to refund it but never did.  Then, their 3 month warranty is a joke.  I called within the 1st week since the wash machine was leaking drom the front door.  Called many times over several weeks, kept being told someone would call me to schedule apt., never  happened, finally gave up.  Will never do business with this company again, nor will I recommend them to anyone.< /text>

This place is the biggest joke! I bought a dryer on a Thursday and was supposed to receive it on Friday morning. The delivery window was 10-12. They actually arrived at 3:30 that afternoon. The dryer they brought us sounded like it was about to explode. It was not usable. Conveniently they're closed on the weekends, so Monday I called and they were supposed to bring us a replacement on Tuesday morning. It's now Tuesday night and we still haven't received the dryer. They didn't answer their phone all afternoon and now the office is closed....I will NEVER go through these people again. If you're smart you won't either. The workers look like drug addicts or exconvicts. It's truly a joke...yet I'm not laughing not even a little bit. I paid these people $180 and have nothing to show for it except a dryer that sounds like it will catch on fire if it's used. So buyer's beware of this place! You'll regret buying from them! 😠😠😠😠😠</Text>

If it was possible to give no stars or negative stars I would. This place is an absolute joke. They don't know how to fix anything. I bought three appliances from them and have had to fight with them since day one to get them come out and fix them. They always tell me the same thing. Our driver is already out and he's gonna be there at noon but they never show. So either me or my wife calls them back and they say that they will be there at 3-6 but still never show. We have both had to take time off several times to wait for them and they don't show up. I'm going to be calling my credit card company and doing a charge back which is something I would recommend that everyone does to this piece of crap "business". I hope I can get my money back from the credit card company because they have breached he contract by not fixing their appliances. I hope we can get this place shut down soon.<//Review>

<review>ELDERLY ABUSE!! I am Not giving them ANY Stars for their inconsiderate attitudes towards their  customers! Owner is just as RUDE as his two female assistants! RUDE on the phone and also rude in person! I paid $200.00 for a refrigerator that my grandmother needed in her new home she moved to. I was informed that the electrical cord needed to be replaced but their electrician was not there that day, so they offered to deliver it for FREE the next day after their electrician replaced the cord. Well their electrician didn't show up for work that following day and they delivered the broken refrigerator anyways and promised to send electrician out to house to repair the cord when he arrived to work. They never sent the electrician, they never replaced the cord now the fridge blows out the light bulbs, will not stay cold and leaks water inside and out! Cord is sparking!  FIRE HAZARD FOR AN 85 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER! I brought this to their attention and apparently it's my job to bring the fridge to them to be repaired! How disrespectful this business is ran! No compassion for any of their customers!! Read all the other comments from other people about this place. Horrifying! Will never do business worth them again!!# company and employees are worthless!!!</review>< pictures>

Bought an LG washer and dryer from this company. The washer went out they refused to come out and pick it up to fix it then the dryer went out. They still refused to come out and pick it up to Fix. got the finance company involved and this company said they don’t do refunds and would not deal with the finance company and hung up on them. I would never recommend  this company to anyone. They’re liars and cheats and will not stand behind their product<//Text>

<Text>Made a purchase of Appliance on last Monday from Emily and she told me that they will  make the delivery on Wednesday. Wednesday comes and there's no delivery and I didn't heard from them by set time , I called them and they very rude and without admitting mistake moved the delivery to next day. Same thing happens again and no delivery and they stop answering the phone, I show up at their store Thursday and she rudely says that they never said to deliver on Wednesday or Thursday but they can deliver on Friday. Guess what , no delivery , I called they said we'll be there in two hours , waited all day for them. I went back to their store on Saturday and asked if they'll make the delivery or not she said we'll not make the delivery and won't give you the appliances, keep this in mind that I already made full payment.
This is a shady business with completely zero to nothing customer service. I am taking them to court but don't be conned by these guys. Stay away from business!.</Text>< username>

Ask to see the warranty in writing regardless of what the salesperson says. They will not repair unless you it bring it to them... It's been 4 months, the refrigerator, washer and dryer work fine, although the wheels on the fridge broke within three months.</Text>

<Text>I read all these negative reviews and was so puzzled as I got a washer n dryer from them many years ago after my very expensive front loader top of the line washer kept going out , The washer n dryer I got from this used appliance was just fine for my needs so now I needed a new washer n dryer couldn't recall the name , I came across the website n went right down and got another set   , could not have been treated nicer and they deliver for only 15. In town , could not be happier as today is Wednesday the day we wash our clothes 🤣< /Text>< gmap_id>

Picked up a front loading washing machine and dryer combo. $800 newer set. Not even two months later machine stops draining. Simple pump replacement. After two weeks of "tmrrw between 3-6 pm" I finally gave up and went to the parts supply house ordered the pump, which they had in stock, and replaced it myself. YOUTUBE.  Less then 2 hours. Bottom line, their "90 day warranty" is BS. Gives you a sense of false security. Second and last time I go to these people for anything!!</Text>

Good deals, they warranty and repair or replace if you're not satisfied. Not to mention good financing. Other bad reviews look fake.</Text>

I’ve worked in customer service over 11+ years and a General Manager to 2 different stores when your about to lose customers you should do whatever it takes to keep your potential customers to make and help your revenue grow but you guys don’t do any of the above for goodness sakes, you guys don’t even answer your phone calls and never call back when you guys are supposed to. How do you guys expect to keep a business going if you do none of the above?? So to Emily that works at this location your formalities that you have with customers come off as rude this is entirely for your FYI,  with that rudeness don’t expect to keep much of your customers for long. NO CUSTOMERS! NO REVENUE! always keep that in mind. If you expect to stay in business for long.< /text>

<Review>Do not go here ...I'm so extremely upset right now...for over a week in been dealing with this horrible place we bought a stove and dishwasher from..the stove they delivered was broken and didn't heat up and the dishwasher won't close and leaks  water everywhere...my husband tried pulling the stove out causing it to break the glass top on top. I called the place every day for a week and a half and they keep giving me the run around...most of the days tgey just ignored me..they said the boss with call me which he never has. Finally today the lady named emily calls me and says I can pay 300 more and they will give me a new stove and I told her I'm already paying 1200 why would I pay more..so she said that's your only option or i can give you a basic stove which is really crappy or your stuck with what you have contact someone else...I called the credit people and they put a hold on my account for 2 months.i have 3 kids and I can't even cook for them..I've been buying food out and having family cook for us..I contacted a lawyer which is gonna call me back and I also reported to curtis news, I won't stop there..I also am gonna stand in front of their store to let people know not to buy here..I will be putting signs up everywhere about my story. I will contact more news places also...they don't at all help you. I have all messages from all the girls and I have a strong case against them< /Review>< Pics>

<review>We went for dinner as a large group of 4 families with kids.  Service was pretty fast but good luck finding a server.  You order and pay from your phone and they bring out the food.  If you need anything, you have to walk around to find a server.  As far as the food goes, well, I remember the food being better than it was. :(<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This place is gorgeous, it's kind of tucked back in a weird location but it has probably one of the most unique atmospheres of any restaurant I've been to in San Diego. Beer was great, service was quick, and phone ordering from your table was easy and covid friendly. Menu is currently reduced and the offerings seemed a little over priced for what you get.< /review>

Now utilizes online menu and pay first, food and service comes later. Which is rather trouble some if you want some follow up orders. Online menu is a little bit difficult to navigate.
4oz beer to try a little of everything, too bad there isn’t a assorted beer tasting platter.
Steak was alright with herb garlic butter.
Truffle fries were great! Shrimp and artichoke dip was decent too.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1agRK-lFCYHKN3o7vU0GekbpdIk9aUEdgEVzT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKsOc0wSCuvIWYSWtrY0P-sAlk_n9HY1c4peWe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-LbealnTz_zS7sLzvzSnu86Bzr1V466TCWDeN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbWowNaZMPBf-BXjCtpTllcnG3zOwqsVqgBUro=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJaPlbRMDLotc-ilmSTxU5vnP0wggplctzPOz7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPe9N6sb5yvDUoYeVXHZNkGYmwuk4AuSg163Nj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

There is a QR code on the table you order and pay from an APP, and food gets delivered to your table. There are no servers working to really talk with. Food was good and delivered as ordered. With go back when they re-open to have wait staff, as we had to order a few times because the APP would time out as people were deciding on what they want.</Review>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Their service was 10/10 I felt like I was at Disneyland. Where all my dreams come true. Let's not forget about the view. They have the most playful koi pound. The beers are very interesting, they have a great variety of sours, fruity, and stouts. If you are looking for a good beer this is the stop for you. Food needs more creativity; focus on a smaller menu to perfect 👌 all the flavors require. Regardless of my tough criticism, the Brussels sprouts that I had were cooked to perfection ( that is hard to do and they kill it). Thank you for your good 👍 service. Also if you disable they have plenty of sitting options.<//Review>< name>

Karl Strauss is the best,  beer, food, and service is always great. Of the 6 beers I tried.. I diffently recommend the porter or the 99 calorie ipa while you over look the peaceful Japanese garden with waterfalls, and coy swim under the deck. Personally coolest Brewery I've been too. Diffently recommend stopping by for the food, brew and the view if your in town.😎💯<//Text>

Unfortunately I was there for a memorial celebration. I think if it had been for a different reason I could have enjoyed the time more. The setting is pretty cool for being in what looked like a  Business park. The staff was a little short handed but did their best to keep up with the crowd. I tried the ahi tuna nachos and a peanut butter cup stout. Would do the nachos again probably not the stout.  I think it would be a great place for a lunch date.< /review>

<Review>The natural & sculpted beauty that surrounds this place is outstanding and extremely zenful, peaceful, delightful, and completely unexpected!   A small stroll under some trees, a bridge to cross, a med-large pond with large Koi Fish, Lotus Flowers, Lily pads, a running waterfall, a place for musicians to play, etc...  I would go back again to simply enjoy & experience the feelings that the scenary brought out of me.

The drawback for me wasn't even the wait time.  It was not having a server to take our  order.  You order and pay for your meal first and then they bring it out to you - very impersonal and goes against the message the surrounding natural beauty brings out.

There are greeters who greet you with positive energy to take your name and tell you how long the wait time is.  After that,  it gets more distant and frustrating.   There are no mixed drinks here and the food served us was disappointing.

This place is located between large buildings within a Business Park and there is ample parking.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc0715da411f5b:0xca385eb992acebdb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The ambiance was great at night. The food was pretty good too.

Minus one star for rushing us out before we finished our food and drinks.</text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Gorgeous setting! They have done away with table and bar ordering, so be ready to pull out your phone, scan the QR code taped to the table and navigate their online menu every time you want to order another dish/drink.

It's like ordering take-out with delivery on their patio. It would benefit them to see how Chili's started this trend years ago. If you want the customers to order themselves, put a tablet and credit card reader on the tables!

Personally, I'll wait for tableside service before returning. Bummer.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The wait time for a table, on a Saturday night, was 5 mins. Even the food arrived on time. The food was decent! Staff was pretty friendly.

food was good
I ordered the fish tacos
the fish had a good seasoning to it and it was a good proportion piece of fish 3 per order. The fish and chips is probably the best in San Diego my opinion as well as my guests opinion
The beer never disappoints
See you again soon Aloha<//text>

This spot is hands down one of my favorite spots to go to! From their large outdoor patio overlooking a large pond with koi fish and Lilly pads to their fun/inviting atmosphere - plus great food + beer. They have it all!

I've been here a few times and it's always my suggestion when looking for a fun hangout with friends, coworkers after work, or a casual date night with my boyfriend.

From their truffle fries, ahi nachos, mac & cheese, to their blackened mahi tacos and their burgers - you can't go wrong with food either!

They have beer for every taste plus their own hard seltzer, and even some wines.

Shout out to Krista and Laura for their great recommendations on beer and such great service! I'll see you again soon!< /review>

<Text>I tried the Cheddar Cheese Burger which was Very disappointing! Burger patty is Dry with No Seasoning. I should have sent it back but I was too hungry. So I tried to "doctor " it up with salt, ketchup and mustard. This was my 3rd time try their food because I like the atmosphere but 3 strikes YOUR OUT! I won't be returning. Plus No TP in bathroom! 😖</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great food, amazing scenery.  I loved the wings and fries.  The beer selection was great as well.  But the patio... Man I could sit out there all day, so beautiful.

<Text>Great location and ambience. I’m not a big fan of Brussels sprouts but they are amazing. The chicken Korea bowl was good and mildly spicy. The Karl Strauss Hef was good, maybe not great. A bit bitter.<//Text>< Pics>

As for food/drink- I enjoyed the Amber I had, my husband wasn't a fan of the hefeweise he had.
Food was good, the Buffalo burger was delish.i will say the service was so so. We went when it was busy so it took a while to get food and they forgot my friends order. You have to order from the QR code so you don't see the wait staff much and it takes a while to get their attention.
I would go back, but when it was less busy.< /Text>< Pictures>

My burger was very gross, they literally put a one inch thick onion slice on it. The bread was like plastic. The fries were drenched in grease and all I could taste was the fryer oil that was most definitely old. Never coming back.< /text>

Surrounded by trees and a overlooking a pond, this location is ideal for outdoor dining. Fresh air and a nice breeze help you feel safer while you're enjoying your gastropub entrées. Plenty of beer on tap and available to-go. The beer and views contribute to the four-star rating, whereas the food was not memorable. Overall recommended.</text>

The food was mediocre, which is sad because the downtown location used to be consistently above average.  The setting is nice and the staff was great, otherwise I would have rated it lower.  Wouldn't mind coming back for just a beer and to watch the koi, but I would not recommend eating here at all.< /text>

A great experience with great food. They've implemented a safe way to minimize contact in the days of covid by providing a scannable QR code that will take you to that website and allow you to place your order remotely. The drinks came quickly as did the food. Payment was done through the site as well and it was all very painless. And the food was great too!  The outdoor dining was very serene and lovely and they even helped us with an outdoor heater when the wind got a little cooler. Overall a very pleasant experience.  The Coy pond is awesome.< /Text>

The dining experience was ..an experience.  Super good food. The restaurant is 100% QR interface with customers leaves customers,  or me, begging for help.  can't get a beer or water or malt vinegar or pepper. One guesses that they'll retain the touchless contactless system because it reduces labor. But I won't be coming ever again due to the collapse of "hospitality"</Text>

Relaxing place for a cold brew and a lunch. Most of the seating is patio sitting right next to their large Koi Pond. Nice place to unwind! I recommend the new Red Trolley Colab with Bird Rock Coffee very refreshing!< /Text>

A really nice facility, has a nice pond with fish and a big garden, looks like it was meant to be a japanese or chinese restaurant.
Now a american food and beer brewery, one of the San Diego's classics.<//review>

Really nice place for hangouts. Food wasn't too bad. I got their new Korean chicken bbq bowl. It was decent but too healthy tasting. Not what I was looking for. Friends got the chicken sandwich and it looked really good. The truffle fries was also really good. They have a nice pond filled with koi and supposedly a turtle somewhere.</Review>

Great food, great beer and great location. I don't normally get to enjoy delicious beer next to a Koi pond and a rock fountain. I was lucky I was also able to pick up the Endless Summer seltzer 12 pack from here, which I haven't been able to find in too many other places. Oh, that pretzel is delicious 👽👍🏽<//Review>

In these difficult times for those in the food service industry, I have got to give great kudos to the entire crew at Karl Strauss Sorrento Mesa and all the other Karl Strauss restaurants too.  They have consistently kept up the great quality food and service.  I've been here twice this week and they just don't skip a beat getting things right !  THANKS!</Review>

Great food selection, and tasty food.

Everyone was wearing a mask, but there were a few people eating to go orders on the patio. Easy to avoid though if you're just picking up food.<//Review>

<review>Although there are many Karl Strauss locations throughout SD, we seem to always find ourselves at the Sorrento Valley location more than others.  Located within an office complex, this particular location feels like an oasis away from the city with the Japanese garden (a nice twist on the traditional term "beer garden"), and it's definitely the major selling point for us visiting this location.  Otherwise, the restaurant serves up solid beer food and tapped beers from Karl Strauss.  Plenty of seating for large parties and beer tends to taste better when there's a large group...< /review>< UserId.>

Love to go here every week for their grass fed burger and fries. Pro tip, ask for the onions grilled and it will be excellent. Service there is amazing, the staff are amazing. Have fun, great beer too</Review>

<gmapID>0x80dc0715da411f5b:0xca385eb992acebdb</gmapID><Text>Wow, this place is incredible. Not only is the restaurant beautiful -- sprawling multi-leveled outdoor patio surrounded by luscious trees, massive koi pond, and central bar -- the food is delicious. Everything we had was incredible. They have options for everybody whether you are vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, or just love meat. You can't go wrong here. Also, the prices are decent and have an extensive house craft beer list.< /Text><user>110117401330309306526</user>< name>

Good selection of beer, and food is quite nice. Not as hyped as Ballast Point. Parking is much easier here too. Has been my routine casual dinner place when in San Diego.<//Review>

You get vibe of a classy beer-n-wings place the moment you step in the vicinity of Karl Strauss! I loved the way they have designed their entrance besides a pond.
First things first, the food served here is very high quality! I could guess that even a dish as simple as Nachos involved a bunch of ingredients that not all of the restaurants out there would consider adding.
The servants are pretty friendly too! I specially liked the fact that one of us got a complimentary tasting of an additional beer which was sort of another version of what he just had!
For non-alcoholic folks, they have got Root Beer Float which is an amazing option!
The seating by the pond is aptly heated and one may not feel any cold during winters!
Although Karl Strauss puts your meal a little on the expensive side, it is completely justified by their hospitality, ambience and food! I would definitely recommend this place for someone looking to spend quality time eating! :)</review>

Very surprising for being in the middle of an industrial park! Brunch is really inexpensive for the quality of food and choices. There is live music  Also i believe this is the only one with koi pond and it is pretty and relaxing.  Staff is very friendly cant wait to go back!!<//Review>

This place was flipping amazing that we went back the next day. The food was amazing, the person serving us was amazing and the beer selection was great. Did research before coming to San Diego and this spot was on the list and only a few minutes from the hotel. They had very friendly people here and the burger that I had was so good and the fries were delicious. I wish I could've taken some beer home with me.< /Review>

<Text>Amazing place for happy hour and dinner.  The atmosphere and business friendly environment of this place is amazing for people to hang out after work.  The restroom is clean and the serenity of the outdoor dining place is fantastic.  We had a wonderful waiter that was very attentive and curteous.  The appetizers and food were great.  I didn't really like the sheppard's pie, i had better elsewhere.  Besides that, everything else were great.</Text>< Name>

No more wait staff, and seriously reduced menu. Been going here for 20 years and this past weekend was probably my last visit.  Since no more wait staff, the prices are way too high now.  I am bummed because this used to be a favorite!</text>

< Review>
A tale of two cities.  Beer was fabulously cold and good, all 4 we tried.  Downhill from there.  Went for lunch, first time in years to the Koi Pond location. Of course, new Covid procedures were in place but one has to figure all this out.  We gravitated to a huge menu to study meal options when some burly order taker who hasn't learned how to smile or interact with human beings just stared us down curtly.  I guess we were supposed to know our food choices before seeing the menu.  Fine.  We waited in the beautiful garden area after ordering really enjoying our beers and observing the courteous and hard working wait staff.  And waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  Well over a half hour later, our very disappointing food arrived.  What happened Karl?  Used to be a real treat.  Pastrami sandwich's meat dry, tough and sliced too thick.  Sausages were both bland, if one was a brat, you'd never know it.  Finally, the pretzels were way off, cold, lacking much salt and served with two cups of the same sauce.  Total disappointment except for the brews.  Hardly worth the money, even with the Koi.</Review>

Decent beers and a good outdoor vibe. Too many rules to understand before even sitting down and enjoying yourself. But its a COVID thing and understandable..</review>

GOOD TIME ! We came here for lunch a while back to catch up with an old friend now living in New York ( pre-covid ). My wife and I had not dined here since 2004 when we were visiting from Australia. It looked like the place has had a makeover since then. It was packed to the rafters but we managed to get a good table for 6 on the high level looking down to the bar. Everyone enjoyed their food but because it was a work day lunch no one was drinking alcohol. Nice atmosphere with the huge Koi pond greeting you at the entrance. Obviously being in the heart of a business district with huge companies like Qualcomm next door keeps the pub pretty flat out !</review>

Can't go wrong at K. Great choices of beer, appetizers and food. I've hosted big groups, attended business meetings, enjoyed happy hours and have taken family many times. A nice neighborhood brewery and restaurant. My favorite Ginger crusted salmon, melon tabouli salad and all appetizers. Chicken Chop Shop is one my fav.< /text>

There’s a few places that can have a good quality Sunday Bruch Buffet with bottomless mimosas, and that’s this place. The food quality is amazing, and the ambiance has to be on par with that of a brewery on a Sunday morning 👌🏼

Servers are always checking to see if you need anything, and the service was great.

I’ll definitely be coming back soon! Keep it up guys ✌🏼</review>

< review>
Came here on a lunch date with hubby about two months ago and really enjoyed it! The scenery here is stunning. We were lucky to be able to grab a table outside and got to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and beauty of nature.

Food here is pretty good but options are slightly limited beyond sandwiches, tacos, and pasta.

Our server was very friendly, I can't remember his name but he was very courteous and polite.

We ordered the duck fat pretzels for our appetizer and omg!!! Sooo good! The truffle dipping sauce that came with them was absolutely divine.

For our main meal I ordered the farmhouse burger while hubby had the chipotle pastrami sandwich. He originally wanted the Cioppino but apparently that had been discontinued so he opted for his second favorite food.

My burger was really good but a little on the heavy side. I guess because it had a lot going on. Hubby's pastrami was yummy and juicy, the bread it came on though not so much. I think it was a sourdough ciabatta and that usually takes away from the taste of the food. At least for me anyway. Otherwise everything was great.

I'd definitely come back again! The atmosphere alone is worth it.</review>

< Review>
I have never been a fan of their beers, but decided to give it another try after several years.   I was shocked at the quality of the beer and how well it was done.    As far as food, this was an amazing meal.  The pork chops are misdescribed on the menu...they are WAY better!!!!  The hot mustard with the teriyaki style sauce paired so well together.  Chops were cooked perfectly...the vegis were fresh and cooked perfectly.   I was honestly very surprised at the taste and freshness.. I will be back.</Review>

No more wait staff, and seriously reduced menu. Been going here for 20 years and this past weekend was probably my last visit.  Since no more wait staff, the prices are way too high now.  I am bummed because this used to be a favorite!< /review>

A tale of two cities.  Beer was fabulously cold and good, all 4 we tried.  Downhill from there.  Went for lunch, first time in years to the Koi Pond location. Of course, new Covid procedures were in place but one has to figure all this out.  We gravitated to a huge menu to study meal options when some burly order taker who hasn't learned how to smile or interact with human beings just stared us down curtly.  I guess we were supposed to know our food choices before seeing the menu.  Fine.  We waited in the beautiful garden area after ordering really enjoying our beers and observing the courteous and hard working wait staff.  And waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  Well over a half hour later, our very disappointing food arrived.  What happened Karl?  Used to be a real treat.  Pastrami sandwich's meat dry, tough and sliced too thick.  Sausages were both bland, if one was a brat, you'd never know it.  Finally, the pretzels were way off, cold, lacking much salt and served with two cups of the same sauce.  Total disappointment except for the brews.  Hardly worth the money, even with the Koi.<//Text>

This place has a relaxed vibe next to a koi pond and the service is always attentive and friendly. They always have great food and is a family favorite. The sweet potato fries and steak are very good<//review>

Came to L.A. for a quick trip to check out the Universal Horror Nights.  While here we decided to check out Karl Strauss.  We had some snacks and some great beer.

The place was slammed though.  Very busy and still managed to service everyone pretty quick.

I really enjoyed the beer and next time I’m in Los Angeles (Laker game next month) we will be stopping here for sure.

Thanks for a great time.<//text>

<review>Went there every night in my week stay at San Diego. First, the beer selection is top notch. I had the Wreck Alley, which backs the name up very well and adds a great taste. Every plate I had was near perfection in both presentation and flavor.

I would highly recommend! 😁👍< /review>< gmapID>

As far as food this place is average. I tried their pasta w veggies, burgers, salad with ahí tuna. Burgers are not bad but there was a time when I got burger which was almost a raw meat. I realized after I bit on it. It had to be sent back. Pasta and salads flavorless.</text>

<username>Matt Ricketts<//username><review>Great service, great food, great drinks too. I'm not normally a wine fan, but Prisoner's is one of my few favorites. I was really surprised to learn that they sell it by the glass here. Define not normal to see Prisoner's sold by the glass instead of the bottle.
Being here for happy hour we ordered many appetizers, of which they were all yummy too.</review>< user>

<user_name>Faustine Vuong< /user_name><Review>Almost everyone at my table ordered the steak frites. My grandma and cousins absolutely loved their truffle fries. And the steak was amazing as well. My aunt ordered a different dish, but they had run out so they let her order another dish on the house. So of course she got the steak frites. I really appreciate them being very accommodating and their excellent customer service. The restaurant is gorgeous by the way. It would probably look nicer during the day. At night, their pond area is not very well lit.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This was a great choice for a family outing.  The manager, I want to say his name was Johnathan: tall dude, large build, dark hair, morning manager on a weekend.  Let us in with our 100lbs Rottweiler.  The staff were very courteous to our large group.  We had a toddler, a dog and six others in the group.  Beer and service were excellent and memorable, however what stood out was the hospitality that the manager initially conveyed.

This review is regarding a visit that was from a period in time when there was no covid, many many months before, August 2019.

If and when we're given the opportunity to return, we'll do so.</text>

<Text>I don't drink alcohol so I can't say much about their beer. The food tastes great, but a tat pricey. I guess you're really paying for the atmosphere. Top notch service. Great place for business meetings or get togethers. It can be very noisy so ask for seating outside. I recommend their Turkey Club sandwich.<//Text><time>1489798600407</time>< user_id>

Stopped in for a quick flight of brews. All four I chose were delicious. The bartender thought I missed the two best IPA"s and gave me a shot of each. LOL. He was right. Isomerizer and Big Barrel. Nice place. I will come back again.</review>

I came as part of a banquet, so the experience is a little different. The "spicy" tofu curry was not spicy, despite the name, but it was delicious!

The overall atmosphere is great, with the deck facing a koi pond. Definitely a calm, Japanese garden vibe. (An interesting choice for a brewery/restaurant.)

Parking was rather difficult. We parked on the street around 1pm. But I would definitely come back.<//review>

<Text>Can't go wrong at K. Great choices of beer, appetizers and food. I've hosted big groups, attended business meetings, enjoyed happy hours and have taken family many times. A nice neighborhood brewery and restaurant. My favorite Ginger crusted salmon, melon tabouli salad and all appetizers. Chicken Chop Shop is one my fav.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSKzW0OTFy0Wp_m27wH1YOYuXAsB--NElCwkSr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPX8pMTwoL-HUz9TYURFF0y8SP7QpqRglV5dZ4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Karl Strauss Sunday brunch is the absolute best thing to happen to my life. Their waffles are phenomenal, and their in-house syrup puts Ms. Butterscotch and Aunt Jemima on the bottom shelf. Plus, who wouldn't be ecstatic to have the opportunity to eat their buffalo chicken in an AYCE setting?

Mimosas are bottomless, beer is good. Karl Strauss is awesome.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Came here on a lunch date with hubby about two months ago and really enjoyed it! The scenery here is stunning. We were lucky to be able to grab a table outside and got to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and beauty of nature.

Food here is pretty good but options are slightly limited beyond sandwiches, tacos, and pasta.

Our server was very friendly, I can't remember his name but he was very courteous and polite.

We ordered the duck fat pretzels for our appetizer and omg!!! Sooo good! The truffle dipping sauce that came with them was absolutely divine.

For our main meal I ordered the farmhouse burger while hubby had the chipotle pastrami sandwich. He originally wanted the Cioppino but apparently that had been discontinued so he opted for his second favorite food.

My burger was really good but a little on the heavy side. I guess because it had a lot going on. Hubby's pastrami was yummy and juicy, the bread it came on though not so much. I think it was a sourdough ciabatta and that usually takes away from the taste of the food. At least for me anyway. Otherwise everything was great.

I'd definitely come back again! The atmosphere alone is worth it.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq275j8RLHhtYAFamH5vLWZzSsH-jfpytjszQG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj4eL82nVHwJ8OPrFdqKv54EvZ-1ekNVLPcID6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhuHC64vMjQK9nybK9bkqAsav75fphxx7XPLz-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3sEJ6sdaxE7K-fMLVwfql3hH1LWuYNme3EdYN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

I've eaten so many different things from the menu and never been disappointed. I love the monthly specials for switching things up! Favorites that we get all the time: hummus, Buffalo wings, Mosaic, Aurora Hoppyalis, and chilli when they have it.

Great food and beer in a nice Japanese style building and a pond. The rate that parking spots fill up during peak hours is amazing. There are a lot of parking spots to the back of the building though.<//review>

Their waffles are phenomenal, and their in-house syrup puts Ms. Butterscotch and Aunt Jemima on the bottom shelf. Plus, who wouldn't be ecstatic to have the opportunity to eat their buffalo chicken in an AYCE setting?

Mimosas are bottomless, beer is good. Karl Strauss is awesome.< /review>< Pics>

It's a little tucked away in its corner and not the most noticeable place from the street, but when you find it it's one of nicest places to eat in the area. The beer is great for all craft beer lovers, but the food is also awesome. This is great place to eat at for lunch and/or to grab a beer after work (if you happen to work near it).< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Great venue with a lovely Koi pond. But the real reason for the 5 stars, the food and beer!!  I loved everything, the steak, mac n cheese, veggies, pretzel roll, even the salad.  But my faves were tiramisu dessert and the smoked porter. Perfect pairing!</text>

Fries were a little on the salty side, but that's what beer is for. Our server was a sweetheart and brought us extra tasters to pair with our orders.  The garden is lush and there is even a koi pond.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb3fHJ2VWjtVKjzLUDoZzZ6VPVNPbPqeblj2lS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I love Karl Strauss... but I would rate it a 1 🌟 for getting rid of the Cioppino 😭😭😭... I've had Cioppino at the original restaurant that came up with it in San Francisco, and I liked Karl's better. Please bring back the Cioppino!!! 😊< /text>

<text>Great place, but adding 3% on to your bill for “Operating Costs” is just not on... I have an idea, why don’t you just pay your employees more... If you can’t afford to do that, maybe you are in the wrong business.  Customers should not have to supplement your operating costs, that’s called...being in business...< /text><name>Simon Hailwood</name>< Rating>

<text>Love, love, love everything about this Karl Strauss location. I could sit here for hours and enjoy the great service, awesome brews and fine dining—not to mention the always great weather and the relaxed, laid back atmosphere. There’s not a beer, not an item on the menu that I haven’t thoroughly enjoyed. If I have to pick a favorite beer, it’s the golden stout — 9 Bonfires Blazing.  I would gain some serious girth, but I could happily live here. It’s a good thing there are a couple thousand miles between Karl Strauss and me.</text></record>

This is a hidden gem in Sorrento Valley! If not for my friend who lives in the area, I am afraid I would never know it was there! The restaurant is beautiful, surrounded by a beautiful garden and lake (coy fish lake) it resembles a Japanese garden, if you will. Plenty of seating inside and outside, the food is amazing!!!! Customer service very prompt, friendly and knowledgeable of their menu. Plenty of parking outside.</review>

< Review>
Food here had gotten consistently less creative as the kitchen has tried to streamline and simplify the offerings.  The appetizers used to have more options and unique flavors.  Main dishes have also become less innovative.  On top of it,  K has become one of those deceptive places that adds a surcharge to the bill,  instead of just being honest and raising prices.< /Review>

The brewery is nicely located on a Japanese Garden and pond. They offer a variety of beers besides the usual IPA. On Sundays you can enjoy a brunch menu that includes mimosas or one free beer. It's a nice place to  relax.</review>

I was shocked at the quality of the beer and how well it was done.    As far as food, this was an amazing meal.  The pork chops are misdescribed on the menu...they are WAY better!!!!  The hot mustard with the teriyaki style sauce paired so well together.  Chops were cooked perfectly...the vegis were fresh and cooked perfectly.   I was honestly very surprised at the taste and freshness.. I will be back.<//Review><user>110906760469389003285<//user><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

When I'm in need of comfort food, one of my favorite things to do is head to Karl Strauss (or order delivery) to eat Tree Hugger mac n cheese, paired with a Red Trolley ale. The mac n cheese has red peppers and broccoli AND kale nestled among a nest of wonderful cheese sauce, large elbow macaroni, and blanketed by a crispy breadcrumb topping. The presence of these vegetables helps me to feel that I am still reaping nutritional benefits along with the emotional benefits of this meal. The nutty Red Trolley is a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the pasta and has the ability to soothe mind and soul. Am I selling this too hard?
If you are here and thinking of throwing caution to the wind and ordering appetizers too, the duck fat pretzel bites are seriously delicious business. In the past, they had a black garlic fondue which was incredible and I hope it will return.
Last, dessert. I find that a number of breweries skimp on dessert (probably figuring that you've drunk enough of your calories already by that point, rude) but let me tell you about Chocolate on Tap. Brownies. Caramel sauce that had a dangerous liaison with Red Trolley. Vanilla bean ice cream. Whipped cream. It sounds like a variation on a standard dessert offering, right? Wrong. This is it, folks. This is what all those other "brownie with stuff" desserts are trying to be. I've even come here just for this dessert (with another Red Trolley, of course). Worth it every time.< /Review>

<Review>Food was above average. They nickel and dime everything it seems. I was charged 2.95$ for asking them to cut my burger in half. Never have I seen that before nor did they tell me it was an added charge. 2.95$ might seem insignificant, but so is cutting a burger in half. I could have done it myself had I known a charge would apply. Other than that the atmosphere was good and menu had a fair range of selections.</Review>< username>

This was our first time here and being from Seattle when I ordered the salmon I was wondering how it was going to be.  IT WAS GREAT, cooked correctly (it was still moist in the middle and nice and flaky.  Not over done). The overall look of the place was nice, especially the coy pond and the deck.  Was not too noisy and we could carry on a conversation without yelling at each other.

Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and took time to explain things.

Next time we are in San Diego we will be back.  Oh yes, their IPA was good, but still can't beat the Pacific NW IPA's</Review>

Pleasant place with a good selection of foods and, of course, beers. Parking can be a bit challenging at certain times and/or some days, but usually it can be found. Better have reservations during peak time. Place is noisy, but not overly so. Prices are reasonable< /Text>

Attended a pre-wedding dinner at this Brewery. It simply fantastic. Plenty of room for multiple party's. The layout is conducive to minimal distractions from your party. Employees were great and had everything handled.</review>

We were here to celebrate a birthday. Friendly and helpful waiter.  Also, great bartender.  However, the brunch buffet was just ok.  The presentation of some of the food was messy and often times certain dishes ran out quickly and we had to ask the waiters if they would/could replenish.  If someone from the restaurant was actively watching for that I would have given a higher rating.</review>

<review>Karl Strauss is always awesome....but this location's weekend brunch is amazing!! They have a great selection of food at the buffet, from an omelet bar, hot breakfast, sweet selection, savory selection, to a great fruit and dessert selection. Plus, who doesn't like bottomless mimosas or champagne? Their service is non stop as well; your drink is constantly being refilled. I take all my friend and family here when they come to visit me. Oh, and the view and atmosphere (small pond, Japanese style garden, and live music) are amazing!! Definitely recommend this place for weekend brunch.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Ok, so for starters, I absolutely love everything about Karl Strauss! They have an amazing atmosphere inside with a nice rustic touch and feel. The food is always amazing and well worth the price. Now, onto the beer, I have only had better once before in my life, and it's a VERY close call. I very, very highly recommend trying this place at least once and then you will see what I mean.< /Review>

Had our office holiday brunch here a couple of weekends ago. Good brunch menu! I didn't know they even did that. There was music, excellent spread of food, mimosas and obviously beer. Definitely recommend another trip back here.< /review>

Went for Sunday brunch all you can eat with bottomless mimosas. Wish it was bottomless beers or at least more than just a tasting flight though. Food was great, custom made to order omlettes, salad bar, desserts, smoked salmon, poke, tamales. Something fireveryone. Make a reservation though, it fills up super fast.< /text>

We went for a brunch on Sunday and it was a buffet style with unlimited refills on drinks. I think the food was good and there was a nice variety of breakfast and lunch items. There were also assistants preparing omlets, pasta dishes and cutting a roast. The food was good, but you could get much better for the price. It was also annoying you could not have champagne and mimosas at the same time, they make you 'trade in' your glass.</review>

<Review>This is a strange location, sort of hidden away in the middle of a business park. You're gonna think your GPS is screwing with you, but keep looking, you'll find it. Very nice Japanese themed patios wrapped around a koi pond. Perfect spot for outdoor dinner as the sun is setting in beautiful San Diego. This would be a great place for a date, but I came with a work colleague. I went with the swordfish which was great. Also, their beers are fantastic. Try the pale ale.</Review><Time>1537932402978</Time>< rating>

I frickin love this place. Fantastic table service and good food. You get the choice of a flight of beer, all you can drink mimosas or two beermosas. There's a great omelette bar and pasta bar. Definitely one of the better brunch places on Sunday< /text>

We had a wonderful brunch on a Sunday afternoon and walk through of the location with a detailed lay out of what would happen on the day of. The whole staff was just grate.
More recently I've visited there for a birthday party with a medium sized group and they were so fast to get our orders out and always asking if there was anything more we needed. They're just amazing.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dc0715da411f5b:0xca385eb992acebdb< /Gmap_id></record>

Four of us went here to celebrate a birthday because the food and service are always good and it's a lovely setting.

Our server was wonderful with just the right amount of attention. Others also checked in occasionally to make sure we were doing ok.
The food and drinks were all great and served promptly. All the staff were very friendly and attentive.

At the end of our meal our server brought out a very generous and delicious birthday sundae - along with four spoons, yes!
The friend who organized our lunch also brought a cake along with paper plates and forks (she called first to make sure this was allowed). Our server kindly brought out their plates and forks for us to use which was very thoughtful and appreciated.

We went thru the typical (for women) amount of mental gymnastics trying to discreetly calculate how to divide the check 3 ways with of course combinations of cash and credit cards. (The discreet part didn't last long, but the math was correct.) The server was patient throughout this exercise and somehow managed to bring back each check that matched our cards with the correct charge, well done!<//text>

Nice selection of beers. Waiters were really friendly and fast.
We ordered burgers and they came rather quick.
The only drawback is that it was a bit noisy.<//Review>

More affectionately known as building-k , this is the go to place for quick (after work ) get together (read important business meeting) with a group. the outdoor environment is very peaceful with a small pond and the surrounding landscape makes it a hidden gem. with  a variety of outdoor seating options. Red trolley is one of the favorite beer but they also offer  a lot of seasonal small batch beers. Thursday Cask nights are fun.</review>

Have not been there for a while. Food was decent. Won't be going there again and won't buy their beer due to them instituting the 3% screw employees for increased minimum wage fee. They wouldn't grandstand over rent or increased utilities but they will over the minimum wage. Just raise your prices. Don't screw all workers.<//review>

Came for brunch. Unlimited mimosas! This place has a good feel to it, the place is clean and the beer is good. The food is good but not super, selection is quite good and a lot to choose from. A Lot of parking spaces< /review>

Pleasant place with great food, great beer, really nice ambience and very attentive staff. The design is like a Japanese tea garden. Parking is free in an adjacent lot. I think you can park in the reserved spaces after 5. Try the red trolley to start. One of the tastiest brews on San Diego. The only drawback is that it is loud. That does not detract from it's 5 star rating. After all it is a brew pub. You can't go wrong here.</text>

But if you are very gluten sensitive (like me), there aren't many choices and the potential for being given the wrong dish or cross-contaminated food is high. My office goes there every few months for celebrations, I no longer eat the food due to too many poisonings and close calls.<//text>< username>

This place is tucked in the middle of an office center but surrounded by seclusive atmosphere. The brews are great and they are happy to let you taste to find your favorite. I have only tried two dishes: the Fish Tacos and the Fish and Chips. Both are pretty good. The staff were very attentive and firendly. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like beer.<//review>

This is a great place to experience lunch. The setting is a beautiful little building next to a great fish pond. The food was excellent and the service matched as well. The only downside is the parking. But the inconvenience is minimal compared to the peaceful setting to enjoy your meal< /Review>

In a middle of a office park, there is a brewery complete with a koi pond and a Japanese garden. The scenery is great and the food is gastropub fare.  Its very good.  Their beers are excellent as they have won numerous awards.  You did not have to know that as you would think these were high class.<//text>

<Review>Overpriced with a menu that's honestly just OK. If it's beer that you want, you're better off at one of the many tasting rooms in Mira Mesa/Sorrento. If it's food and beer, go grab a snack first, then hit one of the many aforementioned tasting rooms.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Nice little green oasis (complete with pond) in the midst of offices and light industrial buildings. Menu is pretty varied with some options for vegetarians. Food is plentiful and tasty. And of course they have a wide selection of beers in case you're not heading back to work (or driving) afterwards.<//text>

<Time>1547686854362<//Time><Rate>4<//Rate><review>This is a delicious brewery tucked into a bunch of business parks.  The Sunday buffet is what my family and I usually visit for.  The buffet has an omelet bar, fresh fruit, along with bottomless mimosas or one beer-mosa, and pretty little views with their Koi fish pond.  Depending on when you get there, Fish might be singing and playing his guitar by the pond and he's really fun.  The buffet is yummy, but always seems just shy of being great.  Can't put my finger one why, but overall I would say it is definitely a solid spoke. There is also a bar inside with lots of tap, heaters on the patio, big screen TVs for sports, and space to have larger parties.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_pLyj8YFF27uW76-NYdbCcjLgAPZ2jvNtaf-4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc0715da411f5b:0xca385eb992acebdb</GmapID></record>

Great for your business team because everyone can find something they'll like on the menu. It's a perfect length walk to/from the hotels.<//text>

Overpriced with a menu that's honestly just OK. If it's beer that you want, you're better off at one of the many tasting rooms in Mira Mesa/Sorrento. If it's food and beer, go grab a snack first, then hit one of the many aforementioned tasting rooms.<//Text>

My burger was great, and another beer tasting to pair with the burger.

Overall, excellent experience.< /review><user_id>108452479493540744126< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I do love this place and have for years. Although none of their beers is my favorite, they're all very good and they have something for everyone. Their food is creative and fantastic and pairs well with the beers. It doesn't hurt at all that they're literally across the street from my building at work!< /text>< Pics>

We have been coming to Karl Strauss for Sunday brunch for years. The brunch had a good selection of food and is very good. It is a little over priced but the ambiance makes up for it. The location seems like a business Park but you escape into an outdoor paradise with an amazing patio. Make reservations.<//Text>

A very chill place with live music on the weekend brunch. My family and myself enjoy it a lot. And unlimited refill on the champagne orange juicy is very good and the live pasta station is very attractive too!</Text>

The brunch buffet on Sunday is nothing short of memorable!! They have an omelette bar and a pasta bar where you tell them which ingredients you want in your dish and they make it to your liking. Waffles and topping and fruit are sooooo good. Love the unlimited mimosas included in the brunch price!!</text>

<Review>I've gone to this Karl Strauss for both dinner and Sunday Brunch. They have a great beer selection (if that's your thing). Wine is just a house red and white. The food is excellent and service has always been exceptional. Highly recommend going for brunch which is unlimited food with the option of bottomless mimosas or a beer I think. They have an omelet bar, pasta bar, roast beef cutting station, salads, shrimp, bagels and cream cheese with lox, regular bfast food, and some other fun foods. Beautiful space sits right next to a koi pond.<//Review>< gmapID>

<text>Best brunch in San Diego.  Brunch for 3 will run you approximately $80.00 but is well worth it.  Your brunch also includes a craft beer.  Outstanding choice for a Sunday morning.  Reservations are recommended< /text>< pictures>

Fresh beer, good service, decent menu that sometimes gets switched with special food and beer parings.

Nice place to escape to for an hour or so for lunch; recommend getting there by 11:20a (they open at 11a weekdays) for easy seating and faster service. There's a good reason a lot of local worker bees refer to this Karl's location as "building K" with a wink and a smile.</Text>

First off, let me just say that our server, Jon, was awesome. He was very knowledgeable and his recommendations were perfect. Every round of food we had he made sure to bring us a little sampler of beer that fit with the dish amazingly. As it was our first time here, I'm not sure if that's common place, but it was definitely a nice touch. Our food was fantastic! From the apps to the beeramisu, everything was great. My fiance and I decided to have our last meal here and it was not wasted. We will be making this our regular spot whenever we return to San Diego. Thank you for a wonderful meal and please make sure that Jon knows he did a great job!</Review>

If you haven't been to this location, beware that it is not the easiest to find at night. The grounds are beautiful and serene though, with a man made lake and fountain outside. Decent service, but I'd say the food is better than the beer (personal opinion). Restaurant was clean and inviting.<//text>

Good food, great scenery and polite staff. Oh and beer. Food is different and mixes international dishes together, so each meal is original and also maybe a gamble. Everything is pretty good though, just maybe a little strange sounding at first. Definitely a place where you try new things.<//review>

Karl Strauss is a wonderful place. Great beer and food, and an absolute beautiful setting. It's a great venue for private events like weddings and holiday parties etc. There are a dozen or so Karl Strauss  beers plus some guest taps/ collaboration beers. I've been here many times, and I'll be back many more</review>

Excellent Sunday Brunch,  if it has the name Karl Strauss then it better be great. Service is outstanding,  food was well presented,  warm and savory. A gem for locals. Setting is very welcoming and peaceful. Karl Strauss takes excellent care of its San Diego natives.</Text>

<review>Excellent Sunday Brunch,  if it has the name Karl Strauss then it better be great. Service is outstanding,  food was well presented,  warm and savory. A gem for locals. Setting is very welcoming and peaceful. Karl Strauss takes excellent care of its San Diego natives.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5</rating><text>I've been once before for brunch and it was fantastic (food, Mimosas and atmosphere on point), but tonight my husband and I celebrated our 4 year anniversary and our Waiter, Zach was simply amazing! Not only was he a great waiter, but he made our anniversary one to remember! Just chiming in, making us laugh, and going above and beyond to make our evening absolutely perfect! So glad we decided to go to Karl Strauss tonight, because I don't think any other brewery had a "Zach" to make our night so special. Cheers, Zach and Karl Strauss!< /text>< Pics>

Each of the specialty burgers is crafted for a unique flavor and all of them are in my top 10 list. I highly recommend the Big Beer Burger which features a variety of beer-accented toppings and is overall delicious.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dc0715da411f5b:0xca385eb992acebdb< /gmapID></record>

Good food, great scenery and polite staff. Oh and beer. Food is different and mixes international dishes together, so each meal is original and also maybe a gamble. Everything is pretty good though, just maybe a little strange sounding at first. Definitely a place where you try new things.<//text>

<Review>Beautiful outdoors, with the Koi pond and Japanese decor. But also great food and drinks.  if you go on a Wednesday and make sure you try the meatloaf it's amazing. And they only serve it on Wednesdays. The drunken Cioppino is amazing and so is their mac and cheese probably the best I've ever had</Review>< Pictures>

A person trying to keep their reservation would never make it. You have to drive all over Kingdom Come to find it and then you're blocked off by construction.  So, you walk into a nearby business to ask how to get to Karl Strauss and find out you have to drive AROUND the entire complex to enter from the other side. There is plenty of signage for the brewery but I never found it. I was very frustrated after driving circles in 2 parking lots. AND I was so looking forward to the calamari salad. Sorry, Karl Strauss,  I even called twice for help. You lose, Karl😠</review>

I don't drink so this is just to review the food and location.  They have a surprisingly classy menu that you would normally expect to be done very simple.  High quality takes on nachos, burgers, and my favorite - the club sandwich.  It's a great spot to meet up with people in the area, and a good looking spot with plenty of indoor or outdoor seating.  The parking can sometimes be tricky at peak hours.< /Review>

The chicken was delicious he absolutely loved his pork chops and the Terra massu was the perfect  ending to a fun evening.

I've been a few times now and really like this location.

All of the Karl Strauss locations have great beer and pretty consistent food.
What sets this one apart is its great service and atmosphere. The servers are on their game and know how to have a great time!

I believe Karl Strauss bought out this location from a Benihana that wasn't doing too well, which would explain the Japanese influence in setting.

Worth a visit! I only wish they would stay open a bit later on weeknights.< /review>

You just can't go wrong with this choice. Watching the koi is so peaceful. Food is always delicious. One ding, however, is the noise level inside. We moved to a table outside.</Text>

<user>100750927277108706405<//user><review>I was here on January 2nd, 2017 at around 19:00 after my friend decided to have some beer with dinner. There were plenty of seats as it was a Tuesday. We were seated inside, even though there were plenty of seats outside since it was too cold for my friend. They do have heaters if you do seat outside though. Our server was nice, he guided us to order on our menu and told us what was the special item of the month.
I ordered the home grown burger tonight since I was craving for some beef. My 2 friends who were hungry ordered burgers to. They also ordered buffalo wings and the jalapenos. My other friend drank one beer too until the server kept saying that it is a Tuesday night and smiling while asking for another order of a beer.
The food was great. My beef patty was just right and juicy, the bread was fresh and the veggies were good except for the tomato piece. The tomato piece was fresh, but I did not like the piece that came with the sandwich because it was a hard piece. The fries were crunchy. My friend who had the chips also liked it. I tried a piece and it was crispy. I also liked the buffalo chicken appetizer since it was boneless. The jalapeno was good tasting, had cheese inside, but pricey for what it is. It is almost as much as a burger. My friend liked 2 out of the 3 beers he tried.
The service here was great. They refilled our water and cleared the appetizer plates in time to make room for the burgers. They even gave us a whole jug of water which we did not use and there were free beer samples that they offered tonight. But my friend and I decided to pass on free beer because for me, I rarely consume alcohol and my friend had a New Year's resolution of not drinking beer. I can say the beer is pretty good since most of my friends who have been here liked it.
This is a great place for people to relax after work, eat good dinner and sip on some beers. But for people like me who do not drink, I do find prices to be a bit on the high end. My homegrown burger cost me $14.95 and the Jalapeno appetizer cost almost $10. I had a great experience here and recommend it for those who want a drink on Thursday-Saturday night.<//review>< Name>

Went for Sunday brunch. Unique selection of food. Poke was more like a salsa with some tuna in it. All the breakfast items were good. Waited way to long for a slice of meat and there was only two of us standing there. The koi pond and the live musician would be why I might come back.</review>

The setting is really great, in spite of being in an office park. It's surrounded by a nice Japanese garden and has a large Koi pond. The food is really good. We had garlic fondue for our appetizer and I had a delicious mac and cheese. The beer, I had Red Trolley, was also great.

Definitely recommend this spot!</text>

<Review>Good food, long wait. We went at lunch time but it wasn't a full house. Everything took a long time. Long time to get water, to get beers tasters, to get food then half of our food came out 10 minutes before the rest of it. Lunch took over 90 minutes and it was just sandwiches and salads. I still gave it 4 stars because the ambiance, the koi pond, and although the food took forever it was very tasty. Don't go when you are on a time crunch and know you likely won't find parking in their lot during regular working hours since it is in between 2 office buildings.<//Review>< pics>

<user_name>Marc Furlong<//user_name><Review>Karl Strauss in Sorrento Valley can not be beat for a business lunch and a beer. This location has primarily outdoor seating (with plenty of heaters for cool days or nights) and despite being in the middle of a huge corporate park, feels like eating by a lake in the woods.

The food is standard Karl Strauss brew pub fare, which is to say it's really good but not exceptional.

Definitely a recommended lunch or happy hour restaurant.<//Review>< response>

The beer is very good, the food was surprising, and the Japanese garden and koi pond really put the cherry on top. Reasonably priced with plenty of outdoor seating with heaters. Highly recommended.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Here on business and wanted something not out of the box (chain restaurant). Google didn't disappoint with this gem hidden off the path a bit. Great food, amazing beer and amazing service. Only gripe was the bun but that didn't stop me from giving it the elusive 5 star rating. Need to relax by a koy pond, great food and enjoy amazing beer, you found your destination.< /Review>

We come for lunch every now and again because we work near by. The food is okay. My real complaint is that no matter what I order (pork chop to cioppino) my stomach is upset to varying degrees all afternoon. That and the price point. If I'm going to have a $20-$30 lunch I just expect more. I'm not a beer​ person​, so I can't speak to their beverages.</Text>

Seriously delicious beer and food. I love that you can sample the beer before you order so you don't end up with something that is not to your taste. And my toddler loves the koi pond!<//review>

We come here quite often because it's so close to work.  Anyway, I have yet to find a dish I don't like here and the beers are pretty decent.  Everything is pretty good for a brewery/restaurant.  The Japanese garden/pond really elevates the atmosphere.  Never had an issue with the service either.

The place can be a tad tricky to find (located within an industrial park) but just follow the signs!  Warning:  It can get very busy here even on the weekdays.  There are very few bars in this area so everyone comes here for happy hour.</text>

<Name>Ryan Jellison< /Name><review>This place is really beautiful as it has a large koi pond as you walk in.  It would be a great place to bring a date. I often get their pork chops as they give you 2 and their glaze is delicious.  This time I got their October fest special which was schnitzel sliders  and they were amazing.  Price is in the high teens for most dishes.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating><GmapID>0x80dc0715da411f5b:0xca385eb992acebdb</GmapID>< pics>

<text>Atmosphere was great with the koi pond in the middle of a corporate area. I'm not a big red trolley ale fan, but that being said, Karl Strauss has a very good selection of beers that they produce. During my meal I had the hazy IPA, and the mosaic session IPA. Also, I would highly recommend the blackened mahi mahi fish tacos, which were excellent! Will be coming back next time I am in the area.</text><Name>Brandon Pena</Name></record></dataset><record>

Yesterday's visit prompted me to write this review since we went in for a few drinks our waitress Loretta was very nice and laughed with our jokes. She would bring us sample shots of different beer to try and as a big courtesy which she didn't have to do for us she provided us with a free dessert and a taste beer that complimented the dessert very well. Thank you!!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I think this used to be a Japanese restaurant because of the beautiful,  large koi pond. This is a hidden treasure! Quiet and relaxing.  Food was great..service a little slow being that it wasn't that busy but we weren't in a hurry that day.</text>

Was here for a group event, location was great, service was excellent, staff was very attentive and cheerful. Great beer selection. The food was very good, boneless chicken wings for a work event was a thoughtful consideration.   The only thing was that the calamari we got that night was a bit fishy. The other appetizers were all very well received.

Overall, great place for a work gathering.<//review>

<text>I really really like this restaurant, the atmosphere is beautiful with dinners out side sitting next to a giant koe pond, and the inside furnished nicely.
The food is really good, and the beer is great.

Pick up a growler and take some of their beer home.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Went there last night for dinner for the first time, I had the flat iron steak and my wife had the fish and chips. Both were delicious. Oh yeah, the appetizer was really scrumptious too, spinach dip with tortilla chips. Took a walk throught the Japanese garden afterward, what a beautiful setting.< /review>

THE San Diego original. Have loved their beer long before SD was a microbrewery hub. And their restaurants are phenom on their own irrespective of their brewing credentials!< /review>

Can't say enough, what a great place. We just found it off the map. It was excellent, you won't regret a visit. As we were eating dinner the waitress brought out several beer samples for us to try.<//text>

<Text>I like the happy hour here as they have a good beer selection along with good food. The fries and boneless buffalo wings are my favorites. They serve their own selection of beers here (being a brewery and all). They range from IPAs to stouts to a couple of their seasonals. Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Love many things about this place. They have great beer, the service has always been friendly and prompt, and they have amazing food. If you have the chance, you HAVE to stop in for Brunch on Sunday.< /review>

Atmosphere was nice. Live music wasn't very good. Apparently the kitchen was closed on Sunday when we went so there was a buffet only option and the food was mediocre at best. Not sure what it's like on a weekday but waiting for 25 min on a Sunday for brunch the sampling the mandatory buffet was sorely disappointing. Don't waste the calories.</review>

Really great place to have drinks

But reserve table ahead if you are going after 5pm

Typical waiting time after 5 is about an hour</review>

It's decent enough food, decent enough beer, nice scenery. Mostly the corporate crowd, but better here than Chili's.

If you need to bring your business casual cow-orkers someplace mildly interesting, this is a decent enough venue.< /Text>

I really really like this restaurant, the atmosphere is beautiful with dinners out side sitting next to a giant koe pond, and the inside furnished nicely.
The food is really good, and the beer is great.

Pick up a growler and take some of their beer home.< /Review>

We came here for lunch today to catch up with an old friend now living in New York. My wife and I had not dined here since 2004 when we were visiting from Australia. It looks like the place has had a makeover since then. It was packed to the rafters but we managed to get a good table for 6 on the high level looking down to the bar. Everyone enjoyed their food but because it was a work day lunch no one was drinking alcohol. Nice atmosphere with the huge Koi pond greeting you at the entrance. Obviously being in the heart of a business district with huge companies like Qualcomm next door keeps the pub pretty flat out.</text>

Tucked away location,  this venue is the nicest of the local karl strauss brew pubs due to its outdoor seating area next to a koi pond.  Fresh beers on tap with good happy hour choices.  Great for groups</Review>

Bottomless mamosas, coffee, or a flight of tasters. $80 for three people, but since it wasn't busy we were able to hang out and snack for about 3 hours. Wonderful way to spend a Sunday morning.<//text>

Amazing food and good happy hour deals! A bit loud if you want to have a conversation, but fun, lively vibe. The one at Sorrento Beach has an awesome koi pond!<//text>

Great casual atmosphere, lots of different brews to sample and even really good food. They close at 9 pm weekdays, a fun after work spot.</Review>

< Review>
A great spot for dinner or drinks.

The food: The menu is big and you can get anything from a salad, to burgers, to fish and chips. It is your basic gastro-pub menu. Something for everyone.

The beer: They only serve Karl Strauss beers. You won't find as many of the RnD stuff that you'll find at their PB location, but there are plenty of great beers to choose form. I usually opt for the Mosaic session ale.

The location: Its crowded, and there is usually a line. The place itself recently got a makeover that added more tables and a more open layout. We usually ask to sit next to the pond so we can enjoy the weather and watch the fish.< /Review>

Pork belly sandwich was super delicious. Ask for extra napkins since it's a bit messy but it's definitely worth getting your fingers dirty for that yummy meal.</Text>

It's colloquially referred to by the Qualcomm employees that visit it often as "Building K", and has a great happy hour on weekdays.  Their food is great and the service never disappoints either.  In terms of craft beers, these guys are on point, and their style isn't just the generally over-hopped San Diego norm.  The Japanese style gardens surrounding this place are really nice as well and make it a great destination to book for special events like wedding receptions.</text>

Good food and beautiful setting outside. Fun to try the rotating beers - be sure to check the board, not just the menu! It does get VERY loud here - so keep that in mind if conversation is important to you.<//Review>

OMG what a great "hidden treasure"   Great service from my phone call before driving up to checking on hours and wait time, to check in and tableside servers keeping my Mimosa glass to the brim and musing about the great spread.
The guitarist set mod pond kept the tunes flowing playing homage to Jack Johnson, The Stoens, Paul Simon and many more amidst the sound the rushing waterfall.
Every seat is fantastic so dont fear.if they say seating is only available inside because the windows roll.up and bring the best of the pond and music to your ears
We will be back!!!!< /text>

If you need beer, you can buy beer here. Even if you don't need beer, you can still buy it here. Especially on Fridays. It costs less to fill growlers on Fridays.<//review>

Aurora Hoppyalis IPA and Boat Shoes IPA will please the most discerning hopheads.  The Sorrento Mesa location is an oasis (with a huge koi pond) embedded in the midst of  a high-tech (think Qualcomm) office community.  Solid food menu and good service.< /text>< pictures>

They make a fantastic brown ale BBQ sauce to go with burgers and fries. Also tried the West Coast Carbonara, which looked very unappetizing at first glance, but tasted great. Huge fan of the Wreck Alley Imperial Stout</text>

One of the best brunches in San Diego. Great Japanese garden ambience. Normally closed Saturdays for special events. The only buffet I've been to that has poké. Omelet bar. Your choice of endless mimosas or two of their beer-mosas. And tv's!! So you can catch the morning games or the beginning of the afternoon games during football season!<//Review>

This brewery is tucked away behind all of the Qualcomm buildings so its not the easiest to find. There is a beautiful koi fish pond which is awesome to look at. Their cheddar burger is fantastic and it comes with the option of getting seasoned fries. On Fridays they have an 8 dollar growler fill special.<//Text>

This review is about their Sunday brunch which is $25. The food is delicious especially the spinach dip. They have a pretty decent selection. The servers are usually really nice.

Try the hefmosa instead of a regular mimosa. It is orange juice and hefeweizen.<//Review>

Popular lunch spot for local office parks. Tucked away from the street and a bit hard to spot. The restaurant is set around a koi pond and garden. Free beer sample with your meal.<//text>

Great beer, adequate food + service, lush and peaceful environment. Would definitely go again but isn't good enough to become a regular (it's also a little hard to locate if you haven't been there before as it's almost designed like a hobbit hole).<//text>

<Text>One of the best brunches in San Diego. Great Japanese garden ambience. Normally closed Saturdays for special events. The only buffet I've been to that has poké. Omelet bar. Your choice of endless mimosas or two of their beer-mosas. And tv's!! So you can catch the morning games or the beginning of the afternoon games during football season!</Text>< gmap_id>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I write  this as I pay my bill at Karl Strauss. We were a party of 5, served by Sara. Oh what an experience. More than 3 years a regular at this place. We had to move our office happy hours to Thursday as bldg K as we call it, stopped happy hour pricing on Fridays. Not that we don't go there outside happy hours but it's good to save a couple of dollars while we cokntinue to patronize our bldg K. Now we ordered our drinks and as it was served, I asked for another round as we are nearing 6pm, the time when happy hour pricing ends. Sara refuses, saying we first have to drink what has been served before ordering the next round of drinks. Weird. Your proximity to Qualcomm has got to your head now Bldng K. I think we might just move to Green Flash. I am so pissed at you, and I am not even drunk. Karl Straiss, you better up your game!<//Text>< response>

< Review>
Fun location with great beer.   Nice koi pond and outdoor seating.  "Fear the Tart" is awesome with characteristics right out of Brussels. Aurora and Big Barrel IIPA also good.  Unfortunately the German style beers were not true to style. Kölsch was overly astringent and hefeweizen was too light with a mango flavor rather than banana or cloves.<//Review>

The  spinach artichoke dip with the buffalo wings are both highly recommended.  The ahi tuna and the carving stations are both solid.  If you like beer and good food you need to try Karl Strauss.</review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Colloquially known as bldg K, this spot is known by all Qualcommers and others in the Sorrento Valley area. Awesome landscaping with outdoor seating. They close sort of early, but understandably so as it's in the middle of an office park.<//text>

Great beer, adequate food + service, lush and peaceful environment. Would definitely go again but isn't good enough to become a regular (it's also a little hard to locate if you haven't been there before as it's almost designed like a hobbit hole).</review>

Service is slow and frustrating. Music is too loud to have a conversation yet no one is dancing. Food is not worth the wait or price. Every beer they brew has the same terrible after taste. Beer selection is garbage unless you like IPAs, their selection is 80% IPA. Last time I ever go here, too many negatives, nothing positive.< /review>

< review>
Been to too many breweries, good beer and food but service is by far the worst when compared to ballast point and stone. For the past 4 times I've visited, I've felt nothing but bad service. In other words, ignored.
On this last visit.

1) they got my order wrong. I ordered a blta with extra meat (chicken)
2) they took the salad back and brought back chicken that was not even warmed up but pre grilled and chilled. I was definitely expecting something a bit more toasty to match the pork belly on the salad.
3) lastly I mainly felt ignored. They were rarely any servers in our area (the dock) and I felt like me and my fiance had to forcefully ask other servers to place our orders. We spoke to 4 different employees who served us tonight.

I am seriously going to stop giving this place a chance and continue to go to the places that truly appreciate their customers with excellent service. Bye bye Karl Straus Sorrento Valley 👋👋</review>

Been to too many breweries, good beer and food but service is by far the worst when compared to ballast point and stone. For the past 4 times I've visited, I've felt nothing but bad service. In other words, ignored.
On this last visit.

1) they got my order wrong. I ordered a blta with extra meat (chicken)
2) they took the salad back and brought back chicken that was not even warmed up but pre grilled and chilled. I was definitely expecting something a bit more toasty to match the pork belly on the salad.
3) lastly I mainly felt ignored. They were rarely any servers in our area (the dock) and I felt like me and my fiance had to forcefully ask other servers to place our orders. We spoke to 4 different employees who served us tonight.

I am seriously going to stop giving this place a chance and continue to go to the places that truly appreciate their customers with excellent service. Bye bye Karl Straus Sorrento Valley 👋👋<//text>

<Review>How can I put this nicely: KSBG is Stone's ugly older sister. Do you enjoy second-rate "craft" beer? Do you relish being constantly told to move, just because you had the audacity to order beer (and not food) AT A BREWERY? If so, this is the place for you! Unlike at Stone, where you can actually buy a pint and walk around the garden, at KSBG you're a virtual leper unless you wait for a table and order food. The famed Japanese garden consists of little more than a pond and a decorated hillside, and you'll most likely be stuck sitting inside their nondescript restaurant, or standing uncomfortably in the spaces between tables near their bar. I've got to hand it to Karl though, he really knows how to pack in the North County office park folk. Overall, the experience is about as much fun as crashing someone else's office happy hour.< /Review>< pics>

<date>1482369057177<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Have been going for the past 7 years. Great micro brewery with red trolley, imperial stout, tower 10 ipa being their best ones in my opinion. Good appetizers to go with the beer menu. The tabouli and melon salad is pretty good. Lots of great options in the main course including the veggie burger, drunken cioppino, spicy tofu curry etc.

Overall a great microbrewery to try out in the budding brewery scene of san diego.< /review>< pictures>

The naming reason for Building K is, Qualcomm has 50+ buildings around Sorrento Valley and they are named with alphabets like Q, A, B, W etc,  this is regular happy hour place for Qualcommers and hence this is also considered as one of the building of Qualcomm and we affectionately call Karls Strauss as Building K

This place is like an oasis from urban life. Within a seemingly random office space estate, hides a beautiful Japanese themed architecture. There is a large koi pond. If you sit next to it, be careful about losing things into the pond. There was evidence of forks, knives, etc on the pond floor.

Food: we came for the 25 dollar all you can eat brunch. Scheduling said we wouldn't be able to get a table because reservations were full (this was over the phone). We showed up anyway and were seated right away. The breakfast buffet included an omelette bar, various international breakfast foods, desserts, and a prime rib station. All of the food was delicious.

Beer: included in the 25 dollar deal was a choice of beer flight, bottomless mimosas, 2 beer-mosas, or non-alcoholic beverages. I had the beer flight. It included their Oktoberfest, Windansea, red trolley ale (bonus), and a couple others that were too hoppy for my tastes. The 3 that I named were absolutely delicious and paired well with mostly all the breakfast foods, especially the meats. I went and bought some red trolley afterwards. My girlfriend ordered the beer-mosas which turned out to be an excellent choice. I believe they mixed the Windansea and a mimosa.

All of this was amazing. Come, eat, drink, enjoy!<//review>

< Review>
Solid selection of beer and even a couple hard seltzer. Everything was open and easy to navigate in covid times. Staff was very helpful. Location and scenery was surprisingly awesome. Food was somewhat innovative and inclusive but still falls in the average category. Only other thing I found odd is I could get a 6 pack of boat shoes cheaper at the Walmart food store than at the actual brewery. Overall a great experience that I look forward to trying again after covid lockdown.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant where you can enjoy craft beer and meals that match beer. Beware that there are many types of beer and the volume of each beer is large. You can drink everything from IPA to ale. It is recommended to select with reference to the bitterness IBU and alcohol content.
