<Text>I was just in to get my sandwiches and although it was very busy your girls did a great job in getting everyone's order out in a timely matter.  Especially Destiny, she is always friendly and very personable to her customers besides being good at making the sandwiches.

<Review>Poor quality costumer service.
Order a chicken melt sandwich. Bread was sliced wrong. Veggies not fresh. A girl making didn’t look like she wanted to be there. Flies where inside the shop. Landed on sandwich when she was making it. No hair nets,  as when I was biting on to my sandwich I almost swallowed a long brown woman’s hair.<//Review><name>Cecy regalado</name></record>

I don’t believe that it is very professional to yell at one of your workers but especially a new worker who is new to your team and can be crucial to keeping up your reputation.  zero stars!< /Review>< Pictures>

Where shall I begin, the moment I walked in I was meet with a shallow and disingenuous “How was your day”. I decided to get the #1, Ham Salami Capicolla, Pepperoni and Provolone. I waited for my sandwich to be made, but as I waited I realized no progress was made on my sandwich or my husbands sandwich. They decided to prioritize online orders over the attention of there in person customers. I waited until the manager emerged from the back. He threw my sandwich together and wasn’t even aware of who it was for. I had to tell him it was for me after he looked around the store in confusion for 5 whole minutes.< /Text>

David the owner and his crew have this place spot on. slicing the meat in front of you is a plus..
(it’s also a workout) ...they have a special of the day, be sure to ask about that. i love the brownies that a lil plus in my book..again if you haven’t tried POS it’s well worth it..

Absolutely the best sandwiches ever. They cut the meat fresh as you order it so unlike other sandwich places it's not sitting out getting dried out. Their bread is fresh as is all the extras. Their staff is the friendlest they are ready to make your your order just the way you want it. The place is spotless clean even the restrooms, and that says alot about a place. You will even find the owner and his wife hard at work. Yes I highly recommend this place.</text>

Good food and good customer service! I have ordered here twice and both times have messed up my order. Made a steak burrito I paid for chicken and the second time forgot my dressing for the salad and had to drive all the way back. Just check your order before you leave :)<//Text>

Not impressed. The quality of their food has gone down. I used to love this place and hadn't been since the pandemic began. We tried it again and was not really happy with the flavor of the food and our orders were not correct. 1 star only!<//Text>

I come to this special restaurant many times since I enjoy the good mood that is part of this restaurant. The team is highly loving and experienced. The service is impressively efficient. Most important, the food you get is excellent. I frequent often and I was never disappointed. The cost is reasobable. I suggest this place to all my friends.<//review>

I think overall the place is great but there is a serious insect fly problem that has been getting worse every 2 or 3 weeks we revisit. There are tiny flies all over the fountain drink are and in the patio have huge flies everywhere. This time it was so bad we found a tiny fly in my wife's drink and I was just so grossed out by all the flies I didn't finish my food and threw it away.

If they address the fly problem I'd rate them higher but its gotten to a point where I just don't want to eat there anymore.<//text>

I enjoyed the food. I could have used a bit more meat in my order. I had mostly beans. Otherwise, the customer service was good.<//Text>

<Text>This place (Mission Viejo location off Alicia) used to be very pleasant. The previous manager, Faustino, was always professional and friendly. It has gone down hill since he left (or was relocated to another store? Not sure). The 2 women who were taking orders were both miserable. Zero customer service skills. One in particular (Blanca) was so rude that she even argued with me, and over something that was actually listed on the board behind her. I'm disappointed because this used to be one of our favorite places to go. Not anymore.<//Text><Time>1567290103652<//Time><gmap_id>0x80dce919c3a43927:0xdaf2e586ac4e1eb6< /gmap_id><Rating>2< /Rating>< response>

<text>The place is a little inconsistent when it comes to food taste and quality. When we come here on a busy Sunday afternoon the food tastes amazing. Try the steak enchiladas and charbroiled fish platter they are delicious. But during the weekdays when we order take out, the food tasted stale, dried out meat and over seasoned. This happened multiple times when we order take out. So I would recommend you dine in on a weekend for the best possible food.< /text><user>106862931212764330157</user>< Name>

Baja Fresh doesn't keep a microwave, freezer, or can opener in any of its 300 Plus locations including this one in the Gateway Center. This Cali Mex chain prides itself on preparing everything from a half-dozen salsas to the marinated hormone-free meats fresh on-site. Recommend the Chicken Torta, Chicken Baja Ensalada with salsa verde, Carnitas Tacos, and Shrimp Soft Tacos.< /review>

<review>Baja Fresh is better than Chipotle. I said it, it's true, the food is infinitely better.  Chipotle is the Subway sandwiches of food pretending to be Mexican.

If you like subway, I'm sorry.  I can't help you.

If you like Chipotle, you should love Baja Fresh.</review>< time>

< Review>
I love Murrieta Day Spa! I have been a fan for over 20 years. You can have services, relax in the mineral pool, enjoy the garden, and have lunch with a delightful cocktail! It can be difficult to get an appointment so plan ahead. A gift card is the perfect gift for men and women! They even offer packages for special occasions that include several services for a day of pampering to make that special someone feel like queen/king for a day!< /Review>

They offer plenty of great spa treatments on their menu. Depending on the month they have affordable month specials which do not disappoint. Their staff is down to earth and very professional. I have been coming here for years and I have never had a bad experience. They also offer couples massage. I’ve seen guys in here too with their significant other just in case your guy is a little shy to go to a spa. They have a hair salon, a small mineral pool, a the best part they sell alcoholic beverages 😱 oh my! They place is always clean and well kept. Their outdoor sitting area is amazing, they added private cabanas for rental as an added bonus to their already gorgeous backyard. I usually get there early enough before my treatments and enjoy lunch and a drink by the pool. It’s amazing! 👍<//review><Rating>5< /Rating>< UserId.>

Go see Annie in the salon! She is the best hair stylist I have ever gone to. When I leave the salon I’m feeling SO fine. I go in to get highlights and trims. Her massages while you’re getting your hair washed are to die for. Amazing stylist. Even better company.< /Text>

We came on a Saturday and there was a large bachelorette party at one of the cabanas next to us. Multiple people were throwing up at the cabana and in the bathrooms (that party and others). Understandably staff were busy dealing with everything going on, but our cabana service was terrible. Our server was super sweet, but we had to ask multiple times for almost everything. The food was sup-par and pretty expensive and nothing was worth what we were paying. Definitely won't be back< /review>

Best place to get a facial or massage in murrieta. Never have any issues with booking or scheduling appointments. I have been a spa member for years and look forward to my facial every month. They have late appointments on Thursdays to accomodate different schedules</review>

<Text>Wonderful Oasis in historic downtown Murrieta! Great staff, wonderful services, spartan but stellar food and beverage selection, very relaxing and accommodating atmosphere, accessible, and extremely pristine environment!

First time coming here. I would definitely come back. Had a quick pedicure done. The girl I had did a great job. The place looked super cute & clean. Looking forward to coming back and having a massage and soaking in the mineral pool that they have.< /Review>

Enjoyed spending my birthday here, the staff were amazingly nice. My massage and facial were amazing, the lunch was delicious. The atmosphere was just relaxing overall. The staff gives you enough space to relax on your own but still ensure that you’re taken care of. I will definitely be coming back.< /review>

Lovely atmosphere. Great amenities.
Great place to meet-up with friends for a relaxing day at the Spa.  They have food, a pool to lounge around.  They even offer rental space for special events.<//Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because of the manicure. Paid $49 dollars for a manicure that the nail polish came off several nail within three days. So upset, I have had several manicures and the polish lasted almost two weeks and only cost $30 so will never get another manicure here or recommend for anyone else too.
Now the facial massage was wonderful , relaxing and I will do that again.
The staff was very professional and courteous.
My name is Patti Schmidt and I was from out of town. When I go back I will definitely get a facial but for a manicure nope not recommend.< /text>< userid>

We spent a lovely day at the spa as a gift and I received a Swedish massage from Patsy. She was so amazing and felt what I needed was a bit of a therapeutic massage on my neck and shoulders after assessing me. Her voice was so calming and limited talking to when it was necessary. I would absolutely recommend her when you go to Murrieta Day Spa</text>

Murrieta Day Spa, what a great place.

Well, my wife actually talked me into giving this place a try. I’m glad I did.

This place is great and has a very relaxing atmosphere. The place is clean, well kept, the staff is polite and professional. The food and beverages from the Cafe are also very good.

I go there primarily for massages for my legs that were injured before retiring. Because of these injuries I’ve had to use a cane since 1992 to walk around and was always in extreme pain and couldn’t get a decent nights sleep. But that’s not the case anymore.

Thanks to Kira this has now changed. I have been treated by Kira for the last few months and now for the first time in years I have been able to walk around with minimal use of my cane for a change which is great. I am also sleeping better now because my knees, legs and left ankle are not hurting me like they used to. With her help it’s improved my outlook on my day to day life by being more mobile with minor pain for a change.

She cares about what she does, she is very patient with my mobility/ movement issues with my legs, she is very motivating/supportive and she is a really wonderful person.

Thank you Kira for making a difference.

<Review>My husband purchased a gift card for me and I am so thankful. I have had several massages there as well have enjoyed lounging around by the pool and enjoying some food and wine. They even serve cocktails. I just love the relaxing feeling I have when I am here. I look forward to enjoying some of the other services here in the near future. I would highly recommend Murrieta Day Spa as a place that you have to experience.<//Review>< response>

Murrieta Day Spa is my favorite place! The staff is so welcoming and all of the technicians are amazing at what they do! I have enjoyed many of their services, the spa amenities, eaten at their bistro, and attending events there. Each time is a great experience. If you are looking to enjoy a spa day- This is the place to go! Cant wait to enjoy my birthday there!<//text>

I've loved it here every time I've visited. Everyone is so personable ad professional. The services are outstanding and the grounds are like your own Shangri-La right here in Our own backyard.

A perfect afternoon or full day escape. Go by yourself for complete relaxation or gather your friends. Just do yourself a little favor and go!!<//text>

Loved the atmosphere. Very warm and inviting. Everyone was very helpful and friendly.

Had a massage and it was absolutely wonderful. Enjoyed relaxing outside by the pool with a glass of wine and a delicious salad.

Looking forward to going back again!</review>

This place is wonderful! I loved the treatment for my deep-tissue massage and the ambiance of the spa. I will definitely plan to stay half the day next time to relax, enjoy the pool area more and have some lunch! Communication with scheduling could be improved.</review>

My experience was bad from the day of making the appointment!  Please keep in mind that this was my first time and I knew nothing about the facility and it's amenities. I called 2 weeks prior to set the appointment and scheduled a pedicure and a Swedish massage.  We set the time to be 1:00 for the Message and 2:00 for the pedicure. My appointment was for Thursday, on Monday I get a call from someone telling me that the lady that was going to do my pedicure had retired that day, on Monday, and that I could not get my pedicure until 4:30 on Thursday.  I told her that my message was at 2:00 and she said "well you can just HANG OUT here till 4:30".  First of all I don't have time to "HANG OUT" and wait for my appointment.  After 15 minutes of going back and forth and being put on hold for a period of time she came back and said she could do the pedicure at 1:30 and the message at 4:30 and I could hang out and wait for my for my message....this girl just didn't get it!!!  Finally  she said she could do my pedicure at 1:30 and my message at 2:30 which I agreed to.  On Wednesday a get a call to confirm my appointments for Thursday and the girl told me she had me down for 1:00 for the pedicure and 2:00 for the message....REALLY!!!! GET IT TOGETHER!!!!  I had my message with Kinsey and she was great!!!  I had my pedicure with Coleen and it was the worst pedicure I have ever had!!! She never shut up the whole time she was doing the pedicure.  She did a terrible job cutting my toenails they are all uneven, she did not cut the cuticles around my toes, and let me tell you my 6 year old granddaughter could have done a better job painting my toenails!!  After the message I looked at how bad the polish looked and decided to complain, this was at 3:00.  I was told that no one could fix them until 4:30 or I could come back another time.  Finally the girl said that she could have someone fix them around 3:30 which I agreed to.  The girl that fixed the polish did an okay job.  They offered me a $20.00 gift card for my next visit, in my opinion they should have offered to give me a gift card for a free pedicure on my next visit.  By the way...there will never be  a "NEXT VISIT".  Don't waist your money!!!  This is supposed to be an upscale facility, they need to get people to work there that can provide the quality you would expect for the money you pay.</text>

Irene makes my face glow like no one else has and she starts by evaluating my face to see what it needs. Love the spa vibe and decor it’s so relaxing and it’s intimate.

I highly recommend you send your wife here or book an appointment for a massage .<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The 1-star is for the receptionist ' Nicole', who told me that I had to provide a credit card in order to book an appointment, she said that there are several people that 'no show' so I had to provide a card and she was borderline offensive when asking for the card. I have never pulled a no show, how about making a list of the people who do not show up for their appointments and when they try to book again ask them for a credit card. Tired of getting my credit card possibly compromised  because of other people behaviors and treated as if we are all guilty.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Went in for a massage and facial. Massage was ok, BUT MY FACIAL WAS AMAZING! My husband surprised me with a early Mother's Day gift card while we were visiting Ca from AZ for a few family emergencys and a funeral so I was very stressed. I am very grateful for the amazing expirence. Staff is sweet, professional and very clean which I loved. It's the perfect cozy day spa for anyone looking to relaxed somewhere beautiful, simple, classy and sweet. Highly recommend< /review>< pictures>

<date>1514031479087<//date><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>My son gifted me a full day spa; message, facial, pedicure and lunch. I scheduled my appt and was told I would be there from 10-1pm. So I got dropped off and started my spa day. Receptionist were ok, not over the top friendly or excited for you. I was taken back to change and started with my massage. OMG, best ever. I loved it! After I was taken back to the sitting room and figured I'd be called for my next treatment.  They found me in the hot sauna and my facial was good. I was taken back again to relax in the sitting room but was not told what and when was next. I waited 20 min and it was nearing 12:10 & still needed lunch and my pedicure. After not hearing from anyone I went and found a gal to see if I could start my pedicure as I had plans and was told I'd be done at 1. She did she'd handle it but after waiting 10 min I went to the front and asked them. They had no notes of me moving up my pedicure from the previous gal. I had lunch while getting my pedicure. All went well but I really wish the communication was better.  I was never told what to expect and just was left wondering what's next,  which is ok to some extent. I would have loved to have lunch in their little dining area instead of eating from my lap.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Good customer service. Okay selection- from pictures thought it would be bigger, BUT overall a good experience. It is a drive for us, so might not come every month/or two. But for a scenic drive and to look around 1-2 a year would be fine. If you are close or in area should visit.
Pricing is normal- 20/30% off retail. I love the tags- tells you if used or missing parts. Worth a look.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Make sure you check the electrical before you leave , cause all SALES are FINAL. Just a heads up. But I'll still shop at this and that. Need flooring ? This will be your one stop shop also.

You could go here every day and find something new.  Huge variety of items available.  Make sure you have the correct measurements and are sure about the item to install cause all sales are final.  The owners are great people and very easy to work with and talk to.<//review>

The staff is very helpful, efficient and friendly. The store is very clean and the merchandise is always changing. Sad that it is located in the old Calaveras Gold Gymnastics warehouse as we really miss that place.</Review>

Not one mask wearer except my family. No social distancing. Store was crowded, aisles are very close together, making it difficult to pass others. Navigation with a walker or wheelchair would be difficult.</Review>

As an employee here,I've seen the incredible savings to be had by just taking a stroll through our store. You may find exactly what you need at an excellent price compared to retail, or you may find exactly what you didn't know you needed but are glad you found< /review>

I have never quite had an Insurance broker like Ron Barr before. He is extremely detail oriented, efficient and went beyond the call of duty to help secure a new insurance policy for me where 4 other brokers just dropped the ball. He kept me in the loop every step of the way and saved me thousands on my Apartment insurance. He is extremely pleasant, intelligent and responds to calls, emails and texts immediately. I cannot give this fine gentleman enough praise.</review>

We were introduced to Jackie, who has been just terrific. She is warm, friendly and professional. She took the time (a long time I might add) to answer our myriad questions, and guide us through the different insurance products.

The auto insurance we chose provides greater coverage for less than our previous insurer. We haven’t made claims, but we are very satisfied.

Highly recommended.<//text><Rating>5< /Rating><GmapID>0x80d954f92366ca6d:0x26e43bf1f78bc8f4< /GmapID></record>

Richard Turner Insurance Agency was a joy to work with.  I communicated specifically with Jackie.  She was incredibly responsive, informative, professional, and kind.  We reached out to the agency about insuring our new home that we were in escrow on.  Jackie was extremely knowledgable on what policy was right for us, and she turned everything around very quickly.  We highly recommend this agency (and specifically Jackie!) for your insurance needs.  Thank you so much, Jackie!<//Text>

Always friendly, responsive, and packed with good information, he’s helped me establish the property insurance for a two unit purchase, transferred the coverage for another property from another agent, and converted that coverage to more align with my needs.

The only problem with this insurance company is they send three or four policy copies when you renew. Being a responsible person I have to go through each of them to find out if they are the same to date they are the same. Just a waste of time and money.< /Review>

When I contacted your agency I spoke to Jackie.  She helped me get signed up, which satisfied Nationwide because they said I needed an agent. She was efficient and helpful in acquiring a new policy for our home and automobiles. I appreciate her willingness to walk me through the process.

I’ve been with Nationwide for a while now and I can’t complain. OMG, Jackie is simply the icing on the cake. She’s so responsive and professional. For sure, this lady knows what Customer service is all about. I wish I can receive such a first class service wherever I find myself.</review>

I've worked with Ron Barr and Jackie Povondra for about two years now, and I would highly recommend their services! Ron has helped me with liability insurance for both a for-profit and non-profit organization that required more complicated than normal insurance to work in K-12 schools and universities. Jackie is always quick and responsive to get me certificates. They are awesome!< /review>

GG Tile and Design has been a client of Richard Turners Agency for many years. Richard and his team have always been very responsive and professional. His agency has always made sure to quickly provide us with insurance certifications for our clients as well as review our policies to ensure we are properly insured. Thank you for handling our account over the years.< /Review>

Jackie is the office manager.  Richard is the Agent.  I've had reason to call a few times since I started iwth Nationwide Ins. for home and auto.  Usually speak iwth Jackie and NEVER have I asked a question she didn't have an immediate answer for.  She knows her job, like the back of her hand.  Cheerful, factual, knowledgeable.  I've spoken with Richard twice when Jackie was not there and I've always found him to be responsive and professional.  These are the two experts in Nationwide Ins. and I'm thankful they're there, know there jobs and can sort out my questions have the answers, on the spot.  I also saved a lot of money on my homeowners policy with Nationwide Richard Turner agency in San Diego.  THANKS Turner agency.  You rock!<//text>

Great items and as good as name brands 👍 The staff is always very helpful. I get most of my beauty supplies from them.  Also love their gift items for my Customers.

<text>Wow do I regret walking into this store. Manager arbitrarily invents policies, refuses refunds, and makes up that “credit card machine” isn’t working. No social distancing or respect for CA guidelines. The products are also lousy. It is absolutely shocking that this place has any business given how rude and lousy the customer service is</text><rate>1<//rate><time>1603668799657</time>< UserId.>

Twice I've been to this location and they don't have the product I'm (still) looking for. Was there last week and was told, "it will be here..", I went back a week later only to hear.."oh it didn't come in..maybe tomorrow"..grrr..who knows? Sigh.

The customer service is pleasant, the girl seems to be extremely knowledgeable about hair products (as she should be:).< /Text>

<date>1615089728967</date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>One of the worst and unprofessional experiences I've ever had at a store, workers looked grumpy and unprofessional. The reason why I had went to this store was for returns, a person came up to me which I'm assuming is the manager. Asked me for the reason of the returns, I stated my reason. Than he accused me of being a reseller, which is A unprofessional, and B none of your business. The reason why I was even returning the items was because I had gotten them for my cousins who had just came here, they did not like the product because it was too colorful and not their style. At the time I did not say anything except apologize, and he said it was because they lose money on returns. Now looking back as a manager that is very unprofessional because once again A you accused a customer of something and tried to press them, B you now lost said customer because you gave them such a bad experience. Hopefully the manager can learn from this, and or the store undergo new management. I am definitely going to let corporate know about this.</text>< Pics>

Today my sister and my brother-in-law came from Outside of USA and made a few purchases at finishline and they had horrible service from the cashier, very rude and a very bad character, her treatment was not pleasant.  I didn't get her name since she was not wearing a name tag, but she's tight skinned  and robustly. Hours later they are still upset. They are thinking of returning the 5 pairs of shoes, but dont want to see her again. And for that same reason they did not purchase more. Good thing there is way more places to shop like Nike and Adidas.<//Review>

I made an online order and tried to do a return/exchange over the phone with customer service and it was literally like talking to a wall. I went into Finish Line at Ontario Mills and treated like a Queen lol. They helped me with my return and even helped me find a n and kicks!</text>

Worth customer services ever.  The manager Melissa is the worst. She has no manners. She has no customer service skills. She talks and acts as if she hates her job and teaches her employees to be just like her.<//Text>

Horrible customer service. Was told they had a shoe over the phone. Got there in 10 mins from my call and i get there and ask for it. They didnt even bother checking and said sold out. Bad attitudes too. Its rediculous. Customer service is everything.<//text>

Horrendous customer service. These low level workers just looked at me when I was browsing for a shoes. I went to Footlocker instead and bought a pair of huaraches.</review>

< Review>
TERRIBLE customer service, I would give 0 stars if I could. Had to wait 20 mins for an employee to come out from the back and help us, and then had to wait another 15 minutes for them to even find the shoes we picked. They had shoes on display that they didn't even have sizes for! Go to Foot Locker, the employees know how to help people there.< /Review>

Now as fare your simple grill cheese sandwich. The Chef (My Wife) had already started cooking your sandwich while I was still ringing in your order. So while we were talking, She was actually telling me that the grill cheese sandwich was under the Kids and not sandwich button. So I'm so so sorry that you got So irritated. That instead of you addressing your issue right then. You left and went straight home to write a review and give me a 1 star over a simple grill cheese sandwich.

I probably won't go back, the two young girls who were working when we went were not wearing their face mask when they cooked our food and the weren't practicing proper food safety procedure to insure they didn't cross contaminating anything. I chalk that up to youth and a lack of training and awareness that what they do could potentially make some sick.  The fries were bomb.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Support Black owned businesses! Great food and fast service. I had a double bacon cheeseburger with mushroom with fries and I was completely satisfied. So glad I went here instead of a drive thru. It was so worth it. They have a wide selection of soul food and American food. Next time I'm going to try their catfish po'boy and a funnel cake. And the owner apparently makes pretty fondant cakes as a side hustle.</Text>

<review>Wow where do I begin. Was looking for a new delicious burger spot. Walked in there were no customers. Walked up to the counter and was met by a younger gentleman behind the counter. We began to order our food only to have the employee answer the phone without excusing himself and he then started taking an over the phone order which took some time pretty rude. Since he didn't even acknowledge me I walked away momentarily, I then heard him saw sorry about that and then he resumed taking my order only to answer the phone again and do the same thing. Frustrating. Finally took my order. It took 30 min. He then informed  me 10 min into the order that they were out of chocolate for the shakes I ordered so I switched to strawberry (not worth the $5). Once the food was ready I was handed the order only to see the onion rings were missing. Here is where it gets good. He said oh my mistake I'll make them. 10 min later he hands me what looks like an empty bag. The bag contained 7 small onion rings burned and broken. Looked like half the bag was missing. What a joke of a business. Chilli was cold and tasted like it was fresh from a can. $37 total haha jokes on me. Will never return.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIfbQ3qbQMuW0vur51KdR_6ttXsuQHTm7iKioz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

In the world of restaurants in Natomas, this burger joint is worth a visit. Service is polite. Burgers are hand pressed and fries are well seasoned. The outdoor play area is great for the kids. And considering the flavor and quality, i would rather go here than a fast food place because for just a little more $$ you get something well made and tasty. Good job guys.</Review>

Called at 12:10 for ETA and she said my food is on its way now. Called again at 12:30and she said they got lost and went back to remake the food. She should've called me at this point. My food arrived at 12:37. 1 hour 27 mins later. I had clocked out and back in from lunch so can't really eat it...but did since I missed it. The woman who delivered was really nice and explained what happened. She gave me an extra fries. The food was really good and I still gave her a tip. Ijs... that's.crazy!< /review>< resp>

Food was great.  One of the owners was working at the counter and was extremely friendly and served our food.  Casual little place that works well for singles, couples and families.  Protected area for the kids to play and a basketball hoop for all ages.<//text>

Even though they didn't have their Fried Chicken special in stock, the food we had was good, and the funnel cake was awesome. Very kid friendly with both bounce house and kid's slides. Also a nice little putting green. Above all I like to support family owned businesses. Most likely to return and check out the breakfast in the near future, although it's open menu all day.<//text>

First time visiting this place as we are new to the area. We mainly went because they had a play area. I had the cheeseburger and it was good. My daughter had the hot dog and liked it. She really enjoyed the ice cream.< /text>

My buddy and i went here today for the first time to try it out and we both got double cheeseburger meals and it was just under $30!!!   So we said that was a bit much and not for us right now and the guy at the register said rudely "there's McDonald's up there road".   Took him over 5 min to put the order in the register and had to repeat it 3 times to him.  Also drinks aren't included in the meals??   Needs some work and a price drop to get our business and an apology for that comment.  We went around the corner to monsoon burger which is great and got the same thing for $24!<//text>

Loved this place they have awesome wings and  big juicy burgers they upped the prices but not too much , it’s a small little piece of heaven on a corner in a shopping strip . it’s authentic good food and you can see the cooks preparing it on the grill & fryers which I really like . Every single time , great food quality and hospitality.</Review>

"Mom & pop" burger joint.   This place has great food and even has certified halal options.  Enclosed playground is great to bring your kids to and they even have a bouncy house.  Definitely coming here again, recommend the "Big Boy 1/2lb" burger with fries.</review>

Cooked to order and more delicious than any other burger spot in the area! This business is centered around family with a huge play area for the kids in the back. The owners are all about family and supporting their community. It shows in their number of repeat customers who appreciate having them in Natomas!</text>

Best burger I have had in a long long time. Pastrami burger is so good!!! Main reason we went to Willie J's is for the funnel cake, which was also delicious, the only thing that would have made it better was fresh strawberries instead of syrup and more whip cream.... Staff was very friendly!!!!!<//Text>

Best value in Sacramento! You get a burger & fry for $6! And it's not a tiny kid-sized or thin-patty burger; it's a substantial burger with a nice bakery-style bun! Bonus: Halal Meat, Delivery, Online Ordering, Excellent Customer Service< /review>

<text>Update, 12/4/17:  Went this morning, got a breakfast burrito to go.  It was excellent!  If you're living or working in the Natomas area drop by and give Willie J's a try.  Good food, large portions.

I work in the area and I am always on the lookout for a good burger place.  I discovered this place today and went to give it a try.  A bit hard to find, tucked back a bit from the other businesses, but find it I did.  I ordered a double cheeseburger and a large fries.  I'm all about the fries.  I can tolerate any greasy spoon's food as long as they have good fries.  Well, I was very happy with them, they were hot and crispy and nicely seasoned (they have several varieties, but I just got 'traditional').  I should have just gone with the regular size, as the large fries filled half of the giant tray they served the food on.  For the burger I went with the bacon cheeseburger, and I asked them to make it a double.  The burger was hand formed, cooked perfectly and very juicy.  I could barely get my mouth around it!  All in all a very positive experience.  I will return.  I only gave 4 stars due to the cleanliness.  All of the tables were dirty and the trash was overflowing, but it was just after the 12 o'clock hour, so maybe they had a rush.  When I came in there was only one other customer in there eating, but a couple of others came in while I ate.  Worth a try if you like home-style burgers and fries.  Very good. Kid who took my order was very courteous and even brought my food out to me.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Every time I get a burger here, there's something wrong with it: a chip of bone, chunk of cartilage, some kind of plastic-y square found in the meat, brown lettuce...  I've tried, I really have, but I just can't anymore.  However, to be fair, their fries are consistently delicious...< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>An atrocity. I took my entertainment group here and ordered a burger and a meal each. Seemed fine until a half hour later 7 out of 9 of us were either bloated, vomited and/or had flu-like symptoms. Not only this, but as we were ordering food, a large short mexican male seemed to have "little-man syndrome" over wanting to upgrade from a small to a large right before finishing order. I will not be coming here and I advise no one else does either!</Text>< Pics>

The name says it all. Mini Bar is tiny. So if you're sitting next to a crazy person, you're screwed. There's no place to hide. Except that they now have a parklet because of COVID-19. Long live parklets!</text>

This is a review for Mini Bar, but the Academy is a cool place on its own too!I've been to Mini Bar several times, but each time we always make sure to walk the exhibits and end the night on the roof with a drink to stare out over the park and at the stars :)<//text>

Great local pet friendly bar. Personally I dont have pets, but if you do this place welcomes them. They ask you keep them on the floor, furniture for humans only.

Service is great. Really enjoyed talking with locals. Great place to meet people for a drink and conversation.</Text>

<Text>Came in just now for a drink. First time here.
Nice decor and music. The volume is perfect for the setting they have created here.
Unfortunately the drink sucked. I ordered an old fashioned with rye straight. The beverage I received is a very small pour of whiskey and a huge* pour of simple syrup. A real shame from a place that advertises as having good cocktails. As a type one diabetic I rely on classic beverages that everyone prepares the same quality. Unfortunately the Mini Bar couldn’t deliver. You will pay less for a better drink virtually anywhere in this neighborhood.< /Text>< Pics>

Exactly what you'd expect, a pretty small awesome locals bar. Good beer options and a full bar. Always some fun art on the walls too.</Text>

<Review>It seemed like a nice little hole in the wall place, but the bartender wouldn't serve our girlfriends because he disagreed with a political conversation they were having with another customer. Furthermore, instead of just being honest and giving us the true reason he wouldn't serve them, he accused them of being drunk. Pretty lame.< /Review>< Pictures>

Mini bar is just that, mini.  This small establishment it a fine place for a drink with great cocktails, jazz playing and some cool art on the walls.  There are some tables up front and a small back room and a arching bar in the middle.  If there are more than about 10 people in the bar it feels kinda crowded.  It is also a challenge to get to the restroom which is precariously places in a tight corner.  Overall though good crowd, good drinks and fun place on Divis.</review>

It's a great little bar but tables to spread out onto. Happy hour till 7p is $5 well drinks, $2.50 tecate and if you're lucky they might even give you some chips and Quesa.</review>< Pictures>

Pleasantly surprised by this place. Interesting art fill the walls and you can get you classic list of drinks here. Nothing incredibly impressing but a solid vibe.</Text>

< Review>
We really like this place for a quick bite during lunch. It's easily accessible right off the freeway. I've had the gyro wrap with rice, the chicken shawarma and their hummus. Everything is well seasoned with all the right traditional spices. You have to ask for extra garlic sauce! Their garlic dip is amazing! This is a legit Middle Eastern spot!  One of my major pet peeves is day-old pita bread. Every time I've gone into this spot I've always had fresh pita bread. It's delicious to have in a wrap or just dip in their hummus. Their chicken is never over cooked and their beef is always perfectly cooked. I do wish the place was a little bigger with more seating options. But the idea of a smaller hole in the wall ethnic restaurant is appealing to those of us who want to go in for a quick bite and experience authentic food. I'd like to see them have more drink options moving forward, more traditional Middle Eastern drinks would be fantastic with their meals. I would suggest ordering ahead of time that way when you arrive your food is ready, sometimes there could be a long wait.< /Review>

Unfortunately my experience there was extremely poor. The gentleman at the counter lacked customer service skills. As soon as you walk in you are greeted with " what do you want" did not seem to respond well to questions.<//Review>

I must have just went on a bad day or something after reading other reviews. The building smelled like cigarettes inside. They didn't have falafel at noon, which is whatever. I ordered a chicken kebab plate which shows comes with rice, chicken, salad, and hummus. What I got was RiceaRoni tasting pilaf, flavorless chicken, an okay salad, no hummus, but in its place a ton of the yogurt sauce. The chicken and rice was also smothered with the same yogurt sauce, oh and the man gave me another sauce container of the same yogurt sauce on the side. Nothing could save that meal. I was really disappointed. I literally thought I was being Punk'd.<//Review>

< review>
WORSE SERVICE wish i could No stars to this rude place.... They just refused to service me at 635pm when it stated on google & yelp they are open till 7pm... I walked in with intention 2 trying there salad waiting for my pregnant wife 2 come in from car ... So i decided 2 go to bathroom 2 wash my hands. As i open the bathroom door the lady from front yells the plumbing dont work. I told her just washing my hands went in and all plumbing worked fine. I walked out not more them 30sec later so i can order my food. When i walked out my wife was standing at register waiting to order. When i looked at the lady in the kitchen she came out and said we are closed. I told her i just want a salad. She said chef said we are closed. But there open sign was still on. So as im taking pictures for this review the boss comes out asking me what im doing. I told him for my review cuz according to online google and yelp ur open. He didnt apologize nothing. What sad is they had other people eating in there dining area. But from the vibe i got it was because we were a lesbian couple cuz they were rude from the start. So much for trying New places ... So disappointed<//review>

I had a great lunch today at Med Wraps Cafe. The staff were nice and helpful and the meal was delicious. I ordered the #7, the falafel plate which comes with a small salad, a heap of hummus, 5 falafel and 2 pita breads. Definitely worth trying out if you're in the area.< /text>

Good chicken burrito.

The price seems to vary every time we come here. Also I don't think they honor the 4.99 special that is promoted outside of the building. Good food but always hate the ordering process< /Text>

<review>The food is decent but be prepared for a long wait, this is not the place to go to if your looking for a quick bite....they didn't have any fountain drinks, only cans that were served to us warm. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place.</review><name>paul esparza<//name></record></dataset><record>

The food is delicious and the staff is awesome. My fiance ordered the shawerma plate and thought the meat was a little tough. They replaced it and provided a free soda for the inconvenience. We are very pleased with their service and their cuisine. We will definitely continue to eat here.</Review>

We ordered beef and chicken combo shawarma plate, falafel and beef shawarma wrap. Meat was fresh, juicy and very well seasoned.  The rice and their garlic sauce, both were very good as well. We will definitely come back.</Review></record></dataset><record>

My husband found this place online. I had the falafel plate, love it! My husband loved his food as well. Cooked to order, friendly, genuine authentic Mediterranean food and great hospitality . Great prices too.make sure to try their salad !! We live an hour or so away but hope to come again ! If we lived closer we would  definitely be regulars .</text>

$10 spent on shawarma saj, 25min wait for food, overly salty, tongue went numb after eating this salt bomb, will definitely have high blood pressure. Not recommended< /Text>

Went as a walk in. Someone waa in the back, no acknowledgement. Waited 5 minutes before walking away. I was in his view the whole time. Nothing. He wasnt even cooking. Just messing with things in the back. HORRIBLE service. Worst part is i stopped here on my way to work, so i had a horrible experience and no lunch.<//text>

It’s a Taco Bell, quick service and got my order right. Can’t complain. Speaker box was out of order I guess but the person out there taking orders was nice and did a good job< /Review>

They were so awesome about us getting food in the drive thru (w/out a car). We jumped on a scooter and we were able to get the over priced but wonderfully sentimental food from our past.
The employees were way cool, quick with our order, gave us almost no wait.
We were happy customers overall.<//Text>

<review>Best  crunchy and soft tacos exquisite flavor men I really appreciate the staff for making great job in the kitchen. Fast service very low prices . Clean and easy parking access.
God bless you all.

When the peace of Christ rules in our hearts, thankfulness overflows. Even in the darkest of times, we can praise God for his love, his sovereignty, and his promise to be near us when we call (Psalm 145:18).<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c778dae299ab:0xe2cc41ad0a0a5b6c</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Taco Bell is some what of a rare treat for me these days.  the few restaurants located near me were spread out and inconvenient... uber eats made it a little more accessible. But those fees all nickled and dimed me.. it doesn't take much to spend 30 to 40 bucks on dinner for 2.

SO ITS BEEN A while since my last trip to taco Bell. First of all..when entering the store I liked the new touch pad ordering device... I placed my order and Payed for it, a few moments later My order was on the counter ready to be picked up.

IT WAS so HOT and deliciously fabulous... I have never in my entire lifetime of taco bell, had such a warm tasty meal... I relly enjoyed my meal. The staff was happy and helpful.. and the place was clean...Best Taco Bell Ever .<//review>

<review>Tried 3-4 different dishes from this place and all of them tasted great so far! The most popular one is definitely the galbijjim. The fun part of ordering that is the very extra and showy act of the waiter using the torch to melt the cheese in front of you, a very instagramable moment.</review><Time>1612969427110</Time><user_name>Paige Smith<//user_name><userid>106766907712284000883<//userid><gmapID>0x80c2c778dae299ab:0xe2cc41ad0a0a5b6c< /gmapID><Rate>5< /Rate>< Pictures>

I eat in this lovely place quite often! This is the best place to eat.  I go to this spot routinely. The cooking is of high quality, the team is welcoming and the prices are reasonable. I enjoy going in this spot over a tasty supper.<//Text>

< review>
We have been big fans of Gangadin for the last ten years.  A friend of ours recommended we check them out as a candidate to cater our wedding back in 2010.  After sampling many other Indian restaurants, they won us over not only with their delicious, fresh fare but also their genuine care into making our day perfect with great service.  They were GREAT!  We have eaten there many times over this decade.  We have had gatherings with friends at their restaurant both large and small.  They never disappoint.  It's family owned and operated and they treat you like a member of their own when you dine in.  Sadly, they cannot allow diners at this time so I encourage anyone who loves Indian cuisine to try them out and/or continue ordering take out to support this great family business.  We must support our local small businesses.  It would be a sad, sad day if they had to close permanently because of this virus crisis.  We love you guys!!  (Gene and Ann Kirkland)<//review>

This place has changed but still remains very good. I always came here when school was over and place an order and for 5  years only one time I have had trouble with my order but it was quickly resolved and the workers there were very nice about it. For the most part, it’s a great place to get food as the prices are good and the staff there are very nice. I don’t come by here every single day like I used too, but when I do, it’s still a nice welcoming.</Text>

They are not the best Taco Bell to go to. Wrong/misunderstood orders. Staff seems overwhelmed, I try not to blame them because this is a horrible area and I've seen them put up with a LOT from customers. They can be testy.<//Review>

<review>The staff is friendly and quick. The restaurant itself is a bit compact, but has been recently renovated and clean looking. There is a self serve kiosk located next to the front entrance. This branch has a drive-thru, as well as parking in either sides of the store. I recommend it for a quick night bite, although be wary of the homeless people that come inside at times.< /review><UserId.>108166757078798509241<//UserId.>< Name>

The United States will be out of debt.
Donald trump will get out of office.
World hunger will be solved.
Elon musk will solve global warming.
PewDiePie will be number one on YouTube again
And the world would be rid of all the Karen’s

But really :) food is always good. It’s just that there is always something with our order. We have never gotten an order 100% right

I’m not really Trippin cause I get my money back from Uber. But working in the food industry, just up your order accuracy and check before you send it off :)< /Review>< Response>

<Review>Gotta say for fast food, I love this taco bell. Their staff is always in great spirits.  Their drive through lines are fast, oh and you can actually understand what their saying at the drive through speaker. This by far is the best taco bell! Also if your asking why only three stars, again this is a fast food joint not a 5 star dinner.< /Review>< pics>

But compared to other quick bite local restaurants, which have no parking, this Taco bell is a nice spot for a quick bite. They do have a RESTROOM for clients only and the environment isn't bad at all. My ALL TIME favorite is the Mexican pizza, but from 5 stars it went down to 3 stars cuz no more green onions!!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Bland and boring. The lettuce was bad in my crunchwrap supreme. The stale fritos...I mean it was all generally inedible. And this location charges more. For example a $5 box is $5.49 or more. Now, I know you don't go here for authentic Mexican, but Taco Bell used to be good. Now, however, you just come here when you got the munchies after an all day pot bender and will consume anything. So terrible.</review>

The food is as good as taco Bell gets (pretty decent) the staff is very nice and professional. When I was there they treated a rude guest with the same respect as everyone else. Because of this, the situation did not escalate. The rude guest simply made their purchase and left. I know that's the way it should be but I've seen a McDonald's employee throw a full cup of soda at a guest once for a similar level of rudeness...<//Text>

I understand that might be the reason the restroom wasn't the cleanest. They ask you to buy something in order to unlock the restrooms for you. When I was there I got some churros (I think) it got crowded and some people sneaked into the restrooms without buying anything at all. The restaurant is well located on the west of 8th street.< /Text></record>

Kevin D's review helped me make it a five star because it is for the taco bell and not the socioeconomic status of some random somewhere between psychosis and pop culture memes.
I could tell the workers have teamwork. However there was  is a customer service is important feel to my visit.< /Review>

<Text>Ordered on doordash and the price of a bean and cheese burrito was $7. So I had to order a 5 layer burrito with nothing but shredded cheese and red sauce and beans. I received the wrong burrito. I received a supreme burrito which isn’t even close to a 5 layer burrito either. I tried calling the store to see what to do about a refund for the wrong burrito and no one would answer the phone. I would understand if they just gave me a 5 layer but a supreme? Cmon. All I ask is for the team to fix the price of their items on doordash and pay attention to any requests. The team is lucky I don’t have an allergy.

Drive trhu attendant was very helpful and polite.  He even allowed me to order an iced coffee at the window after I had already paid for my order.  The only down side was the Naked Chicken Chalupa it was cold and hard, they must have had it sitting for a while already...  Always make sure you keep up the customer service quality but food quality is also a big part of customer satisfaction.</Text>

<review>Pretty decent Taco Bell. It has been recently remodeled and as such it is clean and nice looking. Plenty of parking and a convenient location. The staff was nice and friendly, but the soda fountain was not tasting correct at all. Luckily staff helped out and would fill the drinks with the fountain they have in the back. Still a Taco Bell so not the best, but the food was well assembled.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2c778dae299ab:0xe2cc41ad0a0a5b6c< /gmap_id>< Name>

<Review>*No A/C
*No self-serve soda fountain
*extremely SLOW service (not enough employees)
*NO EBT
*not enough seating during busy hours

All the employees look like they could suffer heat stroke at any time.... I wish the franchise owner cared about people over his bottom line... Then he might learn that his profits would actually increase... That's how America works.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2c778dae299ab:0xe2cc41ad0a0a5b6c<//GmapID></record>

The soda machine doesn't work. I say no beans, Pico de Gallo and Guac and it was the opposite with no cheese on the nachos, WTF??? They ran out of Dr. Pepper and Cinamon Twist. This place can only hold so little since it's remodeled to a smaller size, instead of making an expansion on seating, it shrink. My inside experience was not well as a customer with bottles of weed and a dog came in and stink the place. The cashier giving discounts to his friends, I'm never coming back to this ghetto taco bell.

<text>The staff is helpful and nice but the place is so dirty. The floors have a thick layer of dirt, and spots. You can tell they don't clean the floors often. The bathroom is even more disgusting and there were no paper towels when I used it. Makes you wonder if they also compromise on food sanitation. Had to put all of my concerns to the side to even eat the food which made me not enjoy it at all.</text>< Pics>

Meh yuk ... how did taco bell become America's #1 Mexican food ??? Idk but they really need to step their game up . I paid over $9.00 for a steak burrito with a taco and drink and no flavor at all I had better jail food then this .smh I'll skip taco bell for the next year until I get a craving again and that's rarely.<//Text>

Meh yuk ... how did taco bell become America's #1 Mexican food ??? Idk but they really need to step their game up . I paid over $9.00 for a steak burrito with a taco and drink and no flavor at all I had better jail food then this .smh I'll skip taco bell for the next year until I get a craving again and that's rarely.</Text>

<Name>Frank Morrison</Name><Text>The staff is helpful and nice but the place is so dirty. The floors have a thick layer of dirt, and spots. You can tell they don't clean the floors often. The bathroom is even more disgusting and there were no paper towels when I used it. Makes you wonder if they also compromise on food sanitation. Had to put all of my concerns to the side to even eat the food which made me not enjoy it at all.<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2c778dae299ab:0xe2cc41ad0a0a5b6c< /GmapID><Rating>1< /Rating>< UserId.>

Taco Bell is the best fast food in Korea Towne. The maintenance is extremely excellent. The management, Team member and crews very helpful. Hard working employee beautiful people. I love to eat in taco Bell. If someone have a bad experience in taco Bell. Is because either you have a personal problems or you smoke weed and you Bean drinking beer and hard liquor. And if you use the bathroom and there is not toylets paper Is because you stole the paper.
Thanks to the owner of taco Bell and your employees for the best inexpensive food..</Text>

Yo quiero Taco Bell. Haha well this Taco Bell has been recently remodeled very nicely, it's still small as most Taco Bells are anyways, quick and great service so far. It is a huge improvement over how it was before. It does not look as hidden as it used to be. Food wise, it is on point. No messed up orders, no hurting stomachs after it either(thankfully).</Review>

My mother always told me if you don't have anything positive to say don't say it at all, but I'm sorry momma I gotta do it. Please forgive me. I have a strong inkling that they are hiring the homless people around the area, a couple of the employees here look/smell so dirty / strung out/ like they havent slept or taken showers in days. Its off putting to think about whose back there making the food.< /Text>

< review>
Only 1 star but really none. Went thru drive thru even though there was some road closures employee told us to go thru drive thru to order. Once we complete such task no one ever took our order as we saw them walking in the lobby. Poor customer service. They are open till 1am and this was at 11:30pm.<//review>

<Review>I walked in ordering $1 menu asked to see the manger so he was working as an employee with a manager title you go taco bell.
So he is yes how can i help you? Hi sir i see alot of people sleeping on the side walk and i have $20 to spend. Can be be kind enough to offer something maybe few items its all going to the unfortunate sleeping on thr street . Hmm sorry sir NO. I said comeon whayeve4 happen to ask and you shall receive nicely. This guy has a heart if of a crocodile can eat you up alife.
Let me say this IS TACO BELL DOING ANYTHING FOR THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE
ANSWER IS hell no.
👎
So this is the story hundreds of people sleeping on the street taco bell cannot efford instead if making one one billion less one million for the homeless they cannot effort to lose that in profit. Not to mention u bet every emoloyee there works 38 hrs or less so they dont be reliable for unemployment and health insurance

(Translated by Google) More or less the customer service is empty and does not serve the customer well I mean the cashiers in the course of the morning of today April 16, 2021 from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM arguing with a customer lack of tact from the Cashiers ... The customer asks you for something, try to please him ... as much as possible, I take someone to ask to enter the bathroom and tell him to wait for the cashier to never tell someone will help the customer. There was never a bathroom. The customer had to seek help. in another employee who was cleaning the ATM, one of small stature and brown skin.

(Original)
Más omenos el servicio al cliente está vacío y no atiende bien al cliente me refiero a los cajeros en el transcurso de la mañana de hoy 16 de abril 2021 de 10:00 AM a 10:30 AM discutiendo con un cliente falta de tacto de los cajeros... El cliente te pide algo trata de complacerlo.. lo más posible que puedas llevo alguien a pedir entrar al baño y le dice espere el cajero nunca cumunico que alguien le ayudará al cliente nunca habrio el baño tuvo el cliente que buscar ayuda en otra empleada que estaba limpiando el cajero uno de estatura pequeño y piel morena..</text>

(Translated by Google) Great place, you can have a hearty and inexpensive snack. Clean and tidy. American fast food with a Mexican accent. My top recommendations!

<Text>(Translated by Google) Delicious and not so heavy and greasy. I liked it a lot, but it could be a bit cheaper considering the abundant portions of other chains in America.

In the case of tacos or burritos, which are often eaten by Mexican people, they can not eat or spicy because of their hardness or spices.
