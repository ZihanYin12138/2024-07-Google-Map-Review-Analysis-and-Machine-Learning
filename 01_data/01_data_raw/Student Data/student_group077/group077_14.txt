<Text>Arrived at the store and it looked dimmed. Not sure if the owners cared about this location but the server with a home-job dyed bleach blonde hair tonight sure didn't care to sell a smoothie. I used a coupon and was trying to scan Jamba rewards with the purchase and bleach server dude said it wasn't compatible. At first gave attitude and said tell me before scanning. Then he tries to say coupon and Jamba rewards are not compatible. I told him I used mail in coupons weekly at different Jamba locations and even combo at this Industry location 3 weeks ago. Server denied it and said I'm the one in charge tonight. He then refuses to return coupon to use at other locations. I'm thinking who power trips at a smoothie place? Especially when trying to sell $7 smoothies. I would avoid this location and go to the West Covina locations if you can.
1 star for server giving attitude and power tripping to selling $7+ smoothies.</Text>< Rating>

I love jamba juice so much, but I find the staff here is not friendly, right when you come in you don't feel welcome. And seems like they are busy doing something that you will feel your disturbing them. I instead buy jamba juice on different places.</text>

I’ve been here a few times. This morning I went with my family like around 10am and one of the girls making the juice give me a really bad attitude only because I asked for a straw and spoons. Bad customer service.< /Text>

2019/09 update, this place no longer servers juice...  No freshly squeezed juice. Only blended drinks. Service continued to be below average... No greetings upon walking, and no acknowledgement after making eye contact... Total speechless

Usually 4 stars is automatic for Jamba Juice, if not more. For this location I got punished for worker's own mistake, plus potential sanitation concerns. Asked for no ice & extra banana yet the guy who did my drink shaved in a bunch of ice. Not enough banana when I asked him to remake the drink. Gave me an eye when asked for more banana. Both servers were Caucasian, young, guys. Served my drink after 4 other drinks were made & my drink comes with banana chunks.

This same worker also touches everything while handling food with gloves... imho totally defeat the purpose of wearing gloves. I feel bad for whoever ordering the energy bowl... Seriously, not cool man.<//Review>

I don't consider this place a legit fruit store. They need to have more options. Also I wish I could come and get my shakes here but they don't seem to be able to make it right and it comes out tasting so gros. Even I make  my smoothies better and I'm don't even work there. Huge disappointment. Even I make better smoothies that are not watered down and full body killing sugar. Naw epic fail for a martial juice store.< /Text>

Okay, could be better
The drinks and smoothies were as perfect as possible, but the energy bowls featured overripe fruit and rotted grains. The grains tasted funny. The bowl looked mushy and watery. When you visit, remember to never get their energy bowls!!<//Review>

<text>Such a great experience at Scribe. The space is absolutely beautiful, and the people are friendly and helpful. The tasting included awesome food and you really can't beat the wine. If you're in the area, this is definitely worth the stop!<//text>< Pictures>

Could not have been more delighted with our food/wine pairing here! We made a reservation for a Saturday afternoon several weeks in advance, and had great seats under umbrellas outside the hacienda. Our server was lovely, and the food and wine were top notch. The Chardonnay is one of the best you’ll have, as is the rosé! Plus, the food is tasty and light, nothing too heavy but it’s plenty to keep you sustained during wine tasting. We loved the focaccia and the hummus especially!< /review>

<Text>This was my first time at this winery and really enjoyed the laid back casual vibe. There was outdoor seating with umbrellas. And even though we had just been to a different winery about 15 minutes away and had experienced some breeziness, it was calm and very pleasant at Scribe. They greeted us with pours of Rosé of Pinot Noir and plenty of bites to go along with our wine tasting. I only wish that they had an area where guests could relax and wander on the grass so that we weren’t limited to our seating area only.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMODIFSeGvMM9RjA3YYTs07IQ_vVJeBWkVxl6d5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4zlqS4Rwcdjha9uSMjnUbikT2zXN2No55HN-P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ8HbivpFscCrwbNeNOGBkA_tiLJiz2Lmt6F0Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x8085a91891ef4b3d:0xd4e8aa6c680b7e42<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Gorgeous scenery, delicious food, decent wines. That said, service was mediocre (they forgot about us and we had to ask to continue tasting) and it seems outrageous to me that they charge $70 per person for a small pour of 4 wines. There are so many other beautiful places to drink delicious wine in the area I don't think I'll be going back.< /review>

I was out of town when my quarterly wine shipment arrived. After a few delivery attempts UPS sent it back to Scribe. I reached out to them to see when I could pick it up. Unfortunately they were closed because of covid but the woman assisting me, Leslie, said she was happy to deliver it to me next time I was in Sonoma! Amazing service. Scribe walks the walk. You guys are the best. Thanks<//Review>

Scribe is a lovely spot. The upper and lower house are both well managed and give visitors lots of options for fresh air or friendly indoor services. The garden is sweet. Everyone I've encountered on staff is friendly and engaging, and the food is great/fresh. Also, I love the wine. The wine is very good. This is the only winery where I've felt the need to send wine back to my parents in the Midwest - and when that happened, and the wine froze in transit, Scribe totally handled the situation and fixed everything. My dad was very impressed. So thanks, Scribe, for granting me some hard-won Dad Masur approval.<//review>

Wow. No open tastings, dont mention anything about needing reservations. No bar area to stand up? Open tables and saying we cant sit? Pathetic. When you drive 30 minutes to get told that, very bad form. Not classy move. Dont recommend.<//Text>

Nice wines, overpriced tasting with  service that failed to support the price . Beautiful property. Please know that the First tasting 1/4 is “complimentary”  because they won’t be able to seat you at the time of the reservation. This is part of the 1/4 tastings so we only had 3 tastings as a table. Food was ok. Good for two peoples.  However very expensive for 3 tastings with somewhat abrupt service that expected us to join the wine club.</text>

There's a good reason why everyone loves this place. While it may be built up due to social media hype (take a look at all the bloggers and "blogger boyfriends" sitting next to you), the wines are great, the food is delicious, and members get to sit at the top of the hill with a beautiful view. Staff is attentive and passionate about their product so ask they questions and they will engage.</review>

<Text>This winery is absolutely the definition of picturesque! A tiny gem from the 1920s in Sonoma not more than an hour from San Francisco makes this an ideal weekend getaway. They are family owned and operated including the head chef!

Their tasting menu ($60/person) with 4 wines and 3 small plates, all locally sourced, is perfect for family or friends to spend a pleasurable hour or two on their outdoor patio but still an intimate setting unlike other larger crowded wineries in the area. We didn’t have reservations but they were able to squeeze us in, but you should definitely book in advance. Their Chardonnay really stood out with it’s crisp flavor. We didn’t expect this but we ended up picking up a jar of scribe honey. Highly recommend this spot!</Text>< pics>

Was suggested to try this place so we googled the website which said open from 10:30 to 5--- we show up and were met by a dog who is barking and nipping at me.  Get to the top and was welcoming by a man asking if we have a reservation (there was only 2 of us). We did not have a reservation. He told us that they were not available today as they were delivering to their customers this weekend.  What?  You have no time for new customers?  And no signs up front stating so?  We weren't looking for free handouts- but wanted to ship a case of good wine home to us.  I'd suggest Schug winery just down the street. They were amazing and inviting. Scribe lost a new customer because they were too busy to even ask what we may be looking for. Bad, bad customer service!!!  We bought two cases from someone else.</Text>

<Text>This is probably one of the best winery in Sonoma! From Rose as their welcome wine to Pinot noir to end the tasting it is impeccable!!! My favorite is their skin fermented Chardonnay. Also, they do food pairing from their garden. I have allergies and they were able to accommodate at short notice. Angela our host is very friendly host!</Text><Gmap_id>0x8085a91891ef4b3d:0xd4e8aa6c680b7e42< /Gmap_id></record>

Absolutely wonderful experience all around. I was visiting with family from Minnesota, and since we happened to be in the area I called the morning of on the off chance they would have an opening and got lucky! They managed to fit us in, but it didn't feel like we were last minute additions! We were greeted warmly and everything was prepared beautifully for us.

The wine was the best I've ever tasted, hands down. The food pairings went perfectly with the wine, and the staff member working with us, Anna I believe, was so helpful and pleasant and clearly in love with what she was doing. We learned a ton about what we were drinking, the history of the area, and the process of wine-making in general. A fascinating conversation.

The setting was spectacular, with rustic picnic tables under beautiful trees on a hillside overlooking the valley, with a view of the water and the stunning hills. It was like a fairytale and I could have easily stayed all day. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect experience, and it was undoubtedly a highlight of our trip.< /review>

<review>The staff, location and ambiance of this Victorian inspired Mission styled property combine to make for a charming venue and inviting experience that is on par with best wineries we've seen so far in Sonoma. Reccomend.

Scribe Winery is a cut above and beyond the typical wine tour circuit. There is no tasting room with robotic pours and disinterested explanations but rather a handful of picnic tables scattered on a hillside overlooking the vineyard. Reservations are a must. Staff are warm, hospitable, and knowledgable about the wines, vines, and assorted history. Nuts and cheese accompany generous pours of interesting wines. I'd go back in a heartbeat. This is the way all vineyards should be run.<//Text>

If you plan to visit a lot of wineries, don't come here first, because you will be ruined for all other wineries. They have created an amazing experience, from the rustic outdoor wine tasting (complete with blankets for cool days), to the included food accompaniments and one on one attention and conversation from the staff. Oh, and did I mention the wine? :) I believe this was the best wine that I had in Sonoma, hands down. I am considering moving to Northern California now just to take advantage of wine club member benefits (kidding, kind of). If you like the conventional standing at a bar indoors kind of tasting, then skip Scribe. If you are looking for something exceptional, then go to Scribe!<//text>< Pics>

My experience of Scribe wasn't bad, but it wasn't as stunning as some other reviews may make it out to be. There were great views, and there were delicious snacks with the tasting, but it was $25 for 4 pours — three of which were chardonnay. Our server was sweet but not very attentive, and we spent a lot of time between pours waiting. The signage coming in was *terrible* and both we and the friends we met almost wound up at the giant house that's in the middle of the area. The skin-on chardonnay was interesting, but not necessary. The idea of "always experimenting" is okay, but there are established methods of wine making for a reason.

If you're going for a leisurely afternoon in the sun and shade, this is a great place. If you're going for a variety of wines, looking for something to buy, and to experience true Sonoma wines, skip Scribe, where you're paying for the ambiance and experience, not the wine tasting itself.<//Text>

<text>Amazing! Scribe is a unique experience in Sonoma. There is no tasting room, but every group has their own picnic table where the tastings are delivered. It's reservation only but completely worth the effort. Trey was knowledgable and chill, like everyone at Scribe. He sat with us and shared stories and history of the label. The property is beautiful and every detail is covered.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Hipster Haven and an instagram dream. We tasted a Beaujolais, pinot noir, and a chardonnay. Maybe it was the fact that we'd already been to two vineyards earlier in the day, but the wines were hardly palatable and left much to be desired. Tasting menu was $65 for three wine pours + less than imaginative tasting menu. There were fruit flies everywhere. On a positive note, the views were unbeatable and the new Hacienda looks straight out of a Kinfolk Magazine. Scribe is young with lots of potential to get everything right in the coming years.< /Text>

Scribe is a must in Sonoma Valley! The wine is delicious (loved and purchased several of their Cab and Syrah) and the location/venue is incredible. Its perched on top of a hill overlooking their property and the lower valley. You can see the bay from that vantage point as well as watch the beautiful sunsets. I strongly recommend a visit.<//text>

<Text>The view is amazing, but that's about all I can recommend.  Some suggestions for the winery:  please have signage from the street, something other than a spray painted sign on a piece of plywood.  Also, have a list of the wines that you're serving on the website. At $35/tasting, I was disappointed to find out you only were serving chardonnay and pinot noir, which I don't care for.  Offer more imaginative food pairing than what I have in my car for snacks - we were served 2 small slices of cheese, a few baguette slices, a handful of almonds and an apricot. Although our server was nice, and tried to explain the wines she was pouring, it seemed like she was struggling to find words to discuss the wines. The whole place felt like an amateurish operation.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

This winery is simply amazing.  It's fairly new, as far as I know, which means that the wines aren't ridiculously over priced.  Rather than having a tasting room (as of August 2010) they have outdoor tasting on top of a hill overlooking the vineyards and a remarkable view of the south Sonoma Valleys towards the bay.  The pinot noir is amazing, as is their cab. The only regret I have is that they don't have a huge selection just yet, but what they make is worth drinking every drop.  Definitely worth the stop!</Review>

They produce mostly what I think is called "Nouveau-California" wines that don't really fit into the standard Sonoma Chard/Pinot Noir or occasional Syrah category. A nice informative tasting in a uniquely picturesque setting.</Review>

There's  plenty  of parking  available  for  all. The people  here are very friendly  and  the prices are reasonable. If  you get the chance stop by and enjoy.< /review>< Pictures>

IGA or Foods Etc. The store is clean and neat, courterous staff, great produce section, meat section is second to none! There is a full service deli yum! Large selection of alcoholic beverages as well as a good wine selection. Handicapped accessible, good parking and Dry ice is aviable as well. Give'em a try you won't be disapointed! 🌴🐒🐾🐹😷🇱🇷👣<//Text>

<text>It is some what ok....i dont like to see the homeless standing around the doors and begging for a dollar. It tookme alot to get here i think to myself. I just kindly say soor not today. It is not fair for all of us. I dont like when they follow and get mad if you dont help. So i say this. The complex needs to hire security guards for the whole parking lot. It will help on so many levels.<//text>< Name>

< Review>
Call them to come take a look at our roof for a possible repair or new installation of a roof. A guy name mill little guy or whatever the name was came out and did the inspection told my husband he will contact us back within 1 to 2 weeks for the estimation. Well a month went by and heard nothing back so contact them and the guy contact us back two days later and told us that they weren't doing any repairs and no estimation was done. Very bad customer service. Could've told us at the beginning of the inspection and could've found somebody else. Please avoid using them.</Review>

1. FAIL - Work didn't start until nearly 5 months after we signed contract.

2. FAIL - Roof failed inspection Twice.

3. FAIL - Took almost another 5 months to complete the roof and pass final inspection.

4. FAIL - Quality of workmanship was a constant ongoing issue.

5. FAIL - Nushake actually placed a mechanics lien on our home while dragging out repairs to correct their failed installation that couldn't even pass inspection.

6. FAIL  Over 2 months since the project was finally completed and paid in full and I'm still having to ask them, repeatedly, to remove the lien.

7. FAIL - Get EVERYTHING in writing if you use this company. I mean EVERYTHING.

We had a roof leak due to a heavy spring storm and water was leaking into our home, which caused extensive damage in one room. I called Nushake and spoke with Bertha who was extremely helpful.  Bertha understood my issue and expressed a genuine care for our situation.  She contacted Cecil who was able to get over to us to assess the damage and provide us an estimate within 2 hours of my call.  Cecil arrived and quickly assessed the damaged and knew exactly how to fix it.  He was able to get a roofer over the next morning to fix the issues because we had more rain coming!  That was quicker than I thought because Nushake was slammed with work due to the storm.  The roofer (unfortunately I did not get his name) arrived and got straight to work.  He corrected all of the damage quickly and efficiently and was extremely clean and professional.  I would recommend Nushake to anyone looking for a new roof or simply a repair.  They seemed to genuinely care about our emergency situation from start to finish and I could not be more satisfied with their level of professionalism the entire time.  Thank you Nushake, Bertha, and Cecil!  Also a big thank you to the roofer who completed the repairs!<//Review>

Job only took 3 days to complete and they had to tear off an old wood shake roof and put plywood down. Workers were very respectful of our
property and the finished job looks fantastic. I highly recommend Nushake for any roofing needs.<//review>

<Review>They did my roof in early December 2018.  They did the roof in 2 days.  One day after to finish cleaning up. So about 3 days.  They worked in and around the rain.  My roof looks great and I noticed that I don't hear it raining on my roof when it does rain.  Everything is sealed and installed properly.  I am grateful they came out and gave me the very best price out of 10 bids plus did a professional job with quality Owen's Corning material that looks great.</Review><user_name>Kimberley Wittrock</user_name>< rate>

Truly you can be confident this company is worthy of your business! They are extremely professional and dedicated to providing excellent work and customer service. Our salesman, Cecil, was prompt to the initial appointment (and called in advance too), provided clear, accurate and detailed assessment of the projected cost for our total roof replacement and installation. Bertha in the office was most kind, patient, friendly, helpful and professional in answering and finding out the information we needed for all of our additional questions. Jose Avila was most professional and attentive on checking on the work done at each stage and reassuring by even providing his cell phone number in case of any concerns or emergency. The work crews were fast, efficient, friendly and polite.
Do plan on having your initial appointment about 2.5 months in advance of your actual roof replacement as this company is rightfully booked well in advance. Do plan on having your work done in good weather. Don’t do like we did and procrastinate until it’s winter time.< /text>

<Text>These people are the best of the best. I am very critical and picky when it comes to having work done at my home, letting strangers in, etc.. This group blew me away.  It's a multi-step process, and the salesperson, the 5-6 crew members who worked on it, the office staff...all were upbeat, smart, friendly, respectful...get me a thesaurus! They made it fun even!

I dont like giving a bad review, but I know the company needs someone way more professional representing their great workmanship.<//Review>< Pictures>

Poor judgement, inconsiderate and selfish. Nearly caused an accident and put many others in danger simply to get a few car ahead in traffic. Driving in the rain if dangerous enough idiots like you blocking an entire intersection or cutting people off should not be on the road. If this is the type of person you are I can only image the type of work you do and the character of your business. I would never consider this guy for ANY type if work and neither should anyone.<//review>

Presidential solaris shingles were chosen amd this can be tricky for the unexperienced person. My roof is perfect! 5 stars for roof itself. The tearoff crew did great as well!. I am giving 4 stars because during the sales process it was difficult to get a timely and accurate response from David. He wants to sell you whatever he has a sample of in his truck! Getting actual and correct samples of the colors I was considering was a 4 month process.  If you can get a different sales person, I would recommend that. He seems honest at first, but over time I found that he makes many inaccuarte and sometimes contradictory statements. If you call the office, they just keep directing you back to your sales person and I was upset with the lack of responsiveness and accuarcy . Make sure you have everything written out.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Needed roof repair from fallen tree damage.    So pleased with Sales Rep, David Azcueta when he came out to do NuShake estimate.  David was very professional and gave a detailed written estimate.  Called office several times with questions and am so please with the office staff and all their help.  Roofers, Arturo and Saul came this morning .. job was completed, debris cleaned and roof looks super.  I would recommend NuShake for any roof repairs.  Thank you NuShake!!!<//Review>

Overall, we had a great dining experience.  Service was quick and friendly.  Pizza was hot and good.  I wish they had mixed all the toppings all over the pizza instead of just putting one topping per three pieces, not a fan of that.  Our crust was burnt on the bottom as well.  Atmosphere was amazing, however.< /Text>

Very friendly staff, and the pizza is very good (standard Papa John's chain fare).  The location is very small, and you can easily miss it if you are not using electronic navigation...it's barely visible from the main road.  Highly recommend getting the Papa John's app for your phone to order ahead of time; my order was ready for pick up about 15 minutes after placing the order.< /text>

I ordered on Friday for a party and delivery on Saturday afternoon. On Saturday at the scheduled delivery time the driver never showed. I called the store and was told the driver was out delivering it. While on hold for a period of time, I hung up and called back. At that time I was told the delivery was recorded for Sunday and not Saturday. This was a lie.

I was able to contact a local pizza place and they were able to save the party.  Papa's Pizza Grotto saved the day.< /review>

My order took more than an hour, 1 hr and 10 minutes! All I ordered was a pizza and a Papadia! How hard is it to make?? Call the stored and no apologies at all, all they said was they had to redo the order that’s why it took longer!! What a disappointment! I will never order again!😡🤬<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Not good. Not good at all. Won't deliver to my location, dry dough, poor flavor, and the restaurant made us wait (in a terribly hot restaurant) for a pickup order that we arrived on time for.

Can not recommend.<//Review>

<text>Terrible service, we ordered 5 pizzas at 9 and didn’t get our food until 12. The pizza was cold when they delivered it too. It wasn’t even a little warm, it was literally so cold the cheese solidified on the cardboard box it. On top of all that there was no “contact free delivery” at all, with this COVID-19 going on it seemed like they don’t even care. The delivery guy didn’t even have his mask on over his nose, and he just walked up to our door and handed my brother the pizza with no apology for how long it took. He just said “we’re busy” and left. Never ordering from This Papa John’s again.<//text><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>I ordered delivery like most people do and was quite happy with the service! The app that they have on the website was accurate for tracking your pizza and it arrived shortly after it said "out for delivery." The quality of the pizza I ordered was good and I have no complaints!</Text><Resp>None<//Resp><pics>None</pics><rate>5< /rate>< Name>

<Time>1604193459505< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>I placed my order 2 hr and 15 minutes in advance for a in store pickup. When I arrived the front counter did not even have my pizza ready. When asked why my pizza was not ready in 2 hours and 15 minutes they did not have an answer for me. They told me it would be at least another 45 minutes. When I asked why would they not put my pizza up next I was told "We have over 200 orders right now" When I reminded them that I placed my order over 2 hours ago they could not give me an answer. I was then told that there were people outside waiting. I suggested that the manager and I walk out and ask those customers how many of them placed their order over 2 hours ago, I was told that would not be necessary. When I asked for a refund I was then informed that it would be 3 to 5 days for a refund even though the money was withdrawn from my account in good faith as payment immediately after placing the order. This is the kind of treatment that will drive me from the brand permanently.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Ordered in advance, went to the store before picking up to have plenty of time to make sure it was done. I expected it to be cold. Nope, not even there. They took my payment, but couldn't find my pizzas. I ended up having to wait longer just for them to remake it.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>2</Rate><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Horrible. Love the pizza but today the customer service was horrible. The staff had no concept of good service today! When I asked to speak to the manager every other word out the "managers" mouth was ummmmmm and nothing was handled. Bummed because this is usually our go to spot when dinners not prepared.<//review>

< Review>
First time trying Poke bowl i was very hesitant I called the restaurant for advice on what to order the girl was very nice I got a med poke bowl with two springs 1 scoop of rice spicy tuna/ salmon scallops /green onion etc. It was delicious I must say give it a try add pineapple it balances the salty sweet loved it can't wait to try some more. Why 3 stars some of the ingredients I requested are missing jalapenos for one watch that!! But it was well worth it ordered through door dash yummy..< /Review>

Service was great, all 3 people behind the counter were super friendly and attentive. Food is great! Fish tastes super fresh and every add on is also great tasting. The place is clean and organized.

The only downside is for the small portion the price is big. We got two small bowls which are around half of what you would get at any other poke place and it ended up being $28 with no drinks or anything, so heads up if you're on a budget.

Other than that, great poke place!< /Text>

Good selection, although not like poke places I have been to in Menifee, Murrieta or Temecula. This place is pricey for quantity.</review>

This place is great! The staff is awesome, very friendly, service is helpful. They offer and explain all the toppings and options. Best pokebar I've been to by far. Would reccomend going here 💯. Fish was fresh, rice was well cooked and the toppings were cold. The bathroom was also pristine. Everything in the place was shiny clean. Very well taken care of. So good I decided to take some time out of my day to make sure I took nice pictures. They deserve lots of business!< /Text>

Absolutely Yummy! Very fresh. Polite employees. Nice variety. Price is higher than other places but since there in not much poke bowl competition in that immediate area, they can charge higher prices. Well worth it though. Will be going back.</Text>

The sushi, spring salad, scallops, cucumbers, ginger and crab was so fresh! That eel sauce topped it off nicely!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This place is similar in concept to a Panda Express - pick any 2/3 protein items, add starch, etc - but, the food is anything but. I got a small bowl with spicy tuna and salmon and a bunch of veggies (you can get as many as you want) with brown rice. The rice was a bit dry (as brown rice is often wont to be), but otherwise the mix was excellent. The person preparing my meal suggested keeping the spicy tuna separate from the salmon (normally they mix everything together by hand). I am not sure that made much of a difference since I was eating all of them together.
Overall, a good experience and I am certainly inclined to go back again.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
Less is more when it comes to poké - little more than fish and rice is needed - though it seems that rule is observed at exactly zero poké joints these days so I guess I'll just roll with it.  Poké Bar isn't perfect, but it's far better than most of its kind.  I went with the tuna, spicy tuna, and salmon bowl and it was pretty outstanding.  Especially for how crowded this plaza constantly is, this is a very decent option.</Review>

The service was good, but way over priced and not enough flavor. The imitation crab meat was so dry and flavor less. They charge me 18$ for a medium bowl and a drink. Almost forgot, i added avocado for a 1$ extra. First time paying for avocado at any poke spots.</text>< pics>

3 steps to making your own poke bowl: 1. Pick your size and base (s,m,l-nachos, white/brown rice, 50/50, greens); 2. Select protein (s-2 choices, m-3 choices, l-4 choices; really fresh tuna, salmon, albacore, and others) and mix ins (cucumber, onion, green onions, cilantro, jalapeños, etc). 3. Select sides (cucumber salad, seaweed salad, imitation crab meat). Extras? (Fried onions, garlic, etc.). Done.<//Review>

Always love their food and customer service is great, but sad to say...the last customer service on Sunday afternoon was very disappointing. The young girl we served me was not friendly, had a chip on her shoulder, and made me feel unappreciated!! Hopefully, the management needs to stress the importance of how you treat your customers makes a difference in the business.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>My car took a dump the other day. So I decided to shop around for a vehicle, I was referred by a friend here. They were already on the phone with me the same night my car took a dump ensuring me they’d take care of me. Yousef Tuha was able to work with me, and get me off the lot with a 2020 Camry. She’s a beauty. Key, is they did what it took to make it happen. I was a little stressed but he made the process pleasant. Will be referring people to this place. It seems they go above and beyond to make it happen for customers.<//Text>< time>

I am a single mother searching for a car for a while since my car completely died on me. Went to several lots and a lot of online shopping. I found Jay at AR (auto resources). The minute I stepped out of my (borrowed car) he made me feel comfortable and he ASSURED me that he would take good care  of me ,That I had nothing to worry about. AND HE DID.
He actually listened to my needs and he made it happen. I left with a beautiful car that was exactly what I needed and could afford. I will happily return for any future vehicles and will be recommending to friends.
Thank you Jay! You are a man of your word!<//Text>

My son and I had a great experience at Merced AR. Robert Sanchez greeted and guided us in making the right choice for choosing a car. He took us to all the car lots to find the vehicle that was going to be a great fit for my son. The car buying process extended much after 7 pm; however, Robert was friendly and patient throughout the entire process. He went above and beyond to get my son financed. I would strongly recommend Robert to anyone looking to buy a used car. He offered water and accommodated us with a phone charger. My son drove off the car lot with the car he wanted. Robert treated us like family and left us feeling satisfied and happy with our purchase. His customer service skills were exceptional.<//review>

I highly recommend Merced AR to anyone looking to receive a no-hassle, non-haggle, quality used vehicle! Gerardo at Merced AR helped me out tremendously when I was in need of a vehicle-from showing me the complete selection and breakdown of what type of vehicle was right for me in simple, easy to understand terms-to making me feel like a member of the family when I finished my visit. If you’re looking for a no-nonsense dealer to get you in your next car look no further than Merced AR!</Review>

I've bought 3 cars in the past, at 3 different dealerships!!! Gerardo is the only salesman I've dealt with that gave me no pressure AT ALL!!! I found my 14 FRS here and I absolutely love it, it's a huge plus that I got a good deal too. I definitely reccomend AR, check it out and ask for Gerardo. He will make sure you are taken care of.< /Review>

Best dealership in merced, friendly staff and they work with you and your budget, I was lucky enough to get Gerardo as my salesman and he hooked me up. 10/10 recommended to at least visit If you’re looking to buy a car.</text>

Gerardo and Chad worked together to get our family the vehicle we needed. They listened to us and kept working to find the price that woud work for us and our budget. The interest rate was the lowest we could have ever gotten with our horrible credit. We highly recommend this place to purchase your next vehicle!< /review>

(Translated by Google) I bought my first car with them at the time I needed a truck I asked them to find something according to my possibilities and what I was looking for and I am very happy now I have a 2014 f150 for 15 thousand low interest and payments according to what I can pay my brother just to buy your ford escape and like me is very grateful they helped us a lot I recommend them if they do not have what you are looking for be sure that they get it and even a good price

<text>Really like Dr Wendell very good storyteller. He is why I decided go to Bright Now. The staff is not as knowledgeable on how to guide the patient. The billing manager is most the knowledgeable. But X-Ray personnel was excellent and all dental care personnel is good. I was measured by the dental hygienist she was excellent. They have special for non-insurance $39 for exam and X-ray.< /text><Rating>4<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I went this place today because I had appoinment to get teeth cleaning. The lady come to me first she said to me I need to pay $1800 for the service plus insurance pay 50%.. I said to her how can I have to pay so much just for the cleaning? Then she told me I can not get service today because I need to talk to my doctor. This is the worst experience ever ! Be care for if you go this place watch for your money.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<name>adonis freeman<//name><date>1617725921864< /date><rate>1< /rate><text>This dentist advised me I had periodontist and cavities. They Charged me several fees that I was un aware about and gave me a deep cleaning and a gum disease treatment. It totaled $1000. I was unable to pay it. They refused to see me again until I paid it. I made a payment agreement and they lowered the payment from 1000 to 700 just to be seen. If you make a payment agreement the dental office cannot see you anymore and you will need to find another dentist. I paid the 700 and went to another dentist.

I first went to get my wisdom teeth pulled and the I advised the dentist I a had that disease. He advised this is what dentists do to get more money. I then went to another dentist in another city because they had 5 stars and great reviews. I was then advised again that I did not have perio at all. He showed me the screen and showed me there is no bone loss as I was once advised nor cavities. Do not go here. Do not trust these people as they will not be honest.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1617764644263, 'text': "Hi Adonis, Thank you for your feedback.

they will upsell you, beware.
make sure you look at your bill as well, I was being charged for x-rays twice.
Also, the phone line will leave you on hold vice a call back option.  A call back option would be much better.</text>

<Time>1611085465971</Time><review>So in the passed I've had Horrible experiences with the Dentist. It always felt luke they were trying to break records with complete disregard to there patients, needless to say lots of painful memories. It's always been hard for me to go to the Dentist, until I went to Bright Now! Dental on Fitzgerald. They are some of the best Professionals I've ever known, the Staff are friendly and understanding regardless of financial background, respectful and there attention to detail is excellent. I look forward to going to the Dentist Now and know that I'm in Good Hands. Thank you Bright Now! Dental<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This place was just such a joy to just go in. Marcia was super welcoming helpful, patient and really took her time to explain me what my insurance would cover and what would be best for me. I was there for a good while having trouble with my insurance, and she always kept her friendliness. The dentist was also very helpful, kind and knowledge. I will definitely continue to be a bright now dental customer. They also keep the place very clean and follow prevention measures while maintaining friendliness. It’s so refreshing to be received with kindness nowadays as many businesses customer services are not the best, especially during Covid times. But bright now is definitely amazing and a joy to visit.</Review>< Response>

The worst dentists in the area I don't recommend going there.  Look for another place with better service. The prices are very expensive and the staff did not help you at all. In the last 6 months I went to El Cerrito and in Pinole very bad service.  and the prices are crazy and high.  They made me buy their insurance.  and then they digested me that it was not dental insurance which is something for the discount.  More than three times I was in the same situation that they sit you, they give you x-rays and then they send you a person before to collect the payment and then the doctor arrives to tell you what they intend to do to your teeth and then they tell you that you have to make another appointment  the process takes 2 hours and they don't do anything to you .. bad service.    😁This is the better place Pinole Family Dental. 😁 🦷🦷1310 Tara Hills Dr suite f, Pinole, CA 94564🦷🦷 no drama. the real dentist is there doctor mark.  👍🏻< /text>

I had my first appointment in Rohnert Park a few weeks ago and I loved it! The staff was super friendly, and the light conversation made going to the dentist enjoyable. I went in to get some x-rays before scheduling my cleaning appointment, and was treated with respect and kindness by everyone. I was so lucky that Kim had availability to do my cleaning that same day! She did an amazing job, made sure I was comfortable, and dedicated a lot of time and effort to make sure I was happy. This office focuses on a positive attitude to bettering dental health, instead of shaming its patients for what they may be doing wrong.</Review>

I don’t have Aetna anymore I hope my new insurance works with this place to continue my general teeth work.<//Text>

Bright Now Smile Dental, has one of the very out going Staffs. I have found then to be of great service in calling you almost nearly or if your early like I was yesterday I was called in early.  Plus, Doctor Forest Wendell, DDS IS VERY  kind and keep does not keep his patients just waiting in the waiting room. I believe they are a bit  on the high end of there pricing. Other hand they to great work. So I guess you get what you pay for most of the time.</Text>

<Review>My first experience with bright now Dental has been a positive one. Bright Now Dental was very thorough and thoroughly explained everything as well. There are some things that were not covered At All by my insurance and that I will elect not to do but everything I can afford I will have done. They were friendly and thorough and my experience was good.<//Review>< pics>

I went to this clinic to get my normal 6 months cleaning. They told me I needed a deep cleaning and would not do my free 6 months cleaning I get from my insurance. I ended up paying for the deep cleaning and then they told me to come back in 3 months which I thought was just for my regular cleaning. When I got there they told me it was for another deep cleaning. I left and never returned. These people are all sales people all they want is your money.  Do not recommend them and will never return.</text>

The staff is very friendly and they do go the extra mile for their patients. Yesterday, there was an issue with me changing insurance and they stayed on hold with my insurance trying to verify my coverage.  It took roughly an hour to get it all sorted and they still kept my appointment. Dr. Wendell is amazing because he always explains things to me in ways I understand and is never forceful about procedures. He gives me options and always leaves the final decision with me. I love coming to Bright Now Dental and will continue to do so for years to come :-)< /Text>< pictures>

<review>For my family's dental needs, Bright Now Dental is our first choice because of friendly staff and experienced dentist like Dr. Wendell. I would like to recommend this office to anyone who is interested in quality comprehensive care. Because this office has its own specialty doctors such as orthodontist and oral surgeon, so I do not have to juggle with different appointments at different offices. Financial assistance offered at the office helped us to complete the proposed treatment that was pending from years.Thank you Bright Now Dental staff for taking care of my family's smiles :)< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This is a great Bright Now Dental office!! After being scammed out of $3000 by some 'specialist' Dr. Harandi in Walnut Creek, CA for the EXACT same surgery on the other side of my mouth, it was refreshing to find a real dentist! And this price was only $1400 for the SAME surgery scam dentist Dr. Harandi did! I will be making this Bright Now Dental practice my home office going forward. Thank you to all the wonderful staff here!< /text>

I had the worst experience here!! I came in to see the orthodontist for a consultation. He refused to give me the same treatment that a previous orthodontist at this same Bright Now Dental office had given me a few years ago. He lied and told me that it wasn’t possible. This office lacks professionalism and honesty. Do not waste your time and money coming here!</text>

I want to thank everyone at bright now for helping me with my toothache, I went in as a walk in and I got attend right away , they open at 9 and they let us in when we arrive at 850 , Everyone at bright now is a true professional, very friendly staff , it’s really affordable for those who do not have dental insurance like myself, I highly recommends everyone to give it try and relieve your stress of finding a great dental facility, thank you again for everything you guys did for me .</Review>

The orthodontist are incompetent and rude. No ethics behavior towards “customers” meaning patients. No communication within their own business. I was sent by one of their offices for an operation/root canal and, this incompetent doctor tried to give me a lesson of how and why I supposedly went to have his opinion, again I was sent by one of their offices!
When I’m already driving home, with a great toothache, one of their losers ser alentadora called me and ask me if I was already gone, really? She informed the looser doctor realized that I didn’t go to get his opinion but to an actual operation-root canal.

I really hope they don’t charge me twice for being told the same (root canal needed ) by the same businesses or, otherwise I will be contacting first my insurance and second the BBB and informed about the incompetency of this business staff and a possible scam to get more money from my insurance.< /text><user>100651462305728991263< /user><name>David Rodezno<//name><Gmap_id>0x80857704456be61d:0x7d45025dda40d972</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As soon as you walk in your automatically greeted, with a big friendly welcome and smile feels just like home. Not like other dentists that as soon as you walk in you feel like you want to turn back and never come back but not this place! Friendly staff and always so nice and clean!</text>

<text>Worst customer service I’ve experienced. The hygienist not a doctor decides for your treatment plan. Be aware of terms like gingival irrigation and local antibiotics just a ripoff not covered by insurances. Also always check with your insurance for copays they are good inflating them. Zero ethics!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>My son scheduled for an appointment because of a cavity, the soonest available time was 2 months later.  Then before the appointment they called  to cancel because they had intake of a patient on emergency. They could only reschedule for a week later. They are not that good , best below average, and it does not worth for the long wait  particularly there is an existing issue.  My husband was told to go to their recommended  outside specialist dentist for  periodical deep tooth cleaning. It was ok the first time, but not necessary after that because the dentist did not really do anything. It was costly and a waste of time and money. It was a malpractice for giving such a wholesale recommendation not based on need. Time to find another dentist.
PS> Bright Now called to cancel the reschedule appoint saying that no doctors will be available and wanted us to reschedule again for a later date. Enough is enough, bye forever. After reading all the bad reviews on Yelp of malpractices and  money gouging, we don't want  any dental work from them. Fortunately, so far we have had only regular exams not any other things.< /Review>< pics>

This is ultimately my favorite dental office I have ever been a patient in! Josabeth in the front is really informative about treatment, and the back office staff is incredible, making me feel comfortable despite my fear of the dentist. Dr. Wendell is great in explaining everything yet keeping it all so simple 😊</Review>

<review>I came in for a simple cleaning for my wife and I. Mind you, I have full dental coverage for the both of us. They wanted to add some antibiotic for gum disease, they gave me an estimate of about 1000 dollars, which they stated was not covered by insurance. I paid it. Months later, I receive another bill for 25 dollars. I paid it. Recently received another bill "Forwarded balance" for nearly 500 dollars. This company is not upfront about the costs of the treatment or bills. I had already paid over 1000 dollars, and they continue to bill me regularly for one single visit. This is a horrible customer service and business model. I highly recommend you avoid this place at all costs if you want an honest deal for their services.</review>< Pictures>

Im terrified of the dentist and when I say terrified i mean anxiety attacks & everything. I have NEVER found a dentist I actually liked or felt comfortable at until today!! They calmed me down and made me feel so much better. They knew how to make me feel at ease. I've always been a little self conscious and they made me feel so good about myself I think I thanked them like 10xs. They were AWESOME!! I never thought I'd find one I actually looked forward to going to</Text>

<Review>I went to Bright Now in Pinole Ca. to get some big work done.
I had 2 teeth pulled, an infection cleaned out, 2 implants, a bone graft and 25 stiches.
I felt no pain at all.
Then about 3 hours later, the surgon called to see how I was doing.
It was an excellent experience.

I have been going to Bright Now for about 3 years and they always perform expert service.

The staff is friendly and helpful.<//Review>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Decided to give this practice a try since they are near my work and my old dentist is in Oakland (I work in Richmond, hassle to go there and back). Initially they seemed like a normal dental practice, the dentist performed an oral exam after X-rays, did a periodontal chart, asked if I have ever done a deep cleaning, said no, and he replied that I won't need one. Identified potential replacement of an older crown that wasn't done properly. Went back few weeks later to do routine teeth cleaning, and the nightmare started. She performed a wishy washy cleaning, said I had some gum cleaning, asked me to come back in 2 weeks to perform a new periodontal chart, so I did. She started to poke very hard into my gum pockets, and produced numbers almost double what their dentist identified couple months prior. She said I have to do a deep cleaning and apply antibiotics to 21 teeth! Cost is a whopping $3700. I laughed and said no way. Went back to my old dentist 3 weeks later for routine cleaning, they found hardly any bleeding and the periodontal chart depths were almost exactly as what the dentist produced at Bright Dental.  I knew the hygienist was a scam. Last month called them to do a routine teeth cleaning (been 6 months), and they replied that they will only do a deep cleaning. Told them I am not interested, and they insisted. SO I went back for another periodontal chart evaluation, and the same hygienist (Harpeet) , showed her numbers and the numbers from my other dentist office, she got defensive , told me if you don't trust us then why come here. Explained to her that I was giving this office a chance to earn my business and find out how could the periodontal chart numbers vary so drastically in less than 3 weeks. She proceeded to redo the chart and this time she was inserting the probe even harder (remember this is inserting a metal probe into gum tissue, insert until you feel resistance, not keep inserting into soft tissue to get extra depth readings). Anyway, she said the numbers are still too deep and she would only do deep cleaning. I requested the dentist, Dr. Wendell came and said ethically they cant perform regular cleaning, told him that I would sign him a waver, do a regular cleaning, he said he trusts the hygienist numbers, even though his own numbers were less by 2-3 mms per reading. He retorted that different operators can get different numbers by 2-3 mms, so essentially the margin of error is 3 mms, so told him if you subtract 3 mms from her readings, then my depths would all be 3 or less, and thus normal. He still claimed its unethical. I told him that you cant force a particular treatment on a patient , we are not in Cuba, and this is coming across as a scam, want to rip patients off. He gave me the spiel that this is not ethical, and he can only do deep cleaning or nothing. I told him I made a mistake coming to this office. I later called their corporate office and complained, they had the office manager call me, explained to her what happened, she insisted that they won't do regular cleaning, only deep cleaning. Cut a long story short, I switched to another dental office nearby, this practice is a rip off, stay away.</Review>< pics>

<text>Had a 09/07/18 8:00 AM cleaning appointment, first patient of the day.  Completed my patient update in about 2 minutes, waited over 45 minutes with no contact by anyone in the office, hygienist then called me as if my appointment was 8:45AM.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>They seem very unorganized.  Had to schedule 3 different appointments to do something I could do in just one appointment with my previous dentist.
Have to go through main customer service to get to the main office.  It is also very difficult for them to look up when my next appointment is.  They seriously need to get their act together.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Horrible service never go to this new location. I called them if they accept my insurance frond desk girl said they accept. I took a bus to come to this location with baby frond desk girl made me to a fill out the papers then she said I have to pay cash. If they don't accept my insurance why would they say yes. Anyways took me long time to get here with baby.<//review>

They don't even deserve 1 star
WORST DENTIST EVER!!!!!!!

They try to bill you for services you did not need or request and then when you get contacted by billing, the put you on hold to speak with the office manager.

Of the 6 times I've been contacted and told to "Hold" the office manager is always at lunch not matter what time of day or night it is.

ODD or just fraud.  I'm contacting my insurance company to cease listing them as a network dentist.</review>

Nice fields to play on, saw a variety of self equipped players and large games. On a good day 16v16 make sure to drink lots of water and wear some sun screen in the summer it gets hot on the fields!</Text>

This is the best field I have ever played at. Everyone is super helpful and this field is very inviting to all types of players while still retaining the skill that I like to see. 10/10 would recommend to anyone<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>This is the best paintball field in the bay area if you're looking for a private event, birthday party, or are new to the sport of paintball. Very professional referees that will ensure you and your friends have a good time in a private party. On the other hand, there are a bunch of regular self-equipped players that comprise the "main game". At American Paintball Park's main game, you're likely to find some of the friendliest and most helpful people in the game of paintball. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in paintball give this facility a shot, it is excellent.< /Text>< userid>

I played here for the first time last weekend and it's now the only place I want to go.  A buddy and I tried to go to Santa Clara but they don't allow outside paint. On a whim, we decided to check this place out, and I'm so glad I did. Cliff is extremely friendly, clearly loves paintball, and goes the extra mile to personally make sure you're having a good time. The fields are unique, with some really fun twists on classic field types. And if you're a bit tired of showing up and only seeing CS2's and Luxe's, this place has insane diversity. Autocockers, pump guns, magfed, old-school guns and just about anything you can imagine was being played. If you're looking for a place that really shows off the best of this sport, there is no place in the bay area I'd recommend more than American. I plan on playing here a few times a month from now on.</review>

<text>I was recommended American Paintball Park by some folks online, while discussing places around the Bay that were professionally run, and more welcoming to self-equipped players. Indeed, when my friend and I arrived there was a decent sized group of friendly people with their own gear who seemed to be regulars, as well as a couple parties of rentals. The owner was a good guy, even providing some hot dogs for free during lunch, and his prices for admission, rentals, and paint were reasonable. Likewise, the refs were helpful and fair. I wish we could have got in another game per round (2 games with a switch between sides before a break) but as it was, we still got in maybe 12 games in the 5 hours we were there which was fine by me. I definitely look forward to playing at this field in the future.</text><Gmap_id>0x808fe0bd811c69d5:0xf4d6e50d580aaf98</Gmap_id></record>

Stand up playing field for both newcomers and experienced players alike. Cliff, the owner, works hard to make this a place where everyone can have a good time and that carries on to his staff as well. Well worth your time to check them out!</Text>

Fun place that doesn't try to nickel and dime you.  Paintball field is large and guns and rental gear work great.  Animals have dug some holes on the field and those are kind of dangerous.  My kid stepped in one hole and hurt his knee.  Other than that the place is great.<//Text>

<Review>American Paintball Park was SUCH a trek to get to from San Jose, but it was SO worth it!

The staff was fantastic in making sure everyone knew what was going on and explaining the rules. They were great in facilitating the games and not hovering over everyone. There are a few different fields and they're all pretty fun.

I would HIGHLY recommend this place and would definitely love to come back for any group events.</Review>< pics>

I'm a gamer from Venture Games way back when, I got used to a family feel where you can chat with the owner.  While this isn't woods ball it's got that family feel. I loved it here and am planning more trips back. The doors field is so much fun!

The refs are on it too, never saw any cheating but you could never get away with it if you tried.

If you want screaming and fast action speed ball this probably isn't your field. But if you want a weekend of fun this is the place!

TL;DR AWESOME FIELD, GOOD REFS, PLAY HERE!< /text>

I visited American Paintball Park a couple of weekends ago for my son's 13th birthday party. Paintball is not an activity I personally would get excited about, so I wasn't thinking I'd care much one way or the other about the experience, much less write a Google review. But Clif and his team, and the experience they create for their guests, are awesome! First off, they have an enthusiasm and sense of fun about the sport that is positively contagious. They are very clear about the safety rules and procedures, and stay on top of safety at all times without being gruff about it. Our group got its own guide out on the play field and he was helpful as both a "referee" and instructor. He never missed a beat, taking them out for a break when they were tired and thirsty and rallying them to get back at it when it was time to head back out for more paintball action. Best of all, they outfitted Granddad with a mask and safety vest so he could go out and get some good video of the kids in action. I also appreciated the easy of booking the party online and the follow up email I received from Clif confirming the reservation. Top notch service from start to finish!<//review>

<Review>I recently moved into the bay area (from TX) and was looking for a place to "call home". American Paintball Park is absolutely, 100%, no questions asked my new "home field". On a Sunday (27 June) I had originally planned on visiting another local field but after seeing the rave reviews I was convinced to spend the extra 20 minutes driving to experience this field. I was thoroughly impressed! I showed up as a solo player wanting to join the public games (and dragging my girlfriend and daughter along to watch as well).

The experience was above par from the moment we pulled into the driveway (speaking of which, Google Maps will give you the incorrect directions, having you enter towards the back of the property,  a trip around the block has you at the right spot). Paintball masks line the fences and as you pull up the owner is standing there to shake your hand, thank you for you coming out and pointing you in the right direction for registration.

Prices were fair, if not below what I've seen available elsewhere in the area. It's clearly a family run operation and I like that, the owner was excellent when it came to making the rounds during breaks, talking with everyone and getting good conversation going between separate parties. When I was out playing a game, then rejoined my family, they were always relaying stories of how the family came over and talked to them, introduced them to their pets (Chicken Dog!) and made them feel more than welcome.

The players at this field are exceptionally nice, assisting with equipment needs (I forgot to bring a rag and a squeegee) and the regular players step in and assist the staff with tasks like air refills. The staff was always on point, calling players out as necessary and emphasizing when an out player was leaving the field. They also chrono before every game which I found to be extremely professional - this field focuses on safety! Masks on early, well before the chrono station and barrel socks on before exiting the field.

There's a nice, unique, selection of fields - although I would rank them on the smaller scale of what I've experienced in the past (coming from a woodsball background). Games are primarily elimination style and the park features a number of different fields focused on various themes (hay bails/rock walls, stool bunkers, door (provided by Google I learned) and dirt mounds. The doors field is a particularly unique design I had never seen before that was a joy to play on. There's also an attack/defend field consisting of an uphill climb for attackers against a small team of defenders within a building facade.

There's a minimal snack bar that's not outrageously expensive (50 cents for a bottle of water) and they grill hot dogs for lunch ($3 gets you a very large hot dog and a bag of chips). Games were run very frequently, with 10-15 minute breaks in-between. I arrived around 10:30, left at 3:00 and played 5 games experiencing every field except for the dirt mounds. There's plenty of shaded seating for observers and break periods and they seemed very accommodating when it came to moving benches/tables around to setup personal grills, birthdays, etc.

I absolutely love this park, probably more so than my "home park" in Texas. They did such a great job at making us feel like part of the family, we were more than welcome there and they were truly appreciative that we would come spend the day with them,

My only cons (and they weren't enough to mark this review down from a 5):
- Some of the fields are close together. I noticed some players engaging players from another field.
- The "out players" area isn't clearly identified on each field and often times in a danger zone between the two games - you may very likely get hit while waiting for the next round.
- The field design is entirely centered around elimination - you won't find any long-form or scenario-type games here.

I've certainly found my new home field. If you see a blonde in a tan flight suit, enjoying every damn moment he spends out here, give me a fist bump.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Dined on outdoor patio. The food tasted great, even though it arrived cold. Their service absolutely sucked! Maybe it was the outdoor setup, never had that problem indoors. Drink was not worth it either, but have always enjoyed them in the past.< /Review>

The owner John is a cool dude. Great service, yummy food and great drinks. Outdoor seating is spacious. They have corn hole, giant connect 4 and giant jenga, for entertainment. Nice outdoor lighting. The inside has a really nice mardi gras theme.<//text>

We wished we had taken his advice but wanted to try some different stuff since it was our first time. The food was good. Nothing spectacular but it was good. Personally not a fan on their chili but everyone's idea of good chili differs. The decor was spot on for the theme.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>This bar. Now, I've never been to this bar, but you don't have to visit to understand that it is a great place in the better part of downtown Fullerton. What sold it for me without the need to even buy a drink is the hospitality of the owner, a kind person with a look of respect for anybody willing to do someone a favor expecting nothing in return and carrying the willingness to offer a helping hand to a complete stranger, with a smile on the side and an obvious passion to keep their business afloat in these trying times. Movies? No. The beach? No. A drink at Bourbon Street on their new outside patio? I'm there. See ya soon!</Text>< pics>

<Text>Recently visited on an early Saturday evening. The atmosphere of this place seems to be more like a bar than a restaurant. We had reservations and had to walk around to find someone to help us check in. Once seated, we noticed that there was a live band, and multiple tvs playing sports. The noise level was moderate to a bit high. Getting back to the food, we shared chili cheese tots, I had the pork chop which comes with creamed corn and potatoes,  while my friend had the Chicken gumbo. We both thought the food here tasted great & glad we made the trip to downtown Fullerton. Service was attentive and friendly.  Parking close by in a lot and structure. Free parking before 9 pm. The cost for the dinner with one iced tea & one premium beer and tax came to just under $60.<//Text>< pictures>

This place is very nice, so cozy and the staff is welcoming. There was a band, the food menu is nice and not traditional we tried the shrimp potato skins and a seafood dish that has mussels, scallops, sausages and rice,  very yummy.  A wide variety of beers on draft and few new Orleans beers as well. The crowd is from all ages. Recommended</text>

Buffalo Chicken ($3.50 each) is topped with bleu cheese coleslaw and served on a grilled sweet Hawaiian roll. It has that vinegary buffalo sauce aroma when it comes to the table so you know it’s going to be good. It is just spicy enough to get the taste buds going. The coleslaw adds a crunchy texture but could use more bleu cheese. Rating: 4.5/5

Cheeseburger ($3.50 each) is topped with thousand island, tomato, red onion, cheddar cheese, basil aioli, and served on a grilled sweet Hawaiian roll. The beef patty has a flavorful grind and is very juicy. The basil aioli is the kicker. The herbaceous flavor is refreshing and matches perfectly with the beefy slider. Rating: 4.3/5

Beer Battered Alaskan Cod ($3.50 each) is topped with Cajun tartar sauce, coleslaw, and served on a grilled sweet Hawaiian roll. This is definitely the lightest of the slider selections. The cod is crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside. The coleslaw adds a creamy flavor and crunchy texture. Overall, it needs something to punch up the flavor – either acidity like vinegar and/or sweetness by adding pineapple into the slaw. Rating: 3.7/5

Fried Mozzarella ($3.50 each) is crusted with panko, topped with sriracha honey jam, basil aioli, and served on a grilled sweet Hawaiian roll. Imagine a baked brie in slider form. The mozzarella has a crispy exterior and creamy, gooey interior. The honey sriracha jam adds a fruity sweetness like a baked brie. The basil aioli adds a touch of herbaceous flavor. Rating: 4.7/5

Fried Chicken ($3.50 each) topped with garlic mashed potatoes, country sausage gravy, and served on a grilled sweet Hawaiian roll. This is my first time having mashed potatoes on a slider and it is great! The mashed potatoes have a creamy texture and perfect garlic flavor. The fried chicken is crispy and seasoned to perfection. The gravy adds a creamy, sausage flavor reminiscent of biscuits and gravy. This slider could use some acidity to really put it over top. A dill pickle would be perfect. Rating: 4.9/5

N’Awlins Burger ($3.50 each) is topped with caramelized onions, gorgonzola, garlic aioli, ginger slaw, and served on a grilled sweet Hawaiian roll. The beef patty has a flavorful grind and is very juicy. The first thing that hits you is the sweet caramelized onions. The creamy, tangy gorgonzola balances out the sweetness. The slaw adds a crunchy texture. Rating: 4.9/5

Pulled Pork Slider ($3.50 each) is one of the Sexy Southern Sliders topped with ginger slaw and voodoo BBQ sauce. The pulled pork is ultra-tender and just melts in your mouth. A little salt would pump up the porky flavor. The slaw adds a crunchy texture. Rating: 4/5<//Text>

<review>The Bavarian pretzel and cheese was good. The bacon burger that my son had was also good. I had the shrimp and grits which was good but had an excessive amount of grits and could had had more shrimp in it. The side salad had mostly lettuce and only a few tomatoes and onions. The service was good and friendly. Nice place but they were showing music videos from the 80's that weren't quite kid friendly. There was another family next to us at the time that agreed.. could have been saved for a later time so kids didn't see them.< /review>< pictures>

Good ambience. Ok music. The Honky-tonk taco was yummy. The steak fajita taco, the meat was burt to a crisp. Probably would have been yummy otherwise. The beer menu doesn't specify which beers are bottles and which are draft. Disappointing. I ordered a $25 bottle of beer. Half way through the first glass i noticed the ABV was less than what was advertised on the menu. Not happy. False advertising. Part of the decision in buying a $25 bottle of beer is the ABV. I let my server/ bartender Heather know of my concerns. She rolled her eyes and offered no help at all. Then 15 minutes to close out a check at 830pm. Really!? Not going back. Too many other options available. Bye</text>

This was a fun little gem for some good southern style food and a cocktail or two. The music playing is in sync with videos playing in the many tv's.  Its right next to a few other places you can boumce around to if you're feeling adventurous...all with their own unique vibe<//Review>

One of the most iconic streets in the world, and the center of New Orleans’ party scene, Bourbon Street is located in the Big Easy’s oldest neighborhood, the French Quarter. The street extends for 13 blocks and is lined with bars, restaurants and souvenir shops.

Bourbon Street Tip:
One easy way to avoid the bulk of the crowds is to stick to visiting during the day, when it’s relatively quiet (one major exception: during Mardi Gras, when more than 100,000 people swarm the street). The hot and sticky months of June through September are low season, as are December, January and Lent, the seven-week period after the festivities of Mardi Gras.< /review>

This place needs better music. As long the DJ continues to play rap music, this place will be empty with no customers.</Review>

Poor service, misleading menu. Horrible experience overall. No hostess so I assumed seat yourself. I asked someone who appeared to be a server, but I guess she's just a busgirl, because she only folded napkins while I was here. I asked her if tpseat myself and she said, "I can show you a seat but..." I said ok, I'll seat myself. It took 10 minutes for the barmaid to come to my table and ask what I wanted. I ordered an appetizer and she asked if I knew what main I wanted. I hadn't decided so I asked her to come back in a few min. She came back when my appetizer was ready .....10 min later.
She St it down, never asked what I wanted, just took my glass to refill my soda. Misleading menu because the Cajun nachos say nothing about pick or onions except green onions .... These things are listed with time of pico. Never coming back and do not recommend others... Unless your knee of the regs that was in here, they won't know what I'm telling about because the barmaid knows them< /Text>

Never came here to eat only came here for the bars Thursday and Friday Saturday night good music I just wish that the Dancefloor was more spacious and bigger can get extremely crowded and annoyed due to the limited space and people constantly pushing the way through and security guards always trying to make space when it's already extremely crowded and almost impossible to maneuver none of that still place I definitely recommend to check out but I wouldn't stay here forever the only plus about Bourbon Street is that there is no cover charge compared to the other bars that are charging like it is Vegas when they are not. Either way you pay for what you get and if you want a bar that doesn't have cover charge but still has good music and a nice environment College vibe then definitely check out Bourbon Street this post is only for those who are about bar hopping not for those who are trying to eat during the day at this restaurant</Text>

Nope. Slow af service. Food was sub par and greasy. Didn't tell us till after we ordered that they couldn't serve what we ordered on a Sunday. Loud. Water tasted like toilet water. Good music I guess.<//text>

Food is soooo good. Lots  of flavor cooked just right. Fish and Chips are perfect ratio of fish  and batter. The Lousiana Fries are delicious.  The Burgers are great. The staff rocks<//Review>

Decent place for dancing on weekend nights if you like R&B, Hip-Hop, and Pop music. The bad can be hard to approach (so have a drink before you get here if you can help it). Also, try the Jello shots they come in syringes, pretty cool.< /Review>

At night gets a little out of control. I was telling guy to leave my girl alone and the voucher came over and asked me what the problem was. He didn't understand me or something said I was lying and kicked me out. For telling creeper to stay away. There are to many good bars in dtf to deal with this one.<//review>

Visited Sunday, Sept 29. ~ lunch time. Entered, bar was to the left, asked a young lady (bartender) to pass a menu so I can see if they had my favorite southern dish. My husband and I waited and watched her flirt with the men at the bar. 2 other waitresses were also just flirting while one was trying to flip through channels trying to figure out how to work the remote. After 5 minutes of waiting, we got the menu. She passed it to us like she had no time for us. She didn't even give me a chance to ask a question about their specials. We turned around and walked out. Where was the southern hospitality they speak about?<//text>

I would like to point out that I am in the military and only carry my cac card when I am out. When I approached the door they said my army CAC card was not considered a I'D when it's clearly a federal I'D and when I demanded it to be used I was told I didn't look like military and was turned away.  Served 6 years and not once have I ever seen this happened.  The place was empty on a Friday night...thank God they didn't let me in anyways.  I drove 58 miles to this place and what a waste.

Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. And it's a shame because we were really looking forward to coming here for our first time in downtown fullerton. The security guard gave me and my party the hardest time and on top of that had the nerve to threaten me. Real proffessional. Not only gave me a hard time at the door but other people as well. Definitely do not recommend this place anytime after 10 if you want to be treated with any sort of respect.</Text>

< review>
I'm from New Orleans so my phone has a 504 area code, but I now live in Fullerton. They never answer the phone when I call to place an order. Tried calling several times yesterday--no answer. Tried several times today--no answer. Just tried again using my work phone (with a local area code) and they answered. What's a homesick guy gotta do to get some food from a place that capitalizes off the name of street from his home town? I've been to the real bourbon street like a billion times and it's nothing like this bar in Fullerton. Where's all the puke? Where's the strippers strung out on meth amphetamines? Why do I feel safe there?
What really pisses me off--you cannot find a barbecue  shrimp po-boy this good anywhere on the actual bourbon street. Bourbon Street is gross and a horrible representation of the city that surrounds it. This bar has good food. It doesn't suck enough to be called bourbon street.< /review>

<rate>2<//rate><review>I was shopping came across the coffee I like and saw there was a mistake its said price reduced $3.69 to $3.99 at the check out stand I brought it up the cashier attention and she acknowledge  it she brought it up to a higher personal because I took a photo and she literally spoke in Spanish saying than don't buy it assuming I didn't speak or understand her. I told her pardon me and she asked me if I want to buy it or not I said fine and still bought it. I posted a picture of the error.
So I returned back two days later and how they fixed the problem was by filling the whole shelf with coffee  nothing was address the mistake was not fix I posted a the chicken I purchased on top purposely to show the  new date of this new photo. word of advice to the (Owner) don't reach out if your not going to bothering addressing a mistake you didn't trying to be polite and kind.</review>< pics>

Authentic Mexican Cuisine. Best place to shop for low prices. Feels better than shopping at a regular grocery store. Best cashiers get you out fast. Best meat in town! Worth giving it a chance.< /Text>

<text>A nice location with a Starbucks in the same lot as a bonus. Inside looks nice but the produce section usually looks beautiful. There's 3 water refill stations out front and plenty of parking. I don't shop here that often but I have a good experience when I do.<//text>< UserId.>

<rating>4< /rating><review>Well truth be told this place is a hit or miss with prices and quality..but let's be real fruits and veggies aren't year round so it isn't always the stores fault. As for customer service or in this case the cashiers......likewise hit or miss you might get a cool one or one that is mad AF and doesn't even greet you...or makes you feel uncomfortable while scanning your things....or even more ive seen a couple times the cashiers shame the EBT peeps by announcing they are paying EBT...either way the store is always stocked with pretty much everything including things you wouldn't have never noticed...give this store a try im sure you'll find something that will interest you and for sure better and cleaner than El super.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
I went there just for the TAMALES.
I bought two dozen Beef Tamales from the fresh food/restaurant style counter, spent $39.85.  The tamales were NOT tasty.  The beef is not shredded but minced.  They tasted like a failed recipe, flavorless (as if they flavored it with cheap chorizo) with a very poor chli taste. NOT AT ALL what a tamale should be.   As if they were trying to conserve on cost and used the cheapest ingredients and or substituted with other ingredients.  Will not buy from there again.  Last few times I bought them there was about 2+ years ago.  They tasted just fine then.  But now something has changed.  Will never buy their tamales again, EVER.  Just wish I could get my money back.  Disappointed.< /Review>

Pretty good. Sometimes lines are busy, but they go by pretty fast. They're good about having people working the registers.<//Review>

The lines are too long only 2 cash registers open... waited over 30 min to pay and to make things worst my shopping cart got locked before getting to my car. A dream come true carrying my groceries across the parking lot worst store ever!!!< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I am very saddened to have to write this review but I feel compelled to. The beauty of having Yelp and being a fellow Yelper is being able to share your experience with others.

This morning, Jan 31st 2019, I was getting some grocery shopping done at Cardenas. As I was walking around the store I was taking pictures, you know, for Yelp of course. Then a store employee by the name of Aaron walked up to me and asked me "do you work for another vendor or some other company?". I said "No I do not". Aaron replied "It's because I saw you taking pictures". I told him the pictures were for Yelp. I asked Aaron "if he knew of yelp?" He said he did but it didn't seem genuine.

Aaron advised me that they have a "no video or photography" policy. I explained to Aaron that Yelp is an App where customers leave reviews for businesses and post photos of products. Aaron then said "he would allow the pictures of I left a good review" 🤔. While Aaron wasn't rude by any means, the whole encounter threw me off. I frequent Cardenas with my family all the time and may consider taking all of my business elsewhere, likely Winco.

After that conversation I decided to leave my shopping cart where it was and walked out. I called the store and spoke to a supervisor by the name of Manuela, she reaffirmed their stance on videos or photography. I understand that every business has a right to their own policies but I couldn't disagree more with it. So many businesses have those "people love us on Yelp" stickers and rely heavily on word of mouth. So many places that I have found and now frequent are because of yelp, because of customer reviews, and of course, those amazing pictures that people post.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c34c7996146f63:0x6d78d76fff05b1f5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I went to buy carnitas and specifically told the lady that I didn't want a lot of fat and to my disappointment half of it was just fat it's not the first time it's happened to me and at 7.99 per pound not worth it anymore for carnitas</Text>

<text>Good location but as most Cardenas meat is same price as any other Ralph's but with lower quality. Just my point of view but meat prices do feel expensive for what you are getting.<//text>< name>

<review>Anyone can come and purchase alcohol here and show no ID  and I confirmed it now. I had been to this Cardenas many times and the last time I was here the same thing happened where a young person was in front of me and they were purchasing alcohol and they didn't even show ID. This time a young man purchased a 24 case of beer  and the cashier did not ask for ID either. 🤷🏻‍♀️I mean I don't care but aren't the laws in place for a reason? Pos ta cabron 🤔< /review>< pictures>

What can be said about my local beloved Cardenas Market. If carbs are your game then get your as$ in here and get some pan dulce (latino sweet bread). They even sell delicious cake by the slice. More like a brick. Head over to the in store restaurant for a delicious Mexican food that had a bit of a homemade taste to it. Great butcher section. Also, they carry an array of Mexican candies. 90% have some type of chili on them but that's how we do 😀 Waltz on in and support your local Cardenas. For you vegans... they sell lettuce and celery and what not. Seriously, what the fu©k do you guys eat?< /Review>

I have always shop at Cardenas, but in the last few months I've noticed that the cashiers DO NOT want to bag your groceries unless you buy a bag from them 😖.  I even ask them and they say they no longer bag your groceries. I might start going to Winco, Aldi or Food 4 less where I know I will pay less for the products and I KNOW I WILL BAG MY GROCERIES.< /review>

This location in particular has undergone a renovation within the the last year and it's very much improved compared to its previous state. The quality of the build out is on par with that of the Valley, Fontana location, but in a smaller, slightly more crowded building. A very well stocked, organized, clean hispanic super market with bakery and full deli services. Prices are very reasonable, the produce is of a very good to high quality. It would be great to have more organic produce available, but at least what is available is of a high quality, so that's a plus. The bakery produces Mexican sweet bread and an assortment of cakes and desserts daily. The deli freshly prepares decent quality carnitas, chicharrón, an assortment of Mexican comfort food and tortillas daily.

<Text>We ordered a cake, we gave them 2 reference pictures, and the cake was NOTHING like the photo. Omg so so disapointed...how they thought the finished product looked anything like the pictures is shocking, the lettering looked like a year old did it. It was for my sister 50th birthday....this was truly a horrible looking cake...and expensive to boot. All we can hope is that it taste good...let's pray. ...all we got was oh we are sorry. Huh.....they couldn't see or even say prior to us picking it up..was Omg let's fix this..

OK well the cake was aweful!!!!! So much for let's hope it at least taste good.........nope dry as a bone, the Banana filling was missing. ...how can they charge so much money  for a horrible product..
NEVER AGAIN....
I could have baked a better cake out of a box, and let a preschooler decorate it and it would have been better....</Text>< pics>

The Only thing i can't stand about Cardenas is that's it's always so jam packed with people on the regular, so rushing in to get one or two things and rushing out is not gonna happen,  so forget about it,..but being very busy is always a good thing for the store and the consumer because you know the products are fresh< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I am sorry for this comment because I have always enjoyed eating here. But lately in the restaurant I have not been well attended, every day the plate is smaller especially the ribs that are my favorite dish, before they gave four, now there are three, they put a little lettuce and a slice of tomato now they are extra, and in the beans they garnished with nachos, now not even that. But today was the last thing, Mrs. ANITA ANN who served me the plate, broke three ribs and mashed them with the tongs, instead of carting them with a knife, gives the impression that she was serving an animal, not a person ,, The rib is seen, as a measure, if I do not see it serve I would not eat it, what a shame this is the way to treat customers ?? The correct word is the piece of rib looks bitten.

Lamento este comentario porque siempre me gusto comer aquí. Pero últimamente en el restaurante no he sido bien atendida, cada día el plato es más pequeño en especial las costilla que son mi plato preferido , antes daban cuatro,, ahora son tres,, ponian un poco de lechuga y una rodaja de tomate ahora son extra, y en los frijoles adornaban con nachos, ahora ni eso. Pero hoy fue lo ultimo, la señora ANITA ANN quien me sirvió el plato , partió tres costillas y las machuco con las pinzas,, en vez de cartarlas con un cuchillo,, da la impresión que estaba sirviendo a un animal , no a una persona,, la costilla se ve, como medida, si no la veo servir no la comería, que vergüenza esta es la forma de tratar a los clientes ??? La palabra correcta es parece mordida el trozo de costilla.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Pay attention to the color, smell and texture of ALL the meat, always put the blackest and green in the back of the showcase to sell it first and it's disgusting! I had to return shrimp that stank of the dead! And today I looked at another lady complaining about a piece of green and rotten meat. Just imagine that they prepare food from the kitchen when they no longer want it in butcher shop! Gross!

Muy desagradable y desconsiderado  que vendan carne casi oliendo a podrido!

Yo tube que devolver camarones  que apestaban a muerto! Y hoy mire a otra señora quejandose de un pedazo de carne verde y podrido.
