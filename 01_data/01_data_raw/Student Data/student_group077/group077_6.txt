< Review>
I have been a member since opening.  I people that say they are managers are rude and disrespectful.

Charging forntime when COVID was in full shutdown and trying to get monies for 5 months payment. Granted call was made to put membership on HOLD

This is a RIP off of senior population and there was no need to yell or be disrespectful because of their error.

Disrespectful staff Ryan Sandoval and General Manager Mike

Shame on you Shame<//Review>

Cleanest Golds period! Cleaning staff is amazing. Corporate Golds in Venice needs to learn from this gym.
Negative: The equipment layout is the worst. No rym or reason to layout. They must have hired a hotel consultant company for a pretty layout.
Not the best at putting weights away but much better than most.
They closed today for 4 days to make gym better 😀😀 I hope they layout is done better.< /Text>

<review>Staff is rude and discriminatory against people with disabilities. Apparently talking to other members and many prior reviews, the owner condones this behavior, by refusing to handle this internally.  A couple staff members are bullies and make the gym environment unpleasant and is shameful .This is a stain on the Golds gym franchise . Anyone else with similar experiences should notify the ADA and file a complaint.

Apparently your @retention team doesn't appear to be a viable option due to your track record. If you are serious about resolving this issue, a direct link would be more appropriate.   Otherwise I will be contacting every agency at my disposal. Thank you for your attention in this matter. 🤔</review>< Pictures>

<text>Another Incredible Workout at Gold's Gym, its my First Week back since COVID & I couldn't be Happier! The Facility is Clean & has Everything you Need! I was so Impressed with Jonathan's Customer Service, I wasn't even Technically a Member yet & he still went Above & Beyond to ensure I had an Amazing Experience. When I officially became a Member I had so much fun Signing up w/ Jordan that I lost track of time he definitely made me feel like I was making the Right Choice, he thoroughly Answered all my Questions & even gave me some Helpful Tips which I Appreciated! Definitely looking forward to my Next Workout :)<//text><time>1611448107474< /time>< userid>

<text>This gym is great from hygiene and overall machines being in good condition, the reason why I didn’t give it 5 star is some guests there aren’t very classy and would stare at you and check you out as if it’s a gym to find mates not workout. I had a guy once ask me if he could join in and workout with me and due to covid safety social distancing I nicely refused and he just gave me a dirty look as if I had to say yes! 😂 definitely not a pleasant vibe when your packing on positivity thru workouts!< /text>< pictures>

Totally unhappy.

Got charged for 2 months when the pandemic was happening and they were closed.

Was told that I had credit for 2 months when I come back or when they reopen.

I froze my account.

After they opened, I inquired about the credit and the Manager did not know what I was talking about.

I wrote this down on my notes and I told them too on the phone.

Fast forward to now, I asked to freeze my account since Oct and I was charged for Novembe 2020, December 2020 and January 2021 when it's supposed to be frozen and I emailed the manager / operations.

This is robbery.

You owe me 2 months and charged me 3 more months when it's supposed to be frozen?

This isn't the right way to run a business. And I am not the only one this happened to.

Totally unhappy.

Update MARCH 31st 2021

Contacted Retention Team, I was told they'd refund me my month this month, since "I couldn't freeze it." and it's been WEEKS and I have not received a refund. What's going on here Golds?</text>

< review>
I wanted to cancel my membership due to the pandemic and not feeling comfortable about being at a gym (as I am now working out at home), I decided to cancel and to find out that I had to pay a cancellation fee.  I also found out that the 8 sessions of private training that had been pre-paid and never used due to the closure of the gym because of the pandemic was not refundable, but yet Gold's Gym is charging me a cancellation fee.  I understand the Gold's Gym was hit hard and it's obvious due to the closure of hundreds of locations, but it would have been nice for Gold's Gym to waive the cancellation fee due to the pandemic.  But now I know Gold's Gym only cares about their profits.<//review>

Don't live in the area anymore and I haven't even stepped foot in the gym since I got the membership and they don't wanna work with me. Im not going to pay for a fee when they let me know if I moved jobs or residence that I should be fine but this was false. DON'T SIGN UP NOT WORTH THE HASSLE. TERRIBLE CONTRACT.< /review>

I was charged $49.00 even though I had called to ensure I canceled my subscription and it said once I had paid the missing bills they’d cancel and I paid it out two weeks ago and am still getting charged, now I have to say I’m very frustrated and annoyed that Golds is money hungry and disrespectful</review>

DO NOT enroll with Golds gym!! They have fraudulent and deceptive sales practices. They misrepresented their month to month contract and training sales. They immediately started drawing on my debit card prior to the date they said they were going to. Requested to have the money refunded 4 times. Sales associate lied to golds gym about me calling and REQUESTING FOR ME to CANCEL the personal training.Both general managers said there was nothing they could do! Funny,since they are the general managers. Also indicated they didn’t know who could help me!! I asked for documentation of our meeting. The manager refused.
Then QUOTE
“My job does not rely on one sale!”  Doesn’t sales jobs rely on a sale. Thought I would share with all!!
DO NOT USE GOLDS GYM IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY!! Go somewhere else !!<//Text>< pics>

Seriously it’s a health hazard and seeing bugs in pools is an instant swimming turn off.  I enjoy night swimming at absurd hours but I might start going to 24 hrs if the Pools are consistently dirty like this<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

As much as I like the people who work here I am frustrated that the amount of equipment that is always broken.  There are eight treadmills in the cinema room and at least two or three are always down.  Seems like an electrical issue as the outlets are on the floor and they seem to get abused but the management knows the equipment is always down and still the issue is never gets fixed.< /text>

Very crowded, even outside of peak hours, you'll need to park at the bank or grocery nearby. Floors always wet from mopping, none of the plates are round so setting the bar down quickly means it bounces into your shin. Not enough squat racks and no straight pull up bars. Stories of staff making fun of members leaves a bad taste. We were told there would be an outdoor area by the end of 2017, yet construction has not started. If you plan to do any floor pulls, squatting or pullups you are better off at a gym that has all of the basics. For most this may be fine, but these are essentials for me</review>

I have been a LONG time member which at NO time included a yearly maintenance fee of 29.99. My checking account balance was not what it should have been this morning and then I saw the withdrawal. I called the GYM and said I NEVER signed a contract to include this fee, way back when. They said Oh you paid it last year. I said well you owe me a refund for that as well. I was told a manager would call me in an hour. That didn't happen so I drove to the location and was told Mr. John Franko the manager was with a client and the staff said it could be a really long time to see him, like hours. The gym does not want to resolve this issue. I am really upset about this! I want a refund for every year I was charged this $29.99 fee without my knowledge of even when Golds started doing this.
Again I signed NO contract stating this yearly fee.</text>

I am still reserving my judgment on this one until I've used it for a little while. It seems clean & it is kept cool. The cardio equipment is about a year old at the time of this review. They offer towel service, a cinema room to watch a movie while you do your cardio, there is an outdoor heated salt water lap pool with 3 lanes, outdoor heated salt water jacuzzi, outdoor basketball court, gender specific steam rooms & saunas. You will find pretty much your usual machines & free weights assortment. There is a little playground if you need to arrange childcare during your workout. Obviously they try to sell you on training services, nutrition supplements & merchandise like any other gym. Monthly membership starts at $20/month with enrollment fee & goes up to $40/month. The parking lot seems to be very busy all the time...<//text>

<review>I tried to join this gym with my active and fit program which they accept. After sitting in on there 1 hour (timeshare presentation) I realized they were trying to sell me the personal trainer program. After I refused several attempts they tried to sign me up for the regular gym program and said the manager had to do it and they would have my membership ready the next day.
I called the next day and the lady said it would take 5 to 7 days. I think she just didn’t want to help me. I returned to the gym the next day and they said the manager would have to call me for an appointment.  Still waiting. Golds gym In Thousand Oaks and two other gyms said they could complete it in about fifteen minutes. I think most of the bad reviews are true.

The facilities are fairly clean, and they have a good assortment of things to do.
However they have commercials for their services blasting so loud from multiple directions that it’s disruptive.
The TV sound is 1990s tech so without added expense they are unusable. But they are now mostly all ads anyway.</text>

<review>Horrible management and they are a bunch of scammers. I called a month before my membership ended to cancel it and when I called again a month later to confirm that my membership had in fact been cancelled, they told me that it hadn't been done and that they had no note of me calling in advance so I would get charged for the next month since I didn't give a 30-days' notice. I guess it's my fault these people can't do their job and now I have to pay an extra month for a gym I don't even go to.

You're better off going to 24-hour fitness.< /review><name>Brenda Beltran<//name><gmap_id>0x80e82ece66d185f7:0x939930c1fa104e58< /gmap_id><date>1515706930892<//date></record></dataset><record>

I've been waiting on a $99 refund (required because of their mistake in the first place) for 49 days and counting. I've been told twice that it was processed; once on 3/23 and once on 4/6. I have been more than patient, and I'm still a member until my contract is up, but I'm beyond my wits end. Not to mention the general manager never once called me back about it.
If having money taken from you doesn't turn you away, maybe the fact that people apparently dye their hair in the showers (and leave the tubes on the floor and eat in the sauna (seriously- a full meal in Tupperware in the sauna), and eat on the equipment (chips and candy) will. The cleaning crew goes around vacuuming constantly, which is nice, except when they do it in the cardio theater during the last five minutes of the movie so you can't hear the end. If you speak to one of the sales people longer than "hi, good, bye" they will try to sell you protein or training sessions. The classes would be better if the sound system didn't cut out at least a few times (the teachers all have a great sense of humor about it and will sing parts of the song when it happens during Zumba).
I'd be willing to overlook most of this if it wasn't for the refund thing. The teachers, kid's club attendants, and the personal trainers have all been fantastic, but playing with my money is like playing with my emotions, and it doesn't feel good trying to go every day and knowing that someone else is going to tell you the manager is too busy to talk to you but he'll call you (and he never does) and that they all care so much but nothing is going to get done. For another week. And another. And another. I stopped going for a little while because it's THAT stressful.
There are a lot of options for gyms in Simi. I suggest you shop around before getting roped into a contract here.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Me, my wife and my two sons have been members for over a year. Me and my son have a personal trainer that we use. We usually have 6 sessions a week. Today we were in the middle of a session and they fired him.  Right in the middle of the session! IHe was an awesome trainer! He won personal trainer of the month. Him being fired was completely politcally motivated. I can't believe they couldn't wait 25 minutes until the session was over. So rude and right in front of my two sons. It's like this place is being run by 10 year old kids.
The proper way to handle this would have been to allow him to finish the session he has with his clients, or to let him give his clients notice.
I have been overcharged $10 a month for 4 months now. I will not be buying anymore sessions from this place and am considering moving my membership. If I can get them to stop charging me.</Review>

This gym is awesome let me tell you, you can usually get any piece of equipment that you need, or they have another version of it if needed. There is a plethora of cardio machines so you can always kill time on one of those while you wait for more things to open up.<//text>

I wish there was the option to do half of a star because that is how horrible their customer service is. Yes Gold's Gym is very nice and amazing on the inside, it would be great for gym junkies but most of us really aren't gym junkies.... My sister moved away so she canceled her membership here in June.. they started charging her again, $100 dollars and she wondered why so she went to ask & they said because she is still a member... she was confused because she ended her membership in June and now it's mid july.... speed up til now and they are still charging her 100 dollars!!! In total of $200 after she left.. these people just want to take away your money please do not go here... they only care about stealing from you....< /text>

<Text>If you like swimming in harsh chemicals and soapy murky waters as the pool cleaner is scrubbing the walls and all the dirt is pouring into the water and when you tell him to would you stop that and he yells and gets angry at you, then visit this facility.

If you like roaches walking on you while you are in the sauna then please visit this facility.

If you like a horrible customer support and none feedback from the management about your concerns then this is the place.

Worst customer care and worst experience in a gym

too bad there are not much choices otherwise would cancel.</Text>< Pictures>

So much disappointed with their shady signup process for 12 month contracts. New people who are signing up please be aware that their cancellation process is brutal. Simi Valley, CA location have some bad sales people who can go any extent for signing you up.
This gym location make you sign some documents during signup process, make sure you read each and every word in those documents. Never ever trust what they say and promise, always ask any thing they promise in writing.
Please keep away from dishonest sales people.< /text>

<Review>Nightmare! Gold's Gym took $99.00 out of my bank acct. w/o my permission or knowledge.  Email from Gold's Gym, of signed contract was signed by George (employee of Gold's Gym), on my signature line. What a scam - no a crime it's illegal.  Still waiting for promised refund 3 days, 5 tops. It's been two weeks. Now, they won't even return my calls. George just answered phone, himself. When I confronted him, he said, well theres the weekend. I said, it was a Monday and you said, 3 days, 5 tops, this is day 5. He would not give me a number to call, to verify, he was telling me the truth.  Now, I learn from a friend, theyve taken monthly dues for someone elses membership, out of his acct for 3 mos before he realized. Plus, reading these reviews  IM NOT THE ONLY ONE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO IM REPORTING IT TO D.A. AND BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.<//Review>< Rating>

<review>If I could give this place and their staff 0 stars I would. They fraudulently sign people up for contracts and then when you confront them, they give you the runaround. John and Jonathan the managers are horrible, rude, and don’t care about customer service. It’s taken over 4 months to try to resolve account issues with no success. Beware before you sign up there</review>< pics>

They are very fast removing several mattresses, box springs and dressers. Professional and courteous. Love the service and they are reasonable in pricing. They will give you a quote based on each item unlike others they will tell you the price when they are in your property plus their base pay. This company is direct to the point and i like it.< /review>

Communication about our pick up of items was frequent, complete, and helpful. We were also able to get an appointment quickly and it was a great relief. Our assigned LoadUp driver, Ryan, was very polite and communicative. He was also on time and quick in loading the items. All around, it was a good experience and I would recommend and use again.< /Text>

<time>1588951119530<//time><Text>The guys provided really excellent service.  They were near my neighborhood early and called to see if they could come early (yes!). They wore masks and gloves while in my house and were careful not to hurt my furniture or walls while moving a very big heavy mattress around complicated places.   I would give them 6 stars if I could.  And pricing was half what their main competitor quoted me.< /Text>< name>

From start to finish from scheduling to pick up everything was absolutely perfect ....and the 2 men that came could not have been any nicer, they were so helpful and I could not be happier! I will use your company again in the future and recommend you to all my friends. Thank you so much!! 🙂<//Text>

Easy to set up online. Would’ve given 5 stars but it seems that the automated appointment time set up online was erroneous. They have set me up for 1046am, but it seemed that they had overbooked and I didn’t receive my actual pickup until 155pm.
But the rep, Jonathan, was very responsive and contacted me early on to update me about the change of pickup time so I could adjust my schedule and things worked out. Humans 1 vs Automation 0......
The pickup was professional, and sanitary as both the rep had masks and clean gloves. Definitely need to work on their automated scheduling but otherwise, their rep saved the day, adjusted the timing and prevented me for sitting around wasting time. Would recommend but throw caution unless they fix the automated scheduling to be more accurate<//Text>

<Review>Azeem and Keith were great! They were picking up a mattress and pillows I bought from an online retailer. They made the process seamless. Great communication leading up to the scheduled pick up date and time, and the day of the pick up they kept me up to date every step of the way. It was easy to do a contactless pick up and email receipt, so everyone stayed safe.<//Review>< pics>

Easiest transaction I've ever done. Driver called ahead (while enroute) which prompted me to set the mattress and box spring outside. They started loading as soon as they arrived and all they needed from me was a signature. Overall, spent less than 5mins. Would use this service again.</Text>

<Text>I set up removal of an area rug, paid, and set up for a Wednesday before noon. LoadUp confirmed via email, text message, and phone for the pick up date and time. Noon came and went. After a few hours I finally called just to get a voicemail at 3 PM. A while later I received a phone call, where they asked for all the information I had left them on the voicemail and said they'd call back. When they finally called back again, they told me no one could pick up my rug that day, but someone was available the next day between 4-8PM. I agreed (because really, I had paid these people and drug it out to the curb for pick up). THEN, NO ONE SHOWED AGAIN. They did have the decency to call me the second time so that I could drag the rug under the porch since it was going to rain and they won't pick up a waterlogged rug. After this rug sat outside for three days someone finally picked it up.

It's nice to have it done, but if you want something timely I would suggest a different company.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Every part of this was so fast and trouble free. Honestly so happy with the service. One of our rooms flooded and our futon molded. I made the appointment two days in advance and they came and got it out i didn’t even have to move anything for them. The whole meeting took less than 10 minutes. They were communicative throughout the whole process. Very thankful it was so easy because i had been putting off dealing with it only for it to be such an easy process. Very happy i found loadup junk< /review>

So they rescheduled for the following week and that was a no show. I finally contacted the Better Business Bureau and LoadUp sent another two guys to pick up my grill. They didn't even have a hand truck, so I had to let them borrow mine.
EDIT: In response to the owner's reply below, my Order was #69194.<//Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
wonderful place to help out with the kids but the workers there play too many games with the hours and always sending you paperwork that you never received and never pay your babysitters properly which make you eventually use your job they really need retraining and they really need some customer service on how to talk to people and how to deal with situations they're very rude and the workers don't seem to really want to do their jobs and they seem to want to argue with you and always tell you no matter what you do they're going to be right that's not good customer service skills and they really need some training and they know you need a new fresh staff in here so that the same people don't keep working with the same people or nothing get accomplished they need a new boss from the headquarters that come down and watch over them</Review>

I have a family that has me provide child care to their children. It makes me feel good knowing I part of their lives to help them learn, take them to sports they are involved in as well as give the parents a break. And I get paid!</review>

<review>I always enjoy ordering form Gourmet LA Bakery my favorite is the Greek salad... ingredients are always fresh and I love the dressing they use. French fries remind me of home made fires and they give a generous portion. Delivery is also on time and friendly. I can never go wrong with any order especially with the breakfast options. Must try place!!!< /review><user>103369596062955785399</user>< username>

Good variety of sweet bread and cake slices (good size and very yummy). They also sell sandwiches and tortas which are also very good and reasonably priced.< /review>

<text>Love this place! Parking is valet only however it is only a brief stroll from my apartment and there may be avenue parking. they have the best warm almond milk lattes and the first-class iced vanilla latte i have ever had, it wasn't overly candy or bitter, perfectly balanced. The meals is top notch too, it tastes fresh and the quantities are large. they may be notable pleasant there and have reward stamp cards! The wait is continually surely quick, i get food to head on my lunch breaks and by no means wait greater than ten mins. one among my favored espresso stops in la!</text>< Pictures>

< review>
I've bought at this bakeshop some pasties several times, I've always been treated with respect, and professional staff, most of the bread is the healthiest. The bread and cookies I order have always been good, well cooked, and warm, not cold, like some other bakeshop places I've gone to, and the staff are friendly and courteous. I will continue to buy bread here!</review>

This place is next level. Do not miss out---go here immediately. I wish I could have the breakfast wrap every day of my life and the tiramisu was better than Italy. My heart wishes I lived next door to this but my body is grateful that I don't</Text>

<text>Just love, love, love my son's birthday cake! I sent them a picture of a cake I wanted and they did it exactly the way I wanted it. But more importantly, the cake itself is delicious. We got chocolate cake with chocolate moose filling. The cake is moist and not too sweet, just perfect! They will be my go-to place for cakes now. Thank you for an awesome job. We really enjoyed the cake.< /text></record>

<review>Love this place! Parking is valet only but it's only a short walk from my apartment and there is street parking. They have the best hot almond milk lattes and the best iced vanilla latte I've ever had, it wasn't overly sweet or bitter, perfectly balanced. The food is great too, it tastes fresh and the portions are large. They are super friendly there and have reward stamp cards! The wait is always really short, I get food to go on my lunch breaks and never wait more than ten minutes. One of my favorite coffee stops in LA!< /review>< Pics>

The place looks so great! Nice color and atmosphere.
Ordered royal milk tea to go: dense, sweet and warm. Great drink for a windy night!
We also had the creme brûlée and chocolate symphony! Need to go home and taste later!</Review><gmapID>0x80c2c64ac7ab519f:0x5b9f4740e032770</gmapID>< pics>

Always a tasty treat. Lots of customers but the line moves very fast so the waiting time is minimal. Once you ordered what you want, you'll wait until they filled your order.</text>

What's not to love about this place. They have great food, good desserts, freshly squeezed OJ and best Horchata Latte I ever had. Ever time I'm in or near Burbank it's a must to come by and pick something up.<//Text>

I went twice in one week.  I had the carrot cake cupcake, the coconut cupcake, gluten free cheesecake, and Oreo cheesecake.  None disappointed.  All were equally delicious.  Great customer service too.</review>

Hispanic bakery, not a big selection of sweet bread, have things like flan, slices of cake, whole cakes and they do take orders for large cakes (weddings etc). Big downside is the lack of parking and that it's cash only.< /Review>

Very nice place to go. Coffee is great,raw cakes too. People very friendly. We hope we will come back.Service was fast and coffee/deserts were good. Unfortunately no table service, which would definitely improve the rating. Decoration and ambiance are very good.</review>

<Review>Ok, so the customer service is not that great but if you want some fresh, right out of the oven barbari bread in the mornings, this is THE BEST place to get it. They make it in white and wheat too. This is also my favorite place to get eclairs with custard filling -- in mini or regular sizes.< /Review>< UserId.>

No one customizes cakes like Gourmet LA Bakery does!! Everything is detailed perfectly to a tee - but the aesthetics take nothing away from the taste of the cake. Oh yes her cakes taste as good as they look! From now on I will be going to her for all my special occasion cake needs! Thanks, Gourmet LA Bakery:)< /review>

Wonderful bakery to grab quick breakfast or brunch. It's really got some great cookies and rolls. Very fresh. You might see a queue. Parking could be an issue. I enjoyed Cheddar Jalapeño Stick, X Roll, Sheet Focaccia (Square Cheese) and some hot tea.Will come for more.< /review>

My proudest culinary achievements was winning competition.  So  being the cookie master I mean monster that I am, I had to come here.  The cookie is like none you've ever had.  The first thing you'll notice when you buy one is the weight of the cookie, its heavy, packed with cookie angel dust if you ask me.  Then the taste! .  Its heavenly.  The best cookie I've had!<//Review>

I only regret it has taken me this long to check this place out! I got the plain croissant (and it was warm!!!) and a kougaman - both were fantastic. The carmely crispy sugar on the kougaman was amazing. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their offerings.<//review>

If you are looking to get a cake from here, just know that they do not actually do any special decorations or even writing on your cake. If you bring in a toy or your own decorations, they will use them but for some reason they don't write or draw anything themselves...< /Review>

Stuff is always acomandating, place can be cleaner, floors are always dirty.
They need to use seperate knifes etc for the vegetarian sandwiches, unless you ask them to change gloves they will use the same for ham smndwich and for veggie sandwich.
Great juices.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Amazing Mexican tortas aka subs. The agua frescas are made from scratch with real fruit that they purée there themselves. I have had the melon and mango juices and you can taste the fruit the second you take your first sip. Amazing!!!! The owner is this beautiful lady named Lupe who has the look of a 30’s or 40’s black and white Movie star and she is the most humble and sweet person. Very accommodating staff and you honestly can’t beat the prices and the freshness of their food and of course they’re baked goods are something to be Marple that. I don’t give many places reviews because I don’t have the time or the patience at this place honestly moved me enough to do it for them because I can only wish that everybody would give this place a chance or I’ll try and see what it is that drew me to giving them a great review. The reviews about the floors needing to be cleaned Ithink have to do with all the foot traffic they have and they are constantly trying to get right on it but it’s allot of people in and out. The food looks Preston’s and extremely fresh and well handled and there looks to be no other complaints besides the floors, if any. Took my fire fighter friends there and we keep riding back when ever we can and my wife now asks me to swing by once in a while when she has a craving for Mexican greets and to our surprise, lots of great European pastries to boot! Mmmmm!!!< /text>< pictures>

Grabbed a coconut macaroon and a small horchata to drink both were really great. I actually had to turn around and get another macaroon tbh. Only 75 cents too. All and all paid $3.50<//Review>

Pastries, cakes, torta's, and freshly made juice. A coworker told me about this place. Torta's are four dollars! Sweet bread is a plus. Lady who runs the place has the right attitude! Great place and environment.</text>

The food preparation seems clean and prices are fair.
They need to improve the cleaning in the  eating area and buy more chairs< /review>

Limited selection of pan dulce & 2 choices of tres leches cake slices. Tres leche slices were subpar, had trouble finding the "3 leches" was more of a typical cake.  Seating available. CASH ONLY!!</review>

(Translated by Google) The delicious bread, the formidable treatment, the girls who serve super kind and attentive, the owners of the place even serve you with a kindness and humility that amazes FOR ME THE BEST BAKERY IN LOS ANGELES I don't want to overlook THE CAKES mmmmmh AND the price accessible .... The only blemish that I put on them is that THEY NO LONGER MAKE GRRRR SHELLS AND THAT IS A VERY TYPICAL BREAD TO STOP MAKING IT A HUG ... BUT I MISS MY SHELL WITH MY COFFEE WITH CINNAMON BUAAAAA HA HA HA GREETINGS AND GO AND TRY THIS GOOD PLACE

(Original)
El Pan delicioso, el trato formidable, las chicas quw atienden super amables y atentas, los ddueños del lugar incluso te atienden con una amabilidad y humildad que asombra  PARA MI LA MEJOR PANADERIA DE LOS ANGELES no quiero pasaar por alto LAS TORTAS mmmmmh Y el precio accesible.... Unica tacha que les pongo es que YA NO HACEN CONCHAS  GRRRR Y ESE ES UN PAN MUY TIPICO COMO PARA QUE DEJEN DE HACERLO           UN ABRAZO... PERO EXTRAÑO MI CONCHA CON MI CAFE CON CANELA     BUAAAAA         JA JA JA SALUDOS Y VAYAN Y PRUEBEN ESTE BUEN LUGAR<//text>

<text>Love this nursery! Prices are decent and selection is very good.

Best part of this nursery is its a drive through, so you can stay in your car. Just make sure to check out at the cashier booth on your way out.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwjtam4QZzXiogYjv4665m5MHOjxUQg1BL-eko=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUzlSdSrdrpOq3G8igXNSJ-O-8yjv_HuirV1xW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMU9HyPpBu76M93oND6sFqUyFH1jSwDPWrjmmtV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<rate>5<//rate><review>This nursery seems designed for social distancing. There's wide open spaces with a wide variety of plants. in particular, they have a wide selection of roses, which is what we came here today to buy. I was able to call in advance and confirm that they have the variety I wanted. We found our angel face rose and we're on our way quickly.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The selection is always incredible and the prices are great. They have everything from sod to large trees and they can do delivery. My family just loves driving through there with the truck and grabbing whatever we need. Keep in mind they keep thwir prices low but, unlike a big box store, you will not be getting a warranty. Still, the quality has always been fantastic and I estimate that 95% of the plants I have bought here have lasted more than the 1 year warranty a box store gives you when they charge 50% more.</review>

< Review>
I purchased 15 yards of amended top soil from this nursery since it was close to our house. After spreading it into our big backyard, I realized that it came with a ton of crushed plastic and other trash. Seems like they never screen what they’re composting. I’ve been collecting the superficial trash for two months and God knows how much more are sitting underneath that would emerge in future after each time using my rototiller. Don’t buy any type of soil from this nursery. Nuff said.<//Review>

The trick is to drive down the roads and load the plants you want in your vehicle! I could spend hours at this place, so many beautiful plants. Everything you need to keep your garden growing or get one started!<//Text>

The plant catalog on our website shows the varieties that we grow on 400 acres of nurseries around the greater San Diego area. It states that not all plant varieties are in stock at all times. We do strive to have a great selection of succulents but it is constantly revolving. Customers are encouraged to call or email if they are looking for specific varieties that we grow. On another note, we do not pay for nor have we every paid for or even solicited false reviews from our customers. Please do not make that assumption as we work hard to earn those genuine 5 star reviews. Also, if you are in need of help just flag down one of our plant experts roving around in electric vehicles, if you can't find someone just call the office and we will send someone to you. We appreciate your business! Stay healthy and stay safe!"}</Response>< GmapID>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>The Evergreen nursery website display a wide variety of succulent plants. But when I get there ,..their selection sucks. It was a total waste of time for me to go there.
I think that false information on their variety of succulent plants is just to get us to come to the nursery and hopefully force us to select a different type of plant.
Beware of reviews posted on their website that portrays the nursery as wonderful and outstanding.
They more than likely “paid “people to write to them good reviews . As for personnel available the grounds to answer your questions is bull.
If there is a person ,..they don’t speak English.<//Text>< name>

Each time we visit we are given in depth, helpful advice that allows us to make an informed decision on plant choice. They have common food plants but most plants/trees are for landscape. The prices are within range for the size plants you are purchasing.</Text>

Great selection, huge nursery you can drive around. Haven't had a lot of interaction with staff but always friendly. Plants typically healthy though have had a few duds. It's nice to have this instead of always using the hardware stores.< /Text>

This is the second time this has happened, and I am beyond irritated.  Called the Carmel Mountain location and asked if they had Carolina Cherry plants in stock.  They did not, but computer indicated Oceanside had 38.  Called Oceanside, waited on hold quite some time for person to confirm they actually had the plants.  Finally someone else came on and said "we'll call you back when he gets back in."  Did not call for 30 minutes, we called back and another person said "oh yes, we have them."  ARE YOU SURE because we are driving 40 minutes to get to your store, and last time someone was sure, the plants were not there.  Have you actually seen these plants?  Yes, the assured us they had plenty in stock.  Drove over there, on one could find them, finally someone turned up 3 ratty, dried out looking plants that even the salesgirl said "these look terrible, we can't sell these."  Again, they were apologetic, but a bunch of gas and time wasted hauling the trailer over there for nothing.  Carmel Mountain Evergreen is good, Oceanside sucks.  Will NEVER go there again, could have ordered them at Walter Anderson's and paid the higher prices per plant at the cost of gas, much less a wasted Saturday afternoon.  I sure there are plenty of good, knowledgeable folks who work there, we just can't seem to make contact with them before we head over to Evergreen Oceanside.< /text>

The selection varies, and what they have is very well priced and healthy. I'm a fan of California natives which is more limited, but it's always worth a stop to see what's available. It's a great (huge) location to explore and if you do you'll probably find some gems like I have. Great staff, too!</Review>

Great prices and such a large variety! I had no idea the property was so large. Be sure to grab a map. I drove/walked around some and was looking for a specific plant. The man that helped me showed me on the map where to find it. He also showed me pictures of similar plants that could work for me since the ones I was looking for weren't very big yet. I picked up some and a few others (I couldn't resist the 1.50 baby suculents). I plan on going back in a few weeks to get the ones that were too young today and I'm sure I'll find something else to add to my home.<//text>

The negative reviews are unfounded. I'm sure these reviewers have recreational outrage. It is a big nursery, yes, but their is not one nursery that carries everything. What they do carry they have plenty in stock and it provides you a choice to find some good ones. Stop crying about the customer service. This is a place more for people who know what they are looking at and can help themselves. If you notice they are always busy and if you flag them down they have always helped me. But then again I at least smile at them when I do. Huh, give respect get respect, what a novel idea.</text>

I am a bit of a tree addict- I have spent thousands of dollars at the evergreen nursery her on Oceanside BLvd. I have purchased 24 in Olives which are doing great nearly 3 years after we planted them. I have to Raywood Ash trees that were 15 gallons 2 years ago when I planted them. These trees where delivered with pest that almost killed them - however I was able to treat and restore them to full health. Evergreen is the best nursery I have found- always check for bugs as any trees from nursery may be infected. Overall I highly recommend EG.< /text>

< review>
I have over 20 various fruit trees on drip irrigation, planted within the last 2 1/2 months on my 3/4 acre Carlsbad property. ALL are thriving, with the exception of two Fuerte avocado trees I purchased from Oceanside Evergreen Nursery at the end of July 2013. Of the 7 avocados I have, these 2 avocado trees started wilting, and the leaves started turning brown almost immediately. The bark now has greyish streaks & all leaves limp & dark brown, but still on the tree. One tree is now officially on the brink of death & the other not far behind. My research points to "Verticillium wilt"

I have checked methodically to assure all trees had proper planting, mulch, and water according to the California Avocado Association. Again, ALL other fruit trees including 5 other avocado trees (bought at Maddock Nursery in Fallbrook) are doing Fantastic! A side note: I lived 3 years on rental property in Fallbrook CA, which had an acre of Avocado trees that I took care of.  NONE DIED or became sick!

I just got off the phone & was told by Evergreen Nursery, they DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY OF THEIR TREES OR PLANTS!!!! BEWARE!  Apparently, they are not only selling diseased Avocado trees, they DO NOT stand behind their product either! I can state THIS guarantee..... I will NOT be purchasing any more plants from them, & will be removing  these diseased trees immediately before they infect the rest of my new crop!

It would be better to pay a couple of dollars extra at a reputable plant nursery, that guarantees their plants & trees.</review>

We've always had a positive experience here.  I hate it when people leave reviews that do not contribute to actually understanding a business.  I don't always get a 'hello' there either, but that's because every time I'm there people are working their backs off.  Some of these complaints are worthless and do not contribute to an assessment of the nursery at the least, but reflect on the commenters' inflated egos ...<//text>

Modern Mounters were amazing! Arrived perfectly on time. They were very professional and friendly. They knew what they were doing and mounted my television in the perfect place all the while measuring to be 100% certain. Perfect job at a GREAT price. No cables show, and the TV is secure on the wall. I could not be happier. It was so good in fact that now im considering mounting another television I have!<//text>

<Text>Martine came earlier than scheduled because his previous assignment finished early. I welcomed him easily. He worked quickly and efficiently and he was done before I expected. He’s very professional and  easy to talk to, most importantly he mounted the TV exactly where I wanted and was finished in a very reasonable amount of time. Yes I will refer my friends to him and his business.< /Text>< GmapID>

Martin was awesome!  After my tech from another company failed to show, I called Martin. Within 2 hours , he was at my home doing a flawless install in a very very short time. He is a pro.  He was so crazy reasonable on his price. I gave him more than he asked

Thank you Martin< /review>

I trusted Martin to hang up high end art as well as assemble arcade machines in my house. He is quick, efficient, and effective when it comes to critical thinking. Quite frankly I don’t think there is nothing modern mounters can’t do. All his work turned out spectacular. I even gave him a more daunting task of installing hydraulic platform lifters .

This is the second time I used Modern Mounters. Martin did another excellent job mounting my living room TV, plus with my floating shelves and helping getting rid of an old entertainment center. I highly recommend using this mounting service.</Text>

Martín was excellent! He arrived on time the same day I called and mounted two TVs securely, efficiently, and precisely. His work looks great. He even helped me troubleshoot an issue I was having with a remote. I would definitely call him again to mount a TV, and I would recommend his service to others.< /Review>

We bought a TV and called right after to see if we could have it mounted. Martin was able to come over within the hour and hung our new 55” seamlessly while also hiding the cords and hooking up our Apple TV. He hung our old tv in our room, as well and it also looks great! I would definitely recommend Modern Mounters if you’re looking to have your TV mounted.<//Text>

He showed up right on time after confirming the appointment with me earlier that day. He was extremely flexible when I decided to have a bigger tv mounted than originally planned.  He was careful and paid attention to detail being sure to center the tv and then hide not only the tv cord but also a lighting cord we had in the same location.  His work was excellent, his pricing was fair and we appreciated his promptness in getting this work done for us.  I would recommend this company  highly when you need your tv mounted and I will definitely  be using him again.<//Review>< Response>

He was on time and patient; being that we were late and he had to wait on us. Very knowledgeable young man about the tools and alternative ways we could mount and devices that we could use for us to do it ourselves next time. Prices were affordable and he did everything fairly quickly, also went above and beyond to make everything look nice and presentable!<//Review>

< Review>
In the process of failing to put up a 65" TV with metal studs, my boyfriend and I dialed our landlord to double check what could be done. She referred us to Martin, and lucky us, he was a resident in the same complex! After getting him on the phone, he truly saved the day by arriving within FIVE minutes, ready to go! It took him less that 10 minutes to professionally mount our TV. His rates were super affordable, he's insured, and someone you can trust to relieve the time and stress of DIY. Best experience ever 20/10 stars</Review>

<text>I just had my TV mounted by Martin a couple days ago and he was right on time, professional, quick, efficient and knowledgeable. The wall in my studio was built with something different than other walls (as he explained) and he improvised quick and got the tools he needed for that specific wall and it only took him a few minutes to have everything set up exactly how I wanted it! Definitely recommend! Don’t look any further, this business is your go to for sure!<//text>< time>

I recently had Modern Mounters come out to my apartment in the La Jolla area of San Diego to do a TV installation.  They did a TV wall mount installation on drywall above my fireplace.  Martin’s service was incredible.  Martin and Ruth were professional, kind and very communicative.  I would recommend their tv mounting service to anyone I know</Review>

As the first tooth whitening, the process is simple and painless. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I bought the strongest whitening suit. After two 30 minutes of training, I noticed that some of the faded teeth had turned white, but compared to the baseline, I didn't see any significant differences in most other teeth.< /review>

As always, her entire staff continues to be very friendly. The hygienist is very thorough and continually asked if I had any concerns during her treatment. Dr Samet is an outstanding health care professional. I describe myself as one of the world's worst dental patients. Nonetheless, over the years, she has always explained what she has to do, why it had to be done, and how long it would take. She allays my life-long fear and ensures that I am comfortable as I can be throughout the various procedures she performs.<//Review>

<review>Very upscale space; staff was beyond amazing - very helpful and informative. They did an amazing job cleaning my teeth even though, admittedly so, it’s been years since I’ve been to the dentist. They laid out all my options and didn’t make me feel pressured. Overall, friendly; professional; and respectful.
I’d definitely recommend checking them out if you don’t currently have a dentist or you’re looking to switch providers.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I had a great experience  at Dr. Samet’s office. Did my teeth cleaning and teeth whitening. They also did X Rays and filled me in on everything I need to get my mouth back into pristine shape. I will be going back in a few weeks to pick up my customized whitening trays. Can’t wait.<//text>

Everyone who works there is kind, polite and extremely helpful. They manage to make appointments during my availability. When you walk in, you will always be greeted by everyone. Basically good customer service. Dr. Samet is always happy to see patients in a timely fashion where you are never just waiting while sitting in a dental chair, plus Dr. Samet is very nice.</Review>

Always very pleasant and professional staff. They also practice safe measures regarding Covid 19 in order to protect patients and staff. Dr. Samet's skills are truly excellent.  She is also very gentle. Miriam, the hygenist, is thorough and helpful for gum and teeth care. In good hands here.<//text>

Dr. Samet and her staff greatly relieve the “dental anxiety” that is often associated with dental visits and procedures.  Anxiety feeds off of uncertainty, especially in unprecedented times as now...her dental team diminishes the uncertainty and thus lessening anxiety. Highly recommend Dental Art of South Bay since trust, faith, professionalism, sterility and overall  first class service is everything to me and my smile!< /Text>

Courteous and helpful. We loved how they explained things and demonstrated such patience. The people are amazing and the office is beautiful. We had to wait a little while to be seen, but it was worth the wait. The office was extremely cold! So bring a sweater!< /text>

I find Dr. Samet's office the nicest Dentist's office I have ever been to. Everyone who works there is nice and treats me so well. Dr.Shiva worked on me and she was just great. So gentle and explaining everything to me as we went along. Everyone there makes each visit something I look forward to.< /review>

Dr. Samet is a fantastic dentist,  knowledgeable & thorough without giving too many gory details.  She makes the appointments quick and as stress-free as possible, even for a dental chicken like myself!
Thanks you to Dr. Samet and her fantastic staff as well.< /text>

I found this office through Groupon and was so pleasantly surprised. I ended up paying more for a deep cleaning, but I haven't been to the dentist in a hot minute, so it was definitely worth it! The office is new, clean and the dental chair has a great city view. Everyone was so friendly from start to finish and every single person working made my visit memorable. Not to mention they were all women! Go girl power! 😍 Just found my LA dentist, will definitely be back!!</Text>

Said she wanted to drill down a crown I just paid for
Then charge me 10k
And say she does not know of that will solve my problem
My suggestion is stay away unless you wanna spend money for no reason .
Came here for a cleaning was the most basic cleaning and she missed all the problem areas.
Avoid !!!<//text>

Her team was great and she did a great job explaining everything that she was doing and listening to what I had to say. After seeing many different dentists I can say that Dr. Samet and her team are the best I have seen and I will continue to go there and would highly recommend them to anyone.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Samet's office is a great dentist office. Her staff is so sweet & they know their patients. I'm getting my Invisalign treatment done from her, and so far it's going really well. They worked around my monthly payments, and appointments are easy to schedule. I wish they were open on Saturdays though! But overall, I'm glad she is my dentist.</text>

I bought a very inexpensive Groupon and went in not knowing what to expect. I was delighted by the beautiful office and greeted by Elizabeth and another very pleasant  lady (she has red hair 😊). I was taken to a room with a great view and had the best cleaning I have ever had performed by the meticulous and very gentle Veronica. Pricilla performed the X-ray and she was excellent and gentle. The doctor is amazing, beautiful and extremely kind. She took her time explaining what problems she identified by X-ray and examination and explained treatment option and possibilities. I’m a physician and non of the staff or the doctor had a clue, yet I was treated with out most respect and given a great deal and ways to finance the treatment. This doctor and her staff are the best, at no point were they pushy nor careless or discourteous. I have made an appointment to take my sons to dr. Samet, because there is no one better! Thank you and see you in a week.

Dr. Maggie Y.< /text>

Dr. Samet is very methodical and caring and she will go the extra mile for treatment dealing with oral surgeos. She has established a state of the art practice. She is a gem in South Bay.</review><time>1564799068026<//time><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

Dr. Samet and her team are all outstanding! I have been going to to see Dr. Samet for 3 years now and can’t imagine having a better experience anywhere else. From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed with friendly smiles which immediately ease the anxiety of being at the dentist:) The medical team that does the actual dental work are all true experts and work with precision and confidence. I really like how they inform me step by step what they are doing. They also offer pillows and blankets to make your experience as comfortable as it can be. They are all gentle, attentive and warm in nature. I have had everything done from routine cleaning to dental implant and Dr Samets work is always perfect!<//Text>

Not sure I like the H2O ultra sonic cleaning.
Very loud Hurts my ear drums messy water. I think I prefer the regular scraping with the handtools. The hygienist was very sweet.</review>

Beyond my expectations! Dr Samet has assembled an amazing team. I am a cancer survivor witph PSTD.  Her incredible skills and attention to details have provided me with the best treatment I can imagine. I had a general dentist say he couldn't help and to go to an oral surgeon. He (the oral surgeon) told me to go back to the doctor who had said he could do NO more for me. SO By the time I got to Dr Dana Samet, I was over it... preparing to be let down.  With a warm smile and comforting confidents  Dr Samet said she could more than help "I can give you a beautiful smile." Still a work in progress but I have gain confidence in my self. I hear people having much less work than I and the problems they have. Bone grafts, extraction, and implant post set. All work has heald beautifuly without exception. In conclusion I would refer even the most skittish dentist fearing people to Dr Dana Samet.

First of all I had a dentist appointment today and we scheduled it for TODAY and they called and verified it for today. So we called to let them know we are on our way and they said it's in December! WHAT?! I scheduled three days off just to come here to get my wisdom teeth out. I basically wasted my time with these idiots. UNPROFESSIONAL! Very UNPROFESSIONAL. The lady on the phone was very RUDE,and SNOBBY. If your wondering who she's she's the one with the red hair in the picture 😂 Lmao anyways... THESE PEOPLE ARE RUDE ALL OF THEM. So Unprofessional, what a waste. They should have the word "IDIOTS" across the building and their pictures. They don't care about you or your teeth. IF I COULD GIVE THEM 0 STARS I WOULD.<//review>< response>

She's a thief don't know how to treat her patients she always Steals from her patients she doesn't tell before working on your teeth and half through your treatment she says oh now you have to pay this much  if you want me to complete the treatment I don't know who has given her the rating which says 4.5 stars she should have the real rating which is 1 star so people know she's isn't a dentist it's like a ghetto auto shop where they play with you and still don't get your car fixed.< /text>

Angie was super communicative, professional, and informative. She made the viewing process a breeze. She listened with patience and gave honest answers to all of my questions. I have had some horror encounters with some property management companies on my apt hunt, but working with Angie was refreshing.</text>

Horrible company is an understatement. They broke the law and kept money that didn’t belong to them. I had to sue them and even with a court decision that determined they broke the law and ordered them to pay me back, they are still to pay me the money they’ve been keeping from me for almost a year. I would not recommend doing business with RPM unless you dislike your money.< /review>

Erica as on-site manager is very attentive and informative. She does an excellent job to always respond promptly to any concerns or issues we have in our apartment. Regarding maintenance concerns, Chachi has always done a great job with repairs and maintenance. We are very happy and satisfied with their professionalism!<//text>

Currently live here have had nothing but great things to say. Management is responsive and takes care of their tenant. Apartment is updated and very nice. Office staff is professional. On-site manager is also very kind and professional. Shannon and Danny are two of the people I have had the most contact with and they are very helpful professionals.< /review>

<Text>I bought a condo in Long Beach but I live out of state so I have to depend on RPM for almost everything. RPM has some great strengths. They take care of every aspect of the management if you elect for that option as I did. Once my condo was ready to rent they knew the market inside out and helped me choose the right rental price point. Then they got tenants signed within two weeks. This was amazing to me and I am very grateful to Perry Karn in particular. Communications were not always so great until I discovered Jae Mak, the accountant, who responds very quickly and is super helpful. One somewhat frustrating point for me was that my place needed a lot of work and it took RPM's contractor two weeks just to give me an estimate--and one which, in my view, was rather inflated. I found contractors myself. I don't imagine that most people need that kind of service, though. So, if you have Perry taking care of the rental and Jae taking care of money and communications it is a great experience.<//Text>< pics>

He was thorough and took lots of pictures but because he was so personable it only seemed as though he was here 5 minutes. It can be uncomfortable sometimes when strangers enter your home. I felt at ease and he was able to answer all of my questions. It would have been nicer if someone would have called an hour beforehand as agreed. I had a 9am- 5pm window. Perhaps in the future you could offer a 4 hour window. Consideration of others time goes a long way.<//review>< Pictures>

My experience as a tenant with RPM Southland was great. My property manager Perry was the best. He was helpful when I had any questions, and was always available, or called me right back when I needed to get a hold of him. Everybody in there office is very professional. I would definitely recommend RPM Southland.</Review>

<Text>Well the comparables in the area are all around $2600 and the shared entry points towards the back of the apartment is very sketchy considering the doors in the back are literally inside of the apartment. When we arrived there was someone doing yoga on the deck by the front door. If location, location, location is is what drives the rate. Clearly this place is just around the corner from a ton of riff raff, (vagrancy) and I don’t remember seeing protected parking etc. we would have to invest in purchasing blinds, there was wiring in various places. we will not be paying $3100 here. If we can negotiate $2600-$2700 it’s a go for us right now.<//Text>< Date>

If I could give zero stars I would. They take absolutely no responsibility for damage incurred under their management. Their team of handymen have destroyed my plumbing and the stucco of my house. They refuse to do anything about it and never answer emails or phone calls. I have proof of their lack of respect and responsibility for my property and even had to hire legal representation to challenge them on their lack of help resolving the issues they created. I cannot caution you enough to avoid them at all costs. I used them for six years and if this is how they treat clients they should be ashamed. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR YOUR RENTAL PROPERTY!< /text>

<text>They have been managing the complex I live for almost 2 years now.  Slow response(if there even is one) to maintenance requests.  Zero follow up on deferred maintenance inspections. We were without working smoke alarms for over 6 Months,  and presently the community dryer has been broken for a week.  When contacted about the dryer the response was “sorry the person who does that isn’t here”.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>From the first phone call with owner Miles, I was comfortable working with RPM Southland. He was very easy talk to about all my concerns renting my property. We then worked with Tommy to get our property rented. It was a smooth process and relatively quick, especially considering we put it up for rent during the holidays. Highly recommend!</text><user_id>117112084497791711113< /user_id>< name>

We weren’t sure exactly what everything would look like with Covid but everything was handled very well! It was a little difficult to get in contact with the right person at first but once I was given Tommy’s contact info he was very responsive and answered all of mine and my roommates questions.

Other than collecting the rent and taking their commission, there is very little that RPM does without constant follow up by the home owner.

I recommend using any other property manager that you can find.<//Review>

It is nearly impossible to speak to anyone about any issues regarding maintenance, overcharges, or to get a simple question answered. When you do speak to an actual person, they cannot answer any question. They are the one of the worst rental companies in Long Beach.< /Text>

Very impressed with this group. Originally I wanted to handle all the leg work with my rental property but I wasn’t able to with everything else going on in life. Ultimately I found RPM and I’m glad I did because they have done an excellent job with my rental. I feel confident with them handling everything for me and it’s taken a lot of stress of my plate. I highly recommend their services.< /review>

Erilai Obin, who works at RPM, was very helpful in coordinating the repairs at our property.  She was efficient, kind, and helpful with the different factors that needed organizing to schedule the repairs.  And once that was all set, her follow-up inquiry was much appreciated. Thanks Erilai!< /Text>

I signed my contract with RPM a month ago after meeting with a few different property managers.  I chose to move forward with RPM because Miles seemed the most genuine out of all them.  For example, I mentioned that I wanted to try renting my condo for high price, and the other property managers tried to promise me higher rent in order to get my business.  Miles gave me his idea of a feasible price, and it was actually the price that a tenant agreed to.  Katherine is the RPM property manager assigned to my property and she has been very responsive.  So far I am happy with my choice to go with RPM.<//Text>

I noticed one of their rentals mentioned a $225 move in/move out fee. However, in California the law states that a landlord can not charge a tenant any non-refundable fees except for an application fee. Can you explain why you are charging this and the legality of it?<//Review>

< review>
I can’t say enough wonderful things about Erilai. I have been using this rental management for 5 years. Recently i have been doing some upgrades on my rental while a tenant is living at the property. This is not an easy task to accomplish without upsetting the tenants with the intrution of contractors.  Erilai came into the picture and became my go to gal in getting the job done. She keeps me posted with texts, emails or phone calls. She takes ownership of the job and only reports to me what is going on and how she will handle it - she does not "pass the buck".  Erilai gets the job done! Erilai is my go to person!< /review>

He and his staff are responsive to my concerns, keeping the house in good shape at all times.   He does routine "walk throughs", catching little stuff before it gets costly.

Amazing;  My brother and I have rental properties in a few states and this is one of the best management companies we have encountered
This is a difficult property to manage and prior management company Green Residence Management Ahmad Bdeiwi. Disappeared , collected rents from our tenants and kept the funds neither did they return to us the deposits from the tenants.

Real Property management has been accountable with every dime<//Review>

All problems are pass before me and we come out with a solution.  I don't feel all alone in my decisions.  He keeps me inform.  He keeps on top of things. He's tactful, and very firm.  Which is need with my tenants. I feel that this is going to be a great partnership.  A++ to Real Property Management the company that makes you feel like you are their only client.<//text>

You can't beat Real Property Management! Several years ago we tried to do it on our own and regretted it. Tenants skipped out on their lease and left behind a garage full of stuff. We learned our lesson and wouldn't dream of renting without a professional service to help us through the process. Real Property Management is a great choice. Knowledgeable, professional, and eager to make your rental experience easy for you.<//text>

I am not happy with the result of my move out and being charged for things in the apartment that were either there from age or something the tenant is not responsible for. Also, the estimates of damage were insane. So glad I finally moved out of Long Beach.< /text>

It is a terribly run company. We were rented an apartment by Cecilia that had no gas, heat or running hot water. Two months later both Cecelia and Miles have been of no help and are incredibly hard to get in touch with. Dont rent from them.</Review>

I know this issue was a tough one to have to deal with right after moving into your unit. As I have communicated with you and the other tenant, the owner failed to let us know of the gas issue and was very slow in approving the needed work. None of that is your fault, and I do apologize that you had to suffer because of that. We do our best to deliver a rent ready unit to each tenant, but sometimes there are issues that are out of our hands and we get stuck in bad spot because of an owner who hasn't done their job.\nI hope the rest of your stay in this unit is pleasant.

{'time': 1518026447278, 'text': "Hello Marvin,\nI regret that you were unhappy with our service, for the short time we provided it to you. As I have conveyed to you in the past, I would be happy to speak with you regarding your specific concerns. If you would like to do so, please contact me at 562-270-1777.\nIn regards to your account, we only charged you for one month of management service. As a courtesy, we allowed you to break the 12 month management agreement, after one month and didn't charge any early termination fees. This saved you several hundred dollars. At the time that we agreed to this with you it seemed as though you were satisfied with this option. I'm sorry to hear things have changed.\nShould you like to discuss this with me, please give me a call.\nThanks\nMiles\n\nUpdated: Hello Marvin,\nThe reason there is not a deduction for $75 on your statement is because you weren't charged $75. You will not see a charge on your statement if we didn't charge you.\nI understand that you didn't enjoy our service, and that, along with the decisions you were making that we advised were not ethical, is why we agreed part ways. No early termination fees were charged, simply the management fee for the one month we managed your property.\nAs I have previously offered, if you would like to discuss this please feel free to reach out to me at the phone # listed above.\nThanks"}< /response>

I got ripped off as a first time landlord. Put your money where your mouth is and send me $75, as that deduction isnt even in the statement bill</text>

Your needs for prices at smaller than comparable stores.

Notice they have shoping carts in store only. Plastic bags are heavy duty at 10 cents.< /Review>

<Review>I love the dollar king, however I've seen better than this location which is in Glendale.
I am glad we have one in the neighborhood.
Everything is $1.11 but worth the extra $0.11 you can also find seasonal items and occasions decoration like birthday, baby shower and gatherings.<//Review>< pics>

They have the best selection and tons of quality items for a dollar store... hint... everything is $1.11. Great for party supplies, school/teaching supplies, storage and containers, cleaning products, hardware, PETS section is AWESOME! I probably spend at least $150/month here when I work in Sunland! :)< /Review>

Lots of unique and useful items for just over one dollar.  You will find many arts and crafts items that would be more expensive elsewhere.</Review>

If you are having a party a great place cards or wrapping paper, etc. I buy my trash bags various sizes, sandwich bags foil wrap. A decent stationary station. Just about everything you would expect to find at this type of a store. Plenty of free parking. Stop in and check it out.<//text>< userid>

<Review>The prices seem to be rising  very quickly.    Been going there for many years.  Most items used to be a dollar.   Now most items are over a dollar.   Rather go to the Dollar Store!<//Review>< Time>

<text>Dollar king is an inexpensive way to buy many items used in your home. Great place to buy party supplies and wrapping or tissue paper. Some office supplies are available too. Trash bags, zip lock bags, aluminum foil most things you can always use. Stop in and check it out to many things to list.</text>< Pics>

Lady in cash register was not nice when I asked if I could take in my tiny Chihuahua ... Bought some water toys that broke right away, didn't even last 30 mins. Quality was pretty cheap. I prefer their location in Colorado Rd , service is better and quality of their items is slightly better. Even their make up is good at Colorado Rd and I love their nail supplies for the price and quality. 👍🏽</Text>

It is a nice store and always has cool stuff, but I hardly come anymore to this location,because this is the only "dollar" king I've been to that has a price of 1.21 plus tax. It's disappointing that they changed the price and this isn't the first time.</Text>

Dollar king getting reputation for extreme unhappy rude workers and it is correct. I went in to this dollar king. Many crafting items which is nice. Everything elae same as 99 store and cheaper. The workers get in your way and ruin your shopping experience. They are nust unhappy and rude. Youd think theyd know they are lucky to have a job. Hire new workers.< /Review>

<review>I was in store today and during check out the register asked credit /debit and I said do credit please. Then she swiped my card then asked for my ID!!! I smiled and said first you swipe the card then you ask for ID?? which is funny. Then  with a very bad attitude she said WHAT IS SO FUNNY. The customer service of this store is very poor, the register was so rude and I won't shop from you again.
I just forgot to ask her name, otherwise I'd definitely mention her name.<//review><Rating>1<//Rating><Name>Martin Alvandi</Name><GmapID>0x80c2935962f81667:0xbb70f4cfb4fa4316< /GmapID>< UserId.>

<review>Unfortunately, they do NOT accept EBT. That was a real bummer. The staff is not that great. And not much variety. They have great aloe vera juice though. So weird that it's called Dollar King,  yet everything is $1.11 before tax; nothing is $1. Place is alright for an emergency only.< /review>< pics>

<text>Nice walk around the Green Belt which leads up to the park. It does get steep so a bit of a warning for those with physical issues. There's a residential area (cul de sac) to park at, enough for a few cars closer to where the playground is at. Large trees near the main parking lot for shade and cool pictures.<//text><gmapID>0x80c32db465ad905b:0x1645e6648dec55c8</gmapID>< Rate>

Nice park with a decent walk path.
Pros: Exercise stations along the walking path, picnic tables at the one area we walked by, terrain assists in breeze blowing along the path which on days like today was nice.
Cons: Path slabs in some areas are not level, either with the adjacent slabs or horizontally.< /text>

First time here driving one hour not really good experience:  starting with the service not very friendly, the cashier looked mad, the food was ok the fried chicken was good but the side i ordered beans and mashed potatoes both were cold. The mash potato difenaly  not flavor. So i give 1 stars. Outdoor patio but not restroom available. Place kinda dirty inside and outside. Pay attention on that please.< /text>

Horrible service at this location, along with way too over priced. The soda taste like WATER.
If they have outdoor Dinning, they should have the restroom available for the clients. Definitely last time at this at HORRIBLE place👎< /review>

<Text>It has always been a pleasure to come to this place even if the cashier have a bad attitude as if people were asking for something free.
My concern is about the cross contamination the supervisor who took my order with the same gloves she was wearing served my horchatas.
She went back to take another order with the same gloves took the tongs and prepared the order.
They must train their cashiers and SUPERVISORS
on food handling and costumer service.<//Text>< Pictures>

Really bad customer service i never write a review.The cashier
had a bad attitude maybe because they wanted to go home already ...she didnt give me the cup covers,they were empty where they put them and  when i asked she said theyre in here  with a stone face
meaning inside the work area.then I asked  for  ketsup and a younger girl  grab it and threw it in the counter  and  walked away.like youre begging for food, if you dont like working with the public look for a different job.this was about 2 weeks ago.<//review>

<text>Never a again will I be attending this place!! The fact that they took long to give my boyfriend and i our food, we had order two small meals that are one leg , one thigh, and a side. My boyfriend asked them twice about our food and they said “we will take it right now” never came. We still waited but we seen the people behind us that were in line had already got their food, but we patiently waited. Until I told my boyfriend let’s just tell them that it’s to go the food, we did tell them but yet they were making the food for us to eat inside until we reminded them it’s to go. Never did they even bother to start with our food once we had order it. Bad CUSTOMER SERVICES!!!<//text><rating>1</rating>< pictures>

Half of the chicken I received was still raw. The mashed potatoes tasted nasty and the fries weren't good but at least they were eatable. Brought my family and they also got raw chicken and thought the mashed potato was nasty.  This place used to be good but it's gotten really bad. Paid $40 for everything and I didn't get full since the food disgusted me especially after all that raw chicken. Don't recommend this place at all. It's just a waste of time and money.<//Text>

Arrived Friday night (4/12/2019) around 8pm, waited in line about 15 minutes.  Began to order but was told they don't have any chicken and it would be 20 minutes before any would be ready.  Decided to wait, (specified that on one order we wanted 3 legs) and continued with the order although they were out of several side items.  We ordered what we could and 30 minutes later we got plates full of fries we didn't order minus the items we actually requested and all thighs.  We reminded the cashier that one order was to be all legs.  She brought back the correct side items and three legs.  To top everything off all of the chicken except for one leg was cold!  WHAT WAS THE POINT OF WAITING 30 MINUTES FOR COLD CHICKEN?!</text>

What makes no sense is that we were going to buy food and had intentions of enjoying our stay, but they just had to mess it up. Never again<//Text>< rate>

I've visited this place several times. I realized they have always charged for a large drink which I never ordered in the past. Today, while ordering was not different. I asked why and I was told it was because they have not medium size cups. I was disappointed saying I wanted a medium drink like they advertise. After telling me they did not have any cup. The cashier went to the back unhappy and brought the medium size cup. Unethical practices, lying and hidding items to make and extra buck. Last time I eat here.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I really had the bad luck that every time I go I always ask for the well-cooked chicken because it comes out with blood still and they make me wait 45 minutes xq as they give me more time to cook it well! ... I get home and I find the same thing about Always raw chicken! It really doesn't work!

Realmente eh tenido la mala suerte q cada q voy siempre pido el pollo bien cocido xq sale hasta con sangre todavía y me hacen esperar 45 minutos xq según le dan mas tiempo para cocinarlo bien!.. llego a casa y me encuentro con lo mismo de siempre pollo crudo! La verdad no sirve eso!</Text>

(Translated by Google) They did not ask me part of the chicken keria and they gave me breast, they always give one what they want, they eat one, there were also no spoons or knives, it's the last straw, a place of food, where there is no cutlery, nor Dan napkins , there are ke orders and Dan reluctantly, there are no garbage cans anywhere or outside or inside, I had to bring trash, bones, napkins and glasses for my house, is the last straw in that place.

(Original)
No me preguntaron ke parte del pollo keria y me dieron pechuga ,siempre le Dan a uno lo ke ellos kieren ke uno coma,tambien no habian cucharas ni cuchillos, es el colmo,un lugar de comida, donde no hay cubiertos,ni Dan servilletas,hay ke pedirlas  y Las Dan de mala gana,tampoco hay botes de basura por ningun lugar ni afuera ni adentro, tuve ke traerme la basura ,como huesos, servilletas y vasos para mi casa,es el colmo en ese lugar.</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The service is no longer the same as before, that in a take away order before they put Salsa napkins and cutlery. And now if you don't ask for them they don't give you anything

(Translated by Google) Unpleasant a child vomited on one of the tables and we told the manager that if she could clean up since we were eating and she ignored us, we better changed the table and went out to clean until she wanted.
