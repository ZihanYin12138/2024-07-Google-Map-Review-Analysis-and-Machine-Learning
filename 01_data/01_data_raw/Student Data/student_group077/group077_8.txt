<text>I absolutely love being a vendor here!  The staff is always kind and cheerful!  Hopefully one day I'll make the time to explore the book store rather than just running up stairs to Marianne or Quinn (sp?).  My only issue is that there are no security cameras outside of the shop and the campus police only shows up when someone complains about skateboarders.  They should make an effort to have a presence in the area.<//text>< name>

< Review>
This is such a cute little bookstore. Great for book-lovers who just want to roam the shelves and find interesting reads! I love that they have a separate upper floor for poetry, and that they encourage you to stop and sit and read a book. They also have a lot of spotlighted books and staff recommendations that I feel like I can actually take seriously. If only I had more time to explore when I was here!</Review>

<Text>You can enter, there wasn't a lot of people there and there's no limit to how many people can enter in the store as of now. If you are looking for art supplies they're at the second floor of the bookstore. If you're looking for art kits, speak with the people working at the cash register.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Kenny at the bookstore was an awesome person and a great help to me today.  He walked up to me and asked me if I needed help, and was so nice during the whole procedure I thought I should write a review about his excellent work ethic.  He helped me find one of my books and we verified the ISBN number on the computer because I wanted to make sure it was the right one.  Not to mention I didn't have 2 of my syllabuses yet but he was able to find the books under my schedule.  A Huge thank you to him very cool and nice man.

Besides that the tall lady in the bookstore seemed like she was pushing people around, making things run slower than probably should be.< /review>

The staff is nice and welcoming and everything is organized pretty well with all the electronics in one area l, clothes in another, books in their own designated area, etc, which makes finding what you need so much easier unlike other university book stores I've visited which seemed unorganized. The staff seem to be well informed of everything whenever I ask a question they answer immediately and well informed</Text>

Love the CSULB bookstore. I'm a little biased though, because I'm Alumni. No Alumni discount. :( And parking is a bit expensive. I paid $10.00 for all day parking. I didn't want to risk a parking ticket.<//Text>

Only book store at CSULB, you can find almost everything in here located right next to the dinning plaza. Student ID services is also located in here, there is also a copy center and an electronic section where  you can buy anything from a headphone to a mac. It gets really busy during starting of the semester. For seniors you can also get your graduation cap and gown here.<//review>

It's very convenient especially if you live on campus. But most items are overpriced. If you want CSULB clothing just wait and see if it goes on clearance. Or just go to school events that gives out free csulb shirts. But most items is cheaper if u buy on Amazon, walmart and etc.<//review>

<Text>Nobody knows anything at this school. They are all students put in charge who are so clueless. Sorry, it's just so frustrating that it takes exponentially more time, money, and effort from us to get things resolved. Usually on a wild goose chase.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Good service and they have what the student needs. However, they may not have the lowest prices available, I do not feel that this detracts from the five stars. I would much rather have the better service with slightly higher prices, than crappy service with the lowest price. So yes, I like this place for my school needs as well as my student technology needs.</Review>

The books are a not more expensive, but they also offer the option to rent books and are understand about returning rented books. I had missed the deadline to return my book and thought I would get a bunch of fees but they gave me some extra time to return it.</text>

<Review>The Csulb bookstore is a complete scam!!! They sell books to students with extreme return policy limitations. I bought a book for $200 dollars thinking I can return it later. Its only the second week of school, I go to the bookstore later that SAME day to return it  because l found it cheaper online. And the rude customer service worker told me only way l could receive a return if I dropped the class, that l already paid for. Logistically, that doesn't even make sense. I bought the book for that class but since I want to return it, which will lead to the bookstore losing money, I can't. Scammers! The book store is running a monopoly system on campus.< /Review><Name>L Mom< /Name></record>

<text>Good items LBC. Prices are high on most of the items but it’s a great store.  The place to def find your CSULB products. They have a good color range in the hydro flasks and styles in clothes but hardly any small or medium hoodies or sweatshirts most of the time.  Wish they offered som student discount on products.

Plus, you can find a table to sit in, study or whatever. Friendly environment. Not very good option to resell the books you bought in here after the semester is over because they give you nothing for a book  that cost 100 dollars.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I needed some graph paper (the kind engineers use a good deal of, or used to at any rate) so I called to ask if they had a stationery section. The young lady who answered obviously didn't know the meaning of the word. "Is that a book?" I mean, stationary versus stationery. I learned that in 5th grade elementary school. "Stationery?" "No, I move all around!" 5th grade humor of 60 years ago. Or our teacher at least thought it was funny. Along with "Empty barrels make the most noise." Another line I didn't appreciate until I got much older. I think of it every time some loudmouth makes an absolute fool of him/her self. Dollar Store, known for serving primarily poorer people, even has a sign posting their "Stationery" section (alas with no paper with ruling to help me draw graphs, hence the reason for my call to CSULB). Maybe I will try 99 cents Store. CSULB Bookstore staff doesn't even understand the concept of paper or notebooks anymore--- from what I gather.  Do they just text everything? Even x-y data plots?   Does the latest Apple iphone do that now? No idea, but I doubt it. I also wonder whether CSULB engineering students ever plot anything anymore. Or do they just leave that to their calculators? In that case, how do they "turn in" their results for grading? is everything now just a b c d e "multiple guess" perhaps? Where even a monkey can score 20%?
I know the stuff I am talking about is still manufactured (even if slide rules aren't). They sell it on Amazon. The same light green colored stuff I used to buy 50 years ago. Even if CSULB doesn't.  TOPS Engineering Computation Pad, 8-1/2" x 11", Glue Top, 5 x 5 Graph Rule on Back, Green Tint Paper, 3-Hole Punched, 100 Sheets (35500)<//Text>

If you have the ability to avoid this place please do so. the lines are crazy the first two sometimes even three weeks of a semester. everyone is trying to get their books for class and so on but they are over priced and the wait is so long. you have to leave your stuff outside and then find the book which its either sold out or not the one you want then wait again a long time to check out. just get a 6 month free trial of amazon student instead and buy your books there.< /review>

{'time': 1449605298552, 'text': 'Hello Jorge,\n\nI’m so sorry you feel that way. I hope you will give us another opportunity to change your mind. The 49er Shops University Bookstore is a non-profit organization that offers employment opportunities and scholarships to hundreds of CSULB students every year. We also partner with all the major textbook providers, including Amazon, to get you the lowest price on all books. Check out beachbookcompare.com. It will give you our prices as well as those offered by our competitors for new, used, rental, and digital books. The pricing is the same as going direct, but shopping with us keeps some of the proceeds on campus instead of it all going to a for-profit company. Inside of the store we also offer discounted used books, rentals, and used rentals to save students money. Shop early to get the best selection and beat the lines. You can be in and out of the store in minutes if you shop the week before classes start. We wish you the best of luck with finals and hope to see you in the store soon.\n\nThank You,\n\nJared\nDirector - Bookstore Division'}<//resp>

<Review>Super bookstore , 2 levels all open space tons of product. I think I was the ONLY person in there. The prices are not College Student Prices. The sale rack was the big score. Those are the prices that the clothing with the college name and montra should be .  Seriously if they can afford to mark a nice hooded zipper sweatshirt from 40 to 15 the they should never be 40 to begin with . Why wouldnt they want their students to ALL be wearing that great gear everywhere. But at those prices they make it impossible. They wouldnt need a sale rack if the price point were obtainable.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>They are having a big sale today, the last day this year they are open. Big discounts, well staffed, well organized, and staff is engaging customers to make sure they find what they are looking for.< /text>< rating>

Convenient and comfortable but not necessarily the most cost efficient. There's a print center too! That's a plus.<//Review>

Place to buy assigned readings for courses and school swag. Doesn't have a very good bookstore for independent student interests, but frankly I doubt that many students want to buy books for pleasure anyway.< /Text>

The service is also fairly fast for a sit in dinner/Take-out. The prices a bit expensive but I can't blame them since they have high quality food. The staff are also very nice and funny to my family and me. I will HIGHLY reommend this place to tourist/residents looking foward to come here.</Review><username>Saul Rodriguez</username>< Time>

I recently stumbled upon this place while searching for a Thai place near by. So grateful to have found a place where most items can be made vegan, so this is a great place for vegetarians and Vegans. Lately most places that offer meatless dishes lack of flavor and they serve small portions. Not this place, prices are fair and the portions are good, my family and I always leave with a happy belly and delighted by the friendly service.<//Text>

We got the Pad Thai, fried rice, and beef broccoli. It was some of the best Thai I’ve ever had although the beef was a little rubbery. The service was fast and the waiter was very sweet and attentive. 10/10 will be back again.< /Text>

This is one of my favorite places to get thai food! Everything is delicious and they are usually quick to serve. I often order to pick up and I don't normally have to wait long until the food is prepared. Food is reasonably priced and the thai tea is great! It's also a pretty decent spot to dine in at so all in all it's a nice restaurant. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys thai food.<//Review>

<text>My fiance and I come here, and always get a soup with rice, which is always delicous, as well as two dishes for the main meal. Broccoli delight with shrimp is cooked perfectly and the shrimp is succulent. The second dish being usually Pad Chow Mein for my fiance which she loves. Staff is friendly and attentive.

The food here is delicious! Tom Kha soups are to die for. Can't go wrong with Pad see ew and pad thai noodles. spicy shrimp is also yummy. Great service if you dine in or you can always do takeout. Either way they will not disappoint.< /text>

<Text>I had an IPod tripod accident and my screen completely shattered. I am using this for my YouTube channel and work, so I was worried. It’s a tough time for everyone and I was very stressed. The very next day I found NextGen and they quickly offered to repair it same day with an appointment. Can’t get any better/faster service.  Clear pricing and services explained. Definitely would share my positive experience with my friends and family. Thank you guys.<//Text>< pictures>

I was charged a little bit more than expected but Daniel called to make the situation better and even threw in a free screen protector for my other phone which is much appreciated. They are fast and efficient. If you have any issue, they will work it out to make sure the customer is satisfied, great. customer. service. Thank you.< /Review>

Came in to get my screen Replaced and specifically asked the guy About the quality of the screen that he’s giving me.
He said it was a decent screen it’s aftermarket it’s a good one.
That was not the case my screen lags/freezers/ and the 3D Touch does not work like I would expect it to.
since the first second I got it fixed
Came back to the shop to see what is there that we could do about it and he got really defensive and started saying stuff like I don’t care by your problems this is how it is.Came back to the shop to see what is there that we could do about it and he got really defensive and started saying stuff like I don’t care by your problems this is how it is
Was extremely rude.
People like that should not be in business.
I do not deserve public money
And I paid over $70 for this garbage.

Do not waste your time here. I called on april 1rst for a quote on my tablet. He said he would fix my tablet for 55. Two days later i called again but he told me he was going to charge me 65. I asked him why he increased the price  if he told me it was 55. He said maybe  i spoke to someone else. But, i remember his voice and it was him.  But, he end up giving me a "discount" I took my tablet on a Saturday to reset it since it didnt let me reset it. He said to pick it up on monday. I called monday at 3pm he did not had it ready. I called Tuesday and same thing. Wednesday too. On Wednesday i told him i really needed my tablet to do my online test from school.  He said he would have it ready before 2. At 2 He told me he tried to fix it but he couldn't. I end up taking it home but way worse. When i turned it on all it says is the brand of the tablet.   Now i have to buy another tablet.  This is a waste of time to be honest.  Besides all this, he gives you a bad attitude.  He is not professional.  I do not usually give bad reviews but this one definitely was a bad experience.<//Review>

This place is great! They fixed my iPhone 8 LCD screen in less than 15 minutes. The prices are very affordable as well. Don’t waste your time going to the Apple store this place can get it done in less than half the time and price.

Would highly recommend!< /text>

Highly recommend using them for your phone repair needs.

Took my wife's phone to then with a speaker issue.

Came out with a better understanding of the issue along with a fix within 30min.

My second positive experience at this place. Went in to have a cracked screen repaired and was told it was only the screen protector and not my actual screen.

Very honest and knowledgable when is comes to repairing my wireless gadgets

My charging port on my cellphone gave out finally after wiggling it for it to work for months.

This place made it easy for me to get back in business in a short period of time

Alyssa had my charging port repaired and done within a hour.

Overall satified with the service!</review>

Alyssa is the best technician hands down ! Her customer service is truly the best. She is very thorough with her work.

The team at nextgen wireless always goes above and beyond to help me with any repair and I will definitely recommend nextgen to anyone I know who needs any cellphone or tablet repair .

I brought in my Samsung note 3 that kept power cycling and I really needed pictures and videos to be taken out. She  was actually able to get the phone back to a working phone and also extracted the photos and
videos for me ! :-)< /Text>

<text>Brought my cell phone in to have the cracked screen replaced.  When it was replaced, it wasn't completely set and I was told that it would settle into place and if it didn't to just bring it back and they would take care of it.  I brought it back because the bottom of the touch screen was unusable and I was told that I'd have to pay to have it repaired.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Danny Casteñeda is a great businessman and knows his craft.
He delivers what he promises and listens to your requests. He replaced the LCD assembly on my iPhone 6 Plus without any delay or misquotes.
The shop is clean & professional in appearance.
NEXTGEN has my business and my referrals from now on!

Just got confirmation that my ipad was succefully repaired!

Couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Convenient location next to my favorite brewery tasting bar!

Dropped off my ipad for repair had two brews across the street came back & it was finished.

David is a wiz!</Text>

<Review>Any fool can fix an iphone.  It takes a pro to dig down and fix what others won't or can't.

My wife has a Moto G4 that she is very happy with.  She fell and the phone took the brunt of the fall resulting in a cracked screen.  Called several highly rated repair shops and no one would touch the Moto G4.  Called Nextgen with no real hope of getting the phone fixed.  Spoke with Danny.  Had to wait about 30 seconds while he checked availability for the screen.  Comes back and tells me he can do it for $95 but I have to wait 3 days for the part to come in.  I was happy as a pig in poop; none of the other highly rated shops would even touch it.  All this was on Thursday.

As promised got called on Monday and picked up the phone in the afternoon.  Phone looks new and works great.  Very, very happy with the entire experience.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< time>

Was driving by Ventura Blvd looking for a place to chill and eat when this place caught my eye, I turned back went in and this place is set up beautifully with all the wine fridges. The pizza is crispy, soft, and non greasy. Haven't been in the valley for awhile but coming to this place is telling me to come back home 😆<//Text>

I warmed it up in the oven today to eat some leftovers and OMG Tasted even better today. I’ll definitely be ordering pizzas here again. I got the spaghetti meatballs & pappardelle bolognese from the 2 bolognese was our favorite. Meatballs were a little too Dry and needed flavor the spaghetti sauce needed a lil more Kick to it.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIESY4UkLRK1Kts2WfYmOLi4FALJXkDBt_H8X1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCGnIXDVAf7qYMwHOjpAF94HoxIK3F_j6kZZXY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c29759867adfb1:0x899d31670f307d53< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Honestly i came to this restaurant because I read the good reviews and saw the positive stars people
Gave them. I am so dissatisfied and disappointed by this place  . We came 02/22/21 to order 2 chicken piccata plates and a house salad. Spent 67.00 dollars on those three items. Got home to under cooked chicken breast, no pasta who eats chicken piccata without pasta ????  The salad was bland just goat cheese and pecans and two pieces of bread 🥖. So disappointed I didn’t even call and complain because is not worth the time or fuss. Just completely over priced for low quality and incomplete food.</text>

This place really deserves an 8 star rating. Service was out of this world. The food was amazing. We ordered a thin crust pizza, the crust was thinner than a saltine cracker but oh my gosh. It packed so much flavor without it being all bread. The thin crust was not overly crunchy, just simply perfect. The alcoholic cocktails are made with 3 OZ. of alcohol instead of the average 1 OZ!!! Spectacular prices, extremely clean, cozy, and a great lunch menu. It is divided into 2 sections. Half as a restaurant with quiet dining and the other half sells alcohol; multi-functioning as a liquor store and provides the take-out orders. I believe they sell all the bottles they serve in house. EVERYTHING IN THIS RESTAURANT IS HOMEMADE. We came here with no expectations but they really blew any possible judgements away. Will continue to recommend and come back. Perfect view and location right on Ventura blvd in Sherman oaks, close to studio City.<//text>

<Text>As authentic as it gets. A balanced pizza where the ingredients speak for themselves. The cheese, the tomato sauce, the olive oil, and the fairly thin, crunchy yet tender crust are evenly discerned. A go-to for a seasoned traveller longing for a local Italian trattoria off the beaten path.</Text>< rate>

<Review>I've been twice for a weekend lunch so far, and each time has been great. The first time I ordered the ravioli zucca and I'm currently having the linguini vongole. The food comes out fast, although it hasn't been busy each time I went.

Entrées run about $20 a plate. I can't recommend this place enough. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had.<//Review>< Pics>

Very warm and familial service with real Italian chefs. The lady behind the counter on Friday and Saturday is a wonderful historian and mixologist, changing out the specialty cocktails every week-I mean they have chartreuse!

Negroni and Aperol spritz were very well balanced with her homemade, organic bitters.

I had the pappardelle pasta which was very good and the magherita pizza was hearty. I might recommend less cheese and more basil. Tiramisu was exceptional, so well balanced with the coffee fallacies and fluffy vanilla exterior</review>

Amazing. Come here for the deep dish. DEEP DISH!!! Pollo is my favorite. Do half and half if you want to try something else. But definitely get the POLLO.< /Review>

I love Trattoria  del Sole.   It has become my favorite ... my "go- to" Italian restaurant.  The food is delicious, the staff delightful....and it's warm and cozy.  Never fails to please.</text>

<review>Service was impeccable. Clean and comfortable interior. Perfect ambience for dinner with friends or family. We had the pappardelle bolognese and spinach ricotta ravioli. Both excellent.
The waiter mentioned they are expanding and will be making pasta from scratch onsite in the near future, so it sounds like it will only get better.</review>< pictures>

WORSE CAR RENTAL!!!!!!!

We had trip planned and end up missing flight and 2 appointments. Early in the morning we found out from workers that our car was broken and is not drivable. No one called us in advance and they didn’t solve our issue!
So we missed everything !!
I end up asking to get any car.  They gave me corolla for the price of SUV that we paid through the website.
Girl at the Register could not give us refund because she didn’t know how.
Trip is ruined. Money wasted ! Thanks Hertz

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS location<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c295d483193ec5:0x4fb54722b1af110a< /Gmap_id>< username>

I had a PREPAID rental to be picked up at 530pm, to drive across country the next morning at 4am. This location decided to close the doors early for the day.  I showed up at 505pm and they were CLOSED but the hours say and show 6pm!  How. When I have a PREPAID RENTAL!  Oh, and when I went in to speak of the issue, Amber was more than irritated and unwilling to listen or help.  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HERTZ, go to another hertz, or enterprise instead. THIS HERTZ LOCATION IS THE WORST!<//Text>

<Review>I had a mixed experience with this car rental service, so I would recommend using caution if you have to use them. We were having our car repaired just down the street at CBS auto (I posted a separate review for them) and Hertz was within walking distance of the repair shop, so we rented a car from them. I had to return the car a few days later, because the brake pads were worn out. I obtained a second vehicle without any problem with their apologies. I took out the company insurance on the vehicle and was glad I did, because I experienced a hit and run. Thankfully, I had my own photos of what the vehicle looked like prior to my driving it for the first time as there was prior damage not incurred by me. After returning the vehicle, I paid remaining fees with my bank card and then realized a month later they had charged my credit card the exact same fees. They got paid twice! To be fair, I never called them to have it corrected, because at the time I was dealing with a life and death situation and was at the hospital with a family member. I recommend using only one method of payment and staying aware of exactly what you are being charged in case of mistakes. Ask questions every step!

Pros:  Employees were polite
Wait time was reasonable
Had available vehicle to meet my needs

Cons: Was given a car that needed some repairs
Was charged twice (once on check card and a second time on credit card).< /Review>< name>

This company deserves more than five stars.
From the very first moment that I walked in the entire staff was so welcoming, I was acknowledged right away. I am not surprised because their manager is Anna, and she has an amazing team. She provided the very best customer service, helped me rent an affordable car. Anytime I am in need again I will definitely go back, and refer friends of course. Lately, majority places that I go I realize that customer service has declined, but when I had this wonderful experience I understood that I shouldn’t be hopeless, because great still exists. Thank you Anna for your professional service, thank you Hertz staff.<//text>

Polite service, but the vehicle wasn't ready until an hour after the reservation I made ahead of time. Then half an hour down the road after their heavy air freshener worn off, I could tell the car had been smoked in. The smell was strong enough that I ended up exchanging the vehicle at a different location. Not what I signed up for.

When I returned a different vehicle to this location, they didn't ask why. *Maybe* the other Hertz noted in the system why, or this location knew they had loaned me a trouble vehicle from the get go and were glad to see it gone from their inventory (at my expense).< /review>

Do not trust online quotes or car availability. We reserved a car online and after taking a taxi there we were turned away because there were none on the lot despite what the website said (but they of course offered an expensive upgrade). They checked the "surrounding area" and found nothing to avail. Our first other Hertz we personally called had our car. Make sure to call first and confirm even after the online confirmation!<//text>

Worst experience ever !, guy in front desk was very rude,  who refused to  said his name, got ther and tell him : I haved a reserved rent car thru their website,  and got there to pick up the car, but the guy just look at me and said : there is not a reservation.
And after that just look away as if no body was there!
Never coming back to this place.😖<//text>

While Hertz, as a company, has a lot to do with the sub-par experience, it seems that the bottom of the barrel was scraped to find such low-quality and underachieving employees for this particular branch.

(Translated by Google) I rented a car and I forgot something inside. When I went to see if I could recover what I lost, they never knew where the car I rented was or when it was returned. The person who worked there told me that the manager was going to call me to help me and I'm still waiting for the call. Very bad experience with them. I do not recommend it. They have no idea where their cars are, they have no control of anything.

(Original)
Renté un carro y se me olvidó algo dentro. Cuando fui a ver si podía recuperar lo que perdí, nunca me supieron decir donde estaba el carro que renté ni cuando lo regresaban. El que trabajaba ahí me dijo que la manager me iba a llamar para ayudarme y todavía estoy esperando la llamada. Muy mala experiencia con ellos. No lo recomiendo. No tienen idea de donde andan sus carros, no tienen control de nada.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Empty tanks, dirty cars treat you like you're lending a car, like you won't pay for it. Rami if he is understandable and polite the rest treat you like rubbish, bad experience in this place.

Illusions is terrific. It's got a modern design, lots of room, natural light, great product selection but the best part is the talented and genuinely kind people working here. I am always happy and feel uplifted when I leave this salon.</Text>

I have been going to Illusions Unlimited for many years and I drive from Tustin to have my hair done by the wonderful John Walden. Oddly enough, we have the same last name but, we are not related. I always feel like a new woman when I leave, after John works his magic. John is a positive person so besides getting my hair done, I feel uplifted in spirit.< /review>

Maria my stylist is amazing! She's been cutting my hair for years! I 1st met her when I got a REALLY bad hair cut from someone else at a different salon. She did her best to fix the terrible cut. (There was no saving it. Only cut it super short and wait for it to grow out) I will never go to anyone else EVER again! Thank you Maria for always making me feel wonderful when I leave the salon!< /review>

I love this salon because Mirna, my hairdresser is a true professional at haircuts and color. Her prices are reasonable as well, for someone like me with a ton of thick hair. I highly recommend Mirna Sandoval.< /Review>

<review>I found Lori many years ago and keep coming back because she rocks!  I have fine hair and she has fine hair so she knows what will work with my hair.  If I come in with a picture of something that just will not look right on me she will let me know and suggest something else. Also the salon very clean, nicely decorated and  everyone there is friendly.<//review><name>Treana Hansen</name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1531000712784< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate>< user>

This is one amazing place, now Im not actually a woman, but my wife and two daughters sure are and they love Lori and the team. My daughter actually flies home from San Francisco to get her hair cut at Illusions. This place is a real gift to our community! Great prices and professional strength hair care products are found there as well!</Review>

<text>I had my hair colored here and the colorist did a really good job. The stylists seem really good too. But when I went to pay, the salon manager was at the desk, and she really doesn't seem to care about customers or customer service. She ignored me for a long time even though I was right in front of her, and she was really unfriendly. Although the people that work there seem good, the manager doesn't make you want to come back.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Looks like maybe new management over what used to be La Fortuna Market? They spiffed it up with nicer grocery shelves and look like they have so much more ethnic food. The Mediterranean/Middle Eastern sections has so many options! I am pleasantly surprised!

They pretty much have all the basics you need without having to go to a Safeway which is nice 👍</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObhoji3H006QvdjnkEiB10gWU7nORVTjKstOiA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsKITjha6Pz_WgVEcVandf13RB6FC5peZVS-Eq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMs0lI9OPInoKIRZOw3t4lcPfZ66e3ZLyuH3d0O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF-loLbFj70i0qrau1-EW2akJkO0BIY_hIBhWu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>{'time': 1592354371214, 'text': 'Thank you Jamie!

One of my favorite spots to get some quick mexican food and groceries when visiting the area. It's tucked in near some Hotels and in a residential neighborhood. If you are near here, swing in. Their deli is GOOD!<//review>

Great market! Taqueria is excellent! Fresh meats, produce, dairy, all available!
The only place in our neighborhood...if you need it, they have it... plus the owners are very kind! Also, they have lots of ice cream, American and Mexican!!
Not to mention lots of delicious Middle Eastern foods! Just curious why one of the ownero suv license plate says “hero”? Must be a good story behind that😉</text>

<review>BEWARE, bad practice. I placed an uber eats order with them for 2 meals and 2 sodas cost $20. They canceled my food order but delivered 2 sodas causing me to pay $9 for 2 cans of soda. What they should have done was contact me as other restaurants have or canceled the order completely. Disappointed to say the least, will not give this establishment my money or recommendation EVER!</review>< resp>

Working with the team at J & M Trophies was fantastic. The guys there was easy to work with and did a fast and awesome job with etching a wooden box and trophy for me. I wanted to check out the place and they were kind enough to show me the machines that they use in the back.

Definitely would come back here to take care of any future jobs. Thanks guys!< /Text>

I needed a last minute job from them in 10 days, received the finished project in 7. I worked closely with Joy via email and telephone calls and she was easy to communicate with, responded in a timely manner, and answered all of my questions. They have a huge variety of trophies, engravings, plaques, and what they do not carry in-store, they can order and get delivered in one business day. Highly recommend their service! Their prices are affordable, their products of high quality. Will continue to do business with them in the future :)< /text>

Wonderful service, wonderful turnaround time and friendly staff he won't go wrong if you trust J&M with your project. J&M engraved about 40 items for my wedding. If I had to do it all over again I would definitely use them again.

As the President of Senior Wellness Dynamics Inc., a quality image and reputation is paramount. I've been a customer of J&M Trophies since my organization was formed and couldn't be happier with the quality work they do. Joy, the owner, is very professional and meticulous about the work they produce. I'll continue to utilize J&M Trophies as an asset to my company's growth.

J & M Trophy provides excellent quality service.  Since we are a marketing company we order car plaques every month and the plaques are always perfect.  I always look forward to picking up our orders because of the fast, friendly service with Joy at the counter.< /text>

<Review>J & M Trophies was able to quickly make a plaque for an employee at my work. We put in a request at 5pm on Tuesday, and they were able to both find one that fit our budget -and- finish it by 9:30am on Thursday.
This was immensely helpful, and the prices were very realistic and doable. I will be using J & M Trophies in the future because of their fantastic service.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>I wanted to do something special for a coworker who was getting married. Some customized mugs with an inscription of the couple's names and wedding date seemed most memorable. I chose to go through J&M Trophies specifically because of my great interactions with Joy Barker. Once the mugs were finished, I found out there was some incorrect information (no fault of Joy's or J&M Trophies). I immediately contacted them and they were able to fix the gift in an extremely timely manner, so it was still a big success! Joy was very helpful and responsive through the process. Thank you Joy Barker and J&M Trophies! I will continue to recommend and use you for all my custom trophy or specialty inscription needs!<//text>< pics>

<review>I have been going to J & M Trophies since they were on Redlands Blvd.  A couple of years ago they got new owners however, the service is still wonderful.  The people in the shop are extremely helpful and friendly.  Their prices are comparable to other trophy shops.  The kids always love the trophies that I get from J & M.  I drive from Highland because they are worth it.  Thank you.</review>< Pics>

Needed a personalized name tag made within 4 buisness days for a last minute call for my uniform. After spending hours searching for a store who would only have it ready after 7 buisness days. My family and I found J and M. The extremely helpful owner, Joy, placed our order within a heartbeat and the name tag is expected to be done before needed.</Text>

With all the respect the owner is a ignorant lady I been getting a kids menudo and Birria For $5. Each equal to $10. But now the lady is saying the I need to get a regular one for $11. Put in mind the I'm getting two different plates menudo and birria so gotta take the other 1/2 of Birria home now 🤦 for what it is the same thing  as serving me a kids one but people are ignorant 🤷 she could be giving me less meat in a kids plate and on the end she get pay the same if anything she getting more money from me because they charge $1. Tax for plate but I guess Best spot with tortillas a mano good Birria and menudo the lady's the serve you are cool the take up to 30 to 1hr some time to get your food but is good food ...<//Text>

The goat birria is their main course meal. No other place can compare to the taste and quality.  Ever since a friend brought me here (may he R.I.P) I  still come back. You won't be dessapointed when you come and try it for yourself.</review>

Fantastic experience, from the ocean water crashing making relaxing vibes to the attentive staff (best in California!) They also have a limited but fantastic (so does limits really matter?) beer and wine selection. And the food itself was farm to table - everything we had was delicious. This is the type of food you eat and half way through you can’t wait to come back to eat there again. Yes. It’s that good. Trust me.<//Text>

<Review>Love the ambiance of this restaurant which is right up against the ocean with amazing views. Incredible and warm staff. Very thoughtful and curated menu with tons of organic healthy options all made with the best ingredients. This is one of my favorite eateries and I always make it a point to stop by when I'm in the area. There's a convenient paid parking lot ($15) that's close by making for a short walk to the restaurant.</Review>< Resp>

Our first dining experience at Malibu Farm Restaurant was absolutely wonderful; it did not disappoint. The ambience was spot on, the staff was super attentive and friendly, and the food - app, entree, and dessert - was incredible. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the dishes, and we also chatted with the General Manager, Mitch, who graciously took some time to check in with us. Overall, we loved the chill, positive vibe of the place. Pictured below is the Spaghetti Squash lasagna, which we both ordered, and it was super flavorful. Needless to say, we polished the plates off. And the ice cream, with a dollop of homemade cream at the top, holy cow... definitely save some room for that at the end. All in all, we can't wait to return. Please continue to support Malibu Farm!</text>

I admire this place! They serve high quality meals, their menu is varied, The chief cook in that place is a professional, I love very much trying all their dishes. The food is always tasty, the attitude towards the clients  is efficient. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend this place.< /review>

<Text>AMAZING VIEWS however the price of food and drink was not worth the lackluster meal. One small crab cake with no sides was over $20.< /Text>< pics>

<text>If you are looking for a delicious brunch in Malibu you need to look no further than Malibu Farm. The restaurant is right on the water at the Malibu pier and everything is fresh local and farm to table. The menu has many great options but I would definitely recommend the fried egg sandwich. The atmosphere is amazing and our service was great as well.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP76LuSEqUmna_bIANMfFngyiTP4ynaIEiqGkWF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO52YpYq78yyvzWlGw__r150n26Zb0DSvLwNkIS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80e81e2bb643dc6d:0xed89c4f9fbbb7061<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The ice-cream has some of the most interesting flavors I have ever seen.  I actually tried a bunch of them, but unfortunately none of them were to my liking.  In fact, as some googlers have mentioned previously, some of it just tastes like soap.  That said, the girl working behind the counter was very nice and patient with us, and the pumpkin ice-cream I finally decided on wasn't half bad.</review>

Really good food, service and views (it's not cheap, you're paying for that too). I recommend to try the Hearts of Palm Linguini  (I had it with the green sauce, it's both warm and fresh, and also filling for a veggie dish) and the Roasted Banana Ice Cream</Text>

Great place! It will more than likely be cold, next to the pacific...so bring a blanket or a jacket or they have blankets there. The view is great, food is great (get the blue chip nachos for an app). After this drive up a few miles to El Matador! Best views around.</review>

Really good healthy choices. The kale smoothie was amazing and so was the papaya cocktail.  We also had the fish tacos, which were excellent and the grilled veggie sandwich. The setting by the ocean and the views cant be beat.<//Review>

<review>Stopped here for lunch during a drive along Pacific Coast Highway. Such a beautiful view and the food was delicious.  A little pricey but worth the money. We ordered the lobster roll and the fish tacos. Both were great. The fresh watermelon juice was just what we wanted on a nice sunny day. Not too sweet, just right.</review><rate>5< /rate><resp>None< /resp></record>

Wow... let me say it again backwards wow! Very simple food but delicious. Fresh salad and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I sat outside and although it was about 50 degrees the setting and sights made me forget I was cold. Beautiful presentation of food with beautiful view.<//Text>

Nachos were nothing special and they gave me the wrong tortilla chip compared to what's on my receipt. Female waiter customer service was awful - lady yelled at people to stay 6ft apart etc. Can't they be nicer? It's Thanksgiving. Another ignored me. The cafe is great wouldn't waste my time on the restaurant though. Pretty tourist attraction though.< /review>

So good we visited 3 times during our visit to Malibu! I love finding gems like this in places I travel. It was a 2-3 min walking distance from our AirBnB. Went here for a sangria one afternoon and loved it so much we decided to come back for dinner AND for coffee the next morning. Servers were very pleasant and assisted us in surprising our friend for her bday. I highly recommend this place.</Review>

I don't know which was better, the ambiance, or the food! Everything from the from starters, to the main course, up to dessert were amazing. GREAT vegan courses as well! The cocktails are some of the best you'll find anywhere. I had a few... lol, enjoyed them all. The Coconut is highly recommended!<//text>

Beautiful outdoor setting overlooking the ocean. There is also inside seating as well. The food is all organic farm to table. Great drink menu and the best chocolate cake ever. It is hands down one of my favorite places to go to.< /Review>

< Review>
Everyone is talking about this restaurant in Malibu for their freshness and good food. I have seen a lot of Instagram pictures of this restaurant. Even the social media app from China has voted this restaurant as a hot internet sensation. Many internet influencers have raved about this restaurant too.

The scenery is spectacular with full view  of the beach from the pier. We saw many tourists from out of town who saw this restaurant on Instagram. We got a seat right in front of the beach with a beautiful view.

Unfortunately, with Covid-19, there is no more full table services. You had to order the food first and then find a seat to sit down. The server will bring the food out to you.

For the food, we were a bit disappointed. After reading about all the rave reviews, we had high expectations for the taste and flavors. Unfortunately, the cauliflower crust pizza was not too good. The chicken is so hard to chew and the crust was saggy. It's totally not worth $33 for a 6" pizza. My wife's order was not too good either, the Nachos was stale and the cheese was a bit hard. Maybe it's been waiting on the counter for awhile before it was taken out to us. The price tag of $22 is way over priced for a nacho. I think we should have try their pier Cafe instead.<//Review>

<review>Did a take out from this place during my visit to Malibu. Couple of vegan and vegetarian options. I particularly liked their vegan chop salad and green quesadillas. Good sized portions and great flavors. Their cauliflower pizza has a base of deep fried cauliflower with sauce and toppings. It is tasty but I do want to mention it is not a conventional pizza that has a baked base. Takeout process was smooth too and our food was ready in under 15 mins.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The restaurant is nice, the view is very good and the service was fast and attentive. However, the food was not amazing. We tried the steak sandwich and the salmon salad. I also ordered the chocolate shake. The steak sandwich was, for me, not tasty. The meat was dry and the bread was anything but especial. The shake was too sweet and the chocolate/cocoa flavor wasn’t that strong. We had a nice table outside, however, be prepared for a windy spot. It’s a bit pricey, but I guess that’s what you have to pay if you want eating with a view. We paid $50-ish each. Although it’s not a tourist trap, if what you are looking for is food, I would try another place. If you just want to chill and enjoy the pier, then eat here.

Ps: The code for the restrooms was 1980 by then.<//text>

This is the worst restaurant ever, the service, the food,  everything. And the check was with food that we never ordered, for 3 coffees and 3 horrible tacos, we had to pay 70 dollars, I had never seen a taco with only zucchini, it should be meet, but never saw the meet.< /Review>

Stopped by after a hike to relax and enjoy some of the amazing views! I had a glass of Chardonnay (very heavy pour ) and the oyster shot with lemon, agave, and tequila. It was definitely different from the typical tomato juice based shooters and I recommend giving it a try! We didn't order food but I flipped through the menu and there were a lot of things that looked great. Lots of healthy options and a few vegan/vegetarian options as well!

The night we went it was really chilly so it was easy to get a spot outside but I overheard the server say that it gets super packed when the weather warms up and there's always a long wait for a table.

The outdoor seating is wonderful and they have some spots with couches and comfy chairs. This is perfect for a date night or to bring visiting friends and family.< /Text>

Nice restaurant. The food is finally something different to all the fast food restaurants nearby. Nice waiters. And the location is outstanding. It is a bit pricey (15-25~  for a main dish), but that is what you can expect in Malibu. Would recommend and come back for sure.

Ps: Good location for a first date.<//Text>

This place is really cute and the food was really good! The wait was pretty long because they were transitioning to lunch and there was such a long line. The food was definitely good but definitely more expensive than other places.< /Text>

<Text>Divine location in the heart of Malibu. We ended our day on the patio side. (They have a nice looking indoor side as well - we wanted to be outdoors). Large deck/patio- well decorated and totally relaxing. Food was fine. Our waiter needed a personality and offered no help with menu. Drinks were fresh and yummy. Dinner and dessert was good. Casual place. Take a relaxing stroll to end of pier after dinner.< /Text>< Pics>

The outdoor setting here is beautiful. The menu is full of fresh and delicious options.

The current setup seems rather covid responsible. The tables are arranged to be distant from one another, the stead are all wearing masks, and the cleanliness seems to be on point. They are taking dinner orders from the shielded check in counter as well to keep direct contact with the staff to a minimum.

Overall this restaurant is delicious, and clean, it has great service and a beautiful atmosphere.< /Review>

This place had a really lovely atmosphere. It's right on the beach with gorgeous views of the ocean. If you're looking for a laid-back beachy vibe this is a good option, but beware the prices. Although the food was pretty good, I don't think it was worth the price. The lobster roll was $30... I know those are typically expensive sandwiches but I've had better quality for cheaper. You could skip the food and just get drinks or coffee and enjoy the space.</Review>

<Review>I can not say enough of how much I love coming here. The atmosphere won me over initially. Then the chocolate basil ice cream...love at first bite.  Then I came again,  a year later still craving this place and again still delicious. This last time my hubby and I split the spaghetti squash lasagna and the taco trio. I died and went to heaven over that lasagna and I am a lasagna snob in that I think mine is the best.
Coffee here is tasty, but not exceptional.  I am spoiled in that my hubby roasts coffee so I get good fresh coffee most of the time. One thing I do not get though is coffee art and these people know how to make coffee art. I was blown away.  There was a bear in my coffee. Yes, a bear.
They are expensive, but I will come again because I do not live here and it is a treat to come. You cannot beat the beautiful view, the atmosphere, the tasty unique food, the drink...just perfect for a nice relaxing time. I can just sit here being content and not want to leave. That does not happen very often for me.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBUm9XE-gKgSlVoXqAEFtsLYC-691WuxPMlYhb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyT6LHvkLEYBepuPNniT_yWlXRhDsP2y4zu4kV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtKLZgxG-9pq4ayxZOjnIN3zDW6BnIZ_6Aj8ut=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjrvsfYpXueCvWZ2O9XDtmI-7FNkYmOx7kqeSZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgae5aOy5QwHMhd3EmyUq6y8FCHxqr0zlKuUTQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuzcpWMopupk_qA93qQ6hDikIY-mKQRA6hbHvO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOei8yJXFoiEIt7xTkLdWXoxmoc-9L8FDvWDo28=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF7CZUR_o9-M0gRCLrhrIqsBYAVlkKY59iuOpW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmh0u0xudCGTikixZEKqkVzZBmld5dXNojRVWy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDFi_Pezrsgu-YeSi1XoRMcoPWGLv9iZctULwV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBa5yI4pLRfQfLTv80NPOAuAkH8MpE6Hu8Yg3Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy3YeIRxsQQWxCHxky-jJrhlUIIgKdUr71ExId=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFTmfC9yJ1EaAP9KHDL-D-Ugr1ezIfe8fkjKMA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa0coiNKlxeqaM4pM9aOy82tdJjE_ImBqBqNSl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhPJYaNPx2gpEpD2xFChNIGxKszfikyPLQQJv8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvScctk5ysw9vWG17HwIndbT8DzLwbC1ayRE0j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUcyQk4063dxCrZPLOY11bjepXUnJomcarIrDI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw0v-1mguQ0OxNzUWyqIFLz6yBUHYKT7En_Bab=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Minus the waiting part (20-30 mins) to be seated, we were greeted with smiling faces and an overall great service. The food was fantastic. I had the pleasure of eating squash lasagna and it was definitly an experience (I recommend adding chicken either sausage or chicken breast). The prices are a bit on the higher end, but considering the taste, it was well worth it.< /Review><rating>5</rating><response>None< /response></record>

I always love coming here. The food is amazing, views can't be beat. You won't even mind waiting for the table. It's pretty out on the pier too and the food and drinks and seating is nice out there to. This is a must every time we come to Los Angeles area! We make the drive out!! Their saffron ice cream is good! Lots of gluten free options.<//text>

Came here for lunch and got a table on the outside patio. There was a line, but it moved fast. Got the salmon burger. The menu seems to be around 'healthy' food, so the burger did not come with fries, but a side of potatoes in a warm creamy sauce, some salad leaves (could have been served seasoned rather than plain) and a rice salad. The outside patio faces the sea and is covered overhead with some lights. Would be a great setting for dinner too.</Text>

<review>Amazing service everyone that was very friendly on the food was very good. I got the cauliflower pizza.  The only downside was the heater outside wasn't working so we are pretty cold but they gave us blankets!  We also got the grilled chocolate cake which in my opinion was good but could be more grilled.</review></record>

<Text>Late post*
My friends came from Germany, I live in OC and we like this trendy place, good quality food, great ambiance that makes you enjoy the time you are spending there.
I give 3 stars because service was poor and rude, we had different servers and none of they were nice, it seems they take for granted having costumers.
Me and my friends requested from the beginning to have separate checks, the first server said that is okay, then the last server which never introduce herself got upset about separating the bill and just told us with an attitude that the policy of the restaurant is maximum 3 different cards.
I  hope that if the manager gets to read this post and take my suggestion to improve staff training to be courteous and professional, as a costumer I need the service as much the employees needs from our consume.</Text>< Pics>

The restaurant is a nice view to Malibu beach. The outside seating is pleasant. The food overall are okay, and the serving portion are full filling. The ice cream Cherry coconut cashew with cake on top is delicious, just weird how come arugula in that.</Review>

Great atmosphere. Beautiful decor. Great location.

To be seated all parties must be present for brunch. And there’s no reservations for brunch, first come first serve. If you’re waiting for the party, get seated and enjoy a drink and / or appetizer. Once they arrive, cash out and join them in line.

If there’s an option, sit outside, the decor and view is pretty!</text>

We had a waterfront view at the restaurant (not the cafe on the pier.) Although there was a lie, wait time was quick. We were seated within 20 mins. The Bloody Mary drink was beautifully garnished. We enjoyed: the Malibu blue nachos, blt kale caesar and fish tacos. The fish tacos were amazing: fresh with a variety of "make it yourself" ingredients (see photo). I highly recommend this place, situated in the heart of Eastern Malibu.<//text>

<review>What a beautiful place it is. They have great seatings with view. We had to change tables 3 times just to get the table with view and the staffs seemed very flexible with that. Great service, with great food.
Chris served us and he was amazing.
We had a chicken sandwich and a beef burger and 2 red wines. Oh what a taste food it was. Me and my fren were thrilled with the food and drink.
One of the best burger and sandwich... its so hard to get the beef right and they did a fantastic job with it!!!

Apart from food, I loved their designs on all 3 different sites within Malibu cafe with exceptionally beautiful view.</review>< date>

I got the beet salad with fresh watermelon juice. The salad had just a few ingredients with a very light dressing which I thought was very good and good for you. The atmosphere is cool and the view is amazing. The frosé is to die for!</review>

I took a Peach Smoothie and it was so delicious, I recommend it 🍑 🍹 ❤️ !!!!

What we ordered was delicious and felt honestly fresh thoughtfully prepared. The location is second to none, loads of seating options scattered around the pier for Sue we'll be back to explore. Overall could not be more positive, would give 6 stars if I could. Parking is available across the street ($15 all day).< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCBVLPM2QaulV7EpxlTCSS3G8ZYd0gabXg7MvM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

Food okay, but not stellar.
Ordering food is beyond clunky, needs to be updated to what others are doing.
Need to do something about excessive parking charge.
Again, great view...< /Review>< user_name>

Rustic atmosphere. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. Food gets cold fast if there when weather is cold. Order to table was really quick. Had Sunday Brunch and was delicious. Downside was a few flies due to open air dining. There was a slight damp musty odor.<//Text>

Love the new, larger restaurant, bar and veranda at foot of Venice Pier...original cafe at end of pier is still a charming spot for breakfast & coffee. Organic, farm-to-pier menu is delicious. Many vegan and vegetarian options, salads, plus home churn ice creams. Chocolate sunday is worth every calorie you might have burned off running on the beach.< /Review>

Beautiful place at malibu Pier. Ask for a table outside even if there is wait, it worth it. I have a kale cesar salad and it was fine... next time i will order the burger< /Text>

Can't go wrong with any of the food here, great staff, awesome service and the views (especially around sunset) are AMAZING! I got the Taco trio and a glass (maybe a few) of their house red wine and both were absolutely phenomenal. Highly recommend this place if you're in Malibu.</review><rating>5</rating><gmapID>0x80e81e2bb643dc6d:0xed89c4f9fbbb7061< /gmapID><username>Trevor Abbott<//username><user_id>109511814176781882961< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

The place was nice. A bit pricey for me though. The tacos & lobster roll + house wine is $72.  Check the photos.<//review>

<text>This place is cute! The drink menu is well curated and the pier is far less congested than others in the area.
For fast casual, walk to the end of the pier.
For table service, find the hostess stand on your right when you walk in.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>Aesthetically pleasing and a lovely place to walk with family. The food and drinks are par for the course and the wait staff are adequately friendly and attentive. A great place to visit if you aren't necessarily looking for a great meal.</review>< pics>

Most amazing place for breakfast. Been here every single time in Los Angeles. The orange juice is to die for so is the coffee. However the coconut baked French toast is like heaven on earth. This has to be the best dish on the menu. Come early as it can get busy on weekends. We've been here usually before 10:30 am as parking can also be a problem. Tip: bring cash as parking is cash only. Really lame but Malibu Farm has no control over this.</review>

Things that I look for in a restaurant: great food and a great vibe. This place has both. And the location is incredible being right on the coast. I’d recommend it to anyone vacationing in LA.</Text>

<Text>Awesome meal with an even better venue. They have 3 locations in the pier with the shop on the end of the pier closed in the evening. There is a more formal restaurant on one side and a casual courtyard and bar on the other. We ate in the outside courtyard where there are heaters to keep you warm as it cools off. Something for everyone but a little surprising of the limited seafood on the menu. Everything is fresh with lots of vegetarian options. Great desserts and cocktails too!<//Text>< gmap_id>

The wait was not bad, about 5 minutes at 11 am on a Saturday. The heat and lack of shade was a different issue, more canopy would not be wasted. The coffee was not all that great, the beans seemed like they were old, but a little bit of cream solved the problem. The pumpkin pancakes were good (they had bacon on top ... who doesn't like that?), but the butternut squash was not a useful addition. The egg sandwich was very good, even though the ratio of bun to everything else was a bit too big. Overall, we paid more than the food was worth, but the view made up the difference.< /text>

This place is great for special occasions. The outdoor seating with good weather is one of the best in Southern California. The food and service we're good too. The meal was very expensive, you pay for the location.<//Review>

Great place to go to for a nice view and breeze.  Very chill atmosphere.  Waitress was awesome and the food/drinks came out at a decent pace.  The food itself was delicious and drinks were well made.  Good place to go to if you're not seeking to pay a lot for a meal from the nearby Nobu< /review>

The food is fantastic, the cocktails are spot-on and the service is top-notch! Seriously excellent location for "date nights". Get there early to walk the pier and check out the beach.< /text>

Make sure you make a reservation. Bees and flies love the live indoor plants. Food and staff are good, ambiance was a little tough to take in. Out side lounge is romantic, indoor area is not.< /Text>

If you're willing to stand and wait for the line that is almost always guaranteed to be snaking out the front door than this quaint Malibu restaurant is worth it. With two locations, one at the beginning and end of the pier, the quality of the food offered is top-notch...and the prices match accordingly. Enjoy the good vibes and overpriced cocktails and feel free to brag to your friends about where you enjoyed brunch as they'll definitely be jealous!< /text>

<text>Outstanding, really enjoyed it. Our waitress was great, friendly and very accommodating. The location is so nice, you can eat inside or on the pier overlooking the ocean.
All of our meals were great, lemon chicken, skirt steak and their salad  were cooked just right and very flavorful.

This is my daughter's favorite restaurant, she recommended it and it delivered.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

Food was excellent. Service was so so. While the staff were reasonably friendly, they were very busy and gave us minimal service. This is a very popular restaurant in a great location. We went before 7 pm and there was just two of us so we were seated right away. Larger groups had a much longer wait.</Review>

Best place to take your date to. Lovely place with ocean view. We started with their signature nachos. It’s was delicious. Then we had pizza and squash spaghetti. We really loved the place and the food. I would love to visit it again especially during the sunset time.<//review>

Stop light tacos were amazing. Also, I ordered the large fish taco platter. The platter was great-tasting but it's more of a meal for just one person, instead of the suggested 2. Portions are small here, so be prepared to order something extra.</review>

This place pops up first when searching for brunch and breakfast spots in Malibu, but they weren't even serving breakfast when we arrived at 11 on Sunday. Total bust and $20 parking.. Malibu you can do better.<//review>

< Review>
My chicken was excellent. My wife's vegan pasta meal was bland. Cocktails where good. Why only 2 stars you ask. Hostess kept seating people out of order. No water glasses, just a bottle. No plates with appitizer. We saw other tables with these things. Most of all a dirty used tooth pick stuck in a groove of our table and when  we pointed it out the server just sort of shrugged. Maybe we didn't look wealthy enough.<//Review>

Once we got our food she informed us that she was going on break.  Another waiter came over to pour more wine into our glasses.  I asked him if we could take the rest of the bottle with us.  He said no.  I replied “well that’s a problem.”  He then became very rude. He threw a dessert menu on our table saying “just in case you want something for the future.”  We witnessed this same waiter explaining in detail to the table next to us.  We had to ask for our check.  Once paid he took our receipt and said nothing.  Not thank you or have a nice night.  Nothing!  Just to add to our experience the group seated next to us had their French Bulldog whetting a cone inside the dining room.
Food was mediocre.  Service was terrible!  I feel so upset by our treatment.  I would never recommend this restaurant.< /Review>< time>

This place is great! We sat outside without much of a wait. The view was brilliant (360 photo), I recommend sitting outside, but I believe it is walk up only so there may be a wait. We shared a few plates & drinks. Aside from the Rose Sangria pitcher being terrible & instead of trying to get us something we enjoyed we paid the $35 for the pitcher & ordered another around at $15 each. Otherwise, we enjoyed everything. The crab cakes are incredible and the nachos are definitely something to try.</review>

Wife got take-out tacos while we enjoyed the beach. THREE CHICKEN TACOS FOR TWENTY SIX DOLLARS? I don't care how exclusive your location is. You can't charge $26 for three soggy tacos. You just can't. That's not how tacos work.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Heard it was good, and it didn't disappoint!  I was with some picky eaters, and they all found good things on the menu that fit their eating requirements.   I got the squash gluten free lasagna and I was literally blown away.  The hosts were awsome, the server was fun and attentive, great ocean views, therefore this place gets my highest recommendation.  The only down side, and it isn't there fault, and that is it is in a super congested part of Malibu, so it might be hard to find parking if you want to say come a busy weekend or something.< /text>< Pictures>

For such an expensive place you would think the food would have more flavor... It was unfortunate that everything we ordered was bland and NOT to die for since the atmosphere is so beautiful! I wouldn't eat here again.< /Review>

Amazing cocktails. A great view and really friendly service people. The food is expensive but well worth it. Both the bar and the restaurant were enjoyable to eat and drink in. We were stuck in Malibu for a few hours but this was a good place to be stuck without a doubt.</review>

They have this amazing squash spaghetti I think that's what it's called the server will know what you're talking about it is heaven oh my gosh! Full of flavor yass!! I didn't order any drinks but my cousin said the drinks we're good they didn't shy away on the pour which is great as if you're paying a high price for a drink you want to lease have a good pour. Only disadvantage well not really they're really popular so expect a wait.<//Review>< pics>

We were actually going to Nobu ( a few blocks away) but they had nothing available without reservations. So we walked a few blocks to the pier and found this place. When we got there the hosts were a little disorganized and different people were saying the same thing ( there is room for 2 inside, or for 4 outside without shade..). Finally we sat outside in the shade which was nice. We ordered crabs as appetizer (3 pieces very small dish), then 3 salads and a fish taco. The salads were big, tasted fresh and presentation was good. The fish taco was amazing; the fish was fresh and delicious and you could choose to add the potatoes, salad and make it your own way. The atmosphere was nice, casual with families and tourists. And the smoothies! The smoothies were amazing! We ordered 2 peach smoothies and they were better than any Jamba Juice or big smoothie chain store.. I would recommend it to anyone visiting!< /text>

Super sweet location and awesome fresh and creative food. We were here for Sunday brunch around 10, got seated right away, outside. Friendly and relaxed staff and atmosphere! Drip coffee was a bit bitter for me, but the green eggs and ham and the corn pancakes (basically corn bread in a pancake) were the bomb! 😋</review>

<text>Good food, location, and friendly service. 3 stars instead of 5 because of a few things. Some of our utensils and plates came out not well-cleaned so we had to ask for new settings. Also, the prices were a bit steep. A standard meal for 2, we spent $150. Celebrating getting married just the day before, we hoped for something sweet and complimentary, but nah. No biggie on this last one, but definitely appreciate a restaurant that knows how to provide a special experience for their customers, especially considering they have such a romantic and mood-setting location.</text>< pics>

The view is incredible, especially if you're to the right. They put a plexiglass barrier but you see a great perspective to the end of the pier and down to the beach. My opinion is that it is a very "LA" place and it's great four tourists. There are beautiful hikes close by and Zuma Beach is very close too.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Rating>4< /Rating></record>

Frosè was really good, but not sure I could say that it was 100% worth the long line or average price per entree. I also was talked into something besides my original order from our server and ended up regretting it, kind of a coin flip there.

Still 4 stars for pretty view and cute decor, just maybe a tiny bit over hyped</review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>We had an excellent and delicious brunch at Malibu Farms this past Sunday. Being on the pier along the ocean makes the atmosphere wonderful, and I'm assuming on a sunny day sitting outside would be great (it was misting a bit so sitting outside wasn't an option). We only waited about 10 minutes for a table for two, and service was efficient and attentive. I got the fried egg sandwich and a mocha, both of which were delicious - I'd easily get it again when we go back. Prices were about what'd you expect from a boutique brunch spot in LA (~$15+ for entree, ~$6 for espresso drinks). I would highly recommend coming here for brunch!< /Review>< user_name>

Decent price for drinks in the area. Open and right by the water so the atmosphere was nice. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink, the bartender seemed like she had better things to do and the drinks were just alright so we didn't order more than the one. I would go back if in the area again and try some food probably.< /Review>

<review>Good food in a beautiful location. However, the service was terrible. 2 members of our party of 6 got their food 10 minutes before everyone else. Our server never checked up on us during the meal and was rude and sarcastic in our limited interaction with him.

I highly doubt that I’ll be back.</review><time>1534625895743<//time><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

There are two Malibu Farms. This is the one at the start of the pier. Healthy brunch place with beautiful views and vibes. It's very scene-y if you like that.<//review>

<text>Wow, didn't expect the quality to be so high and the dishes to be so flavorful. Interestingly enough, a lot of the dishes are plays on specific styles or traditional recipes so they can be surprising. The Smoke cocktail was the way to go and the service was efficient and kind.</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Wasn't a huge fan of the prices, buuuut, it's Malibu and the view is amazing so it shouldn't come at a surprise that this place is pricey.

I came on a Sunday around 10:30AM and there were plenty of seating at their patio (everyone in the group must be here to be seated). The view was stunning and loved the decor of their outdoor seating. It was a tad bit chilly though (dress appropriately to stay warm as there weren't any heat lamps that I know of).

We ordered a few things ranging from their salsa verde egg-wich, tofu spinach tomato scramble (vegan option), vanilla lattes, oj and a bloody mary. I am very hesitant with vegan food usually because I always fear them to be on the bland side, but I was quite blown away with how tasty their tofu scramble was. The use of the butternut squash gave the whole dish this amazing earthy and aromatic but delicious taste to the dish. The pairing of some baby potatoes (lightly salted) gave it the perfect amount of savoriness. I loved the dish. :) Their oj also tasted very refreshing (they said it's freshly squeezed with organic oranges). Everyone else in the group had a great time with their food and dine-in experience. Would definitely try and come back on a warmer day!< /Review>

Very attentive.   Hostess seemed bored and was not super welcoming.   Waitress was nice.   Will return but wasn't wowed.<//text>< pictures>

The food is good, not too many gluten free options. Service is not that great, but the view and the quality of the food partially makes up for it. Very crowded on weekends.</text>

<Text>A must-visit for breakfast when we're in L.A. The menu is local and organic, but the best part is the idyllic setting on the Malibu Pier--there are sweeping views of the ocean and coastline.<//Text>< Name>

<text>The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL! Wonderful aesthetics and very photogenic. We sat outside in our own little corner, prob my fav seats here!

Positives:
• It's Beautiful
• The food was good (we came with 7 girls and we all enjoyed the food, aside from the coffee which was just okay)
• The sunset view was spectacular

Negatives:
• Our waiter was terrible.. Did not make an effort at alllll. We all were smiling and being nice and the whole time she looked angry .. For an expensive restaurant like this I was embarrassed to bring my Team.
• There were 4 spiders dangling above our heads, pretty big ones too
• A bit overpriced</text>< Pictures>

<review>It's no surprise that the seafood was amazingly fresh (I had the Salmon "plate") and it was accompanied with equally as fresh vegetables. The restaurant itself was very clean and has a beautifully decorated open space that offers an intimate view of the ocean.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Easily one of my all-time favorite restaurants. Frosé! The poke appetizer with the taro chips is delectable. I love the sweet finish of the taro crisp and the rich buttery tuna bite. It's unctious! Especially if you get a glimmer of wasabi and avocado in the bite! Mmmmm! The steak here is a definite must-try!< /text>

Same owner two restaurants. One serving excellent food and hot tea with good service and this one weird earl gray tea with lavender. They don't even tell you it's with lavender until you order earl gray tea as it says on menu and you are liable to pay for it . The food is ok but not nearly as good as the end of pier. And the customer service is another story. They attitude is take it or leave it. We tried four times same story every time. I'm done with this one. Stick with the end of pier.</review>

< review>
Below average food...
Too expansive for what it is...
We had a nacho that wasnt good.
The salad and the pizza weren't good either.
Coffee was ok.
Service was good.
Seating was good.
To sum up... 132$ for a below average 2 persons dinner is terrible</review>

a solid meh. the space is delightful, the location is great. service is inattentive. food is fine, but priced at a higher quality than provided. you are paying for the view.</Text>

The place is located at the beginning of the Malibu peer which is a really gorgeous location.

However, the food is disappointing and the prices a bit high.<//Text>

<text>Went for brunch on a Saturday, inside, on the restaurant side. The food is great, limited, but great. It's very Malibu (read: a bit bougie), but it's really good. The service was slow which was a bit annoying. The price is fine, but $8+ for a latte is a bit ridiculous. Heh. It's a great vibe inside, very Malibu. I'd be curious about the bar side, but there are other places I'd rather go again for brunch. But if someone suggested it, I wouldn't say no. I might even go again for the bar. It'd be a cute date idea, actually. It's worth a visit if you need a healthy, organic, GF brunch place on the pier. Oh, yeah, it's on the pier and that's GREAT. It's nice!</text>< rating>

< Review>
Appetizers are pre made and seemed like main course too it felt like they had a gun to our heads to get out within 30 mins.  Main course came out within five mins of the pre made Appetizers and a lot of the food was cold like the "steamed" broccoli. I don't write a lot of reviews but coming all the way from New York for such a fast food experience was really disappointing especially when you have an image of a farm to table laid back experience.

Sad.< /Review>

20 bucks for a school cafeteria cup of saffron ice cream (tasted like peach) and a 12 oz coffee. Then told the tables are for customers with food. Out of all 20 tables and 6 couches, 4 tables used. Thanks jerks. You can keep your ice cream and snotty-ness. So long not coming back here.< /review>

Great place to come for the view, can see the pier and the Malibu coast on the left. It gets pretty chilly amd windy here in late December so keep that in mind if you come.

There is a deck area thats has sofas and a direct view. There are glass wind shields so it makes it slightly wamer than rest of the outdoors sitting area. We originally sat in the non-deck area - the staff was very accomodating when we asked them to move us ahead.

The servers were fast and attentive. I had the Grass-fed beef burger and it was juicy, tender and very filling aside from looking great. The bottom of the bun was crispy and the cheese tasted great. Stayed for coffee later. Just a slight but on the expensive side overall - especially the coffee.

The latte came cold once - we asked for it again and they brought it perfect and removed it off our cheque for the mistake. Great service!<//Review>

<review>The Hostess had my family and I wait for over 30 mins when we walked inside the restaurant  it was empty, when I asked her why the wait she said she "thght we wanted an outside table".  Um Maybe you shold ask sweety?! The sever Landon was not helpful, the food took over 40 mins when asked Landon stated you can't rush the chicken. Um really? I will not come here again. The food was basic and overpriced for a brussel sprouts salad. It was my sis 30th bday and all my family flew in. Do not waate time or money. And I'm out!</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80e81e2bb643dc6d:0xed89c4f9fbbb7061<//Gmap_id></record>

Been dining here for a long time. Service, food and view is always good. A bit on the pricy side for the servings but the view and area is what you pay for. Parking limited and it’ll cost you.</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Healthy restaurant on the Malibu pier where you can also eat vegan. Lunch inside the very cozy restaurant furnished in Californian style. Special dishes cooked and presented well, excellent raw materials. Young and very kind staff. High prices, but we are in Malibu. Recommended!

Ristorante healthy sul Malibu pier dove è possibile mangiare anche vegano. Pranzo all’interno del locale molto accogliente arredato in stile californiano. Piatti particolari cucinati e presentati bene, materie prime eccellenti. Personale giovane e gentilissimo. Prezzi alti, ma siamo a Malibu. Consigliato!</Review><UserId.>110245886965939967622<//UserId.><time>1582025422115</time><username>Anna<//username>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I heard that famous celebrities like it. I am a stranger and I am not satisfied with the price. It was difficult to satisfy both quantity and taste at a reasonable restaurant dinner price. We did not have a car park, so we parked at a nearby parking lot ($ 5 for 30 minutes) and paid an additional $ 10.

유명 연예인이 좋아한다고 들었습니다만. 저는 모르는 사람이고 가격대비 만족도가 떨어집니다. 왠만한 레스토랑 디너 가격에 양, 맛 모두 만족하기 어려웠습니다. 게다가 주차장도 없어 근처 유료주차장(30분 5달러)에 주차하여 10달러를 추가로 지불하였습니다.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Malibu Farm Restaurant on Malibu Beach

Going to Malibu Beach or Venice Beach
A friend of mine chooses Malibu Beach as a recommendation of this restaurant.
In conclusion, I peeked a little bit at both beaches.
The colors of both were so different and my style is calm and quiet Malibu Beach.

I was worried about what to eat here and ordered two pizzas and a lobster roll. The pizza was a fresh and healthy style with a salad on top of potatoes, and the lobster rolls were good in texture and taste. Overall satisfied :-)
After dinner we went to Malibu beach cafe and dumped it but when we went we were just closed (about 3: 00-4: 00 pm on Sunday)?

✅ cauli flower crust "pizza" --- 18
+ mozzarella, tomato, pesto

✅ lobster louie roll ------ 30
+ avocado, boiled egg, lemon aioli

-----------
✅ Total 48

말리부 해변에 있는 'Malibu Farm Restaurant'

말리부 비치를 갈까, 베니스 비치를 갈까 고민하다가
친구의 지인이 이 식당의 뷰를 더 추천해서 말리부 비치로 선택.
결론적으로 두 비치 모두 살짝씩 엿봤다.
둘의 색이 너무 달랐고 내 스타일은 조용조용한 말리부 비치.

이곳에서 뭐먹을지 고민하다가 피자와 랍스터롤 두가지를 주문했다. 피자는 감자전 위에 샐러드가 올라간 맛으로 굉장히 신선 건강한 스타일이었고, 랍스터롤은 식감도 맛도 괜찮았다. 전반적으로 만족:-)
식사이후에 말리부 비치 카페를 가고팠으나 우리가 갔을때는 막 영업 종료한 상태였다😭😭 (일요일 오후 3시반-4시 즈음?)

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>(Translated by Google) What should I write. JUST AWESOME!! One of the best places I have ever eaten. The flair right on the Pacific is the madness. The food and drinks were delicious. To sit comfortably one of the best places around L.A.
The farm is one of the top 10 restaurants in Los Angeles and it has confirmed that. Staff attentive and very professional.
Here you can really stay for hours and look at the sea.
The farm is located directly on the Pacific Coast highway in Malibu. Parking is rather difficult as many townies come here to swim and surf after work. If you have $ 10 left to park, you should do it right next to the restaurant.

(Original)
Was soll ich schreiben. EINFACH HAMMER!! Eine der besten Locations wo ich je gegessen habe. Das Flair direkt am Pazifik ist der Wahnsinn. Das Essen und die Getränke waren super lecker. Zum gemütlichen Sitzen einer der besten Plätze rund um L.A.
Die Farm gehört zu den Top 10 Restaurants in Los Angeles und das hat es auch bestätigt. Personal aufmerksam und sehr professionell.
Hier kann man wirklich stundenlang verweilen und auf das Meer blicken.
Die Farm ist direkt am Pacific Coast highway in Malibu gelegen. Parken wird eher schwierig, da viele Townies zum Schwimmen und Surfen nach Feierabend hierherkommen. Wer 10 Dollar für das Parken übrig hat, sollte das auch direkt neben dem Restaurant machen.< /Review>< Time>

(Translated by Google) Nice place, quite busy so you have to wait to get a table, organic food, there are vegetarian options I think vegan.
We tried the chicken, salmon, spaghetti, salad and sandwich, everything tasted nice, the staff was attentive and helpful.

The bathrooms are 2, they are shared and as the site is busy, you may have to wait a long time to use it.

<text>(Translated by Google) Terrace very nice. Price quite high for the quantities proposed. But nice staff. I particularly recommend for the terrace and the view. Good selection of wines.

We got a table with an amazing view !!! You can see the sea and the pier. Organic food very very rich! We have delicious lemonade with mint, coffee with milk and scrambled eggs, etc. Also very good attention. We were family and we had a great time. Once you finish, they rush you with the account because they have many clients waiting. I recommend it !! It was a magical moment !!!
