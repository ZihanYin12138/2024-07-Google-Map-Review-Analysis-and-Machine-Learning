< Review>
The front office lady was very professional and courteous. She was very helpful and made the storage process smooth! Definitely recommend!

For anyone wondering, pricing is average but worth it since the first month is free (but in case you didn’t know, there’s an admission fee/insurance you need to get [of your choice]) .

Hope this is helpful for anyone unsure.<//Review>

I am so pleased with the service at this facility. Shauna and Samantha have been such a pleasure to do business with, they’re always cheerful and great at their jobs. They helped me with getting a new unit set up across country, and made sure I had everything I needed.  I would definitely recommend this location, besides the wonderful employees, the units were clean and easily accessible.</Text>

Going from a household  to two separate locations as well as a storage  is by any means not an easy feat ..The staff here at extra space has been very accommodating  making this alot easier than previous experiences. Someone who is also in the field I must say it is nice to see individuals  as informative  and helpful as the staff here ag extra space. Very spacious and accommodating for moving trucks and entry.< /Text>

< review>
Was in recently to inquire about units for our upcoming move. Amber was very helpful and friendly. The place is very clean and seems secure. I have stored at other facilities and none of them have come close to how clean this place is. This is important because you just never know. Amber knew her stuff and helped me determine what size unit I will need. She was great! I wish I had known about this place when I first lived here 3 years ago. Highly recommend!!<//review>

<review>I really don’t know where to begin to describe the customer service I received this morning, I got more than I ever expected from any business. Samantha is wholeheartedly a genuine and caring person. I left the facility feeling relieved with heartfelt sobs. The transition that I was going through starting to fall into place and the entire process of wanting a storage unit and renting one out made my situation effortless. Thank you, Samantha!<//review>< pics>

All I can say is WOW! What customer service! Best storage place to ever rent from. Samantha went above and beyond to make me feel welcomed and  comfortable storing my things. Very kind. The thing that sets her apart, is she’s very professional, but also, PERSONABLE! That makes a difference. Amber was also very helpful and understanding to my specific needs, with the items I would be storing. Definitely a 5 star place all the way. If you’re reading this, and have hestitation on choosing a facility, like I did, trust me when I say, this place is safe, secured,  clean and very well maintained!</review>

<Text>I made a risk-free reservation online and when I arrived to secure my unit, I was greeted by Amber who was very friendly and professional. I had many questions and she was extremely patient and knowledgeable. As she took me on a tour of the site, I was quite impressed by how clean the property was kept as well as how quiet and secure it was. All in all it was an excellent experience and I will highly recommend this storage facility to my family and friends.</Text>< Pictures>

Samantha helped me out. During what could have been a very stressful time in my life, she made me feel at ease with getting my storage. I would highly recommend this facility. I would give 10 stars if I could. The process is quick and easy.< /Review>

<Review>This Extra Space Storage is a very nice facility that is centrally located in town, right off Highway 99, and close to downtown. There are cameras recording on the cloud 24/7, alarms on each unit, and manager lives on site. Facility is well kept up and Manager and her assistant are very friendly, accommodating, and understanding to help meet all your storage needs and help you have the best storage experience. There are huge to small sizes and there are drive up outside units or indoor units with climate control. I am a very devoted extra space customer and very glad to be a tenant here.<//Review>< Pictures>

When I visited Extra Space, I immediately felt at ease and knew I would get the information I needed.
Candice and Sam were extremely helpful in answering all of my questions with no problem.
They were polite and very friendly, I would recommend this location to anyone.

Thank you Candice and Sam</text>

< Review>
This place is awesome!! It’s close to the Freeway if you don’t live close. The Manager lives onsite, so somebody is always there😊 They have 24 hour video monitoring and the units are within a security gate. I’ve had a previous unit through this Company before and ran into one of the employees (Samantha) at this location. She is a sweetheart and made me feel even more secure, she is a great employee that makes you feel like more than a customer😊 She knows how to talk to people and makes me feel very welcome when I’m there.. More like a friend, lol, even though I’ve never hung out with her... Extra Space, you have an awesome employee on your hands. Take care of those girls, they take care of us❤️<//Review>

They have SO many boxes. I bought a few extra so I can camp in the backyard after my wife notices I threw out the box of creepy dolls she had. Friendly, understanding, balding Latino gentleman recommended the extras; Good thinking, José!</Review>

Being a younger person they had faith in me and gave me a wonderful place to keep all of my gear for awhile. I would recommend these people if you ever have any storage needs. I have seen two managers and four or five other workers come through here and I have never had a bad time with any of them. Extra space if I ever need it, youll be the only ones ill ever come back to!

Although I was appreciative of the free month. Took our first load 8:30 p.m. last night 6-4-2018 we were told gates closed at 10:00 called the call center said someone would be by to open the gate waited past 9:30 No one called and no one came. I'm frustrated because I had to pay ppl to help me move. Had to bring the stuff back and unload only because someone didnt give us the right information. I'm disabled I have to pay ppl to help me!!!!. Not ok!!!! Clearly they are not organized!!!!! I'm Not a happy customer< /Text>

This place has the worst customer service.   Our interior storage unit was broken into, (the padlock was cut) and several items were stolen.   The staff didn't seem to care and did nothing to provide ANY information on how to proceed.   I've contacted the manager on several occasions who says "he's looking into it" - but I have to keep calling him back!    I realized that they don't really provide much security despite their "cameras" - so I've removed everything from our space and terminated our contract.   Why bother to have a locked gate (which is frequently wide open on weekends) and camera surveillance (staff must sleep at the desk and never watch) if the company doesn't even stand by the service it's supposed to be offering???   Store stuff here if you don't really have anything to lose.  Also, use a very strong padlock (not one of the ones they sell in their office - which I did).   What a mistake using them.< /text>

< Review>
As I am writing this review my mouth is watering thinking of the Pizzas, Philly cheese steak and the garlic cheese breads I have had at Captain Tony's with my friends!!

There are so many good parts about getting your next meal and future catering meals etc from here.

A) The food is frikkin slamming!
B) The owner and employees were present with me and my friends GIVEN they were working large orders.
C) I LOVE MOTORCYCLES! And the owner's son Drake is a 7 year old flat track racer and this supports his career. It's rad man, there is a helmet at the counter and pictures of other young riders who they support and are fans of! 10 points 💪🏽
D) Did I tell you the food is slamming?

I can easily see myself and my crew stopping by Captain Tony's to meet Ken the owner and grabbing dinners after our track days at Willow springs. Thank you Ken and team for keeping many bellies happy!!< /Review>

<text>Ordered through Uber eats (I usually get my captain tonys fix on Ave J) Cheese was melted which was mind blowing I know they don't shred their Mozzarella because it wasn't melted! Totally disappointed in the quality. I have been a loyal captain Tonys for several years this is the first eating at this one on 45th. I will not got back to this location again< /text><name>king grant</name><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

Captain Tony's has had me hooked since the first time I ordered from there. Their food has consistently been awesome and everyone always gives great customer service! My wife and I love their pizzas and their philly cheese steaks! They're great!< /Text>

Great place! The pizza is good, the people are nice and friendly, and they help out the community. Reminds me of small town America back in the 90s.</Text>

Such a great pizza place! Pretty much the only legitimate place to get decent pizza. Any chance I get I go to Captain Tony's over the other pizza restaurants.< /Text>

<text>Ken is the awesomest, very helpful, with patience that I cannot describe. With customer service like this and food tasting this bomb I'm definitely going to come here more often.
The whole family was satisfied no complaints, I just can't begin to explain how it is ordering from this place, just need to experience it yourself... :)</text>< username>

<Review>Shady business with shady people.  I ordered food for my family and it never showed up, yet my card was still charged.  When I finally spoke to a manager he was unhelpful and condescending. Still haven't been refunded.  Please take your business anywhere else!!!!<//Review>< user>

<Text>I use to get pizza from here all the time back in high school. I ordered from here lastnight and it took an hour and a half just for a large cheese pizza. Only reason I'm not giving a 1 star, is because of the sweet man who delivered the pizza. Not ordering from here again!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c25c9cc71ca141:0x67bf2dba4ba269af<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I took our daughter for a photo shoot session with Guy Viau this weekend and he was very friendly, welcoming, and professional! We had a wonderful time throughout the photo shoot and my daughter loved the entire experience! The headshots turned out absolutely beautiful and my daughter couldn’t have been happier with the outcome! We are all very pleased with his beautiful work and professionalism!! Guy is an outstanding photographer!<//review>

I needed to get professional headshots for acting, and my sister recommended Guy. My overall experience was absolutely amazing! He was so fun to work with, and it was easy to follow his direction because he is so kind and generous. When I saw the photos I squealed with excitement because they were so beautiful, professional and creative. Guy has incredible vision and you can trust that your photos will be the best ever taken. I'd recommend Guy Viau Photography for all your photography needs because he is excellent at what he does.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Guy is the incredible: professional, talented, fast and with good prices. My daughter had her headshots done with him. She was very nervous at the beginning and Guy was able to make her feel comfortable to get the best shots. Amazing! Also, that day the strong wind made the session difficult, almost impossible, but Guy's experience, skills and patience were instrumental and we made it.The finishing shots turned out great!
I strongly recommend Guy and for sure, I will use his services again in the future.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Guy is very skilled and very professional! He has been doing this for a long time and has seen in all. I was a little nervous at first, but he gave direction very well and was always fabulously patient with me. We started the appointment with a general consult to work out the best looks to do for the photos and from there Guy took care of all the rest.
I highly recommend his photography!</Text>< Rate>

Very easy going, super professional, very affordable AND super fast!
I was only in town for a few days- Guy scheduled an appointment for the next day. Got my headshots right away and the retouched pictures within hours. I loved, that he directed me through the shooting. I never felt insecure or lost and the most important thing: the pictures turned out amazing and I’m very happy with the results. Thumbs up! 👍🏻< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Fantastic personality, great quality, and absolutely reliable. We needed a professional headshot for a corporate brochure so we called Guy after looking through reviews for over a dozen studios in West LA. I normally can't pose for photos without looking stiff and awkward, but Guy had expert pointers which turned out some truly stunning images. On top of that his touch-ups looked fantastic! Guy was also quick to respond to any questions and always kept us in the loop. We really couldn't have asked for anything more, and we'll definitely be recommending him to friends and colleagues.</text><Response>{'time': 1594305005139, 'text': '🙏☺️👍'}</Response>< time>

As someone who’s never had professional pictures taken before, I really appreciated the comprehensive approach that he took to shooting me. Great environment, great photographer, and a great guy.

5 is not enough stars to rate THIS GUY!!!!  My daughter in love took my identical twin grand babies to get some photos that she needed at the last minute, and not only was he accommodating, he was warm, experienced and professional.  His prices were beyond reasonable and he smelled GOOD!!!!  Our next shoot will definitely be with GUY!!!  He is now in charge of capturing their growth!!!!  WE LOVE YOU GUY!!!!

Sincerely,

Spirit, Janelle and the Henry Twins, Lyza and Lyric!<//Text>

Best photographer I have worked with in LA. I have shot several headshots with various LA photographers over the past 5 years, and none have been like Guy. He knows what he's doing, all you have to do is show up and trust what he tells you. He is super easy to work with, fun, and will not just capture 'pretty' or 'attractive' images of you, but he will somehow magically capture your essence. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for new headshots. Guy is your guy!! It's a fun time with him :)<//text>

<text>Guy is AMAZING! I was lucky enough to find him for my first time doing head shots, and I am so pleased with the outcome. He is a phonomenal photographer, and has a great eye for quality shots. He also plays great music and creates a great environment with positive energy. I will definitely come back for head shot updates in the future.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Guy is simply the best.
He understands photography for actors. Very detail oriented yet very easy to shoot with.
Hadn't used Guy in years and well, I should have.
He produces amazing shots and he's  a aware of what is happening as he shoots. no bad surprises later.
His studio has an indoor and outdoor area for optimum lighting conditions.
Very gentle in his demeanor the session is like visiting a friend ,</Text><GmapID>0x80c2b97ebfa25aef:0xb8a66c9e6e8ea04d</GmapID>< user_id>

<text>Guy was so fun to work with!  He is extremely professional, efficient, and makes it enjoyable.  He has a wonderful outdoor shaded studio.  His prices are ridiculously fair... especially for what all you get.  He was shooting my 13 year old son, who is new to this business.  His shyness and nervousness were apparent in his demeanor.  Guy didn't know how hard he was going to have to work!  Guy was able to educate my son so that he could get the shots that he needed....  and he definitely got the shots!  Did I mention that Guy is gorgeous??< /text><gmapID>0x80c2b97ebfa25aef:0xb8a66c9e6e8ea04d<//gmapID><user_id>106525781250809289998</user_id>< Rating>

Guy was recommended by a friend and I could not have been more pleased with the results. The consummate professional, his experience is revealed the moment you arrive at his studio. He is easy to talk to which allows you to relax throughout the session. Although he has a great eye for detail he moves from one pose to the next wasting little of your time. My agent, friends and casting have all commented positively about my new shots so when it’s time for new ones, I won’t hesitate to visit Guy again.<//Review>

Guy Viau is AMAZING! He is truly a gifted photographer who makes you feel comfortable and understands what the industry is looking for. We had a hard time deciding which shots to use because there were so many great ones. My daughter is new to the industry and has gotten a couple of commercials and a television show under her belt in the 2.5 months that she worked with Guy and his talented wife. Many Thank You's for your wonderful shots. I highly recommend Guy Viau!< /review>

I seriously have trouble deciding which pictures to keep as finals because they're all SO FRIGGIN' GOOD!! First of all, he's an absolute pleasure to work with and his chill and smooth way of communicating makes everything much more enjoyable and relaxing.

This was my first photo shoot, which included portraits as an artist as well as head shots and all my expectations were surpassed in every way. I'm amazed at how he's able to catch the "golden pics" as we go, and his level of creativity combined with his professionalism made the shoot lots of fun.

His tips, direction and encouragement surely made the session worth every penny- and he even gave me some gifts on top of that!!. It was definitely a valuable learning experience as well thanks to his wisdom from both sides of the camera. Plus, the studio vibe is super pleasant with candles and a really nice homey feel. He's certainly in the circle of the best of the best and from now on my go to guy for my upcoming photo shoots and updated head shots.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<review>First off, Guy really is amazing and makes you feel very comfortable when shooting. When I first arrived I was pretty nervous and i didn't think Guy would be able to get a good shot of me because i didn't think that i was photogenic but he told me not to worry and he promised that he would be able to get MANY good shots...and he was right. When i looked at my photos after i absolutely loved them! Guy is able to capture something in your eyes that other photographers can't do and thats what i loved about the photos. He also makes you feel very relaxed and if you don't know what to do he tells you so that you feel comfortable. If it's head shots that your looking for i would definitely recommend Guy to take them, you won't regret it, plus you'll have a great while your taking them:)</review></record></dataset><record>

His environment was very comfortable, and he helped me to evoke feelings in my shots that I didnt know I could portray.

He was great, and I am definitely going to go back!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Start to finish, I had a great experience with Guy. I'd done a lot of searching before I finally settled on him because I liked his philosophy and loved his photos. It was my first time getting headshots done but I felt immediately comfortable when within two minutes of meeting me, Guy had a clear vision of my types, suggested the best clothes for the job, and explained the 'why' of each look. We shot five looks and I left with a huge variety within each. I ended up getting nine retouched (couldn't narrow it down any more than that!), and I'm so happy with all of them. Thanks, Guy!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Guy is a great photographer.  He takes over so you can relax.  He knows what to say to stop you from being self conscious and he knows light.  How light changes the shot.  How to make you look real and good.

I apologize if my review is quite lengthy, but the experience I had with this man and his service deserves each and every word written.
I had googled headshots nearby in Orange County, but considered LA since it’s in the heart of the entertainment business. The first and only place that caught my eye was Guy Viau Photography. I had a gut instinct to go with him, and so I called him immediately and told him my interest with headshots and getting started in the film/tv industry and commercial print. He assured me I was working with a top class photographer that knew exactly what he was doing, and he was not wrong.
The photoshoot was amazing. For someone that is new to the industry and photo shoots itself, he made me feel comfortable, confident and guided me with each look on what to do. I can’t stress enough, if you need a photographer for any reason, seek Guy Viau and give him a call. I promise you, you won’t regret it.
I already know I’ll be working again with him in the future. Thank you Guy! I appreciate everything you have helped me with.<//Review>

<Review>I highly recommend Guy Viau for any type of photography work.  He was the second headshot photographer I used in Los Angeles when I wanted to get some updated shots.  He told me my main problem was going to be having too many to choose from, and after going through all 350+ on my CD, I thought “Wow, Guy was right!”  He really does great work.  His home studio has a laid back atmosphere which is really relaxing, plus Guy is easy going and doesn’t rush you at all.  Unlike a lot of photographers, there was no time limit to our session based on how many looks I was getting – we were shooting until we got the shots we wanted, and Guy let me take as long as I needed to get changed between looks.

What I liked most about our session was Guy’s attention to detail and his directions.  He was very helpful telling me how to position myself to get the most photogenic shots.  Then he made sure my clothes and hair looked good as well, coming over to adjust things as necessary.  Basically, he handled all the little things, and it paid off in the end.  For example - when I looked at my three quarter shots, the way I was sitting looked natural, and my clothes looked great on me, because Guy had made sure everything looked good as we were taking the pictures.

I did a ton of research for these headshots, and looked at dozens of photographers.  Guy’s the real deal, and he’s a good guy too, which makes the session fun.  You can tell he cares about doing great work.  It’s not just about taking a few hundred pictures or making some money, he wants to get the best pictures possible.  His rates are also really good, especially when compared to other top photographers.  If you’re getting pictures taken, you should check out his site.< /Review><response>None<//response>< Time>

If you need headshots for a professional use—hire Guy! It is quick, painless, and inexpensive. I called on a Monday afternoon and by end of day Wednesday I had two amazing headshots, suitable for all of my professional needs. By Thursday afternoon, one of them had been published in an international trade publication—so well worth every penny.  I would have been mortified had I gone with my earlier ideas of getting a friend to take a few snaps.
He is so professional, experienced, efficient—he knows the art of the headshot well and dials it in immediately. You get all of your images before you leave your session, my 45-minute shoot had almost 500 pictures! He gives your selected images the most polished retouching, leaving you looking like a slightly better version of you and not too overdone.< /review>

What I liked most about our session was Guy’s attention to detail and his directions.  He was very helpful telling me how to position myself to get the most photogenic shots.  Then he made sure my clothes and hair looked good as well, coming over to adjust things as necessary.  Basically, he handled all the little things, and it paid off in the end.  For example - when I looked at my three quarter shots, the way I was sitting looked natural, and my clothes looked great on me, because Guy had made sure everything looked good as we were taking the pictures.

I did a ton of research for these headshots, and looked at dozens of photographers.  Guy’s the real deal, and he’s a good guy too, which makes the session fun.  You can tell he cares about doing great work.  It’s not just about taking a few hundred pictures or making some money, he wants to get the best pictures possible.  His rates are also really good, especially when compared to other top photographers.  If you’re getting pictures taken, you should check out his site.</text>

If your looking for a photographer Guy Viau is highly recommended. He is one of the best photographer's in Los Angeles. I was so happy with the outcome and had so much fun while shooting. Guy makes you feel comfortable and puts you at ease and therefore you give your best because you're in the moment and enjoting it. I have recieved great feed back from my agent, casting, and my friends, and that says it all.</Text>

I highly recommend Guy Viau. He was the first headshot photographer I hired in Los Angeles when I was told by my commercial agent that I needed new pics.

I've gotten headshots 3 times before Guy, and my experience shooting with Guy was by far the best of all 3.  Guy is precise and professional, and made sure to get exactly what I needed.

He communicated very well, even when I wasn't so sure what I was looking for, and advised me on what I'd need based on how I planned on using the shots. Guy is relaxed and gives you all the time you need.  Guy's attention to detail, direction, style advice and wardrobe help, and was just perfect. He even helped with my hair, which is curly and can be unruly.

I also loved his home studio, which is laid back and comfortable.

Guy does great work and he's wonderful to work with. His rates are amazing for the photography he provides, and I plan on always going back to him. There's no reason to use anyone else!</Text>

This was the first time I've taken my headshots with Guy & I must say I will be back! He's so professional & knows how to work with you. The bonus with Guy is that he will suggest what will look good on you with the look(s) you want with your wardrobe. Guy has a great eye for the finished product! If you want excellent headshots the first time around get them done with Guy. You won't be disappointed!  :)</review>

Guy Viau is an extremely talented photographer and I am beyond thrilled with my duaughers head shots . He is professional as well as very personable making my 16 year old daughter very  first professional shoot a delightful experience. Guy took  his time to ensure my daughter had the best looks for her. He made my daughter feel comfortable  as well as giving her exceptional direction  and was able to capture her personality and beauty  though his lens!
Guy is  also prompt with returning emails and phone calls.
I can not say enough good things about  Guy but if you are looking for incredible photographer, I highly recommend Guy Viau.<//text>

I wish I could give Guy more than 5 stars!! 5 stars doesn't give him enough credit. Guy took fabulous photographs of my 10 year-old daughter.  He not only spent a lot of time on the phone with me before the shoot, describing the process and what I needed to bring, but when we got there he helped put together amazing looks with the clothes we brought. Guy was kind, gentle, and patient (with all of us..haha) before, during, and after the shoot. He described in detail how he wanted my daughter to pose and smile. He had music playing; the atmosphere was light, easy, and fun. The photos came out AMAZING! ...best she's ever taken. I can't see us using anybody else in the future.  Thanks soooo much Guy!  Looking forward to next time. Sincerely, Lamitra Baez< /Review>

Guy Viau is quite simply the best photographer I've ever encountered. He first photographed me for a new headshot in 2014. I was thrilled with the results. He's one of those people who just has a great eye, a thorough knowledge of photography and lighting, and a real knack for capturing your best self. He knows what it's like being on the subject's side of the camera, since he once worked as a model, so he's a master at helping a subject relax and getting things just right. I went back to him in March of 2017 for an updated headshot and I was equally pleased with the results. Highest recommendation for Guy Viau Photography. He's very reasonably priced as well, prompt with delivery, and excellent at the retouching process.< /review>

It's never easy trying to find the right headshot photographer, but with Guy Viau I know that I made the right decision. Guy's work is absolutely AMAZING! I am over the moon with my headshots. I still can't believe how incredible they turned out. Guy is truly talented and extremely professional. He devotes a significant amount of time helping you establish the "looks" that you are wanting to achieve. He has a keen eye for detail, and plays a crucial role in helping to style you in both wardrobe and hair and makeup. Guy takes the time to ensure that even the slightest detail, such as a hair out of place is perfect before he shoots. His experience not only behind the camera but in front of it as a fashion model, certainly translates in his remarkable work. It was so difficult selecting which headshots I wanted to use, as they were all so great. Guy made the experience so memorable, and I definitely look forward to shooting with him again.< /Review>

I am so happy and thankful to Meena for referring me to the Best Ever Photographer, especially in L.A., He not only knows his biz from behind the camera, he is also well versed In Front of the Camera as a former model. Guy is the finest in his line of business. Very professional, and very comfortable to be working with. Especially when your a woman, he's a good looking man and buttoning/or un-buttoning your blouse for the next shot, does not make you feel at all uncomfortable. He makes you look like you never knew you could ! I hated my photo to be taken until I saw what Guy can do for you ! Give him a call, make an appointment and get the best headshots you've ever seen of yourself.</text><pics>None<//pics><name>Mercedes Georgina McQueen<//name>< Response>

< Review>
Last week (mid Dec 2020), I dropped by this shop to fix an issue with my car. My car works perfect except that it doesn't give me "warm" air. Only cold air from A/C. After their initial investigation (not free), they recommended me to change thermostat along with two hoses because thermostat fails to open a valve for engine properly, which is the cause of the issue. I told them I don't see any wrong signal from the engine, but they kept recommending me to change the thermostat (sitting next to engine). I believed their expertise and let them replace the thermostat. Unfortunately, as I expected, it didn't help to fix the issue with my car. For this, they spent almost 3 hours. Because that didn't help, they recommended me to replace radiator, which costs me more than $400 additionally. (For the thermostat, they charged me more than $350 already) I was not able to afford that amount of money and decided not to replace the radiator. Once I got home, I borrowed OBD from my friend and install it onto my car to read engine temperature. I kept my car engine up and running and put some stress on the engine for testing. As I expected, I confirmed that fan on the radiator blows out "warm/hot" air and temperature of engine coolant is normal. This means that radiator works great. I think the thermostat that replaced was also working fine. (but they replaced it and charged more that $300 to me.) I think they don't know what they are doing at least for heater. Unfortunately, I made full payment to them and cannot make any pennies back now. Waste of money and waste of time. so sad..</Review>

Was assisted by Corky at the front desk. Went in for new front tires and alignment. Later, get a call telling me my front control arms are at the brink of failing and unless they were replaced he couldn't go through with the alignment, quoted me $950 + $300 for original service. Declined and picked up my car and looked into pricing elsewhere.

Freeman Frame and Alignment - $500
JR Alignment Tires Corporation - $500
Firestone - $900

I wound up paying $700 with alignment included. That being said, this place seems solid but is expensive.<//Text>

As I was drive to a site to work security.  The company vehicle rear right side tire blew out. Quickly contacted a tow service then Googled a nearby tire service shop and the Tire Outlet was listed as being nearby.
The tow service arrived and took me to the outlet.  Quickly I was greeted by a very friendly Corky.  Quickly he assessed my needs and gave a very reasonable price.
The was quickly replaced and also purchased a second tire to have a balance in the rear.
The staff worked quickly and very skillfully.
Within a short time my vehicle was ready and the transaction was done smoothly with effortlessly well executed.
Highly recommend this business for your tire service needs and they also do other maintenance service.  You will not be disappointed<//review>

< Review>
As we prepared to evacuate our homes due to the CZU wildfire, my husband realized that the front tires on my car were completely bald. He said it was an absolute priority once we were safely evacuated that we get new tires since he was concerned about even driving it. Tire Outlet was the first place we called and they immediately told us they could get us in and set up an appointment time. We got there, exhausted and overwhelmed and they were so kind and friendly and helpful. While they were doing the tires, the owner came and let us know that our alignment was way off but said he didn't want to make us do it then but if we wanted too, he could have it done right then as well. We were so grateful for his non-aggressive manner when suggesting a new service and gratefully took him up on it. The price for the tires and alignment was fair and they did god and quick work. I highly recommend them.</Review>

<Review>Recently I required several significant repairs for my vehicle and brought it to Tire Outlet, on a friend's suggestion. I was received warmly by my service rep, and got good vibes from everyone. It's an old car and it needed repairs that ran well into the four digit range. I'm very happy with the result, and I wouldn't hesitate to return here the next time I need work done.<//Review><UserId.>103734254097492620896<//UserId.>< Response>

If your going for tires just know it’s $900 for all four replaced , and that’s the basic / cheapest set . Only gets more expensive. I drive a 2004 Honda Civic ....</Text>

I've been coming here for over 10 years to get tires. Great prices, honest people, and they do good work!! Free tire patches, if you buy tires here. That's why I'm here today found a screw in my tire, told me to come in and they will fix! I TRUST the people that work here. I won't go any place else for tires. They also do mechanical work, they had to fox my husband's Jeep, stuff he didn't have the tools himself to do. And he would rather do the work himself than get hustle by someone, but he trusts the people here!</Text>

A few months ago I took my wife's car in for a brake check. The brake disc was rusted to the car. They still maintained the original price they estimated. They had to go buy a part to hammer the disc out. All-in-all, they charged the original estimated hour and a half for a 3-hour job. They're very hard-working people and I would take any car there for some regular wheel maintenance. Very nice people. The dealership never told us about the brake disc.< /review>

Great place been coming here for yrs. They are so professional &  they are the only ones I trust fixing my cars. Being a woman you fear going to a mechanic because they know your not knowledgeable when it comes to cars & fear being taken advantage of but not here. Thank you guys for being the best.<//Review>

Nice privately owned and operated car service and tire store. I found them honest and hard working. And this is from a diy guy so I know a thing or two about cars. Recommended without reservation over anyone else in downtown. I did try a few before using these. Won't use anyone else period.< /text>

REMS is an awesome property management company.  During my client's escrow I reached out to Susana Rodriguez for some urgent documents, she went above and beyond by providing the documents over the weekend and forwarded them directly to our lender without being asked.  After the escrow closing, her prompt (almost immediate response) to the new owner's questions helped her greatly in settling down at her new home.  REMS's service excellence is rare among property management companies!<//Text>

Wow, I honestly can't believe some of the poor reviews I've just finished reading.  My experience has been top of the line with REMS from it's inception to the signing of my lease.  My first point of contact was the very sweet Doris, who was helpful and kind.  She suggested an apartment for me that was affordable and in an area I liked, so I viewed it and fell in love.   I applied on a Saturday and was contacted that evening by Joseph via text for additional information, and within 4 days, I was approved for the apartment.  After Joseph, I dealt primarily with Yelma, who by the way is the consummate professional, and I was impressed with her interest in helping me get into my new apartment.  When we went over the lease, she was thorough and patient and answered every single question I had before I could ask it, lol.  These are genuine people , they run a good business, and I can't say enough how pleased I am with my apartment.  Its well taken care of and quiet, just the way I hoped it would be.  I highly recommend REMS to anyone looking for a new place to live because what you will undoubtedly get is professional service, nice, clean, well taken care of spaces, and a touch of human kindness from all of their team.  Thanks guys at REMS!</review>

<Review>I lived in one of their properties for a long period of time, and R.E.M.S. Inc was always incredibly understanding and willing to work with me, especially now, during these uncertain times. They are very efficient, and attended to every problem I had almost immediately. I can't recommend them enough.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

When REMS took over the management of our building, I was skeptical - we had worked so well directly with our landlord for so long, I was afraid a management company would make things difficult. However, I couldn't have been more wrong - REMS was responsive, thorough and friendly, and very accommodating during our move-out process when we had to move internationally for work. Joseph and the team are great and made everything so easy. Thank you!<//Text>

Both Kelly and Joseph make sure that our needs regarding our rental properly are met in a timely manner. They have friendly office staff and are very accommodating and return calls quickly. Whenever there has been anything that needed to be repaired, they always took care of things right away. We have never had to be concerned about whether or not things were going to be taken care of. They are easy to reach and work with reliable service providers as well as having up to date online services like their online tenant portal. This makes your rent payments super easy and convenient.

<text>My experience with them has so far been great. The woman at the front desk (sorry, can't remember her name) greeted me with a smile every time I had to stop by the office.  Yelma has been very helpful throughout my application process and made finding a new apartment, which is not easy in LA, less difficult.  She personally sat down with me to go over all the details, and always made herself available, even when I was late to my appointment.  My experience with management companies have not been the best here, but they have been some of the nicest.</text>< user_id>

<text>Like someone here said, do we have to give them a star? I applied for a house to this Co. called two days in row until someone picked up the phone, I asked for the house I was applying for, and said that they have already rented it to someone with better credit score than me. I am not buying a house, neither competing with other people. What a Scam, no one call me to tell me that they had already rented it to someone else, neither an email, nothing! on top of it my credit card was charged twice.

<Time>1551910517143<//Time><rate>5</rate><review>Everyday LIFE .. when juggling so many things whether it be work or school (maybe even both), personal life, LA traffic, parenthood and such much more it's actually really commendable to come across someone who still likes what they do for a living and takes a moment to care about the people they come in contact with. Well I am beyond pleased to say that was my experience with Yelma Rojo.

From the moment her and I spoke, I felt more at ease in regards to my dealings with R.E.M.S, Inc. Yelma didn't over talk me, she diligently explained things, but most importantly Yelma always listened to the customer (me) and was a woman of her word. That right there means so much and goes an extremely long way!!! In my case, she basically helped everything come full circle. She was my point of contact and she was happy to take all my calls (well at least I hope so :) ). Yelma's follow through and thoughtfulness was truly illustrated, and I am glad I got the opportunity to engage with her. Ms. Rojo  gets 10 gold stars in my book and I only hope other individuals and R.E.M.S, Inc. takes heed to that. In all work fields, more Yelma's are needed!

Thank you Yelma for your many acts of kindness while remaining professional at all times! You Rock!!!!!!!!!!

Sincerely,

<text>They are SCAMMERS, We applied to a house that we fell in love with. Brought proof of income that goes OVER x3 (closer to x4) the monthly amount of rent they were asking. We asked 1 of 2 agents (Joseph & Yelma) that helped us get scammed, if we needed to have good credit as we had dealt with fraud etc and knew for a fact this would be a problem if indeed excellent credit was something they were looking for. Joseph confirms credit wasnt a factor, they looked for no bankruptcy, no evictions, and proof of atleast x3 the monthly rent was what is important to them. We spoke to Joseph about us not having good credit and we wouldn't apply if that was the problem. Again Joseph reconfirmed it was not a problem. Yelma takes care of us next and we are required to prove every type of income possible, we attach about 40 or more files with month to month pay stubs, w2, pensions, and more. After being tossed around for several weeks Yelma calls us and let's us know our application was rejected because of credit. ARE YOU SERIOUS. My whole family feels ripped off and feels they were trying to find any way to reject us and keep application money, we probably werent the only ones this happened to at this location. R.E.M.S YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF BUSINESS MY FATHER FELT HIGHLY TRICKED AND DISRESPECTED. We have been home owners for over 15 years in a highly demanded area of West Los Angeles and have been approved for renting in West LA but this home in Inglewood has been the hardest and most stressful application.
I will be writing this message on every type of review page and social media platform they have linked.
After they rejected our application they did not offer any type of help they simply we're done, even other companies have told us they would help us find a home to rent that meets requirements.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1551210502785, 'text': "Melissa,\n\nThe main reason your application set was denied was we could not verify the income stated, and upon further inquiry and questioning it was revealed you had another income source from a marijuana related business. You could only provide bank statements, but no tax returns. You did not disclose this other income and it's source until after we advised you the application and information provided would not qualify for approval.\n\nConsidering the poor credit, lack of verifiable income, and the idea you would use part of the premises for your marijuana related business we denied your application. We're allowed to deny applications for legal and legitimate reasons, and I suspect that's why the federal bureau of business never contacted us.\n\nJoseph"}</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b451f9e32b9b:0xca2e14067869d8f4< /Gmap_id></record>

Called this Company re: a vacancy on Friday Nov. 21, 2014 at 10 am. A woman (who just started there) got on the phone and was pushing this "Black Friday Special". Its a scam.
She told me I'd get first month free if I would wait a week  until Friday,  Nov. 28, 2014, and put my application in at exactly 9 am.. Otherwise she makes the landlord wait a week for his money and/OR they collect first and last. (BTW: you would have to pay the $30.00/ per adult appl. fee AND get your applic, approved on that same Friday AND also sign the lease on that SAME Friday. Sounds fishy to me and I don't trust it. Seems like you would want to start getting the rent if I were the Landlord. (and get a renter)<//review>

It was not a scam, but it was an unwise way to market and rent units and that\'s why it will never happen again.\n\nIf you wish to reach out to me directly at 310-793-9502 I\'ll do what I can to make it right.\n\nJoseph'}<//response>

Paying rent and money owed is obviously important and the entire relationship is based on the concept of property owners provide housing and you pay the agreed upon rental rate, but I believe this relationship (like most all) must be a two-way street with give and take for both the residents and the property owners.\n\nIf you did have a bad experience please reach out to me directly at 310-793-9502 so I can make it right.\n\nJoseph"}</resp>

Do we even have to give a star ? This company is essentially operated and owned by Joseph. They have no other concern except collecting his money. They will not help in any other way< /review>

< review>
Okay, so I was actually trying to go to Aloha Hawaiian barbecue next door but they were temporarily closed. I looked at the reviews and while there are clearly some fake five-star reviews on there (very American names with very American pictures, but with the kind of grammar you only get from a non-native speaker) there were enough others that I figured I'd give it a shot.

We will start with the good: 1.They are the friendliest people you will ever find in a restaurant. 2. The price paid per amount of food is quite good. A two item combo could fill up 2-3 hungry adults for $10.

The less good: The food is just okay. I ordered mushroom chicken and the house special chicken, and neither one were anything to write home about. They tasted pretty similar and there wasn't a lot of flavor in either. If you use the hot sauce, all you will taste is the hot sauce.

That said, the quality of the ingredients was reasonable for the kind of place it is, so the value proposition remains decent.

It would be a fantastic place to go if you had to feed a group of teenagers on a budget.<//review>

This place is my go to place for Chinese food. They have great customer service, the food is great and the establishment is taken care of. They only accept cash but this is the best chinese food spot I have been to and I have been going to for about 9 years now.Give them a try because you definitely won't regret it!< /Text>

<text>CASH ONLY...not an issue if you carry cash. We went to get cash and came back because I didnt want to pay an atm fee....It was VERY WORTH the drive to get cash! I wish we didnt live 300 miles away. The food tasted amazing, the portions were huge AND they knew most of their customers by name. Will definitely be back when we visit!< /text>< Rate>

<text>The staff is friendly and pretty clean inside. But the food was very very dry. I barely ate any orange chicken. And I kind of had to force myself to eat the teriyaki chicken. The noodles were also very dry... idk if the food was sitting a very long time but it wasn’t good at all. And beware they only take cash and they point you to their atm that they charge you extra! You’ll pay 2.50 more. It’s smart for them to do this little scam but not for everyone else. Cash only.< /text></record></dataset><record>

However, this was one of the worst experiences I've had at any restaurant. Went as far as calling the police. I called back told them if was pointless but in the end we wasted the our time and money at this place. Don't give these people a chance to keep treating patrons like garbage. At this point it isn't about the food they could have the best orange chicken I have ever tasted. It's the mere principle of the fact that their customer service is horrendous. If I wasn't happy their food in the first place why would I want to switch it out? They refused to give us our money back when we were clearly dissatisfied.< /Text>< Rating>

I had orange chicken with fried rice.....very dissapointed. All I can say is bland & disgusting. Their was a spider on our plate. We left at 8:56pm,their was still people inside eating & they turned their lights off on customers inside eating. I don't know how the owner allows this. I will never go back & I will let everyone I know not to go there. Update:Yes spider you read right!!!! Disgusting! Don't go there!</Review>

<text>This place is terrible. Yes they give good portions....but quality is poor. I got 3 large side dishes...Beef & broccoli, orange chicken and spicy beef $8 each and it all tasted like it came from a microwave tv dinner. Beef & broccoli was 20% beef & 80% broccoli.veggies in spicy beef was overcooked, limp, soggy and not spicy at all. Orange chicken was hard on the outside & rubbery on the inside. Ive had better chinese quality from places located in grocery stores.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd289664bb34e9:0x685108d0bdad9806</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Decent, had worse but had much better. Has some mild spice to the curry, but the chicken in said curry was bland. Mushrooms a little undercooked in mushroom chiken but has a nice sauce. Chow mein noodles where so so, cooked long enough but bland.< /Text>

This place is delicious and cheap! I dont know what the negative reviews are talking about because I've been coming here for chinese food for YEARS and have NEVER experienced half the stuff they talk about.
They have always been super nice to me and I've never had foreign objects in my food (i.e insects, hair, etc)
The only downside is that their drinks are overly priced, but I guess the cheap food makes up for it<//text>

<Text>Absolutely bad horrific scam. I have the row52 app. Saw a vehicle came in and went the next day. It only been 1 day 4hrs and the vehicle no where insight. Also came for other vehicle that came in 4 days ago no where insight. Ask the staff little to no help said it was there but it ain't. Check the hole section not he row just in case misplace but the whole section and looked and each vehicle in the section, Also the yard is a complete mess came on (Sunday) I have been to ipull-upull Stockton , Pick-n-pull San Jose, Newark, Stockton, Oakland, Richmond. All have cleaner yard and more helpful staff.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great place to find a lot of the items for repairs.
A large variety of cars and trucks to choose from. Parts are fairly priced and the personal are very friendly and helpful.  I definitely recommend this place to any mechanic, handyman or simply car user or driver.< /Text>

<Review>Found what I needed last minute, though I only had 15mins till close, and the staff was not very helpful in me being successful in my search, in fact I believe they intentionally hindered me. Knowing I specified the vehicle I was looking for, gave directions but not the directions I would need walking out of the door to the car's yard, allowed me to head in the opposite direction then I needed to be headed with toolbox in tow.< /Review>< Pictures>

It was the cleanest pick n pull I've ever been to but it also looks to be a new facility. Nice attendance at the entrance.</Text>

My life partner, Jerry has been a customer of picknpull since they opened ( usually Richmond yard and occasionally Oakland).  We know their policies and haven't ever had a problem.
Jerry is a retired veteran, and has been a self- employed mechanic for a very long time.
Recently we moved to Vallejo so have been going to the Fairfield yard more. We thought we would check out the new American canyon yard.

So he ended up pulling a motor from an Impala for a client of his from this yard for $310 on 10/27. Took it home and installed it. Took the core in on 10/31 (the cashier neglected to return the original receipt of the purchase - although he didn't realize this until days later).
The motor ended up having a cracked head, so he took it back to that yard and was expecting to get the credit due him so he could find another motor to replace it but instead got told that he would get a call, which we never recieved ( this was when he realized the receipt was not in his possession anymore).
RICHMOND ALWAYS STAPLED THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE RECEIPT TO THE CORE RECEIPT -KUDOS TO RICHMOND!.
So, on the next Monday, we took the motor back (again) and asked for Sonny, the manager. And because we didn't have the original receipt ( but we had the core receipt which has a reference to the original receipt's number on it) - he said he couldn't (wouldn't, actually)do anything for Jerry!!
We put a complaint in;  another one to Schnitzer; contacted the Ethics point company; contacted 7 on your side; no response from anyone!!
THIS HELLA IRKS US!! ALL HE WANTS IS THE $280 CREDIT THAT IS RIGHTFULLY HIS!! THE CASHIER IS THE ONE AT FAULT HERE! THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE THAT, THOUGH. SO THE CUSTOMER LOSES! SO MUCH FOR THE STATEMENTS MADE UNDER THE 'INTEGRITY' PART OF THE COMPANY POLICIES! THIS IS ONLY
REGARDING THE PICKNPULL YARD AT AMERCAN CANYON! THEY SUCK!<//review>

<text>With Dave and Francine, you not only get a great cut and shave experience and (more importantly) a consistent cut every time, you also get a good show with their back and forth banter.

Ah it's such a pleasure to be given the venerable shave-and-a-haircut by experts of the craft. In London the expertise to deal with a lifelong beard is nonexistent now so it's an absolute relief to be given an upgrade to the old style by people who not only have an understanding of their craft but an instinctive ability to make you look gooooood<//Review>

I can describe this place in one word - AMAZING!  Dave has mad skills!  I was in town for work, needed a cut and took the risk.  He said anyone can cut your hair the first time, but a second time is a different story.  I got so many compliments from so many people about my cut, I might just have to fly down to get it with Dave again.< /Review>

Having recently moved to Beverly Hills, I was pleasantly surprised to see such a great deal being offered for a men's haircut at an independent barber shop.  I received a fantastic haircut for half the price of what similar places charged me in the past.  Francine and David are also very fun and made the experience very enjoyable.   I definitely see myself becoming a regular here!<//Review>

I am not a guy that gets way into hair. I usually get a cut, and I'm good to go. However, when I went here, the guys were awesome to talk to and chill with. But when it was all done, I had the best hair cut ever! Like, it was done professionally with actual straight razors, etc. It was tapered perfectly, trimmed neatly and the sideburns looked amazing. So I recommend this place 100%. Dang good place to go if you want to look nice!< /Text>

The first time I came to the shop I asked David to "just make me look good" and I gotta say, he nailed it. I liked it so much I keep coming back! David's got the classic barber skills and attitude to boot. A+</Review>

Dave and Francine are the best at what they do. Ever since I moved from PA, I had been looking for a shop to go to that was as relaxed and skilled as the one I went to throughout my High school years (Miss you, Mike!).

Almost as soon as I walked in, I felt relaxed and in good hands. The way they banter and chat with each other and clients, while also maintaining laser focus and attention to detail on their cuts is master class.

I have yet to get a cut from Dave, but Francine has knocked every single haircut and beard shave I've gotten right out of the park. I feel like a million bucks every time I leave the shop. 5/5 I'll be a regular at this shop for as long as their doors are open and I live in Tucson.</Text>

<Review>Being somewhat new to Tucson, I've been going to different barbers to see which I'd make a habit of going to. This being a Sunday I was limited by the number of places that were open but luckily Cut and Shave was one of these.

I was initially concerned by a one-star review which indicated that the reviews for this business were all a scam but I’m pleased to say that my concerns were totally unfounded.

I loved Francine’s work and enjoyed the friendly banter between both barbers and the banter with the clients. The atmosphere was very relaxing and enjoyable and I’m totally going back for my next haircut!<//Review>< UserId.>

I desperately needed a haircut and shave after no-shave November and Francine helped me out.  They are extremely detailed and like to talk and analyze best practices and methods throughout the process.  They definitely put thought and care into what they do and the three of them(Francine, Dave and Jimmy) talk like an old married couple.  Good people, good place and if I'm in Tucson and need a haircut I'll be back.  If not I hope to see them on the so-cal waves.</text>

The reviews for this business has to be a SCAM! For starters why would a business that cuts your hair not have a mirror in front of the chair?
I'll make this short. I just moved to Tucson and read the reviews here and thought this would be safe? Jimmy asked what I wanted and I told him I just needed to clean up what I had. I never asked for anything different. What he did was pick up a clipper and OFF ALL MY HAIR. Believe this review and look elsewhere!!!<//Text>

<text>The main guy at this place was hungover when he cut my hair, and to make matters worse, while he was cutting my hair, he was telling me to stop moving or else he could accidently cut me.  Ummmm, sir, your hungover, I'm not moving, your moving because your recovering from a night out.  The guy was unprofessional.  Will not go back again

This is the place to go. I was sick of taking the gamble of run of the mill hack jobs cutting my hair. So I decided to do my research and this is where I ended. First let me say I have never met Dave the owner but I have had my hair cut by both Jimmy as well as Francine. They are excellent in the trade and take pride in what they do. They charge a very reasonable price for the value. I personally believe these people are the best at what they do in tucson with exceptional prices.

In regards to the guy below me (Michael Rogers) I was there when he got his cut. I'm curious why people hold back so much. He seemed very pleased when he left? I dont understand why you can't let the barber know exactly what you wanted in the first place. If you dont, understand that style (outdated style especially looking like you done walked out of the 70s) is very subjective. You must tell the barber more than "take a little off." Give some reference to where you want to end up. You could say "I want to be like Kenny Rogers or Willie Nelson" or something you know? A real gentleman would understand that telling the barber what you want FIRST (key word is first)... is the first step towards getting the hair cut you wanted (to remind you incase you had forgotten, it is a hair CUT.) I bid on him having a conflicting interest and he probably owns a barber shop or knows some one who does.<//review>

This was a holiday weekend disaster. Sewer clogged, all the toilets in house backed up and toilet water backing up into shower and tub drains. Technician was at the house within 40 minutes of calling.  He was thorough, professional and did an amazing job cleaning out the clogged pipes. Holiday weekend continued flowing smoothly. Very pleased.<//Text>

<text>Woke up to flooding in my kitchen last night.  I turned off water to house cleaned up the mess and called for repairs this morning.  By noon my kitchen was back to working order and I couldn’t be happier with the customer service, the technician or the results.  What I especially favored was how Christopher explained everything so well that I understood what had happened and why.  He went out of his way to ensure that he knew about the history of the plumbing in my older double wide mobile and that I was educated on the historical recall situation of the pipe my home has.  He clearly explained the options and wanted me to understand what was involved.  He made a couple of calls to search for any other possible alternatives using speakerphone each time. He made a short run for parts and explained what he needed and why they didn’t carry it on the truck.  The actual time it took him for the repair was short and he had me inspect the work and wanted me to be aware of how to turn off the valve just in case anything might happen in the future.  Many thanks for kindness to an old woman, his tidiness in my kitchen and how respectful he was.</text>< Pics>

Telephone operator was friendly.  Very positive about being able to dispatch a plumber on a Sunday afternoon.  Text updates on status of call were nice.  Trey was very professional and looked into situation right away.  Worked hard to solve the problem and I would say he went above and beyond what I expected.  Price was as quoted so no surprises.  All in all very happy with experience.<//review>

<Review>They came and provided a general estimate without opening anything up to actually know what the issue is.  Seems like the supervisor guy just guessed on what the problem he thinks is. The estimate was $500.

I have scheduled an appointment with someone else to come by and provide an estimate. I can update this review once that happens and what I actually end up paying for resolving the problem.

I was not happy with roto rooter. Be reasonable.

Update: I got it done for $150/labor+ $50/part today from a local plumber. Will never call Roto Rooter again.<//Review>< Pictures>

The personal service and professionalism were awesome. I do feel that the service is double the price it should be. The sticker shock was unbelievable and should be brought up while scheduling.
The gentleman that came out was very kind considerate and very pleasant to deal with as was the lady on the phone.< /Review>

They did not clean very good and charge $300.00 and they told me if you want to get cleaned all the way to main line then you have to pay $1,000.00. I told them that I can’t afford that much money that’s a lot of money. So anyway I went on Amazon and bought 100 ft  sewer jetter drain cleaner hose for $80.00 to use with my gas pressure washer and I did clean myself and everything got cleaned so well I was amazed and also did save a lot of money! Thanks Amazon and no more Roto Rotter 😡<//Text>

An excellent job was done installing our new toilet and getting our prior toilet to stop overflowing.  What I appreciate most was they came out on a Sunday and on a holiday to help us stop our toilet from overflowing, much appreciated!!< /text>

<review>Brandon came out and fixed us up. Great customer service, professional attitude, explained what was going on, and arrived promptly. Highly recommend this tech for any work you need done. For those interested; he wore a mask, covid awareness, cashless and paperless transactions.

Just wanted to give a 5 star review for the customers service we rec from these guys on a holiday weekend.
I called for a property owner that had a rentals toilet that had been down 3 days already.
They were booked but offered to move customers around in order to schedule us . Easter weekend at 8 pm. Everyone ~from tech that showed up on time at job to dispatch was super friendly nice and accommodating . They offer free quotes for any job and couldn't ask for better customer service .
Thank you !< /text>

Called and received a call back within a few minutes. Very professional/ detail orientated, and received a text message 20 minutes later with information on the technician, and a little Bit about himself. He showed up within a hour and quickly diagnosed and provided a great price for professional work done. I would recommend Stephen to anyone who needs plumbing service done. Thanks!</Review>

When scheduling the installation of a kitchen faucet (I supplied the new faucet), I asked what the estimated charge would be.  Customer service said they didn’t know but the technician would tell me.  Technician arrived and said standard (if standard why didn’t customer service give me the estimate?) installation charge is $250. Last time I used Roto Rooter, technician worked on dishwasher and charge was $69 for approximately one hour.  The faucet install took approximately one hour also.  $250 charge seemed arbitrary and unreasonably high. I think I’ll look for different plumber next time.  Service was good but price very unsatisfactory.</text>

Chris and Marcos arrived to determine parts of the toilet were bad causing the back up. Xhris replaced the toilet checking the drainage first to see it was fairly clean. Main problem was the toilet itself. I was glad I decided to have it replaced. Chris was professional explaining the process and showed me the picture of the line. He did find a piece of toilet paper attached to the side if the pipe that would have caused a problem later so he cleaned it out. He was great.<//Text></record>

Angela customer service informed me that the service will be available today and within an hour got a call back technician is on his way. Also an email by Tylor inform of arriving soon. He was prompt and kind. At short time service was complete.  He had time to fix the clogged drain in kitchen at short notice. Thank you for your service in the US military. Thank you for great service.</Review>

I called with a plumbing EMERGENCY. They showed up within 30 mins of calling and had it fixed within the hour. Best plumbing service yet!! The technician Abran and Mauro were respectful, professional and very good at information being explained to me. And came with a 30 day warranty 👍 Great job and I would definitely recommend and use them again!!<//Text>

Our first experience was with Jacob F and that went very well he didn’t pressure us on anything and with me that works. Jacob had another employee come over with the camera and at that point we could see the problem. The work had to be done and all went well. Two other employees came with the items needed to repair the pipeline and all went well. Thank you to all of you for your help and making it all go so well.< /Text>

<review>We suspected the clog drain was caused by the roots of the neighbor ‘s tree. Robert ran the snake through the drain and cleared the clog. He was skillful. It was efficient and effective. He suggested possible solutions and quoted the price prior the work. It was great! I would highly recommend his services to others.</review>< pics>

<Text>I made the appt on line late in the evening, requesting time frame of 8 AM to 12 PM.  They were here promptly at 8:05.  Cleaned the drain out 50 feet and very large charge for short time of work.  When questioned, stated that was the normal charge.  Call to head office stated they could give me a "senior discount".  When I questioned the repairman why that wasn't offered, he stated that he would have had to call the office to get approval.    He also stated that my statement would be posted via email with a 6 month warranty.  I have not received that email yet 3 days later.< /Text></record>

I had a 3 different people come by my house to do something.  The first one was on time and did a good job. Then I had a scheduled appointment for someone to come and no one came and I had to call to find out they rescheduled.  The next day someone came and just to tell me that someone else needed to come. Finally the right person came late in the day did what they had to do. I had another scheduled appointment to have someone come to check and evaluate my pipes and no one showed up. Very unhappy. Only the first guy came on time and and did what he needed to do. Still need an evaluation on my pipes.</Review>

Our technician was perfectly fine. He consulted with his superiors and tried to unclog some of our lawn drains. Unfortunately roots had grown through them anr they were blocked. He charged us $300 but did not accomplish anything. Unfortunately he blew two circuit breakers in the process.  One of the had to be replaced for an additional cost of $245. So it was $545 for nothing. I will not be calling you again.</Text>

Troy was very respectful, made us feel comfortable and did an amazing job explaining everything to us so we can understand what the problem was in our drains...Gave us a great recommendation on a product that we will be using to ensure we don't have similar problems in the future. Will definitely be recommending to our friends and family thank you!!< /review>

Brandon is just amazing, polite and professional, took his time to find the problem. On top of that, he was so patient with all the questions from my 8 year old boy who kept asking him all kind of questions. Roto-Rooter should be proud to have him. Roto-Rooter is a great company with great service, they honored the warranty without any question.</review>

Stephen came to clear clog(s) in my main pipe. He used a 150 ft snake in pouring rain. He was unable to clear it and told me I needed to PO call someone else; that "maybe they can do better than I did." He was very apologetic and seemed new and unsure of "drainage" pipe" clogs. He left, but forgot his shovel and the hand probe he used to locate the main pipe's cap. Please let him know and I will call you. Stephen was very polite, respectful, hard-working, and very sorry. Thank you for all you did and tried to do, Stephen.<//Text>

Service Technician was prompt and very responsible. Got the job done but it took the tech too long to fix the problem. Company charges $250 dollars an hour. The kitchen only needed the faucet replaced with new plumber lines. 1/2 hour job turned to a 2 hour job. I personally had to run for parts; at a nearby hardware store. I thought the company would provide parts unfortunately that was a “no”. Perfect place to call if you have an emergency when their is a water leak in the house.</Review>

Tylor was friendly and professional.  He wore a mask, shoe covers which I appreciate very much. He explained what he would do and gave me cost upfront.  He went to work right away and made the repairs. I will be calling when help is needed again. Although I hope it is not soon. 🙂< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>Jonathan arrived at our home shortly after I called.  He was very professional, he informed me of the policies and any guarantees that he might be able to leave me with.  Unfortunately because there were tree roots in our system the guarantee would not be available.  He suggested that we video our system to see where the roots and any damage might be in the system.  We were not able to pay for that at this point in time but he indicated that it would be available ay a later date if we decided to do this.  Jonathan was very polite and made sure that I was aware of the problem and he was helpful in getting the lock off our gate and replaced it when the service was completed.  I would definitely recommend Jonathan again and ask for him in the future if this type of service is needed.<//Text><Name>Sherry Wylie< /Name><date>1611862347639</date>< GmapID>

<review>I have a 4-plex and there was a clog backing up the bathrooms in two of the units. Brandon was dispatched and arrived quickly, knew what to do right away, cleared up the clog, and explained how to follow up with the city to get even better water flow.

Jacob was extremely professional and friendly and was able to identify the cause of our leak as well as another issue that might have caused trouble down the line. He explained everything thoroughly and was very patient in ensuring that we understood our options and the implications of all possible courses of action.

Jacob did not pressure us to do anything but empowered us to make the appropriate decision by providing plenty of information. He was timely, efficient and pleasant, and took care to be respectful of our concerns around covid. Thanks, neighbor! :)<//text>

The kid that was sent out was very professional courteous and very knowledgeable. Walked me through the whole process on work he'd be performing. Our whole system was clogged and he took care of the problem quickly and efficiently. Brandon F. Was great the kid needs a raise and if I have anymore plumbing issues I'd definitely want him dispatched.. thanks again roto rooter great job.<//Text>

< Review>
I just took the longest, best shower of my life. Jacob from Roto-rooter near Modesto and Manteca came to  my rescue when our bathroom began to back up. Toilet water in the tub. Sink water in the toilet. It was a nightmare come true and when everything seemed to be getting worse it definitely didn't stop. Jacob showed up quickly and immediately got to work. He was very nice and worked his butt off to diagnose our problem, which turned out to be 4 feet of roots invading out pipeline. He also pointed out we didn't have a cleanout to quickly fix the clog and future clogs. He worked his magic to get us all fixed up at a very reasonable price. Jacob did all the work himself in less time then I've seen a whole crew do. I have so much peace of mind now knowing exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. If you're looking for someone in the 209 area to fix your plumbing and not just bandage it up, I highly recommend Roto-rooter. Jacob, if you happen to read this someday, thank you so so very much.< /Review>

Jonathan did a great job unclogging my kitchen sink.  Answered all my questions and didn’t push me to pick one thing or another but left it to me.   He also talked to my son about entering the trade.  Always know job gets done well with this company unlike others that I’ve used in past and have made issue a bigger issue.<//Text>

<Text>I had an outdoor drain that wasn't carrying rain water away. Tylor showed up to water jet the line and found that I had a blockage. With a little assistance from Nickolas and his camera they were able to pinpoint the location of the blockage. Tylor made the repair in good time and I'm happy with the result. I appreciate the professionalism of both of these gentlemen and their willingness to make sure that I was given all available options.<//Text>< Pictures>

Would highly recommend if you are needing a professional and communicated company. I needed help with plumbing and septic service at my elderly fathers house. This company went above and beyond helping get his septic system fixed and communication was key to making this easy on myself. Phillip the plumber was a rock star and handled everything from the start to finish. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /text>

Those guys are professionals and extremely honest about what can and cannot be performed and if there is another way around to save money with it, like contacting the City or maybe different and cheaper service options they provide.
They saved me $13k and helped me to contact the City who will be installing the new pipes for me.
Thank you Alain and Mauro, you guys are AMAZING!< /Review>< Pics>

<Time>1605637745611</Time><rating>5< /rating><text>Robert Quindiagan arrived promptly and was friendly and knowledgeable throughout the whole process. He inspected my toilet and the leak and suggested multiple options (along with estimates) to deal with the issues present. I ultimately chose to have a new toilet installed as it was the best course of action in the long run.

Robert then left to get the new toilet and came back to install. The whole visit was about three hours from arrival and inspection to install and finish. I was impressed with how quickly Roto-Rooter responded to my request for service and even more impressed with how quickly said service was performed.

I’m very pleased with the job done and the price and absolutely recommend Robert and Roto-Rooter and will call on them for any future needs.< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Technician Christopher Robinson was very professional and used safety(mask) throughout his service. Explained what was wrong and what he was repairing/replacing. Our shower faucet had been leaking for the past two months and we thought it had something to do with the shower head but after it continued to leak after replacing it with the new one. We called in and Christopher fixed it within a hour. We are very thankful.</Review>

I called in the morning around 7a because we were having issues with draining in our home. Spoke to
Claudia, she set me up right away, within 2 hours I got a text stating that my plumber was on his way. The text provided me a tracker for their ETA and notified that our plumber John was on his way to help us. He was professional, explained everything thoroughly, and honest. I would highly recommend Roto-Rooters</Review>

Seems like Tech didn't want to help me at all.  Just throwing outrageous prices out so that I won't do the job.  Probably  wanted to go home because it was late afternoon Saturday.  He Was, going to charge me a little over $400 just to install my existing garbage disposal. First and last time with this company.<//Review>

They came out late last night and tried to do a simple snake process and found out it was a lot bigger deal so at 8am they brought out the heavy-duty equipment along with the camera and had it done within a few hours.. the workers worked very hard and we were very friendly and I would recommend them toanybody in need any type of Plumbing Service...thank you,
Mark Modean.

Two workers just came by and fixed an issue the last guys didn't do right...I don't know their names but they did a quick and efficient job...
Thank you,  Mark Modean</Text>

< Review>
Roto Rooters technicians not only failed to remove the duct tape from four out of the five roof vents after attempting a smoke test, but their toilet installer did not seal the new toilet he installed with a bead of caulk at the toilet's base after he installed it.  How amateurish and unprofessional!  Not holding my breath for satisfactory resolution.  They will probably ignore me now that they have the money I paid for unsatisfactory service.

The bathroom still smells of awful sewer odors at this time!  This is what they were called to resolve in the first place!

We are very disappointed with Roto Rooter.

Roto Rooter was only too happy to take our money for services that failed to resolve the original problem for which their services were retained.

Not happy.< /Review>

Roto Rooter Plumber quoted me $3,500 to clear a blockage just downstream of a clean out.  4" clay sewer main was 2.5' deep, only had to expose about 5' in unsurfaced dirt, no concrete or Asphalt to remove and restore.  Took me 2 hours to dig it myself and a couple more hours to get parts and make repairs.  Completely unreasonable, price gouged - borderline theft.  Roto Rooter should be ashamed of themselves!!</text>

<Text>I had a problem with the main sewer everything was backing up to the shower to the toilet to the sink and I have called alot of plumbers to come out and they told me I had to look for the clean out I have no idea where the clean out is coz the house is kinda old but the plumbers couldn't help me it took them days to come out so I called roto rooter spoke to Angela she got me a plumber within 1 hour Brandon came to the rescue he was very professional he already knew the problem and even knew where my clean out was where the other plumbers didn't even have no clue  Brandon did an amazing job and we found out what caused the clog it was disinfection wipes they don't dissolve at all and whats also good news they gave me a warranty for 6 months just in case something goes wrong the other plumbing services don't even give u that so I highly recommend Roto-rooter they r the best when it comes to ur plumbing needs specially ask for Brandon he gets the job done fast.< /Text>< GmapID>

Was given empty promises prior to signing the contract for the job of pipe switch outside rhe house , after contract was signed for the job all the parts that were promised to be done never happened. Nick made all these promises to convince me into agreeing to get the job started, don't let these empty promises happen to you.
1. Will be done with 2-3 days then after signing contract no crew available til next week.
2. Project manager Nick from Manteca area promised to stop by after job is complete perform a complementary camera view through the pipes to show it’s all performed correctly. Never happened didn’t check in During or after the job.
3. Was promised that the concrete hole on the drive way will be filled. Per nick “I promise we will fill the concrete hole on the drive way after the job is done even if I have to pull favors.” Never reached out after the job now I have a big hole on the drive way. Which was the reason I didn’t want the job performed at first.< /text>

<Text>Waited all day, showed up after dark, the only way to clear the main line was on the roof. I had told the office this, they assured me they could do it. When tec showed up he said they do not  get on roofs anymore.  I wasted a whole day waiting and still had clogged lines.< /Text>< Pictures>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>I am an apartment manager and I have dealt with so many different plumbing companies and this companies is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with. The plumber was scheduled for 8am amd didnt come until 4pm. And then was there for 2 hours and didnt fix anything and actually made the issue worse and instead of fixing the job because they are supposedly 24 hours he left for the day because his shift was over and didn't  turn the tenants water back on and they have a newborn baby with NO WATER in their unit . I called their customer service multiple times to have this figured out and they are so unprofessional and didnt send anyone back out to at least fix the tenants water amd told me they would call me back each time I called amd no one ever called back.  Never have I experienced such unprofessional and such unskilled service from any company. Warning. Their reviews are fake and do not trust this company.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

He didn’t even open the faucet to see if it just needed to be repaired. Literally looked at it and said, “it needs to be replaced.” Told us an obscene cost.< /Review>
