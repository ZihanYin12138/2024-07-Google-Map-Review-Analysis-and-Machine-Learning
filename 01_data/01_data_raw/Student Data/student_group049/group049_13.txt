<review>came last night for dinner, when we asked for takeout boxes there was 1 roach on each of the 2 boxes and when two others freaked out about it, the staff ignored us and pretended like nothing was happening.Not an offer to replace the boxes, not even a simple sorry! Even when we brought it up to them they acted like they didnt hear us scream "there's a bug!!" and got "oh really?" as a reply, I usually love this place and the food is always great, service is usually great as well. I also do not write reviews often but things like this needs to be addressed in a place of food, i would be caught dead if i did this at work, so next time please attend to your guests when there is an issue :)<//review>< rating>

The food was delicious when we finally received it.
.
My only complaint is that 4 at our table received their food and were almost finished as well as a table of 8 that came in after us before my husband and I received our food.</Review>

First they start you off with a mixture of regular Tortilla chips  homemade Flour chips along with an amazing Bean dip covered with salsa Verde, mozzarella, and Queso Mexicano! My wife always switches from her camarones limonadas or shrimp Cocktail. I always enjoy my Pollo Con Crema which is the best I ever tried in my opinion of course! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the customer service and waitress. It's honestly a hit and miss. Aside from that Villas delicious food makes up for a horrible waitress(not all the time)!</Text><user_name>Aaron Barron<//user_name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNApGmI_IzDAEJraevpa8ii0l0D3q4s2PuYJt31=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3pRG8AcakAIpMMTU8DWgPTXQRB1k6xKDy8FdT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><user>111054388604660489204</user>< rating>

My parents love eating at Villa's so we decided to meet family for a meal. We sat for 1 hour watching families that came in after us get their food eat and leave before our meal arrived one plate at a time! My uncle & aunt split a fajita plate and when the sizzling plate arrived the waitress just left without leaving plates for them to share the fajita plate. My auntie started to eat her fajita over a small napkin my dad had to call the waitress over and ask for 2 plates. When she brought the plates she didn't apologize just set the plates down and walked away. The meal after all that had decent taste and was prepared well. Oh I never did get the coffee I ordered after I was told they would brew it fresh!</text></record></dataset><record>

Great food every time I've been here. Sometimes the service is a bit slow with things such as refills, but it's understandable.  Everyone is very nice.</Text>

Nice little place for Mexican food. I especially like the bean dip that comes with the salsa and chips. I usually get an ala carte sope, which is big enough for a meal. This time I got the fish tacos, spicy lime. It was good and had a good kick. They are packed at lunch, so it's hard to get in and out within an hour, so I recommend to call in your order.< /review>

We drove from Denair the other day and were a little disappointed.  What we loved and still found is good quality food and especially the fried flour chips and bean dip that comes to your table right away.
The negatives: several dirty tables, none cleaned properly, that remaine uncleaned throughout our stay and the floor needed sweeping badly.  The waitress was nice and got our order right away but had to be chased d\own for beer order, more chips, the bill, etc.  When another waitress came in it got worse, she was applying makeup at the counter and the original waitress started talking about her homelife dramas.  I had to interrupt to pay the bill!<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Hands down the best pizza in Alameda with the best owners! And you can't go wrong with their beef pepperoni for those who are also looking for alternatives to pork.</review>

I DID NOT TRY THE PIZZA!!
The chicken parm was...well it was gross. I couldn't finish it. There was no breading on the chicken, it was little chewy pieces covered in a pink sauce. I also got wings. Which looked and tasted exactly like costco wings. Not saying they are Costco wings. I'm just saying they taste and look the same<//text>

Always Friendly Staff. Always!!! This place has never let me down. I normally only get slices of pizza but I'm sure the rest of the food is good too. They have a happy hour every day from 4 to 6 I think where you can pizza and beer for only $6.50. I walk here about once a week because I love the pizza. Definitely recommend.</review>

Alameda Pizza is excellent. Yes, the crust is thin, but the toppings and tomato sauce is outstanding. Plus, you get a lot of quality toppings. The sausage is especially good. I buy a pizza from them around once a month and have it delivered. I've never had a problem and the pizza is always hot.< /Review>

Pizza is decent, nothing special. Had an awful interaction with the owner not accepting a credit payment (racially motivated in my opinion). Also, I sat outside for 5 minutes and saw how filthy the alley next to it was. Wont go into detaiI. I will never give this place my business again.<//text>

I was going to get this place 3 stars because it didn't give me food poisoning, was pizza, and was reasonably tasty, but it turns out that I spent $80 on two pizzas and a chicken. Apparently, they recently updated their menu and increased their prices significantly and didn't bother to tell me when I ordered. To be fair, this was my fault for not asking when I ordered but, it would have been nice to know. The pizza itself was so - so. The sauce is kind of vinegary and a little bit sweet and the toppings slide easily off the pizza. The crust was actually very good, the delivery was timely, but in general I will not be eating here again.</text>

Promised delivery in 45 minutes. An hour and a half later they wouldn't answer the phone so we just drove there. Apparently they we're "just about to leave." At least we got our pizza.... eventually... and without delivery.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Been going here for about 18 years. Always consistent, good pizza and very friendly staff. It's a mom and pop joint and the owners really care about their customers. I always specifically order their thin crust which is a pretty decent facsimile of a NY pizza. It's not John's of Bleeker Street but still solid for a West coast pizza. We usually order cheese or pepperoni but a favorite which I believe is not on the menu is the Margherita. They also do slices.<//text>< pics>

Went to alameda pizza last night and ordered a deep dish - it was fantastically cheesy and cooked to perfection.  Two slices was all I could handle - excellent pizza and awesome service<//Text>

<review>Not on time... I was told 50-55 minute to deliver but this is the third time of being late... I've lived in Alameda for over ten years now and this is the pizza place I usually call because they deliver tasty raviolis... My kids eat the pizza and I'd say its been good. . But over the past three times I've ordered, the delivery is near a hour and a half wait. Never received a discount. The pizza crust is soaked with oil... No crunchy crust just chewy. Vthe raviolis looked like they where sitting under heat way too long.... I need to find another good pizza joint that delivers good pasta.... I'm not ordering from this place anymore.. I wish LaVals delivered pasta!!! I would call them all the time! But I only call them if I'm ordering pizza for my kids, I love there chicken garlic pizza but I enjoy pasta much more.... :-( if any one can recommend a spot that delivers good pasta or raviolis PLEASE let me know.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

We and several members of our family have been taking our ranch vehicles and personal vehicles here for services,  repairs and other maintenance needs for many years.  They are honest,  knowledgeable and highly qualified mechanics we recommend. A most important thing also is I trust them with my car. Their rates are very good.</Text>

<review>I took my car here a couple weeks ago because my car had a oil leak. They did fix my oil leak when I had it checked up the first time. But after a week and a half, on 5/19/20 I called G Street Auto Care to have them check on my car again because my car was flashing the oil check engine light (my oil check engine light had never flashed before until I took to have my car checked here the first time). I bought the car in around 1:30 PM and around 3:15 PM they called me and told me that my car was shaking really bad and it was making loud rattling noises. They had my car at the intersection of Kibby Road and South Bear Creek. They asked me if they should call roadside assistance or if I should call. Of course, I decided to call because my insurance would cover roadside assistance and I did not want to fork out money to have them tow my car back to my home. I did not appreciate how they took my car out there and yet did not have the decency to call roadside assistance and bring my car back to the shop instead. I waited at least 45 mins-1 hour for roadside assistance. Not cool that they drove it so far and I had to call roadside assistance. Yes, my car is broken and does not work anymore. I recommend not going here and rather you go somewhere else because I don't want this same thing to happen to anyone else.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I highly recommend this shop. We brought our vehicle in not knowing what was wrong and Anthony let us know they would take care of it and get it fixed. They are fast and dependable! The prices are hard to beat and their customer service is outstanding! We will definitely return in the future.< /text>

I called G Street Auto and took my Chevrolet HH in to have the AC repaired.
Tony, was very courteous and helpful and they repaired my AC
to work better than new. Also advised me how to get a new door lock control and reprogrammed it for $100.00 less than the Chevy dealer
I recommend then very highly< /Text>

I wanted to go here because of the reviews. I called just to ask if getting the check engine light code read was free because some places do it for free. The response I got was in a kind of rude tone and the guy said "oh no it's not free. Someone has to take the time to look up the code and figure out what it means." Before I could even ask how much it costs, I was hung up on. I was still planning on going to get it checked. I just wanted to know if it was free/ the cost.< /review>

Less than a year later, and just shy of 12,000 miles, which is what they warranty their work for-- one of the pulleys that they had replaced broke, throwing the timing belt, and subsequently destroying the engine.

Unfortunately, the shop I had the car towed to after this managed to throw away the old pulley and belt, despite me asking them specifically to save them because of the warranty issue.  G Street Auto said they couldn't do anything about it warranty wise, without seeing the broken components-- which I can understand-- but still, it pretty much sucked for me.  They were nice enough to take a look at the car and give me a second opinion about it (bent cylinder valves, same as the first place said), and didn't charge me for that.  But at the end of the day, my car was still destroyed, and it was probably due in some part to the work performed or the parts installed (DELCO), by these guys.

If I had been able to save the defective parts, maybe it would've been different.  They seem nice enough.  Hourly rate is a bit high ($85), but I always figured you get what you pay for.  Now I am not so sure.

Take your chances.<//text></record>

<Review>I always have a great experience here. I have had other places attempt to over charge me because I’m a women while thinking I don’t know what standard prices should be. However, Troy always provides exceptional service and reasonable pricing! I have definitely recommended this shop to friends & family. I came in last minute for an oil change and was in and out in a timely matter. Very friendly service as well.</Review><resp>None< /resp><name>Desirea Price< /name></record></dataset><record>

Everyone wants a mechanic that you can trust and this is the place.
We all have a budget, need to maintain our vehicles so we feel safe and they last..and of course we don’t want to be taken.
Troy checked my car and made recommendations of what needed to be fixed and what could wait for the future.
The service was excellent, timely and professional and fair pricing.
You will be in great hands if you go here and I guarantee it will surpass the ten mark on your rating scale!
Thank you Troy my car is running great!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>Main Auto Care is by far the most honest and reliable place I have ever taken my vehicles. Troy is honest and always delivers what he says he will deliver. Finding an honest auto shop is one of the greatest things in life.  I feel like I’ve found mine.
Thank you Troy and Main Auto Care.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I’ve known Troy for 8 years. He’s always been a reliable place for my oil changes, brake jobs, tuneups and other minor works. There is a reason he has so many 5 star reviews. Reading through the reviews, the words you read over and over are “honest mechanic”, and “trustworthy”, and they come as no surprise. But it’s not just that. He is highly skilled, very quick, and impeccable with his work. One time, I had a burnt blinker bulb in rear left side of my truck. I got so much grief from cars behind me because the blinker wasn’t working. I even tried to replace it myself and couldn’t get to the bulb. I was really busy with work and couldn’t find the time to take the truck in, so this went on for several weeks. On my next oil change, after he did the job, I ask Troy if he had time to take a look at the blinker. He gladly agreed (even though he was busy) and in less than 5 minutes, he changed the bulb. I was shocked. When I asked him how much, he replied $10 !!!! Say What?? I would have gladly paid $50. I was so elated. I highly recommend Troy to my friends & family. From Oil Change and Tuneups to complete engine replacement, if your car needs repairs, take it to Main Auto Care. You’ll be glad you did.</Text>

First time here - dropped car off in the morning for routine  maintenance. Car was ready early afternoon, friendly counter employee, liked that they were also less expensive than the last shop I went to, and they accept my Synchrony cc. Car sounds/feels good, no issues after a week from visiting them. Will definitely come back.<//Text>

Troy is in an honest mechanic and he will do everything he can to get your car done quickly and make you feel comfortable about it. Best prices on oil change anywhere. oil changes are less than $20 too. (For regular motor oil)< /Review>

Troy always delivers. Detail oriented and very communicative. He’ll tell you what’s going on with your car and walk you through every step. Whether you drop your car off or wait, it will be quicker than you think. Quality work from quality people, pleasantly transparent. I’ve been bringing my cars here for a decade. 10 out of 10 would HIGHLY recommend.</text>

<text>Love going here! I have two cars that I take here all the time. I purchase new tires, get an alignment, & an oil change. Everyone here is super friendly, Jose & Carlos always take good care of me. If something isn't right, they recommend whatever it is I need. Been going here for over 5 years & I don't think I'll go anywhere else.<//text>< Pictures>

Main auto care did some major work on my moms ford turaus . Price was steep but as I said there was some major work that was done . In the end I'm sure it was cheaper than going out and buying another one . Car is running great so far . It's a little noisier than when I took it in . So for now thanks main auto care.</review>

<Text>I've always been hesitant when going to an auto repair shop. I'm a woman and I've heard stories from friends that they've been ripped off. Well that wasn't the case for me. Troy was beyond professional and very honest on the work I needed for my car. I was in and out in a little less than an hour. My car is running fantastic.<//Text>< pics>

Good work Troy !
Got new tires at Costco, and then Main Auto did the alignment on our Volvo C30 T5.
Now the car runs and rolls smooth as glass, on the freeways and curves, at speeds higher than 65...
Before, between 55-60 and up, it would bounce and vibrate noticeably.
Thanks again Main Auto.<//review>

I appreciate constant communication about my car. There is never anything done to my car that hasn’t been discussed with me first. The work done is always accurate and I’m not having to go back in 2 days needing it looked at it again. I have recommended this auto shop to many people and I will also recommend it to anyone reading this.< /Text>

<Review>This is a awesome Auto shop. Honest employes willing to help and go above and beyond for their customers. They diagnosed my moms car quickly .. and affordably sand behind their work and products. Quick to respond and updated with quote and best adorable way to get the car fixed. No one wants to deal with car repairs especially when you always feel some way you are going to be ripped off. I have no doubt that I am getting a reasonable price and am taken care of here. Would I recommend ...yes definitely. This is my go to place!

Troy is absolutely awesome!< /Review>< Response>

Troy has a much better price than a local competitor 😉, he had the work done in plenty of time, earlier than he had promised 😉!! My new debit card was giving me fits and he was very patient with me and compassionate 🤗
I will definitely return 🤗!!

Was there for LOF on my 2018 Ford Fusion. The dealer said i had to leave my car and come back 4 to 5 hrs later. I came to Main Auto and i got my car serviced in less than one hour, and for half the price of the dealer's.
Great service. The owner/manager was very friendly and curteous. Highly recommend it.</text>

Troy is very friendly and seems pretty knowledgeable. He has always explained to me services done and why. Whenever I have come here I don't feel the shop is trying to sell me more services than I need.

At other shops I have experienced being shamed when I can't do a service right there and then (due to financial reasons). -I am happy to say I have never experienced this here and will keep coming here.< /text><rate>5< /rate>< Gmap_id>

<review>Nothing but great things to say about main auto care. Troy really took care of me with his great customer service. Very knowledgeable and provides most services needed for your vehicle. He and his guys repaired engine oil leaks as well as axle fluid leaks on my Jeep Wrangler and now it's running better than ever. Thanks again Troy! I'll definitely be back.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dcd9d7522fcf8b:0x8c4ba615bcfef782<//GmapID></record>

I was very impressed with not only the professionalism but the honesty of this companies employee. I called because I needed a whole new key and fob for a Nissan. First they arrived ahead of schedule, second it was discovered that when the car was towed the key fell on the side of the seat. The tech noticed this at the time he was making a copy and pointed that out. Normally I would have had a 2nd key made but with times the way they are money’s tight. So because of the techs professionalism and honesty the $200 bill became $75. I’ve already recommended 2 people and I will continue to do so with anyone that can use their services. Thanks again and I will definitely call if I need you again, you have a customer for life.<//Review>

Said he wouldn’t be able to make a key for the club. It’s alright. I told him I didn’t care about a key I just want the club off my car. He put my cover back on and was polite, kind, and took care of me quickly. Being alone at midnight , he made me feel not to be scared. An excellent team member for AAA, thank you. This is the very reason I have AAA for myself and my daughter.
Thank you for great service at a time when I really needed your help.

If you need a reliable local locksmith, I cannot recommend The Key Crew enough. We woke up Sunday to find someone tried to steal our Ford F-150. We immediately called The Key Crew Locksmith and Nate was here in 15 minutes.  While he was working on our lock he gave us a free jump to make sure our battery was fully charged.

Unfortunately, the thief’s did so much damage to the ignition, the part they needed, Ford no longer makes.  So instead of saying, nope we can’t do the job they went above and beyond.  They researched on Ebay and junkyards to get us the best price.  As soon as the part came, Tim, one of the owners, personally came out to fix it. They had us up and going in no time.  Trust the Key Crew to take care of all your locksmith needs.<//text>

They did great job and better. Used them twice. Very professional. First time the guy is pro. Second time the guy was in training from first. Hard job and nailed it. Both times was told no charge. I won’t need any other company in the future. Down to earth pros.< /Text>

Peter came quickly and was fun to chat to despite the circumstances. He was able to open and repair the deadbolt quickly without any drilling. He demonstrated great familiarity with his craft. I am super satisfied. If I ever have lock problems, I'll call Peter first thing.<//review>

<review>Michael's the man! Michael was able to successfully duplicate a spare motorcycle key for me using a OEM microchipped blank (which I bought and brought in from the dealership)! He even made sure that the newly cut key was mechanically functioning on my bike before he charged my credit card! Michael was very professional and efficient - highly recommend The Key Crew off Admas Ave!</review>< Pictures>

After 32 years of driving the same car, yesterday when trying to start my 1989 Ford Mustang convertible  I couldn’t get the ignition switch to budge!
I called AAA and after a few suggestions of theirs it still would give so they said they’d  dispatch a lock specialist.
I was told the arrival time may be lengthy but it was not bad at all...he met me at my car in under a half hour.
Nate was the technician who came out and he was wonderful.
My switch was a bit of pain in the butt trying to remove and it did he say It was taking  longer than most ignition switch repairs but I had a book and didn’t mind the wait.
He installed the new switch and gave me the new key and I was safely on my way home.
I highly recommend Nate.
He knows what he’s doing and he’s polite and followed all the Covid safety protocol as well.< /Text>

<review>This is the 2nd time I had to use this service. The first time I had an emergency and missed my appointment at the hospital because no one showed up for 4 hours. This time no one ever showed up at all because they said they were trying to  call but I told the dispatcher that I had no phone so they  never showed up. Is this the way you treat your premier member?not once but twice. What do I pay you for.</review>< name>

I was recently on a date with my wife and when we got back to our house we realized we both left the keys in the house and locked ourselves out. This was a really annoying way to end the night but Alex was able to make it a quick and easy process.
We found The Key Crew Locksmith on google , and Alex came out to our house in Union Square within 15 minutes. He is extremely professional and knowledgeable. He got us back into the house in minutes!

I was searching for anyplace or machine to make copies of an odd key of mine. It was exhausting.. Until I contacted this place. I contacted them in the morning and by early afternoon I had the copies I needed. They went above and beyond in getting the blanks needed. Charged me a fantastic price. We're knowledgeable, friendly, professional and very quick. I couldn't have asked for a better expierence. Would recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>

<Text>In a time of frustration after 2 tows, multiple shops looking to eye gouge for the exact same service of rekeying, I am so glad I kept calling around!
I came across The Key Crew who quickly put me at ease, they were professional and informative from the very first phone call!.

The were effective with leaving notes for the next person, they were auperbquick in dispatching, they were organized with communication between the team and the guy that camenout "Tim" went above and beyond!

Time really made me feel taken care of, the cost was super reasonable, he explained everything and did everything he could to get me back on the road!

I am very lucky to have found them! As a girl in need, they really took care of me and made me feel independent that I didn't need to count on anyone else but them! From begining to end! This was definitely the crew for me!

Thank you for all you do !
It may seem like something so simple but for someone like me, it was everything!<//Text>< Rate>

Great service.  In and out.  Installed a new battery in my car fob.  Have used before at their old location.  There is a small parking lot in back or street parking.  There is a reasonable mobile locksmith service that will rekey your house locks, install new locks, or provide other services such as if you lock the keys in your car.  Highly recommend.</Review>

After loosing my keys with the key fob, I couldn't turn on my car with my spare. I called The Key Crew Locksmith to find out if they can provide a key fob. Instead they guided us step by step how to enable my car so I can turn it on! This guy was amazing :) we were so happy especially it being after hours and the customer service was beyond our expectations!<//Text>

These folks were overly gracious with their time and energy and resources... Fully patient, compentent, kind, and made themselves readily available... even when the T-Mobile Metro PCS service went down and they couldn't reach me by phone they hung out until we crossed paths at my service address... this team has your best interests at heart! Outstanding correspondence and customer service...plus AAA discount!! Thanks for everything Key Crew!< /review>

Wow! I lost one of my Toyota car fob/keys and the dealership quoted me a crazy high price. I found the The Key Crew on google and their website is sleek and easy to use. With a quick phone call I was quoted half the price of the dealership. A few days later I showed up and they pulled up my quote and had me in and out of their in less than 10 min. Really friendly staff and half the price of the dealership. Fob/key works as good as the original.< /text>

<Text>The Key Crew is great. They came to my car within four hours of the call, and cut a key for my car, which is an obscure older car and I thought they were going to have trouble getting it done. They took about 30 minutes and had two sets of perfect keys ready for me and the cost was about a third of what I thought it was going to be. If you’re needing any help with keys these guys are who you should call.<//Text><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

After 9 years I apparently "lost" my car keys for my 89 Nissan... Well it was a cold rainy day and after calling multiple "24 hour" companies and being told "it's too dark" or "wait for the weather to clear up", I called the key crew. They came immediately, made a key on the spot very fast, and did an amazing job.  10/10 would recommend over any "24 hour mobile" locksmith in San Diego.<//Text>

Tim and Michael helped me out tremendously after someone broke into my vehicle and destroyed my ignition. Tim troubleshot the new ignition I bought, and re-keyed it very quickly. And their friendly attitude was exactly what I needed after all the stress of the break-in. I was recommended The Key Crew by AAA.</review>

<review>These guys are AWESOME!!!  They rebuilt the ignition cylinder and then helped me put the ignition back together. I called EVERY lock smith in SD and these guys not only knew what I was looking for, but we're extremely confident in their ability to fix it. I would recommend them to anyone. Don't go to a shack in a parking lot, go to these guys!</review></record>

Do not use for residential! Worst experience with any business ever! Instead of fixing the lock correctly the first time I had to have multiple techs come out and was even told by someone  that “ I must have gotten the new guy” !? Not to mention getting locked inside my house! After three techs trying to fix the problem I finally got to talk to a supervisor who told me it would cost me an extra $200 to fix what I asked them to do the first time!</text>
<Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1567536557544, 'text': 'Shavonne, you called us out to make a key for a lever lock that ultimately required drilling, not to replace any hardware. Because you are moving, you opted for the least expensive option, and we replaced the cylinder at no additional charge. Admittedly, we should have quoted to change all of the hardware from the beginning. We also sent 2 other techs when you were "locked in" which was really from your having stuffed paper into the latch hole. The quote for $198.49 still stands to replace the hardware. You will need to call to reactivate the service.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x80d9545386d0c779:0x57d17abb5ab5f4ca</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The Key Crew was amazing. They were able to program my car key when the dealership couldn't and wanted over $1000 to replace parts. Cost me less than 1/10 of what I would have had to pay. These guys are awesome.</Review>

<Review>Just went in today 8/8/18 to have a spare key made for my car. They were quick, the key works great, and they were about $125 cheaper than the dealership. No complaints over here!</Review>< Pics>

<text>I came to this shop twice . There was only one person there who was very nice but became overwhelmed with customers. What made me so upset was my situation was difficult they could not program my car key. When  the owner TIM was called he seemed to not be concerned or consider that I had made 2 trips here only to get interrupted service. Instead of sending help for this guy he just allow my service to suffer. My rating is poor customer service. I came all the way from Temecula because of a referral what a disappointment.<//text><rating>1< /rating>< pictures>

<review>As we've all experienced at some point, my key would't turn over the ignition in my car.. VERY Frustrating. I called AAA (TripleA), and they dispatched the Key Crew for the repair.  Nate was the specialist who showed up and he did a great job!  Very friendly and professional.  Really appreciated them and got the car back up and running again.  Thanks!<//review>< pictures>

I went to ACE hardware's locksmith for a very difficult job--merging my car's new ignition key with the old door key.  Ace told me it was against policy
I went to a local locksmith.  They told me it was impossible.
The key crew did it in 10 minutes.  These guys know what they're doing.  They're professionals.  5/5, 100% two thumbs up.  All superlatives.  Go nowhere else.</text>

<Text>Ok i admit it. I made a mistake. Went surfing and had the Toyota key in a waterproof pouch in the pocket of my baggies. The wave action was considerable and guess what? The waterproof pouch and the key somehow floated out! Little chance of finding the items.  A passerby was kind enough to lend me his cel phone. I called AAA. They called The Key Crew. Chris showed up. Talk about professional and experienced. I was amazed by the complexity of the job to create and program an entirely new key. Chris did it like drinking water. Easily. Worth every dollar. Would not hesitate to recommend Chris and the Key Crew again.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1535676584973, 'text': 'Thank you!'}< /Response><gmapID>0x80d9545386d0c779:0x57d17abb5ab5f4ca<//gmapID></record>

HANDS DOWN the best locksmith in San Diego! I had locked the keys to my BMW 128 in the trunk. Not only did they unlock the cab of the car in about 20 seconds they had my trunk open in 2 minutes!!! Another locksmith told me their guy would have to take out my rear seat!  (Cost $400) Instead I paid $00 (thanks to AAA). These guys contract with AAA and it’s easy to see why

I COULD NOT BE MORE IMPRESSED!!</review>

< review>
This is by far the most professional and friendly locksmith business I have every patronized! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
When I had initially called in to see if they were able to cut an automotive key for my honda, Ruben was incredibly polite and patient on the phone and in person. Being a sceptical after several calls to other businesses, I am sure I sounded exhausted and defeated. I had called three other places explaining my situation and all other competitors audibly laughed and said no.
When I arrived at their brick and mortar, I was pleasantly surprised to see a professional and well stocked interior and was greeted immediately!
I mentioned that I had just called about my honda key, and Ruben immediately took the initiative to offer relocating the rfid transponder the the new casing at no additional charge. Talk about going above and beyond! When I had mentioned that the battery may also be depleted in the remote, he voiced that he absolutely had the replacement in stock! The frugal natured person that I am was shocked when the replacement battery was priced exactly what I'd pay on amazon for it, and they even replaced the old one.
All in all, I was amazed at the quality of service I received, and will be returning for all of my replacement key needs!
Thank you Team!<//review>

Thank you for your HONESTY, Key Crew Locksmith! Your technician saved me $300 from a Toyota San Diego service scam. My Prius remote key only needed a replacement battery as opposed to a new remote key and reprogramming like Toyota San Diego claimed. I will recommend your place to everyone!</review>

Do not come here.
Overpriced and they rob you of your money.
Everything they do is extra.

<Review>Got a new car key made today. NOT for the $300 I was quoted by AAA, After I used my premier benefits, but for much much less. They replaced the plastic casing, transferred the transponder and made me a new key using a laser, for $38 with a $2 discount for using my AAA card!!!! Their prices are extremely competitive..I adore Daniel and Michael of The Key Crew!!! Straight up Professionals....</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Disappointed.  I called up to get a quote for duplicating my plain metal car key.  No chip or anything.  The lady on the phone was very nice and looked up my car to see if they could handle it.  They could, but the key is a "security key" and requires special skills to cut and costs more as a result.  More than the dealership!  I smelled a scam and took my business elsewhere.  An Irish sounding place to the Southwest of this place did the job in 2 minutes for %10 the price.  Trust and honesty are essential parts of good business and I would think this definitely applies to the lock business as well.  Take you work across town for fair treatment.< /Text>< user_id>

These guys are the REAL DEAL.  I called in a bit of a bind, locked out of my car just as I needed to be loading up and checking out of my AirBnB. The tech showed up in about 10 minutes and had the door open in about 10 seconds.  I was worried because a few years ago I had to have a different locksmith let me in and they shattered my car window in the process after a very long struggle.  The tech John was quick, friendly and professional!  Would DEFINITELY recommend to ANYONE.  Just wish I needed locksmiths more so I could give these guys more business.  It's hard to find good help these days - but NOT with the Key Crew.< /review>

I came home to my apartment and my key wouldn’t work. It’s Christmas Eve and out of 15 different lock smith company’s this was the only one to answer my call. John showed up to my place in less than 20 minutes and was able to open my door in less than 10 minutes. I can’t say enough about the service and how John was willing to help me on Christmas Eve at 1030 at night. Thanks John!!<//review>

<Text>Took a key to be duplicated and they messed it up. The guy at the counter was nice and all but after he messed it up he said something about the effect that it was my fault. I handed them one branded key and one "generic" key that were obviously NOT identical. He only noticed and said something after he had already started making the cuts but blamed me for not informing them that they weren't the same style keys. It's upsetting because my dealer offered me a free blank which was ruined but now i have to special order one at $50 which is really inconvenient. To top it off I was blamed for their mistake, how is it my fault that they lined up the keys incorrectly? I'm not a key cutter or a key expert. I needed keys to be duplicated and that's it. I'm pretty sure it was an honest mistake but as a business taking responsibility for you mistakes is important.<//Text>< pictures>

Excellent pricing fast service friendly staff and now my new place to get keys made

Their stock is plentiful and the quality of their products is top notch

I have gotten keys made at my other favorite location but when I had a key done here big difference in product quality

Also they can program a brand new key that you otherwise can't do unless you go through the dealer and their rates are half that of dealer programing

Yes they have key blanks however if you get a key made at the dealer and make certain that its made right these guys can program the key and get you out the door faster than going through the dealership

Over all very satisfied

And left there as one happy customer!<//review>

We were doing a remodel/addition to our home and needed all new base molding: 280 linear feet.  I spent one hour at HD looking at all the options and pricing and left frustrated.

Hubby said to go to Builders Molding Supply before I came home because our uncle had recommended them for doors.

I walked inside and instantly was welcomed, was asked all the pertinent questions about my project and shown some initial options.  I showed him a picture of the door casings and gave him an idea of the look we wanted.  He suggested a 3.5" molding and gave me a price that made my eyes bug out in a good way!  It was $2 less than the molding I was considering at HD!  I asked if he had enough in stock (eighteen pieces of 16' lengths) and he assured he did.  I paid for it and sent hubby to pick up within 30 minutes.

The whole process from when I walked in to when I walked out took maybe 15 minutes.  All the guys were friendly and professional.  I noticed they had doors, drawer pulls and other details for the home.  I won't ever try HD or the competition first ever again!<//Text>

Builder's Moulding Supply is the best place in San Diego to get moulding. Their prices are great, they have an EXPANSIVE showroom, and their employees are very knowledgeable and friendly. I've used them many times before and they are very consistently awesome.</text>

<Text>Please know they have a very strict and extremely short return policy and will not budge. Have spent thousands here and referred many friends and clients here, but that ends today.  Store staff would not return items still in perfect and original wrapping. Wouldnt even let me take a store credit to buy other things i needed. So you can keep my money but i will take my future business elsewhere.<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1482266005050, 'text': 'While we value all the business you have given and referred, there are some general time limits on returns.  Each and every receipt has the necessary information regarding how long we accept items for credit.  That amount of time tends to be between one and three weeks, depending on the item.  In your case, we were not able to return the items due to the time since purchase being multiple months.  We only carry a certain amount of stock for any given item.  Unfortunately, in your case, we had full stock and were not able to accommodate a return past the allotted time frame.\n\nWe are sorry to see you go, but remain hopeful that you will change your mind in the future.'}< /Response>

It’s truly a breath of fresh air anytime I need to conduct business with them. After many many years of working with them I still have the same relationship with the same people that I begin with!!

< Review>
It was easy enough to obtain this insurance. They got back to me pretty fast after completing the quote questionnaire. I was able to communicate with them over the phone, text and email. The only issue was in my case - they couldn't brake it down on payments and I had to pay the whole summary upfront for the year. Anyway it was cheaper then others.. Overall the experience was good!< /Review>

I was worried when I decided to no longer deal with local insurance agents and switched to USA Business Insurance.  I have been so impressed with every aspect of their service.  The rapid response from my COI requests is excellent.  If I didn't know any better, I would think that I was their only customer.  A 5 star business in my book!<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Although this company will write good policies, their practices on collecting payments are reprehensible! To put it simply, they are bullies.  Instead of sending a paper bill per request, they send emails that state "Cancellation" in big letters when in fact your policy is not being cancelled, it's simply their way of saying 'payment due'. During the pandemic, they REFUSED to even discuss disaster holds or policy credits, always referring to another line, where you wait on hold for 20 minutes and are then disconnected. They threatened to cancel my worker's comp policy 4 times, when in fact I'd been in conversations with the company carrying the policy over a period of months and the policy is on a disaster hold!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1590524110291, 'text': 'The owner of this company Hillary Mosher is very unprofessional and unethical person.

<Review>I was searching for a insurance for a firearm store. This company came up as a leading provider of insurance for that type of insurance. The web site information page pre-filled most of the firearm information. After filling out the online questionnaire which and they collected all of my personal and business information the agent thanked me and said we do not sell that insurance to that type of business. GREAT now that they have my email and phone let the SPAM calls begin. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR INFORMATION.< /Review>< pictures>

Shopping for insurance rates can be quite a headache. Zack was the representative that  assisted me in obtaining insurance for my new business. I had spoken to a couple of different companies but Zack truly gave me the best price and guided me to pick the plan that best works for me. He was very very patient in explaining the details of the various plans, very knowledgeable and he was really responsive with returning my phone calls and emails. I highly recommend USA Business Insurance Services to everyone.<//review>

Beware false reviews. I tried working with this company, and the agent I dealt with must have been given a job by his parents--no understanding of the insurance industry, gave me the run around for two weeks, and "charged" my credit card for their time.

Went with another company which pushed things through in a matter of hours.< /Review>

<Review>Couldn't even get past Zach's attitude when I called. He couldn't start the call with more than a "Hello?" No identification of who he was or anything. His questions were abrupt and rude. Call ended up lasting about 2 minutes or less because of his poor customer service.

I suspect other reviewers are either himself or friends, because he had NO customer service skills.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I am so happy I went with USA Business Insurance to insure my tattoo Studio. Sam was wonderful! He gave me just what I needed, and didn't try to sell me on tons of other coverages that I cover myself through a legal consent form that clients sign before they get their tattoo. I spent 2 weeks going through companies who were giving me outrageous quotes, so save your time and just go to USA Business Insurance, especially if you run a specialty business. Thank you Sam!

Zack from USA Business Insurance Services was able to save me several thousand dollars on a general liability policy for my business that provides water purification systems.  He was very professional, straightforward, and easy to work with.  I will recommend this company to other business people.< /Review>

Best tire shop in California!! I've been coming here for several years and now my sons go there too. I've recommended several satisfied customers. They are professional, courteous and very efficient. Prices are very affordable and they always give the best customer service. On one occasion I needed an emergency tire replacement but I forgot my wallet and Luis was like don't worry about just go run your errands and stop by later to pay him. That was hands down very professional and trustworthy. I highly recommend this Tire Repair shop 😊👍 I'm a loyal customer for Life!👌</review>

<Text>🚗The guys are always very sweet to my family. They are honest and help you with what they can offer. I've been going there maybe over 8 years or so. It's a small place so if they are packed be patient that's how good they are. It's hard to find a honest place who doesnt screw you for what you can barely bring home from work.  That's why I recommend this place.Thank you for always helping  our family 🙏👍❤🚙</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Called Petes tires on a whim. Needed a spare tire and rim for my 2014 hyundai elantra. Was at walmart, so i called and asked if this & that.
So drove over right away, and Pete couldnt have been more spot on. Found a rim that fit my auto and a used tire. All good things. Would tell anyone, who needed yes go.< /text>

I had two flat tires and in need for some so I shopped around . See I was only working with $80 and the other places wanted 60 and  50 for 1 tire but when I shopped at Petes tires and they worked with what had that's why I liked it.< /Text>

Petes Tires picked up 64 carcasses from us to purchase for recapping. they checked them out and said that only some of them were recappable and they would pay us for those.
their salesman Rick informed us we had a credit coming. after waiting over a year we sent them a letter asking for the the payment.  I got a call from their office saying the cost of disposal equaled out with the value of the tires and they didn't owe us anything.
don't think I will sell them anymore carcasses.

< Review>
My husband recently bought a car from Hawthorne Express Motors and his experience was absolutely great! The Office Manager Vicky was so helpful and kept her word which said a lot about her character. Not too mention the car being in great condition and a great price! Thank you for excellent service!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I bought my Lexus Gs350 from Hawthorne Motors Express and absolutely love it!
I’ve never bought/thought about buying from a “Used Car Lot” but they really do have quite a selection for everyone’s needs. My Lexus was parked next to a BMW, and Maserati with the passenger/eco friendly cars right across the lot.

Their facilities are clean, with an extremely friendly personable family running the show. I spoke with Tarren on the phone and he was super helpful with the details and information I wanted to know about the car before heading to the dealership to see it visually. Tarren was not at all pushy (like most salesman at the big dealerships) understanding I do have a life and at any point I was ready to come take a look at the car to come on in and they would make sure they took care of me. He made the experience simple and easy to visually see the car and test drive.

Vicky is the mother/wife who was a sweet heart from the start. I came into the dealership with my auto loan ready to go. She made sure to take care of all the paperwork while making sure she explained everything throughly even going back to correct “internet pricing”. I found the car through USAA and they applied a discount she scrapped the previous paperwork without any hesitation, corrected her numbers and didn’t try to hide ANYTHING. She gave me my own copy, circled and underlined broke it down. I believe she truly cares about the experience and making sure things are done accurately and correctly without any shortcuts.

I came back the day after sleeping on the car idea running numbers and this is when I met Sara.

Sara is the daughter of Vicky.

You could say Sara is Vickys TWIN.

They both got good looks and great personalities to match!

I walked in was greeted by Sara she immediately knew who I was,  offered a beverage, conversed effortlessly all while gathering my paperwork to finalize the sale. I’ve bought cars from big dealerships and I think this explains the “Express” that 4-5 hours it takes at a BIG dealership.. you know, to sign the papers and get everything done and ready? Yeah. It took 45minutes. If that.

Sara had my back story knowing all my information before I had spoken a word to her. She went through explaining throughly and confidently what paperwork was what, and any question or concern I had simply explaining it without being rude or having an attitude. She made sure I was comfortable with everything giving me the option to check out the car again, sending Terran to make sure car was good to go. She stressed if there was anything I needed to not hesitate to call them anything at all.

“Hawthorne Motors Express” completely changed the way I look at small car lots. They took care of me a complete stranger to them. I believe they just want to see their clients happy. They have a big selection whatever you’re looking to get and I’m not at all surprised they have repeat clients, or are on a good banking Site like “USAA” (not any dealer is on that site.” I believe they deserve all the best that comes to them as that’s what they provide the best service.

“Don’t Judge a book by its cover.”

Thank you guys so much!!</Text>< pics>

<text>I can honestly say this was the best car buying experience I’ve ever had. Sara was the nicest and kind person I’ve ever met buying a car. The sale itself took 30 min and I was driving away in my new Mercedes. After taking my car home Sara followed up with me numerous time to see how I was enjoying the car.there usually is a stigma behind small dealerships, but not this one. It was 1st rate service from the moment I walked in. I will be friend my next car!<//text>< Rate>

Had a great experience they pulled out all the stops. living in the Sacramento area and buying a car online is always in easy but I called on a friday and by monday I was looking at flights to lax they even picked me up from the airport and had everything ready when it got there. I spent more time on the 405 driving out of town then I did getting the car. Would definitely recommend them and will be back when I decide to buy another car<//review>

< review>
Hawthorne Motors Express was an absolute pleasure to deal with. They made the process quick and easy. They are very flexible and will never try to pressure sell you. As a commercial real estate broker, I am not a fan of using emotion to sell and not once did they try to do that. I was looking at another car at South Bay Land Rover, which was a used Volvo S40. Not only were they unwilling to negotiate (the vehicle was priced about $700 above what they should have charged based on comparable vehicles I found at other dealers), but they attempted to constantly pressure me into signing paperwork, filling out a credit application, etc. They were also bombarding me with calls and emails. Other dealers (as well as South Bay Land Rover) also tried to sway me by asking me "to get in the car one more time" or "test drive it another time." Sorry, folks, but those tactics do not work on me.

I would also like to especially give recognition to Tarren and Sara for being very flexible with me. It took me over two weeks to finally decide on my 2008 MINI Cooper S Convertible after a couple of inspections and some negotiating.

I would highly recommend this dealership. This is by far the best experience I have had in buying a car.< /review>

<review>I usually don't write reviews but this dealership has definitely earned my respect. First off the car buying experience was great! I never got discouraged nor was I ever upset at any point. This is a family operated business if I'm not mistaken truthfully I felt like part of their family with this experience! I definitely would recommend this dealership regardless of which state you live in. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to had chosen such a wonderful dealership to purchase a perfect vehicle for my family I can trust!< /review></record>

Sara put forth the efforts to rectify my qualms,she arranged for Service of my SUV,to Rectify previous Recall issues,not addressed at purchase.The pricing coulda been more competitive off the bat,with these "unkown" recalls in mind,which were Minor.I'm not into haggling,& it did have lil dents.But for folks who Had not Established Much Credit,in 20 yrs.Im lucky to even have been financed,though,21 percent with CIG was a bit outlandish.They should work with at least 2-3 creditors,to achieve the best APR..Nice Selection of 60k n below,used vehicles.
I had a feeling something was up,when the Paper Plates said Expiration,June 2,2021, yet when I called for clarification,no return..I took it upon myself,to Physically Walk Into DMV & pay em,for Registration Renewal,4 months into my purchase.I was handed license plates from DMV.Now I here,who I assumed was their "Repo Guy",left a message on my VM,saying,I have Licence Plates & an extra key there,& whether I want em Mailed or I pick em up..Of course I want it mailed..n Sara claims they will Refund me, apparently,I was already Charged for DMV fees at Signing.Dont wait for 4 yrs to pay off yer car..Close it,in a Year.Like I'm really gonna have some GPS shtt put under my Ride..I already told these folks,I have 23 previous yrs Homeless,dealing with Unscrupulous types,(from Curb to Corporation.)Robin Hoodloom on YouTube & IG<//text>

Great Customer Service

I am from out of town and I received an incredible amount of support with all my questions and needs. I felt like Sara truly had my best interest and individual needs in mind. Every time I am in need of a car I will certainly make this my first stop even though I will have to drive three hours to get the the location, I am certainly a return customer!</text>

The team at Hawthorne Motors Express was wonderful. I can't recommend them highly enough. They are friendly, honest, helpful, proactive, and knowledgeable. This was about the best car-buying experience I could imagine, and they demonstrated the best of what I hope for and expect in an auto dealership.

I was in the market for a pre-owned SUV and had done about 20 hours of research before deciding on three possible models and a range of model years. They had exactly what I was looking for in terms of budget, mileage, vintage, maintenance records, and condition.

Terran was very friendly when I arrived, and took as much time as I needed to take a test drive, look over the car, answer my questions, and get me all the information I needed to help me decide. There was no pressure, and I felt that he genuinely wanted me to find the best car for my needs. Building a customer relationship was primary; making an immediate sale wasn't the priority.

Sara was proactive and positive while working with me on arranging the best financing terms. Hawthorne has excellent relationships with many lenders and she spent as much time as it took to get me very fair terms.

The purchase process was smooth, no pressure, transparent, and easy. But what really exceeded my expectations was how they handled an issue with the car that showed up about a week after I bought it. The car I bought was a few years old and had higher miles (over 100,000), and so was sold as-is without a warranty.

When I started experiencing transmission issues after purchase, I was disappointed but not surprised (all model year Chevy Traverses are known to have transmission issues, and I knew this going in). When I reached out to Sara, she told me to come by anytime that was convenient for me.

The issue was not with the transmission, but with the torque converter, and after exhaustive research both online and talking to knowledgeable friends, I was confident there was no way they could have known about this issue before it showed up. Despite having sold me the car as-is (no warranty), Sara enthusiastically worked with me to find a transmission specialist to correctly diagnose the problem and help me decide on a course of action to repair the issue, given that the issue was complicated and many things couldn't be known before the transmission was opened up and inspected (the car wasn't throwing any error codes). It helped that Hawthorn has been around a long time and has built a solid reputation and network with auto specialists around Southern CA, which they bring to the table to help their clients in situations just like this.

When the repair estimate came in, Sara negotiated a better deal on my behalf and kicked in a few hundred dollars to defray the costs. I am 100% satisfied with how Hawthorne handled my purchase and the transmission problem that showed up. They weren't obligated to do what they did based on the purchase contract, but it shows that they care about doing right by their customers and building lasting relationships that they did what they did.

Hawthorne has impeccable business practices and showed me exactly what a used auto dealership should be.<//Text>

<text>Sara is amazing !!! All the people that work @ Hawthorne Motors have great working attitude and treat everyone that come in looking for a car with a lot of respect. My brakes on a BMW that I purchased from Hawthorne motors had a bit of a squeak .... I called Sara and let her know the problem and she took care of it right right away... she has followed up with me about 3 times after my purchase ... that’s amazing customer service to me ! Id refer anybody looking for a car to go to Hawthorne motors and ask for Sara but if she’s busy I know others can help you everyone one was nice that I talked to that day ! 😊</text><resp>{'time': 1592417090961, 'text': 'Thank you for the amazing review.

This is the best auto dealership in Southern California. My wife and I have been using them for the last 10 years. We have purchased over five cars and never had a problem. Hollywood Motors Express are like family to us. Sarah and her mother and father are the best. I would recommend this dealership to anyone. If you need a good and reliable vehicle they are the ones to go to!

Best regards

My daughter moved to LA on short notice and my job was to help her secure a car.  I called Hawthorne Motors because they had good reviews and a car that I thought would work.  On the way from LAX to look for apartments my daughter and sister stopped to drive the car.  It was as good or better than described, Sara kept the price to what was discussed on the phone and was very helpful and courteous throughout the purchasing process.  Thank you!<//Text>

They treat me from the heart. It was the best customer service I ever had; they treat their customers like family. Best car buying experience ever, very friendly, great prices. Also great selections of cars. Bough a 2013 BMW X6 from them and absolutely love it. Thank you Mr. Shabazian and Sara (Hawthorne Motors Express)< /Review>

This car lot is the best, let me tell you why.
The owners Hass & Ms Vickie are Great Folks, there family.
But there is one other person that make all magic happens and that’s  Sara aka “GETTER DONE 🏃‍♀️“
If you’re looking to purchase a nice car and been having trouble getting Financing GETTER DONE at Hawthorne Motors Express is where you MUST go and see Sara. You will roll out the same day with that car you pick.
It’s a family affair, there honest, you will be treated as family and they will take care everything.

Hawthorne Motors Express is a great family-owned business and that is definitely reflected in the service that we received there. We received personalized, friendly help when purchasing our car. The car was in pristine condition, was well taken care of, and a great value. After our purchase, they reached out to ensure our satisfaction. We will be long-term customers and come back when it's time to purchase our next vehicle.</Text>

Found this little hidden gem when I Came from another dealer that tried selling me a car that was in bad condition and made me feel like they just didn’t care about anything but money. I was nervous about coming here especially after that experience but I’m so glad I did. This wonderful family owned business made me feel so much more comfortable and did everything in their power to help me get the car I wanted and I’m so satisfied with the experience. I definitely recommend this place for anyone trying to purchase a good quality used car and for someone who is looking to have a great buying experience. I wish I would’ve come here for all my car purchases.< /Review>

Im a first time buyer and i really needed another car and they made sure my first experience was easy , the process was so easy it took less than 3 hours and everyone at this dealership is so friendly and nice , they even have a cute dog there to greet you , sara definitely worked hard to make sure i got the car i wanted and i ended up leaving with the car that i wanted with a good down payment and a low monthly car note , im so glad i went to them , they will work with you , go to sara she’s the best , i even got a lower rate than what i had got before ,they answered all my questions with no problem, I really appreciate everyone there they treat you like family , i will definitely tell more people about this place and i will definitely  get a another car from them<//Text>

This place was so friendly and felt as though I was a part of the family. Sara and Abraham worked quickly to get us checked out and on the road with our new car. Sara even missed a work out class and stayed a little bit after hours to get the job done. Great cars and a great warranty program helped me feel confident in my purchase. They also got me a better deal than I was going to get through another company. I would highly recommend purchasing a car from this place. Great staff and they will work with you to make you satisfied.< /text>

<review>While car hunting, I came across Hawthorne Motors Express and instantly fell in love with a bright blue Dodge Charger that was being advertised. After reading such great reviews, I knew I had to go see it! Upon test driving it, I decided that it was THE car I wanted. As a first time buyer, Sara and her parents made it so incredibly easy on me from the get go. She worked hard to get me financed and squared away, and she is SO friendly, upbeat, and welcoming. Such good vibes from this woman and her family. All of the staff is amazing, Abraham deserves special praise as well, he really went above and beyond to make sure my new blue beast of a car was ready to go.  (Shout out to Lily, the gorgeous sweet little pup who will usually be there to greet you in the lobby! Love her!) My boyfriend and I felt absolutely at home on their lot. Not only was the car in wonderful shape, but it’s the little things that really matter as well. You can tell that they really care about their customers, and will definitely go the extra mile to make you happy. I am so grateful, and so happy that I chose to go with them. I would recommend Hawthorne Motors Express to anyone in the market for a new ride. Thank you, Sara and family! :)< /review>< Pictures>

There is no way around this place if you are looking to buy a used car! It is a fact. Service and friendliness of the staff in this place are outstanding. They won't be happy if you aren't walking out of there happy. The selection of cars also offers a good variety. This is the place to go!< /text>

One of the best car buying experiences you will ever have. I am in the process of buying a car with Hawthorne Motors Express and I must say it is a experience I will never forget. Family owned and operated great selection of vehicles, upfront, honest, warm and comforting buying experience. Not pushy or forcing you into something you don't want or like but makes you feel like family while helping to put you into the next car of your dreams. Highly Recommendable. Thank You Hawthorne Motors Express!!!!< /text>

Couldn't ask for better working with Sara. Incredibly patient and professional. She helped me with my purchase from A to Z to finding the exact vehicle for my price target.

Experience was seamless and an absolute joy that I would, without hesitation, hit up Hawthorne Motors Express for my future vehicle purchases.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This an awesome family ran business. That makes you feel appreciated when you walk through the doors. Sara was awesome to took the time to find me financing due to student loans that lowered my credit score. Although it was challenging she made it happen!

<review>I had the best experience at Hawthorne Motors Express. I had the unfortunate displeasure of being sold a lemon from a nearby dealer. I was able to return that car and I then stopped by to see what HME had to offer. They have a wide selection of vehicles to choose from. My heart was sold on a beautiful SUV. And get this; the SUV ONLY had two previous owners, no accidents and only had 88,000 miles on it!! I am pleased as punch about my purchase. I recommend Hawthorne Motors Express to anyone looking to purchase a reliable pre owned vehicle. They can help get you financed or you can bring cash. One thing I thought was really refreshing is that this is a family run business and you can tell. They are very hospitable and welcoming. Stop by for yourself.</review>< response>

Most people dread having to deal with Car salesman, and I know I did when I moved out here. But this was by far the most pleasant experience I've had purchasing anything. Abraham was super helpful and full of information, and Sara worked with us all day to make sure everything was in order and the car was perfect and ready for me to drive it out that day. They take care of all of the financing and we didn't have to go to the DMV for anything. I've had the car a couple weeks now and I love it! I would rate higher if I could.< /review>

Thank you to Haas, Sara and especially Kim for helping me with purchasing this car. Although I have a decent credit score, I didn't have much credit history so I was only approved for about 15k. They were still able to help me get a beautiful car with a very low monthly payment. My sister, cousin and roommate have all bought cars here and have also had wonderful experiences. If anyone I know is looking for a car I will tell them to come here first.</Review>

I recently purchased a 2013 Dodge Challenger from Hawthorne Motors Express and my car buying experience could not have been better. Vicky and Hoss were both extremely helpful and walked me though the entire process explained any questions that I had and at no point did i feel that I was being lied too or promised something untrue. I would highly recommend Hawthorne Motors Express to everyone in the market for a used vehicle.< /Text>

<review>I recently purchased a 2012 Mini Clubman from Hawthorne Motors Express. The car is beautiful and everyone I spoke with in the office was very helpful and friendly. Vicky was very patient with me, answered all my questions, and made me feel very comfortable throughout the process. I would recommend this dealer to anyone looking to buy a used car.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Was looking for a car for quite some time coming from Palmdale, luckily a great friend of mine showed me this wonderful place which there was a variety of choices of cars to pick from ! They were all reasonable and good looking cars as well I bought my car and have been driving it for about 2 weeks now and I love it ! I’m so happy I came down and made the choice I made 💚 also customer service there was amazing they helped me out with everything and explained everything very clear for me . Great family business and I for sure will recommend you guys to my friends and family ! Thank you sooo much Sara I appreciate you . Even the dog was friendly and loving ☺️

I recommend this place to all my family and friends. From the moment I got on the phone with them till I walked out the door they treated us like family and gave us a better deal than anyone else in town. I got a 645I BMW from them low mileage best price like new. I'm definitely coming back to purchase another car from this place.They went above and beyond to make sure we were completely satisfied and comfortable with are purchase. Excellent in every way<//review>

2004 Jeep Liberty- I was searching a long time to find a used car dealer with the type of car I wanted and the price I wanted to pay until I got to Hawthorne Motors Express they did it all. They had the car I was in love with, with an affordable price. I picked the car, got a price, took it for a spin and all paper work was done in less than an hour. It was amazing! I loved the hospitality they all had. I loved how it was a family owned business too. If I were to ever get another car, it would definitely be from them! I'm sending everyone I know to them!! Thank you Sara & Hoss!!!

It has taken me nearly a day to write this review because words cannot truly describe my feelings for this dealership.

This is a family owned business that truly makes you feel like family. They went above and beyond the call of duty to help my wife and I. They were patient, kind, caring but most of all they were supportive and not judgmental.

They have great cars that are reasonably priced I would recommend this dealership to anyone especially if your credit is not the best. They will not sell you  a lemon but they will help you make the right choice. The salesmen their are amazing as well.

I would give them 10 stars but 5 is the best they offer</Review>

Recently bought my first car here. A 2012 Chevy Malibu LTZ.  I love it! The staff is amazing and very patient. They helped me with everything I needed and didn't pressure me to buy a car like other dealers. The price was good and the car was in very good condition. Why spend so much money on a new car when you can get a used car that's just as good.<//Review>

A family company willing to go out of their way just to help the customers out.  I purchased a 2012 Ford Focus and i am very happy with the purchase.  The staff was so out-going and made my family and i feel right at home.  In the future i plan to return to get my next car from there also. If you're looking for a good used car this is the place to go.<//Review>

<gmapID>0x80c2b4514244346d:0xdaa0b93e6a7d34bc</gmapID><text>So my girlfriend and I went in to buy a car from Hoss and his family. They are extremely friendly. We ended up getting a amazing deal on a 2010 Chrysler Town & Country Stow & Go Mini Van. The van is absolutely great. They had it detailed and gave it to us with a full tank of gas. We ended up finishing the deal 2 hours after closing and they did not try to push us out or hurry us along at all. I have bought several cars at several dealers over the years and they have been the friendliest thus far. Its a very casual business with NO PRESSURE. It was a great experience for my girlfriend and I. We will definitely recommend them to are friends and family.<//text>< pics>

I purchased a BMW 745 From Hoss and his family a couple months ago. The process went very smooth and the service was excellent. It was a family owned business that was ran professionally and they treated me with care and kindness before and after the sale. Anytime I contact them they are more than willing to help me resolve any issues. I would definitely recommend any car buyers to check here.< /text>

They stood by their word and took care of it. Businesses that don't emphasize customer service, don't last. This family owned business is a special one and we'll be around for a long time.<//text><rating>5</rating>< username>

This place is AWSOME!!! No haggle prices they are so low...I worked with Sara and she was very friendly from the beginning to the end..My credit was not so great but she kept at it until she found me a bank. She even lowered my payment by 500.00 so i did not have to pay the finance charge from the bank...I will be back to purchase again and again..THANK YOU FOR MY NEW TOY....2KC54ME!!<//review>

I purchased a 08 Toyota Corolla at this dealership, and the people were very welcoming and friendly. They weren't like other dealerships trying to pressure you into buying a car. The owner of the dealership was a really sweet guy. If anyone is looking for a vehicle I highly recommend this place.</text>

After a two day encounter with Hawthorne Motors Express we got straight to the point.  I knew exactly what I wanted and the Staff walked me right through everything from start to finish.  The Salesman was  very knowledgeable in the car I was interested in.  The young lady Sarah (spell check) was outstanding made sure I was squared away with everything!! I can tell the staff really love what they do because it shows in their customer service skills. They have a wide range of cars on the lot and they are marked at at very reasonable price.. Overall Great experience shopping at H.M.E, definitely have my recommendation!!<//Text>

My first transaction was so good that of course I already knew I was going to do my 2nd car purchase with them as well. This is a family owned business that truly treats you like you are part of the family. Everyone is so caring and concerned and they all want to make sure that you leave their dealership happy :) They are fair and do not push you into buying a car that doesn't fit your needs. If it's not right for you, they will find you a car to fit your liking and budget. Minor repairs are fixed without hesitation and warranty's are given so you leave feeling secure. I am a loyal customer because they are loyal car dealer.<//text><Date>1412994791225<//Date><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

I got an awesome deal on a 2016 Ford Focus back in August at this place, but what I really loved is how warm and welcoming the owners were toward my wife and I. Vicky, Sara and her dad were all very respectful, friendly and patient at all times. Will get a car for my wife here pretty soon.< /text>

This purchase was the easiest most stress free transaction I have ever experienced. I have purchased many cars before and never felt as comfortable with my purchase as with Hawthorne Motors Express!!! This family run business treats their customers like family as well!!! From the beginning there was never any high pressure sales techniques, they were honest about the vehicle I was purchasing and put everything they promised in writing!!!! They even topped off my gas tank since I drove so far to their location!!! I will definitely recommend them to friends and family and they will be my first stop when I'm ready for my next purchase!!!!!</Text>

I recently bought a car from Hawthorne Motors Express and it was one of the best buying experiences I have had. I had shopped around at other deals in LA and Orange County and hands down they had the best customer service of any dealership I went to. They made the process very quick and easy. They worked with me to make sure I was very comfortable and happy with my purchase. Sara and Hoss did an amazing job and even remembered me when I came back a couple weeks later. I have already recommended them to friends I know who are looking to buy a car.

Found my vehicle on their website, did the online credit approval process. It was smooth and simple. Came in the next day and test drove the car, signed the paperwork and was out in less than an hour. A couple days later I noticed a rattle in the rear end of the car, called and they asked me to bring it in and have them take a look. The owner rode with me over to the repair shop and told them to do whatever needed to be done to get it fixed. They did and I was on my way.

This is a wonderful family owned and operated business that I would definitely recommend. And Sara is extremely helpful and great to deal with.< /text>

<text>Hawthorne Motors Express is by far the best used car dealership in Los Angeles! Wide – ranging car selection and wonderful customer service! I recently purchased a 2011 Scion; Perfect condition and low miles. I could not be more satisfied! At the time of purchase, I was torn between two cars in the lot. The friendly staff at Hawthorne Motors Express gave me specific details on each car. After a round of test driving, I decided on the Scion. Sara spent a good amount of time trying to get me financed. She went above and beyond to find me the best rate for my car! As a family owned and operated used car dealership, Hoss and Sara offered the best customer service; Hoss even offered me lunch while I waited! HUGE PLUS! If you want exceptional customer service, I recommend Hawthorne Motors Express!<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2b4514244346d:0xdaa0b93e6a7d34bc</gmap_id><rating>5<//rating>< UserId.>

I am very happy with my experience at Hawthorne Motors Express.  I don't do thinks quickly, often due to work and also I need to consider ALL my options.  The entire staff was very patient with me.  I'm also credit challenged and Sara worked on that and gave me the most competitive rate in the entire South Bay!  Everyone who works at HME is friendly, helpful, professional, and funny!  I had a good time there. :)  NOT STRESSFUL.   Truly, I love the car I bought, got a great price,  and I loved that this is a family owned and local business.  I would recommend them because HME is fair, will answer your questions, and give you a good deal.  Daisy was also very entertaining (their dog) who sits in the office.  Go give them a try!< /review>

I've always been turned off by dealers and pushy salesman. I sent an inquiry through the internet. They immediately called to let me know that they were working on the terms. I went about my day, and when I finally made it to Lawndale, I was greeted warmly. I was impressed by the professionalism, but family fun atmosphere in the place. They not only seemed to enjoy what they do, but enjoyed each other. My wife was able to get the car she wanted with no hassle. I've referred my brother and a few friends here. I will definitely be shopping here first for my next car purchase.<//review><Response>None< /Response></record>

We recently purchased an Mercedes Benz Glk350 from Hawthorne Motors Express and were very pleased with the whole process. Our friend Haas, was really helpful in showing us the features of the car and he was able to give us a good deal.We are extremely satisfied with the car and with the purchase experience.</text>

I LOVE Hawthorne Motors Express!!! The family who owns this business is a gem! They truly know what customer service is and treated me with such respect and integrity. I was dreading the experience of finding and buying another car, and after going to a few other pushy dealerships I had nearly given up, but once I had stepped into HME, my hope was renewed. They are professional, knowledgeable, and fair. You can trust Hawthorne Motors Express.< /review>

Not your average used car dealership. They buy better cars and most importantly, they actually go through the cars and make repairs--even major ones if necessary. We were fortunate to find the car we were looking for for our daughter, BMW X3, at this dealership. It was by far the best one we saw (we saw 16 of them in 2 months of looking) and the price was on the money. To be honest, their prices on everything we saw there were extremely fair--priced to move. Since they know this, they don't like to deal much; not much need really as they are extremely fair. With our X3, they put on brand new Pirelli tires, new brakes and rotors and had a window regulator repaired with OEM parts. We asked for two keys and they even did that for us. The owners are family and in the end made us feel as though they really cared that our daughter's first car was going to be safe, reliable and as close to new as possible. Quite a breath of fresh air when it comes to used car dealerships. You can be confident in a purchase from this place...for sure!< /review>

This was the most rewarding used car buying experience ever. The staff were extremely helpful  in finding the car that fit most to me. The family owned atmosphere is heavily apparant as you will fill part of the family also, after purchasing your vehicle. They had great prices on cars, that I thought otherwise would be higher, but they've got the deals that will make you squeal. Made buying my Jetta extremely easy, thank you Hawthorne Motors Express.</Text>

Gotta start off by saying that if you have bad credit and need a great car, Sara and her family are the people to see. They got me a payment that i couldnt believe and couldnt be happier. She was very helpful and laid back throughout the entire process and really worked ti earn my business. Her father was also very nice and gave me great tips about my new mazda RX-8. Her mother was also very nice and was working diligently to help another customer. They were also no pressure sales and very family oriented. Will recommend this place to anyone looking for a great car for the best price with great people helping you along the way.<//Text>

I purchased a 2006 Mini Cooper Sport in July and what started out as excitement turned into my worst nightmare!  I drove off and found a chip in the windshield they had hidden by a price sticker, when I started to do some freeway driving a few weeks later I noticed it was not shifting properly.  When I called and spoke to Zara she had me take my car to "their" body shop/mechanic!  How convenient.... Who told me that nothing was wrong with my car and I must me doing something wrong.

Well then I went out of the country for three weeks and my daughter used my car while I was gone and said it was not shifting right and it has continually gotten worse from there.  Now it is so bad, it did not shift on the fast lane on the freeway last week and I was almost hit!  THREE PAYMENTS I have made on this car!

Well, I took my car to Southbay BMW Mini who informed me that not only was the transmission shot, the oxygen sensor was shot.  Those two items alone would have made it IMPOSSIBLE for this car to pass ANY smog test!  Oh, but that is not the only issue with the car, the water pump leaks, the oil pan gasket leaks, and the front arm bushing is torn!  It is no wonder the owner discouraged me from getting it checked out after I purchased it!

I paid $9500 for this car, BMW Mini said the repairs to fix my Mini will be approximately $10,000!

I will be reporting this company and their auto repair division as well to every city, state department for their unethical business practices.<//Text>

I bought a 2009 Chrysler PT Cruiser about two months ago.
All I can say is that I am very pleased so far.

Hoss and Sarah were very friendly and they treated me with respect.
We were able to negotiate a price that worked for both parties.

I went to see a couple of cars/dealerships before coming to HME and they were much worse. I always felt like I was being lied to, whereas here I didn't. Recommended.</text>

My father had purchased a Toyota Tundra from Hawthorne Motors Express so naturally we go check out the place and see a 2007 Mazda RX-8 and was awe struck with the car. The people who work there are really nice and it didnt feel like they were pressuring us to buy the car. This was my first time purchasing a car and it was a pretty good experiece as for the car it is functioning great as of now.< /Review>

When purchasing my first car, everything seemed to be overwhelming. From figuring out if I was getting a good deal and all the financing that goes with it. My first car buying  experience went really well thanks to Hawthorne Motors Express. Right when I walked on the lot with my mom, we were greeted with a big smile from Hoss. Hoss is great! He gave me the best options of cars that was best for me. He gave me his honest opinion about the ones I was interested in which helped me narrow it down. Once I chose the car I wanted, Sara did her magic and it was officially mine. It was the best car buying experience ever! I love that Hawthorne Motors Express is a family run business. I was not overwhelmed at all like going to the bigger dealership. I would recommend them to anyone because they are just that great! I will definitely be back because my brother is thinking about buying his first car as well.

Thanks to Mr. Hoss, Ms. Vicky, Sara and Abraham, you all have been wonderful and such a huge help!</text>

To sum it all up, Good people helping good people! Boy.. where do I begin?!
Absolutely outstanding dealership, made my first car buying experience a pleasant smooth experience. Hoss & Sara truly did whatever they could to get the best deal possible for myself and that fit my budget. The whole staff is amazingly friendly, and looked out for me. They're completely honest and try to give you the best deal possible. I got a great deal on the car of my dreams, thanks to them I'm now a proud owner of a 2007 Mazda RX-8! Thank you guys again Hoss, Sara, and the rest of the staff at Hawthorne Motors Express! Hope to do business with them again soon.</Review>

The entire staff at HME was professional, courteous, friendly, attentive, patient, and supportive.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.  When I was confronted with a situation where financing was in jeopardy due to circumstances beyond all of our control, they patiently assisted the situation to a successful outcome, including helping me return my rental car, providing transportation to my credit union (29 miles away) and providing me with lunch.  That was way above and beyond the level of effort I would expect from a much larger primary dealer.  It is obvious to me from this level of service that they are willing to go the extra mile to help the customer.  I would like to say thanks to all of my new friends at HME for helping me with the purchase of my '07 BMW 750.<//review>

< Review>
My wife and I were shopping for a commuter, hybrid car and through our online search found what seemed to be a great deal, the best actually. We were very reluctant at first because we have never purchased a car from a small dealer. Needless to say we were skeptical.
We arrived at the lot and instantly felt welcomed and valued. The staff wasn't pushy, but very accommodating. The car was just as described except for a broken fog light. Still, my wife and I contemplated not buying it because it seemed too good be true and we suspected maybe the car had a bad history. After a test drive, close inspection, carfax review and a promise to order and install the fog light we decided to take a chance.
Turned out to be be one of the best purchases we ever made and the best car buying experience we've ever had, and we've bought lots of cars.
Sara made the financing process a real pleasure and Hoss was the nicest most sincere man we've come across in a long while. He bought my wife and I lunch and continuously ensured we were comfortable.
It's been a few weeks and we couldn't be happier, Hoss came through with his promise to order and install the broken fog light and we haven't come across another deal this good yet.
I highly recommend Hawthorne Motors Express and look forward to the opportunity to refer business there way.
Thanks to all the staff.
FYI: I've never written a review before. But this was a worthy experience and the way business should be conducted.<//Review>

<review>So I just moved to LA from NYC last week and we all know a car is much needed here.  I had in mind that I wanted a BMW 3 series, my husband got a BMW X5 from an actualy BMW dealership and to put it mildly they totally ripped him off and didn't at all explain the paperwork, pricing, or APR.  Hawthorne Motors Express is great because unlike a lot of used car dealerships they have all their cars online so when I went in, I knew exactly what I wanted and that they had it.  Long story short I bought the car and loved it.  Financing was super easy and they print out a carfax for you so, they really aren't hiding anything.  Great family, they are even helping us out with tinting, rims etc. Would not recommend any other used car dealership except them.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I had looked for the car I wanted (03 Porsche Carrera Cabriolat) for several weeks before finding it at Hawthorne Motors Express.  Viewing my selection on their website was easy, as was the online credit check process.  I got the results of the check that same day, and arranged for a test drive the next morning.  Once a quick test drive confirmed my choice, buying the vehicle was by far the easiest experience I've had out of the five car purchases I've made.

The service was fast, efficient and friendly, and I would recommend that anyone looking to find a quality vehicle at a reasonable price check out Hawthorne Motors Express.< /Text>

The overall process at hawthorne motors was very pleasant. The staff is very friendly and its basically a family atmosphere. I purchased my vehicle and the process was very smooth. I really recommend this dealership if your looking to purchase a preowned vehicle.< /Review>

After looking at many cars at several dealers I could not find the one that called my name. All the other dealers had really beat up cars or advertised a certain car at price but when I showed up(and wasted my gas) they said that was the cash price and not the financing price(they would proceed to jack up the price up another 2grand!). With my not so good credit score, I naturally assumed I would not get approved any where anyway. Finally an ad came up for the car I was looking for at Hawthorne Motors Express so I proceeded to email them about the car. I quickly got a call from in regards to the car and after that moment, they took care of me. I applied online(fast and easy) then got a call back with an approval and a great interest rate! I quickly drove down to the dealer then fell in love with the car. Filled out the paperwork without any pressure from the staff(family owned business). Sara took care of all questions/concerns about the car and financing procedures. In less then 2 hours I was driving home in my mercedes. Thanks alot to Sara and the rest of the staff for a great experience and I will be sure to send all my family and friends there.</Text>

<review>THE BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  I was looking for an Infinity EX35 and I have to say I was a little weary from all the previous dealerships I visited with no success.  I saw the car I  wanted online and I went to Hawthorne Motors Express not really expecting to buy, just to test drive and check out the car.  Even before I got there I talked to Sara on the phone and felt an instant connection with her.  Sara is amazing!  She made me feel so comfortable through the process and she was so patient with me.  I had a lot of questions and a lot of concerns about my credit, about the mileage, etc.  She answered all of my questions honestly and did so with absolutely no pressure.  I met her dad Hoss and fell in love with him too. So helpful, funny, and kind.  I never knew buying a car could be so much fun.  There were a few things I wanted changed on the car and they handled it for me right away and satisfied my every request.  Just when I thought things couldn't get better, I met Sara's mom Vicky.  Beautiful, amazing energy.  What a great family!  When all was said and done I couldn't decide what I loved more my new car or my new friends.  If you're looking for a car, you have to check out this dealership.  They know their stuff.  You won't walk away disappointed!  I LOVE MY NEW CAR! And it's even more special because of Sara, Hoss & Vicky.<//review><name>Renee Jordan</name>< resp>

<review>Absolutely amazing business! This is an excellent family owned and operated business with outstanding customer service, a great selection of cars and a wide range of options. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Shahbazian, are knowledgeable, intelligent and professional.  They will give you a comprehensive overview of each vehicle based upon your interests.  Every detail is properly explained before you leave. Also, Mr. and Mrs. Shahbazian, Louis and the team are honest, upright and fair. I would recommend Hawthorne Motors Express to ALL of my students and colleagues.  Thank you for a wonderful purchasing experience! I wish you continued success!  -Olanna C.

This was absolutely the best car buying experience of my life. I bought a car from them a bout a month ago.  That is saying a whole lot considering I have a very close personal friend(friends since we were 12 I am now 50) who is a GM for one of the big dealerships.  I found the car off an online ad and called.  This is way out of my way considering I live in Claremont, but they were very helpful and friendly on the phone so I went and met with them....boy I am glad I did.  They actually made a minor error on some of the paperwork so I had to go back later in the week and take care of it.  However I didn't mind it even if it was a bit inconvenient its just these peope are just so nice...... Great family run business...<//Text>

I have been looking for a car for more than a week and I've visited most of LA's dealers. Hawthrone Motor Express was the best for me and my budget. They had the required combination of reasonable price/low mileage/good condition and comparatively new cars.
Another thing I liked about this dealership is their prompt response to their customers. I've contacted them by email and they called my phone within 5 minutes. At the same time, I've contacted 5 other dealers and until now no one answered me.
In addition, Hawthorne staff are friendly and they give good advice on their cars and others.
I really recommend this dealer to you<//Text>

<Time>1410976793496</Time><rating>5</rating><Text>I was absolutely pleased with the service I received at Hawthorne Motors Express. I was able to test drive two vehicles that held my interests the day I arrived. I did not have to set an appointment. They both were good quality vehicles as well. When I decided to leave and shop around I was not pulled in to run my information or anything. Syrus was very cool and polite. He was not pushy or pressuring at all like most car salesmen. I decided to come back and they worked the magic for me. Being a first time financer and my job situation it was very likely for me not to get financed without a heavy down payment or cosigner. Sara spoke with many banks and I was turned down one after another. She did not give up and went through all avenues to get me approved. Not only did she get me approved but she got my payments down to exactly what I wanted. I did not have to put down the maximum I was capable of doing either. That is another reason why I like, trust and appreciate this company. They could have easily got more down for a down payment but got me approved without. I believe they were really trying to help me out versus just simply making a sale and getting all they can. I was very comfortable with everyone in the office and felt right at home actually. I will recommend anyone to this lot. They have nice QUALITY rides but most of all THEY PROVIDED A CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE LIKE I COULD NEVER IMAGINE. I will be returning for my next vehicle and sending who ever I know that is looking as well. This is a really good family owned lot that can teach the big ones a thing or two EASY.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I had the best car buying experience ever when I went to Hawthorne Motors Express. When I stepped onto the lot everyone asked if they could help me one by one in friendly way. I did not feel like another sale and no one tried to use any tactics on me.

Luis was my salesperson and was very knowledgeable about the car that I was purchasing. He answered all of my questions and never at any point said, "I don't know."

Kim did a great job of my financing. She built rapport, established my needs, got me the payment I asked for, and set me up with a reputable bank that I was proud to be financed by. The down payment was affordable and she was willing to work with my budget. When she placed calls to potential lenders I could tell that she had a good working relationship with her business associates and they respected her.

Hoss seemed to be completely in control of the office. He didn't micromanage any of the employees, but checked in from time to time to make sure that the transaction was running smoothly and we were doing okay. He actually came out personally while I was on the lot to see if there was anything he or his team could do to assist me and meeting my family needs. My wife and I are proud to say that we purchased a car from Hawthorne Motors Express. Make sure you go to the one that says, "Express," on the building and ask for Luis, KIm, or Hoss.

Came in with my bestie  to purchase a car with less than favorable credit and was able to get an excellent deal that fit the budget. The staff were very personable and extremely helpful. All questions were answered and any issues regarding the vehicles prior to seel were addressed in  timely manner. Definetely somewhere I would recommend to ANYONE looking to purchase a quality vehicle for an affordable price. Cyrus in particular is the go-to guy for car purchases. Kudos!<//text>

<Text>I had just purchased an Infinity FX45 from them yesterday and I must say, had a wonderful experience! They are a family owned/employed business and though I may not be blood related, they made me feel right at home. Haus, the "PAPA", was a genuine delight to be around and he worked along with me to ensure everything ran smoothly. Driving home, I was not only ecstatic to be now driving in my fancy new truck, I also felt really good about our business together and to a consumer, that means everything. Thank You H.M.E.

I had a wonderful experience at Hawthorne Motors Express. Before we discovered this awesome place, we had gone to 4 different places and not even one place offered water nor were willing to budge on their way over priced vehicles.

When we got there, Hoss politely approached us and introduced himself. He let us take our time to look around and ask questions without feeling pressure. We made them an offer below the list price and he was willing to give us the price we felt was appropriate. Once we found a car that we liked, Vicky assisted us with the paperwork. She has a positive, welcoming vibe and made us feel like we were part of their family. I felt in good hands. At the end, we ended up getting an almost new 2015 Kia Forte, 11,000 miles, and  with the manufacture warranty included at a wonderful prize. I would definitely recommend this business if you are looking to buy a pre-owned vehicle at a great price.</Text>

My mom and I have been searching for weeks to buy a new car, specifically a VW Beetle. We've had a pretty terrible experience with Scott Robinson Honda when trying to buy a car and on our way back from there, we spotted a red bug at Hawthorne Motors Express. The first time we walked in the energy was warm and welcoming, Hoss and his family were very hospitable and the buying process was very smooth.I also bought the car as is, but there were a few minor problems with it that Hoss fixed with no hesitation. I really loved the atmosphere and will definitely refer them to anyone I know looking for a car. Very good experience.</review>

I was looking for a used, low-miles prius and searched carfax and craigslist thoroughly. Hawthorne Motors Express had by far the best deal within budget and a car in excellent condition. I drove over an hour from Ventura to Lawndale and was met with great customer service. The husband and wife are extremely warm and friendly - funny yet not pushy. They also have a dog you can play with so that's a plus. You may not able to haggle with the pricing too much, but that's understandable because their asking price is already low. Overall great service and lowest price within a 50 mile radius.<//text>

I recently moved to LA, from NYC. I was overwhelmed by the idea of buying a car. I stopped by several dealerships and got the same pushy sales tactics, we have all grown to hate. Being frustrated by my pursuit, I found Hawthorne Motors online and decided to hike over there on a Saturday afternoon. Despite the place being busy with other people looking for a car. The family who operates the dealership held my hand thru the process. I am a New Yorker, so I never drive and am a fierce negotiator. We settled on a fare price. Now I am the proud owner of a beautiful pre-owned Acura. I could not be happier with the car and the warm service the family provided, otherwise I would not be writing a review.</Review>

Really great experience at this family run business! Purchased a Toyota Solara here; the car was in very good condition with a clean car fax report, smog certified, with oil, etc changed. Prior to purchasing the car, I really wanted to take the car to my mechanic in Venice, which is not close to their location in Lawndale. Hoss, the owner, was very gracious and allowed me to bring the car to my mechanic accompanied by one of his employees. She was really gracious as well; throughout the process, everyone was very nice, respectful, and accommodating. Hoss is very fair and a quite reasonable negotiator. My mechanic did find something needed repair; the right strut was leaking.  We came to an agreement through which he arranged for it to be repaired and covered the cost in lieu of repainting an area of the car with minor scratches, which was fair. Great family, great experience!< /Review>

My niece had a dream and goal to find a yellow volkswagen convertable beetle after moving here to California from Michigan.  After visiting several dealers mostly far and test driving a few lemons we were just about to give up.  I saw the ad on cargurus for a VW beetle at Hawthorne Motors Express and we decided to try one last time.  Oh My Goodness, did we find a winner and worked with the best, best team of professionals ever.  It pays to go to a family owned business as they treat you like family as well.  Hoss was the first we met and what a lovely, wonderful man.  Sara was next who took care of us from beginning to end with the best financing possible and explained everything.  Luis, the salesman was so awesome and patient as we drove the car a couple of times and he immediately jumped to helping us out.  While in the office and completing the paperwork which was explained to us step by step we met Hoss's wife Vicky who just kept the conversations going and lively.  Of course Daisy their dog too was a cutie.  I can't thank you all enough on helping us with this purchase and making a dream come true.  I will be sure to forward all searching for a car your way.< /text>

One of the best car buying experience of our lives...Stumbled upon Hawthorne Motors Express, in Lawndale, via the internet. We were looking for a specific car and this dealership was advertising this car, but the site didn't include any pictures, they had recently just acquired the car. I called for more than a week, everyday, inquiring about internet pictures and was told for more than a week that, they were detailing the car, and pictures would be put up that day or they would email me the pics; the pictures were never put up online, or emailed; So, my family and I finally drove down from Murrieta to Lawndale to check out the car. This is the only reason why I didn't grade them excellent.

Upon immediately seeing the dealership I was a little skeptical, because it's a small mom and pop dealership, but they had a great selection of cars no older than 2006 and the prices were impressive. We were immediately greeted by the owners daughter, Sara, and the owner himself Hoos, came over later to introduce himself. They were very friendly and immediately directed us to the car we were interested in. They gave us time to inspect the car w/o pressure, the imperfections we addressed and immediately taken care of, the test drive was great, and when we asked to take the vehicle to an independent shop of our choice to get it inspected, there were no objections. At no time did we feel pressured into purchasing this car.

We decided to purchase the car, after getting it checked out, and while the car was priced below 'Kelly Blue Book' value, we negotiated and got Hoos to reduce the purchase price even more. From the time we began the paper, til the end, it took maybe 15 minutes. My husband and I have purchased more than 10 cars in our lifetime and we've never had such a wonderful experience. This is a dealership that I would definitely recommend to family and friends.

< review>
(Translated by Google) I got 2011 Acura RDX (Turbo) from Hawthorn Motors Express. I would say that this was the best dealer I ever visited for their kindness, honesty, warmth, and care. I received almost all of the information I needed to get a car and I was amazed. Since I am from Korea, I am going to write something down in Korean. This dealership is run by the family and is run by the president and his children. With so much clean work, honest prices, and excellent service, I was really happy with the A + class and bought the car. Acura had a very difficult time finding a car in 2011 that was very difficult to find, and when there was a problem during the ride up to 1000 miles, there was always a policy to fix it, so I was not worried about the car problem. I want you to come here and solve it at once. It is much more helpful if you go to the homepage beforehand and look at the car.

There is a reason there is no wait.  Aurtoro is not someone I would describe as a people person.  He isn't friendly and wanted to charge extra for things uncommon when getting a smog check anywhere else.  He asked $35 to open cover to access my engine??? I couldn't recommend him.  Suggest Daniel at A1 down the street.  Will definitely get a more pleasant experience, but there might be a wait.</Review>

I arrived at the smog check a little after 5pm today. The guy was already closing shop. He saw me pulling up and asked if I needed a smog. I said yes and that today was the last chance I had to do it. He re opened and did my test for me. I was so happy. I will definitely return and recommend to all my friends =)  Thank you again!< /Review>

My engine light went on a few days ago, not knowing it would cause for my smog check to fail, I brought it in for its smog check.  When I got to Barstow Smog Check, the tech told me there would be a fee whether it passed or failed.  He then asked me if my engine light was on, when I told him it had gone on a few days back, he recommended that I get it checked by my mechanic first because that would automatically fail the smog.  I followed his advise, took my car in to a mechanic, thankfully it was a minor fix (gas cap).  When I brought my car back for its smog, it passed!  I am so glad and thankful that the tech was honest with me on my first visit. He saved me $53.  I would definitely recommend this place.< /review>

Best of the best restaurant, the server Ashley is so nice and takes care of the order fast and servers with a smile and good attitude. The food is very very delicious and on time. The environment is very good also. The rest room is very dirty and they need to have a good janitor 24/7.<//Review>

I am pretty sure they were out of almost every kind of beer I wanted to try, but with situation in the world the way it is, I'll give them a pass. The pizzas are well worth the price and the best deal by far if your trying to be nice to your budget. Patio seating is available, staff was following all protocols and wearing their masks properly. Great spot in River Park.</text>< pics>

<Review>The food is always pretty good. Great vegan options, however the bartenders are always rude. I don't get why. But when I'm having a date night with my wife I always hope for good service which rarely happens here. We really like the food but I just wish the service was better.<//Review><Rate>2<//Rate><pictures>None</pictures><date>1620454422063< /date>< Resp>

Sat at the bar today. When asked for my ID I pulled my wallet out to get it. I carry my ID card and also my driver's license. I took my ID to show him and he made a big deal that I had 2 forms of ID and made me take them both out to "see if they matched up". It's none of his business what else I have in my wallet. His job is to check that I am of age not to worry about how many forms of ID I carry in my wallet. Andrew was his name. He was rude and has no business behind the bar.< /review>

Service and food were good. The waitstaff was accommodating, and was often enough at-elbow to refresh glasses but not so much so that you felt bothered by their presence. As far as dining experience goes, I would recommend it for someone looking to spend some time sitting down to eat but not spend a large amount of money; however, if you are looking to dine on a budget, I would suggest you look elsewhere, since the prices tend to the low side of mid-range. All in all, I would eat here again.< /review>

I ordered all meat well done no pink at all, and I got the complete opposite l would consider it close to medium rare. Secondly it ask if you need utensils to eat l selected the box saying yes, and of course l get back to my hotel room and there's none in the bag... l had a salad and rice so not sure why they wouldn't make sure.

<Review>There food is pretty good. We noticed they do tend to under cook things even tho you personally requested well done.... But they happily re-do the food for you and give a discount for having to wait again, witch is very nice of them. The staff was very friendly. They made sure to keep an eye on our refills and asking if we needed anything else.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Location to the hotel I was staying at was close. They had huge tents set up so they could accommodate a bunch of people outside safely. Lots of heaters were on as nice came and got a little chilly. Food was great had a steak bowl and wife had lobster noodles. For dessert bread pudding the brookie which is a brownie and cookie cooked together with whipped cream and a scoop of ice cream. The waitress was great always around and checking on us.</text>< GmapID>

Even though it's outdoor dining at the moment it was nice to be outside. A little chilly but it was worth it. Food was great and drinks were delicious! We went on a weekday so waiting for a table for two, we were seated quickly.</Text>

Food was amazing. Our server was really professional. The only bad side is the hostess put my name down wrong and my phone number wrong so instead off waiting the 15 min.-20min wait. We waited 1hr 45min...... so make sure you ask for verification on your name and #...< /Review>

Also the beer has been the same basic selection as LA and Vegas so if you've been to one on the west coast for beer and want someone thing unique in Fresno go elsewhere as there are more an upcoming spots now.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Very good food, a lot.if variety.  Dont expect a quiet atmosphere--Sports Bar. Be warned they will not seat you, or put you on the list until all your party is here.  Not recommended if you have people in your family who are perennially late.< /text>

<Review>A great time and clean covid-19 social distancing,  friendly staff. Quick service and delicious menu . Drinks on drinks . Excellent choice of beers on tap. Drink specials and a healthy menu. Definitely recommend this establishment for your next dine-in, patio, or even just for a drink.</Review><gmapID>0x8094681df688aa95:0x49d915a352be1b3b</gmapID>< Rate>

Menu is greatly reduced due to Covid-19, but we were able to get our "usual" which is the chicken nachos. Staff was friendly and service was quick.</Text>

<review>The brews and drinks were good. Yard size is interesting but not so great if the drinker is short. Food has many options but we only got onion rings which were cooked perfectly. Staff was a bit meh but it was a very busy Saturday (45min wait). Will return when dine in returns.

Trip 2 - Didnt realize till second round that they sell growlers. Kinda pricey but who doesnt need a 64oz beer to go. I know i did.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>First time being here and it was amazing. I strongly recommend the woodfire salmon ! The sweet sauce added a perfect combination to the woodfire taste plus the mash potatoes was great as well. The drink was  a black cherry martini i believe . Great choice of drink.it tastes well and has a good kick to it.< /text>< time>

<Text>Had the best waitress !! Food was amazing as well....I gave it only 3 stars because I was not treated  in the respectable way I should've been by a waiter when I went to use the restroom.
I was told in a not so nice way I needed a mask to use the restroom.
It was not said in a respectful manner at all.  I also found it unprofessional to be shouted at from several feet away, he made no attempt to approach me , continued barking the order at me, until I turned around to approach HIM to allow me to understand what he was saying,  and to interact the way a proffesional should.   When I returned from retrieving my mask, he was still chatting away to another employee, although he thanked me , it was said as though I was beneath him and in a patronizing tone.
I was very surprised by his behaviour. Our waitress on the other hand, was AMAZING.  I have only good things to say about her as well as every other employee besides that waiter.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I enjoyed the jambalaya, but couldn't keep my hands off my wife's  Teriyaki salmon. Good stuff! Excellent variety of beers and mixed drinks.< /Review>

< Review>
The brews and drinks were good. Yard size is interesting but not so great if the drinker is short. Food has many options but we only got onion rings which were cooked perfectly. Staff was a bit meh but it was a very busy Saturday (45min wait). Will return when dine in returns.

Trip 2 - Didnt realize till second round that they sell growlers. Kinda pricey but who doesnt need a 64oz beer to go. I know i did.< /Review>

< Review>
We have been several times and had great experiences each time. We ate there 11/16/20 and the food was awful. My wife ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken (we have ordered several times) and it was awful. She sent it back and it came back equally bad. The Chicken was soggy and tasteless. Definitely overpriced and a bad experience for us. Going to be a while before I could try it again. Service was the plus, very hospitable</Review>

<user_name>Alex Fabela<//user_name><review>We had called ahead of time and asked if we could make reservations, but were told no and that it was first come first serve, but the wait was only 1 hour. My family and I arrived at 6:30 and put our names on the list. As we waited other groups showed up of the same number and were being seated before us. When asked, the hostess stated that their names were written down prior to us showing up, but they left the vicinity. So they did do reservations and waited for the party to arrive before continuing. Also, when their name was called the full party wasn't there and we had to wait until their guests arrived. That took 30-45 for the full party to arrive and still be seated before my group. I mentioned this and was told that we were next. 1 hour wait was actually 2 hours and 15 minutes. Once we were seated my family ordered drinks, which took 15 minutes for them to get. The waiter dropped the 23 oz beer on the table as he was not paying attention and got beer on my in-laws, wife and my son. The food was ok, 6 out of 10. At the end of the night we payed and left very disappointed with the way the restaurant was ran. We just got an "I'm sorry." I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone I know. My first time was great, but last night was ridiculous.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I always love their poke nachos. They are my favorite. Calamari too. I tried the boneless Korean wings for the first time, and it was ok.  Something is off with the sauce. But definitely coming back here again and again everytime I crave for their poke nachos.
Our server tonight is amazing. Thank you Ashley. And hostesses were super nice too.<//review>< Pics>

The sweet sauce added a perfect combination to the woodfire taste plus the mash potatoes was great as well. The drink was  a black cherry martini i believe . Great choice of drink.it tastes well and has a good kick to it.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>My first visit definitely made a positive impact. Great location within the always awesome River Park complex. I live in another town, but visit Fresno for a variety of reasons. And a hot lunch with a cold beer happens to be one of them.

And with maybe 120 options for a cold brew, who could ask for anything more! Brews are a world of their own, and the helpful barman sure knew his business. Samples available upon request.

I commented on the hefty menu, 3 pages of beers!, then reviewed a great selection of appetizers, salads, light lunches (halfsies), and full-on dinners. Whew!

I mentioned it was my first visit and was informed there are maybe 80 locations nationwide. Call me clueless. Another buddy in Bako says theirs isn't open yet.

When you're in North Fresno and are hungry and thirsty, check out the Yard House.</Text>< pictures>

Kind and quick service. We were told the wait would be about 30 mins and only waited about ten. Once we sat down, we got our drinks and food really quickly. Outside dining wasn't that bad. Was a little warm, but the misters really helped to keep us comfortable. I got the BBQ bacon burger and it was cooked to perfection. Definetly coming back. 😁</review>

Great experience. Quality food, yet casual atmosphere with prices somewhere in between. Not too loud like a lot of sports bars, but lively atmosphere. Functioning and helpful ziosk devices at the table and great staff! Will be back. Great happy hour deals.< /text>

Food was amazing. Had the tortilla soup  and the abuelita's chicken. For a place that is not a Mexican restaurant. The plates had authentic flavors. Being my first time there the server brought out a desserts sampler.  The cobbler was great as for the chocolate souffle decadent flavor.  Very impressed.  Will definitely be making a trip back. Oh and the service was excellent.  Food came out fast and hot.</text>

Great place! So so so many options. This place has a menu like Cheesecake Factory, it's huge.
Great food time and time again. Many different drink options.

The Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich was delicious, upgraded from fries to onion rings, wow! Try the YardHouse Tripel, best beer I've had in a long time.</review><user_id>108806414935649540369< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x8094681df688aa95:0x49d915a352be1b3b<//Gmap_id><Rate>4</Rate></record>

Food was great, service was great, there was virtually no wait on a Saturday night. Menu is huge and hard to pick from because it all looks delicious. I recommend the seafood garlic noodles. They are incredible. Definitely the best corporate dining experience around.</review>

<Review>Had lunch here with my husband. It was my first time. We ordered their Tri tip sandwich, side order of fries, onion rings and garlic bread. It was delicious! We didn’t wait very long and got our orders in about 10 minutes. Will definitely come back. Service was friendly and fast. 😊</Review>< pics>

Food was great, service was great, there was virtually no wait on a Saturday night. Menu is huge and hard to pick from because it all looks delicious. I recommend the seafood garlic noodles. They are incredible. Definitely the best corporate dining experience around.< /Text>

<review>The place was dark and the music was loud.
However, the food was delicious but I do prefer to see it and enjoy good conversation with friends. My water was also never refilled.

My husband and I went out for dinner. We ordered chicken nachos (they were so much we weren’t expecting) we also order two burgers (which we had boxed up to eat for tomorrow’s lunch). From the moment we walked in the door the customer service was great! Everyone was very nice and helpful. Our service was fast, hot and delicious. Our waitress Janice was great and really sweet. My husband attempted to pay for our bill on the little computer on our table and was unsuccessful but our waitress saw him struggling and came to our rescue. Would recommend.</review>

<Review>Food is a bit overpriced and portion sizes generally on the small side. The Vampire Tacos were bland. BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger and sweet potato fries were delicious. Music was a little loud making it difficult to socialize but I otherwise liked the atmosphere. Overall good variety of food and good service.< /Review>< pics>

I want to give a better review so badly
But the Mac & cheese was horrible
Onion rings obviously not cooked in a “clean” grease meaning no cross frying
Boneless wings 2/5

<Review>The Strawberry Fields Martini was the absolute best! And their Lobster Crab and Artichoke dip, Brussels Sprouts and Potatoes, and their California Roll are AMAZING! I loved the vibe of this place and we will definitely be back for another date night. Highly recommended! Fast service, great hospitality!</Review><userid>102482086921281501812</userid>< Name>

<text>Servings are huge!!! Very nice and relaxed atmosphere. One of very few places where you really get your money's worth. The Spicy Jambalaya is outstanding. My server Spencer was very helpful and friendly and very knowledgeable in the food and drinks. Can't think of any negatives about the Yard House.</text>< Pics>

Decent food, but probably better known for their bar.  Truffle fries are excellent.  Chicken nachos are solid, get chips on the side.  Burger are just okay--underseasoned< /text>

<Text>Me and my family have been coming here almost weekly lately, food is always great very consistent, prices are very good for what you get. My favorite is the lobster garlic noodles and you cant beat it for the price, the steak is also very good and there house steak sauce is the only steak sauce I've ever enjoyed. Our server Spencer was super attentive and made sure our drinks never got empty and constantly checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed and actually took my 3 year old sons order and listened to him which made my son very happy and even the kids mac and cheese is really good and not some out of the box Kraft macaroni 5 star food 5 star ambiance 5 star service</Text>< Pictures>

Never again. The booth our party sat at was dirty & the floor was sticky. The bathroom was disgusting. Our waitress pretty much forgot about us. Besides the food being way over priced & taking a long time to arrive, it wasn't good at all. Dry, no flavor, & small portions. The only "ok" food was the appetizers.</Text>

This was my first time at the Yard House. It is a great place to take family, small group and loved the atmosphere. Music was good, food was great, got to try a lot of new things. I would come back to visit. My only suggestion would be the hand off from one server to another. Our server was getting ready for a break and so forgot a few things and when we were handed off, had to re-order some things though I will say our new server was very attentive and prompt.<//Review>

So. Many. Choices.

Looking for a restaurant that can accomodate our family, which includes one vegan, can be challenging.  Yard House really came through for us.  Lots of great beers on tap.  Many vegan and vegetarian options.  A menu that goes on for days.

Everything was delicious.

We did have a hiccup where there was a long delay on a couple of items, due to a staff mistake.  However, the server and the manager proactively let us know about the delay before we even noticed, and offered to tide us over with a salad or appetizer while we waited.  They adjusted the bill appropriately without our having to ask.  Take note, business owners.  Mistakes happen.  They needn't be a detriment.  They can be an opportunity to shine.<//text>

Yard House is always a good experience, with over 100 beers on tap. The food is also very good, They offer many different cuisines from Asian to Mexican and everything In between. The restaurant seats a lot of people inside and plenty outside on a patio. Happy hour offered on certain days and times. Service is good but busy on weekends, so expect to wait a bit.</Text>

<review>Service. Service. Service. What other reason do you desire for visiting here? You will be cared for and it will be with a smile. Check out Happy Hour from 3:00pm-6:00pm because 50% off nachos is a winner anytime, and the chicken nachos are a meal. Make sure to enjoy some chilled or hot & spicy edamame as a snack.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

A great place for food and beer! The wings are phenomenal and the beer is awesome! I tried the Blueberry beer and the Watermelon Wheat beer and both we're exquisite! They have a huge selection. There must be over 100 beers to try! Drink responsibly :)<//Review>

Amazing choice of beer , really good food, lots of TV's, attentive service.. Great people watching spot and good place to me up with a group of friends.
It can definitely get super busy and there make sure to call for a reservation or if you're sitting at the bar just wait for a seat..< /Review>

<Text>Very positive experience at this location. The fish & chips is an amazing dish, highly recommended. Service was quick and friendly.  If you're looking for a good bar/restaurant with a huge beer list, this is your place.  Also has ton of TVs everywhere playing various sports.  Little noisey inside but overall worth the dining expense.< /Text>< Pics>

Was decent, food took about 20-30 minutes to come out but the ambience is nice so our group was chatting away. Service was top notch nothing to complain here. They have a kids menu with crayons which I appreciate. Food was just so so nothing bad nothing great either I had the truffle fries and wings naked with sauce on the side wings were good but the truffle fries had way too much truffle and the fry itself wasn't great. Husband had a lobster pasta and that too was a bit on the bland side.<//Review>

<Review>If the family isn't with you, I suggest eating at the bar. It is much faster service and easier to get a seat. All if the food is generically fine. Not a lit of originality but usually on point with flavor</Review>< Name>

<Review>Great place to grab a beer. They have a huge selection of drafts on tap. The servers are friendly and helpful. Food was okay. Didn't like the Cesar, the shrimp pasta was okay. They do offer half portions, which is nice. The layout of the tables was poor; the walkway was on top of where you eat. We had to move our table over just so we weren't sitting in the walkway.

I'd go back for drinks, not for food.</Review><name>N DB</name><resp>None< /resp></record>

<review>FOOD POISONING!!! made reservations on march 7th for a party taking place on march 8th for a party of 20 for 10pm. When I got there they said I didnt make a reservation. I showed the manager(angel) when I called and the conversation I had with the staff member. The manager (angel) was insinuating I was lying. I had 20 people in the lobby waiting to be seated and the manager(angel) told me I wont be seated for 3 hours (I made a reservation the day prior to avoid this issue). I explained to the manager that it was already 10pm and they close in 2 hours at midnight so I wouldn't even get seats.  He told me then you wont be getting seated. I explained that I have 20 people here and I cant take them to another restaurant without a reservation because it's too many people. After 30 min of arguing with the manager he finally seated us in the patio. No issues with the service and we had a great time. I ordered the beyond meat burger and my other guests got a variety of other foods including poke nachos. Then next day I woke up to a stomachache and throwing up. My other guests also suffered the same results. I have been coming here often for large parties as my workplace has lots of employees and we often eat here because it can host a large number of  people. I have never had an issue with yardhouse prior, however we had a horrible experience and will likely never return.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

During the evening the lights dim and it's hard to read the menus. The beer selection seems endless and the history of the Yard is cool. The servers seem somewhat overworked and sometimes stressed but always happy to help and admit mistakes when made and usually make up for it gratefully.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

We were accommodated to be able to make it to happy hour. The food we picked hit the spot. I liked the cocktails that I had. Our server was very attentive.
Special shout out to Kate( I hope I got her name right)
She seated us so quick and got our orders fast! We eventually had another server though.< /Text><Name>Mhar A< /Name><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

Food overpriced. Service staff did not ensure food fulfilled the orders members of our group requested. Charges on our bills did not match our orders. Most frustrating was to find a three day hold of $300 on my debit card while the actual charges of $46 for my food and beverages were processed. Not going back! There are better places in town for food and spirits.</Review>

<response>None<//response><Review>Although the service was good the cook burns the food beyond recognition and it tastes like charcoal. My first time there I had a Octoberfest special with overdone chicken and potato salad which was  unrecognisably burned beyond recognition.

The second time I was there I ordered a hamburger which was crusty charred black on the outside. Their cook only understands charring at extremely high temperatures. I don't like to eat charcoal. I won't be going back.<//Review><UserId.>109393430740468810625<//UserId.>< Time>

Food was great, server was awesome, drinks were tasty. Only thing that was disappointing was the host adrian using the restroom and not washing his hands. Other than that it was great. We'll still be coming back. Hopefully the other employees wash there hands.< /Text>

Good food, good drinks, fun and chill atmosphere. Some of the bartenders have way to much of a funeral home/ mortician vibe, like a depressed puppet. People comes out to have fun and enjoy their self,  hopefully management can find some out going bartenders to help make the patrons feel more comfortable. That goes for the waiters as well. This doesn't go for all the staff, but there are a few to many employees here that should bot be in customer service.

Good food and drinks though.<//Review>

< Review>
FOOD POISONING!!! made reservations on march 7th for a party taking place on march 8th for a party of 20 for 10pm. When I got there they said I didnt make a reservation. I showed the manager(angel) when I called and the conversation I had with the staff member. The manager (angel) was insinuating I was lying. I had 20 people in the lobby waiting to be seated and the manager(angel) told me I wont be seated for 3 hours (I made a reservation the day prior to avoid this issue). I explained to the manager that it was already 10pm and they close in 2 hours at midnight so I wouldn't even get seats.  He told me then you wont be getting seated. I explained that I have 20 people here and I cant take them to another restaurant without a reservation because it's too many people. After 30 min of arguing with the manager he finally seated us in the patio. No issues with the service and we had a great time. I ordered the beyond meat burger and my other guests got a variety of other foods including poke nachos. Then next day I woke up to a stomachache and throwing up. My other guests also suffered the same results. I have been coming here often for large parties as my workplace has lots of employees and we often eat here because it can host a large number of  people. I have never had an issue with yardhouse prior, however we had a horrible experience and will likely never return.< /Review>

<review>I had lunch at Yard House recently. I ordered from the Oktoberfest (German inspired dishes) menu. I had the Bavarian Pork Chops, two lightly encrusted chops with wild mushroom sauce, baby broccoli and parmesan mashed potatoes. The chops were quite juicy and flavorful. The mushroom gravy was tasty and savory. The broccoli was perfectly cooked on the grill, and the potatoes tasted very good. I couldn't distinguish the parmesan, which was a bonus, since I actually don't care for the its taste. All in all a very good meal.< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>I have been here several times. For the drinks and vegan food. Service has always been hit or miss. Some really friendly and some not as friendly. The variety is really good. It has happened twice now where a vegan dish had meat in it. They did correct the problem but the first time it happened the meat was eaten. Leads me to believe it has questionable food quality. If I return it'll be to join friends.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x8094681df688aa95:0x49d915a352be1b3b<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I’ve been here many time. I knew this place priced their food on the higher side so I figured I can just order two tacos. I asked the waitress how much two would be (no beans or rice just two plain tacos) and she said about $6 and she told me about the $1 vampire taco special. I got the check and it was not what I was told. I asked her why it’s $12 when I didn’t get anything but two tacos and she said well “they’re about $6 each”. I understand she had nothing to do with the pricing of these items so my complaint is for whoever priced this stuff. Honestly why would I come here to get ripped off and pay $6 for mediocre tacos when I can head down the street to chipotle and get a whole meal for the same price or less. This is such a stupid place and I will not come back again.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaSkgO08YL9S6XKz41LLReHguFQZBcmXVeZ6Nn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Every menu item, from the black shrimp tacos to the margherita pizza to the Cuban sandwich, stands on its own well-deserved pedestal in my heart and stomach as it has conquered my appetite countless times. My God, what a great place.< /Review>

< Review>
My family and I went to Yard House for a last family gathering before I left for my first duty station in the UK. Being that my sister and aunt are vegans, and knowing that Yard House has some excellent vegan options for food and beer, we all settled in with going to Yard House. We were quickly greeted at the door. It was a very busy night inside so we chose to sit on  the patio. The heater had gone out and we were told that they were unwilling to exchange the heating lamp with another empty tables heating lamp. We then ordered the Gardein Pepper Whiskey Wings, and a few other vegan options for our entrees.

Our waiter was nice enough, but only took one order of beer I stead of the entirety of the table. We got our food pretty quickly but had to search for our waiter to get our beers ordered. It was busy after all. We received all of our food at once, appetizer included.

I, not being vegan but having a culinary background and having had the Gardein here before, was immediately befuddled when I realized the appetizer wasn't Gardein. My family and I all decided to make a game of it and try to figure it out. It wasn't until I tried my sister's Gardein Orange Chicken when I finally told them, "You need to stop eating the wings." I explained myself and the food. Our waiter assured us it was Gardein. When we received the bill... SURE ENOUGH. They were not. We were charged for an original order of Whiskey Pepper Wings... We told the waiter and he never took it off the bill. I believe my vegan family members were lead believing that they were eating a vegan appetizer and then decided to charge them for an improperly order item. I'm not saying this is a bad place. I'm not even mad about it. But, I just thought I would share that for everyone.<//Review>

If you’re Black/African Descent be prepared to get walked around the whole restaurant and told there are no booths available when there is clearly many booths available. As well as long wait times.
Racist establishment.
Will not be returning. Not worth your money.</Text>

Why were the BBQ ribs removed from the menu? That was the only good food choice I have ever considered here. I ordered the passion tea, but it was literally just green tea.< /Text>

< Review>
The 14$ bacon burger was a joke. It came with bun, burger party and bacon. No cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion or pickles came with the 14$  I had to ask for condiment for the burger and the plate had maybe 15 overcooked and dry French fries on it. We sat at the bar and no one came to our side of the bar to check on us. Terrible experience. Definitely not worth the $$</Review>

<Text>Ok .. not a good idea of ordering the  classic ranch salad..found out that lettuce was frozen.
The  waitress asked me if I wanted to order something else.. so I ordered a traditional cedar  salad.. full from the garlic and mushroom  noodles dish..the waitress did not tell  me a out the green sticks that looked like skinny green onions..
The waiter on the next shift was a lot more attentive..ordered passion fruit ice tea. Not sweetened  one.  Watching my calorie intake
Of sugary drinks..<//Text>< Pics>

The food was good, all though stuff labeled spicy wasn't, particularly. The beer selection is great, although a couple of the cocktails were a little weak. Overall, a good experience. We will be back!< /Review>

<Text>If you’re Black/African Descent be prepared to get walked around the whole restaurant and told there are no booths available when there is clearly many booths available. As well as long wait times.
Racist establishment.

The other two times I could not get any attention from the bartender, even if I had done a handstand on the bar!  The first time it was like this, the first drink I got was all ice with a splash of something in it (not sure what as there wasn't enough of anything besides ice, to taste).  The second time they brought my meal, but it didn't resemble anything i thought I ordered, and my server never came back so I had to eventually take me cold whatever it was, and chase someone down to get what I ordered.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< review>
Thoroughly the least enjoyable place I have ever taken a date to. Apparently date night equals please put us in the noisiest corner you have between 2 drunk screaming birthday parties I thought maybe they were that busy but no the rest of the establishment you could hear conversations of other patrons as you passed 6 feet away. As far as the service........ she was nice but made no reservation about your on your own cause nothing says service like a quarter of the way through your drink bringing you a refill to compound the message you’re  on your own. As for the food a few hype ingredients but no real flavor if not burnt. And the table...... if you see kegs next to the table they are trying to sit you at say hell no cause when the motor for the fridge kicks on the entire table vibrates violently. Did I mention this was date night? To say the least half way through the meal with my date straining to hear me we finally had a shared mutual thought to leave and not return. And what is with them boxing your leftovers? Like I really want someone probably not wearing gloves to put my food away... anyway save $20 and go to McDonalds it will be far better in the long run.< /review>

And anyone who has food allergies knows choosing a restaurant for the whole family can be challenging. We explained the situation to our Server Grant. Who went over the call of duty. Unbeknownst to us he had explained the situation to the restaurant Manager (Matt Russell). Who immediately came to our table personally not only address our concerns but exicute them as well. What an incredible experience we had. Thank you.

<Text>I've only ever had good experiences here and come here often for the delicious food. My favorite dish is the Nashville Hot Chicken plate, but there is something for everyone here. The few mishaps we've had here have been dealt with quickly and professionally by the staff and besides busy nights we've always been seated and served in a very timely manner.

<Review>There is definitely a variety of options but I don't feel like there is a unique variety of beers like you would find somewhere else maybe that's not a corporation but of all the chains Yard House is my favorite they have amazing happy hour food mixed drinks could definitely be stronger the four stars is mostly due to the amazing happy hour food specials that are also delicious<//Review>< gmapID>

Not our first, more like our 2nd. This place is not only nice but also serves up almost any beer you can think of and the food is really good.

The waiter was very professional and informative when it came to the beers. He had the right flow to where he wasn't pushy,  didn't ignore us, but was there when we needed him. Overall a very good experience and def will be back for more. Dont forget to try the Poke Tuna Nachos. Off. The. Hook.<//review>

Idk, I used to love this place but this time it was just mediocre.  The tortilla chips and guacamole were totally bland with no seasoning.   Did they get new cooks or something!?  The menu seemed different and mot in a good way.  I got the pepper crusted fillet.  Although the steak itself was amazing , the mashed potatoes and asparagus were just bland unappealing plate fillers.  Im so disappointed, I might not be back.  😕< /Review>

Had dinner with family to celebrate my daughter Kayla who finished finals today at Clovis North High School, graduating class 2019. The waitress was cool and hooked her up with chocolate souffle on the "house" 👍. When she went on break she brought another waiter to serve our table which is always nice. The food was delish, lots of beer choices, and some crayons for littles too 😉! Congrats Kayla Rea!!CNHS Broncos 🔜 Fresno State Bulldogs! 🎓🎓</Review>

I love Yard House because of the delicious vegan and vegetarian options that are actually delicious (and not salad.) The only down sides are that the prices are on the high side, as is the volume. You practically have to yell to talk to the person next to you.< /Text>

Great food and great service. Music is often too loud to even allow for basic conversation at your table, which is the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review. I'm all for loud music, but there is a limit to how loud it should be, especially at a place people go to be social.
This is not the easiest place to eat if you have any food restrictions, such as a keto diet, but there are a lot of healthier options and the food is all delicious.<//Review>

Seemed like he did not care much for offering great service. I say, go during happy hour, at least the appetizers will be half off and worth your money by then. Not full priced.

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>This place is horrible, avoid it!  Absolutely do not go here if you want to eat.  The food is bad and the prices are expensive.  Do you like paying high prices for horrible food?  I ordered a hamburger and it came to me absolutely raw and undercooked.  It was served on a plate with wax paper and three slices of pickles.  They forgot to give me fries and when they said they would bring them later the waiter forgot again.  Eventually I got my fries and they were so bad I couldn't even finish them.  My wife had the shrimp vodka pasta dish that she couldn't finish.  Our total bill for this disgusting food and a beer ended up being $52.00. The only thing you pay for is eating a restaurant at River Park.

Please choose another location to eat and enjoy sports.  You can get much better food for 1/3 the price at Dog House Grill and to top it off much better service.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I have spent an evening with my friends at Yard House, had delicious dinner and really nice service.  It is quite expensive there but worth it.
I would recommend to make a reservation for a table.< /text>

<Review>My friends wanted to celebrate my birthday and told me to choose a place to eat. I've never had a problem with Yard House ever. It's been a favorite for me until 4/23/18. I was craving steak and got the 12oz ribeye for $30. I asked for medium well and my steak over extremely well-done and over charred. All I could taste was how burnt the steak was. I'm not a big complainer in general, and so my friend told our server, named Ross, that I was unsatisfied with my meal. I did basically eat my whole plate because my friends and I were waiting for my other friends over an hour so we were starving and therefore, I ate what I had. Ross was nice enough to take my meal to let I believe he's the kitchen manager, or some type of manager in the back know. The manager, Angel came out and told me if I were dissatisfied with my meal, I should have said something from the beginning instead of saying nothing. I told him I'm not much of a complainer therefore was too shy to speak up, and he said it's not about complaining but making the food right for you. If that was the case, he should have noticed that my steak was not medium well from the first place. Angel just had a nasty attitude and ruined my ruined meal. However, Ross is such a great server. He apologized on behalf of Angel and said he handled the situation in the wrong manner. So I'm thankful for Ross. But this problem will definitely make me not come back to Yard House for awhile/ever get steak from here.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The service was very good, food was okay but nothing to really talk about. I ordered the pepper crusted fillet and it was good but they served it with some sauce over it that I didn't care for. Underneath the steak were mashed potatoes. Kind of a small portion size for the entire meal for a lot of money. I'm sure they have some really good items on the  menu though, I will go back. Side note: I went on a Sunday night and even then there were MANY women pretty much half nude wearing skirts so short you could actually see their underwear when they walked, not that I minded, but probably not the best place to take your family with a bunch of hoochie mamas running around looking like prostitutes.<//Text>< user_id>

Great atmosphere, service not so good. Meet a friend at the bar and it took over 10 min for the bar staff to even offer a drink, order a margarita on the rock not my best :(<//Review>

It's been awhile since I've been here. One time was with a friend. We both ordered sushi rolls. Nope, not the ordinary kind. Some newfangled version of what the creator thought would be a nifty way to present sushi. It was too weird. The other time was with a large group of people. It took forever for them to service our food and we all got served at different times. We never could get the drinks ordered all the same time. It was ridiculous. Place is so loud.< /Text>

The food is very good for the price point. However, their service is terrible when they have a surge of customers coming in. It is expected for service to slow down during busier times but I never have had a positive experience during their busier moments.</text>

<review>I never had a problem at yard house before I always enjoy the food, drink selection and atmosphere until 8/22/17. Where I had a negative experience with The general manager.  He  made me really uncomfortable. He was invasive and was questing about my age along with my friend. Yes, I know I look young I can't help it, but he was very rude and questioning me about my age and said my ID did not look like me and asked me to show him my debit card for another form of identification, which, was a red flag for me cause who knows what he could do with that information. I reluctantly did, he was saying I don't look the same and was assuming I had stole this ID from someone or bought it. It just really ruined my whole mood and I felt that my privacy was invaded and at this point I don't think I would ever come back to this establishment. Again, I know I look young and I always know I'm going to get carded, but I never got someone being invasive about my ID and to the point where they need to look at my debit card.< /review><GmapID>0x8094681df688aa95:0x49d915a352be1b3b< /GmapID>< Rate>

It was okay. I had lunch - the cobb salad. Staff was young, not the best social skills but rhey tried and got the job done. Atmosphere was okay. The bar looked fun, I'm guessing that's their main attraction. I'll have to try it again in the evening for drink a with the hubby next time we are in that area of Cali.<//text>

< Review>
Wait staff is great.  Drinks and food came in a timely manner and we were checked on regularly.

All the appetizers during happy hour were very good but I won't order the Ahi Sashimi again.  It didn't taste bad but fancy foo-foo sushi dishes isn't our thing.  Sliced fish, ginger, wasabi, maybe julienne radish....but that's all that's needed for sashimi.  There was a sauce on the plate that everything sat on.

The bill was lower than expected during happy hour deals.  Would come again when in the area.< /Review>

Horrible customer service with mediocre food.  I ordered a mixed drink and could hardly taste the alcohol, had to send it back to be made properly.  Ordered the mushroom lettuce wrap as an appetizer, the server did not mention that the plate and food on the plate were boiling lava hot.  After picking up a lettuce wrap I realized how hot it was and dropped it immediately.  I now have 2nd degree burns across my hand.  The server handled the situation very poorly.  She was arguing that the food was hot at the bottom.  Regardless, finger foods should never ever be served to a customer hot enough to burn the skin.  This place has potential but lacking attention to detail.  I recommend this place go through a change of management and better training for the servers and bus boys.</Review>

<Review>This is the ONLY chain restaurant in Fresno that consistently hits it out the park with their food. Although their items are on the pricier side, the portion sizes and flavours are well worth it.  Hats off to whoever the executive chef and kitchen staff are.<//Review>< pictures>

Trying harder than Applebee's to be hip and serving food no better than Chili's. Crazy loud inside. The TV's are on full blast but still impossible to hear over your fellow diners. Basically a Costco sized Chili's with more menu options.</text>

First there were nine of us going to dinner we tried making reservations and were told they only took reservations for parties of less than six. When we got to the restaurant we were told an hour wait, ok.  One of my friends really wanted to eat there so we waited. The whole time we waited there was a table big enough to sit all of us we were told that a group made reservations for 7 o'clock (we were there at 6 and had tried to make reservations). After waiting an hour guess where they sat us.  That's right at the table that had sat empty.  For the price the of the meal not worth it.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

That place are wilrd. I got expelled because I get there with food from other place and I did ask if is a problem.So, a manager get upset when he saw and make me get out that place. I don't recommend anyone to go there. With/out food from other place. Humiliate situation, totally unnecessary. And on top on that, I spoke with the general manager and nothing happened.  So don't go there.</Review>

<Text>Went to the yard house on Friday for a little date night with my boyfriend. We were looking foward to a steak dinner before a movie. We got seated very quickly but then we waited and waited and waited. We watched a waiter introduced another waiter to the people seated in front of us because he was going on a break.  We thought the new waiter was going to make his way to us but didn't.  Then we saw a waitress take drink orders from the people sitting behind us and thought maybe we were sitting at her table but nothing we couldn't even grab anyone's attention to ask what was going on so after 20 minutes we just got up and left.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

A tad pricey for food, but the bar tenders like Mellie always treat you great. They offer a TON of different beers on tap with seasonal beers always rotating in. They have TVs everywhere, often showing games and races, so it's a great place to catch your team and enjoy a fun atmosphere.<//text>

We were looking foward to a steak dinner before a movie. We got seated very quickly but then we waited and waited and waited. We watched a waiter introduced another waiter to the people seated in front of us because he was going on a break.  We thought the new waiter was going to make his way to us but didn't.  Then we saw a waitress take drink orders from the people sitting behind us and thought maybe we were sitting at her table but nothing we couldn't even grab anyone's attention to ask what was going on so after 20 minutes we just got up and left.<//Text>< Resp>

<review>That place are wilrd. I got expelled because I get there with food from other place and I did ask if is a problem.So, a manager get upset when he saw and make me get out that place. I don't recommend anyone to go there. With/out food from other place. Humiliate situation, totally unnecessary. And on top on that, I spoke with the general manager and nothing happened.  So don't go there.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Good selection of beers even if they seem to run out of them from time to time. Food it very good. Only complaint I have is the main room is a bit noisy. Outdoors is great but Fresno can be too hot for outdoor dining.</Review>

<Text>This bar/grill had an almost clubby atmosphere.  The music is distinctly too loud for the menu, because when I think thumping bass, I don't immediately go to "delicious seared Ahi tuna sandwich" in my head.  The calamari was great.  The beer list is extensive, and rich in sours, stouts and ales.  The cider list is a disappointment, but the earth stopped caring about hard cider about the same time Queen Victoria died, so I guess that's to be expected.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Can be quite crowded. The food is good but usually fairly expensive, likewise for the beers.</Review>

<Date>1516062038786<//Date><pictures>None< /pictures><text>Was ok. The food is trendy. It is loud with very low lighting. The renditions of well know dishes such as the california roll or fried mac and cheese were, while differnt, not exactly what you expect when ordering them. They were not bad per se but if you are looking fir familiar you will be disappointed. On the other had if you are looking for adventure this is your place. The beer selection while vast is not necessarily exotic. The waiting staff while very friedly and attentive were not very knowledgeable about the beers. That said if you sat at the bar the bartender may be extremely knowledgeable about what was on tap. It is npt quite my type of place i could see it being a great night out for a younger more trendy person. Either way i would encourage you to try and judge for yourself.<//text>< Response>

<review>Yard House is one of the most amazing places to eat and drink. Apart from the beer selection, which is vast, their cocktail menu is to die for!< /review>< pictures>

Great vegan selections, fun atmosphere. Food was a bit salty though, as were all of the dipping sauces that came with our various dishes.</Review>

I'm vegetarian, and this is one of my favorite restaurants. I've had a couple of bad experiences here. Once, I asked for shiitake mushroom garlic noodles, and I was given chicken garlic noodles. Another time, I asked for swordfish setup tacos substituted with gardein. I was not given gardein; I was given swordfish. Management has always been super professional, and it hasn't happened since. I'm a very happy customer.< /Text>

Well, this was my first date or going out in about 30+ yrs..been widowed for 2 yrs now..everyone from the hostesses to the waiters, to the food manager was great. They got my food order wrong, brought it back out with food manager saying on the "house"..asked a group of waiter/waitresses where restroom was..a waiter actually walked me to the restroom! and table waitress was very attentive not to mention the food was fabulous!   I'm not even a social drinker but was recommemded by a friend to try a cider or fruited beer...waitress said go witht the cider..tried the pear cider..it was light, crisp...excellent!  Will definately come back!  You guys know how to do things right!!!<//Text>

<Review>Very poor customer service, on 10-27-2013 I took my son there to celebrate his 21st birthday party. The waitress we were given was lousy in meeting our tables needs. I also gave her specific instructions not to mention that I bought my son a birthday cake, as he didn't want one.

There were three times we needed drinks at our table and we had to waive another waiter or waitree to get help at our table, during one of those times one of the persons told us to walk to the front counter and ask for assistance... I am so sorry I took him there....

Needless to say I contacted YH corporate office and gave them my complaint and concerns, they in turn sent me a gift card for 100.00 as it was considered a 21st bust birthday party, now since i got the gift card I returned there with my son two other occasions and both times the service did not change.

The upper management for which this store answers to seriously needs to address some major concerns and specifically how the staff are lousy there.

Part of giving me a gift card was to attempt to win my service or patronage there, and needless to say I am not impressed at all, nothing has changed...</Review></record></dataset><record>

Many many drinks to choose from if you're looking for something special in particular to alcohol and beer they have it or can make it as far as food goes I rate it two stars the entrees are not very good but the restaurant shines and it's appetizers and drinks< /Text>
