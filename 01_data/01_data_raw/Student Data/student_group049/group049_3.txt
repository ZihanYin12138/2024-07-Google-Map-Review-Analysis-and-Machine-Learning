Their pizza is so yummy!! Always fresh and always loaded with toppings. I like to get the vegetarian and add pepperoni. We're a family of four and each of us gets a personal size pizza which is the perfect size and it's so affordable.< /review>

Ordered takeout here a couple weeks back and can’t wait to order again. We tried the vegetarian pizza and it was delicious! My children loved there cheese pizza as well.

Service was great. Very friendly and order was made very quickly. Price is very reasonable for the size of pizza that you get. I have been on a huge pizza kick lately and I will definitely be coming back here soon! I would also refer them to anyone looking for a new place to try!< /text>

Best pizza place around in my opinion
The pizza is amazing. Especially the chicken bbq pizza. We always add artichoke to it but you don't have too. It taste Soo delicious even if you don't think you'll like bbq pizza give it try you'll be surprised. Also cheaper than some of the other pizza places near by like mountain Mike's and taste better.< /Text>

<Review>How this place has a 5 star rating is beyond me. California people have know idea how pizza should be. This pizza was floppy and had no crisp at all but most of all the pizza was soaked with grease. The inside top of box was saturated with grease as well as bottom of pizza. Typical average California pizza at best but with all the grease I will not be returning.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I came in an afternoon and was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful interiors. Gave me a good vibe with nice quotes all around, pleasant staff.
Now the food, my favorite was the breadsticks!! Would have to vouch for the quality of the bread and the consistent taste. Would definitely recommend and keep coming back!<//Review>

<Text>We ordered from here because of the reviews,  my family and i had 2 sandwiches and a small pizza. The pizza was amazing,  but the sandwiches were not that great. Barely any meat,  one Romain lettuce , it was a pretty sad sandwich. Glad we weren't that hungry. Will probly have to make something extra, because we're still hungry. Friendly service,  as well as our delivery. We spent $40 on our meal. Come on guys< /Text><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Meh at best. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are saying. I was quite disappointed in the pizza. Tasted like old dominoes.

I really wish I wasn't so bad at taking the pics, and that I had more pizza to share but we all scarfed it down so fast. The pizza here is amazing!! The crust isn't too buttery/airy nor is it too thick, the sauce is tasty not over or underwhelming, they are generous with their toppings, and their cheese is super stretchy. They are very comparable to certain other pizza chains that have a similar chicken bacon garlic pizza only their crust and toppings here are better. The prices are affordable. The staff are friendly as well which is a huge bonus! Also, family friendly and hangout friendly.</review>

I've lived in this area for 8 years.  I've tried 4 or 5 pizza places around here and I recommend this place to everyone.  It taste good and even the family that I've recommended it to asks for the name so they can find in their area.  The hours are good and the price is even better.<//text>

<review>Well these people don't care their customers. If the girl at the front wouldve worn a mask I could have felt safer. I truly don't care if people don't believe in covid but when coming into contact with people that truly care then they should care too as common decency. I truly fear for older people that might come into contact with them because they don't give a ****. The pizza was incomplete and it tasted meh.
Edit: The pizza was under someone else's name. The point of this review wasn't the pizza it was the carelessness of not wearing a mask. If you want to know how the pizza tasted it was average/ below average, a lot of cheese and bread and barely any of the ingredients listed on the menu if it wasn't for the issue of not following state orders then I would have left a 3 star review.<//review><Response>{'time': 1608521929837, 'text': 'Hello.

My family and I have eaten 701 pizza for months now.  Frankly, most pizza restaurants sell the same old cardboard pizza with cheap toppings and dough.
I found 701 entirely by accident.  Their pizza crust and toppings are fresh and numerous.  The cheese is plentiful as are the fresh toppings.  For the same price as those flavorless pizza pies, these pizzas are top shelf!  You owe it to yourself to try a real pizza meal, not a cheap pizza!<//review>

<text>The pizza is fantastic!! I've only had their chicken and garlic pizza but it's better than Round Table and not as expensive without sacrificing the taste/quality. I've only been there 3 times but each time I've never been disappointed!! The staff have always been friendly, I think it's a great place to go with a group of friends or with your family!! I can't speak highly enough of their pizza though...the crust, sauce, toppings...super tasty!< /text>< pics>

<Review>Love this place, their pizza is very delicious) Great atmosphere for pizza eating, the wall is also covered up in positive & motivational quotes.  I guess I have found my new favorite pizza joint. There, pizzas are made fresh to order, all ingredients are really good quility.  I would also want to mention ranch, because it was literally the best I ever tried. Ranches in other joints can not be even compared with 701 pizzas ranch :)

I would definitely recommend stopping in and trying their 701 pizzas, the staff are very friendly and I know we'll come back!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Bought puzza here 3 times and it seems like a decent place.
Friendly staff, great tasting pizza with lots of cheese.
Good size dining area which would fit 30-40 people, so you can definitely eat there if needed.
Their homemade ranch is free. And they offer thin and even ultra thin crust, if you like that.

I like to support local businesses, so I hope they're going to do well.<//Review>< userid>

Round Table claims they're the "last honest pizza". Don't believe it, Folks!

701 Pizza has them all beat! These people know how to make a pizza! We received an extra large pizza with plenty of toppings for less than $30 delivered. That includes taxes and a delivery charge. Ya'd better not expect that at Round Table.

We highly recommend 701 Pizza. The best in town!<//Review>

So far, so (very) good -- my years long search for a really good pizza reasonably close to my house has finally ended. I can get semi-decent pizza in my hood, but for really good stuff I found I had to go to midtown. 701 is as good as you can get there! I can tell all the employees are busting their humps to create excellent product and provide great, friendly customer service -- keep up the good work 701, if you do, I think you'll be *very* successful!< /Review>

I am a very picky pizza person and grew up with some amazing local pizzerias.  Since I have moved from San Jose to Sacramento, I have yet to find a "non-chain" national pizza joint that I liked.  Well, that stops here.  Delicious pizza.  I would rank it in the top 10 I have tasted to date.  I do prefer the New York flop pizza but this pizza has amazing taste and ingredients.  I think I found my local favorite!!</text>

The employees are friendly and will customize pizza to any extent all at a very fair price. Highly recommend to any party of people, as their dining room will comfortably accompany from a group of 2 to a group of 20.

Update: I've been going to this location for quite a while now and I pleasantly discovered that not only is the pizza great, but the subs, salads, breadsticks, and chicken pieces are all delicious. So a "pizza mood" is not necessary for enjoying a meal in 701 Pizza!<//Text><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Ordered delivery from here tonight for the first time and chose the Chicken Garlic speciality pizza. It was the worst chicken garlic I've ever had, if not some of the worst pizza I've had in general.. It was basically flavourless? I don't know how else to describe it.. I have had many chicken garlic pizzas from the surrounding area and have never taken a bite and been confused at how flavourless it was, especially with so many toppings on it. My girlfriend and I tried adding salt and dipping it ranch (which you shouldn't really have to do with white sauce pizza) and it was still very very bland. They even go as far as to claim they make the roasted garlic white sauce in house...if that's really true maybe you should just leave the "homemade" part out because it reflects very poorly on the chef, if there even is one for a value priced pizzeria.

It's my take that a lot of these reviews are fake. The grammer is horrible on most of them, and they usually mention things such as the decor on the inside of the pizzeria rather than the quality of the pizza? Many of them even said it was on the " Pricy side, but delicious " on the GrubHub reviews which makes absolutely no sense considering it's cheaper than pizza guys... Yet I am to believe these reviews are real..

On top of everything it arrived room temperature, which was why I thought it tasted bland initially, so we heated it up to proper temp in our oven after the first cold bite and it was still BLAND AS CARDBOARD.

Im really not one to be picky about cheap pizza, but please don't be fooled by the 4.9 star review, this pizza was worse than mediocre at best. Feel free to check my review history, I rarely leave reviews in the first place in the many many years I've had this account and they are almost always positive ones.

I will gladly update this review if the owners feel like the pizza I received was an anomaly and wants to make it right. Otherwise, just order from Pizza Guys if you want cheap pizza, at least it's flavorful.<//text>

<text>I had a wonderful time with my Dad and wife last night. July 16th. The restaurant is pleasant to the eye. We were welcomed by very friendly staff.  The pizza was very tasty as well as the salads that we ordered. The whole experience was exceptional. I asked my father what he thought. We both enjoy food alot. . So I know when he likes a restaurant or not. He simply responded " I'll Be Back." 5 star experience.<//text>< rate>

New favorite pizza place, spacious can fit a while crowd but at same time nice friendly at home atmosphere. Owners and employees are friendly.  Affordable price, pizza taste great, lots of toppings and choices. Buffalo wings are bomb.</review>

It used to be amazing but they changed so many things, they changed the pepperoni to the same stuff every other pizza place uses, the garlic bread was horrible, the pizza didn't  have the same amazing flavor as blondie's  did. They kept the high price and changed out the quality. We won't be coming back, time to find a new pizza spot, such a shame.< /text>< pictures>

I placed an order on 08-04-2020
They held onto the order to verify
I understand that it was a large order
However, no-one called nor email me to verify
I'm not sure how they do their verification, probably via snail mail
I finally realized we have no toners left and called them on 08-26-2020
They were able to ship the product out on 08-27-2020
I received it on 09-01-2020
It took them almost a full month to deliver my order

Today is 12-07-2020
I finally used up all their toners
Worst toners I've ever bought
The toners leave chalky black residue all over the inside my Lexmark Printers
One toner failed as soon as we stuck it in, Lexmark cannot recognize it

Overall I would not recommend this company.
They have sub-par customer service with sub-par products< /Text>

I’ve been using TomatoInk for years to by ink for my printers. They are trust worthy, have good products and shipping is quick. In all of the purchase transactions that I have done, only one time did my order arrive with one less toner than I bought. I called them, they apologized and shipped it immediately. They have very good customer service.</Review>

<Text>I just ordered for the first time from them.  It was surely a very quick process.  If you're in a rush, as was I, this is surely a nice surprise.  I'm tired of all the million forms to order something.  Ordering should be this easy. The prices are great too.  Including s&h.   I will now have to see how fast it ships.  If it ships quickly and I have no problems with the cartridge, I will have to return and update my rating from 4 to 5 stars.<//Text><userid>101061513283341933713< /userid>< response>

<review>I had a trouble finding where to place the discount code. Showerly (the customer rep) sent a picture of the page, making it idiot-proof...which I needed. We've used Tomato Ink for years and all-in-all been very happy. They've been quick to replace faulty cartridges. I know that Epson cartridges are very difficult to recycle... these folks do a good job.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Did not work well for my HP_ color laser printer.  I print custom invitations and thought these prices were too good to be true and I should have known.  Printed the colors poorly and not close to how they should look.  If this is just for casual printing, probably fine but not for anything that needs specific colors.< /Text>

Website is great and has tons of discounts. Also shipping is pretty fast. It says 2-10 days, and its usually closer to 2/< /text>

Ordered refilled ink cartridges.  Good price (half the price of new ones), good service, delivered in timely manner, and free shipping.  However when I installed in printer, it showed the color cartridge is low on ink. I don't print a lot, so will see how it lasts. I would recommend TomatoInk for your printer needs, but next time I will just pay extra for new cartridges.< /review>

Great quality replacement toner cartridges for my HP 400 series Laser Jet Pro printer. I have ordered from them 3 times for all colors now and my experience has been favorable. I had a problem with one cartridge and they replaced it with no issue.< /review>

This company saved me close to $20!! I was also able to find a coupon code to enter at check out which saved me an additional $10! For my canon printer, I was able to get black and color ink for $28...that includes $3.99 for shipping. I had no problem paying the shipping especially after the coupon code :)</Review>

Just so happened we needed more ink for our inkjet printer.  Buying at a regular store always costs way too much money.  Received a coupon to save $10 and stocked up on my ink needs.  Prices and selection is better than shopping at a brick and mortar store.  I will check here first before buying elsewhere again.<//review>

<Text>I was dreading the purchase of the ink cartridges because the ink is pricy! I happened upon Tomatoink while scrolling through a Brad Deals email. I'm so glad I clicked on the link! I was able to purchase two sets of replacement ink cartridges for the price of one set!! Great service, fast delivery, (had the order in less than five days), and the print quality amazing!<//Text>< pictures>

I have never had a problem with Tomatoink with either their inks, or their service.  I have ordered several times from them and one time from someone else.  The only problem I have had is with the ink from the other company I ordered from.  I will never go back!!  The prices at Tomatoink are every bit as good as one can get anywhere and their service is excellent.<//text>

Cannot ever reach customer service!  Called 3 times, every time said greater than 10 minute wait time.  I tried leaving voicemail for a return call, nothing.  Tried opening a ticket though our account online, nothing.  I used the online tracking, package returned to sender due to missing commercial invoice.  Trying to get a replacement package so our office doesn't run out of ink!  I M P O S S I B L E.  Worst customer service I have ever experienced.<//review>

I am giving this a 3- because when it first arrived, the package was shredded and i was missing 8 of the ink cartridges from my order. But- i was able to talk to customer service and they sent new ones out (received just a few days later). So they fixed the problem i had. I havent used the ink yet- so hopefully it will be worth my money!< /Text>

Hooray!  I no longer have to be an "Ink Nazi" (as my daughter has called me) since now that I've been using tomatoink we can print what we want and in the colors we want.  I have the best printer I've ever used and absolutely love it but the ink was nearly $20 per cartridge...and it takes 5 to print!!  But I just placed my third order with tomatoink and I realized I've still spent less with them ordering about 12 cartridges than 2 or 3 would've cost in the stores.  They always have great coupons and cheap shipping. I was worried at first but don't hesitate cuz the cartridges work exactly like the name brand ones...I've never had a leak or any issues with them and they last forever.  I'm stocked for a while now but as soon as I need more, this is where I'll be getting all my ink and paper from.  You can't find better prices on photo paper either...every size, every finish.  I especially love the lustre finish. I'm about to print a bunch of senior pictures so I'm especially glad to have this source.<//text>

<text>BUYER BEWARE! Did not work on my HP printer and DAMAGED it. They are selling FAKE cartridges. Now my printer will not even recognize a true HP cartridge.
DO NOT USE this company, or you will have to purchase a new printer just for saving a couple dollars.< /text>< Gmap_id>

When I came across this website, it was from brad's deals. Brad's deal had exclusive promotion codes for Tomatoink, so I checked it out and they had the ink for my Canon MX922 (ink is so expensive for this printer!). I brought one and it came in, however, I was scared it would not work. Well...it worked with my Canon printer! =] I definitely love this place! I will be ordering from this website a LOT more!!!!!< /Text>

My home printer ran out of black ink and I needed replacements fast. The online OEM I used before ran out of business and I google searched trying to find a new ink vendor when I stumbled onto TomatoInk's site. Their prices seemed too good to be true, especially compared to other vendors, but low enough for me to take the risk. So, I decided to place an order and see what I get. I am SO GLAD I did. TomatoInk delivered within a few days, the products were carefully packed and shipped, clearly labeled with easy to follow instructions. I was up and running in no time and printing out my documents. I have no idea where they came up with their funny name, but I am now a new customer and will be buying my  printer ink supplies from TomatoInk from now on.<//text>

<Text>I love the Mac & Cheese. The lemon pepper wings need to be crispier. The service is really S  L  O W ....Not sure why Mac & Cheese takes 45 mins to go. It's just ridiculous: the wait, the price, the wait some more. Love the Mac, though and the personalities of the staff. I just HATE the wait as you can tell by now....< /Text><GmapID>0x80857e7bd0267bb3:0x518c9d4222009c55</GmapID>< pictures>

WOW WOW WOW If you're looking for a great venue and a fabulous atmosphere to have an event or better yet a birthday party, well this is the place. Drea the owner is absolutely so amazing and such a professional to detail. She made life so great and less stressful for me. I didn't have to worry about anything that night. From the beginning of me planning my wife's surprise birthday party to it actually happening Drea was honest, upfront and gave me everything I needed to make this a unforgettable celebration. You got one chance to do it right and it was over the top. My wife  and all the guest were treated with respect and the overall staff were so professional and sweet. And let me tell you about the food...AMAZING, DELICIOUS, FRESH, SEASONED and the BEST. Trust me you will not be disappointed and you'll thank me later. ENJOY!!!!!!< /Text>

Ok food like the sliders...but they need to wash the carpets...they are all stained! That or change floors they would get more business if they invested a little in the place. I would turn this place into a modern sports bar and with great selection of beer, wings lots of wings. Make this the new wing place of the bay<//Text>

Excellent food.  Fun atmosphere, a bit loud vs a restaurant but it is a bar too. I don't drink alcohol so I can't rate that part, but they've gone straight to the top of my food list!<//text>

Lively on game day however, never purchase the middle booth (largest) on game day because you will not be able to see anything and management can't do anything about it!<//Review>

<date>1619720472137< /date><rating>5< /rating><review>We took our 4 month old for his first doggy day care today & we are so impressed! Mouse came back exhausted (which is rare for him & nice for us! 🤣), but we also received a wonderful tour of the facility & great explanations of everything that goes on while the dogs are there! We’re excited to see how Mouse does when he boards next weekend!<//review>< pics>

<Text>My little Emma Lue is 10 years old & in those 10 years, I have not found a groomer that I've been particularly fond of/trusted. I am delighted to say the wonderful people over at The Animal Keeper finally have changed that for me. The staff were incredibly friendly & accommodating. Emma came back to me looking like a rock star & the price was fair & better than I was expecting. Thank you, Kristina & Team - Emma & I will definitely be back!</Text>< pictures>

The team at Animal Keeper makes me feel like my Dillon is the BEST fur angel.  They take my calls when he’s boarding with them and gladly check on him and give me a real time update.  My cat comes home looking pretty chill and showing no signs of stress.  I hate that I can’t always take him with me but find comfort in knowing he’s someplace that is attentive and kind and generally seems to adore him 😻</review>

I am so impressed with the facilities of Animal Keepers-Poway.  Daniel, the manager, gave me a tour of the facilities.  They were spotless--the kitchen, laundry room and boarding facilities.  Altho hesitant to keep my little precious in another facility, I know she is getting the best possible care and that makes me happy.< /text>

We love the Animal Keeper!  It was recommended to us by friends who have been taking their dog here for daily doggie daycare.  We have a 7 year old boxer, Dozer, who is great with people, not so great with other dogs. Doggie day care at the Animal Keeper has been a game changer for him.  His first day was a little rough (he needed private time because he was being a bit aggressive).  On his next stay, we actually boarded him for a night, and then requested doggie day care the following day.  He did great!  And he's been going one a week since then for the past 4- 5 months.  The staff there is super friendly and caring, and we always feel that Dozer is in good hands.< /review>

<review>Groomers are amazing and staff outside with animals are great! That is the only reason I did not give this place a 1 star. THIS IS NOT A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR EMPLOYEES OR ANIMALS. Do not bring your pets here. Employees are not valued and safety is disregarded. Animals constantly fight and need to be seperated. Instead of communicating with Owners that their pets are not doing well (i.e, they are sick, have upset stomachs, have anxiety that leads to aggression towards employees or they fight with other dogs so much that the dog doesn't even go out to the yard)  management hides these occurrences to keep profit coming in. That is all families are to this company, profit. There is a tip jar that is supposed to be divided amongst employees that is not! The staff does their best to maintain a happy environment but behind closed doors, the staff is degraded and devalued. DO NOT BRING YOUR PETS HERE.< /review>< Pictures>

As my first time hearing about animal keeper and boarding my dog I was very skeptical. I assumed it was just like the rest . I’m so beyond pleased with this place . They went above and beyond with trying to help me with every need every question I had . Every single person that works there clearly loves animals and cares for the pups . It was also  so nice to receive a report card at the end of your stay . Absolutely so thrilled to have found a place to leave my baby whenever I’m out of town .< /review>

I could not have found a better place for my doggy. The staff is beyond amazing: kind, and they love animals and understand they are our babies. They are so patient and caring. I know my doggy is at the best possible place when he is not with me. The first thing that struck me is how well kept, clean and organized the facility is. This is by far the best and besides affordable day care for our pets.< /text>

Highly recommend Animal Keeper Poway! My dog is an absolute hot mess and can't be alone during the work day, so she's a daily "camper" at the Animal Keeper. I am so relieved that my girl has a great place to hang out during the day. All of the staff are friendly, lovely, and professional and they give my dog great nicknames. Trainer Justin is a pro at dealing with all of my girl's myriad of emotional issues, and we would definitely go through them for training of another dog if need be. Thank you Animal Keeper for my daily peace of mind and so lovingly caring for my crazy dog. She's always excited when we pull up, always has the best care, and always comes home happy and healthy.< /text>

My puppy so far loves Animal Keeper and refuses to leave every time we pick him up! We like that they’re keeping him with the smaller dogs and that they have staff onsite watching them all the time. Great socialization experience for him and always come home exhausted. A tired puppy is a good puppy!< /Text>

<Review>I couldn't have been more happy with the services of The Animal Keeper. The entire staff was wonderful and in particular Patti who promptly replied to my initial inquiries and guided me through the pet sitting process. And my request was no easy task, as I needed someone whom I could trust to care for fish and aquatic plants. The staff worked as a team to care for these fish and the fee for their services were fair. 'Couldn't recomend The Animal Keeper more and I am happy to know who to turn to for my next trip out of town.< /Review>< userid>

It was our 1st time using The Animal Keeper for our cat, Rose. I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and their reassurance that they would provide great care for her over the 1-week boarding. I called after 2 days to check on Rose and they were able to give me a summary of how she was adjusting and again reassured me. When we picked Rose up, one of the young women that worked there said, “We just LOVE Rose!!!” We were given a report card that gave a summary of her experience.  Rose got an A+!!! (Now if only my son could get such a raving report card from school!) Honestly, these are great people who seem to like their jobs, love animals, interact well with customers, and keep the place nice and clean.  We were so happy that we made reservations for Rose to board there for our upcoming trip to Europe!<//Review>

An easy, pleasant experience. I can’t tell if my dog enjoyed it but he seems clean and happy after two nights without us. One point deduction is for the price. Maybe it’s the market rate here in San Diego but where we used to live dog boarding cost a lot less. Just checked with a friend they’re still paying $20/night for their GSD at Coventry pet resort in Redlands.< /Review>

I have been using the animal keeper since I moved to California in 2000. I have had 3 different dogs stay there and have always been very satisfied. We now have lost our 16 year old Boarder Collie mix, and have a Yorkie.  Totally different needs for these two and I have been equally happy with the care of both.  We have also boarded my sons Chihuahua/rat terrier with them.  Additionally, I have recommended them to our neighbors for their yellow lab..... I would not hesitate to recommend this facility.< /Text>

The first time I boarded my pets Ty and Axel they seemed to be treated well and all wagging tails. The staff seemed nice. However after 9.days my Axel came out trembling which is not a good sign. It has been almost a week and he is still too afraid to approach people which never ever was an issue in the past. It is highly unusual. When I called to ask if reports were still given it seemed to be a problem for the worker to give to me. I also explained to Sierra that I was told the rate for the daily play was $20. I even confirmed that was the rate when I called while on vacation and that person also confirmed it was $20, but I was charged $23. When I questioned this the response Sierra gave was oh yes it is just $6 more. Well the bill being $647 to $816. There is an additional charge for everything! The issue I really have is that when I wanted to speak to a manager Sierra once again was on the phone with more attitude. I asked to speak to a manager and ahe asked what it was regarding. I said my dogs' stay and she answered, "What about it?" With as much attitude as she could give. I decided to call the Encinitas office and spoke to Stephanie who assured me the General Manager would be in touch with me rearding the matter. Good thing I did not hold my breath! I still have not heard from anyone who owns these places. The least they could do was have the person call me. I did hear back from Lindsey at the Poway location where the inexperienced Sierra worked. She apologized for the mistreatment. I am not sure why my dog was not eating while there and is now more frightful of people than he ever has been and was shaking like a leaf when I picked him up. I know he experienced something. I have boarded him and know when he has had a good stay and when he has not. This was definitely not a good stay for Axel and I.will not be boarding my pets here again. Empty promises of calls from the top, rude associates and my dog who came home 5 pounds lighter leads me to think something is amiss. Tale of the Dog is where dogs are treated well and you never have to worry.</review>

My dog, Banshee, needed some regular dog socialization after we adopted her. We did the initial "personality test" to make sure she'd be a good fit for the general crowd, and after sending her to the Animal Keeper's day camp a few times, her confidence is noticeably up, she's really come into her own, and she now doesn't go crazy when she sees other dogs on our walks together. This regular exposure to dogs in a positive and supervised environments has done wonders for her calmness, and the camp counselors and staff remember each dog by name and habits and can give me a progress report on how she's interacting. Our boarding experience here has been absolutely amazing, too! I feel completely confident leaving my precious pup in their care, and their facility is very clean and comfortable. We're so lucky to have such an amazing facility with so many different services available here in Poway.<//Text>

Our German Shepard spent 8 days recently at the Poway site..... and apparently had a good time. The folks taking care of the animals appear to really care about what they are doing. No complaints and a highly recommended place for boarding your dog. We will use the again without hesitation.< /text>

I took my 6 month old Belgian Malinois here while we were out of town for 4 days. I elected to purchase the sports package that would allow her to play outside all day. The staff is extremely friendly, has great recollection of each animal there (they knew her by name) and made me feel very comfortable leaving my baby for her first time. They even told me I could call and check on her any time and I did for sure. It has been raining over the weekend and I expected to pick up a somewhat stinky dog because I did not opt for the bath or spa treatment but she smelled amazing like grapes when I picked her up (I am thinking they use those bathless dog wipes maybe?). She was very happy when I picked her up and tired for the first time in her life. (If you have a Belgian you know what I mean) we will definitely be a returning customer!< /Text>

The Animal Keeper has been our go-to for boarding and also doggie day camp for our Cavalier. The staff is always very friendly - even willing to come outside and get my dog when I have my kids in the car. They know my dog by name even though we only come in once or twice a month and the facility is always very clean. Highly recommend.</text>

I have signed the contract to drop my dog off for 22 nights boarding in which my dog would get every other day of tiny tot camp during her boarding. However, on the day prior to boarding day, we paid for her try out at the tiny camp, she was a little over tired when we picked her up. So I spoke with the staff and determined that my dog would still have every other day of exercise, but half of the times would be at the tiny tot camp ($22/day), and half of the time would be a 1 hour play ($12/day). After 22 days, when I picked her up, I was charged for 12 days of tiny tot camp. In fact, I should be charged 6 days of tiny tot camp and 6 days of 1 hour play. I was too jetlag after my such a long flight to deal with it. So I paid $1,056 for the bill. On the next day, I called and explained the situation to the staff, she put me on hold, then came saying that my contract was locked due to the corporate monthly closing. She will have the Manager to call me back on Monday. When the manager (Lindsey, I believe that's her name) called me back she said "I heard you want to talk to me", then I explained the situation with her again. She told me that she was kind of know the staff that did my contract, and that she will have that person called me back on the next day. I waited for 3 days, then I called the store again asked to speak to Lindsey, but she was not there. A few minutes later, Lindsey called me back and apologized for not having someone to called me as promised because they were busy due to Easter, holiday..bla bla. She then proceeded to ask if I remember the name of the staff who prepared the contract for me. I didn't believe that she asked me that again, so I described the lady with a bit of reddish/dark brown hair, and I said that I would know her when I go to the store again. But then Lindsey told me that she want to offer a free activity for my dog on the next time my dog stop by because the staff did not put the right info. on the contract. I told her that I would like to give her more time to talk to her staff about the contract and get back to me later. She told me that "no, I already talked to my staff and there is nothing like that on the contract". I said "OK, thank you", and I am deeply disappointed at how the story resolved the problem. I can't believe how a corporation can run a store like this.</Text>

Many of us take our breaks in the cattery and when we see a sweet kitty beckoning to us for affection, we can't help but appease them with lots of pets and scritches. No pet in our care goes starved of their desired attention. Thank you again. We look forward to your kitty's next visit!"}< /Response>

I despise the 1 star reviews.  I am the neighbor (Rundlett & Associates) across the street.  I would know more than anyone as I eat my lunch overlooking the operation.  This place is amazing.  Keep up the good work!</Text>

We feel they really care about taking care of our dogs when we board hem. My kids were sad to leave our dogs but we got to take a little tour of the facility and see where our dogs would be staying, and that made my kids feel better!</Review>

Glad we found this place. Everyone there are dog people and it shows in all that they do. We've dropped our fuzzy guy off for doggy day camp a few times and he always comes back tired and happy. Also used them for boarding and again it was a positive experience.<//text>

We board our cat here and it's always been a positive experience. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. Prices are very fair and they don't try to milk you... e.g  I dropped off on Friday AM, picked up on Sun 1pm. They could have charged me three days, but only charged two. Highly recommend this place.< /Text>

I brought my cat here while away on a Cruise. At first I was really nervous since my cat has some health issues and had never stayed at a pet hotel or boarding facility before. Usually we have a pet sitter but they fell through a week before we had to leave. But now we have a permanent place we can bring her when we go away and know she is in good hands. I called the first few days to check in on her and they always gave us detailed information on how she was adjusting, eating etc. everyone there was so helpful, caring and accommodating. We will definitely be using the Animal Keeper in Poway for future needs. Thank you!!!! 😁😸🙏</text>

professional and caring staff. ask to take notes on your dog's playtime experience. can customize with own food, toys, etc. used them periodically over the years with big and small. mini-poodle, recently rescued, happy and exhausted after daycare pickup (may switch to 1 hour play because he's intense runner).< /text>

As far as pricing goes, we understand that boarding stays can add up for long visits. We just want you to know that we do research on our pricing and set our costs competitively with other busy large capacity boarding facilities. We check everyone's prices every year to make sure we aren't overpriced compared to others. If your pets stay together, we do have a multi-pet discount were the 2nd pet gets 10% off the boarding rate. We also occasionally have specials with a free night of boarding on offer. You can check our website http://theanimalkeeper.com/ to see if we have any deals happening. Thank you again for your review."}< /response>

<Text>Coworker went there, the report card they give you seems to be a scam. Scared him off from them because his dog's paws smelled like pee when he picked him up one day.

I figure it's probably like any other dog daycare place. I think it was like 23 dollars for all day, 13 or something for half day (up to 6 hours).

If your dog is big and confident, they let the dogs hang out as a pack in this outdoor area. I thought it was cool, until I walked too close to the fence and they all started barking at me, all 20 dogs during the day...< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

We used this place multiple times for day care. Last few times we noticed some deep dog bites/cuts on our dog. One time we needed to take him to the vet and have some stitches done. The people in the daycare did not even notice that he was bleeding until we picked him up. The last time he had a cut on his face and they just said that our dog is playing too rough. He is very friendly and playful and we never had any problems with him when we go to dog park. So, I am not sure what are these people doing there but we will not take our dog there anymore.< /Review>

I boarded my dog, Buddy, over the weekend, from Friday, August 2 through Monday morning, August 5.  When I picked up the dog I was given a “report card” that talked about what a sweet dog Buddy was, etc.  Everything on the report was positive.

I waited for quite some time for the attendant to retrieve Buddy.  In fact, while I waited two other clients came, retrieved their dogs, and left.

When Buddy was delivered to me, he was clearly upset.  He would not let the young lady near him to change his collar and put on his leash.  He growled at her whenever she came near him.  The young lady also told me about the “smell” of Buddy, and said it was because he was so upset.  She mentioned that sometimes she had to use a pole to reach the dog and pull him out of the cage.  I assume she was talking about Buddy.  She also told me that Buddy would probably “not board well” in the future.

I put the collar and leash on the dog, and we left.  Once in the car, he immediately began to settle down, and began to return to his own personality, which is friendly and playful.

I firmly believe that the dog was mistreated at this facility, and was possibly abused.  I have no proof of that, but am a pretty good judge of character.  Unfortunately, being caught off guard and by surprise, I do not have the name of the young lady, but do recall what she looked like.

I recommend avoiding this place.< /Review>

After the rave reviews, I was excited to try this place out for breakfast. I was disappointed...I ordered the quiche which came out slightly colder than room temperature and roasted potatoes which had obviously been cook hours before and then poorly reheated.<//Review>

This location gets 2 stars instead of their deserved 1 star because at least they’re a Starbucks location with mobile order, drive-through, etc.

However, the only thing this Starbucks is consistent at is getting orders wrong. Employees here try to do two or three things at a time, which inevitably means they make mistakes.<//text>

I don't like this place, as it's almost always crowded. It's not like I always come here, but every single moment I decide I want to have some overpriced coffee, I have to wait at least 15 minutes to get my drinks. Other than that, the beverage is fine.</review>

If you order thru mobile app pick up you will still wait another 10 mins to make your drink even though it says give us 4-8 mins...will usually have 3 people only one would be making drinks the other 2 either just talking or hanging out,if you wanted a special way made then probably they won't do it becAuse they dont really read the print out paper.< /review>

Not what I would have expected from a Starbucks. Could have been the time of day, but it was messy and not very well lit. Seems to be lacking that coffee shop vibe that all other Starbucks have.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) They are very irresponsible and mocking, today April 18, 2017 we went to buy 2 coffee by drivethru and the person did not close the lid of the coffee and burned my sister's hand, and gave them a lot of laugh even looking at my sister crying in pain

(Original)
Son muy irresponsables y burlones, hoy 18 de abril de 2017 pasamos a comprar 2 café por drivethru y la persona no cerró bien la tapa del café y quemó la mano a mi hermana, y les daba mucha risa aun mirando a mi hermana llorando de dolor</Review>< Rating>

They did not take my dog in they just grabbed him with a disgusted face and said “where are. The papers” I handed the papers and she just gave him back to me and said he was to hard to do.so the next day I woke up at 5 am because I live in Moreno Valley and got there by 6 and they still did not take him when I had all the papers.<//Review>

<Text>They got my nervous dog stoned on cbd so he'd calm down enough for them to give him a nice haircut. They didn't rush it or make him scared. They took their time and we appreciate that very much. We are very pleased and will be taking our other dog there soon. 😁👍</Text><user_id>117659534769688508213< /user_id><Date>1581717106147< /Date><Name>JJ THELIVER<//Name></record>

<text>I have been bringing my Pomeranian since she was a puppy, she is 6 years old now. I never had any bad experience. They have great communication, the location is always clean, and most importantly my Pomeranian gets excellent treatment.<//text>< user>

*This review is strictly based off the customer service*

I just got off the phone with an employee and she was extremely helpful! She took the time to answer all of my questions without making me feel rushed (though I'm sure they were busy with all the misc. noises in the background), suggested the best times to bring in my dog who's very skittish around people, and explained processes that I didn't understand. Thank you H, I can't wait to bring in my fur babies! :-)< /Text>

I am so happy to finally find our hometown Groomer! They are very kind and personable.  My little dog seemed to be just fine when picking her up. The gals did an awesome job our pet. We look forward to going back for our next bath and tidy! Thank you so much!< /text>

We have had Paula and the Mobile Grooming truck come to our house for our 18 lb cat, Spot, for well over a year now. She has done wonders with him when no other groomer could. Previous groomers had actually asked us not to bring Spot in again. Spot came to us as an adult rescued cat. He is a good kitty but he is easily frightened. Paula has the phenomenal ability to calm him and manage him kindly and effectively. We are forever grateful for her compassion and her skills. His long thick fur tends to get matted if he isn't groomed properly. She does an excellent job and somehow even gets a bow on him. The mobile grooming approach coming to our home keeps Spot calm and is worth every penny. We highly recommend Paula and Riverside Pet Grooming.<//text>

The staff at Riverside Grooming were fast, efficient and friendly. My pet was handled with the utmost care. I felt like the staff truly cared about my dog. He had a pleasant experience and came home stress-free from his first visit to a grooming shop.< /Text>

<Text>I brought my dog in, in an embarrassing condition, he was a mess. They didn't make me feel like a horrible pet owner. My dog, who has separation anxiety, didn't make a peep the entire time I left him there. They did such a great job on his haircut. I waited more than 24 hours to leave this review, because I usually find nicks or scrapes... Nothing, they were very careful and my Maltipoo is happy and comfortable. Thank you, we'll be back.</Text><resp>{'time': 1555249173637, 'text': 'Your very welcome Tiffany! We try our best to keep all our customers pets as comfortable as possible.'}</resp>< gmap_id>

My first appointment was last July with my five year old Golden. I had a handful of bad experiences at Petco that management was unwilling to remedy and other groomers near me were without consistent favorable reviews. I found Riverside groomers and took a leap of faith. I was so incredibly pleased with their friendliness, customer service and results. My pup looked great and he was treated so well. I visited again yesterday, 2/23/18, and I can say happily they are 2 for 2.   I will definitely be back and encourage you to try them out. They are beginning to earn my full trust with my dog. Thanks for the great service Ladies!</review>

<text>Great service. My dog was very nervous since we never really took him to the groomers (except like 2 times when he was a pup). The girls were great and very helpful. They seemed very knowledgeable and tried to relax my dog. He was very happy and smelled so good when he came out. He had a whole new happy look compared to how frightened he was when he first went in. Reason for 4 stars is because they almost overcharged me. I had been told a flat rate when he came in and when I was going to pay, I was told way more. They had confused my dog for someone else's. Other then that, great and friendly service! I appreciate the groomers for taking care of my fur child.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
My Englishbulldog has been groomed here about 3 times and it's an ok grooming shop. The workers are very friendly and communicative.  The only thing I dont like is that they don't clean my dogs tail correctly. If you're a bulldog owner you know that it is very important to keep their tail clean and dry. This place fails to realize that not all breeds are the same.</Review>

I have had experiences with dog groomers who will always cut Roxy's nails to short to the point where she bleed and she is now terrified of having her paws even touched.

10 Star Service Bar None. We Had Our Dog Sunny Groomed for the 1st Time at Riverside Grooming. I was a little nervous because she is a special dog that requires special attention. When I dropped her off I felt totally confident that she would be taken care of. When I picked her up she was like a new dog. We are very Happy with the services provided by Riverside Grooming and we will have our other animals groomed there as well. We will be Back!</Text>

I took my golden doodle here first thing in the morning with no appointment, after my mom recommended them to me since I was visiting from Bakersfield for the weekend. Having no appointment made it extremely convenient for me while travelling. My overly fluffy dog jumped in the pool and then of course rolled in the dirt. Place did great, wish we had a place like this in Bakersfield that we can just bring them in without an appointment and expect quality care.<//review>

We took our Pomeranian mix, Maggie, here just to get her nails cut. They were out of control and were really bothering her. She was nervous when she went in but she felt great when she was all done. And my mother saw one of the staff that was treating her give her a kiss on the head. That was so sweet! We'll be back here with the rest of Maggie's furry family to get groomed soon!</Review>

As a former groomer myself, I am extremely picky about the work done on my pets and very selective about who I trust to care for them.  My cocker spaniel looks beautiful after his haircut and my house is SO much cleaner after I took my shepherd mix in for the deshedding service.  On top of outstanding service the staff at Riverside Grooming is also friendly and very knowledgeable.  I was also very impressed with the high quality, gentle products they use.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs some TLC for their pet!</review><Name>Crystal O'Conn<//Name>< GmapID>

<Review>Our Shih Tzu Cleo is 9 years old with a skin condition that came with her aging,  Riverside Grooming got her more clean and fluffy than anyone else we have taken her to in years.  She was trimmed up nicely and just as cute as button.  It has been several days and the odor she normally reacquires soon after grooming has not returned,  The price was reasonable and the people that work there are very friendly.
We are happy customers.

Desheading process offered is a total scam! I took my lab/poodle mix Luke who is shedding to be trimmed. The owner explained that he does not recommend shaving dogs with two coats and could stop 90% of hair using their desheading process. I explained if his hair was still coming out with light petting I would not be happy. I was told he would be ready in 3 hours and they would call. An hour later they called and said he was ready. I initially believed the process had worked after petting his back and paid the $65. I continued to pet him and lots of hair was coming from his neck. I asked if they could brush him some more. The manager said that it would irritate his skin too much. At this point I was the one who was irritated! I asked to speak with owner and he agreed to brush him. The groomer came to the front and removed several hand fulls of hair from his neck.
When I asked him to be shaved the manager told me it was a two stage process and gave me. a voucher for "free" desheading. When I returned in two weeks she told me that it would cost $50 to bathe him but the desheading was free. I then returned home disgusted. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced! I brushed my carpet with pet hair brush when I first took him and then again in 2 weeks. There was not any less hair after desheading process.< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>DO NOT TAKE YOUR PET HERE!!!!!!!!!!! First off, they are extremely rude to their customers and treat the animals poorly! I take my dog in and bathe him myself, and while I was in the washing area, a little bulldog who was soaking in a tub appx 4 feet off the floor was not being supervised by a groomer and fell out of the tub onto the floor!! NIGHTMARE!! The groomer seemed less than concerned for the dog's well being, and simply placed him back in the tub.

I am not entirely sure who the owners of this business are,  but it is obvious that this pkace is ran poorly. There are a bunch of teenie boppers working there who would rather gossip and make fun of the dogs that they are suppossed to be grooming than ACTUALLY doing their job and grooming the animals.

To say the least, I am never setting foot in that sorry excuse for a groomer ever again.</review>< pictures>

The food was delicious, I had a Chile Relleno, Rice and beans. One of the friends I dined with had Cheese Enchilada, Tamale, rice and beans, While another had a Taco, Chile Relleno pot beans and rice. the prices were great, $5.99 for a 1 item combo. I think the 2 item combo was $7.50. The employees were very friendly and attentive. They also have party platters.</Text>

This is a great place to eat, very reasonable prices and the portions are perfect, you don't get over stuffed with a lot of food just satisfied. My husband says they have the best Chile rellano and I always order the crispy shredded beef or ground  meat taco which is very good.  The only thing is that the chips are not complimentary it's  $2.50 or so for a very small bowl of chips. Other than that it's a great place to eat.</Text>

I ordered over the phone! Chile verde dinner, asada dinner and a 2 corn tostada ala carta. $31 and change!!!!! So I called back and said why so much? Told tostada bowls are so much. I said I ordered corn tostada. When I arrived for my order the lady Claudia tells me. " Next time when you order, know what your ordering cause then we have to throw the food away!" I told her. " Well everywhere I go a tostada is a corn flat tortilla, not a flour bowl! That's a taco salad! Believe me it took all I had not to let her have it and leave the food! Never going back!!!! Don't go if you don't want to be told things in front of everyone!  We owned a restaurant and I would leave allow this!<//review>

Summary: Don't let the authentic decor fool you.  Nothing is what it seems.  When you walk in, you must order at a counter and seat yourself.  When the food arrives, you'll be unimpressed.

Detailed review:

Ordering: when we arrived we were impressed with the authentic-ish Mexican decor but soon realized that was about authentic as it was going to get.  We encountered the chattiest (and loudest) waitress loudly joking with a cook, who took our order.  After ordering, she handed us two drink cups (I ordered a bottle of water).  Assuming the second drink cup was for ice for my bottle of water, my wife grabbed the cup and began filling it with ice.  The waitress actually wanted the cup back and told us she normally charges for the cup. (Wtf?!) As my wife reluctantly handed over the cup, I stopped her and said "too bad, she handed us the cup and now I want it."

Meal:  my wife ordered taquitos (ala carte) and I ordered the chile verde dinner.  The waitress returned and served us within 2 minutes if sitting down.  (Fast = pre cooked). It immediately became clear that the taquitos were store bought frozen, microwaved and served with cheese and freshly chopped lettuce and tomatoes.  The chile verde quickly became apparent that the meat was CANNED, not fresh.  Not even cooked last week - CANNED!  The beans had a bit of a sour aftertaste (possibly mixed in with old beans) and they too suspiciously tasted canned.  The rice was made there, but tasted a day old and reheated in a microwave.

Pluses:  in this mess I found the best damn guacamole I've had in years, and the sauce (chile) used to make the chile verde, was damn good.  They obviously make the salsa themselves and add it to their dishes and guacamole --

Verdict:  if you want fast and tasty (as least for the chilito they serve), then this is for you.  If you expect REAL comida Mexicana hecho fresco y a mano, go somewhere else.  Oh, and if you HATE paying for canned meat and frozen primary ingredients, then this isn't the place you!

We won't be returning.<//review>

<Review>Great taqueria! Fast and fresh food. Very clean dining area. Awesome salsas and burritos. It gets really busy during lunch rush so try to beat the crowds by going a little earlier or later.

This is my favorite burrito place in the mission.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1610213033081, 'text': "Thank you Terry!!!! I'll share you comments with the culinary team"}<//resp><gmap_id>0x80daf7afbcb0a15d:0x610f692baae66f32< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Consistently exceptional service and good food. The price is a little higher than some of the other buffets available in the valley, but I think you definitely get your money's worth for it. Plates are cleared and drinks refilled quickly. Food selection may not be as large as say, Morongo, but there's still more than enough to get 3+ plates and still not have repeats on food. Plus the dessert selection is great and all of it is good. I've been with family for both the Prime Rib dinner and for a regular dinner and both occasions were great experiences. I'd actually recommend going on the regular dinners: you save 5 bucks a person, it's not as busy, and they still have strip loin from the carving station so you're not totally without a solid meat option.< /text>< GmapID>

We went for dinner on a Monday.  Price was $20 each.  Many options including various salads, medium cocktail shrimp, prime rib, roast turkey, Chinese, Mexican & Italian selections.  Quality is commensurate with price.<//text>

It's one thing to have a buffet,  it's another to have a buffet with this much variety.  Add to that with the high quality of the food. And the topping on all of amazing recipe, is the amazing and friendly staff.
Asian- covered
Italian- covered
American- covered
Veggies- covered
And of course...the sweets, soooo many options, and sugar free options.
All high quality.
If you leave here not stuffed is your own fault. Good food here!< /Text>

The staff are always friendly and prompt to remove plates and ask one if one desires refills for drinks. The only reason I do not give it a 5 star is because the price is a little to high considering that the competition offers similar quality food for a lower price. Would recommend to try at least once.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>the food was delicious.  Unfortunately the smoke from the guests smoking in the casino was unbearable and we had to leave soon after. We couldn't enjoy our meal and felt like we were rushed to get out because of the smoke. Otherwise the quality of the food was very good. Too bad I cant return.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

We go to this buffet quite often but I will not ever return here again. The service is always great and staff is friendly but last night, my bf and I were eating here. I started with a salad and then went back to the "Mexican food" area for some jalapenos and there was a cockroach crawling along the side of the rice!! At first, I thought it was a fly, so I waved my hand to make it go away but I soon realized it was definitely not a fly. I looked over to the right and there was another one crawling up the counter. I rushed back to our table to tell my bf that there were roaches on the food!! He wanted to see for himself so I took him back to where I saw them but they weren't there anymore. We walked around and sure enough, as we were standing in front of the chocolate fountain, a roach was crawling on the floor towards the counter. I felt so sick to my stomach. I asked for a manager and explained what I saw. She did not seem shocked to say the least. She apologized multiple times and said thank you for letting me know where you saw them. She also offered us a free meal for next time. I told her we would absolutely never eat here again and wanted our money back. She refunded us without incident. Did it matter where we saw them? They were roaches, if I saw 3 within 15 minutes of being there then they are everywhere!! She should have asked everyone to leave and refunded them and fumigated immediately. There was obviously an active roach infestation. I now wish I would have taken pictures but I was so disgusted and just wanted to get out of there. I have since contacted the casino via email and waiting for a reply. I was and still am so disgusted. Yuck!!!< /Text>

The food and service is above average for a casino buffet but if you go in the summertime, make sure you bring a fly swatter. The flies are numerous and vicious.... impossible to enjoy your meal. This happens every year during this time and management does not seem to care to do anything about it. I will not return to this casino only because of this unsanitary issue.</Text>

This is one of the better buffets that I have been to. The food is rich and good. There is lots of variety. They even have a chocolate fountain. The service is good and friendly. It is only a couple of hours away from Los Angeles but it is definitely worth the drive. This buffet may be in the middle of the desert but it is definitely a good buffet. I highly recommend this buffet whether you are driving through or just want to go to a good place to eat.< /Review>

My husband and I visited Coachella Valley for a few days and decided on dining at the Fresh Grill Buffet for dinner, based on the Yelp ratings. We've dined at several casino buffets throughout So Cal and Las Vegas over the years. The overall presentation of the various dishes was appealing and all of the trays were amply stocked for guests to fill their plates. But I can only rate the taste of the food and variety of selection at the Fresh Grill Buffet as "average" (nothing to wow your palate). We did notice that the temperature of the hot dishes were tepid, and quickly lost all heat by the time we sat down to our table to eat our meal. The staff were friendly and quick to respond to our requests. However, although several staff stopped at our table to remove used plates and bowls, no one seemed to notice or bothered to ask if I wanted a refill on my drink (my glass of iced tea remained empty for nearly half an hour after we began our meal and stayed empty when we finished our meal and left the restaurant). Also, through no direct fault of the restaurant, it certainly would help guests enjoy their meals more if the casino ventilation was more effective in reducing the strong smell of cigarette smoke in the air. My sinuses were overly congested and eyes stung and teared a bit. I also noticed a man holding a handkerchief over his nose and mouth as he exited the restaurant to rush up the escalators to the parking garage.< /Text>

<UserId.>103844747975047690288< /UserId.><Review>The buffet is decent enough.  Dinner $20 and kids 3 and up at half price or $10 each.  (Children pricing seems high)  its ur Golden Corral rebranded, albeit a little better quality.  Prime rib was the highlight and good selection of American, Mexican, and cook to order pasta stations.  Dessert section is decent w several no sugar options.  In any case, underwhelms compared to ur LV buffets but for the area maybe its good.

I wouldnt go there again due to cigarette smoke.  When I called they said there is very little smoke and even outside seating but upon arrival, yes the casino floor smoke just as evenly distributed the cigarette smoke to the restaurant.  I was surprised at the number of kids there, not good to inhale second hand smoke like that.  I move to the outside tables but it was HOT.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Service both times gone is seriously lacking kids to busy talking joking in the back not paying attention to front, then when they do come out they act annoyed for being bothered. Then the orders are not correct.</Review>

Went for a meal after a long weekend at Chuckwalla Valley Raceway.

Surprisingly good prime rib, fresh creamy & chucky horseradishes, and tiramisu.

There are some hilarious items like Fried sesame chicken, but it was pretty satisfying for desert food.</text>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I didn’t even wanna give it one star.. so first I had an appointment at 3pm for new tires, I get here thirty min early.. didn’t get my car on a rack until a little after 4pm. And now it’s going on 6 pm and my car STILL ISNT READY. Not to mention we’ve sat here all this time roamed the parking lot and back.. SLOW CUSTOMER SERVICE. I’m starving, but I feel even worse for the elderly that has been here longer than me. Hearing one lady complain on how long she been here and she obviously tired it’s been four and half hours for her.. 😥😥😥 I’ll never do this again. Like don’t set appointment times if you can’t follow through I felt as if I should have been educated on the wait and I could have easily rescheduled if it was employee situations going on. The customer shouldn’t have to be punished for that.<//Review>

So happy to have found this tire shop. After searching around town, came across Ben who took excellent care of us and got us back on the road. As someone who knows about cars, I overheard several customer interactions where many auto shops would’ve attempted to take advantage of them and sell unnecessary services—NOT HERE. Ben provided honest feedback that was both informative and in the best interest of those customers. I would highly recommend this store for your tire & service needs.< /Text>

My horrible FOX rental car broke down on me the FIRST 3 HOURS of driving it on the I5-S!! I called Fox road side service and they recommended taking it here bc they have a contract with them and can give free diagnostics. It was also the closest so I had it towed here.

I called Firestone ahead of time and let them know I was on my way with the rental car, because they were closing soon. THANK GOODNESS FOR WERSTER, who told me he would wait for me even though we would arrive after closing time. I know he didn’t want to or have to wait for me, but I truly appreciate it because he saved the day. He took the rental car and securely towed it into their garage and took down my number so they would call me the next day. If it were not for Werster, I would have to stay the night in Bakersfield and lose a day of travel. THANK YOU AGAIN!

Next day, store manager Ben Provincio promptly calls to update me on the Fox rental car and that the problem was the alternator!! The rental car was ready for pick up. Ben was so nice and understanding. After all the headaches and drama with my Fox rental car, I was lucky to have outstanding and trustworthy service with Firestone.

THANK YOU AGAIN!< /review>

<Review>This crew saved my day!  We were driving down highway 5 near Buttonwillow when our vehicles dashboard lit up with overheating lights.  We pulled off the freeway and called AAA.  Was gonna get towed to the Jeep dealership in Bakersfield but the service department didn’t act like our situation was a dire one to get fixed today.  Found Firestone Auto Center and I explained to Ben my situation.  He said to come in and they would do their best to fix the problem TODAY.  Sure enough they located the problem and got me back on the road in under 2 hours.  Thanks Firestone Crew!  I saved your info as my favorites while in Bakersfield!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Traveling through town and brought vehicle in at 10am for a flat repair because I was told it would get taken care of in about an hour and a half. Turned out it needed a new tire instead, but here I sit three and a half hours later and the truck is still sitting outside the garage. Was told several times as I waited it would take about an hour, but it ended up being almost 4 hours. Mechanics seemed to be leisurely going about their work. Don't believe the  banner that proclaims "Right on Time."

Watching customer after customer enter without face masks, and sales people also not wearing any--even though it is posted on the door. No wonder California is having so much trouble getting a hand on the explosive spread of Covid-19.</review>

<Review>Absolutely phenomenal service. Gentlemen at the desk working to make sure you get the service you need at the best possible price! Brought my work truck in with a flat and with the insurance coverage he assured me there would be NO charge! Talk about shocked! I didn’t even know my work truck had coverage like that! He said he had 2 people ahead of me and would probably be a couple hours wait but he would make sure his tire guy squeegeeing me in between customers so that he help me back on the road and back to work ASAP!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea402d4b3223f3:0x7864e5d847409147<//Gmap_id></record>

<user>116729032014102717654<//user><rating>2<//rating><Review>I used to like coming here and trusting them with my car but after this last visit I'm not sure I will ever go back. I went in to have my wheel bearings checked because my car makes a loud road noise when driving and gets louder with higher speed. They couldn't pin point the noise and said my wheel bearings looked fine. I asked for my cabin filter and air filter to be changed. They didn't change them but told me after being there for three hours that they needed to be changed. Then driving home when I would step on the gas to accelerate quickly my engine was making this crazy loud noise that wasn't happening before I took it in. I got home and looked under my hood to see if there was something noticeable, found tools under my hood, but the noise still happens when I push on the gas to accelerate. I asked for an alignment too but my car pulls to the right now. I need to take it back so they can fix their mistake but not certain I want them touching my car again. 3 hours with an appointment, nothing fixed or replaced. Just a huge waste of my day. Not very pleased. They used to have way better service.</Review>< Gmap_id>

I called about my AC not working. I explained to the service writer that my compressor pulley froze up and burnt the belt off. He gave me a quote for a new compressor, condenser, belt, and a few other things. He explained they would have to do a diagnostics test first to make sure that was the issue. I was good with that. I took my truck down there on Friday at 2pm. I told him I would be there Saturday morning to pick my truck up with repairs done. I called on Saturday and was told they were still waiting on parts to come in. They told me it would be done by end of day on Saturday. I told them I would pick truck up on Sunday. I called Sunday to make sure it was done before heading down there. I was then told all parts were there and truck would be done by noon. I called at 12:15pm and was then told the mechanic refused to work on my truck. They could not give me a reason for this. I have taken several of my vehicles there for repair in the past with no issues. I requested to see manager, but he is on vacation. He gave me the district managers number. I called him that same day and left a message. Today is Monday 12:40 pm and no response. Very disappointed with this situation.
The store is on New Stine road in Bakersfield Ca. Store# 022705.< /Text>

<Review>Horrible service. I asked for an allignment correction. They made it worse and put my steering wheel off center. They also tried to upsell on things like filters that I had replaced at the dealer the previous week. When I asked if they had even looked at the filters they said that they did not check them at all. Their recommendation was based purely off the milage.

Don't go here if you have a choice. If you don't. Make sure you know what is actually wrong with your car and check the work was done right before you leave.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1581540024306, 'text': 'Hello David, we are sorry to hear of this alignment issue and would like to offer our assistance.

Bad service, long waits.
I have been a customer for 10 yrs.  Service has gotten worse as prices have increased. Appointments are a joke. They failed to check all fluid levels at my last visit and tried to upsell me on tires for a 20 year old car.  I got great tires at American Tire and better service for $220. less. Done with them.<//Review>

Poor customer service. Had a 1:00 o clock scheduled appointment to have a tire fixed. Manager knew i was going to be waiting from our conversation earlier that morning. Waited well over an hour and finally went in shop to find someone to get my keys. Big 0 down the street had me in and out in a half hour without appointment.. And kept me informed thru the whole process.. Firestone!! You need to step it up... Won't be back!!!< /Review>

Now I understand why this place has so many bad reviews. I had an appointment for 4pm and when I get there, on time, they said that the mechanic is working on something else and asked me if I could wait 2 HOURS?!
Seriously?
What’s the whole point on getting an appointment?
People have other things to do.<//text>

Roger the maneger should not be working there if he doesn’t know what he is doing! Worst place ever! Just horrible always trying to over price you for parts! They said they where  going to install something to my car but don’t install it or even mention that they didn’t install it. I found out after So many hrs later. If I don’t find out within time my whole cars engine would mess up. And they still don’t want to do anything about it. They tried charging me over $500 extra for me to take it back to there place and get it fixed! I done research and the parts they are trying to charge me for are doubled so they can make extra cash! The oil change itself took over 2 1/2 hrs by itself smh. never going there ever again. I wouldn't  recommend anyone to go there ever. There’s better places do your research.<//Text>

They wanted $94.99 a piece for TWO inner tie rods only and $208 for labor. I purchased both inner and outer tie rods for $40. They also said my bushings were bad. Big O tires had a sale. We stopped by for 4 new tires and asked about alignment and If they could install my tie rods. They told me only $108 to install all 4. After awhile they pull me back and show me my tie rods were good. No play, no damage. I asked about my bushings they inspected it and showed me it was all good. Funny firestone didn’t show me ANYTHING. Let’s say I got my alignment with a year warranty,4 brand new 17” tires 40,000 warranty, high mileage oil change, top tier ceramic brakes all for $755 our the door. Avoid firestone and go to Big O Tires!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< review>
Went in for an oil change. It took longer because they needed to get a filter from a different location so that was fine. I have an older vehicle and warned them that there are still old parts and some stuff might leak so be aware of that. Now, a few months later, I discover a huge oil leak. I take it to my regular mechanic and he said that the mechanics broke some housing, didn't say anything, wrapped it up with super glue and electrical tape and here I am now, out over $1,000 for the damage they caused and won't do anything about because all they "did" was change the oil and filter". Well they did more than that...<//review>

i paid them for a transmission flush and it wasn't done. Don't Believe the wall picture that says I believe fundamental honesty is the keystone of business. Remember it says "I" Not "we"  That Means maybe the founder was honest not them. when you walk in they smile offer you donuts, coffee, tv at the end they got you stay away.</Review>

<Text>Made an appointment at 4 PM for a simple tire rotation. It's now 5:05 PM and my car is still waiting in the parking lot. No one has even taken a looks at it. THIS IS FOR AN APPOINTMENT! Although there should be no excuses, these people her tell me only one person knows how to do the alignment in the shop. Everyone else has no sense of urgency and pretty much just hang out. The only reason I came is because they convinced my wife to get a lifetime supply of rire rotations and alignment for $100. I would stay clear of this place if you can find something similar to what they offered my wife.< /Text>< Pictures>

<rating>3< /rating><review>I am becoming increasingly disappointed in the customer service and the sloppiness of the work. I usually make an appointment as I generally wait for my vehicle and therefore to cut down on my wait time. I have had tools left under my hood, the technicians have failed to reset when the oil is changed, failed to put a new sticker on for the next suggested oil change, and today I waited 3 hours and 15 minutes to get three new tires. This is totally unacceptable. I don't know if they are overbooking, understaffed, or just getting plain slow. Whatever the issue, it needs to be addressed or I will take my business elsewhere. I have been a loyal customer for a very long time and have taken in several different vehicles, but, at this point I am very frustrated with this business.<//review>< pictures>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!! The mechanic named Victor was lazy constantly on his phone... He lied to us about what was wrong with our car took 3 hours to replace a spark plug and then called and said we had the wrong parts and tried to hold my car over night... I got my car back and seen he left trash under the hood and he didnt put a screw on the engin cover causing it to rattle uncontrolably im sure his way of getting people tp go back... On top of that normal procedures werent preformed on the vehicle.... Check emgine light was never on prior to visit as soon as we left it turned on... If anyone gets this mechanic ask for another one!! He isnt honest about your car... As for Mykela she was with him the entire time and lied straight to our face. Becareful with this place!! The manager as well has not answered coorperate calls and still has not responded to us...< /Text>

<Review>I'm baffled at the negative reviews of this place. My couple of experiences have been extremely positive. Once the mechanic took a look at my brakes and found the issue and fixed it without any charge. His reasoning for no charge was that no part needed replacement. I said I wanted to compensate him for his time but he refused. I will be coming back here again in the future.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80ea402d4b3223f3:0x7864e5d847409147</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Couldn't reset a brake lining sensor. Piece of metal stuck in between rotor and pad. Strut mount neede not strut.. I paid these guy over 1k and they just made everything worse. they wont refund your money unless you pay another mechanic to diagnose?. Long story...paid 600 to fix what they f"d up got all my money back from good ol" corporate. =) Stay away from this firestone,they'll leave your car running worse then when you  brought it in give you economy parts and charge you for premium parts..< /Review>

Went here for a simple Vehicle Inspection, after finding out what I already knew, they stopped halfway in the inspection because they Quote "did not want to go any further" and wanted to refer me to a Machine shop, but did not give me any further information.
Papers they gave me are useless and contained unusable information.

Whether through incompetence or malice, they tried a classic bait and switch. I used their website to find a set of 4 tires listed as being in stock at this location, and made an appointment. When I came in they said they didn't have the tires and I could either order them or buy firestone brand tires at almost double the cost. Needless to say I left and went somewhere else for my tires.<//text>< rating>

<text>They offered good service. They are quick, too. You can't beat the 4-for-3 tire price deal.

They noticed my alignment was off and fixed that the same day, too.

Marcos, the main clerk, is great. He answers questions clearly and seems to always be in a good mood.</text>< UserId.>

Service her isn't amazing.  However the price for tires is very very good!  Its a good trade off if you can deal with the wait.  This probably is a function of how busy they are so I dont blame them to much.  Good prices = busy!</text>

Average wait time for a 4 tire job .

Can’t give them 5 stars because they really need new chairs in the waiting area.

I like coming to the Torrance area because the people working there have always been nice, courteous, and helpful. I can see that Marco is a great team leader, very professional, knows good customer service, and really takes good care of the clients. Geo took good care of our car by changing oil, tire alignment, etc. He knows what he’s doing. Overall, I feel comfortable going to this place and feel confident that my cars are in good and safe hands.< /Review>

<Text>Tire prices were good and service was quick. Why two stars? They LIED about giving me nitrogen instead of air in my tires. He supposedly was giving me a deal. Instead of $20 they charge for nitrogen he’d give it to me for $10 because I got 4 tires and a full brake service. Come to find out they put nitrogen in the front passenger tire only. The other 3 are air. How do I know? Nitrogen doesn’t expand like air. My front pass tire starts at 34psi every day and no matter how much I drive it will only go up to 35psi. Whereas the other 3 start at 33-34 and go up as high as 38-40psi depending on how much I drive and or temp outside. This photo is after me driving from San Diego to LA outside temp is 77. I’ll never go back.<//Text></record>

<Review>Great customer service. Marco was helpful and answered all my questions. I searched for about a week and this was the best deal I found. Tires,  alignment,  and oil change. Marco found a tire that was to my needs and affordable. Did not try to get me to buy the most expensive.  He gracefully helped me find the right tire for me.<//Review>< Date>

Had a last minute flat situation, went to get a new tire and was immediately advised that in fact all my tires were due for replacement. I really appreciated the heads up but more importantly, i appreciated Davis’s costumer service. He never made me feel pressured to buy a new set of tires, he just recommend and took 30 minutes with me to go over my options. He was extremely patient, kind and respectful. he got me in and out, with a full set of great tires in just a few hours! can’t thank him enough for taking care of me the way he did. will definitely be back!</text>

<text>Although I have several American Tire Company’s closer to me, this one in Torrance is my preferred store and I don’t mind driving there. Marco is a gentleman who treats everyone with respect and professionalism. He is kind and very helpful. He looks for answers and I always leave there happy with the crevice. Give this shop a try.

It’s a really valuable price for me. Thank you! The manager is nice as well.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2b4d0bf98d0df:0x842d4939f1e92574</gmapID>< UserId.>

American Tire Depot exceeded my expectations!! Marco was very friendly and personable! The mechanics were just as kind. Not only did I get new tires I got new front brakes as well. They are honest and fair and I felt nothing but support from the staff. From now on I will be servicing my car at this location.<//Review>

This particular American Tire Depot store is incredible. From Marco the manager to Brian and Miguel the technicians, I was treated with respect and courtesy, from the first phone call to driving my truck out of the location with my new tires and wheels. I shopped around and ATD had the best prices for the entire package which included an alignment. American Tire Depot (Torrance) is now my go to for all things tire and alignment.

Thanks guys for the great deal and amazing work!<//text>

Great deal on tires good service but I had to wait an hour and a 1/2 exactly like they told me so they were punctual.  I think they were so busy because they have such good prices I noticed another tire shop in the neighborhood that was almost empty.< /text>

Marco was awesome! He was so accommodating on the phone and in person. His guys were on it and fast. He patiently waited on us and I’m so grateful to have had him service my car. I think what I like the most was that he wasn’t pushy on sales. He just let me know what options were available to me without any pressure. I was comfortable and will definitely return.< /review>

<text>Unbelievable service from David and Carlos.  Had a flat tire -- it was salvageable and they fixed it for free in about 20 minutes.  Carlos even buffed out a few scuffs on the side of my car.  Made a day that had started out pretty rough better.  The kind of place that makes you want to give them your business.  I will be going back there for anything I need.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I walked into American Tire on a Saturday afternoon with NO! appointment. To my surprise I was able to pick out a better grade of tires for a awesome price and got a wheel allingment. I was In & out the door in 2 hours. Hands down I got the best deal in town at American Tire Depot.  I would definitely refer a friend or family.< /Text>

<review>I like this place. The staff is always friendly, helpful and nice. Every time I have needed to fix my car, they do it really good.
They help you to fix a tire even though you didn’t buy it here.
Also, they have helped me to add air to my tires because sometimes it could be a problem doing it in a gas station.
Sometimes, it’s crowded, so you might need to wait.< /review>< rate>

<time>1581058984145</time><rating>5</rating><Text>About two weeks ago, on my way to work, I noticed my tire was almost flat and I found a huge nail in it. I drove to the closest tire shop (American Tire Depot) and they said they were willing to fix it, but they were out of the glue/sealant needed to repair it and asked me to return in the afternoon. I was reluctant to drive to/from work but thankfully I was able to do so thanks to one of the service guys (Fonseca) who aired up my tire before I left.

I made it back right before closing time and waited for about an hour for my tire to be repaired. When I went to pay, the manager on duty, Albert, told me there was no charge. I was shocked! They fixed my tire, right before closing time, and did not charge me! These guys deserve so much praise for helping someone in need out of the goodness of their hearts. I tipped the service guy (I forgot his name - Miguel, maybe?) and left thinking that we need more people like these guys in this world.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Well, I needed my brakes done. This time since my car warranty was up. I was not going to the dealership to spend over $400.00 for rear brakes. Albert at American Tire Depot was great. The price was great and the service was fast 45 minutes. They did a great job on my brakes. I'm going there for my factory maintenance real soon.< /review>

Their computers kept going down and when they were done the wheels and tires had stuff all over them so off to the car wash. Been going to Americas Tire for 25+ years but they didn't have the tire I wanted so I went to American Tire Depot. But Americas Tire is faster, friendlier and they clean your wheels and dress your tires when they are done. Sorry just trying to be honest. Also the yellow dot on the side of the tire is supposed to be lined up with the valve stem/sensor and not one of my tires is mounted correctly. On a positive note the price was pretty good.

Note: I contacted as per below follow up and they wanted me to email them with all the details. They said they were going to make things right and give me the manufacturer rebate. But it never happened. I sent a follow up email and they just blew me off with no response to either one of my emails.</review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great experience with American Tire Depot-Torrance. After contacting the Hermosa Beach location and being told they have none of the tires which appear in stock on their website ("we never get $50.99 tires. Maybe like once a year in locations like San Diego or Palmdale") I called and spoke with Marco @ the Torrance location. He made me feel welcome, found the tires I needed, matched a competitors price and earned my business the very next morning. He then sold me other needed services at a fair price.</Review>

I had a good experience from their Culver City store, and this store in Torrance had the same good vibe. Ron the manager was very knowledgeable about tires and helped me save money with his recommendation. His team also installed my new tires and balanced them quickly.  I would highly recommend American Tire Depot in Torrance for my friends and family’s vehicles.< /review>

<Text>I had purchased four new tires and had them installed all through American Tire Depot. I found the tires at another store for a little less money an American Tire Depot immediately price matched it for me and scheduled an appointment for me to have them installed the next day.

I shopped around and American Tire Depot had the lowest prices by far! I spoke with Chris on the phone and told him we’d see him soon. My wife and I arrived and Chris already had our sales invoice already printed up and ready to go! Chris was very personable, knowledgeable, and articulate which was refreshing for a change! When our van was ready i noticed they even put Amor all on the new tires! I would definitely recommend using American Tire Depot for your next set of tires. Ask for Chris!< /Text>

< review>
I purchased new tires the end of November. 2 1/2 months later I end up with a nail in one of the tires and of course I had a flat. So I bring it in around 12 o’clock to the store on Hawthorne Boulevard and initially they told me it was going to be an hour and a half wait.  Then they told me that because the flat tire is a free service that they had to take care of other customers first before they would get around to mine  because fixing a tire for free was not a priority. (So what? They take your money and then they put you at the bottom of the totem pole every time you need to come in to get something fixed based on something that they offer upfront and then they are reluctant about honoring that offer? That is so wrong! Don’t they realize that if they take care of you like a paying customer that I would want to refer  them to friends and family so that they could get more business? Just saying!)
So since I had other things to do, I left the flat tire at American tire Depot so that they could fix it and then I would go back and pick it up. By 430 I hadn’t received a call saying it was ready. I had to call them to which they told me the tire was ready. Their excuse for not calling was the person that took care of me left early which left left me to think why didn’t anyone else call me to let me know the tire was ready? I just felt the whole experience was simply poor customer service.  I am going to be very reluctant to do for the business with them.<//review>

I had work done on my SUV today and the service guy named Chris was amazing. He gave us such a good deal on my SUV my husband and I decided to have his vehicle repaired as well.  The auto mechanic Roberto was very professional he made us feel safe knowing that he was working on our other vehicle. Reasonable prices and great service!!!</Text>

<review>Finding excellent customer service is the difference in today's world and it sure seems hard to come by. From the first phone call looking for a quote to when I picked up my truck upon completion, American Tire Depot was fantastic! Ron was outstanding and took care of me to my complete satisfaction, and the crew did a great job replacing my struts and shocks (I had purchased tires at another ATD location in another city a couple years back). If you're on the fence about where to take your ride, I highly recommend you save yourself some aggravation and give Ron a call. I plan on remaining a repeat customer.</review>< Pictures>

Came in with no appointment and was told it would take about an hour and a half to get to my car. They got to it in 30 minutes. Found out the hole on my tire was unrepairable and decided to replace all my tires since they were pretty low on tread anyways. They put a temp replacement on my tire and ordered the tires I wanted. Great service!< /Review>

If you're looking around for a shop to service your car, stop right now and come here. I've been to all the shops in the area and they are all terrible except for this American Tire Depot. Abraham provided me with the best customer service I've ever received period! He was so helpful on my first visit I went back a second time to receive even better service. I've already referred all my friends and family and now I'm making all my coworkers come here too. Thank you for amazing service and a good job on my car, I now feel safe driving it.< /Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Made an appointment at 8 am. When I arrived at 802 they were not open. I was finally waved in at 815. The guy at the counter took down all my info, looked at my car and proceeds to tell me that my tires are not there yet (830 am). I had spoken with him the day before and I was assured that the tires would be ready to go. He called the delivery truck and informed me the tires would not be there until 10 or 1030. Waste of a morning on a day I took off to travel. Will not be returning here.

edit:
I received  call from the store and they were very apologetic and offered me a small discount on the same tires. While the discount was not much this place had the best price anyway. Service was prompt and my tires feel great. I was advised to call in because the online service doesn't always communicate with the individual store. I am upgrading from 1 to 3 stars.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Amazing customer service!  I arrived 45 minutes before closing and needed R18 tires - which apparently are not commonly stocked. Fortunately, they had two and found two at another store.  Not only did they drive to pick up the other tires, they actually stayed past closing to install them!  Honestly, I didn’t know this kind of customer care existed anymore.  I don’t typically write reviews but I simply can’t say enough good about these guys.   They have a customer for life!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1546106809226, 'text': 'Hi Elana, We are very happy to hear about your experience!

Question for the public.... Should one tip a mechanic or is the labor cost involved in the repair enough?<//text><rate>4< /rate><Name>Meggawoman<//Name><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

<Review>They overfilled my oil. I dont believe i got a tire rotation. Just cause i have a beater places should not treat your car as its a POS. service loss for them. I hope they talk to their workers and teach them that they should treat everyone's car as if it's  their own. What they do or neglect to do reflects not only on them but the company.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>I went to Allen Tire company across the street first, but they wouldn’t help me, even though I was a long time customer, and had a sever leak in my tire. They claimed they had 4 cars ahead of me, and they were closing in an hour and fourty minutes. I begged them to help me, and even though I am a clear handicap (missing a leg) person, and had a tire that was leaking air, they refused to help me. Apparently getting home early is more important to them than helping their customers. So I went across the street to American Tire Depot, and Chris (the employee) was more than happy to help me out. Thanks to American Tire Depot, my tire was fixed! I will go to them from now on!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>I came here completely stressed and worried because a large nail had become embedded into my tire. I was worried about how much it would cost because I am a student. Louie helped me out and they did a wonderful job with patching up the tire. I also noticed that things were a bit chaotic at the shop and it got really busy at times. Louie was patient, nice, and respectful to all his customers even though he was all by himself at the front. That definitely needs recognition. I will absolutely be returning the next time I have car trouble.< /text>< pics>

Trying to get home to San Diego. Ended up with a nail in a tire losing air quickly. Luckily we found American Tire Depot and they quickly took the car to fix the tire. The guys (Pep Boys ) up the street wanted to charge us $20 for a plug. American Tire Depot took the time to patch the tire. $10 bucks.  Thanks so much for taking care of some out of towners. Thank you Francisco and Jesus.< /Text>

<Review>DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.......The gentleman that helped me had no idea what size tires I needed because the software he uses didn't have my van. So he showed me two tires and claimed they were my only options. I told him I wanted 235/60r15 and he told me I needed wider rims (false) he had 235/75r15 already so it made no sense. He also had very selective English skills when I asked him to explain (typical conman tactic) ... I ended up going to sears and told them about my experience and they confirmed that he was a bullshitter and ordered the tires i need.<//Review>< Pictures>

I would not buy the insurance they offer again. ALL locations are closed on Sunday so you will not be covered. This location does not stand behind their product. They will tell you what you want to hear, but the story changes once they need to honor their word. I will NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN!

Since you asked, in your copied reply: I returned to the Torrance location 3 times, NO RESOLUTION even though the Manager said he would honor the warranty themselves since corporate would not help, 4 CALLS TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE, NO RESOLUTION, I never received a single call back from corporate, the DM or the area Director.

Given that, it's funny that the reply says American Tire wants to make it right. You were all given 7 opportunities to do so. I had to call back again and again before it was taken care of.

Ask yourself why NO ONE in your corporation cared enough to return a customer's call. That speaks for itself.</text>

I had a nail in my tire and went in to get it patched up, the business didn't appear to be busy, the cashier got all my information and asked me when the last time I had an alignment and gave me the amount it would cost for one, I had just been at Honda that morning and was not informed that I needed an alignment so I declined, he offered me a better deal for the alignment but I still declined. He told me it would be about a hour, so I noticed a ne Wingstop down the street and decided to go get some lunch, I go back and sit and wait until my hour is up, I go outside and check to see if my car is about ready, my car hadn't been touched yet, I go back and wait about 10 mins and it appears that my car still wasn't going to be worked on anytime soon so I got my keys and left. Even though I went here to get a free service, that was ridiculous and does not leave me to feel comfortable in ever doing business with this company<//text>

It's ok I got my price from the corporate office. They had a problem with that. Since I went there my low tire air light is on check my tires ok so I think the guy that did my tire stole my sincere out of my tire stim. So don't know. The lady I talked to at the corporate office or one of there office location was very nice, helpfully and try on getting me the best rate (price) to get my business. Since I had a good price on 4 tires from another place. But I was still seeing if there was a closer plus cheaper place out there. So I call there number in the hot sheet, she gave me a price told her ok thank you she asked me if I wanted to get them I told her no I had a better deal gave her the name of that place she said let me call you back I said ok as I was still calling around. She called back when I was on the phone with someone else so didn't get the call right there. After I was done called her back got transferred to her line and got me the tires I wanted 255*75r16 for $400 flate monted and balanced. But the manager and his one guy other one was ok had a attitude about the pricing on the four tires. So still have my lite on</Text>

Nightmare of an experience.  I initially scheduled an appointment at the hawthorne location but they couldn't do the alignment.  They said the Torrance store could accommodate.  I called them on my way there and I scheduled a 10am appointment and said to ask for Jose.  I got jermaine to greet me and then said it would be a wait when I arrived at 945.  It was 1230 and the car was still not worked on so I left. They said they'd call when it's done and so 4pm rolls around and I come back to find the car done.  jermaine gave me the keys and I drove off to find that my steering wheel is now 5+ degrees off. So I'm driving with a crooked steering wheel.  I come back minutes later for Jermaine to tell me that the results on the sheet show it's fixed.  I had to force him to do a ride along in the drive way and he agreed the steering wheel was crooked and off.  He stated that Erick who worked on the car is struggling and that he might not be able to fix it.  I've done plenty of alignments and someone either didn't have the steering whee straight when doing the front end alignment or the results are just completely off.  jermain then had me wait and said I can come back Monday to get it fixed since the mechanic that they trust and normally use is at another location.  At first I was calm and was wondering why they would put someone not experienced in place to fix cars.  I waited an hour and he said the chances of my car getting fixed is slim.  It's ridiculous at this point and he agreed that I was better off not getting my car aligned.  Another customer came in and began to curse and yell and I can tell Jermaine was having a rough day.  I didn't want to add further stress to the situation and still in a monotone fashion I asked for solutions.  He said I can get an alignment somewhere else and they MIGHT pay for it if it's under 90 bucks or come back Monday.  I live in San Diego and I have a lifetime warranty on alignment, so coming back on a Monday isn't an the best option since I'm in town visiting family.  I think when the tech adjusted the toe on the front end suspension, he incorrectly adjusted the tie rod making the steering wheel off center. An easy fix, jack up the car and loosen the bolts and adjust the tie rod.  The end result is he called Juanita at the sunset location since they had special hours on Sunday for a grand opening and asked that I can get service tomorrow (Sunday) and said for me to go there. I asked if I can get it in writing and he said he couldn't do that, so basically I have to go on word of mouth.  jermaine accuses me then of saying he's a lier when he stated the call to her on his personal cell phone wasn't good enough, I then stated I have no recourse for me to leave the store and go to another location for them to fix it - how am I to prove that there was something wrong and on top of that everything on the ATD website states the store is closed on a Sunday!  At that point I gave up, I came in at 10am, and it's 530pm and my car is not how it was when it came in.  It's crazy to think that everything was done by word of mouth and professionalism and common courtesy was no where to be found.  The automotive bureau is getting a call and the only proof I have is the recorded conversation between jermaine and myself.  Him stating the car was off, that the technician was struggling, and that I'm better off going somewhere else. I'm tryin to comprehend how this is now a problem that his tone and demeanor made it seem like I need to fix.  I'm sure they do their jobs but have some consistency and courtesy for all customers.   Imagine going to a mechanic to do a fix and they make it worse and tell you they'll have to fix it some other time and you'll need to drive carefully for the next few days. Talk about a liability issue.

I went to the Hollywood store as instructed on Saturday July 21st.  I come in at 7 for their special business hours for a grand opening.  As expected, I explain the situation and was told they couldn’t fix it and I’d need to go to another location.<//text>

Lame service! I went in to get new tires and they over inflated one, and a few hours later another tire was flat. Waste of time and money. I stated my day with tire problems, went to american tire depot and ended my day with tire problems. Thanks for nothing! I will not recommend anyone to go to your facility. Im disappointed with the service i recieved. I thought these guys would know what they were doing.  Now I have to spend more time solving the same problem.</Text>

The price I paid for 4 tires for our soccer mom van was okay.  I probably could have done better if I shopped around more.  The salesman was not super flexible on pricing.  I did however get a 70 dollar manufacturer rebate.</review>

I had a appointment at 11am,  got there on time and they said maximum 1:30hr, after 1:30hr my car was sitting in the lot I asked what's going on and they guy said we are going to do right now. They took the car inside and after 45 minutes nothing done on the car I asked how much longer and the guy said we going to work on it right and will take about 45 minutes to 1hr.  So I got my car and left.
Worst service ever!!!  4hrs to change tires huge differences than 1:30hr.< /review>

Went for wheel  alignment, they did a poor job.  In a month after the alignment, the rear wheel became uneven.  One side of the wheel got completely worn out.    Had to change new tires.  When I checked in an another store the alignment was off on that wheel.< /text>

< Review>
Ed was an amazing coach! He made me feel comfortable and confident while driving while also making sure I was safe. With him, I was able to overcome a lot of my fears about driving. One of my biggest fears was learning to drive out of my residential area. During my first lesson, I was able to not only leave my residential area but learn lane changes and many other useful driving techniques. Overall, it was a very comfortable and educational experience and I can't wait to request him for my next lesson.</Review>

On my first lesson I was too afraid to even drive in the parking lot and now a lot of our lessons were spent on the freeway! Ed is communicative and very helpful, he took efforts to make sure i was happy with my lessons. I’m hours away from my exam and I am very confident in my driving now due to Ed’s methods of instruction. I highly recommend requesting Ed to be your instructor, especially if you’re a beginner like I was.<//review>< pics>

<text>Ed was an awesome instructor and I would definitely recommend. He was truly clear, helpful, patient, and kind. He went through everything with great enthusiasm and patience. He even gave me things to work on and told me the things I was good at. With a great attitude and a comfortable environment, Ed made my first driving lesson definitely useful and memorable.< /text></record>

<Text>I had my first lesson with Hong today and I was pretty nervous at first, but after a couple minutes I was totally comfortable driving the car. He’s very communicative and helps you when you need it. He’s also very good at calming your nerves and making sure you have fun while learning. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend him to a new driver.</Text>< Pics>

They were able to pinpoint exactly what I needed to improve on and helped me fix my mistakes very close to my test. I’m grateful to them for helping me pass my test with ease!< /Review>< gmapID>

Was a little nervous about driving on the road for the first time, but my driving instructor Ed, was very nice and made me feel comfortable in my first on the road experience. He made sure everything was sanitized and took his teaching at a slow pace and always made sure that I knew what he was teaching. He was very patient and very kind throughout the whole lesson. Would highly recommend him.< /review>

<Review>Ed was a very detailed instructor. He was always calm and respectful. He guided me on turns ahead of time, I never felt rushed to do anything. He taught me so much and reinforced it, making sure I heard it many times so that I would memorize it. He also gave tips for the drivers test and things to look out for. He was very detailed, fun and gave a great lesson. Thanks Ed u the man.< /Review>< pics>

Ed covered everything important about California roads in our class! He gives good constructive feedback. He also taught me hand signals, which I didn’t know. 10/10 I highly recommend him for anyone who wants to either brush up and get some practice or for those who are just starting out. Ed knows how to guide the class based on your driving experience. Awesome class!< /Review>< Pics>

Let me just first say WOW! I’m so glad I choose varsity to learn how to drive, my driving instructor was Ed and he was amazing! I was nervous to drive on the road like anyone would be on their first time but he truly was an amazing teacher. He was really through and detailed with my lesson and he really goes over all the basics and tells you exactly what you need to pass your drivers test. I had a ton of questions but he answered them all and made sure to repeat and take time to teach me what I didn’t understand or was having trouble with.  He was extremely patient and I feel like I learned so much throughout my lesson with him. If you decide to go to Varsity please request Ed you’ll learn so much in such a short span of time!< /Review>

3rd lesson with Hong went so well! He was very well informed, was willing to answer all my questions, and even demonstrated a new skill- parallel parking- before I tried so I would not be nervous. His patience and clear communication of all the instructions made this my best lesson yet! Thank you Hong!<//text>

<review>Ed was such a great instructor. This was my first time driving, and he made sure I was comfortable with driving in residential areas before I went out on the main roads. He was super nice and understanding when I made mistakes. He always asked how I was feeling and if I was comfortable with doing anything outside of my comfort zone. I would definitely recommend Ed as an instructor!!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Today I had my first driving lesson and I couldn't be any more nervous. My instructor Ed though still managed to give me the confidence I needed to drive safely. I have never felt so confidence and safe at the same time. Ed's encouragement and involvement made me realize that driving isn't that stressful. Ed is a wonderful instructor and someone I will definitely be asking for in the future.< /Text>

During my first lesson with Hong, I really enjoyed the way that he taught. I felt like I was safe for the entire 2 hours, and I felt like I truly learned something out of the whole experienced. He always put an emphasis on safety and made sure to point out both the things I was doing wrong and right. I will be sure to book my second lesson with him again.</text>

Ed was an amazing instructor. When I first entered the car, I was extremely nervous about driving for only the second time. But Ed helped me the entire time, and did an excellent job of helping me not stress out about every little thing. I thought that driving on a normal road alongside traffic would be a terrifying, difficult experience, but Ed guided and encouraged me on every step of the way. Overall, I had an outstanding experience with Ed as my instructor, and I would recommend him to anyone who asked.<//Text>

My driving lesson with Hong was very great! I was  comfortable on the road driving with him. He was very open to answering any questions I had. I really liked how he told me what things I needed to work on as we were going. I appreciated his constructive criticism and feedback as that will help me improve as a driver. I felt so much more confident about driving after this two hour lesson. If you decide to go to Varsity request Hong because you will learn so much in 2 hours.<//review>

Ed was a very helpful and insightful instructor. My lesson with him went very smoothly and we spent a lot of time correcting my small errors along the way. The way he corrects my driving is very detailed and his positive affirmations showed me that I was improving throughout my lesson. Ed is a very patient instructor and not once did I feel rushed or pressured. I definitely recommend Varsity Driving Academy and choosing Ed as your instructor.< /Text>

I had a second lesson with Hong, and he was the best driving instructor I’ve had. He did the extra mile and helped my practice different parking positions and went over skills that were beyond the DMV test. He is very kind, calm, and understanding. I feel like I’ve learned a lot during this lesson like signaling, parking with step by step instructions, and how to drive defensively. Thank you so much!!< /text>

I liked that ed gave wipes before hand to feel safe in these times. He made me feel comfortable in residential roads and on the freeway. He gave me tips and tricks on roads and U turns. He is very patient and forgiving.I am much more confident in my driving skills now. 10/10 would recommend ed as driving instructor.</review>

He answered all the questions I had and was overall extremely friendly. He corrected my mistakes very calmly and helped me learn to become a better driver. I seriously recommend having him as your driving instructor!<//Text>

<Name>Tim Ruston< /Name><text>I had a driving lesson with Ed today. He was very nice to me when he greeted me and kindly offered me wipes to sanitize the car to maintain safety during these times. Before we started driving, he perfectly explained everything about the car and the rules of the road, and answered many questions I had. When we started driving, he was very calm and kept his composure, and was very nice when I made mistakes and taught me how to correct them kindly. During the drive he made me feel comfortable by asking about me and having conversations with me. I now feel much more comfortable driving and I’ll be excited to drive more often.<//text>< pictures>

I had Ed as my last driving instructor. He was very helpful with letting me know exactly what i was doing wrong snd what i was doing right! Ed also took time to really get to know me and make me feel comfortable. I was nervous about driving on the freeway and he made me feel safe about it! Overall, get a lesson with Ed if you can!!< /Text>

He was really good because he understood when to help me and when I was able to do something on my own, and always gave great feedback.

He also gave good criticism when I made mistakes, but was very nice about it. If it’s your first time with this company, ask for Ed.</Review>

This is a very good driving school.
I had multiple instructors and all of them were helpful. They were very friendly, experienced, and also answered all the questions I had.
I practiced on local roads, as well as freeways.
The school also set for me the DMV behind the wheel test date, so, I drove the Varsity car there, which made me more confident, comparing to my parent's car.
Thanks to the Varsity team, I passed my test first try!< /text>

Kam was the driving instructor for my first lesson, and he was absolutely great. He was very communicative and made sure I understood procedures from the handbook before I started driving. He was calm throughout the entire lesson and was encouraging. He was able to make driving for the first time as easy and safe as possible. He even stayed overtime to answer my questions. It was an outstanding experience, and I have no regrets.< /Text>

We reviewed all the controls in the car and we made the vehicle COVID safe with wiping everything down. As time passed Ed was helping me with common mistakes that I was making and was very helpful, he explained all the procedures to do on the road for me carry them out. Overall a great instructor, patient and friendly. I am now more comfortable to drive on the roads.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
I had a second lesson with Hong Tran today. He helped me not be afraid of the freeway and helped me see what I needed to keep correcting on my driving. He made me feel confident and helped me navigate during the freeway. I would recommend him to everybody who really needs someone to push them to not be afraid! He was very nice and professional and it was a very great lesson.< /Review>

<Text>My driving coach, Ed, made my first lesson feel calming and comfortable. We went over the basics of the car mechanics before we started on the road so I could get to know my surroundings well. Of course, I made mistakes, but instead of scolding me, Ed made sure I knew how to correct my errors so I was confident in redoing what I needed to do without fail! I knew that Ed only wanted to make me feel comfortable on the road, so I didn’t feel pressured to get everything correct, which calmed my nerves and made driving feel fun. 10/10 first driving lesson! :))< /Text>< pics>

<review>It was my first time ever driving on the road today and Ed made sure that I felt safe and comfortable. He provided disinfectant wipes along with a plastic divider in between the driver and passenger seats. Overall, I did not feel very nervous as he had good communication with me for my first time driving.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Varsity Driving Academy is an amazing driving school. Their costumer service is very helpful and tends to your every needs. I had my first lesson with Hong and he taught me many useful techniques such as SMOG and how to correctly pull into a curb. He makes the drive very interested and fun. He was really calm and gave me great tips on how to successfully maneuver my way on the streets. After my lesson with him, I feel a lot more secure and confident on the road. I would definitely recommend him as a driving instructor.</Text>

Khoa was my driving instructor for my regular lessons and helped me so so much! When I started driving I was very anxious and before the end of my first lesson I was driving on the freeway with ease. Such an awesome instructor.

Thank you so much Ed and Khoa!! I would recommend them both to anyone!!</Text>< resp>

I had a driving lesson with Ed today. Ed is the best of the best!!! He understands what it means to treat others with respect. Giving strong direction while keeping a collected presence. He helped me improve my driving skills on regular roads and on the freeway and I’ve never felt more confident in my own driving abilities. I’m really impressed with the way varsity and Ed follow the covid-19 protocols, supplying wipes and hand sanitizer. 10/10 would highly recommend👍🏼<//text>

I had Ed as my first driving lesson instructor today and he is very easy going and takes away the nerves of getting out on the road for the first time. He is a very good teacher and eases you into the basics and more advanced sides of driving throughout the lesson, he also makes sure to take COVID precautions like clear barriers in the car, and provides sanitizing wipes to wipe down the car with before you start driving. Overall he was a pleasure to learn how to drive with!</Review>

I just passed my drivers license test thanks to varsity driving. I overall had an amazing experience and the instructor Kam did amazing, he went over everything on my final lesson and made me confident for my test. I believe Kam really is the reason that I was able to pass with only missing three points. Overall an amazing service and 10/10 made my driving skills improve.< /review>

It was my third lesson with Hong, and he taught me very well. He gave specific tips and showed me how to do things like parallel park and driving on the freeway. I would recommend Hong to any new drivers because of his skills at teaching.<//text>

Ed was a great first instructor. I felt very comfortable with his efforts to help and teach me the basics of driving. I never had any issues with his teachings and was overall a great lesson. Thanks Ed.👍🏼</Review>

Ed was very calm and ready to help when I was having trouble. Wipes were given to sanitize the car so we were covid free. My parents wanted to take a lot of pictures and he was very understanding about it. When I was having trouble with my turns (left and U mostly), Ed gave me tips on how to improve and when to turn the wheel back to it's normal position. We did not go on main roads until he asked that I was ready. As a first lesson, this was a very good experience.< /Review>

I had my first driving lesson with Ed, and the lesson was absolutely amazing. I went into this with absolutely no real driving experience and did not expect to learn that much, but Ed is a great communicator and helped me build tremendous confidence on the road. I learned more that I could have imagined in only my first ever lesson. I feel very confident and excited to go out and drive. Thank you!</text>

I had my first driving lesson with Ed today. It was very comfortable and relaxed. He made sure both of us were safe by wiping everything down and made sure presentation was clean and nice. while driving he gave great instruction and i feel a lot more comfortable driving now, in my next lesson and with my parents.<//text>

<review>My driving instructor Anthony, was amazing he was very professional and knowledgeable! For my first time driving I went in uneasy, but after watching Anthony drive and receiving a few simple tips and guides I was comfortable. I learned a lot like the tips on SMOG (signal, mirrors, over the shoulder, and glide over!), and I would definitely recommend Anthony as a driving instructor to anyone as well as Varsity Driving Academy! For my first driving experience it was extremely memorable!

My third lesson with Hong Tran was incredible. He was patient and knowledgeable about the ins and outs of the driver’s test and had solid and easy to grasp techniques that made parking specifically a breeze. He also taught me how to reverse into a parking spot even though that’s not on the test, it’s just cool to know how to do it. Highly recommend Varsity Driving Academy, and ask for Hong Tran if you get the chance! :D< /Text>

I don't know what his first name is but his last name was Antuzzi and his first initial is T , he is  really good at explaining what needs to be done and it was a really comfortable environment for me, we shared a lot of similar interests so it was fun to talk about them and he was quick to point out any errors and corrected them and explained why he had to do what he did and how to prevent me from doing that in future.<//Review>

<Review>Ed was such an awesome instructor! I felt so comfortable he was so kind and patient. He took all fear out of driving,  I am so looking forward to the next lesson. He also followed all Covid protocol as well and provided wipes to wipe down the steering wheel, handles, etc. He kindly pointed out my errors and was very kind!</Review>< Pictures>

This was my second lesson with varsity driving academy, and this time I got the driver Ed. He was so helpful with correct my mistakes and making sure I practiced them until I got them right. He made sure that I felt comfortable the whole lesson, if you get the choice to pick your driver I would definitely chose Ed!👍🏻<//review>

Probably like most of his other kids i went into this having never drove a car in my life and i ended the lesson feeling comfortable and excited. Ed was clear and helpful on everything and this lesson was like learning to ride a bike.</text>< Pics>

He was very helpful in teaching me certain helpful tips that most definitely helped prepare me for the upcoming driving test. Ed makes it very easy to feel comfortable while driving and which relieved a lot of pressure for me while driving. He coached me very well and I highly recommend him and this school for any driving lessons.< /text>

Today, I had my driving lesson with Ed. At first I was extremely nervous as I had nearly no experience with driving. However, Ed was able to calmly transition me into driving in a very helpful and effective manner. Throughout the lesson I felt safe and comfortable being able to practice my driving on the main road. Thank you varsity driving and Ed!<//Review>

I had my first varsity driving academy instructor practice. My driving instructor was Ed! My experience was amazing! He taught me so much. I feel like I could drive safely and more confident. His coaching style is really supportive and caring but at the same time serious. He taught me new things that I would have not know if he didn’t tell me. I really appreciate him!</Review>

I had my second driving lesson with Ed today and everything about felt smooth. Ed makes it very easy to feel comfortable while driving and which relieved a lot of pressure for me while driving. He had a plan set up for today to make the driving practice very smooth.< /Text>

<Review>This was my first lesson with Ed in April. This was my first time driving in over an year. Ed was patient and made me feel comfortable and confident driving . He made sure I do not skip steps and stay focused on the road . He was constantly making sure I was driving in a safe and defensive manner. He helped me with my weaknesses with patience . 100% recommended! Thank you Varsity and Ed!

I took another class with Ricardo Servin in June. He succesfully built on Ed's lessons. He made me comfortable and offered important tips on how to park and also effectively drive on free way. His lessons on turns, lane changes and parking helped me learn a lot of strategies. 100% recommend classes with Ricardo Servin< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Ed is very polite, patient, and professional. I look forward to working with him and his team again.</Text>< user_id>

<review>My instructor, Hong Tran, was great! His instruction was very helpful, he gave good advice on things to avoid even if I wasn't in danger of doing them. He gave reasoning behind why we do things like have enough space between cars when stopped at a stop light (in case we get rear ended, you don't hit the car in front of you). He was very calm and gave directions for where to go very early, which is very helpful. He also very clearly explained and showed me how to do things, and wasn't mad if I didn't know the answer to one of his questions. Overall, very good experience!< /review>< pics>

<text>My first lesson with Hong today went very well. I used to be nervous on the road but he built up my confidence patiently by taking me through parking lot, residence, then finally onto the road. The constant communication and instructions, as well as the COVID-19 safety procedures, made me feel safe and confortable at all times. Great lesson and instructor!< /text>< Response>

I had my first class with Connor and just finished my second class with Kam. I was nervous at first, but both classes were very smooth and my instructors were both professional. I was able to relax under their construction and received good tips from both of them. I have definitely become a better driver already with just two classes. Would definitely recommend. Thanks guys.< /Text>

This is Sam, and I had my first driving lesson with varsity. My instructor was Ed. It was fun. I was nervous at first and my driving has gotten better. It was my first time on a main road and Ed was very calm and focused on my driving. He was able to give useful tip and advice for U turns and driving along side other drivers. Notifying if I miss information and helping me understand my next motion for good driving. It was fun and Informative. He did pick up his phone a few times but it was fine. Thank you varsity.< /Text>

I have the first lesson with Hong. He is a very good instructor. He is very calm, patient and give me a brief but clear instruction so that I can be confident to drive. Thanks very much for offer the good instructor and service. Will definitely recommend Mr Hong to others.

I have the second lesson with Mr Hong on the next day and get good improvement with further skills like U turn, backing, parking, etc. Mr Hong is very patient to teach and help me to keep up with the driving technique. Really appreciate this.

I’ve finished the last lesson with Mr Hong where he tried to recap all the techniques that he taught me in the previous lesson. As such, he helped me get more confident to drive. What a wonderful teacher!<//Review>

I had a second driving lesson with Hong. Hong really helped me out with my parallel parking and my freeway driving. Overall, he was very communicative with me about how to drive effectively and I was really pleased with his clarifications. Really recommend him and this company! In my last lesson with Hong, he still provided really important information on how the driving test at the DMV works. He ensured that I remain calm and collected even under stress and Hong was very calm after I mistakenly turned into a freeway entrance. Once again, I really recommend Hong and Varsity!<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I had my first lesson today with Ed, and he is great! Ed offered me wipes and sanitizer, plus there was a plastic divider between the driver and passenger seats to ensure extra safety precautions regarding COVID-19 (and masks are worn as well). I felt very safe in the car from safety to driving on the road. I feel extremely confident after my lesson with Ed, and he is a great instructor. He was very straight forward on how I can improve my driving to fixing any mistakes made (while also reassuring me I was doing a great job!); after the two hours were over, I feel very assured in my driving!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Today I had a driving lesson with Ed, and I’m very grateful. I was nervous at first since I wasn’t used to driving often, but he did a great job coaching me along the way. I feel so much more confident on the road and will be scheduling more lessons, thank you!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

First lesson with Hong.  The lesson was very good, and Hong was very good at teaching me what I did right, and correcting me in what I did wrong.  He taught me tricks and tips on how to keep safe while driving, which were very useful.  I would definitely recommend Hong to another student driver.< /text>

I love this driving academy!
I took classes with Anthony, and it was super fun, because he’s super friendly, professional and chill, so that made me feel comfortable while driving.

And also took classes with Sam, he was super cool, he made me feel super comfortable when I was super nervous driving, but he transfer me like a calm and positive vibe so I got less Nervous and stressed!

Both teachers where very professional and friendly they gave me feedback of how get better and what I did good!<//Text>

I had my first driving lesson with varsity and my driving instructor was Ed. He was very helpful and was able to answer all of my questions. After my lesson I feel very comfortable driving with my parents. I also drove on the freeway for the first time witch was fantastic. Ed also follows all the COVID safety protocols. Thank you varsity and Ed. 👍</review>

Ed was an excellent instructor. After two hours of behind the wheel instruction with him, my driving skills improved tremendously. He is a great, calm coach. I was very comfortable throughout the entire lesson and the car was thoroughly clean as they take extra precautions during this time. I definitely recommend him.</Text>

Gave me the best guidance and tips for driving, really cared about my abilities and wants to see me and all his other students succeed. He goes the extra mile with printing out paper that easily show me what I do good at and need to work on and he has such a great personality and energy. After my lesson he left me with materials and links to all things needed to know for the final test. Was a pleasure to ride with him and for the price it was an amazing learning experience and I now have so many takeaways for the drivers test, wonderful school and Kam definitely deserves some recognition, would do it over again if I could!</Review>< Pics>

<review>This is Jackie I had my first driving lesson with Ed. He was very calm, and explained things at a great pace. I was very anxious to start and he made it super easy with small steps. I did not think I would achieve and feel so confident after one lesson. He did an amazing job and was super clean and gave sanitation and wipes. He also wore a mask and had a middle shield between us which made it comfortable.<//review>< user_name>

I had my first lesson with Hong today. I was really afraid of driving since i had no experience at all, but Hong was very understanding and guided me throughout the whole way. He taught me the essentials of and the ways to be a defensive driver. Overall Hong was a great teacher and i would recommend him to anyone who’s first starting out like me.<//review>

I had my second lesson with Hong. He was awesome! He was very thoughtful and patient with me and was a great teacher. He taught me how to parallel park, pull up to curbs and how to make my lane changes better. I would definitely recommend him to my friends to have him as a teacher. Thank you Varsity Driving! This is as a 10/10 experience!< /review>

I was very impressed with Ed’s coaching style, for instance, he taught me many new thing that I never heard off, like how you’re suppose to be 1 car length away from the other car when stopping at a red light. He also helped me improve all the little flaws I had. Varsity is very lucky to have such and incredible instructor like Ed.

He reminded me of important things that will be checked on the test and had a list of things on paper to be careful of so that I can review. Overall, great experience!</review>

He also made sure to go through every single required procedure as to make sure I would be prepared for the test. Both lessons, he was patient, informative, and entertaining.

Before the lesson, I was extremely nervous, but now, after my lesson I feel more confident in driving and very happy. Highly recommend him as a driving instructor, especially a first driving instructor. :)< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

He did a great job making sure I knew what to do and described everything well. Kam also made sure to review important rules for my driving test. He was a very nice, calm, supportive and informative instructor. I absolutely recommend him!!<//text>< Pictures>

I had my first driving lesson today with Ed! Today’s lesson really made me feel much more comfortable driving on the road, and fully prepared me for my future driving lessons and/or experiences. I didn’t feel too overwhelmed but yet was able to absorb all of the necessary information given during the lesson. Overall, a great lesson and a great instructor! :)<//text>

I had my lesson with Coach Ed and he was an extremely professional instructor. He offered cleaning wipes, masks, hand sanitizer, and he even put up a plastic barrier between us to ensure my safety. He was very relaxed and constructive which made the experience enjoyable and quite comfortable. Whenever I made a slight error, he calmly reminded me what to do after and continued to encourage me throughout the lesson. My expectations have been exceeded so far and I highly recommend Coach Ed as he’s a perfect teacher and guide for all levels of drivers. This is a solid 5 star rating from me!< /Text>

<review>I just finished my 6 hours behind the wheel training with VDA and my instructor Anthony Becerra was super chill. He’s very attentive and he will have your back no matter what happens. He will try to always keep a smile on your face and he tries to keep a conversation. I definitely made the right choice choosing VDA.<//review>< Date>

I had a driving lesson today with Ed as my instructor. It was very covid-friendly, masks on at all times and a plastic barrier between the seats, and everything in the car being wiped down before and after. 100% a worthwhile use of two hours, and I’m much more confident in my driving ability now.</Review>

I had a second lesson with Hong and I really enjoyed it. He made sure that whatever he taught u completely understood and would repeat it until I did. Additionally, he gave me good pointers on driving and was good on reinforcing them. I definitely would recommend Hong as your driving instructor.< /Review>

I had my first lesson with Hong. He was very patient and was a good communicator. I was a little timid at first, but he eased me into getting more comfortable.

I had my second lesson with Hong. He helped me get more comfortable with staying up to speed with traffic, and changing lanes more fluidly. He gave me some great tips with parking, and was overall really helpful.<//Review>

Varsity is awesome. Their dedicated instructors and staff members are very professional and served us well.  Due to Covid 19 there were several schedule changes and they helped us navigate through the difficulty of scheduling and my son passed the road test in first trial. I would recommend Varsity to anyone in OC.<//text>

<user_name>wael fatnassi</user_name><Time>1617387115225< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Today, I had my behind the wheel test at the San Clemente DMV. I had signed up for the varsity DMV package. I got a call from the varsity instructor Ed yesterday confirming the pickup  time and what to expect. Ed showed up a few minutes early this morning and he was very courteous and professional. He let me drive the car to get warmed up and also gave me last minute very helpful tips. The DMV test went fine and I passed easily. I would like to thank varsity driving school and specially Ed for helping me through the process of learning driving. Coming from outside the US I had to learn the driving and get to understand the rules. Ed is awesome and makes things very easy and simple for me. I also want to thank the varsity office staff. They were very pleasant and getting driving lesson appointments was an easy process. I would rate my overall experience 10/10 👍

I’ve done multiple driving lessons with Ed and he such great instructor and coach. He makes me  very confident on my driving skills with his patience and calm attitude. Everytime he reminds me of the important things that I may forget while I’m driving and he does that very calmly. My driving skills have improved a lot and my confidence has increased thanks to Ed. He is truly the G.O.A.T. I totally recommend Varsity Driving School and Ed 👍< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I had my lesson with Ed today. He was so kind, and very educated about driving and driving safety. Going into the lesson I had a few questions and concerns about my driving, but by after my lesson I felt very comfortable in my driving. Ed was very helpful, and made me 100% prepared for my test.<//text>< Pictures>

Hong was an amazing instructor and he helped me learn to drive for the first time! It was a calm and overall incredible experience!

I would also like to mention Jon Sihilling for giving me the confidence to drive independently and teaching me some of the most difficult challenges I faced as a student driver. He gave me a new perspective and the ability to trust myself when driving, which was amazing and helpful. I hope that he gets the recognition he deserves!< /Text>

My instructor, Hong Tran, was very forgiving and didn’t get angry over mistakes, but he made sure that I knew the mistake and corrected it. He was also very good at explaining things in a simpler way. Update from my second lesson, it was very fun and stress-free. Even though we took it onto the freeway, I was not nervous because of his reassurance. He also gave me good advice and fixed my mistakes. Just finished my third lesson and I feel much more confident in my parking and freeway driving skills. I highly recommend driving with Hong Tran as it is stress free, but also a good learning experience.<//Review>

I had a driving lesson with Ed and it was my third and final lesson and I couldn’t be happier with my experience. Ed was very helpful and informative regarding driving on the freeway/highway which helped me ease my anxiety about driving on the freeway. He taught me excellent things that I will extend from our lesson together to other aspects of my life. Great job Varsity Driving Academy and thank you Ed!< /Review>

2nd lesson with Hong was amazing. Very interactive and demonstrative with practical details that’ll help you on the test and on the road. He’s very friendly and gives you step-by-step processes for skills like parallel parking and goes even further by taking you into the freeway (few instructors do this nowadays). Highly recommend.< /Text>

Because of VDA, I became a more confident and defensive driver after each lesson. After 3 lessons, I feel incredibly prepared for my upcoming license exam. Particularly, Ed was a very knowledgeable and excellent instructor allowing me feel safe and comfortable throughout my whole lesson, teaching me the basics as well as tips and tricks. Thanks VDA!<//Review>

Ed was my Varsity Driving Instructor; I started off pretty shaky and nervous from the start, but after gaining a little confidence and listening to my instructors directions, it made everything a lot easier. Also learned a lot of new techniques that’ll make my driving easier. Thank you Varsity Driving Academy and Ed. 👍🏻<//Review>

This is Maddie. I had my first driving lesson with Ed. First off, the safety features of this car were amazing. My driving instructor had wipes, a screen separator, hand sanitizer, and we both wore masks. The car I was in was very clean. Secondly, my driving instructor improved my driving skills drastically. He challenged me to learn new helpful things like U-Turns and getting on and off the freeway. He was very calm the whole two hours and made me a better driver by being very alert and explaining things in depth.</text>

I had a driving lesson with Ed today. He showed me so much in the little time I had with him and boosted my confidence for this upcoming driving test. I was really nervous at first and now I have a good chance of passing this test. He corrected all my mistakes and make me feel comfortable while driving with his communication and at ease. He went through all the the varsity checklist in detail and made sure I understood everything. We had extra practice on the things I needed a little work on and now I’m feeling ready. Thank you varsity and Ed👍<//text>

Ed made sure that I felt comfortable before entering his car by offering, hand sanitizer, hand wipes, and masks. I appreciate the extra effort in making sure I was as comfortable as can be before starting the lesson. I was a little hesitant at first with going on the main road but I think that was simply because I hadn’t been on the road in a while. Ed engaged in conversations so that it did not just feel like a business without any socializing so I appreciate that component as well.there were different techniques that Ed brought up to my attention about slowly gliding into the other lanes and making turns that made me feel confident after processing his advice. I would highly recommend Ed to any new drivers or teens that are having confidence issues with driving.</review></record>

This is Alex. I had my first driving lesson with varsity driving academy. Ed offered me a very safe environment and made everything very comfortable. His coaching was not to harsh and not too light. He always wants the best for his students. I feel comfortable behind the wheel to start practicing with my parents.<//Review>

The safety features were great, even with all of the COVID problems. There wasn’t any time when I felt uncomfortable. Definitely would recommend!!👍🏼< /review>

<Text>I had my third lesson with Varsity Driving today. It was my first lesson with Hong. He was the best instructor I had by far. He taught me so much just in one lesson!

< Review>
This is Adam and I had my first official driving lesson with Ed. Ed made sure that I felt comfortable before entering his car by offering, hand sanitizer, hand wipes, and masks. I appreciate the extra effort in making sure I was as comfortable as can be before starting the lesson. I was a little hesitant at first with going on the main road but I think that was simply because I hadn’t been on the road in a while. Ed engaged in conversations so that it did not just feel like a business without any socializing so I appreciate that component as well.there were different techniques that Ed brought up to my attention about slowly gliding into the other lanes and making turns that made me feel confident after processing his advice. I would highly recommend Ed to any new drivers or teens that are having confidence issues with driving.< /Review>

Went over the basics, as well as more challenging things you may not think about such as essential steps on how to back into a parking space. Great teaching methods and tips to help me pass my driving test. Request Hong when scheduling your lessons!

Update: Had my last lesson with Hong! He took me to the DMV to review everything before my test. Highly recommend requesting Hong for any driving lessons.</Review>< user>

He always wants the best for his students. I feel comfortable behind the wheel to start practicing with my parents.< /Review>

My name is Liv and I have used Ed for 2 lessons now and I am very impressed on the amount my driving has improved in my four hours spent with Ed. He is very patient and understanding which makes driving with him comfortable and less stressful. He is not harsh when giving instruction. In addition I felt super safe with the safety precautions taken. There was a plexiglass divider, sanitizing wipes, and he wore a mask. I would highly recommended requesting Ed for your next lesson!<//review>

I had a third lesson with Hong and he took extra steps to teach me how to be a good driver on the road. I learned how different ways to park, including reverse parking. I learned fast lane changes and reading signs on the toll road. He advised me on the test and what to look for and gave me tips. He’s also really kind and explains everything really well. I highly recommend him as an instructor.< /review>

I just took my first lesson with an instructor named Hong Tran. He was very good at assessing my skills and giving me valuable advice. I thought he did a good job structuring the lesson. He was very professional in the way he explained the different techniques that he taught me and did a good job at explaining to me how to judge the road and how to be a safe and protective driver. Over all the lesson was very thorough, and was a great first experience into driving academy. I would definitely recommend this driving school. (If you can, ask for Hong Tran as an instructor)</review>

I had a 3rd lesson with Hong, he taught me everything I wasn’t sure about and was happy to answer any questions I had.  Anything I requested more practice for he found a good place to do it and taught me step by step the most effective and safest methods.  Finally, the way he taught was kind and effective, without being rude or distracting me in any way.< /text>

<Review>First lesson with Hong
Mr. Hong helped me with controlling my fear, being very calm and collective when I was getting nervous and calmed me down
He is professional because he helped me drive the car down roads on my first lesson and brought my confidence up significantly while driving
He communicated with me while I was driving helping  me drive better<//Review><Response>None< /Response><userid>110342976817584145697< /userid>< Pictures>

<Text>I had my first driving lesson and my driving coach was Ed. Before this lesson, I felt very scared of driving on main roads rather than residential neighborhoods, but in the 2 hour lesson I became more confident at sharing the road with other vehicles as well as driving at speeds higher than I had previously been comfortable with. It was a great experience!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

This is Nathan and I had my driving lesson with Ed. He was very helpful throughout my driving and helped get ready for my DMV test too. He made sure that I was making all the thing in order to pass my test. He was very welcoming and my instructor kept me very safe with giving me wipes. All in all great lesson and highly recommend varsity driving and Ed the instructor.< /review>

I just had my first lesson with my instructor, Ed. I had an amazing time. The comfort even through these times was still there, he offered me wipes and gloves, and we both wore masks. He was very clear when speaking, and we even engaged in small talk which was very nice. Ed took me on the freeway for the first time and helped me every step of the way from exiting my house and exiting the freeway. Overall a very good experience and would DEFINITELY recommend< /Review>

<review>I just had my fourth lesson with Varsity Driving Academy and this time it was an instructor named Jack. By far, this was the best lesson: we went to the DMV and went through the routes, did the basics of the test, strengthened my lane changes, etc. Regarding this instructor Jack, he's the best one I've had so far. He was professional but friendly, and he even supplied and used hand sanitizer, wipes, and a mask, which was very nice considering the current pandemic. He was also very calm and collected so while you drove, even if you aren't the best driver, you'd still feel safe. The 2 hours were well spent and I learned a lot. He spoke kindly of this company showing that Varsity is truly ran properly and the employees are happy.< /review>< Date>

<Review>I had a drive lesson this morning with Ed, I liked the fact that he helped me prepared for the test and made sure that if there was anything wrong with my drive he would help correct it. I couldn’t recommend him more as your driving instructor, plus he is very kind and respectful to you as the driver.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

I had Kam as my instructor. I felt really comfortable during the whole thing. It was my last driving lesson before my test so I was really anxious. But Kam came really prepared and helped me feel like I was more prepared. Varsity Driving Academy, in general, has helped me a lot with my confidence in driving.< /review>

Update:
i just finished my third lesson with Hong. I definitely recommend. I learned to parallel park and 90 degree park in different ways, went on the freeway, and reviewed curve judgement. very structured method teaching so i definitely recommend :)< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I’m Austin and I had my first Varsity Driving Instruction with my instructor Ed. My instructor Ed was very helpful with teaching me some tips and tricks for when I take my license test at the DMV and made it a very comfortable ride. While in the midst of this crisis, Ed provided me with all the safety precautions including wipes to wipe off the main components of the car I would be touching and there is a plastic screen partially separating us to prevent the spread. Overall the experience was 10/10.< /Text>< time>

I took my lessons with Ed from Varsity and he was very helpful and very friendly. I even requested to have him for all three of my lessons. I was scared to drive in the beginning and he helped me through everything I was scared of doing. I was very comfortable with him and didn’t feel intimidated or nervous because I always knew I could ask questions and that he was there to help. I would definitely recommend taking lessons at Varsity and with Ed.<//text>

Varsity also has a lot of safety measures in place. There was a plastic barrier between me and my instructor. My instructor also offered me wipes, gloves, and hand sanitizer. All in all a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend varsity driving academy to my friends and family.<//Text></record>

Had my second lesson today with Tony... It was the best driving lesson experience I've had! Tony was very engaging and easy to talk to and taught me a lot about curb parking and helped me work on my right turns. I hope I have him again for my third lesson!<//Review>

My experience with Ed was very productive. He very quickly identified and corrected any mistakes I made. He communicated instructions to me very well. He also was very conscientious about safety regarding COVID. He offered wipes and gloves, and even gave me tips on how to keep my glasses from fogging up from masks. Overall a very positive experience.<//text>

I just had my first lesson Hong, and it was a great experience and I felt like I learned a lot during the lesson. Otherwise he was very friendly and had great communication. I would highly recommend that you choose Hong as your instructor.<//review>

My name is Nicole, and I had two driving lessons with an instructor named Ed. Both were very positive experiences and by the end of the two hours I felt that I had improved a lot. Ed makes sure to communicate exactly what it is you need to improve upon when driving, and he makes it clear that he is there to help you. He’s very nice and makes sure you feel comfortable driving. I’d highly recommend him as an instructor.< /text>

<Time>1604630216510<//Time><Rating>2</Rating><text>I had a second lesson with Hong and he made the lesson very awkward by telling me all the ways I could fail the test and he was 10 minutes late to the session and asked me to pull into a Target parking lot so he can use the bathroom. He also was very distracting by talking to me while we were at the Oakley headquarters. What concerned me the most as a new driver was that he was unable to find a proper route back to my house and asked me if I knew the way, when we were coming off the toll road. After I suggested a route that I knew to get back to my home because I knew one way from practicing with my parents, he then told me to get off on a different exit which myself and I sensed he was unfamiliar with since he pulled out his phone for google maps. After I gained my familiarity with the area I was in which he did not know I had, I was able to drive back safely. When we were in my home's parking spot, he asked me if I had my phone with me which I did and he almost seemed to demand I give him a rating then and there. I proceeded to give him a five star as he requested, along with a lot of nonsense comments complimenting him, which I have since taken down to explain what really happened, the only good thing about this lesson was teaching me how to park parallel.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2</Gmap_id></record>

My name is Abby and I had my first driving lesson with Ed, right away I felt comfortable driving in the car  it was very sanitary and safe we wore our masking and used wipes to clean the steering wheel. This lesson gave me more confidence in my driving and I learned very important things. I feel that it is really helping me prepare for my driving test, and that the instructor knew what he was talking about witch felt very professional!< /Text>

My name is Sofia and today I had my first driver’s lesson with my instructor, Ed. The lesson went very smoothly and my instructor was very encouraging and calmly helped me to learn how to drive on the road. He was also very informative and made sure that I knew what everything was called and how everything worked. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend varsity driving academy and my instructor, Ed, to my friends and family.<//Text>

Was able to get my permit and license first try with their instruction online and in person. Would recommend their service to anyone who wants to pass their drivers test. I cannot speak for all of the instructors by I had Kam as mine and he was able to teach me all of the skills necessary to pass.</text>

< Review>
Ed was a great driving instructor - before beginning, I was very nervous and unconfident, but after 2 hours with Ed’s coaching, tips, kindness and assistance, I was able to comfortably drive 60mph - something I never thought I’d be able to do! Ed made things very easy to understand and I feel like I am a much better driver now!< /Review>

This was my first driving lesson with Ed and they take covid protection seriously by cleaning it and having a barrier between the us allowing me to focus on driving. Ed's coaching allowed me to drive without constant interference with him only speaking when necessary allowing me to gain confidence in my ability and fix my mistakes. I'd recommend varsity driving to anyone looking for Driver's ED instruction.< /review>

<text>I had a driving lesson with Ed today. My mom and are super high risk for catching corona so we requested that the car was corona safe. I really appreciate the car being equipped with plexi glass, wipes, hand sanitizer and if you needed a mask, a mask. I have my driver’s license test coming up and I feel really ready and prepared thanks to Ed’s help. His communication was super clear, his tips made perfect sense and I overall felt super comfortable.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate>< date>

My instructor's name was Hong.  I signed up for a refresher lesson and the school assigned Hong to instruct me.  Hong was an excellent teacher.  We drove for two hours and by the end of those two hours Hong had totally prepared me for the test.  Hong is personable, an excellent instructor and a great personality,  I highly recommend him as your instructor.<//text>

I have really seen improvement with my last two sessions with Kam. He was on-time for both lessons and provided lots of tips, advice and information during the lessons. He is also very kind and professional in his teaching ethic as well. He is an excellent instructor and I appreciate his encouragement in my driving progress.<//text>

My son just finished his second driving lesson with Hong. He had a great lesson and the feedback was awesome! My son said it was his best lesson yet... they learned life driving skills and parking. Ways to think ahead and being an attentive purposeful driver not a reactive driver. I would highly recommend Hong and Varsity Driving School.< /Text>

My son had 6-hr diving lesson w/ Kam.  It was pleasant experience.  Kam is a responsible instructor.  The company staff is also nice.  They call you and remind you about appointment.  They are happy to answer questions that you may have.   My son passes his driving test today.<//text>

My main instructor was Jack. The entire process from excellent, appointments are always available and last for ~2h. They pick you up & both my instructor and myself wore masks, had a plastic divider and used hand sanitizer.

Instructor was very knowledgeable and flexible about routes while still ensuring that I was doing everything correctly. Practiced on almost every major road after the first lesson + practice.

Would highly recommend to anyone who needs driving lessons or is preparing for the DMV test.< /Text>

I had my third lesson with Mr. Kam Akhavein, and seriously, he is the best out of all three instructors I’ve had lessons with.

Mr. Akhavein gives concise and detailed instructions ( which helps make abstract ideas clear to me) and really useful tips that could be applied to the driving license test. He even printed out papers with self-wrote notes to give to me so I could review all the materials later on by myself. Wow. The fact that there weren’t any irrelevant rambles during the lesson is also an add-on to how good he is. By the way, he makes sure that you get the two full hours. And It was indeed two hours of productiveness and focused learning, I really appreciate it.

Apart from being the superb instructor he is, Mr. Akhavein is also an admirably responsible and kind person. I could feel that he wholeheartedly wants his students to succeed. For the price it was an amazing experience, I wish I had him for all three lessons.</Text>

Varsity Driving Academy has been awesome. My son had such a good experience. All of the instructors were so knowledgeable, on time, kind, and responsive to any of our questions. I am so thrilled to have found this company. My son would leave for his lesson so nervous and he would come home so confident and excited about driving.  My younger son will definitely be enrolling with them next year.< /Review>

Ed was very professional and kept the car very clean so that I wouldn’t get COVID. He helped me learn on what the dmv expected me to know. His coaching style was very professional and nice. I would recommend Ed for all the teenagers that are trying to get there driving lessons. The car was also very safe it had all the pro caution to be protected from the virus.< /text>< Pictures>

We have used Varsity Driving school for both of our sons' required behind the wheel hours. Our oldest took lessons 7 years ago with Walter and our youngest had Pete as his instructor just a few months ago. I believe Walter is no longer there. Both instructors were knowledgeable and patient. Both our children passed DMV test on the first try. Scheduling driving appointments was easy and the whole experience was positive.<//text>

Hi! My name is Avery and I had my third lesson today with my instructor, Kam Akhavein. He was professional, and very thorough with driving instructions. He gave me crucial pointers for my driving test and ensured safety tips throughout the drive. He made my driving experience comfortable and enjoyable!</Review>

<Review>my name is kai and i had my first driving lesson with ed. while during this driving lesson i felt safe and i felt that ed helped me a lot, with many things like confidence and his communication really helped me, i was impressed that when i called for a appointment prior we got in very soon, i was impressed that ed gained trust in me and helped me with driving. i feel it was very covid - 19 safe because there was sanitizing wipes to wipe down the car, gloves were offered, mask was worn, and even a safety net/glass in between us.< /Review>< name>

This is Tyler, and I had my first driving lesson with Ed. Ed helped me through clear communication and providing me with multiple helpful tips and guidance. Ed offered me wipes and hand sanitizer before I started driving and there was plexiglass dividing the car. These safety features made me feel relieved and safe while driving in the car.</Text>

This is Christian and today I had a driving lesson with Ed. I was very comfortable because we both had masks and their was a divider between us he also offered me sanitizer and gloves. There was also wipes to wipe down the car. All these features made me fell very safe in the varsity car. I have my dmv test coming up and Ed prepared me very well for the test by giving me good last minute tips. He took me to San Clemente to drive me around the dmv to get more comfortable of the area. After the 2hrs with Ed I feel very prepared and ready for my upcoming test. I highly recommend varsity driving academy to teens who want to learn how to drive.<//text>

My name is Shane and I had my first driving lesson with Ed. Before driving I was a bit anxious with driving on the freeway and just driving in general. After my first lesson, I now know so much more than I did prior to driving with Ed. I learned how to drive on the freeway and everything that comes with it (lane changes, distance, speed), and I also learned how to make U-turns, which I had never done before. Ed was great at guiding me where to go and was very understanding and helpful when I made a mistake. Overall, I had a great first lesson.<//review>

I had my driving lesson with Ed and I felt very safe during the COVID 19 outbreak. He gave me wipes to wipe down the car and had a plastic divider. His coach was very helpful as he guided me through everything needed for the DMV driving test. I feel very prepared for my DMV test next week.<//Review>

My name is Jackson, and today was my first lesson. My instructor was Ed. I had never been behind the wheel, so starting off I was a little nervous, but I experienced enough to make me feel comfortable and have confidence in my driving ability. Varsity put up a barrier between the front seats, there was hand wipes, there was hand sanitizer and even gloves for me to put on if I so chose. I felt that my safety was taken into consideration and that during the lesson, Varsity was following the COVID regulations.</review>

I had my first lesson with varsity and my instructor was Ed. Under the Covid-19 circumstances, as soon as I got into the car, we both had masks on, there was plexiglass and he offered me disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer. I felt very secure. Ed was professional and made sure to go through everything I had to learn. Entering the car, I felt super nervous yet by the end of the two hours, I feel very confident driving and I learned a lot of valuable things that I will keep in mind for the future.< /text>

<Review>My name is noah, and I had 2 out of my 3 lessons with instructor Ed. He is an amazing instructor who really cares if you are prepared and safe for your driving test. He makes sure before even leaving the parking lot that you know all the features of the car and that you are comfortable. While driving he Dosent startle you’re our shout while driving he keeps you calm and makes sure your know where you are going ahead of time. He clarity’s multiple times to make a left or a right turn. He will make sure you practice everything such as u turns or parking. And give you as many chances you would like to practice what you don’t feel comfortable with. You complements you if you are doing well such as very good and good job! Due to corona many people are scared for contact but Ed makes sure you feel safe he offers wipes, hand sanitizer and gloves so that you are comfortable. On top of all that there is a pastiche see through divider that separates you and your instructor. I feel very prepared for my driving test and am very thankful for my instructor Ed.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend this driving school to anyone who want their teens or young adults be a safe driver. My son passed the test in his first attempt and not only that, he learned how to be a cautious  and professional driver. Special thanks to kenia for accommodation.
I also want to thank Mr. Bulman, Mr. Cheak, Mr. Oney and Ms. Herrera. You are awesome! Thank you for working  hard  and help others during panademic!</Review>

<Review>We were very pleased with Varsity, especially because of instructor Bill Bulman. He is an excellent instructor, who takes the time to walk you through all details and made my son feel very comfortable. If you point out anything you were not too happy about, they will address it right away. My son passed the behind the wheel test at the first try. I would highly recommend Varsity Academy.</Review>< Response>

<review>I had a driving lesson today with Ed and the safety precautions taken to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as the plexiglass divider between us as well as the hand sanitizer and wipes provided really made me feel safe during my 2 hours.  He also really helped me touch up on a few spots I was unsure about when it came to my driving, making me feel more prepared for my test.  I feel very prepared for my upcoming DMV test.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1597872528677, 'text': 'Thank you Owen.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>My name is Charlotte and this was my first lesson with Varsity. My instructor was Ed and he was amazing!! Our interaction throughout the two hours put me at ease both with driving the car and in general. Ed was super friendly and made me feel very comfortable during my lesson. His coaching was effective and precise. I felt that I have improved drastically through these two hours. The safety measures due to COVID also helped put me at ease. Upon entering the car both Ed and I wore masks, I was offered wipes to sanitize all parts of the car, and was offered both hand sanitizer as well as gloves. Additionally, there was a piece of plexiglass which divided us but still allowed for proper communication. Although I made mistakes, as any beginning driver does, Ed not only helped correct these, he made me feel safe and was not judgmental which helped. All in all, I had a great time and am looking forward to my next one!<//review><Response>{'time': 1593962571959, 'text': 'We appreciate it Charlotte.  Thank you'}<//Response>< name>

They made sure we were safe during coronavirus and had a plexiglass shield and they wore mask and gave me wipes to wipe down the car and offered gloves and hand sanitizer at the beginning.

This is Nick and I used varsity for my driving lessons. I thought they were very professional and took every lesson seriously. They were able to teach me the laws of driving and also how to succeed my driving test, as I was able to pass first time. They were able to help me by giving all the tips about the DMV driving test, which were very helpful. I had my DMV test today in Costa Mesa, Ed took me to the DMV. Ed was very courteous and professional, Ed even let me drive for 20 minutes prior to the test and gave me important tips for the test.  Ed offered me wipes and hand sanitizer to keep me safe from the COVID-19 pandemic. I would highly recommend Ed and Varsity Driving to other teenagers who would like to receive driving lessons. A 5 star rating from me.< /Review>

My name is Mike and my instructor was Ed. Ed is the best you can get when it comes to learning everything about driving. I learned so much about driving from Ed and without him, I wouldn’t be where I am today. He is the best coach when it comes to driving. I feel 100% ready for my drivers test because of him. Even though it is during the Covid 19 pandemic, Varsity Driving took every caution possible. We both wore mask, gloves were available, hand sanitizer as well, wipes to clean the driver side, and the plexiglass separating me and Ed. I felt safe in every way. Highly recommend Varsity Driving to anyone out there.</review>

I’m very happy with my Varsity Driving experience, I shared two sessions with Kam, who’s a great guy all around and I can see that he puts a lot of heart and effort into his teachings, lessons and explanations. I’ve never had a teacher who takes the time to write everything out and create a visual for you to see and review, and then put that visual into action via driving. For that I’m very appreciative and thankful I got to share my time with Kam. There were some maneuvers and challenges I was nervous to do (like going on the freeway) but Kam explained it out, told me what to do and what to expect and it turned out as a breeze (not perfect but I’m working on it and will continue to use the maneuvers Kam taught me) and an awesome challenge/ learning experience. I would highly recommend sharing your Varsity Driving experience with Kam!

I would highly recommend Varsity. I moved to CA from Manhattan (NYC) and had to learn how to drive at a ripe age!  I did a careful research on line before I picked Varsity (Irvine) based on reviews, instructor profiles and the smooth communication with the scheduling office. I took about 30 lessons with Varsity over the course of 2.5 months and received my driver’s license at first try.  I followed up with a few lessons to improve on freeway driving.
The administration/scheduling office is very competent and incredibly efficient and responsive. They explained the process of getting the license, helped me set up a packed schedule, and were great in accommodating changes.  They are excellent and very organized in communicating schedule and sending lesson reminders.
I had the pleasure of meeting many of the Varsity instructors - all incredibly knowledgeable and professional, each with their style, insights and advice that were remarkably helpful. Each instructor explained things very well and in ways that clicked, and I will remember. A big shout-out and huge thank you to Isaac and Jose with whom I had the most lessons! A big thank you to Michelle, Arturo, Daisy, Kam George, and everyone else. George was a wonderful positive calm presence for the test. I very rarely (almost never) write reviews, but realized how helpful other people’s reviews of driving schools were for me, so here you go.< /review>

My son enjoyed every lesson and passed his behind the wheel test the first time. I can honestly say that this experience is worth every penny. I even paid for extended lessons so my son felt comfortable and confident behind the wheel. I am grateful for Katie and her amazing attitude.

<text>I loved driving around with my instructor, Katie. She always arrived at my house on time and she gave me a lot of pointers that helped me during my drive test. Their online courses are pretty great too. I was able to gain a lot of knowledge of rules on the road along with passing my permit test on the first try. Everything went smoothly and I would definitely recommend this school!< /text>< Pics>

Well I passed the driving test. So it looks like they taught me something.
I survived the lessons. They did too. Can't do better than that.
The instructors I had were good. Punctual and good teachers.
As I said we all lived to see me pass. So yes this is a good school to be sure.</text>

<review>Great place to learn to drive! It's convenient and flexible for your schedule and they take care of almost everything. I passed my driving test on my first attempt which was way easier than I thought it would be because my instructor taught me thoroughly and was calm even when I wasn't. My instructor was Eric, so if you're nervous about driving I recommend him!< /review>< Time>

<review>I will just copy my review on Yelp.

My coach Tony Tran is very nice and efficient in teaching. He showed me the route and necessary techniques, and also a mock test.

At first, I had a three-class appointment with Tony, and because his schedule was quite tight, I had to find another coach from another driving school. That coach just kept telling me that I am not good enough and asked me to practice a lot of meaningless task, like driving the previous student home, and go to pick up his next student.....(Can you believe that? it would take almost 1 hour from my 2 hours session). He made me nervous about my skill, and I was such a fool that I took 5 classes with him. He just would not stop and made me spend more money...

After finding my confidence in driving was nearly lost, I decided to find Tony again. He encouraged me a lot and helped me pick up my confidence again. I am going to take the test next week. Even though I do not know the result, I just want to say that driving should be something fun. Maybe I cannot pass the test once, but I know I will pass the test someday. A coach should always focus on the new driver's skill and feeling, not his wallet...< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Wow, what a wonderful school.  My son got his driver's  license on the first try. I am so impressed with Varsity that I recommend this school to every parent and teen.  Mark, the owner and one of the instructors, was incredible.  His caring, knowledge, patience, and know how was the key to my son's success.  On one occasion my son had an instructor named Andy, who also was fabulous.  My son had five 2hour lessons and it was worth it.  In addition, Varsity offers an instructional tutorial that I purchased and it was extremely helpful.  Love this school and the instructors.<//text>< response>

I’m so proud that my son passed his behind the wheel test today and obtained his license.  I have to give a big Thank you to Varsity Driving Academy for all their helpful instruction.  The online class helped my son pass the written test his first time and his driving instructor George was an excellent asset to him passing the driving test.  My son has special needs and George was super patient, informative and always on time for his lessons.  I’m giving George and Varsity Driving Academy 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!!!<//Review>

All credit goes to WALTER, who was very kind and supportive enough during the driving lessons. He makes you feel at ease and gives great tips on how to pass the driving test. He knows exactly what the examiner in the test looks for and trains us for it perfectly. I was amazed to know how easy it is to park in a tightly packed parking lot with the tips I learnt from Walter. I would highly recommend you guys out there to enroll at Varsity to learn good driving, and also ask for WALTER since he is the best guy to learn from.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Varsity Driving Academy helped me understand how to drive properly according to the traffic rules. This is something you'd definitely want to learn for your behind-the-wheel test. ;) Tip: Ask for Katie. I like her best because she's calm yet firm. :)< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Varsity Driving Academy will get you where you need to be to pass your driving test. The instruction is great, and the office staff are friendly and helpful too. I had Walter as my instructor, and he was knowledgeable, patient, and fun. He'll make sure you have the tools to be a safe driver even if you're a complete beginner. The lessons are very thorough and effective- they'll definitely build you the skills and confidence you need on the road. If you're looking for a place to get prepared for your driving test, I highly recommend VDA!</Text>< Gmap_id>

We had a great experience with Varsity driving school. They have knowledgeable instructors. They are super flexible and accommodating with our busy teen schedule. My daughter learned driving so well in such short time I am amazed. She drives with confidence and Passed her driving test with one error when she could have had up to 15 errors. Mark the owner even stepped in when we had to get a last driving lesson we had not planned ahead of time. Abby at the front office is superb. Professional, accommodating, knowledgeable. I recommend Varsity to any concerned parent who wants their teen to learn safe driving. Thank you varsity for great work. My son will be coming soon.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Absolutely wonderful company to have your kids learn how to drive from.  I have had two boys go through this program within the last two years and can no speak more highly of them.  The instructors are professional, kind and understand how to assist young drivers so they feel less hesitant when they drive with you after the first lesson.  The second lesson just inforces that and by the third your child will be confident and they pass driving test with the most difficult tester on first go.  Thank you Varsity Academy its been a pleasure!  The three little will ones will be coming soon.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Worst experience ever. The instructor made a racistic statement in a small talk while I’m driving and also yelled at me when I made a mistake even though he know I’m just a beginner, which put me in a panic. I knew that it may be the case only for the particular instructor who taught me at that time but still I would prefer not to recommend this school to my friends<//Review>< Resp>

I used Varsity Driving Academy for my behind the wheel training and with their help I was able to pass my driving test on the first try. I was somewhat nervous at first to get in a car with people that I didn't know, whether it was their job or not. Though the instructors I had were friendly and successful at giving me the skills I needed to learn how to drive safely. I had James for the first two lessons, him being my favorite, and he was great at being easy to talk to and get along with while also being an instructor and helping me get through the nerves of driving on the street for the first time. For my last lesson I had Veronica, and she was as well friendly and helped to boost my confidence for the driving test I was going to have the next day. Overall, I would definitely recommend this business for anyone trying to learn how to drive safely and effectively.</text>

< review>
Having driven only in India where we drive on the left side of the road, I was rather nervous about driving in the U.S. However, my instructor from Varsity quickly put me at ease and helped me navigate the unfamiliar roads. He has helped me rewire my brain and unlearn some habits I had, and that is sometimes harder than just teaching somebody who has never driven before. I feel I learn something new and useful in each class, and feel more confident about my driving test.

They are also always on time and will accomodate you in their busy schedule whenever they can, which I appreciate.</review>

I recommend Varsity Driving Academy. They not only teach you how to pass your test but also teach how to be a good defensive driver. With only 3 lessons, I know that I am 300% better at driving and being safe. They got me appointments in time for my license test and worked with me on the times and dates and even on my 1 month short notice. Instructors are great and teach you all you need to know.</Review>

<Text>I enrolled my 16 yr old in the summer session, as well as 3 additional driving sessions, with the Irvine Varsity Driving Academy. His instructor, Isaac Downey, was the best. He would update me after each session, and my son was instantly at ease, from his first driving session. Scheduling the sessions was an easy process, as well. I also received an email prior to each driving session, as a reminder. I am so happy I went with Varsity Driving Academy and the 6 total driving sessions made me, and my son, feel a lot better, about him getting his license and driving on his own. I would definitely recommend Varsity Driving Academy to anyone, esp. for the newly teen drivers. The whole experience of studying for his permit, to driving with a permit, to getting his license was a lot easier, for both me and my son, because of our experience with Varsity Driving Academy. This is my 1st teen driver and I will also be contacting Varsity Driving Academy in the future,  for my 2 younger kids, as well.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Today was my first behind the wheel driving lesson. I was probably the most nervous I had ever been in my life. My instructors name was Tony who I believe is fairly new since there are no other reviews of him. He was really good! He was really chill and cool and helped me relax when I was stressed out. He was really nice about everything and he makes you feel confident. He turns on the radio and talks to you a lot, which helps you not to be so tense. I definitely recommend him, but he only teaches on the weekend so get him then!</text>

<review>(Katelyn) I just passed my behind-the-wheel driving test this morning, thanks to Walter from Varsity Driving Academy! I highly recommend going to Varsity, and definitely ask for Walter- all the instructors were great, but he really gave me some expert tips and helpful advice that made me a safer and more confident driver. He has a lot of experience and knowledge to offer, and he always shows up on time. He's also extremely knowledgeable of all the cities Varsity Driving Academy covers. I feel he went above and beyond just helping me to pass my test- and even my mom has learned a few new things from him that has helped her improve her skills! Once again I HIGHLY recommend you go to Varsity Driving Academy and request Walter!< /review>< Date>

I took the Behind the Wheel lesson and it was a great experience. Although I started driving two month ago, I easily passed the test. The lessons that helped me were how to park, pullover, and make a U turn.</Text>

Learn from Walter! He is the best instructor ever. I passed the test on my first try. He taught me not only how to drive safely and correctly, he also taught how the DMV wants you to drive and ways to pass the test. You will not regret picking him as an instructor!<//Review>

so i need my hours for behind the wheel at Varsity Academy and at first i had Jon he was great but then he no longer worked at Varsity Driving Academy. So then i asked my friends who else was a good instructor to have, and they all said you have to go to Walter he is the best most relaxed guy there. So i went to Walter and my friends were right he was amazing and really relaxed to drive with! And when anybody asks me who they should have as in instructor at Varsity Academy i say Walter is honestly the best and a greatest teacher there!So if you are looking for an instructor at Varsity Academy go to Walter he will help you out so much and he is such a great guy and a excellent teacher to have!</text>

My son took the on-line class one summer and then he took the 6 hour behind the wheel classes about 3 months later.  We had the same instructor each time they came to take my son out to practice driving. They arrived on time and took him to many different areas to practice. He passed both of  his tests, permit and driving test,  the first time!  We were very happy with Varsity Driving Academy!  They had a great deal going on too if you signed up for both of the classes at the same time.  Well worth the money and they were always ready to reply back to us through email and or on the phone.
Thank you so much!

My driving instructor was Mr. Mark McKinney and he was great! He was so easy-going and helped make me feel confident about my learning and driving even if I made a mistake. I was most definitely nervous during my first lesson, but he helped calm me down. I passed my driving test the first time and I fully believe that is because I took lessons from the Varsity Driving Academy. My parents praise me on my great driving and that's all thanks to the academy and Mr. McKinney! I plan on signing up for defensive driving lessons and I have every intention of signing up with Varsity Driving Academy. You will be more than pleased, you'll be ecstatic! I know I was!!</review>

<Review>Truly beneficial and an excellent service provided by the instructor. Not only did my instructor provide a great way to understand my mistakes, but my instructor remained calm and friendly throughout my time scheduled. My instructor made sure my driving appointment was made as soon as possible as well as setting it up on a day that is convinient for me. My instructor also took me to the driving test and was there to help me through every step of the way until the actual test. When I took the driving test, I passed with 4 errors. Thank you to Varsity Driving Academy for all the help!</Review>< resp>

<user>105844387887169272667< /user><Text>Having chosen Varsity Driving Academy, i can't say enough for how great the lessons were.  Before you know it, they fly by faster than one would like them too, but I guess that's normal when you're having so much fun, haha.

Walter had been recommended to me, and it was a blast driving with him.  Pretty quickly into the lessons I was already driving through the busy areas of Orange County, but it wasn't worrisome at all, instead having the opposite effect of making me want to drive the freeway and busier areas of orange county as a norm. That being said, the phrase I will remember the most is "GAS IT!!!"

Almost every time those driving around us made us feel cautious, Walter's would say "Gas it!", which saved us quite a few times, on the freeway.  Being able to learn as fast and as well as I did was through Walter's approach to driving; having me accurately and quickly approach situations I would have originally felt worrisome about, but not now, haha.

My lessons with Walter ended up being the most fun I thought I could have learning to drive. I feel much more prepared for quick decisions on the road than I felt I would have garnered from driving lessons before.  Especially after taking some lessons doing stick shift, it seems as if my driving abilities have advanced to the next level, which makes me excited for when I get my own stick shift car.

I highly recommend varsity driving academy!

<text>I passed my driver license test on the first try! With the help of Walter, I was able to not only gain confidence in myself as a driver, but also drive safely on the road. Walter is a phenomenal teacher and makes me feel completely comfortable while driving. He is very relaxed and gives good tips on driving. He prepares you extremely well so you will be ready when the test day arrives. I highly recommend Walter because he's honestly such a great, friendly instructor. He cracks jokes and carries on a conversation with you so you definitely won't have to worry about getting tensed up or worry about any awkward silences.

Good luck to anyone who is planning on taking their driver license test (: And remember, to choose Varsity Driving Academy because they have good prices and good instructors !<//text>< Pics>

<review>Really good program. Easy program to manage; my son squeezed in a full on-line class, permit test at the DMV, and 2 hours of driving behind-the-wheel before he returns to boarding school next week. Will reconnect with Varsity Driving Academy when he is home over Thanksgiving and Winter break to take some more driving lessons. Excellent customer service, great instructors, and an organized program. Thanks for making everything so easy on the parent. The whole experience was really managed by my teen son once I paid the fee. Super convenient and I recommend them to anyone looking to get a teen on the road safely.<//review>< pictures>

<review>I signed up for 6 hour refresher lessons after reading reviews on Yelp, with a constraint of all 6 hours within less than a week of time. The booking process was simple, efficient and fast and Katie, my instructor, was on time, everyday in front of my door.

As an instructor, Katie was neither aggressive, nor controlling but instructive while letting you learn from experience. On the first four hours, taught me how to handle traffic in freeway/ residential and business roads and on the last day, had mock drive tests that were crucial to understanding what was important for the tests. She also gave me key pointers on what to keep up and what to rectify and it helped me perform on the day of the test. On top of all this, she personally followed up to check how I did on the day of the test.

As an organization, I think they are effective and most importantly don't sell/market their own services but cater to the need of the student. The service they provide is worth it's weight in gold.<//review>< Pics>

I only received one really quick lesson before my trip to the DMV. Walter took me through the basics and showed me the skills that are needed to pass. With only one lesson I was able to pass the test with flying colors. Thanks Walter!!</Review>

My daughter got her driver license today. I am happy! : )
She took 18 behind the wheel lessons from VDA because my wife and I wanted she can drive safe alone. As you know, there are so many aggressive drivers in Irvine now.
The instructors of VDA were kind and gave her good lessons. I think she has got a lot of useful informations about safe driving from them. Thank you all instructors with her!
My son also took behind the wheel lessons from VDA 3 years ago.
They used VDA's DMV package as well. It is easy and very convenient. If you are busy or your car is not appropriate for the DMV Test, I highly recommend it.
I think VDA is one of the best driving school in Orange County.

Thank you! VDA< /review>

<GmapID>0x80dcddb056dafeab:0x86dae8fdfafcc2f2</GmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>Just had my first behind the wheel training lesson today with an instructor named Tony.
Although he may be one of the youngest driving teachers there, he's a very encouraging, calm, and patient teacher. He also made sure I didn't run into any curbs! At the beginning, we started out slow - in my neighborhood - then slowly through other residential areas and eased into driving through streets and intersections. It's not as hard as I thought it would be and Tony was really patient with my mistakes and never put me down. He also guided me through a mock test of what the DMV will test on. He made sure I was comfortable and tried to help my nervousness calm by playing music on low volume and sometimes started conversations so I'd be more relaxed and less stiff. By the end of the lesson I was calmer and more comfortable about driving. Thanks Tony!!<//Text></record>

I first started driving and with my luck I got Walter, to me he's a wonderful instructor. He thought me all the tricks to driving safely! My parents didn't think I was ready but Walter did, so I took his word and scheduled my appointment for my license test! I was so nervous yesterday (the day before the test), but Walter believed in me and told me I was going to pass. I took the behind the wheel test this morning and only missed 2 points! I believe that if close to a year ago (when I had my first behind the wheel), l didn't get Walter, I wouldn't have passed! Thank you Varsity Driving Academy and especially Walter!< /text>

The staff at VDA were very helpful in increasing my confidence in driving, special thanks to Walter. Before I began the lessons, I was always anxious about driving and just the thought of being behind the wheel made me fearful. Thankfully, Walter was a great help in reinforcing safe driving habits and I learned to grow confident in driving in about a month's time. I passed the driving test thanks to all the positive support and skillful instruction that Walter gave, thanks a lot!</Text>

I searched “top driving schools” and after skimming through the reviews and visiting several websites, I chose Varsity Driving Academy. They offer some competitive driving sessions. I chose the 10 hour (5, 2-hour sessions). The ten hours gave me enough practice to get ready for the dmv driving test.

Signing up online was quick and easy. They were also able to help me set up my schedule. Weekdays were only available since they reserve weekends for teen drivers.

My instructor was Chris Felix. He was professional, patient, friendly, and helpful. He guided me throughout the training on how to drive as a “defensive, safe driver.” I learned to put into practice everything I learned from the dmv handbook. I even learned how to properly handle and turn the steering wheel, how to properly use the brakes, and how to properly accelerate and decelerate.

Thanks!

I've had such a great learning experience with Varsity Driving Academy. My first lesson was the first time I ever got behind the wheel and I was pretty terrified. But within two hours I could already handle the wheel comfortably with the help of my instructor. They give you not only general tips but also specific, personalized pointers on what you need to practice. They really do over-prepare you for the license test and even make the time to teach you U-turns, take you on the freeway, and other things that aren't on the test but are essential to real-life driving. After learning from VDA, I now have not only my license, but also great driving skills that make me feel safe and confident on the road. I would recommend the 6-hour training to anyone looking to learn driving quickly and easily. VDA instruction is of the highest quality!</review>

I gave one star because theres is no 0 stars allowed. Save your money and go somewhere else!!! First of all, the office never picks up I doubt a business is that busy to the point where I've called 3 times and no answer. Second of all, I had the worst experience with a driver instructor who was the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life. He began screaming at my mothers face and yelling acting like a crazy person. Are these the type of people this 'business' hires? I can not say this enough, there are better school please save your money. Am only continuing with this because I have already payed but I can not express how unprofessional and bad this 'business' is.</Text>

After learning from VDA, I now have not only my license, but also great driving skills that make me feel safe and confident on the road. I would recommend the 6-hour training to anyone looking to learn driving quickly and easily. VDA instruction is of the highest quality!< /review><date>1389677383657<//date></record>

I scheduled all appointments at once, and it was easy to do so over the phone. Not too expensive, and they were on time every day. I took 3 2-hr courses, and had a different instructor every time, which turned out to be helpful because each one gave their individual input. All instructors were professional, kind, and very helpful. I could sense that they trusted my driving abilities and were always ready to help and correct me. They gave me constructive criticisms and praise when appropriate. The cars they brought were all decent: similar in style, ability to pump up seats & adjust mirrors etc. to my liking, and easy to use. On the first day, I practiced everything besides freeway driving. During the next two sessions, they took me [of course I drove] by the Laguna Hills DMV, and I got to drive through the drive test course a few times each day, which helped a lot!! They even kept score as I went, and gave me feedback during and after each drive through. My drive test was essentially identical to what I practiced with the instructors, and I passed effortlessly! I appreciated that each instructor also gave me a few minutes long break after the first hour. They ensured that I reached home exactly when my lesson was over. I felt safe driving with them, and didn't encounter any issues with the personnel or vehicles.
Walter was one of my favorite instructors, he gave me confidence in my abilities and made me far less hesitant to drive at the speed limit. On the last day I drove with the founder/owner of Varsity, and he was also very kind and informative. My mom immediately noticed a big improvement in my driving skills and confidence on the road. :)</Review>

THANK YOU Mark McKinney & Varsity Driving Academy!  Great experience and I recommend you to everyone.  Mark's demeanor with the young drivers is calm, calm, calm which makes the whole experience positive.  Plus, your added service of scheduling the DMV test appt., taking my daughter to the test and allowing her to drive the car she learned on adds that much more value!<//Review>

<review>If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I paid for my son's lessons and the instructor, Kyle Parsons, on the day of the first lesson text me saying he was sick and rescheduled. Then on the day of the 2nd lesson, he text me again to reschedule for 2 months later. When the day of the 2nd lesson came (after already rescheduling 2 months later) Kyle never showed.  No call, no text, nothing. I text him and called the academy. I got a text back from Kyle saying he had a family issue and no longer works for the company. I sent him a message back saying wow thanks for the heads up. His response was "There was a death in my family, don't ever text me again." Talking to the academy, they had a different story. They said Kyle just had a baby and didn't know when he would be back to finish the lessons.  Whatever the real issue was, Varsity Driving Academy should have contacted all of Kyle's students and made arrangements with other drivers. Horrible business practice and I would not recommend anyone using them for their lessons. Instead of getting me a new instructor they said I should just find another driving school. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR MONEY AND WASTE YOUR TIME!!!< /review>< pictures>

<text>My experience with this driving school was absolutely positive: Karen McKinney and Lili Balint did everything to assist me and find the best time for my lessons. They also helped me to adjust the time of my driving lessons when it was necessary. They also sorted everything out with my DMV appointment for the driving test seamlessly and quickly.

Special credit goes to Richard whose friendly and professional attitude helped me to build up my driving skills in a relatively short period of time, including motorway driving, effective observation and safe driving techniques. He also stimulated my self confidence so I am not afraid of driving in unknown areas and keep calm in difficult day to day road situations. Richard also has a good reputation of polite and easy going guy.

Wishing all the best to you guys, will definitely recommend you in the future. Olesya.<//text>< pictures>

I work a lot of hours and had to find a school that could teach my daughter how to drive and take her out enough to really learn how to negotiate Orange County roads.  So I signed her up for the Varsity Driving Academy their 20+ hour behind-the-wheel package.  They took her driving booth in the daytime and at night, which gave her the confidence and experience to pass the DMV driving test the first time.

Additionally, the office staff is very helpful.  We especially liked Ms. Katie Korona, who helped us pick the right package to meet our needs.  She also coordinated a driving schedule that worked extremely well with my daughters’ availability.  Her customer services skills are exceptional.

Our favorite instructor “George” has nerves of steel, and nothing fazes him.  I personally could not handle the experience of having my daughter behind the wheel.  She was not very good at first.  After a few classes with him, she improved immensely.  George is very good at pointing out why one needs to follow certain driving rules on the freeway versus streets.  This is really important because explaining the reasoning behind certain rules of the road (DMV) helps a student remember it when it comes time to drive and to take the DMV driving test.  His straightforward manner really helped my daughter improve her driving skills.   With all the accidents I witness every day driving home in traffic, I am so grateful to George and the other instructors for giving my daughter the driving skills to hopefully avoid being in an accident.  They took her onto the 22 freeway, the 55 freeway (which is known for its daily quota of accidents) and the 405 freeway several times so she would have the skills necessary to drive on them.  My daughter got her license but wanted a few extra lessons on dealing with nighttime traffic on the freeway, so I signed her up for 6 more hours.  This has been an excellent investment.  The night time driving teachers are also great and since most of them are at the high traffic hours, my daughter got the skills and confidence to help her feel better about driving in traffic.

As for the cars, they are each a  bit different in size, which is great.  My daughter learned about the differences between the vehicles and how they can affect how she changes lanes (in heavy traffic) and the different blind spots.  Varsity Driving Academy really took the time out to plan an excellent driving sessions for my daughter to help her learn the skills she needed to drive in Orange County.  I would recommend this program to any parent who is nervous about their child driving in Orange County or who want the best possible instructors for their child.</review>

If you're looking for a driver's ed class, then look no further. After just finishing the four day in-class program, I do not have a single doubt about their high quality way of teaching you to be a safe driver. VDA excels in helping you master the basics of operating a motor vehicle, and they do this by the sample assessments that you take in abundance, the videos they show you in class, and the very informative teacher that helps you throughout.

The first taste I got of VDA was when I called to set myself up to join the in-class program. I spoke on the phone with Caitlin, who made my sign-up was really easy. She was very friendly on the phone, and I was surprised by how smooth the sign-up process went.
This helped jump start my excitement to be at VDA.

Katie was my teacher and will be my driving instructor when I pass the written test. Katie answered all the questions I had, at the highest degree of knowledge. She was very friendly and very approachable, and you are able to ask her any kind of question, no matter how stupid you may think the question is. Katie is, without a doubt, the greatest teacher you will find.

And for Mark, the owner, was no stranger to the friendliness that engulfs you as you start to be involved with VDA. His demeanor was very impressive. You'd expect that the owner would tend to other more important duties, but Mark was there because he wanted to be, and that was very easy to sense. He would contribute a lot to the discussions we had in class and he was a very easy person to speak to. Mark had a great presence, and it was also great to hear what he had to say. He always had something useful to say, and just his general attitude was great.

As a whole, VDA's environment was very friendly. Oftentimes, the driving instructors would pass through and they all added to the friendly environment. You could easily tell that the people were there because they wanted to be there. They are strategically located next to a shopping center, so you could eat out during lunch time. That's if they don't fill you up with the box of chocolates that they pass around. VDA is an elite driver's education establishment, and there is no place like it.

To conclude, I do not usually make an effort to write a review for a place. However, I made an exception today. The reason I made that exception, is that VDA is exceptional.

No, but seriously. VDA.< /Review>

Hi guys! I just had my 2nd lesson today with John, but I haven't had a lesson since last September and didn't get to practice at all, so I was pretty embarrassed to have the lesson again so late. However, everything went smoother than I expected! John helped me warm up by letting me practice left turns, right turns, and u-turns around the neighborhood until he told me to go out on the streets. I drove around Irvine and Tustin, and even passed by my parents' workplace! Not only that, but John also thought I was able to handle the freeway, which I went on today for the first time! Lots of traffic, but a real and great experience even though there was an accident on the freeway since an enormous truck flipped itself by driving around a curve too fast LOL But yeah, John is a great instructor and really experienced. He understood me well and why I mess up (because I get nervous or I panic), but it helped that he was calm, and helped me stay calm by talking to me throughout the whole lesson. He told me that I did much better than my previous lesson even though it was so long ago. Whoot! Can't wait until the next lesson, thanks John!</review>
