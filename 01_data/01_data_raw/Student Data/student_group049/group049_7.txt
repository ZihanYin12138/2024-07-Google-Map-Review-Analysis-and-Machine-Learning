< Review>
I ordered flowers for my Mom for Mother's Day. She absolutely loved them. I searched everywhere for the perfect place to send my Mom flowers. Seemed like this was exactly the store to order from. My Mom is usually pretty picky about flowers and she kept gloating about how much she loved them. I will for sure order from here again.</Review>

Love this florist! I always get such gorgeous arrangements but they absolutely outdid themselves for my husband's milestone birthday last week! Linda designed the most magnificent centerpiece I've ever seen. Cannot thank you enough for your artistry?</review>

I have never had such great customer service, they really took care of my order personally and even sent a picture prior to delivery and it was just stunning. The service was fast and the flowers are still alive over a week later!< /Review>

Albert is a blessing! With my daughter's senior year not ending as she had expected we decided to throw her a backyard prom. Called several places for corsage and boutonniere sets, all wanted to charge $50 or more. Albert so understanding of the situation offered to provide us two sets for free. plus provided us with extra flowers to help decorate. His generosity is nothing short of amazing. Thank you Albert and staff from the bottom of our hearts.<//review>

<review>It is impossible to find quality flowers that fit your budget, even for some florists in the area, but I am so glad I came across Simi Flowers and Gifts. After visiting their website, It was so easy to find the perfect arrangement, ALSO, they have FREE DELIVERY TO SIMI VALLEY! I was elated and even more so when I saw the arrangement. They really go above and beyond for every bouquet, my flowers are still alive even over a week later, so happy I found them 🙏🏼< /review>< date>

I couldn’t believe how other flower shops were charging outrageous delivery fees for a destination that was a walkable distance. Simi Flowers and Gifts has free delivery which has me sold, in addition to their great prices. The flowers were just amazing, I would recommend them to everyone.<//text>

All the other Simi Valley florists charged unreasonable prices for just one bouquet and it never comes like what the picture is, but Simi Flowers and Gifts is nothing like that. I bought a bouquet for my Step-Mother's birthday from their website and it came out better than the picture and free delivery! You really can not beat this deal and the quality of the arrangement was just awesome.< /Text>

This flower shop is beyond excellent. They take their business to whole new level by the quality of flowers they provide and the type of service they give. Every interaction I have with Albert and his team has been A+ standards. I like how they offer all types of flowers bouquets, arrangements and gifts. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.<//Review>

I placed an order online very skeptically as I rather go in the store and place it in person, but due to COVID I had no choice. I was so pleased with how the flowers came out! My receiver loved them and they were really beautiful. Albert was very helpful over the phone and answered all my questions and concerns. My new “go-to” florist :)< /review>

<name>BJ Bigley</name><Text>Started rough but only because I originally ordered through Avas Flowers.  Avas flowers is NOT what they advertise. It is a large referral service to local stores. I placed an order that went through this store. The info given to Conroys was not organized or correct. They delivered the absolute wrong thing. I got upset and posted here. The owners from conroys contacted me directly to make it right!  Whatever you do dont order from AVAS FLOWERS ONLINE!  Call these people at Conroys directly they are real people and will take great care of you!

Kristina helped me find exactly what I needed and even helped me with ideas on what kinds of flowers would go nicely together! I’ll definitely go back there for future events.<//text>

<Text>FANTASTIC SHOP AND STAFF.  I live in San Diego and was traveling to Simi Valley for a memorial.  Stopped by this location as I am familiar with the Conroys in San Diego.  Tammy welcomed me and absolutely went out of her way to immediately help me.  I told her the flowers I wanted in the bouquet and left it up to her to create!  Wish I had taken a picture of what she created as it was stunning!  I would absolutely recommend this flower shop 5 stars is not enough!  Oh and her prices are excellent, I should have paid double for the bouquet she made for me.  Thank you Tammy and staff!</Text>< Pics>

<text>I had the best experience with Conroy's on Thanksgiving Day. They were busy with their orders but I came in for a same-day request and they treated me like I was their only customer. Kristina Aguilar was personable, hilarious, and hooked it up with three beautiful custom-wrapped bouquets. I, along with the recipients, couldn't have been happier. Will definitely come again!<//text>< name>

This store has amazing customer service, beautiful arrangements and always high quality flowers. The reason why my review is so low, however, is that the prices are outrageous and inconsistent. I used to find myself in the store to purchase a flower for my girlfriend. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful but recently I went into the store expecting to purchase a rose that I usually pay $4-$5 for and was charged $10. That day was particularly busy and I waited in line for almost thirty minutes. I gladly waited for my flower but to my dismay the cashier told me my single rose would cost me $10. I love the store, I love the people and the quality but I refuse to pay $10 for a rose.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>If I could give zero star, I would.
very disappointed !!!!

make order 2 days in advance for birthday delivery. Call the store on the delivery day morning to make sure, the lady said delivery will be made between 1 pm and 3 pm. that's fine with me. cuz recipient's work hour don't finish till 4:00.
but the flowers never made it .
my friend left work after 4:00 and never receive the flowers.

so disappointed !!!!

The recipient work address is just a mile away from florist location. that's the reason I chose this florist but turn out it was a very bad choice.

then after I found out my friend never receive the flowers, I call the store 4 times, no one answered the phone.<//text>< pics>

I worked with Tamara to get wedding flowers. Everything from the bridal bouquets to the boutonnières were spot on and perfect!
The extra care that went into the arrangements and the phone call when I forgot to pick up an item demonstrate a personal touch that can only be found in this shop! Definitely highly recommend Tamara and her staff for any and all floral needs. Do come in with your ideas and they will make it happen! I was impressed how they sourced even an out of season floral for this special day.
Bottom line: if you want to ensure everything and everyone is happy, see Tamara !<//review>

<text>When you go to some florists, the people who work there simply work there.  At Simi Valley Flowers and gifts, they give something more.  Like a bit of artistic talent.  All I did was outline the colors I wanted in the arrangement and pick a vase.  They did the rest.  You can't ask for nicer people who actually know how to put together an arrangement.  I had a wonderful experience!!</text>< Pics>

<review>Let me start out by saying that Conroy's is the ABSOLUTE BEST.! My Fiance' gets me flowers from there a lot. On the day that we went in to get our quote, myself & my Fiance' felt warm & welcomed as if we were inside Tamara's home. She took her time with us & talked us through everything that she thought would look great for our Wedding. She takes such pride in what she does. She doesn't rush you through anything. Whenever I have a question about anything, I can just ask her & she will answer it promptly & professionally/ I LOVE Conroy's.!

Thank You SO Much Tamara. <3< /review>< pics>

This place is a mess. All the fresh flowers are in buckets on the floor and there arent6any working coolers to keep the flowers fresh. It smells awful in the store. The customer service is horrific and Rude .I asked for a refund for a vase arrangement I  ordered to be delivered the day prior.because the flowers were withered and dying. The owner refused my refund. I will never use Conroys in Simi Valley, Ca ever again. I guess the the reputation of this establishment over exceeds itself. They will never change. What a shame. This is what has destroyed the floral market here in Simu Valley, Ca.< /text>

<Review>Great service and products. Was in a bind getting on a plane with just minutes to get an order for delivery and called Tammy at Conroys and asked her to put something together for my wife. She asked some questions to get a sense about what her likes were and she nailed it. My wife LOVED the basket and this will be my number one go to place from here on!!!!</Review><response>None< /response><Date>1501781697155< /Date><Pics>None< /Pics><name>bill7873< /name></record></dataset><record>

<text>Ordered a floral arrangement in a Red Vase with Pink Roses and various filler flowers. Received Clear vase with Red Roses, not pink as ordered. They died 2 days later. I later found out the owner goes to local cemeteries and picks up the left behind bouquets and re-sells the flowers..I must have been one of the Re-gifted customers. Buyer be ware.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I'm out of the Simi Valley area by hundreds of miles but I've ordered arrangements with this Conroy's Florist a number of times.  Each time they make it happen; timing of delivery is on target, customer care is exceptional and the floral arrangements are spot-on beautiful and fresh.  Oh, and the flowers last for days beyond the typical wilt limit of other florists.  Good stuff right here !!<//Text><Date>1493174158646< /Date>< GmapID>

These guys are absolutely amazing. Have them create you a beautiful arrangement for those special occasions and you won't be disappointed. My wife's jaw dropped when she saw what you guys made for her for our 10 year anniversary.. "i got the credit though" haha.</review>

<Review>Amazing customer service!!  Albert tried to deliver, but no one was home.  He was concerned about the heat and said he'd swing back by in an hour to see if they were received.  I then found out the family was out of town for two days.  I called the shop and Tammara said she'd have Albert pick them up and would remake the flowers and deliver in two days - at no extra charge!  Above and beyond!  Thank you!!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80e82ec56bf92cc7:0xf6b0222c07e8127c</gmap_id>< name>

Website and store windows show that this flower shop opens at 8am. I waited until 810 and no one showed up. Everything was dark inside and locked up. Maybe they are closed for construction.< /Text>

<Text>I ordered flowers by phone for my cousin that just had surgery and was recovering at home. Tamara was so helpful. She help me think of the perfect wording to put on my note and was able to deliver on that same day. She send me a picture of the beautiful flower arrangement befor they were delivered. The price was very reasonable. The Cerry on top was that the delivery was free. I recommend Conroy's flowers. I will order from them again soon!< /Text>< pics>

No compliment here- I placed two orders to be delivered on a Friday. Did not hear from the recipient that they had received the plant arrangement which was sent in Sympathy of a loved ones passing. I finally called Conroy's on Sunday to inquire that the two orders had been delivered. I was told that they would need to confirm delivery and would call me back. I received email confirmation later on Sunday that showed the deliveries were made on Friday. Later on Sunday, the recipients both sent texts to me saying they had received plants. SO disappointed that my order which was specifically requested for Friday delivery was not delivered until Sunday and only because I called Conroy's to ask about my order. I will NOT use Conroy's again.<//Text>

Really Bad experience. My boyfriend bought me flowers for my bday and he said I got a different design at the end,he didnt chose what I receive. Then he paid a teddy bear to come with the flowers and some balloons and I didn't get that, and  the lady charged him 2 times by mistake. I called to see what happened and she said the driver forgot the teddy bear and she was going to put the money back from the 2 times she charged him, and I will receive the rest of items that supposed to come with the flowers. It's been 25 days and I didnt get anything!< /Text>

Ordered online for my mom's birthday and went with them because they are in her town and had good reviews. Ordered on a Tuesday for Friday delivery. Didn't deliver on Friday. Didn't deliver on Saturday. Didn't deliver on Monday. Didn't let me know that they weren't delivering. I called on Tuesday to see what was wrong. The designer was perplexed as to why the arrangement I had ordered was still there. The driver asked if I was delivering to a company, rather than a home. Finally delivered on Tuesday but, since it was made on Friday, the flowers were dead by Tuesday night. No offer for a refund or discount. No apology from the store. Just received a delivery notice TODAY, over a month later, via email. Won't be using them next time.<//review>

DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS. Horrible delivery service. I was sadly stuck away from my girlfriend on our 2 year anniversary as I am stationed away from her. I ordered for same day delivery a little before noon, recieved my confirmation email. Two hours later, i attempted to call & find out the delivery time and no one answered the phone and the voicemail was full, i called about 15 times between 2pm and 7pm which was when they were supposed to close. They never answered, and then called my girlfriend the next day telling her they came and she wasn't home, when she was right next to the front door working on her computer the whole day. They never attempted to call me or her yesterday and never showed up as they said they did. They did not give me trouble with refunding my money, but did not even offer up an apology. They must feel it's not a big deal sadly. Won't ever use this service again. Also, i ordered from them before on Valentines day for my gf while i was away for same day delivery, and the flowers didn't arrive until the next day, I thought maybe it was because of the holiday so I gave them another shot, but obviously this is a regular occurrence for them, horrible service.<//review>

<text>BAD NEWS FLORIST
I ordered a particular arrangement shown online.  These were for my mother's funeral..They were never delivered and I was not informed---weeks later I found out and asked for a refund---17 calls and 6 weeks later after speaking to 7 different people--was put on hold 40 minutes and hung up on 3 times---then they offered me store credit.   Big Deal---mom's in the ground and her flowers never got there.  And to top it off, they were rude, sarcastic and demeaning to me on the phone.  No apology was ever offered.  What the heck is wrong with these people?  Be careful if you do business with this place, and good luck, you're gonna need it.<//text>< Resp>

The flower arrangement that I had ordered online was not the same one that was delivered. The amount of flowers were a lot less than what I had paid for. In addition to the flower count, the vase was completely different than the one paid for online.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Hanna of Conroy's came to my rescue on my daughter's wedding day.  I was short a vase, 3 boutineers, and one money dance bag.  I sent her a pics of the vase and boutineer i needed.  She came to my rescue within a couple of hours.  Saved the day! And.... We didnt have a pouch/bag/sachel for my daughter's money dance.  She found a beautiful peice of satin and on the spot put together a stunning bag... You wld never know it didn't come from a bridal shop.  I will never forget her help on "The Day Of".  And the price was so reasonable😊  I trust and highly recommend Conroy's of Simi... Thanks Hanna ❤</Text><userid>111530667298357535988<//userid></record>

< Review>
So I never really do reviews but conroy’s Simi Valley definently deserves one.  I called about 15 mins before I arrived and waited for about 5 mins while the girl finished up my order. They were extremely friendly and did a wonderful job on an arrangement for my mom (she was having a tough day and flowers always make it better). I will use them for all my future flower needs 😃</Review>

<text>I screwed up.  My wife was furious, and I was desperate to make things right again.  Called Conroy's Simi valley, and they were a life saver (and probably a marriage saver!)  They took care of every thing fast, and professional.  I'm a typical guy, and have no idea about flowers, but they made a beautiful arrangement, helped me with the card, and were out here on the same day.  These guys have my business for life!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Tamara went over the call of duty for my family.  I called all flower shops in simi valley and Conroys was the only shop that would complete my order for my relatives funeral.  They made the time to buy the special flowers we were looking for and delivered in such a short notice.  I can't thank them enough for treating us like family at a time when it was truly needed.</Review>< pics>

I called Conroy' s  and spoke to Tamara who I have worked with before, I had ordered 3 long stem red roses which where very beautiful. I will be returning early this Friday to pick up another one for my recently deceased mother.I know my mother approved of the other red roses I purchased for her funeral which was just this last week .What a way to end and start off the year. Thanks Conroy's and Tamara for being there through my rough time,Robert Snook
Dear Tamara,   Its your buddy Robert Snook I just wanted to say thank you again for the beautiful rose,sent pictures of it to my wife and daughter in India before they passed out for the night, and they both thank you from the bottom of all our big hearts, your a heaven sent artistical angel Tamara,Thank you for being there during these very tough times,Love and hugs The Snook family</review>

If I could do a zero I would...They were to provide flowers (white lily) for my wife's memorial service in Moorpark last June. The flowers never made it...I've been in touch with them and promised a refund, no refund ever sent...so now this post...Well it's been a year since Conroys failed me..I was contacted by the owner and promised a refund , NEVER happened...< /Review>

< Review>
As a recently former employee of Conroys Simi valley. These two are thieves!  I have personally experienced these two,?They both confided in me about each other, their business practices their staff, everything. I went by Kat, they deserve all the complaints and more. They buy old flowers, they dont deliver most of the wire in orders, they steal flowers from assumption cemetery dumpsters to reuse them. They DO NOT PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES, i am owed over 3,000.00 my Son over 509.00, 3 friends of mine also worked there and are owed 300.00 + each. Tamara stole another' employees SS# then fraudulently opened a bloom net floral  account by completing a application with the other persons personal info and charged 17,000.00 then said it was a accident.  Tami used a different employees drivers license when she was pulled over by the police. Yes!!! She told the police her name was laurie and that is her license!!!! Somehow my license was used for their rental car which I know they had for over a month. Hertz came after me for payment thats how I found out. The investigator traced the card to them At US Bank Hemel Corp LLC Albert Mendez. Tamara also said they were fired by UFN because Per their email to Tami, Albert was calling up to 20X a day yelling at the reps calling them names. Tami orders old flowers for cheap thats why they die. She buys 90% of her vases from the dollar store and sells them as cut crystal. She uses dead, old, flowers for all funerals but uses a few fresh ones to make it look good. Tami also steals flowers from peoples yards and businesses here in Simi, TO, Camarillo, and Moorpark. She steals Hydrangea, Bird of Paradise, magnolia, box wood, Eucalyptus, Pittosporum, Orchids, succulents garden roses, Gardenia, seco palm, palm leaves, and more.  Tami aka tamara, Lisa, Jennifer mendez intentionally lies to customers and claims their flowers were delivered but they were not. Tami and Albert go as far as to pull up the customers recipients address on google earth, then proceeds to describe their house to them stating the only know the details if their home because they delivered the flowers personally or their best driver. Funerals, omg, if its an order out from out of state she will not even make the order, yet claim she did. When she receives boxes of flowers in she pulls dead flowers from the buckets and switches them out with the new flowers then calls to complain she received dead flowers. Now she gets a credit! She lies to everyone, every customer, she uses people until they figure her out. For 10 years she has ripped off customers, employees, cemeteries church's.?Tami and albert mendez have over 15 LLC in various names to move money around but claim their broke and cant pay employees. They invest money in a popular investment firm but yet have the nerve to borrow money from employees and never repay hem. They open LLC also to borrow money against credit, max it out then close it.  Tami ALWAYS HAS SAID THAT SHE IS THE DEVIL's MVP! Everything I stated is what I witnessed first hand, or was told rather confessed by Tami. Tami is in constant VICTIM MODE, she crys everyday to get people to feel sorry for her. Its an ACT FOLKS!!!!! I am always available for questions. Those customers who has been ripped off or have not yet been ripped off RUN!!!!!! She is SATAN's. All of you that have been ripped off, not refunded, over charged, non delivery, call the BBB, and the District Atty, and the City Manager of Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, call the police the labor board, And shut them down!</Review>

What an absolutely fabulous company. I had ordered a few items for a Hobie kayak, then sent a separate email asking about stock on something else. They notices based on my email that I ordered a part that would bot work with my kayak. What great attention to detail!  THANK YOU.< /Review>

We had a great experience at Headwaters. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. No pressure sales. It's great to be able to rent/demo a kayak before buying and they apply your rental cost to your purchase if you decide to buy one. Highly recommend anyone in the market for a decent kayak to go to Headwaters versus the big box stores.< /Text>

<text>Shop is clean, organized. Staff is professional, attentive, knowledgeable, friendly. I will send anyone who asks me to this shop for their kayak and water needs. My wife and I enjoyed the visit and experience.

Next day we took a kayak class and it was really fun. We learned a lot. Tiffani was our instructor and she was a delight to have as an instructor. Kudos to Headwaters Adventure Co., Thanks so much.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I bought a 2019 Hobie Passport here. I was impressed with their customer service and their knowledge of the product they carry. This was the first higher end kayak that I have bought so it was nice to have a helpful staff to educate me on what I might need with my purchase.<//review>

<text>A very small store with very big knowledge and personality. They offer great customer service.They don't have multiple selections of everything but they have everything you need which makes them unique. They offer items of quality that you could buy online but won't find at the larger stores in town. I prefer supporting a smaller local business over a large national any day but especially when the service is exceptional.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I have been a paddler for many years and without a local kayak company. It is nice to have Headwaters here. In my opinion they carry some of the best paddling gear available including Jackson kayaks, Kokatat and Werner paddles. They have a great crew. I am thankful to have them here.< /Review>

Both our dry-suits fit perfectly! Few dealers have the knowledge to properly fit a custom technical suit like this. Thank you! ~_^< /Text>

BE VERY CAREFUL. THIS BUSINESS IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. IF YOU CANCEL FOR ANY REASON THEY WILL KEEP YOUR MONEY AND TRY TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD AND PLAY GAMES. DO NOT FOR ANY REASON DO BUSINESS WITH THEM UNLESS YOU ARE 100 % CERTAIN YOU CAN ATTEND.<//review>

Amazing track. Always enjoy the experience there. Great safety protocol. Usually stay in the Palm Desert area overnight, and cruise to the track in the morning.

Mid day track break there is a gas station and good food about 10 min west of the track.< /review>

Fantastic racing oasis in the middle of the desert! Love the cabins and the tracks many amenities. The staff has been very pleasant to interact with and our stay has been nothing but amazing. Sure was worth the 3 hour drive from Phoenix!<//text>

Clean and well organized cabins. Even if you choose to bring your own bed sheets and towels, the kitchenette is well equipped. See the list in the pictures below. Sofa bed and bed are in 2 different rooms: good opportunity to share the cabin with another racer.< /Review>

Everything about this place was more than expected! Went out to the track for the weekend with the family and noticeably from the entrance this place was cleaner than anyone could expect. Just as some are probably worried about staying in a nasty hotel, this was completely opposite. The kitchen was clean, the bathrooms not a spec, floors were clean, rooms and bed were emaculate. The bed was the most comfortable bed ive ever slept in. The rules while on the property are posted and very clear!  Nice deck you can sit outside and unwind, watch the sun rise or set. I didnt see a place you could BBQ however, I saw other people bring their own BBQ grill and there is a fully equipped kitchen for all your cooking needs. Loved and enjoyed our stay here.
Would definitely recommend this place 🏆❤

FYI * the office sells approx 20lb bags of ice for 7.00!< /review>

<Text>Been to CVR since Micky first opened up. Be it in my Z06, or on a bike, I enjoy CVR. I've been in the cabin's (they're great, btw.)
I've gone clockwise & counter clockwise. (Sometimes, on the SAME DAY.)
(It's great to have the WHOLE track to yourself!)
Sometimes, sand can blow over the track. Bummer, but not something that can be controlled. I need to get back there, soon.
Hold me a spot...:)</Text><user_id>109930379707388036464< /user_id>< rating>

Great Track for Motorcycle and Car Enthusiasts 👍 they also have cabins that you can reserve for overnight stays. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Downside is they are far away from the nearest hospital Facilites so if you go down on the track you can expect a hour transport via AMR Ambulance services..<//Review>

<Review>Always a great experience at Chuckwalla Raceway! The track staff is wonderful and the track is very well maintained. The Cabins are a wonderful addition. Perfect place to unwind and rest up after eventful day at the track. Clean, Comfortable, and quiet. Waking up to copper colored mountains are blissful.<//Review>< Response>

<review>Chuckie is an AWESOME and challenging track,especially clockwise going into turn 9! If you don't have an RV,the cabins are absolutely better than most hotels! All the comforts of home including fast WIFI and VERY clean and priced just right. Staff was very polite and professional. It's part of our annual Track Days! Its in the middle of nowhere which makes sitting around the campfire under the stars,relaxing. Make sure you bring lots of fuel,food and water because the nearest stores are 25 miles away!<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6Exg-Q3rrjzfgWK-ooNE12eqKZ2R5PqoOcwSm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80d08cbaa5ebe227:0xc2fb03a9d1969b4b< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful cabins. Kitchenettes with full-size fridge and cooktop, tons of storage, pets welcome, flat screen with HDMI hookup, pullout sofa in the living room, fire pits. Even if you aren't a racer, it's a fantastic home base for Joshua Tree excursions or simply an escape.< /text>

Have been to Chuckwalla Valley Raceway several times with NASA AZ for racing. The Owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. Track is wide, good pavement, plenty of run off for racing and beginner HPDE drivers. Restrooms and showers in paddock area and plenty of space for race trailers, RV's, etc. Bring all your supplies with you, food, water, fuel, etc for the weekend. The nearest gas station is 25 miles and grocery store in 51 miles. Its a long drive from Texas, but planning to go back.<//text>

I absolutely LOVE this track.   Super cool people and a lot of fun.  Was in an accident (on the street, not the track) so I've been out a while, but I just started coming back.   My favorite place to race in SoCal.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>While I never drove a single mile here, I must say the people of this track are truly wonderful, kind people who helped us when we were completely stranded! We had run out of gas on I-10, and though we'd brought bikes, the closest gas station was 20 miles away. After a few quick calls, we biked down to the track where Warren loaded us into his truck, loaned us a gas can, and sold us the few gallons we were short. Not to leave a job half done, he drove us (and our bikes) back to our Jeep, saving us the return bike ride.

The office lady was also very helpful and the grounds, beautifully maintained. There were several cabins in the front that you could rent, a fenced in dog area, tent camping, and a new motocross track! I'm not a racer, but this place is a little oasis in the Desert Center.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I've ridden Chuckwalla at a couple of motorcycle trackdays. It's pretty f'n hot out there in June and July. Also rode in November and it was perfect.....so try to go then.

As far as the track layout, it's a blast and several sections are really unique. Take it easy until you do a bunch of laps, and I mean a bunch.

Ride safe.</Text>< pictures>

April 2013 - Jason Pridmore Star School - Went with my buddy Lincoln Bridges and had an absolute blast!  He on his F800ST and I on my FZ1 Gen1.  The track has been repaved and smooth as silk everywhere.  The school was run very professionally and the 2up ride w/Jason on his GSXR was a hoot.

Will recommend to everyone and go again soon!</review>

I had the unfortunate event of getting stranded with no gas and I thought Mr. McGee's station had gas but it didn't. Thankfully I knew about this place because of race events from friends and they actually sell gas here. The gas is about $5.73 but I'm so grateful I would've been stuck here and had to pay a stupid tow service</text>

(Translated by Google) Just made the ground, there was no warning, the track was opened as usual without maintenance, and 16 of the 30 cars fell, very irresponsible to the drivers!

刚做了地面，没有任何警示，赛道没有维护好就照常开业，三十辆车摔了16辆，对车手非常不负责！< /Text>

<Text>I really really like this building. If you are thinking of moving in here, I have some points that might be useful as me and my boyfriend were looking through 30+ high rises when we tried to move.
The points in order are gym, spa, roof, service, room amenities,  deliveries, location, things this apartment doesn't have/cons.

- The gym is great. There are a good selection of weight machines and cardio machines as well as ropes and a heavy bag outdoors. There is also a small artificial turf area to pull/push sleds. There isn't a free Olympic weight bar set, but there is a Smith machine with two degrees of freedom rather than the typical one. The gym is open 24/7.
- The spa area is extremely pleasent. There is a steam room and a sauna and a Jacuzzi which are usually not too packed. It closes at 10:00pm right now, but I'm not sure if that is a COVID thing.
- The views are spectacular both from the rooms and from the roof. Speaking of the roof, there is a pool table, shuffle board table, and bocce ball court all overlooking the salesforce tower/park. The views from the roof (35th floor) are absolutely gorgeous and you can sit and study/do work with the wifi up there and look out at any direction around the building.
- The rooms are really nice and the amenities are super modern. There is a gas stove, and in the two br, there is one bath/shower and one huge walk in shower. There is also AC and heating which is suprisingly nice. The balcony is large enough to fit a small table and some chairs (though I must say the height still makes me a little scared). Everything has a really clean modern look, and there is a good amount of space bar the pillar in the middle of the living room that can be a little annoying to plan around (this is for the D apartments).
- The service people are super prompt and friendly. I was surprised when someone showed up at my door to replace a key because I had only submitted the ticket 10 or so minutes prior. The front desk people are also SUPER friendly and very helpful with anything that goes wrong. They were especially nice considering the COVID precautions regarding getting packages.
- Speaking of packages, there is an amazon locker on the first floor that you have to get your packages from and a mail room next to that. But deliveries such as DoorDash, UberEats, or Amazon Prime Now are delivered to your door which is really convenient.
- The location is really quite. We live above a freeway yet cannot hear anything other than the occasional police siren. There are some really great restaurants one or so blocks away, and salesforce park is a great place to walk through on a nice day. And I hope you like walking because parking is $500 a month, but the valet is really nice. And you can rent teslas for $28ish an hour.
- There are some things this apartment doesn't have. There is no pool. There aren't free Olympic bar weight sets. Packages aren't brought to your door. If you have friends visit, there is parking down the street for $20 a day or you can park in valet in the building for $40 a day. You can, if you are very lucky, park on the street, but there is street sweeping Mon, Wed, and Fri and the tickets are painful. There's no Foosball table. The fridge door doesn't have a magnet or any way to close so sometimes it stays slightly open and then beeps forever (this is the ultimate first world problem, I know). Trash gets picked up form your door everyday and you have no option to throw things away yourself down the shoot (whether this is a pro/con is up to you). If it is a busy time of day (Friday nights etc.), or someone is moving, or the it's trash pickup time, the elevators can take quite a bit, but it's (almost) never egregious. There is also little counter space.

Conclusion, I really like this place for all the reasons listed above. We pro/con-ed every high rise within our price range (with our personal criteria), and this came out clearly on top. Granted we got it at a COVID discount, but at the end of our lease, if we decide to stay in San Francisco, we would definitely like to stay here.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUABL4L2fePzOpzLV3JKmu-KG6XQmrT--WvRaP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMS7yKLPMYb_TM-5rg_M7UQBqskYQ99oFD4abVs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

We’ve lived at 33T for a year and loved it. It’s a beautiful building, with efficient apartments, and great amenities. The view from living room on the 35th floor is amazing. So if you - like myself - work from home a lot, this is the place to be.

We consider moving back in, in a few months, after a stint in Europe.

If there’s anything we’d like to see when we get back, it would be a coffee machine on the 35th floor ;)< /Review>

Moved in a month ago, and the staff made everything really easy. Views from every unit are great (classic SF skylines in every direction), and my unit was clean and in working order. There are some typical big building issues (elevator doesn't come instantly, roof deck accidentally locked and have to find someone to open it, trash schedule not communicated perfectly) but I don't think any rental building gets those things 100%. At least not any that aren't at the top of the price range. 33 Tehama is squarely at the "very very nice, entry level luxury" level.</Review>

Highly recommend. I lived in this apartments for 5 months and never faced any issues. Couple of my colleagues used to live in nearby apartments which are taller and expensive and their room space was not as good as mine. The terrace is a great place to hangout with beautiful views. Parking is bit expensive comparatively but the street has good free spots.< /Text>

<review>33 Tehama is a world class apartment building with the best amenities, features, and views among the newest tall buildings in SF.
The sound-proof apartments are super classy, the management team responsive, and the location amazing, both really close to downtown and the waterfront.
All the services are included, such as valet 24/7, butler,  maintenance.
I moved here about 3 months ago and  my teenage son and I are having a great time.<//review><time>1568839442726< /time>< Pictures>

Disclaimer: I never lived in 33 Tehama; this review is purely based on my experiences with the leasing office.

I spent about a month looking for a new place to stay. I didn't end up going with 33 Tehama, mainly because the units were a bit too small for my liking, but everyone in the leasing office was so nice to me that I felt compelled to leave a good review.

Gia, Mia, Lily, and Deborah were all involved at some point, and I received nothing but good service from them. They were always accommodating even when I visited with little or no heads up. They made sure the leasing terms were always consistent and communicated to me, and I never got the impression they were somehow trying to "snake" me like some of the other leasing offices I had interacted with. They were all very responsive and I never had any trouble working with them.

I wish I could have gone with them - the units were modern, finish was nice, and the views from the higher floor units I was looking at were gorgeous! Their rooftop area is pretty epic too. A huge thank you to everyone who accommodated me in the leasing office!</review>

The building is nice. Management does some extra things to cater to residents, like free social outings, but often fail to execute them well, Ie) brunch food delivered around dinner time, not setting up a zoom link for a virtual happy hour, not communicating building updates, etc. The building has shut down almost all amenities, including bbq grills with no real plan to communicate their reopening. Front desk staff hardly answer the phone.  I often reach out with questions and have to follow up for answers. It feels like management is either in over their head or have no accountability to their residents. I’ve submitted maintenance requests without responses. While the people are nice, it is not run well and the results are felt and commiserated by many residents. Has lots of potential, but has not met expectations. Hope it does for everyone’s benefit.</Review>

I lived here with a roommate for a few months and the rooms and amenities are nice... but don't expect to get your security deposit back.

It's been months since we've moved out and management has refused to refund our security deposit. After back and forth communication for weeks, they informed us that they had sent out the deposit, but somehow, to the completely wrong address. We've given them the correct address several times prior.

Despite immediately notifying them that they had used the wrong address and following up for several weeks, they have refused to acknowledge or resolve the issue and we still do not have our security deposit.</review>

Overrated for the price. Appliances are poor quality and cheap. People leave trash right outside there doors so floors smell awful everyday. Bugs (gnats) in the gym that annoy workouts. Nice rooftop but not much besides that. Valet area smells because trash room door is always open. Is in an alley and nothing  is open nearby on weekends. Need to have most things delivered. I was in temp housing and would never think about living here. A lot better options in the area.<//Text>

We are happy to hear you like the rooftop. 33 Tehama is located near just a block away from the Financial District which does tend to cater to the Monday-Friday customers, however their are lots of new retail and restaurants opening just a block away including the Transbay terminal (will include 35 new businesses!) . We also recommend checking out the Ferry Building on the weekends for amazing food and a famous farmers market on Saturdays. Thank you for letting us know about the gnats we had pest control come out today to remove them. Valet Living is a service at 33 Tehama for convenience to remove trash right from your doorstep, we are sorry to hear you did not enjoy the service and we appreciate the feedback. The trashroom is connected to our loading dock and we are trying our best to make sure it is always clean and smelling good. We will continue to montoir this area.

There are A LOT of issues at this building - they will make you a lot of promises during the viewings but you will get none of it.

First, our bathroom cabinet was broken and didn’t have doors and we were told they would be replaced the week after.
It’s now been 20 days since move-in and after at least 10 emails and calls to the property manager we still have not received our cabinets or any information on when they will arrive. All we hear everyday is "today was so busy with viewing so let me get back to you tomorrow" (viewings where they promise you all the great things and receive nothing when you actually move-in)

Second, the Hello Alfred serviced that we were promised (which is included in the rent that we are paying for the apartment) told us that there are currently no Alfreds available and that they will let us know when they do get something available in the future.

This is ridiculous as this a service we are paying for and haven’t received it 20 days out of the 30 days in which we have paid for it within our rent. The number of residents in the building is clear - so having us move in 20 days ago and increasing the number of residents by 1 should not make a difference. If we are paying for this service and it was advertised to us during our viewings, this answer is truly unacceptable.

Third, one of the biggest issues is that the treatment we have been receiving does not resemble a “luxury residential building” worth almost $5,000 a month. We cannot get a hold of anyone to actually answer and solve our issues - such as the cabinets and hello Alfred and on top of that we were trapped inside the elevator when it suddenly DROPPED DOWN 2 FLOORS last Saturday and went into emergency mode. Out of all of the luxury residential buildings I have lived in I can honestly say this has never happened to me!!

After you move in no one replies to any of your calls, emails, or any in person attempt to convey your problems. You will definitely be paying 5-star rent to receive a 1-star treatment where they treat you like they are the ones paying you to live there. Stay far away</Review>

Yes, it is. Measure your apartment before you move in and you will see. We were told that our bedroom was 13’ x 10’ but no, it actual dimensions were 13’ x 8.6’ a full 16” off along one wall. Did they compensate us for that? No. It was a nightmare trying to find furniture for that wall. Good thing we measured before we moved in because we planned on getting a queen bed but even that would not fit. We downsized to a full size bed and even then we could not fit two night stands without having to go to multiple furniture stores to find ones under 23 inches.

The entire leasing process was flawed and very amateurish with obvious errors in our lease that we had to point out to management, such as the incorrect dates, etc. The lack of communication from management was also a major issue and we did not receive the corrected lease until the morning we were supposed to move in. And when we moved in we only received half of our keys. One set had a fob and mail key while the other set had a fob and gym key.

We decided to stay positive and embrace the location and amenities while ignoring hassles faced so far. Unfortunately, our optimism was met with a never ending carousel of elevator issues. Five weeks and still not a single day where the elevators are functioning properly.
And to add insult to injury, managements compensation to all tenants was a $25 Amazon gift card. Seriously? We are all paying an average of $4-6k a month to live here. That is way to little to turn a blind eye to everything I have described. We all deserve money off our rent until the elevators are fixed.

33 Tehama is a beautiful building, we love the employees here, and there are great amenities... however do not let It distract you from the bigger issues.

I will update this post at our 6 month mark with hopefully a more positive review.

*Latest Update* the management has gone through a complete overhaul and things seem to be getting better. That said, we still moved out of the building.</Review>< Pictures>

<date>1592586021217<//date><rate>3</rate><review>I've been living here for about 10 months now and I think I got a differentiated view on the living experience. So let me first start with the upsides:
+ The apartments are generally pretty and have gorgeous views especially on the higher floors
+ Washer / dryer in unit, large bathrooms and built-in storage cabinets are great
+ The gym equipment and the jacuzzi are great

But unfortunately there are a lot of things here that keep putting a negative touch on the experience:
- Management is highly intransparent and unresponsive once you move in. A few explanations on why I say that. Since COVID-19, all amenities have been closed until further notice. Any questions regarding the timing of reopening are ignored. I tried to post about this on the (management reviewed / censored) community board two or three times and the post never even was put up. Requests to fix small things in the apartment take days. A day after I moved in I realized the closets wouldn't close properly but my ask to have this reflected on my inspection form was ignored and never answered.
- The place is generally overpriced, especially now with COVID. You pay a significant premium for the rooftop, the gym, the spa, valet etc. But while all those services have been cut, the rent has not been adjusted for it, so margin improvements from reduced utility overhead, reduce cleaning and maintenance etc. flow into Greystar's P&L and not back to the customers (questions regarding this have also been blocked from the community portal)
- Many of the staff here are very kind and open, but the leasing staff is grim and don't care about the residents once they move in (a nice smile in the hallway and a hello is not that difficult and should be standard etiquette in a luxury building)

So overall it's a nice building and as an international it's a great opportunity to find a place quickly if you haven't built up your credit score yet. But definitely not a place to stay for long.<//review>< pics>

33 Tehama is an amazing place to live in the SF area. The staff are very professional and easy to talk to. In my opinion, they have the best amenities, which can be found on the 35th floor and I use it all the time. They also have occasional resident events and it’s always good to get to know your neighbors. I’ll definitely renew my lease when it’s up. Thank you 33 Tehama for everything you guys do here.< /review>

<text>I’ve lived in many places in SF, but none have compared to the experience I’ve had at 33 Tehama. The amenities are absolutely incredible and the location is fantastic. To top it all off, the management team has been responsive and helpful with everything I need. The application experience was seamless and easy and all of my questions were answered quickly. I love having concierge and a friendly familiar face when walking in. I also love the valet parking!! Nothing beats walking down to your car and having it ready to go.</text><user_name>Janelle Schofield</user_name>< time>

<text>There are good things. But can you imagine how upsetting it is when you  can't sleep at 3:30 am because your neighbor is playing their favorite music loudly? I wonder why the wall doesn't seem to isolate sound at all. I wonder why the management team does nothing after I reported this more than once. But most strangely, I wonder why our neighbors at 20K never seem to need any sleep.</text>< gmap_id>

The neighborhood can't be beat since it is so convenient for work and social life, and the rooftop is the icing on the cake!  I would highly recommend checking this building out and if you can, calling it your next home!<//text>

<review>For the love of god turn off that god awful lighting you just added as an after thought to supposedly attract attention because you can’t compete with the beautiful and better buildings around you. It is an eye sore for the neighbors especially when we’re trying to sleep and it’s shining in your face all night that you wake up with a migraine. At least if the design and colors were pretty it might be tolerable. Bad bad eye. Take it down!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Elevators do not work, staff is honestly really nice, but the elevator situation is beyond ridiculous. Without exaggeration, it takes 20 minutes to get downstairs at times. The leasing staff will take days to respond to requests, the apartments are tiny and expensive, and half of the time the amenities are not available. When I first moved in, the leasing staff tried to charge me $500 a day to use the BBQ.

I do want to mention how nice the staff is, and I feel terrible for writing this review, but I would want to know this as a future resident.<//Review>

My experience as a customer has never been worse then how I've been treated at 33 Tehama Apartments in San Francisco. The leasing team will treat you like you deserve to be treated, tell you everything you need to hear until you sign on the dotted line and then once they have the leverage and you're locked in... then they totally forget about what customer sanctification is. Their lack of response to customer requests is embarrassing. Their lack of dignity and trustworthiness is even worse.

Nice new building but the management, leasing team, and ownership really need a wake up call. Start treating your customers the way they want and expect to be treated especially when they are paying ~$4K -$15K/ Month to live in a small 1-2 bedroom apartment (granted these absurd rates exist elsewhere in SF as well).

VERY disappointed with the Greystar team and with their down right bad business behavior. Stuck in my lease. Will amend with updates for better or worse. I'd expect many more bad reviews to follow as many other residents have only just moved in and are starting to voice their frustrations to one another. Hopefully they start to speak up as well to help warn the greater world wide web. Go take your hard earned money elsewhere, you'll be disappointed when they you realize halfway into your lease that they are going to screw you too.</text>

<user_name>Marie Washer</user_name><Review>I highly advise against 33 Tehama. I lived in this building for 3 months and had to leave unexpectedly due to an immigration issue. I was going to receive important mail at 33 Tehama, for which the management confirmed that was not a problem. Once they received my mail, 33 Tehama returned it to sender after just a few days, without even trying to call me. USPS has tried to deliver it twice and they pushed it back, while telling me it was no problem to receive mail at that address.

They are untrustworthy and it's partly because of these people that I've been chasing out USPS for over a month for immigration-related documents.

If you're looking for a building management that doesn't give a damn about you and will lie to your face, you've found the place. I would give them 0 stars if I could, I've lost countless hours now because of these people.

REPLY TO OWNER:
This is incorrect, my documents were not intercepted. The documents that were given to me were irrelevant. I have now received a tracking number showing that my immigration document was returned to USPS on 2 occasions by 33 Tehama.<//Review>< Rating>

Management is sleazy and inept. Based on my rough calculations, usable square footage was only ~60% of the advertised amount. Small-sized appliances are a giant pain.

Avoid this place at all costs. The apartment is overpriced for what you get and moving out has been a horror show.

We moved out early due to job relocation. Two months before moving out, we negotiated the terms of the lease break and had multiple written confirmations of these terms. A month after we moved out, they refused to give us back our security deposit because they decide they did not like the terms they had agreed to and wanted more money.

During the move out process, they violated Civil Code by refusing to honor our request for an inspection. They then sent us a bill for wildly inflated cleaning charges without any support as to why the charges were so high.

To add to the misery, their accounting system appears to be broken, and shows us as having made late rent payments almost every month we lived there even though every payment was made in full and on time and I had the bank records to prove it. They have sent us multiple bills since moving out for different amounts and their accounts receivable department admitted their accounting system wasn’t working correctly, but he was unable to do anything about it.

I regret living here. Please don’t make the same mistake that I did.< /review>

I love where I live!  33 Tehama honestly blew me away. Everything is so easy and effortless and that started with the staff. I thought I came in with a lot of questions on my tour, but they had answers for everything and more- so accommodating. It was an easy choice for me. And as someone who works equally as much at home as the office, I found the on-site amenities to be so rewarding after a long day. The fitness center and spa are clean and private, but my favorite amenity is the rooftop for those views (with a glass of wine in hand). Cheers!</Text>

<text>PROS: awesome layout (for “F” units), location, amenities, maintenance is great, leasing office is responsive and helpful.

CONS: random rise in fees, risky unsafe behavior by valet (there was a car accident, apparently due to a drunk valet driver), no towels or water in spa (always empty, 7/7 times in a row for each visit), front door is not secure (guests let in without key entry)

I love the building but unsure of safety.< /text>< Rate>

Decided to review on Google since my posts in the community portal were deleted by the building (yay censorship?).

Great location and decent amenities, but horribly managed. We’ve been living here for over a month now and the elevators are constantly broken and out of service. There are only 3 elevators to service 35 floors so prepare for extremely long delays and wait times. It adds to my commute and every resident in the building always talks about how horrible it is.

Trash rooms are locked on every floor and they require you to leave it in front of your door for pick up. The catch is that they will leave some items out in front of our door for days since we can’t throw it away ourselves. In our community portal, the building said this was to avoid fees that would be passed on to us (sounds like a threat honestly) due to mixed trash. I’ve seen the trash area in the loading dock and at the time it was just a big heaping pile of mixed garbage anyways. The hallways smell sometimes because of this.

The roof lounge closes at 11PM and security will kick you out. It makes us both feel like we’re toddlers in a day care! If we pay so much rent, why can I not enjoy a late night lounge or throw away my own trash?

Absolutely anyone can get into the building. You need a key to get in the door (but always open) and after that you can go anywhere.

Reserving amenities costs $500+

IF YOU’RE A CURRENT RESIDENT PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW. The more public reviews, the more likely they are to do something about it.<//review>

We are sorry to hear you have had a not so positive experience with elevators and valet living trash service. The elevators are currently being worked on. Thank you for your patience as the repairs are being completed. We will continue to email updates on the community portal. There are several reasons our community chooses to use the valet living trash service program. Some reasons include lower trash bills as we can keep the trash and recycle separate, there are no clogged trash chutes, and convenience for not having to carry heavy trash down the halls. Yes, we have a rooftop that is open to all in the community to use, as this is a popular area we have the hours of 7am-11pm in place for a few reasons such as the nightly deep clean, as well as making sure the nearby apartments do not have any issues with noise late in the evening. Thank you for your feedback about the controlled access/entry and if you would like to discuss any of these items further we would be happy to set up an appointment or take a call, or feel free to pop into the leasing office.

My girlfriend and I are residence here at 33 Tehama and let me start off by first saying that the property is gorgeous and the rooftop on the 35th floor is absolutely breathtaking. There are so many different and amenities like a spa, steam room, sauna and my favorite a hot tub. I had some friends over this weekend and the weather was perfect on the rooftop with a beautiful sunset. Although talking to other residents, we all agreed that shutting down the 35th floor rooftop at 11:00 is a little too early. It is however understandable during the week but at least Friday and Saturday nights would be better if it stayed open until 12:00. Allow me to say one thing that is for sure, they hired new security in the lobby and if I may shed some light on the new guy at the desk ((Anthony)). He is absolutely fantastic! Very friendly welcoming young man and very professional. From talking to other residents who live here he has been a topic of conversation amongst us all. Great new hire, we all really like him alot!! With all that being said, 33 Tehama is a great fit and a nice place to live.< /review>

This is not a bad place to live but maybe not for the money you pay. There are a couple of problems you might have here. One is the noise from the nearby freeway which sometimes could wake you up in the middle of the night if you are a light sleeper. The other is that the fab (key) malfunctions quite often and if this happens late in the evening you could have a hard time getting in your unit. And smoke detecters/alarms are little too sensitive.<//Review>

<text>I have lived in 33 Tehama for 1.5 years when I first moved to SF. I enjoyed my experience here overall. I am moving out soon to a similar building (399 Fremont), but I wanted to offer a hopefully objective review.

Pros
- The rooms are modern and has good amenities (washer&dryer, dish washer, microwave, AC, even cutting boards)
- The room layouts are quite good.
- Maintenance team is awesome! I had issues with my dishwasher (it just fell out one day), toilet clogging and door lock (ran out of battery). I filed a maintenance ticket and the issues were usually resolved within hours.
- The rooftop has great views and I love working from there one day a week (I ended up meeting one of my best friends here), Sauna, hot tub, gym are quite nice.
- The cleaning staff are extremely friendly and hard working.
- Cute dogs live in this building.
- Hello Alfred service is pretty nice. We like asking them to do our groceries. They also do a quick tidy-up which often brightens my day.

Things I didn't quite like:

- Noise. I get woken up at 4am on most nights. My room faces Tehama St, and the H rooms are right above the loading dock. Almost every day, an extremely loud truck comes by at 11pm and 4-5am to collect trash and load construction materials. This wakes me up on most nights, even when we shut all our windows and doors. My husband is a quite heavy sleeper and sometimes also wake up at 4am with that noise. Note that this would apply to room type H and also other rooms facing Tehama street (I talked to my neighbor who is considering breaking the lease because of this). My friend on the 20th floor also has this issue, so it doesn't help if you pick a taller floor. I considered moving to room A/B which might not have this problem, but I decided not to risk it in the end. This issue might be solvable if you sleep with ear plugs. I don't like that.
- The smoke detector is extremely sensitive, which makes cooking at home difficult. Often it fires when I sear a steak or a piece of chicken (It's not like I cook crazy dishes and burn everything). One of my neighbors now just cook with their door and window open to avoid this issue. I didn't want to do that since I don't want to set on the hallway's fire alarm. As a result, my husband and I eat out a lot :p
- Sometimes random things break in the building, such as the elevator. In early 2019 at least one elevator would be broken, sometimes 2 out fo the 3 available. This doesn't bother me too much because I am on the 5th floor, but I am sure it's inconvenient for higher floors.
- I am slightly concerned about the building security. The building lock broke for a month earlier this year. When it's not broken, people who don't live in the building follow residents in, and the front desk people seem to take a lot of breaks (They leave a clock thingy saying they'd be back in an hour, etc). Funny story, I was talking to a Caviar delivery guy n the elevator one day, and he said he remember this building because the front desk is always empty. I think front desk staff are definitely allowed to take breaks, though it'd be good to have shifts or something so they can take turns to be there (since the building claims 24/7 front desk). Rumor has it that there are drug dealers and homeless people coming into the building, though I have never experienced that so I don't know if that's made up.

I will update this review to include the move-out process after I officially move out. In future years, I would consider coming back to 33 Tehama to a room that does not face Tehama street.</text>< Rate>

<Review>Don't be misled by appearances. We have lived at 33 Tehama for 1 year and the management of this building is unprofessional and simply unhelpful. All buildings have their own pros and cons, but the difference can be made by how a building is managed. The 33 Tehama management team has no answer to any of their residents' concerns.

The building is situated next to a nightclub on Howard Str. We experienced a lot of noise from 11 PM - 2 AM from Thursday through Saturday, which basically means not being able to sleep for 3 nights every week.

The hot tub and barbecues have been out of service every few weeks.

The valet car service sounds nice, but pretty much means waiting for your car all the time.

Valet trash service means your neighbors trash in the hallways half of the day, including the terrible smell.

These are only a few items that definitely will impact your stay at 33 Tehama. There are so many other buildings that have the same luxury amenities and better management and prices!</Review><gmap_id>0x8085807c98439f1f:0x7a7ee82d784b3b8e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Please do NOT rent Greystar’s properties. Look up the property management company before you move in.

I hope my review can help you avoid Greystar so you won’t be fooled by them. I have lived in 33 Tehama managed by Greystar over half a year and it has been the worst experience ever. You pay hundreds dollars of extra fee every month in addition to your rent. And every thing is broken in 33 Tehama, you have to work with the maintenance to fix things every week.

And do NOT believe the 5 stars, Greystar asks tenants to give it a 5 star for some community rewards points.

People in Greystar’s 33 Tehama:
- The property manager is full of fake smiles and lack of basic management or communication skills. And most of other leasing crew and managers are part-time with high turn-over rate so no one cares if you live well here, other than making you signing the lease.
- The concierge, car valet crew and the cleaning crew are good and friendly though.

Here are the countless issues of Greystar’s 33 Tehama:
- There’s a nightclub right across the building, you will be listening to the super bass trying to fall asleep. Oh, the other side is the high way. Make your choice.
- They were repairing the elevator for months, most of the time there’s only 1 elevator working for a 35-floor building. You need to wait for 10 minutes and when it comes you are lucky if it has enough space for you.
- There was a severe gas leak happened on a Sunday, the whole building is evacuated by the Fire Department. People had to stand outside for 2 hours and wait another 1 hour to get back to their units with only 1 elevator working.
- The front gate was broken for months. Every one can get in without a key.
- The garage gate was broken, and still broken until right now.
- Very thin wall. You hear people talking and doing stuff.
- Chaotic small package room for a big building.
- Internet drops off at midnight very often.
- The Jacuzzi, steam room and other amenities stop working very often. People have received hundreds of the notice of these issues.
- The loading zone is also trash trunk zone.
- The trash trunks stay on the street as well, you can smell it all the time.
- They don’t allow tenants to toss their trash by themselves. Instead, you pay extra fee for “trash valet”. And they refuse to pick up your trash if you do not put your trash the way they ask you to. And some days they don’t ever work, then the whole building will be full of trash on the floor.
- You pay extra fee for hot water and other miscellaneous expense monthly.

My bad experiences (could be yours):
- There’s constant noise of the building’s water pump in my bedroom and bathroom. They came and looked at it 3 times but it’s never been fixed. I have to listen to the buzzing noise every single night trying to fall asleep.
- My laundry machine was broken even before I move in, it took the maintenance 3 times to fix it.
- Several electric outlets was not working until now.
- My oven was broken after a month. And every time it gets repaired (4 times), it could only work for once then it would be broken again. I gave up and left it broken till now.
- Last month my fridge door cannot be closed and all food in freezer has gone bad.
- After the fridge door being fixed, the ice maker is broken.

Do not expect Greystar’s 33 Tehama is some kind of “luxury apartment”. It is full of bad services, bad household appliances with unworthy costly expenses.

Good luck looking for your best place to live and avoid Greystar. Cheers！</text>< Pics>

They had terrible services.
We moved out 3 months ago and they haven't sent us the $1500 deposit back. Instead, they sent us another random bill saying it is the final balance while we already paid $10000 as penalty when moving out. Absolutely terrible experience living there.
I would give 0 star if possible.<//Review>

I have mixed feelings about living here. The location is perfect for me. I really like the floorplans and the modern finishings. I love having air conditioning. The rooftop amenities are truly unparalleled, as most others have mentioned.

At the same time, management still has a long way to go, compared to what I have come to expect from similar class of buildings in the area. Several claims made during my tour turned out not to be true. Most importantly, maintenance has really been lacking (3 weeks to fix my lock, 6 weeks to fix my window). Year to date, the building door access system is still having issues about one day a week.< /Text>

It's a perfectly good snack stop for going on a short ride or long ride like we did. Decent selection and there were decent prices and they had various items. Definitely they were better than your average gas station unless it's a big one. But seems like a better place to go to if you don't need gas.</Text>

If you are not hungry I suggest sharing the Pizza between two people. In addition, the environment is cool. You might find college students working on their assignments while eating pizza. The service is pretty fast so at most your will have to wait 10 minutes.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP5V9Ezrmq4TqhSxf9mCu6sYoMfSe7UylUBE8k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOu_Ah9IQk5cJzuRcEDVq0HK8pKs25D5o5uo6Z5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2BF4IEaRE3fOn9JRSd8KT8CaD_alc03B-SEPh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6MPBN4WP5h6T-FO8HRYryXGx9fFN02PqFcA6k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXfzMFpfU_PRnyi5MYu3f55DWp3pYI0SDAtwQs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYSb2DOALH_80v1nUnlQ5qCyxfDhUeuqXPFiWa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c3538e62e13f:0xc62a8de3a37fc696</gmap_id></record>

The "publish your own" pizza lets you make a custom pizza with unlimited toppings for only $8.5. There are a ton of options, and it's really good!<//review>

The prices for the pizza are very reasonable. $8.50 to "Publish your own" which means you can create your pizza with as many toppings you want. The pizza crust is thin and crunchy. Overall the people that work here are very friendly, the service is really great. They serve beer here as well. Topping selection is decent and include several unique items I haven't seen at similar places like rosemary. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I like Blaze better. But definitely a place to visit and try!<//Review>< Pics>

Awesome food.   A great place for lunch, the pizza made just how you want it .
The people in parking lot can't park and will scratch your car , look for a place on the street< /text>

<Review>We were having our car worked on and needed to go some place close for lunch.
This place was great! We got a couple pizza's and two salads everything was very good and the ingredients were fresh! The employees were friendly helpful and polite!
The only thing I didn't like was the salad dressing, I hate dressing out of a bag it's nasty!
My favorite part was the cookie! Amazing! Crispy on the outside soft in the middle! I'm still thinking about that cookie days later! Lol<//Review>< resp>

They even offer a special deal when you show your PCC ID. The pizza is always very good and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I find my self trying new toppings every time I go.

Great pizza place! Large, clean eating area, clean restrooms, and tasty pizzas! They offer"Publish Your Own" Pizzas and Salads, along with a variety of craft beers and yummy desserts (ice cream sandwich!). Parking lot located behind restaurant. It has a great view of Pasadena City College. High chairs and booster seats available.</review>

Spicy red sauce is the way to go, and there are more than enough topping choices. Oh, did I mention 9 dollars!?!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

If I say it's perfect I wouldn't be fair, because five stars and "perfect" aren't enough to describe this place.

Food is awesome, the staff is hipper friendly and welcoming. The theme "vintage news" is nostalgic and exciting.

Love this place! Dont think twice before visiting. It's not "el cheapo" but also not expensive and it's worth every cent.</Text>

Staff was clueless. All the topping lables removed,  which made it difficult to order. Several items missing. O we got that send to me anything thought the poor shape  ice machine was acceptable. Was a jerk when I ask for help walked off to do not much not seen that with my arm in a sling the poor design was very difficult ended up spilling the drink all over my sling. It is a shame when one of your favorite places fails like that especially when you're bringing your people<//text>

You go along the line of ingredients and they put your pizza into a rolling oven. Theres more toppings available after it's been cooked. There's a brief guessing game as to which pizza is yours and then you pay. I went during lunch hour on a Thursday and it was a bit busy; line took about 15 minutes. Other than that, good pizza. I'll definitely be coming back.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c3538e62e13f:0xc62a8de3a37fc696< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>My credit card didn't work for some reason. It felt bad. I called my wife so she can find out why. I was forced to use my debit card in the meantime. While putting in my email address for my receipt the person who waited on me said, "If you are typing in your number it's not a good sign." He was suggesting that I could not pay for my order. I felt like his comment was condescending and racially motivated. I already left a 15% Tip and immediately regretted that decision. The one star was for the food. I went back in because I forgot the cookies I purchased to be stared at by all the white patrons that I didn't realize was behind me. I never felt that way before going to this Pizza Press in Padadena. This person seemed new as I have never seen him before. The entire transaction went well up until that point. Perhaps it isn't what he intended but that's what he made me feel. Don't know if I will go back.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c3538e62e13f:0xc62a8de3a37fc696</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

You can get great pizza at a great price considering that you can put as many toppings as you want on the $8.50 ''publish your own'' pizza. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be slow depending on the experience level of different staff members. They have a lot of beer, but I don't drink beer, do I can't say much about that. The coffee on tap is expensive, but it's really, really strong if that's what you want.< /Text>

< review>
Amazing pizza concept, you make your own personalized pizza with much ingredients as you like. The crew is very nice and friendly. They also have amazing beers and wines.

My recommendation of pizza is:

Pink sauce
Artichokes
Pepperoni
Caramelized onions
Tomatoes
Spinach
Muzzarella Feta
Pesto
Chimi churri
Cilantro
Scallions<//review>

Better of the 'make your own pizza' chains. A tad pricier than the others though, but is more generous with ingredients.< /text>

<Review>Understaffed. Stood and waited with no service for 10 minutes while the single employee cooked pizzas and worked the register. A 2nd employee did come out, but then vanished in the back. Eventually just walked out with no pizza and went to in n out down the street.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) I like the place, the thin crust pizza and the attention. When I go to Pasadena, he stopped by Pizza Press

<text>(Translated by Google) Very delicious freshly baked pizza.
I visited Pasadena for sightseeing.
It can also be taken home, so it is recommended for evening meals.

とても美味しい焼きたてのピザがいただけます。
私は観光でパサディナに訪れました。
持ち帰りもできるので、夜食にもおすすめです。</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c3538e62e13f:0xc62a8de3a37fc696< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Drove two hours to get there and was told I couldn't purchase administration because of a time slot system. Anyone under 18 wasn't allowed to enter after 11am. Not only did this absolutely disappoint me, but entirely changed my opinion of the sport since I had been watching the tempest YouTube videos years prior to going. I was a huge fan of the company and after being denied entry upon arrival I never went back. My interest in freerunning quickly faded after this experience. Luckily there was an amazing rock climbing gym nextdoor and I'm happy to say that four years later I'm still climbing. I strongly recommend anyone thinking about going to tempest to instead find your local climbing gym. Best part is that climbing gyms don't discourage people from trying the sport at a young age.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29b7710b52811:0x1ba1c155ada15e38<//Gmap_id></record>

It's like a playground for grown-ups. There are kid seshes during the day, but Wednesday nights, ladies go get your sweat on! They have a sweet deal (women Wednesdays) to encourage ladies to try out free running. Very friendly staff and friendly people. They have snacks for sale at the location, but there's also places to keep your things if you decide to be frugal and bring your own noms.< /text>

<Text>I wish I could come train here and learn some flips. I’ve always wanted to come but it’s only located in California. I wish tempest made more locations in other states (like Texas :)
Besides that I hope they can make more deals, and a variety of memberships.

Edit: Yes! They did make one right here in Dallas

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I've been going to this parkour gym for many years and can thoroughly say I love every part about it. The facility is one of just a few in southern California that offer walls, obstacles, and bars to practice parkour. Their classes are engaging and help teach you new skills in a safe and driven manner. Their classes aim to help you progress and become more advanced over time, so that you can eventually apply your skills and design your own runs.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1543887881099, 'text': 'Thanks for the generous review, Jacob!

Our makeup policy is in place so that we don't have too many make ups accumulating & people trying to make up classes way too long after the fact, which we hope is fairly reasonable. Not answering the phones is not a good practice though, and we apologize for that. During class hours our staff gets pretty swamped, so if you have to leave a message we'll get back to you as soon as there's a free moment. We really appreciate you signing your daughter up for classes, and we are constantly working to make our process run smoother to avoid future hiccups. I hope you two will be back soon. -Gabe N, Owner"}< /resp>

<Text>Most of the instructors are great there are some that are just going through the motions and seem to not really care. Their office staff sucks and they tell you when you sign up you can make up classes but it must be made up during the billing Cycle. However when you call no one ever answers the phone so you can't schedule a class to make up, by the time you go in for your next class it's too late to make up that class. The second time I tried to make up a class for my daughter I was told you only get one makeup class per month how ridiculous is this when it's summer children get sick things come up people go on vacation and no one ever answers the phone when you call.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

It's wonderful to have a place where everyone is encouraged to try new things and push the limits of their body, and where they can be safe while they experiment. The community here is wonderful, and every time I visit, there are new features to climb on or jump over.< /Text>

Attended a birthday party here and my kid had a great time.  I was glad I want paying for it,  though,  because I found the prices for the classes a bit high.   Kids had a amazing time though.   Be careful when you come,  it's on Nordhoff Place and GPS sent me to Nordhoff.</Review>

<review>Kids and I arrived at 1:05pm today for free play. Previously this was from 1pm to 3pm, but has now changed to from 12 to 2pm. Kids got kicked out at 1:45pm for clean up. When I spoke to the manager, Michelle Monkress, she said that their policy is to only inform people of limited time when they arrive at 1:30pm i.e. so they only get 15 mins of play. She was unwilling to refund any money and had nothing at all to offer in terms of customer support. This was a very disappointing experience. $15 for 40 minutes of play and kids packed in, so not much room to move. I would not recommend it.< /review><Rating>1</Rating><gmap_id>0x80c29b7710b52811:0x1ba1c155ada15e38</gmap_id>< Pics>

Amazing place and great views at the end. The hike is pretty intense, but the view at the end makes it worth it. Overall it's about 10 miles and the last leg is extremely tough, but view from the top makes it worth it!<//text>

You can get to Black Mountain after you reach the "end" of the PGE trail in Rancho San Antonio. It is a difficult hike, do not attempt if you are not used to using 3000 calories on hikes. Especially considering PGE itself may have wiped you out. Spectacular views once you get Black Mountain. TAKE WATER, there is no water on the way.</review>

<Review>Perfect for trail run but parking is horrible. I park a mile away and run from there to avoid the frustration of not getting a parking spot. I actually like that better, because I can add a total of 2 miles on my run. It is a really lovely place to run; we usually run on Woods Trail, Umumhum, Santa Teresa, and Quicksiver. This is one of my of my favorite runs when I can do it :) There are plenty of trails so it's easy to decide if you want a long one or a short one, tough or easy. There are also nice restroom facilities which is a plus as not all Open Space Reserves have restroom facilities. If you haven't checked it out, do it, you won't be disappointed. I gave it a 4 star because of the parking issue...< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>I walked in bought an item that wasn’t in stock but was told it would be there in 4 days at the latest, it’s been over a week they put me on hold for a long time on the phone when I called them and they still couldn’t figure out anything about what I ordered. The customer service is trash the guy on the phone says everything is on back order and the other guy says it’s in the warehouse but can’t find it. I’ve ordered things online that get here faster and in the time they say it will be here. I would recommend taking your business elsewhere<//review>< pictures>

Avoid this place!!! I waited 6 weeks for my camper, which is fine. I got a call saying my camper is in. I made an appointment and took the day off, got kids out of school, drove 2 hours, rented a car, 3 hours AFTER dropping my truck off they called saying the camper don’t fit that basically my camper wasn’t there yet!! Unprofessional bad costumer service!!
I canceled and went with someone else in Ukiah!<//review>

SCAM - BUYER BEWARE - SCAM

I paid for my trailer in full on 8/5 and was promised a trailer on 9/17. It's now 10/13 and the trailer I ordered is here but I'm told that someone else bought it. I was told my trailer was on it way here on 9/25 and 10/1. When I asked for a refund I was told they will mail a check in 6 weeks. I had to call the sheriff to make a report. Chris will lie to your face. Your first warning is when they answer the phone and immediately put you on hold. Horrible service.</Review>

Went to buy a weathergaurd box for my 3500 Chevrolet  pickup, they measured and ordered one then called when it came in, had it installed when they brought it out they installed a box for a compact pickup. When I told him that it was the wrong box he tried telling me that was the one I told him to order,he measured it? Then he told me that he would take it out and to take my business elsewhere?  4th time I've purchased stuff there and everytime there has been a problem of some sort. Never doing business there again!< /Text>

I needed a lumber rack for my truck, so I contacted Truck Tops USA to see if they could assist me. Not only did they have the rack I was looking for in stock, they fit me into their install schedule the same day.

Everyone at the shop was knowledgeable, professional and pleasant. I couldn’t have asked for a better overall experience. I wish I had contacted them sooner.

Thanks, again, guys!< /Text>

<Review>My husband and I went to Truck Tops USA to purchase a trailer to add to our growing business.   Upon arriving my husband was not welcomed at all. The staff actually looked annoyed.  My husband told them he was there to pick up the trailer we had called about.  My husband was rudely told that they didn't have that it stock.  We were very disappointed having driven such along way.  When my husband expressed his frustration the staff was very rude and made us feel extremely uncomfortable.  They definitely didn't want our  business.  Family owned to them means they can talk to you disrespectfully.   I strongly recommend a different company for your trailer needs and I'd stay  away from Truck Tops USA if your looking for friendly quality  service.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808449de7692fba9:0x28880fb2a235b4c<//GmapID></record>

Refused to adhere to the reviews on yelp, walked in the office on 6/15/2019 at 11.10 am with my brother and we got the rudeshed customer service.  Please stop marketing assumption that we should buy the cheapest stuff just because you have to make a sale pitch. Glad I did not buy from this ignorant ‘guy. Chris the guy you were working with this particular morning is driving customer away 😡<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>I have just bought a Mahindra Tractor and the whole experience has been very good.
The prices are very competitive and the sales person gave me additional discount (Chris Patton). Very much appreciated as we were on a tight budget.
Spent the afternoon with Glen who delivered the tractor.
He is such a nice and knowledgeable person - a real pleasure. A very good thing was the safety talk. These things can be dangerous, so treat with respect.
We are very happy with the purchase.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I spoke to a gentleman on the phone named Chris who assured me they had a 5 x 8 dump trailer and they did financing.  After traveling a hour, they told me they can order one and were very rude. Did not bother to show me any of the inventory and he was very argumental on the fact he told me there was a 5 x 8 dump trailer but said and argued that he never told me that. An hour drive for rudeness and laziness.   They both had a hard time getting off their chair.    Never showed me what they did have in stock. The owner/ older guy stood there and let Chris continue with his rudeness.<//review>< Pics>

Its just more of the same. Owner is definitely lacking any customer skills and has a juvenile attitude. They don't stand behind their work unless you press them. After telling you their bad work is somehow your fault, then telling you your an a**h***, and to park your f***ing trailer and they will fix the f***king thing for free..... Well you should get the picture.
Cost me $145 to fix the problem, after 43 miles. I would have spent even more NOT to have to ever see this guy again. Cost them at least one customer.
Chris who helped me buy the trailer was great. If I still had a business, and needed a fantastic salesperson, I would steal him tomorrow. He deserves better.
There are better choices out there, you don't need to deal with such condencending ignorance.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I call about a trailer. The salesman was rude. I called back and the manager followed the salesman  attitude.  About two years ago I purchased a set a racks and I paid for a bar that I still have not received two years later for a center support.  Good luck trying to do business with this company  as I have not had the greatest success .</Review>

<Text>I ordered a camper shell and trusted the employee that assisted me in choosing the one that I wanted..he showed me an are z camper and I decided to have them order it and left a 500 dollar deposit. When I went to have it installed they didn't show me the shell before installing. After more than 2 hours they brought the truck out and it is an entirely different model then he showed me the day I ordered it..it doesn't fit properly and it has molding which was one thing I really specified not wanting..there are gaps and it looks extremely unprofessional..I asked the employees/owner what could be done to fix the issue and he said he wasn't going to do anything and implied that I just wanted him to "eat the camper" and I expressed that I wanted the one the employee pointed out and showed me the first day..he then said that I could buy the most expensive snug top that they can order, which he said is 3000 dollars, and then he would keep the camper that we purchased. All around bad experience..very poor customer service and unprofessional people. Wish I didn't even have to give them one star because they thoroughly don't deserve any..I don't know how they have been in business since 1970..sounds like from other reviews I've read I'm not the only one they've screwed over...I don't recommend them to anyone..</Text><username>Miguel Quintero</username><userid>116161846188114788899<//userid><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Resp>{'time': 1476402684665, 'text': "Hi Renee. I think I spoke with you the day you came in regarding the chip in your shell. We installed your shell about a month before you brought the chip to our attention. Unfortunately the manufacturer will not warranty shells with chips that have left the lot. It would be similar to buying a new truck, and bringing it back to the dealer a month later because of a scratch. Like I told you the day you were her, I will be more than happy to touch up the paint on the chip at no charge. Regarding the shell shifting or a gap in the door, I told you we would adjust the shell, and look into why there is a gap in the door. That offer still stands. If you'd like us to adjust it and touch up the chip, please give us a call or come by."}< /Resp><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>1<//Rating><Time>1474855822191</Time>< Name>

<Review>I drove from a couple hours away back to this place to get a new seal put on my shell, and to replace a brake light that had gone out on the top of it.  I bought my shell from them and thought I'd give them the repeat business.  They charged me over 300$ to put a new seal on, and replace the light.  I got got home and was looking closer at the light and they had broken it in half and just stuck a broken one on there.  I called and told them, and they gave me attitude about it and said they'd send a new one out.  They never did.  Lame.  Here's an idea.... pay or train your employees more so they don't suck.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Very bad experience. Bought a tool box for my truck and paid for the installation. Product came in within reasonable time, but when I came to get my truck, the bad experience started. First, I drive up as the guy who is taller it just brought it out. “How did it go?”  “Well, it’s ok, I guess, I couldn’t get the bed liner to sit straight and I don’t know why, but one leg of the box is shorter than the other, but I managed to get it in.”  Then I looked and the 72” long tool box was mounted with all self tapping screws! Not a single bolt  The tool box is black and had a large scratch on the top. I figured I was overthinking it, went to Friedmans to buy something and saw my same tool box and looked at how it was mounted. They had all bolts. I was going to go back and complain and read the bottom of my receipt. “No returns after installation. Not responsible for any damage to product..etc...(that not verbatim).  VIEW YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE THEY INSTALL! And I guess I should not have drove off. I now, a few months later, have screws that are backing out of the box and it wobbles. So I figured I would write a review and maybe help someone.  Good luck, I hear the other company a block a way is the same owner :-(< /text>

One star rating is way to much for this place! I just want to say this was my worst experience of my life, service sucks its rly rly bad, one of the owners is an 100% lier. One of the owners doesnt know how to treat the costumers, they trying to save a couple dollars to pay an extra employer. When you call in the phone you have to wait so long in hold because they are so unresponsible. If you guys for whatever reason buy somthing from this place make sure you have a paper that proves where your discount is because if not hes not going to respect he is only going to be lying and cry like a baby " no no no"  im not sure if he is racist or he ignored all the costumers</review>

#1. Availability
#1. The Job worked
#1. Price slightly lower than 3 other companies

I had to wait and make sure the Brake controller worked before I posted a review. It was a hardwire job, glad they could get it done. Other places had a wait of 2 weeks or more.< /text>

< review>
This place is a joke. First Chris tried to over charge me and didn't apologize when I called him out. I got a camper shell installed and 10 minutes after leaving the back window popped open on one side while on the highway. I went back to get it fixed and a week later the latch stopped working again. Now the whole camper shell is coming loose and has slid back about 2 inchs on one side.
They don't seem to care much about the installation process after they get paid.
After the over charge attempt and several problems with the installation I won't be recommending this place to anyone.</review>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1476993682858, 'text': "Will - I have to lead with we never tried to over charge you. Firstly I don't recall such a situation AT all, but our POS (Point Of Sale)  would never allow it, and secondly we at this point had already agreed on pricing and both have a copy of the invoice. So please don't make false claims like that on the internet.\n\nSecondly, when you came back because of the latch adjustment on the camper shell, which we do test before you leave the store (some times they need adjustment, like any product) we can not simulate driving down the road (IE: vibrations, bumps, etc.). I immediately dropped everything I was doing to make sure your truck was taken care of (all the while your'e cussing in my ear about how it's a piece of s*it etc.), all it was is a simple adjustment. We adjusted it immediately for you.\n\nWe actually care greatly about customer service, and the installation process. I have thousands of customers that will tell you that. What we don't care greatly about is being talked down to like you did to us, that's when the experience turned poor, but I digress.\n\nI still care so greatly about your installation and experience, if you are having any issues with the camper, bring it in so we can correct it. That's why products have warranties, and that's why we give a year warranty on all of our labor."}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>So Fresh, So Tasty! Our first time here to buy some donuts, service was friendly and fast. We picked out a bear claw, apple fritter, chocolate twist, chocolate old fashion, glazed old fashion and chocolate milk bar. All for only $10! And she tossed in a few donut holes and another donut. Very nice! Try it, you'll like it.<//review>< Pictures>

Don't order bacon from there it's not even heat it up they give it to you cold. And they don't give you the exact pieces they're supposed to give you very very bad customer service</Review>< Pics>

I understand things happen but an, "Im sorry for the wait." makes some kind of difference after a minimum 10 minute wait with no explanation, just radio silence, at the menu. My oder was correct, food was good, but service left much to be desired.<//Review>< Pics>

The crew is VERY polite, and they do their best.

I've been asked to pull over in drive thru once, and I had to go inside to ask about my order. Turns out they forgot about it, so I just asked for a refund.

Today I ordered the popcorn chicken with curly fries. It wasn't bad, but KFC does it better. I'd only order it again for the spicy chicken.

I didn't eat the curly fries because they were stale. Which was a bummer, the curly fries are usually always good, but these had the taste and texture of fries that were left out and then reheated 🤢 I even separated them from the chicken they were so gross

I still like Jack in the Box, but I definitely have to think about coming back to this one.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Horrendous late night service, probably the worst I've ever seen from a fast food place. If i could give 0 starts i would. Either they are horrifyingly understaffed or the employees aren't qualified to work there. Over 1 hour total in line, and nearly 15 minutes before my order was taken at the mic (ONLY ONE CAR WAS AHEAD OF ME). Pretty sure the employees are purposely stalling so that people leave the line out of frustration. I would avoid this place like the plague past 10 pm or so.<//Text>< Pics>

Slower than any jack in the box I've ever been to. There was literally only two cars in front of me and it took them 20 min to get them through.<//review>

<review>We come to this location because is close to our home but to be for a fast food it is not fast !

Their overnight crew is just lazy, I was in line for 30 min+ at 3 am after a long road trip, get to the microphone to order and they say because they have a line they’re closing for an hour, I’ve worked fast food when it’s busy it’s not that hard just lazy workers</text>

I placed my order. Went to the window at drive thru. Was paying with EBT.
I was told there EBT machine was broke.
Then she said: "dinner room", and turned away. I asked her: "what you mean" ?
She would only say: "dinning room".
Finally after saying several times: "what do you mean" ?
She informed me, that the only working EBT machine is in the dining room. Then she pointed at it. Five feet away. I asked her if she could just take the card and use that machine ? She would only say: "dinning room". I explained I have disability tags on my car. I go through the drive thru because it can get very painful and difficult to walk. She said: "dinning room, thank you" and walked away.
I drove off.</Text>

<Review>After going to Horseshoe Bend for the sunset, we didn't have many options for supper. We had ate at a Jack in the Box several years ago on vacation, so we gave it a try. Since we were tired, we went through the drive through. The employee who took our order was very friendly and knew Exactly what he was doing. At the window, he was even more friendly. Our order was hot, fresh and just the way we ordered it. On our last day in Page, we decided to grab breakfast on the road while traveling to the North Rim of Grand Canyon. So; we ended up back at Jack in the Box... Lets just say, I think the breakfast may have been better than the burgers! Any they have one pretty good burger!! For fast food, this joint has it going on! I wish we had one back in Tennessee.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dc6e2bdf2c648f:0x904c06bcc43d8246< /gmapID>< rating>

Wow just wow! So very disappointed and had to throw away $25 worth of the worst fast food I ever had. Everything I ordered was cold and drenched in mayonnaise. Lettuce was yellow and tomatoes were soggy and warm. I will NEVER go back. Jack in the box used to be my favorite and never had an issue until today< /review>

<text>They didnt take my order at the drive thru, we wait for around 5 mins. No one talk to us to take our order, we pull forward and when we get to the window the cashier was trying to charge us. We explain that they didnt take our order, insted of taking our order she:said do you want to go around amd try again? Really!? Its always something on this location. Manager please train your staff better, poor girl was so confused 🤦‍♂️<//text>< Name>

The cashier early  today at the ( Oceansie branch)   was very good with her job. She greets customers  with smile' she is courteous and respectful and most of all communicates with customers about their needs. I don't mind serving food late because she made sure it is bring attended to. Bathroom is well kept  by this guy who is very hard working,  courteous and attentive. Well trained staff.. for preparers are a little slow.<//Text>

<review>the white cheddar bacon did not meet my expectations according to the ads
I give it a D , when it should have been an A  ,The  fries were abundant for an A , and drink was OK. I expected more from JIB marketing on this burger  , but it was a letdown .

Update :
This is to let you know I went back to this location today on 1/20 to give it another try , and give you the benefit of the doubt . i ordered 4 tacos , and a jr. bacon cheeseburger - which was fair .  when it comes to cheeseburgers , i would prefer the old style cheeseburger with the secret sauce instead on the value menu . the four tacos were so over sauced up , they were sloppy and the top of the bag was a stained mess when it was handed to me . they were too hot from all the hot sauce , to enjoy . I'm now taking another star off the rating now because of it . please don't bother to reply . this location and the one down in the valley , need to have someone from upper management run through their drive thrus as secret customers  every couple of weeks to keep the quality up .</review><user_id>113235013435654620692<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

I don't usually eat fast food. But once in awhile I get a hankering for a little bit this was the first time I used the drive-thru at this Jack in the Box. It was quick and easy and my food was served hot to go. Girl at the checkout counter was quite friendly and all was good.< /Text>

One of the only true 24 hour (Open Indoor with drive thru), in North San Diego County. Sometimes gets a little crazy at local bar closing times but worth it. Good, thorough and helpful staff that go the extra mile!< /Text>

It's your basic Jack in the Box.  The food is decent for the price.  I love their dining room fountain machine which allows you to mix and match Coke products.  The premises are clean, as are the bathrooms.<//Text>

If for nothing else, the diversity of the menu and the ability to have breakfast menu options at any time of the day, has to keep Jack at the top of the Fast Food Mountain Top. Because their HQ is here in San Diego,  I am told we are the first to get to try new menu offerings before the rest of the nation. In the end it's fast food, not fine dining.
Where else can you go and have a breakfast sandwich,  an egg roll, double cheese burger, and pancakes, at 4am, ordered at a drive thru?</Review>

Ridiculously unflavorful sourdough jack. Everything was cold and bland, minus the fries. The fries were tasty, warm, and crisp.</Text>

The staff was super friendly and good customer service but unfortunately the food itself was sub-par. Mostly they over cooked ( barely not burnt) my jalapeno poppers 😭< /Review>

We stood there for 10 minutes waiting to be rung up while workers walked right past up and didn't acknowledge us. It's jack in the box so I don't exactly expext amazing service but I at least expect better service than I received.< /Review>

<rating>2< /rating><pics>None</pics><Text>Warning! Deceptive practices. I ordered a #30 combo. Pancakes, eggs, sausage OR 1 slce of bacon, hash patty AND it comes with a drink OF YOUR CHOICE. Menu board read $5.29(+tax) The girl when taking my order tells me I can have both sausage AND bacon. I ask how much more is the cost "only pennies difference" so I agree.  I ask for orange juice, "oh slight upcharge for that". Then she says "homefries or extra pancakes come with that meal, which would you like?" Never have had their home fries, I choose that. When I go up to pay my bill (I am in the drive thru) my bill is $7.96! A difference of $2.10 (not including tax). I get to my office and realize I did not get the bacon and the home fries which they charged me 70 cents for is only a large tablespoon full in a side container. I called and asked to speak to a Manager. There isn't one. I'm told to come back "whenever" and they will give me my food. How did we go from $5.29 to $7.96?  The words "it comes with" means included in price but at Jack In the Box it means hit you up for more money..  "Your choice of" means, no extra charge, pick what you want. Apparently, anything other than water, coffee or coke will cost you extra. It isn't the $2.10 difference that irks me, it's the deceptive practice of how they imply it's all included. For $8.00 I can sit down at Denny's and have my meal cooked fresh. No hidden charges.
Legal battles for Jack on the future. Karma comes at a cost.</Text></record>

What happened to south west salad? That was the best dish you had on the menu.
I tried the new buttery burger it's alright but needs more vegetables on it.</Review>

<Review>was supposed to be open 24 hours so I walked all the way out there. there was a handwritten sign on the door CLOSED FOR CLEANING but the floors remained dirty and nobody so much as looked at a broom. at least 6 potential customers got tired of waiting and left, as I did eventually.< /Review>< response>

<Text>I love the Oreo cookie shakes and visit Jack in the Box at least once a week to splurge on my calorie intake and treat myself to 1. The last time I was there a elderly man was ahead of me in line and when he got to the register to order he would not stop talking the cashiers ear off about everything but food. He literally would not order and would not move. For the first I kid you not 10 minutes the worker was pleasant and pretended to be interested in his one sided conversation probably because this guy seemed so lonely but as the line grew and grew the cashier finally had no choice but to turn and walk away while the man was still talking just to get him 2 get out of the way. The manager then came up and was able to quickly and efficiently take the man's order and move him aside. I was next so the manager motion for me to come up and he asked me how long I had been waiting. I told him a long time and he gave me my shake for free! After that of course I was not upset and was very happy about the way the situation was handled. Kudos to Jack In The Box and their choice of employees! I will continue to visit once a week or more depending on the success of my diet or lack thereof 😁< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

The food was great don't get me wrong. But nearly everytime I come, they mess up my order. Also, when I added more to my order, this lady with a W in front of her name (her tag was all scratched up) was complaining to the cashier for not telling her earlier what I had ordered additionally. Even though I added it on.<//Review>
