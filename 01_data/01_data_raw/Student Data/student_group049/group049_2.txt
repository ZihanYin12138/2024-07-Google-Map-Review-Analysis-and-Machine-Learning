Still looking for an honest automotive shop. Over all, I wouldn't recommend this store. Angel was the writer I talked to (who was nice, buddy buddy like). I explained what my car was doing and he gave me his thoughts. I told him what I thought it was based upon previous service by another dealer and myself. After leaving it at the shop, he called me a day or two later and gave me a whopping $1,900 estimate. He guaranteed me this should fix my issue. As upset with the ticket amount, I didn't listen as closely as I should have to everything they where doing to the car...just sold/blinded on the fact they found my issue and was going to fix it. Turns out, I got a water pump and hose that was leaking, trans service that I didn't need, an oil change I didn't request and they changed my engine and trans mounts that I DID need. They said my water pump was leaking and when I mentioned that was my oil leak, they said it was the water pump. Funny...I've never needed to fill my coolant. Angel was nice, but he's responsible for his mechanics honesty. Tho my shifting issues seemed less noticeable with new mounts, my problem reappeared by the time I got straight home from their shop. I called Angel and informed him immediately. He said he'd make it right. After waiting, I called corporate to see if I could get a second opinion at a different store, instead they sent me to the owner of this shop, Larry. He was nice, wanted to make it better and briefly tried to fix one of many oil leaks they said I didn't have, which didn't make a difference of course. They said they would call me in a couple months to straighten out the rest of  the work, but never heard back. Their shop is IMMACULATE (and impressed me), but they are not careful with your car. They splashed coolant on both sides of my fenders and a small nick of paint off one of them (see lower left in pic). I don't wish to return, I'll be taking all FIVE of my cars somewhere else. I would recommend you going elsewhere and get another opinion.< /review>

Angel reported the progress of their investigation to her each day until a determination could be made with confidence. I found him to be professional and courteous throughout the process.
Our family has taken other vehicles there for transmission work in the years past. They are over 25 miles from our home but we will always refuse to take any future transmission work needs anywhere else - regardless how close to our home they would be.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Brought my truck in that was in immaculate condition. They ran my truck into a steel rack and put a huge, deep gash in the tire. When I went to pick it up they told me, "You should get that tire replaced." I said it was them who did that and they said they would speak with the "driver" the next day and get back to me. NEVER HEARD FROM THEM. They have ZERO respect for the property of others and I now have to replace the tire on top of finding someone else to complete the work they refused to even diagnose. I have used these guys a few times over the years but will NEVER AGAIN.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<username>Robert Roach<//username><Date>1610741341780< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>AAMCO in Redlands was referred to me by a friend, so I took my 1990 Bounder to them for a diagnosis! First I called and spoke to Angel who is the Manger I believe. I already had a quote from another location and basically knew I was unfortunately in need of a new transmission. The only thing pending was how much for repair and internal damage. Keep in mind I have never been to AAMCO before, nor do I know Angel. First of all Angel explained the entire process to me from the free diagnostics, to labor and examination of internal damages. Angel was very professional and what I like and noticed if I unintentionally interrupted him he stopped and aloud me to express myself regarding the situation. And then Angel would explain and answer all my questions. I really am skeptical a lot of times regarding businesses being honest and upfront. I had only changed my transmission fluid prior to the transmission sudden appearing not to function properly, so I kind of felt I was being scammed by these transmission repair shops. Anyhow, I drove my motorhome to AAMCO in Redlands and found Angel very professional and immediate service not having to wait was another plus in addition to Angels professionalism! I found the business itself extremely clean and organized which is a plus to me. Ultimately within a handful of days transmission was repaired along with some pricing and warranty negotiations and the job was complete. I initially had questions why my transmission went out like that all along thinking my transmission was fine. Angel had the transmission technician come out and explain everything to me as it was obvious the technician was old school and extremely knowledgeable about transmissions. They also pointed out a leak in cooling system for repairs. The technician was also very friendly and professional! So, now I’m driving home and discover that my motorhome is operating extremely well! I guess I was accustom to the old transmission thinking it was functioning properly! But, boy was I wrong! It shifted fantastic and climbed up the 10 freeway into Yucaipa with no problem and was shifting perfectly! I’m so glad I went to AAMCO and highly recommend them to anyone! May the Lord bless you all during this 2021 year and let’s make it a great year!!!!<//Review>< pictures>

AAMCO Transmissions & Total Car Care in Redlands is a five star operation. The technicians and management at this location demonstrated such expertise, professionalism, and prompt service. I am a female who knows nothing about cars and was rather leery of mechanics, as some do not always have the best of reputations. Happy to report that when I had my Honda Accord 2005 towed there, I was greeted by Mike the manager and was immediately assisted and put at ease, which I instantly knew that I was indeed at the right place and in good hands. Mike went the extra mile for me and thanks to him and this establishment, I have my independence again and a new found faith in the industry, due in part to the ethical and transparent way I was treated by Mike. I would highly recommend this location and establishment to anyone, especially the female population who may be feeling apprehensive  because you will be treated fairly.</Text>

He was professional and helpful with my all ny questions. What really stood out to me was how honest he was, I was originally quoted at $249.99 for a Transmission flush over the phone. Within a few minutes he explained that due to my transmission not having a cap or something related to that they are only going to charge me $219. He could of kept the original price and I would have not even noticed, especially since many companies are taking losses with this pandemic currently. I think that speaks volumes about integrity and overall honesty. Definitely would recommend just based on that</Review>< Pictures>

I came in for a transmission service and found that a rebuilt transmission is what was needed.  Even though I chose not to have the rebuild, I would 100% recommend AAMCO Redlands.  Mikes customer service ethic is off the charts !! He made my husband and I feel very at ease. He was up front and honest about what was needed , and also finding out the they are full service for all automotive needs I will definitely be recommending and using their service in the future.< /review>

I have used several auto shops in town, but none of them compare with the service, treatment and professionalism that you get at AAMCO of Redlands.  Mike was very knowledgeable, honest, ethical and well mannered.  The person who referred me to him said: "Elsa, if there is a auto shop where you can get the best service and you will not be taken advantage of, it is at AAMCO of Redlands. Talk to Mike." Now I can attest to that, too. Thank you, Mike.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Everyone here is very rude angel also saying his the manager when his not . And then you have Larry the owner very rude. They charged my mother in law for a diagnostic that was never approved they charged her 200.00, so I called and told them that wasn't right to charge her for something she didn't approve of. And then the owner Larry told me to shut up and that I didn't know anything. So don't trust this place for your cars.

If you’re looking for the best customer service and honest employees who care, this place is it. Mike was truly helpful, straight forward and kind. Mike explained everything each step of the way and went above and beyond to help me get into my car quickly. Mike and Larry set it up to open the store so I could get my car in a day they were closed. I truly appreciate their service and helping me out when I really needed it. It was stressful having my transmission go out, but these guys helped me feel at ease and got the job done quickly. I highly recommend this place if you need any job done.< /text>

This place is great! Mike provided excellent customer service and made me feel very at ease about leaving my car with them, which is not something I normally feel comfortable with since I am very picky about who works on my car. I have extremely high standards and they met every single one of them. It is so difficult to find an honest, polite mechanic so I’m incredibly grateful for finding this place and meeting Mike. I would absolutely recommend them.< /review>

This place is a complete rip off!!  Do not come to this place.  Picked up my car a couple weeks late since I was out of town. They charged me an extra 900 dollars just to get the car back. I get the car back and it’s in worse shape than when I brought it in!!< /Text>

< Review>
My transmission took a dump a few weeks ago.  I knew it was going to be expensive, but I needed to get it fixed.  Unfortunately, it was on a weekend so I had to wait until Monday.  I had my car towed in first thing on Monday morning.  Mike was professional and approachable.  He gave me a likely road map for how the process would proceed.  They had to rebuild my transmission.  The work was completed by Friday and the repair cost was at the bottom end of his ballpark estimate.  I can back two weeks later for inspection and my car was operating within normal parameters.  They will definitely have my business if I need another transmission.< /Review>

I took my vehicle in to service a check engine light issue. I brought it to AAMCO redlands because I hoped the issue fell under my extended warranty and AAMCO is an approved shop under my warranty company, but Sadly it wasn't covered. What pleased me was Mike, with AAMCO, explained that would likely be the case before hand so we were well prepared to incur the cost since he was familair with our warranty company. Aside from that, he gave us insight to the issue prior to racking up a bill and after the diagnostic it ended up being a less than $400 repair including diagnostic, parts and labor. He even worked with us on the diagnostic fee because one, we thought we would be covered by the warranty and two, he showed compassion towards our potentential set back from the current global pandemic. He completed the work so fast but kept the car overnight for us because it was more convenient for us to pick it up the next day. Overall our experience was friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, honest and we felt very well cared for. I highly recommend AMMCO Redlands. Im so glad I found this gem of a shop to take my cars where I know there is integrity and honesty and the job will get done right. Thanks again, Mike!!!< /Review>

I took my Durango to Mike at AAMCO after Redlands Dodge failed to address the problem in a timely manner.  Dodge made me wait one week for an appt, and when I finally dropped it with them, they said it would take another week just to give me a diagnosis.  Instead I took it to Mike, who diagnosed and fixed the problem in only 2.5 days.  Mike was very attentive, and called me a couple times each day to let me know the progress.  I rented a car at Enterprise during the time my Durango was being worked on; even the guys over there knew Mike and told me my car could not be in better hands than with him.  I picked up my Durango last night and it runs great!  I'll refer anyone to Mike at AAMCO, he's honest, kind, and extremely hardworking.  Thank you so much!<//Text>

I have come to Aamco a few times and it has been nothing short of amazing each time! They have fantastic customer service with a speedy repair service to match. Larry & his team are very friendly, professional & informative. Each time I’ve come in with my car, they immediately got down to the root of the issue & got me in and out as quickly as possible. I would highly recommend Aamco to anyone.<//Text>

I had a problem with a grinding noise coming from the driveline of my prerunner truck, and the AAMCO mechanics in Redlands CA were able to pinpoint the exact problem and confirm that it wasn’t a transmission problem, but in fact an alignment problem in the driveline and worn out motor mounts (Due to full sendage from offroading). Huge thanks to Mike at AAMCO in Redlands CA!!!</review>

<Text>Went in for transmission fluid change.  The manager Manny was really helpful and honest with me. It seems that my vehicle can only be serviced by the dealer. What I really appreciate is the honesty and a No BS explanation from Manny.
Unfortunately I have to take it to dealer to have the service performed. I highly suggest others to go to AAMCO for your service.
Thanks to Manny and staff. 👍</Text><time>1532199595298<//time>< Name>

<Text>Will not even give you a price for a transmission replacement regardless of whether that is your wish or not.  Only want to sell you on the "free diagnostic" and offer a pathetic 24k warranty on a replacement (should it be deemed necessary by their specialized diagnostic).  Not forthcoming and I would not trust these guys with my vehicle.  If they can't give you a price for a straight forward transmission replacement they are going to try and rip you off.  Stay away!<//Text>< response>

We went to get a new radiator, after the repairs were made we drove off parked our car. Well next day as we drove it , our car overheated!!!!! We called them to let them know what happened, we reserved a simple response of ( oh don't blame us)!!! Come to find out the fan was not connected which caused our car to overheat. Thanks to this mistake it cost us $2 thousand dollars in repairs. I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE FOR ANY SERVICES OR RECOMMEND IT.< /text>

I originally gave this place a good review when my transmission was repaired but car had now broke down twice for the same transmission issue. Every time I was given a date for the repairs on my car to be finished the completion date was pushed back a few more days. The manager has shown no respect for my time or the money spent on the repairs.<//Review>

<text>Ask for Manny, this guy goes above and beyond for you. He was helpful right from the get go. It took a bit longer for the diagnostics to get done than expected, but he gave me a significant discount on labor because of the delay. He came by the shop on Sunday (supposed to be closed) just so I could pick up my car. Felt very taken care of. Will be bringing my car here for any other repairs in the future.< /text>< pictures>

Went in there a few months ago for a transmission problem on my truck when it wouldn't shift out of 1st gear.. Took it to another place for an inspection and the quoted me over $1500. Brought it here for a 2nd opinion and Larry told me it was just a sensor that had caused the problem. $300 and I was back on the road. Thank Larry!<//Review>

Beware Andy from Victorville AAmco trying post as me in prior post with my name misspelled  like you did on my wifes paperwork Chaidez is correct spelling, the words used were verbatim as you put on our paperwork. Cant wait to show Corporate when i report you! My experience with Mike at Redlands was very proffessional and how Customer Service should be. Andy at Victorville AAmco shame on you, the lengths of your FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR, UNETHICAL PRACTICES, know no bound. BTW its "Jerry Rigged" not jury rigged, learn to spell before posting.</Text>

My wife and I travel a lot and we search out the best to work on our van. We had our transmission rebuilt like new by Aamco in Redlands Ca. This is after going to 4 different shops and asking question about our van. These are the only people who could answer my questions we had the work done and are very happy.< /Text>

<review>I got my transmission rebuilt at this AAMCO in 2012 for $4,272.49. For that price, the only warranty I was given was for 24 months or 24,000 miles. I have recently learned that most places will give you a 100K mile warranty for their transmission. Also, most places will charge $1,500 to 2,500 dollars. I feel like I was not treated fairly by this AAMCO. It is now 2015 and my transmission needs to be rebuilt again only after 30,000 miles of usage. For the price I paid, I do not believe that should already be breaking down. Mechanics I have spoken to have told me that this usually means that the build was not done will or there was a mistake made. Please consider all your options and make sure you do your proper price checking before having this AAMCO work on your car, they will overcharge you and the transmission may not last in the long term.</review>< user>

I had my transmission replaced on my F250 sometime back and, as it was a farm truck I hardly used, it did not rack up many miles.  When the transmission experienced problems, I took it back to AAMCO.  Although it took a few times to get the problem with the transmission resolved, Larry’s crew figured it out and now my truck runs great.  I have waited several months before writing this review to make sure there are no issues.  All is well.<//Text>

<Text>I called, talked to Manny, feared I had a catastrophic transmission failure in my 2015 Honda Civic. He offered a free diagnostic, I said, I can't afford $4000 for a new transmission, so could I pay for the diagnostic? He said "Hold on to your money, this could be something minor". I had put 3 quarts of fluid in the previous weekend, I doubted it was minor. They treated me very well. When he called, I couldn't believe they found a loose sensor, topped the fluid, test drove the car,  and decided not to charge me. Customer here for life.

My review starts with the phone call I Made prior to going to the shop. I spoke with Mike and explained to him my situation and he came at me with follow up questions which is something a good technician should ALWAYS do while on the phone with a customer. It helps establish a relationship with the customer while simultaneously gathering additional information about the main concern. Then instead of just trying to get me into the shop he offered to give me a call back with an over the phone quote for parts and labor for what the problem sounded like. He called me back with a very fair estimate and even offered the services of a company they use for customer credit. Then offered for me to bring my vehicle in for a FREE DIAGNOSIS.
I limped my vehicle into the shop and was greeted by Al. He was very friendly and professional. He took down my information while Mike finished with another customer. When I met Mike he was just as he was over the phone sympathetic of my situation and very professional. He assured me that his technician would find the problem and I would know shortly what it was. The technician Bill took it for a test drive and came back shortly. Mike addressed me to the counter and let me know that my clutch simply needed an adjustment and then told me that it was done and that there was no charge. Now let me tell you they could have easily sold me at minimum a 500 dollar service for which I was previously quoted but they didnt. The remained honest and helped me out. That's what builds customers for life Mike stated. Well said sir. I can promise you that nobody will be touching my car before Mike and the good people of AAMCO of Redlands.<//text>< Pictures>

Took my handicap van in for transmission issue. Turned out to be a broken relay and there are not sold individually for replacement.  It would cost me $1500 to replace the entire compartment. Manny ay aamco went out of his way and was able to find a used relay and fixed my van free of charge! Aamco is a great, honest business and will now be taking my vehicles here!<//review>

Aamco in Redlands has been servicing my family's vehicles for over 10 years now. They have done everything from transmission rebuilds to general preventative maintenance on our vehicles - and every experience has been great!

FRIENDLY
Whether it's been a scheduled visit or an emergency drop-off, the entire crew at Aamco is extremely accommodating.

KNOWLEDGEABLE
Every visit or phonecall entails speaking to a courteous and knowledgeable person who can actually explain things, unlike many other shops where the staff merely just read a script off their computer screen without actually knowing anything about what they're "explaining" to you.

HONEST
Most important of all, Aamco of Redlands is honest and transparent! They won't try to sell you parts or service that you don't need and they certainly don't charge you an arm and a leg like most other places.

Aamco in Redlands is a genuine, friendly, knowledgeable, honest company where I am comfortable sending everyone I know. Give them a shot for all of your vehicle needs - you will not be disappointed.< /text>< rating>

Horrible horrible place!!  Please do not bring your car here. I brought my car here to get a wire fixs from underneath my car. 2 days later they finally call and let me know what's going on with my car. I picked my car up and brought it to another auto shop just to see all kinds of electrical tape holding up the part I needed fixed. Don't bring your car here I have been spreading the word by mouth. GO SOMEWHERE ELES!!!!!<//Review>

<Review>THIS IS A ZERO STAR RATING!! IF I GIVE A 1 STAR IT WOULD GET KICKED BACK!!!DO NOT GO TO the AAMCO DEALER IN REDLANDS CA TO HAVE YOUR TRANSMISSION REPAIRED!!. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!!! I had my transmission rebuilt 3 TIMES and none of them worked. when the transmission was acting up again for the 4th time I took my car somewhere else and a part inside the transmission broke and there was metal debris in the transmission oil so another rebuild was performed in another place and now it's working fine. IF YOU TAKE YOUR CAR TO AAMCO YOU WILL BE MAKING A VERY BIG MISTAKE!! I would give zero stars if I could!!!!!!<//Review>< Date>

Horrible service, they lie about what needs to be done.  They claim they fix something but car breaks down again. They claim a second time it's fixed it breaks down again.  Took it back a third time and the said the part they replaced the second time was installed wrong.  They are clueless.  Stay away!!!!!</text>

So far so good. I got my vehicle diagnosed and pretty much told me what i already knew (im a mechanic) i had replace some parts for the fault that it was throwing. And the fault came back. I dont have all the equipment or time to rebuild a transmission at home. And i didnt want to order a rebuilt trans online (too much of a hassle). So they tore it down. Showed why and how it failed. Said ok to the rebuild and i had my car back. 5 days of repairs/ordering parts. Drove the car home noticed a minor leak. Took it back to them and found a loose breather hose. Nobody is perfect like i said im a mechanic. I understand. Great service and i would go back (for major stuff i cant do)</review>

I needed to register a vehicle purchased out of state and the team at Alia was able to process the vin verification, registration cost differential (including taxes), and provide plates and stickers in under 30 min. Their digital forms make the process extremely quick and easy as well. Fantastic service and would highly recommend these guys anytime to avoid the DMV and work with someone friendly who understands "DMV speak." No back and forth to counters with multiple different forms filled out to different levels, no line, no wait, no worries!<//Text>

This is the worst place I had a really bad experience. They Lied to me and charge me more fees that I don’t have to pay them when I found out he start tilling me this is what comes up on DMV . I don’t know my fees were just $80. So I recommend everyone call so many other offices and compare prices I never visit this place.< /review>

<Text>Called to get a quote for auto insurance and guy wanted to argue with me about me inquiring about full coverage on an older car when I currently have full coverage and have had it on this vehicle for over a year and hung up on me when i tried to explain to him it's me getting the insurance. Horrible company 👎</Text>< pics>

If you’re looking for quick and easy service, this the right place for you. You can even call ahead to ensure that you don’t have to go to the DMV if you’re uncertain. Also a great place to request an auto insurance. Kind of a one stop shop really.< /review>

<text>HORRIBLE. I called and wanted to get full coverage on a new motorycle i was getting but i told him i wanted to do it over the phone (becuase obviously i cant take the bike off the lot without insurance) he told me not to boss him around that he doesnt work for me, very sternly, i was literally in shock. Never have i ever had anyone, and business person, talk to me like that. NOT PROFESSIONAL< /text>< Time>

THE WORST CUSTOMERS SERVICE EVER!!!
They are supper rude and they are con artists they "Kamal" told me that my insurance with GEICO is going to be around 2k for 6 months and when I got a quote form geicos website it was wayy less. I recommend that you get your quote from the insurance dealers website rather then here THEY ARE THIEFS PERIOD.<//text>

My experience with this agency is plain shameful. No respect what so ever. and i hate to say that, but be careful because the broker working there might go crazy on you thinking you just insulted him or talked to him in a bad way although none was said, AT ALL, so expect to be insulted & screamed at from a maniac for no freaking reason. NONE.
He has auditory hallucination 5/5, and probably on drugs.
RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, and you won't lose a dime, you are the winner trust me.
NO respect, decency, etiquette, or basic human moralities. ZERO.< /Text>

I rented a car to drive for Uber & Lyft through Jack Asman of San Diego Rent-A-Car. He had me sign this insurance agreement that did not even list the company’s name, but I trusted him since he rents to many other Uber & Lyft drivers. I moved to Los Angeles, & the car was returned to San Diego a week ago. I was charged on Friday for the insurance company, contacted my bank, because this put me in the hole in my bank account. The bank informed me that it was through Kemper Insurance. I contacted Kemper telling them that I did not have the rental car any longer. Kemper informed me that they do not insure people who rent cars, only people who own them. It turns out, the agreement that Jack Asman had me sign, through Alias Insurance, & with Kemper Insurance, was not within Kemper’s guidelines. I am waiting for my lawyer to call me back. I want my money returned to me. This should NEVER have been issued to me!<//text>

If you are looking into moving I would consider looking into Jia Apartments. My husband and I moved here post-covid and I have to say that I am truly happy to have found Jia Apartments. The management team here is great, the General Manager David and his team always replies so quickly to our inquiries. Plus everything is online, from requesting service to sharing comments to our Jia community. Jessie is one of the security guys here and he is so friendly and makes you feel like this place is a safer place with him being here. Also, not to mention the repair team is always on top, Carlos is part of the repair team and if something breaks he comes in and handles it all!! I love this place and the area is so cool, lots of place to eat and walk.</Text>

Service here is incredible! Love Carlos and John and Eric! I put in a request today and Carlos showed up a few hours later and quickly fixed our problem and when I asked him about something else - he was quick to find a solution. They are a great team - so efficient and great service.< /Review>

< Review>
I've lived at Jia for almost two years now and have had nothing short of a wonderful experience all around. The entire staff has been extremely friendly and helpful no matter what department or area of service they are tasked with. They all know my dog Peanut and are always willing to take time to give her some attention (she just has to stop by the office every single day to see Elisia and May).

Even with the pandemic guidelines causing the amenities to shut down, it was still enjoyable as the residents are nice and look out for one another. There was a sense of community as everyone just hunkered down and were respectful of each others' own work from home challenges. If you're a dog owner, you'll find a number of them here as well as it is very dog-friendly!</Review>

Excellent place to live. In relation to similar places in the area, I prefer Jia as there is not that much foot traffic in Chinatown so it's a much more relaxing place to call home. Downtown and Little Tokyo is very accessible if you're looking for more restaurants and bars though this comes with more traffic and encounters with homeless people. They were very cautious with COVID precautions which I appreciate and from signing the lease to daily living, they have been nothing but professional. You may hear some people complain about the fact that the package pick up room needs additional surveillance, which I agree with. Also, there are sometimes issues with the dog park, but there are also ample spaces around the building for your dog to do its business. To me, these are minor issues compared to the safety and responsiveness that they provide. In terms of fairness in pricing, I think they are competitive. Every complex comes with additional fees but they were very transparent when I asked directly. Would highly recommend.< /Text>

Jia apartments have the best maintenance  services. During the memorial weekend our washer stopped working. Carlos found that motor was not working. Carlos replaced the motor and it is working well. So nice to have people at Jia like Carlos to resolve our problem in an efficient and perfect result. Thank you Carlos.<//Text>

Jia is a gem in the busy city of LA. It’s clean, quiet, and has plenty of amenities that I thought were impossible to find in one place for a reasonable amount. One of the key features for me is the amount of space. The studios are pretty spacious if you’re trying to decide between a studio and 1 bedroom, and the 1 bedroom is great if you have a lot of stuff or enjoy hosting. The staff is attentive, friendly and available. The manager David makes sure we’re aware of any issues in advance (such as how the Chinese New Year festivities affect parking, road closures, etc) and the maintenance team works around the clock. Another wonderful feature is parking. I don’t have to fight for a parking space and my guests don’t have to worry about parking either. So, if you’re debating whether you’d like to live here, let the office take you on a tour!<//text>

JIA is an amazing apartment community. It is near perfect, literally. Elisia in the leasing office is one of the sweetest people I have ever met, she literally sold us on the unit that we selected. She made everything easy and provided us with all of the information needed.  I moved from Chicago, so finding the best place that was relatively affordable was key. THIS WAS IT! I have only been here a week and all the staff is efficient and nice. I love it here. I say give this place a shot!< /Text>

Beautiful Apartments! Friendly , amazing, professional staff. The move in was super easy and every day I fall in love with my apartment more and more from the golden dragons 🐉  to the views on Broadway. There is a freaking Starbucks located inside of the building. Plus walking distance to all the best restaurants in China town! I have friends all over LA however, they love staying at my place. Highly recommend this property.< /Review>

<Review>I lived at Jia apartments for 1.5 years and absolutely loved my time there. The apartments are spacious, modern decor and amenities. The rent is really well priced for the amount of space that you get. They have a lot of parking for guests and it's great to have a Starbucks in the apartment complex.

The community manager David is the most amazing person! He's super friendly and we've spent many a moment's talking about Marvel Cinematic Universe. Michael from the leasing team was absolutely amazing with the lease renewals and they worked with me on the price. John from the apartment maintenance crew is always on the top of his game and proactive with any issues I've had with the apartment. (Bathroom lights, smoke detector battery replacement). So it's not a lot of issues with the apartment that you get here.

I'm so sad to leave Jia apartments but when you have leave the city there is very little to be done. I also love the lease transfer to another Equity property without breaking the lease. Used it twice so far and had no issues from the management with that.

In short YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I love living at Jia! There are some great food options nearby that are walkable, plus Starbucks onsite!

People here are incredibly nice and have helped me with my groceries on multiple occasions. I’ve met some lovely couples at the resident events the team hosts too.

Thanks to Mike and Kathy who both helped with my move-in! Also thanks, to Erick and Carlos who have helped  make repairs in my home.< /text>

<review>Just moved in about 1~2 weeks ago and so far it's the best experience I've ever had in Los Angeles. Clean amenities, kind/attentive staff (my guy Mike is the best!), monthly events, and it does seem like the Jia/Equity associates really care about the tenants. They even gave out free breakfast this morning with coffee by Starbucks. To anyone thinking about moving into DTLA area, I would strongly recommend this apartments.</review>< date>

<Text>In July, my boyfriend and I moved from SF to LA. During the process, the leasing members at Jia were so helpful. They made sure the entire move in process was flawless! In the time since our move (about 6 months), Kathy and Mike (the office members) have been so helpful! The manager David is on top of everything in the community! He keeps us informed on what is happening in the area, tries to bring the residents together by hosting events, and is even working on planning some additional activities, like yoga, fitness classes, and pool parties!  The maintenance team members are amazing too. They're always willing to go out of their way to help if there is every anything inside your home that needs attention.  We have never had any issues with the community or the complex itself, we absolutely love the area and the experience we have had while living here. The apartments are gorgeous and modern inside, with beautiful views of LA.  We can see downtown LA and Dodger Stadium from our apartment. Overall, this community is beautiful and has so much to offer!  I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in living near DTLA!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

David the manager was more than excellent accommodating and making us feel like home throughout the leasing/moving process. The property was nice with a reasonable pricing on both the rent and parking. Lots of amenities, and also the apartment is modern and functional.< /text>

These apartments are beautiful! I came by for a tour with my husband and we met claudia .. She was super nice and gave us an excellent tour of the apartments. She explained everything we needed to know about the apartment. We are definitely moving in ASAP! I love the view from the top its a great view for the Chinese new years parade and there is a Starbucks right in the corner!<//Text>

<Text>I never had an interest in living in DTLA. But these apartments have changed my mind. These spots are really nice, unique/stylish units, and not nearly at costly as many of the other spots in the area.

Plus there's so much to do in the area but very chill after 6 pm.< /Text>< pics>

First, I would like to thank Art and Alex for all their help on making my move a GREAT one.  Move in was super easy. Everyone including the Community Manager are just amazing and helpful. Second, OMGosh!! These apartments are AMAZING. Beautiful complex, awesome community amenities, AMAZING fitness center, beautiful pool, and my view is the best view ever. I can't express enough how pleased I am with my move.  I look forward to coming home.  I love the area, I love the apartments, and I love the staff.  Truly happy!!! Thank  you, Art, Alex and Meaghan.<//review>

The only reason I gave this place two stars is because I like my actual apartment and the location of the building, and the housekeeping staff keep up well with the slobs that live here. Other than that, it's a free-for-all with parking even though they have assigned spots. Anybody and everybody can get into the parking garage and the guest spots are taken by people who never move. Twice I have found someone parked in my spot (tandem parking is reserved)-and forget asking the "courtesy patrol quote to do anything about it-they won't tow the vehicles. They put a "warning" on the vehicle and it just sits there until it's moved. My experience with the above named patrol, who never did put a warning on the vehicle in my spot, was incredibly unhelpful. I pay rent for this? Do yourself a favor and find a more secure building.
The signs that reserve the mingle room are left out so anyone can say they've reserved the room when they haven't (which I've also reported to the staff and nothing was done.) As I write this, the second garage gate is broken and the door to the stairwell is unlocked. I'm sure it won't be long until I find some homeless guy sleeping in the hallway..<//review>

<Text>I have lived at Jia for about half a year now and can honestly say I love the apartment and the community as a whole. The building is practically brand new, so when I moved in to my apartment it felt like no one had lived in it before me.  It's located at the entrance of Chinatown so it is super accessible to Downtown while also avoiding the high price point of buildings just a few blocks further south. The gym is extensive and ALMOST motivates me to go work out, and the pool is large and has plenty of seating. I only wish it were rooftop so that it got sun throughout more of the day, but the courtyard is wide enough it still gets a nice amount of sun and the pool furniture is great. I work in Santa Monica so I may not end up staying in the DTLA area at the end of my lease, but if I do it will definitely be at Jia.</Text>< user>

My sister lives here, she is military and also manages 3 artists. I visited this property and fell in love.

Doctor Lam is unquestionably one of the finest physicians I have ever met. He is thoroughly prepared to diagnose and discuss my health issues every time I meet with him. He is kind and has a wonderful manner about him. He listens. He pays attention. He cares.
I highly recommend Dr. Giang Lam.<//text>

Wait was horrible. Waited over an hour to be seen and I had an appointment. Nobody ever came to update me on why I wasn’t being seen at my scheduled time or what was going on. Horrible service, but once the doctor came in he apologized for his delay and promptly tended to my needs.<//text>

Dr. Giang Lam is one of the best doctors I have ever had and I am close to 60 yrs. young!  He has motivated me to lose weight by using actions and fitness apps. Other doctors would just use words and shuffle me out of the room. He listens and I appreciate that. I know a Doctors time is valuable and so is mine.  I think he realizes that.

And I wait there for 4 hours.. because I don’t give money...< /Review>< user_name>

I got loaded here, fast check in, fast loading...to the last 3 pallets.
They set those 3 pallets in front of the trailer ready to be loaded and...wait.

It took 2 hours for them to load those 3 pallets. I left by 2pm.
The way they loaded those 47000 pounds i knew that I'm going to be overloaded on tandems for California. No info on bill of lading regarding weight.

I didn't want to waste my day in LA metro since they close by 5pm, that's the reason why i didn't say anything about the way the trailer was loaded.
So...watch the way they load your trailer.< /Text>

Supra National Express is our new choice for a "local" trucking company in Los Angeles for sure.

Humberto knows how to take care of things and is SUPER (or Supra?) responsive. With their new software for tracking it was easy to know where our cargo container was every step of the way from the Port of Long Beach to Houston, TX.

Thanks guys. You were way awesome.

Appreciate the great job.</Review>

<text>Everyday is an adventure at Supra. We are thinkers, we innovate, we create! There is nothing better than being able to work for a company that compliments your talent by providing the necessary tools and support to carry out projects that will undoubtedly leverage and better position Supra against our competitors. The 21st century is now and exciting nonetheless but we at Supra are already working on the solutions of tomorrow.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1534366701693, 'text': 'Supra National Express is a company that always seeks to improve our services!

We at Vitamin King want to thank you guys at Supra National Express for doing such a great job.

You probably get little praise for doing your work but I want to thank you for making sure our cargo from China was not damaged and for making sure all the paperwork for Customs was in order and for delivering it to our warehouse as soon as possible.

Daniel, no complaints here. Thanks!!</text>

Nothing but a 5 Star Review will work for you guys. Picked up all our equipment from the Port of Long Beach and got it to us as soon as possible.

Driver was very professional and paid lots of attention to make sure unloading of equipment was done carefully.</text>

Daniel and the SNE team, you did it. Handled our entire cargo and containers from China with zero difficulty in paperwork, pick-up and delivery to various destinations across CA.

Thanks to the tracking software we knew where our cargo was along each step of the way. It was easier for us and less stressful knowing what to expert, what had been completed and when we should expect the delivery of the cargo to our customers.

I found your company by Google "Best Long Beach trucking company" and found you guys at the top.

For sure you're the best in our book.<//review>

I would like to say I have worked with Supra on some OTR shipments from California to Texas & Nevada.  Their operations is exceptional as they are very informative on the status of shipment and even provided a website I could track the movement of my shipment myself. i thought that was sooo cool! thanks supra keep up the great work.<//review>

It's further than most from my home, but well worth the extra 5 min. drive. My favorite dish is the Singapore Fried Noodles with shrimp, pork, chicken, etc. I don't like food that's too spicy, but these folks cook the hot dishes with just enough spice and offer extra chili sauce if needed. Owners are friendly and food comes out quickly. I've never waited more than 10 mins. The eat-in dining area is small, but comfortable enough. Best to call in and pick up. The portions are generous, and three dishes usually lasts me 2-3 days.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

I have tried 3 times now and I ask every time if they have avocados to make it, and if not I am more then happy to get a different one... each time the answer is the same "yes we have it!" And for some reason each time I get a honey dew... there both green so I guess they taste the same. Looks like I am gonna stop going here over a smoothie.</text>< Pics>

<text>Customer service here is top notch especially the lady boss/cashier. I've been a few times and she always has a sweet welcoming presence. She might be the sole reason some people frequent this place because she adds such a highlight to anyone's day.
The food itself is quite tasty. Typical Chinese cuisine, the usually well seasoned but I did had a very bland order one time I came. The portion sizes are great and the prices are quite cheap.
The restaurant usually isn't very crowded n tucked away in a business Park so it's a nice place to eat with a large group or even just sit in for a bite alone. No need to feel pressured to drag along a buddy. I reccomend giving this place a try if your in the area looking for some convenient Chinese food.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Hard to find decent Americanized Chinese food in San Diego, and this is one of the better places. Very casual. Hot trays or a la carte for lunch.</Text>

Good takeout Chinese food, especially in comparison to those in the Convoy St./Kearny Mesa area where there is an abundance of Asian food.<//review>

Absolutely terrible.  They didn't give me all my food, order was completely wrong, and they refuse to do anything to fix it.  Will NEVER come back.</Review>

I love trying out different branches for Noodles and co, this branch did not disappoint, we arrived around lunch time, the restaurant was nearly empty with only 2 tables occupied, when trying to decide with what to go with, the cashier lady was extremely friendly and helpful in suggesting a few, we ended up with spaghetti Alfredo ( omit the chicken), Mac & cheese for the kids, spicy green shrimp Thai curry(the new bowl that has been recently added to the menu) and garlic bread as a side dish, i really liked the taste of the Alfredo, not too much cheese and sauce that would be too empowering, my hubby on the other hand didn't like the new bowl, the combination between the pineapple, shrimps and sauce just didn't blend well, I'm afraid he would not be coming back to try Noodles and co as a result ,  as for me well lets just say ill have to come solo  from now on<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><Text>A wonderful little noodle shop, in the Fountains of Roseville. Highly worth a visit to the place, to get your fix of noodles.

The noodles were flavorful, and there was enough of them in the Large, however a normal size, is definitely a smaller portion than usual.

Highly worth a visit, and would recommend to anyone wanting noodles.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Just your average pasta, nothing too special. Got a small Mac and cheese with an add on of the breaded chicken breast, I was given the grilled. Also got the dumplings which were average. Seemed like a typical fast food joint (for pasta.) Probably wouldn't visit again. If I want pasta, I'd personally want real Italian.<//Review><user_name>Kelley Smith< /user_name>< Date>

I really don't understand the hype this chain gets, it's overpriced mediocre pasta, you could get boxed pasta from a store that tastes better. Very bland and small portion sizes</Review>

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! My husband and I take our son here all the time!  The food is wonderful and authentic.  The owners have always been the ones that wait on us and they are an adorable middle aged couple from Korea, I think.  They are always very polite! Their orange chicken is the best and they make it from actual orange peels to get the flavor, unlike most place who use that goopy orange flavoring.  They are absolutely wonderful there!! What a little gem in the rough!!<//text>

Love the food! I live near by and always saw it but never called my attention until one night we were feeling lazy and Google "delivery" this place popped up so we tried them out.  Delivery was only 1$!! And the food was fresh! They made it at my request! I now order every other week from here. Great food!!<//review>

Fresh made food. Made when order is place.
Food is not getting warm by light bulbs like in other restaurants. I recommend this place it can come to be a little bit pricey but for full trays of one order. Is worth  the pay. Costumer service  is wonderful. Restaurant need a make over. If your looking for fantasy food  and fantasy restaurant.  This is not the place for you. But if your looking for something good and contruble place to eat. This the is the spot.<//text>

<Review>Been going here over 7 years. Food is consistent. Portions are fair. U just have to get familiar with the menu. Sweet and sour pork,beef broccoli, Mongolian beef,Kung Pao chicken, BBQ spare ribs, chicken broccoli, wonton soup, are my favorites. I would sincerely recommend this place if you live in the area.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>As usual GMC surpasses the mark of quality and professionalism.  I am a believer in how you treat your customers is directly proportional to the quality of service that you receive.  Capital Buick GMC Service Center is the most Proffesional, Quality, and Esteem service department that I have ever experienced.  THANK YOU.  YOU ARE “TOP DRAWER”.
My 2016 Acadia Denali now even runs great and looks great just as when I first purchased it 2015 from Capital Buick GMC.  EXCELLENT SERVICE….
Thank you DAN CASH, you have great GMC Technicians…..</Review><time>1625938174768<//time>< username>

<text>I was helped by Kurtis Smith. I've had a lot of vehicles in for service and Kurtis was by far the best service advisor I have had. Not only were they on time, but actually early. Everything was explained well before and after the repairs. Kirtis went the extra mile to make the entire experience fantastic. Normally, I avoid dealers for post-warranty repairs, but this experience may have changed my mind.< /text><user_id>112729605318622303544< /user_id><time>1626544280330<//time></record>

Outstanding service by Kurtis was told that an update would come on or before 2:00 pm and sure enough he called to give me an update. I was given my opinions on the care of my vehicle no pressure. I chose the option I wanted and they followed through done on time. I will recommend this service department to all friends and family. Thank you Kurtis Smith great job.<//Review>

The service here is amazing. They go the extra mile to make you happy. I had an auto Buttler service yesterday, and also oil change and service. They checked my wipers and changed them so I would be safe.  I have had the car for 2 years, and did not know how to use the screen and Jorge Rodriguez took the time to show me how to use it...</Review>

I bought a new GMC 2500 Denali Diesel. Some of the parts for the options that I ordered were not available. When the parts became available, I scheduled an appointment. They took care of me with exceptional service !< /text>

Extremely happy with the service. I work in the service industry so I definitely know when someone has gone 110%. I appreciate Dan and all his hard work to help me out with my trucks service and recall issues. And to the mechanic for figuring out a daunting issue. A+ service. See Dan if you need to have your vehicle serviced!<//text>

Cordial and professional service every time. Capitol Buick GMC Service Center keeps you updated with your vehicle status. They use all type of communication and follow through with all your requests to completion. Service personal are very knowledgeable and friendly.
My truck is for most times ready within the time I was promised and if any delay, they contact me and update me if time needs to be extended.
I will continue using this Service Center for my GMC truck.
SERVICE ON 7/3/2020: Again and this time with "Jorge Rodriguez" I took my truck for service (recall) and same outstanding service from Jorge. He also will take care of ordering part to replace a weather strip and re-schedule me for installation. Capitol Buick service event included drop off and pick up service using LIFT due to low resources (Tech called in sick) and work was going to take longer than forecast. Great service...<//review>

Without an appointment Gil the service writer was very understanding and agreed to do diagnostics to be sure the battery was my only problem. Which it was. With my concurrence a new battery was installed and I was good to go. So, even without an appointment I received great friedly service.< /text><gmap_id>0x808e335622e5e50d:0xad942f0390dc807e< /gmap_id>< UserId.>

I scheduled an oil change on 12/31, surprisingly that they are still working that day! Nice stuff and quick work. Everything was done smoothly with less than one hour waiting. Overall I am quite satisfied.<//Review>

<review>I had set an appointment for an AUTO BUTLER on 2/5/20 @ 9:00 a.m.  I was greeted nicely and after a few minutes was greeted once again, this time by Guillermo (Gil) Portillo, Service Advisor.  After looking over my car and taking down some notes on his pad, we entered the Service Department.  Gil asked me if I needed transportation anywhere...I told him no, that I was going to have to wait until the car was finished.  He advised me that the coating would take a minimum of 4 hours, and that there was a car in front of me.  I told him that I was there "for the duration" and needed to wait for my vehicle until finished.  While I listened to my I POD, Gil came around and said to me if I would like to go home now?  I looked at my watch, and it was 10:54 a.m.  THAT really surprised me.  I guess Gil took pity on me, said he talked to "his guys" and they promised to get on the job quickly so I wouldn't have to wait that long....and folks, there you are.  Another great visit to Capitol Buick GMC, and I now consider Gil mi amigo, and know that he's really there to help me out.  Thank you very much, Gil!!!!!!!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRPKv7WW1fvjidCcGJaIQ1wP4bhTPSGmcFUVoV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

I recently brought my Terrain to Capitol GMC for an urgent repair. I had the pleasure of meeting Dan Cash and he quickly assured me that he would be able to have my repair done in a timely manner. Dan is professional, friendly, and genuinely cares about helping others. He kept me updated through the process and the prices are fair. I will continue to return to Dan for all my auto service needs in the future.  Thank You Dan!  From a Completely Satisfied Customer, Linda -San Jose< /Review>

I am grateful to the service staff and technicians who finally were able to resolve repeated secondary air pump failures. They identified the fault as faulty  check valves that prevent condensation from feeding back to air pump that would short out the pump. Without the air  pump operation, my vehicle could not pass the emmision test. Check engine lamp = fail test.<//review>

My 2016 Acadia Denali now even runs great and looks great just as when I first purchased it 2015 from Capital Buick GMC.  EXCELLENT SERVICE….

I was helped by Kurtis Smith. I've had a lot of vehicles in for service and Kurtis was by far the best service advisor I have had. Not only were they on time, but actually early. Everything was explained well before and after the repairs. Kirtis went the extra mile to make the entire experience fantastic. Normally, I avoid dealers for post-warranty repairs, but this experience may have changed my mind.<//review>

< Review>
Outstanding service by Kurtis was told that an update would come on or before 2:00 pm and sure enough he called to give me an update. I was given my opinions on the care of my vehicle no pressure. I chose the option I wanted and they followed through done on time. I will recommend this service department to all friends and family. Thank you Kurtis Smith great job.</Review>

The service here is amazing. They go the extra mile to make you happy. I had an auto Buttler service yesterday, and also oil change and service. They checked my wipers and changed them so I would be safe.  I have had the car for 2 years, and did not know how to use the screen and Jorge Rodriguez took the time to show me how to use it...<//review>

Cordial and professional service every time. Capitol Buick GMC Service Center keeps you updated with your vehicle status. They use all type of communication and follow through with all your requests to completion. Service personal are very knowledgeable and friendly.
My truck is for most times ready within the time I was promised and if any delay, they contact me and update me if time needs to be extended.
I will continue using this Service Center for my GMC truck.
SERVICE ON 7/3/2020: Again and this time with "Jorge Rodriguez" I took my truck for service (recall) and same outstanding service from Jorge. He also will take care of ordering part to replace a weather strip and re-schedule me for installation. Capitol Buick service event included drop off and pick up service using LIFT due to low resources (Tech called in sick) and work was going to take longer than forecast. Great service...<//review>

<review>The battery on my truck died after 4 years. A jump start gave me enough power to get to Capitol Buick. Without an appointment Gil the service writer was very understanding and agreed to do diagnostics to be sure the battery was my only problem. Which it was. With my concurrence a new battery was installed and I was good to go. So, even without an appointment I received great friedly service.</review>< resp>

Since Kurtis started handling my stuff when I come. So much better. Communication is outstanding. Called me three times to keep me informed of my services. Was straight up with me. Before I was upset I bought the service there. Because I was totally unsatisfied. Now things are looking up. Also the service they did on my truck was outstanding as well. Thank you Kurtis and mechanics.</review>

I had set an appointment for an AUTO BUTLER on 2/5/20 @ 9:00 a.m.  I was greeted nicely and after a few minutes was greeted once again, this time by Guillermo (Gil) Portillo, Service Advisor.  After looking over my car and taking down some notes on his pad, we entered the Service Department.  Gil asked me if I needed transportation anywhere...I told him no, that I was going to have to wait until the car was finished.  He advised me that the coating would take a minimum of 4 hours, and that there was a car in front of me.  I told him that I was there "for the duration" and needed to wait for my vehicle until finished.  While I listened to my I POD, Gil came around and said to me if I would like to go home now?  I looked at my watch, and it was 10:54 a.m.  THAT really surprised me.  I guess Gil took pity on me, said he talked to "his guys" and they promised to get on the job quickly so I wouldn't have to wait that long....and folks, there you are.  Another great visit to Capitol Buick GMC, and I now consider Gil mi amigo, and know that he's really there to help me out.  Thank you very much, Gil!!!!!!!<//Review>

I recently brought my Terrain to Capitol GMC for an urgent repair. I had the pleasure of meeting Dan Cash and he quickly assured me that he would be able to have my repair done in a timely manner. Dan is professional, friendly, and genuinely cares about helping others. He kept me updated through the process and the prices are fair. I will continue to return to Dan for all my auto service needs in the future.  Thank You Dan!  From a Completely Satisfied Customer, Linda -San Jose</Text>

<review>Great frozen yogurt. It's the wife's favorite place from when she was a kid, and it's pretty much the same as it was back then. Serving sizes are enormous (think Paunch Burger on the show "Parks and Rec"). There are plenty of candies and other sweets that can be mixed in with your yogurt. It's a great throwback to the ambience of places when you went to when you were a kid.

Only accepts cash.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOl7al0EmglLWbtMAgLbdsLlI9j0ramC1PrhLS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnZvhAlI5IHseYbJ2qlOBGd_I8d4KKXaWbLM8z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

Very good frozen yogurt. I've seen some people complain about the price, but there is almost always a line at the door waiting to buy. If you aren't willing to pay the price then go to the grocery store. You will be one less person ahead of me the next time I go for frozen yogurt.< /Review>

<review>The one and only! Always a line going out the door but for a good reason - and they move very quickly.  Different daily selection of flavors and lots of topping choices keeps things new.
The sizes are generously large, the prices are mercifully low and the quality is consistent high.
Keep up the good work!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIxvlV6TGLBTlJRN3PSpUv1gPiWfbEfCo2O7Jm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Wow! If you love frozen yogurt with toppings this is The Place. Having topping throughout is a must for me. You don't have to worry about having an empty bite.  The workers here take the extra step in placing your toppings on the bottom, middle and top! Smooth creamy yogurt! This will be the only place in San Diego I will go for frozen yogurt!</text>< pics>

The yogurt mill is my favorite yogurt place they are popular for their big cups of yogurt for a decent price. If you look online you can always print out a coupon for buy one get one free. That's a lot of free yogurts!! They have different flavors to choose from every day. I highly recommend suggesting this product when looking for an excellent place to buy yogurt. My husband and I are both obsessed with the yogurt mill.< /review>

Loved their red velvet flavor with roasted almonds and peanuts....sooo delicious! My pesky siblings nearly cleared out my whole cash stash for this place before I even got to order....remember baby size is perfect for one adult and comes with two toppings after that I would recommend sharing, unless you feel the stomach ache is worth it< /review>

<review>So my god sister told me about this place that seems to literally be a gem in east county. I've lived in san Diego all my life & never knew about this place. The yogurt here is delicious. Nice treat to enjoy & definitely beat the heat. We learned about "baby drop" or "junior drop" & that was cool, trust me when you go there just mention that to them and they'll explain. Also I hear that the 7 eleven near them sometimes has coupons in the reader or local magazine. I'm not in east county alot, but for sure when I am, I will be back . My husband got PB with brownie & Reese's peanut butter cups pieces , my mother in law got a baby PB  yogurt with reese's pieces & roasted peanuts , and I got a child on & strawberry really enjoyed it. Also our cashier was really nice and she actually gave me the recommendation for my yogurt. Yummy! Guidelines are in place for covid , the greeter was wonderful as well.

I heard they switch up the flavors at times. This place has really good yogurt & a variety of toppings. Also remember this place is Cash only !< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Yogurt Mill is my family’s favorite yogurt by far, but lately, the continuity of their serving sizes has become quite unpredictable, and we will not be coming back every week anymore. It’s frustrating to order the same size every time, but get less and less in the cup. Today we purchased 4 child’s dropped and each one got progressively less filled.  When I pointed it out to the employee, she just looked at me and continued bagging the order. Definitely have not been feeling like we’re getting our moneys worth.< /review>< Pics>

Well organized and courtious employees. Great product. Their frozen yogurt is the best. I usually get the large chocolate with a lid. They offer toppings. I tried the jelly beans once, don't recommend it though. Once they get cold in the frozen yogurt, they're hard like rocks. So, if you want jelly beans I recommend asking for them on the side...<//Review>

<Review>All "white" preferenced employee culture. This is something going on for years by owners regulations.  You will not see anyone of other ethnicity working at this place. In regards to employees @ this place, there is a small frame petite young girl working there, she tends to use braids,  stay away from her ,she is rude and has no idea what customer service is 😑.<//Review>< pics>

I’ve been going to this Yogurt Mill since I was a child. I love Yogurt Mill! The only reason why I’m not giving it 5 stars is because it’s cash only, but there a Market right next door that has an ATM outside. Wheelchair friendly & the building is always a fun sight to see!< /Text>

A fixture in the community for almost 30 years, the yogurt selection and great prices keep bringing back people. You can't go wrong with any of their flavors and it's great to chat with other people while in line. Don't forget to check out their coupon online for a two for one special.</text>

Best Fro-Yo in SD period! I really admire how the staff has quickly adapted to the new restrictions. They wipe down all surfaces and limit your contact to surfaces and doors. The standard has been set. Much respect.<//text>

Good entry procedures require masks and distance between customers. Someone handles the doors to enter and exit. Two tables for cashiers to handle payments for customers so servers aren't handling cash! Of course the nonfat and low fat selections are great and very tasty as always!! Love this place!</review>

Yogurt Mill is my family’s favorite yogurt by far, but lately, the continuity of their serving sizes has become quite unpredictable, and we will not be coming back every week anymore. It’s frustrating to order the same size every time, but get less and less in the cup. Today we purchased 4 child’s dropped and each one got progressively less filled.  When I pointed it out to the employee, she just looked at me and continued bagging the order. Definitely have not been feeling like we’re getting our moneys worth.</Text>

<Review>This place is an El Cajon staple. Amazing prices for delicious froyo. The place has a menu that changes daily and you can check the daily flavors from their Instagram account. Just a warning, the child size is plenty and almost too much for one person.</Review>< rating>

This place is hands down the best yogurt place in El Cajon.
Great yogurt, great prices, friendly staff, and they post their daily favors on social media.
Don't believe me? I challenge you to go visit there for a after dinner dessert. I would be surprise if there isn't a line out the door. It's that good.<//Review>

I love the serving sizes they have. Such good prices for even the largest size. Gotta plan for a wait because there always seems to be a line out the door. Cash only also! They will let you sample every flavor which I recommend because the flavors change daily. Great staff, amazing place for dessert. Highly recommended!<//Text>

Awesome frozen yogurt with new flavors daily. We stop here every time we're here traveling from Minnesota. Cash only and you may need to wait in line, but definitely with it.</Review>

Great froyo! Good service and an amazing amount of yogurt for the price. Cash only, so be prepared, but so worth it! While we were there, someone came in from WA saying that while he was visiting, he had to visit since he used to come when he was in college, 20 years ago.< /text>

Whenever my daughter (now 45) got a good report card, her reward was the Yogurt Mill! And since we moved away, it is still the only frozen yogurt place that serves coconut plus more than you expect! It's our first place to visit on our return visits! Don't leave!!!<//Text>

<Review>Always delicious but I recommend printing a coupon (make sure it is printed out!) because it gets pricey 😉 The lines do get very long and they only have a small sit down area. Plan to be there a while and to enjoy your treat else where. Otherwise it is a wonderful place with yummy deliciousness and kind employees!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The yogurt mill is definitely the best place to go get frozen yogurt. On summer nights you can easily wait up to 30 minutes trying to get a yogurt. The line is visible from the street. If that doesn't tell you how good the yogurt is wait until you see the sizes. You can drop any of the smaller sizes into the next size up for 10 cents! Try their yogurt. It really is good. And don't forget to tip! Those kids deserve it!</Review>

Super quaint little place. Cash only. There is a little spot next door with an atm though. The cookie butter is to die for but it's not always on the menu. I love that they change it up.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This is THE PLACE to go if you want GREAT Frozen Yogurt!!  The lines in the evening can be long, but it's well worth it!!  Their Frozen Yogurt far exceeds any place else any where else!!  Visiting in line with people you don't even know is great fun!!  Lots of interesting info exchanged.
They have all kinds of toppings for your yogurt as well, dry or wet.
Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.  You may have a little trouble deciding what to get.<//text>< response>

< Review>
Husband and I were visiting family in the area from AZ... Husband use to go here when he was a kid and said it was "awesome".
When we arrived we were rushed into ordering without being able to try any samples. We ordered the "child" size which is about a 4 cup serving. I hastily ordered coffee, my husband thin mint. To our dismay, the yogurt was not good quality, and the coffee had a horrible aftertaste. Because I work in the Customer Service industry I did not want to be "that customer", so I had my husband purchase me a new yogurt in the smallest size and pay for it. When we were attempting to leave, I asked the attendants if they had a place in back that would be more suitable to throw away the ridiculous amount of coffee yogurt instead of their outdoor trashcans. The attendant made it a point that she would like to give our money back because I shouldn't have payed for a replacement. When she consulted her more senior coworker on the subject, she proceeded to loudly explain that because we ordered a different size and did not ask them to begin with, they could not refund my money. After hearing her explain this three times, I was finally able to get a word in. "I do not want my money back, all I want is for you to throw this away for me." I left, and as my husband was leaving both workers apologized and said they hope that we would return. He explained "we won't, we're from AZ and we will never stop here again".</Review>

<text>They have many flavors to choose from with some being constant while others changed out on a daily basis to keep things fresh. Also, their topping selection is quite generous. Lastly, their staff is always friendly. The only knock on this place is that they only take cash but that's not a big deal if you know in advance and prepare accordingly.</text></record>

The best yogurt ever a little pricey but the servings more than make up for the price. All ground level easy access. On hot days you can count on a long line . It moves quickly and it's so worth the
wait.If you like yogurts You will Love this place.< /text>

The best yogurt in town! The servings are enormous, the staff is great & the prices are incredible! Seriously we come here at least twice a week. We have even had this for dinner! And when we remember to bring a coupon it's even better! I love the tarts, the wife loves the sweets 😋<//Text>

<Text>So many great flavors and extras, nice staff, nice customers. I've not been there for a while, but once the weather warms up, you can expect regular visits again. I've loved the place as long as I've been here, and since I've been here in El Cajon all of my life, that's quite a compliment. Thanks!<//Text>< pictures>

This place has been around forever...and for a reason:  it is absolutely wonderful frozen yogurt.  Sure, there will be a line, parking will be a dicey proposition, you'll need a printed coupon and they are cash only.  Know what?  It is worth any hassle you might initially feel.  The portions are huge and they double cup which makes for a nicer eating experience when tackling one of these beauties.  Located in a leaning tower that you can't miss.  It is a local landmark.<//text>

Although the yogurt is good the attitude on the eemployees was appalling. While in line another customer saw i had a coupon for a buy 1 yogurt get 1 free and he politely asked me where i got it, i pointed across the street to Grenada liquor and said they're in the free coupon ad right there. The dirty looks from the employees then ensued. I mean jeez you'd think i robbed the place and got away with it from the looks of the teenage employees. If you don't like the coupons then why continually put them in the adverts? I'll go elsewhere thanks! But only after telling everyone where to find those coupons.< /review>

Also, their topping selection is quite generous. Lastly, their staff is always friendly. The only knock on this place is that they only take cash but that's not a big deal if you know in advance and prepare accordingly.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>La creme de la creme.  Head and shoulders above just about any other fro-yo shop, The Yogurt Mill consistently serves up some of the best-tasting cold stuff money can buy.  They not only have very competitive pricing but a wide range of flavors and such features as sugar-free, fat-free or even dairy-free ices, for those on special diets.

My personal favorites are low-fat, low-sugar cheesecake and coconut.  Add just about any fruit topping and you have an out-of-this-world treat.  Especially delicious on a hot day!</Review><user_name>Michael Patrick King<//user_name>< user_id>

Amazing frozen yogurt! Grab their BOGO coupon online and print it before you go...the don't accept it off your phone. Cash only. Great selection of flavors, that change daily, so call ahead to see what they have. You won't be disappointed. Super friendly staff. Gets super crowded during warm days.< /review>

<text>Amazing yogurt! I got a small and we shared it between two people and were full after. That's how much you get. The yogurt is delicious and the typing are so hard to choose from. I recommend the cheesecake bites. I'm told there is a long line sometimes but we went on a weeknight in January so we got in just fine. Staff is super friendly and wool explain to first times the process. Long drive for me but definitely going back.< /text></record>

Been going to the yogurt mill for almost 30 years. Great flavors and always polite help . Most time the get a line in the evenings that may last until almost close . Especially  during the warm months but even tonight with 50 degree temp there was a small line of faithful customers  waiting to enjoy the great frozen yogurt.< /text>

Cash only.

Yogurt and toppings are good, good portions (they pack them solid, no air), friendly service.

If you go at a popular time expect a bit of a wait.<//Text>

Service varies by cashier. Some provide that homey feel, others not so much. The yogurt itself is incredible. They do not take online coupons so make sure you visit their site for any deals before you drive there-the girl told me she could only honor it if it was printed.<//Text>

Still a genuine yogurt destination just like when I was a kid! Make sure to bring cash, because no EBT, credit, or debit cards will be accepted... Also, no digital coupons.</review>

Always great yogurt but it's cash only. If you go at the wrong time you will easily have a line out the door but it's worth the wait. I recommend the peanut butter.</text>

It's the only place I go to for frozen yogurt.  It has 4 or 5 base flavors that are always present, but 3 to 4 that rotate and change.  Free samples are present with great service the times I've went.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Best frozen yogurt in town. The line can be a little long but they usually make short work of processing customers. My only suggestion would be to put a canopy outside for the people in line, the El Cajon summers can be brutal when you're standing out on the asphalt. It would also help with the line control, seems that people aren't too keen to reading signs.< /text>< Pictures>

Their flavors are amazing and constantly have different varieties. They also put your topping throughout the whole cup (on the bottom, middle, and top) so it isn't just on the top which is a bonus! I don't like to get yogurt anywhere else!!</Review>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>I used to love this place but then came realize there was nothing really spectacular about their yogurt. I'll  stop to get some if there is not a long wait. It's  not worth  the wait in my opinon. There are other places or other ways to obtain yogurt instead of wasting time waiting I  line.< /Text>< Pics>

Love this place!  I grew up in El Cajon and this was one of my favorite places to go for a treat. It has been around for years and is the one reason I would come back to El Cajon. Fantastic frozen yogurt like no one else  can make! Serving is huge! And the servers are always nice.</review>

<Text>Yogurt is high quality compared to other places! It doesn't seem as watery and doesn't melt as fast. You can aslo get more for your money than those places that charge by weight so that's great. Only thing is the lines are longgg and the workers are slow so you'll have to wait but it's worth it!</Text><rate>5< /rate>< response>

A Neighborhood favorite. Always a line out the door. You can always use a BOGO coupon printed from the website. They do not take credit cards. Different flavors daily. You can see them on their Facebook page so you can choose before you go. Samples are given upon request.< /review>

A local gem of places to find in El Cajon that locals love for good reason. They change the yogurt flavors every day to keep things interesting.< /review>

When I think of a great place to have a cold treat, I always think of the Yogurt Mill. They always have great flavors (but they change daily so call ahead or check their Instagram). My favorite flavor is Oreos and Cream, which is offered every Thursday. This frozen Yogurt shop offers really big portions, and has lots of "buy one get one free" coupons all the time.  Make sure to bring one for you, and print an extra for a friend/neighbor.  Bring your cash.  This shop is CASH ONLY, but totally worth it.</Text>

By far beat all the other yogurt mills that are out there. But my 4 star is because they only take cash no debit or credit.</review>

< Review>
I've been here twice and I'm never coming back here. Let's see, where to start:

They don't seem to offer individual sizes; in my opinion they have: baby size cup and the other cups they offer are better fit for extremely large people. The only reason I came back once was because there's always a long line that catches my attention; it makes you think it's a place worth going to, but as soon as I stepped into the business, I remember why I hate it: slow workers (who don't even offer napkins?), not enough chairs/space, not interesting atmosphere (gold rush decoration mixed with 7/11 lighting), they don't take debit/credit cards, few choices on toppings,. Their yogurt is not bad, but it isn't unique in any way either.

Skip the lines and visit your closet yogurt</Review>

OMG this spot is the best spot to get frozen yogurt I love the idea of alternating different flavors on different days that makes you keep coming back to their establishment I personally love the cheese cake bites with a raspberry or the coffee flavor with nuts and toffee< /review>

Favorite yogurt place.  Be sure to bring cash though. Always ask them to drop it into a larger cup. You get way more for your money.</Text>

Good frozen yogurt. The place used to be a pizza place cleverly called The Leaning Tower of Pizza. (it was styled like it). I was dissapointed when they closed it without me ever buying a pizza there, even though I alwasys intended to. My dissapointment was somewhat assuaged when they re-opened it as the Yogurt Mill, have added a stirrer to the tower to resemble a churn. Tres clever I must say. If you are nearby, stop in. :)</Text>

I've been here twice and I'm never coming back here. Let's see, where to start:

They don't seem to offer individual sizes; in my opinion they have: baby size cup and the other cups they offer are better fit for extremely large people. The only reason I came back once was because there's always a long line that catches my attention; it makes you think it's a place worth going to, but as soon as I stepped into the business, I remember why I hate it: slow workers (who don't even offer napkins?), not enough chairs/space, not interesting atmosphere (gold rush decoration mixed with 7/11 lighting), they don't take debit/credit cards, few choices on toppings,. Their yogurt is not bad, but it isn't unique in any way either.

Skip the lines and visit your closet yogurt<//text>

This place is the worst! The girls that work there are stupid and rude and lazy. The quality of the product is very poor. Their prices are too high and the selection is crap. The place appears clean but it is NOT. I am disgusted that this place is still in business, considering how everything about it is just way below standard.< /review>

Amazing ice cream but a little pricey. Make sure to check their Facebook for coupons.

FYI. They want you to print it out and not just show them the coupon on your phone.< /text>

<text>Been going here for 25+ years, and it's still the best yogurt out there. Portions are always enough, their not skimpy with the toppings either. I have never found the service to be rude as some have stated! Sometimes, I believe, there is such a long wait ( cause the yogurts great! ) and it's so hot while you're waiting outside...you the customer gets cranky...Just sayin'. And yes, the building is old...so what! The only time I have seen it "un-tidy" is when they are so busy they may not have the time to stop and clean up right away. Ultimately, it has an "A" rating in the window.

You can also go on Facebook to check out their flavors for the day, before you go!< /text>< Gmap_id>

They gave great yogurt flavors,very friendly staff. I actually came in when a lady came in yelling at the owner, I'm not sure what it was about but the cashier who served her handled it very professionally.<//Review>

<review>The yogurt itself is to die for however the service over the last year has really declined. The staff is much slower, less friendly, and spend to much time talking among themselves all the time which contributes to portion size either being too much or too little. Hello... I'm a paying customer pay attention to me please!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80d9584d7d51e5a5:0x9359eb170c7bd46</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
