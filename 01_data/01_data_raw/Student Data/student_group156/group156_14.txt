<Review>This place is great !! Usually very fast and do a great job with my nails and brows .. only thing I have to say is with some techs you have to make sure what u want or need and don’t assume they will remember to do it .. might have to remind them .. example for me is making my nails extra thick so they last longer 😉</Review>< Pics>

service was mediocre. i like the shape but the acrylic nail was done way to far from my skin. it looks as if i got them done a week ago when i got them done today. i also had to ask for the $5 cuticle service. i would not go again. $30 total.</review>

<review>It's our first time at this nail place. The lady that did the acrylic on my niece was really nice.   I would give the lady that helped me personally--a 2 star because she was very persistent trying to up sell me and started criticizing my eyebrows,  etc so I would get it done.  She also didn't want to touch up one of my nails because it started to bubble. After pointing it out, she said she doesn't see anything, but when I asked another lady,  she and the other ladies (even though I couldn't understand) sounded like they were correcting her and to fix it. In doing so,  she was saying I must have hit it somewhere. 🤔 I would definitely go back,  just not to that same lady with the round glasses.  I rated this place a 5 star for everything and everyone else... except for her.  Otherwise,  I would have given this place a 2 star just with that lady alone.< /review><name>Jane Doe<//name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5<//Rate><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

We had never been to this place before but the place we normally go to was closing soon so we tried this place. We got there at 530 and they close at 7. 2 gel fills and 2 relaxation pedicures cost us $53 a piece. I gave them 2 stars cause I love all the colors they had to choose from but when it came to service it sucked! They didn't use clean tools for our pedicure, they rushed through doing our nails but had plenty of time to talk to eachother and laugh and joke. My nails are not smooth and the color isn't what I asked for. My toes weren't filed and she scrubbed my heels til it hurt and I had to ask her to stop. So disappointed. Never going back!<//text>

I absolutely love Nails & Spa! This is the 1st Nail Shop that I visited when I moved from San Diego to Temecula 2 years ago and I would never want to go anywhere else. They do an amazing job and are just overall great people. I highly recommend them!<//review>

<Review>The lady was nice but she made my fingers bleed when cutting my cuticles. The woman who did my pedicure never even scrubbed my callus on my heels. Even after asking her to because usually a basic peidcure it's still included. I was told no because callus remover wasn't included. Nail polish was left around my toe nails. Pedicure is cheap but they charge an extra $5 for anything other then polish and lotion. I definitely won't be back.<//Review>< pictures>

They are always friendly here.  I love the way my nails look after.  They treat you like you are their most important client. Their prices are reasonable. And they can always squeeze me in just walking in.</Review>

< Review>
I'm the pickiest person I know when it comes to getting my nails done, but I'm also completely happy to pay and tip well for a top notch experience.  I want a strong massage and will usually order an extra 10-20 minutes, depending on my week so far.  I want service verging on spoiling, and I don't mind having a conversation with my nail technician but I HATE when they speak Vietnamese to each other and laugh while I'm wondering if it's about me.  Once they see that I'm in the "zone", I want to be able to sink into my chair and drift off.

I get ALL OF THIS at Nails & Spa... and more.  They recognize me, call me by name, always provide a cold water bottle, and they are genuinely NICE people.  They have a million gel choices, a great selection of polishes, and I get a monthly wax (I won't admit it, though) and NEVER have red blotchy marks on my face.  I rarely have the ability to make an appointment, but they always seem able to accommodate.

Of all the places I've gone, this is the one I keep returning to because they are kind, considerate and CONSISTENT.  There are 2 nail places in this center, so make sure you're at the one right next to the tattoo shop!!</Review>

<review>Good pedicures. Manicure was nothing to brag about. Prices start on the cheaper end but they nickle and dime you up in price. There was a sulfur type of foul smell for a while and then it went away. Staff wasn't particularly friendly either. My eyebrow wax turned out good though.  I would only go back out of sheer desperation AND if I was broke.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

Me and three friends went to Nails and Spa today on a whim. We'd just eaten at Denny's and had been planning on going to a different salon to get our nails done, but walked across the parking lot to Nails and Spa instead. After being turned away at the other nearby salon (because only two women were working), the employees at Nails and Salon were friendly and professional and welcomed us in with no problem! They were able to get all four of us done in no time, and we were all so happy with the jobs they did!

They were such a great place for us to have our girls day, and for me to get my first professional manicure!

If I want to do it again, I'll definitely be coming back here.<//Text>

This place was great! I ordered the Kimchi Chasu Miso Ramen and the proportion was very big. It was delicious, the chasu was super tender and melted instantly in my mouth. My boyfriend had the chicken katsu plate and the proportion were huge also! I would recommend. Serve was great too.<//text>

<review>I absolutely love this place! The first day that I ate there, I went back to order again. Their #30 Chicken Katsu Rice 🍚 with Katsu Sauce is incredible (Tai Hao Le!). Their food is affordable and cooked to perfection. It is "family owned" and far better than any Asian "Chain restaurant". I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to discover this little hidden gem. It just opened, but the food tastes like it's been mastered by years of cultural refinement.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYCEc4VFu3PZdQTcMrWbFsH4IiKP7ajknzeUBU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Seemingly family owned they off a wide variety of appetizing meals on their menu. I decided to have the chicken katsu bowl. It is an outstanding bowl of steam rice layered with caramelized onions, chicken Katsu and egg with green onions and seaweed. This bowl is filling with its larger then average portion size. I personally find larger portions sizes not to amazing but the food here is really good. Along with an attentive staff and a quiter then average environment.</text><rate>4</rate><username>kat Muller<//username>< userid>

The meatballs are really good though, and the portions are just right. Service was polite but not very present. Nothing about this place is Bad, but everything could have been a bit better.</review></record>

I came for a dinner with my wife and 2-year old and we ordered ramen for us and gyoza for the child. Everything that came was clean, correct, well-balanced, and literally flawless. No mistakes were made. In a world where restaurants are constantly trying to outdo each other by making flavors bolder and more heavily seasoned, it takes courage and skill for a restaurant to serve food less salty, less ostentatious, like you might cook for yourself at home. These folks did it, and they did it right.< /Text>

<Date>1580596416766<//Date><rate>4</rate><review>These ramen bowl servings were super generous! I ordered the gyoza ramen and it was delicious! The broth was super tasty. It seems to be a family run restaurant, so you get really personal, friendly service. The ramen bowls are moderately priced, between $8.95 and $11.95–and totally worth your buck because they have plenty of noodles, a generous piece of meat and a tasty half egg. I just wish they would add some seaweed! Plenty of seating, lots of 4 seater tables on a Saturday midday.

Absolutely love it!!! Miso is probably my favorite broth but my go to is the number one I believe it's the house special. In terms of flavor the miso broth is out of this world.  I definitely reccomend everything is homemade family recipes and the couple that owns it is awesome.< /Review>

Not bad, a bit too salty for my taste. Ordered the chashu ramen, it was missing some of the things I've come to expect with ramen (ginger, menma, and nori). But it did some with some thick slices of pork.<//text>

<review>Wow. This place exceeded my expectations in taste, portion size and an affordable cost. Had the charsu ramen with lots of charsiu and bean sprouts and great ramen noodles. You can choose what type of noodle is in your soup and it comes with a boiled egg and green onions.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80945d25942f4f0d:0x2d2d60c728e6a6b9</gmapID></record>

Great new family run ramen place. The service is great, food comes out fast, and everything is delicious. The miso kimchi ramen is AMAZING. The gyoza are good, and the yakisoba is good. I have yet to be disappointed.< /Review>

Our dining experience was less than acceptable. They were understaffed; one waitress and a hostess seemed to be handling all of the service. The waitress refilled some drinks once, the hostess refilled two drinks one other time. They forgot to cook an entire meal whenever the waitress finally brought the food. Steaks had to be sent back up to two times because they were undercooked. Had to ask for two steaks to be redone. Whenever the manager was called over he was very unprofessional, becoming angry with our complaints and telling us we did not have to come back. The soap dispenser in the women's restroom was empty. Food was decent whenever it arrived properly. Restaurant was clean but the service left much to be desired.< /Text>

<Text>The food was excellent! The service was awesome. It's a bar with the usual bar flies so it's noisy. TVs everywhere. The beer selection was minimal, but if you want a great bite to eat, the selection is great and the food is really tasty!</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Dive in a good way. Steak was awesome. People were great. However, they need more Irish whiskey. I had to educate the barkeep as I settled for what they had.</Review>< Rating>

We love fish and chips,  corned beef sliders good but could be sold at a lower price. We have had shepherds pie which was huge and heavenly. Lobster over priced but it's Probably good. I can get 10.00 lobster on Mondays that would blow you away... but over all. We lo very it here.its our getaway! !!!!</Text><Name>Rose H. W</Name>< userid>

<review>Love this spot, great food and atmosphere. Gary is a cool dude always walking around checking up on customers to see how things are going. My buddies and I have pretty much made this our spot when we have our monthly get togethers. He's got all the games on and the staff is super cool too. Love their corn beef sandwich!< /review><Date>1481928136634<//Date><UserId.>106312895586222422131<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Great Irish pub. Booths have private TVs to watch whatever they want. I took a gluten free friend here and she was blown away by their gluten free menu. She ordered a gluten free beer and gluten free hamburger and told me that combo is next to impossible to find at a bar.< /text>

If you only get the garlic mushrooms Skosh Monahan's is worth going to but I warn you, come with an appetite and if you order the garlic mushrooms, share them. They are tender, juicy, seasoned just right and there are a lot of them! Served with fresh sliced French or Italian bread they are a meal in themselves!

The ribeye steak would have been really good if it was a slightly better cut of well marbled meat. As it was the seasoning was fine and it was definitely more than just edible. The vegetables however, gave new meaning to the word "al dente." Cooking them for another 30 seconds to a minute would have made them perfect. As with everything else, there were plenty of them.

The service was excellent and cordial. The atmosphere was a bit more subdued than your typical Sports Bar which I considered good. I don't like to be deafened while I eat. Prices won't bankrupt you but I wouldn't rate them on the low end of moderate either.

All in all, this place is definitely worth a visit if you are anywhere nearby.<//text>

The food was hot and delicious the micro brew was great! Our server was fast, nice, efficient and informative. We visited on a Monday night around 7pm. Had the New York strip cooked to medium perfection. The mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious and stayed hot thru the entire meal! My dining companion had the Ribeye. He proclamed it very good, however the medium rare he ordered was a little to done for his tastes.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>This is one of the worst places I've ever ate. Where do I begin, the food was cold when we got it, I ordered the artichoke as my meal its was cold, dry the leaves had no artichoke meat on them it was dryed out awful. So I order the bacon wrapped shrimp looked pretty good my friend had ordered it his was cold to though and he waited to eat until I got my shrimp well the server kept saying mine is coming right up after 20 I said forget it this is a joke very rude of them knowing I had a guest with me. After I got my horrible food u started watching all the food sitting up on the counter waiting to bring to tables I witnessed food sitting there for over 5 minutes no heat lamps it wasn't even busy mind you. Very annoying, also there is s bar there I saw the owner sitting drinking at the bar with a bunch of stumbling drunk locals very bad specially if you had kids with you, you have to walk by the bar to get to the restroom. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else trust me.< /review>< Pictures>

Dog friendly patio and staff.  Amazing food from burgers and steaks to bomb nachos to stroganoff and shepards pie. Good for sports. Good pours.  Not a fan of the apple cobler, not much apple to it and just kinda mushy sweet bread crumbs. Everything else is a slam dunk.< /review>

<Text>Due to drinking, and lack of attention to the customer, attention by bar management and employee s was slow.
The management was socializing with local customers , I was forced to find my way to the bar to find service and a menu.

< Review>
We are working on remodeling several homes in Rancho Mirage, and Floor & Decor is our store of choice for every kind of stone we need for our floors, bathrooms, fireplace, kitchen, and patio.  From ceramic to marble, travertine to stack stone, this store has it all!  We were thoroughly impressed with the customer service we received from everyone.  All employees - from the register to those helping pick out our stones to those who helped load the product - were very professional.  A special note of appreciation to the store manager, Marty, who always welcomes us with a friendly face and helps us find what we need.  The selection, pricing, and service beats out the traditional big box stores.  Highly recommend Floor & Decor!<//Review>

<Review>Big flooring and wall tile store. Lots of ideas. Buy enough for your current project, but don't plan they will have the same stock months later as it constantly changes. They also carry tools and trim. Better than the big hardware stores.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I was a bit overwhelmed at first because there was so much to take in from great displays to a wide arrange of tiles, woods, and countertops and all the employees were friendly and were very helpful. Watch out Home Depot, Lowes, and other tile shops around the valley because you will definitely have to step up your game when it comes to customer services and selection of products.  Floor and Décor also has FREE design consulting which will help in choosing your tile for your home projects.</review>< pics>

Well I have been sitting here for 1 hour on a curbside pick up. Not very professional to say the least. They can’t find my order that said it’s ready for pickup. Really not happy but they have loaded 10 other people up. Hard to believe I had to go and find out what’s going on.< /Review>

<Text>I agree with Maggie! Customer service is non existent here. So many options it’s overwhelming and for someone like me who’s clueless help would’ve been appreciated. Their pricing isn’t great like they boast if you pay attention. 2 stars because there was some nice stuff, but no one helps you so I won’t be purchasing here. Management give your staff a lesson in customer service ASAP.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1593290148328, 'text': 'We regret any inconvenience you encountered during your visit.

<Review>One thing that stands out about a store is customer service. Not once did anyone ask my family and I if we needed any help. The store was not busy. We are in the process of remodeling some things in our home and the store will not be my first choice. It left me with a bad impression. As far as products they do have a variety. Pricing is more than at other places.< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Great small town theater in all the areas that count: vibrant picture, clear and well placed sound, and very comfortable seating. The staff was friendly and the popcorn is seriously some of the best movie theater popcorn I've ever had. And for all of this, the ticket prices are very reasonable. I would be happy to watch any movie at this location.< /review>

I'm very much like this movie 🎬 theater 🍿.
It is historical but equipped up to date.
It is very unique, on the elevation above the sea level, in the mountains. You likely will find many free seats there and maybe even the entire hall can be yours for watching your favorite movie. Employees very friendly, they make very good popcorn 🍿and providing great service.</review>

Great little theater.  Happy it's still around.  My first visit was January 1970 when several of us went to watch South Pacific. Most recently we went to see 1917.<//Review>

The staff is extremely friendly which is what you expect in a small town theater. The screening rooms have comfortable chairs and are well air conditioned for a comfortable viewing environment.  The prices are reasonable. All around it's a good theater, and usually fairly empty so there's always opportune seating available. Love it.< /review>

Love coming here. The movie theater crew always makes us feel like we're at home. The sound balancing in the movies is perfect, not like other theaters were the sound effects are 10,000 times louder then anything else in the movie. You actually can hear the movies.< /review>

<user>109327886322224970478<//user><Text>For a small town historic theater, this place is awesome. The individual theatres are small, especially compared to big city cinemas, but the chairs were comfortable, plenty of leg room. The sound was on point, the picture clear. I watched Bohemian Rhapsody, and was amazed at the quality of the sound. The theater itself is very historic, and well worth the visit just for that factor. It really reminds you of being back in the days of neon, the 40s and 50s. Definitely recommend this place!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Jeff, the manager will do anything to provide the best customer service experience and he has on many many occasions. He is phenomenal! It is kept very clean inside, the food prices are reasonable and the popcorn is second to none. It's a very well run, safe, family-oriented experience. The chairs are comfortable, the sound system is up to date and they even serve wine.< /text>

<Review>First: Where is BOMBSHELL? So eager to see this! Do I have to go to Regal Cinema in Sonora? 😢

Me and my honey adore this theater...makes movie night so much more fun...now all they need is reclining seats and hot napkins and food delivered to your seat - haha☺️
We are always greeted with a warm welcome by the owner and staff...and now they have beer and wine - woohoo!< /Review><Time>1576785076529< /Time>< gmap_id>

<Text>One of the only theatre in, I don't know how many miles around, that takes you backwards in history with days bygone. The ownership/management is so down to earth and friendly. Its clean and neat and picture and sound quality is as good as any other more modern cooperation owned conglomerate with no personality.<//Text>< pictures>

On the other hand, the concession stand was out of trays (which means no popcorn refills without coming back out as well), hot dogs, nachos, regular coke and one additional soda.

Still, it's a good place to go see a movie.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x8090959ad7a40bcb:0x798b7dcfd435aa9a< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

1st off let me say this the owner is extremely cool such a good guy hard working he does the best he can to make sure this theater is in top shape never had a bad movie experience and we have seen at least 20 movies here in the last year, yes we love movies 😀popcorn taste amazing sodas are never flat what more could you ask for easy parking on the street very quiet.  These days it's impossible to get in to a movie with all these reclinable seats bells and whistles. If you're looking for just a wonderful evening out trust me when I say this movie theater will deliver...< /review>

Owner is super friendly. He owned this place for 20 years. Apparently it was closed for 20 years prior. Previously lived in the bay area. Decided to make the move in 99. Great theater. Murals are original. Seats are great. Great selection of movies. Owner previously managed theaters all over the bay area.
Their website shows all of today's showings. Easy to use.
He also used to teach at the community college for 7 years on film history.</text>

The folks who run this place are very friendly and helpful. Pro tip: If you have small children who require a booster seat, bring your own car booster into the theatre with you, as the folding seats can be tough for small kids.</Text>

What can I say?  This is the best place to catch a movie. The sound system is very good and they use great projectors. The GM is a nice guy and will talk to you about classic movies. This is what going to the cinema is supposed to be like.<//Review>

Great theater, and super big for it's location, and age. For those of you complaining of the bathroom smell... the bathroom features 2 urinals, and a single stall. Unlike Regal Cinema, or massive theaters... the toilets are all right next to each other, and cannot be properly ventilated. So it will smell like bathroom. And the staff consists of excellently chosen, well behaved people, but they are always short staffed, and clean the best they can between showings... sometimes they miss stuff. But the place is always clean. If it isn't, don't complain on here. Or whine. Please inform the employees so they can fix it. Don't be the problem, be the solution. :D</text>

Growing up in Seattle I hung out in art house theaters quite a bit, and I really enjoy old theaters whose owners not only play great films but that respect film-making and find creative ways to instill a love of film in its patrons. The owner of Angels Theatre, Jeff, has done wonders to restore this lovely old theater. What's more, he is truly happy to share his knowledge and love of film. I love knowing that I will always feel better just for having spent a few hours there, enjoying a great movie... and they always serve up a generous helping of delicious popcorn!< /text>

Always a pleasure visiting our hometown movie theater.  Friendly staff, well-maintened theaters, reasonably-priced and first run shows.  Where else, too, can one discuss the merits of a film after seeing with someone as knowledgeable as its manager?</review>

My favorite theater ever! I refuse to go to the theater in Sonora because Angle's is so much cheaper and homier. And all of the workers are super friendly, especially the jolly register man.</Review>

Small town movie theater experience at it's best.  Theater technology is fantastic, uncrowded showings, short ticket lines, lower ticket prices, blockbuster movies and an independent film is offered most weeks.  Out of towers craving a more authentic theater experience might even want to drive up to watch a film and enjoy fine dining at Crusco's just a few doors down from the theater.< /Review>

I saw Dunkirk there, a great movie.  It's an old theater, but very adequate for a small town like Angels Camp.  Prices are less than many other theaters.<//Review>

I can't even count the number of movies I've seen there, but lately it's getting a bit rough. Before I go on, take into consideration that this is an old theater in a small town. They're not making a ton of money, and they're by far one of the cheapest movie theaters you can visit. Due to these things, the theater has become pretty musty smelling in the main lobby. Just went to see Deadpool 2 there and they had locked the front doors which made me question whether they were even open and we almost walked away so they may be losing business due to this. The screen in theater 5 where Deadpool 2 is playing had been very poorly cleaned and there very visible residue on the screen of a liquid that had dripped down to the carpet. It was a bit distracting during the movie. Also no chance of getting popcorn, drinks or snacks as there was nobody available behind the counter to serve things. Having said that, I still absolutely love this theater and will continue to visit it as long as it's still standing.<//Review>< date>

<review>LOVE this theatre!! This is the first theatre that I ever went to as a child- saw "M*A*S*H" with my folks way back when (my mom threw her sweater over my head at the juicy parts....). This is the theatre where my own family spent so many happy hours. Efficient, fun and quirky staff, comfy new seats, good sound and clarity, kitschy Gold Rush/western themed murals, good popcorn-what else could you want?!  If you want to talk about movies, the staff is always game, respectful and interested. I always check this theatre first before I'll consider going all the way to Sonora, etc. When the new Star Wars came out last year, they did the kindest thing when they pre-sold me the tix! I'll never forget that, and I'm loyal because of their customer service. Yep, the ladies bathroom stalls are retro-they are definitely NOT the gigantic space-wasting behemoths so common in every mall and theatre in America. Whatever-it's never been an issue for me or my family.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8090959ad7a40bcb:0x798b7dcfd435aa9a<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful old theater built in the 30's and later remodeled and expanded provides a fun retro experience with all the modern conveniences, including comfortable stadium seating, surround sound, and even 3D feature films. Quite the gem.<//Review>

Over all it's a pretty decent place. What it lacks in space makes up freshness and quality. Could definitely use an AC.</review>

< review>
The worst customer service ever!! One of the ladies there questioned everything I was buying and confirmed with another lady that was all I really got. When I asked her if she thought I was lying she said, “No, I just want to make sure that’s all you got.” Then ran my card and handed my receipt without saying a wolf, not a thanks for coming in not a here is your receipt.  She was the one that took my order for 4 items!!! She had a really bad attitude, I will most definitely not be back to this place! Liked the stuff I got, but it’s something I can go and buy somewhere else. I would not recommend this place at all!!!!  Wish I would give it a negative 5 starts!!< /review>

<Review>Worst bionico place ever! The place is very dirty. The people working there are very rude

I ordered a liquiado/milkshake
Horrible!
They didnt even bother to add ice! Since when do u need to ask for a liquicado/milkshake to be cold!

I also ordered tostielotes with very little mayo. The lady who made it made sure to drench it in mayo.

I asked for a bigger tray because I felt like the tostielotes where too tight. She said no that they wouldnt fit. After giving her a funny look she said here so u leave happy! Seriously?

To top it off they are pricy for the horrible service they offer!

Had to give them 1 star but they don't even earn that!

Disappointed!</Review>< pics>

I have always shopped at this paticular dollar store for years. But this time in particular I was told I couldnt purchase balloons for sale because they were bunched in a set of 3 (for graduation). I just wanted a gold star balloon they could of swapped out for a diff color star balloon for a boutique. I was also told they ran out of helium until a week from then. Just upsetting to be told by a dollar store which is advertised to sell individual items a dollar advertising items sold in bulk only. So I left my picked out balloons when it was a simlpe switch for the accommodation of being out of helium as well. Need better customer service.< /text>

Some cashiers need training. If they are almost going to close the cash register and they are with their last customer they should politely say "I'm sorry but I'm already closed" not looking down and saying "she can help you." Pointing at his co-worker Also they need to be polite when giving change to people as there was a cashier that threw the change to my mom...</text>

Went in to get balloons and the person I'm guessing was the lead or worst manager named Erica/Erika was so disrespectful. They were switching out the helium tanks (which I was willing to wait for no problem and I told her that) and she just kept telling me it would take a while and that they didnt have time for that right now before walking away. Another super nice employee asked which ones I wanted just to have them ready and Erica quickly joined the convo questioning why the was doing that to which the other cashier replied to have then ready to be blown up and reduce the wait time. When the tanks where in the nice cashier couldn't out the handle on and asked Erica for help only for her to roll her eyes and begrudgingly come help. For someone in a higher position her attitude and response was just unprofessional. Watch out if you go to this Dollar Tree the team member Erica might not even let you shop if it inconveniences her.< /text>

<review>Customer service is okay , we'll I should say it depends on the person that is helping you out .They need to smile and put aside there problems ...Sometimes you get real good service and then sometimes you just want to hurry up and get out of there .I myself.

< review>
TLDR: Excellent prices, excellent service, professional work. This is the place to go for any tire related anything, and is now my personal go-to for tires that I would recommend to everyone.

Full review:

I have been to several tire places and this one is the best of the lot without question.

I called ahead to make sure they had what I needed, as the vehicle in question has uncommon tires. There was a short wait while stock was confirmed, and was subsequently pleasantly suprised to hear the not only did they have 4 tires of the correct size, but they were able to undercut their competitions price.

There is no reduction of quality of service and work from the lower price, which is a definite win in my book. It did take longer than one might expect, but that was due to my tires being really wide as well as run-flat tires, which adds a significant degree of difficulty (have done tires myself in the past with a manual tire machine, so have a bit of experience in this area). Despite the difficulty,  the work was done with no complaints and the team of two brothers worked together very well to complete the job to perfection. They realised that the work was taking a while without me saying anything, and proceeded to explain exactly what was going on without any prompting at all, which shows their professionalism and knowledge in action.

After all was said and done, I was told to bring my car right back if there were any issues and they would take care of it. These guys rock!

2 Months Later: As happy now as on day 1; my truck needs tires soon and I know exactly who to call!

7 Months Later: Awesomely epic service, 'nuff said</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I am pretty car savy and I checked around carefully before buying tires.  I knew I could buy premium tires from Costco for about  $1000.00 with good service and nation wide warranty.  However, I have decided to buy from this local independent dealer. I bought "Lionhart" brand new,  tires were in stock and were installed and computer balanced for $350. The ride is smooth, quiet, and they look like a million bucks. I could buy 3 sets of these for the price of one set from Costco. If you are driving across country or out of state maybe you should buy from a large national company. But if you drive local you can't go wrong with this place.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>A lot of unreasonable rules. You don't need use mask for cardio but you have to use for other machines in same space. Between them couple foots. Before pandemic, they never let turn off fans, everybody had to work with wind, so cold, reason "stop seperate viruses". Now they don't let turn on fans, reason "may cause separate Covid 19". They don't have idea about viruses or sport, l couldn't understand<//Review>< Pictures>

I dont understand how my kids will learn gymnastics when the coaches just tell them to do a move once and expect them to perfect it in 4 sessions. They dont even teach on how to do the move if they are struggling they just supervise and say "good". My kids have been held back 3 times now because they cant do a cart wheel...then teach them how to do a cart wheel! Last time I sign my kids up for this program.< /Review>

We certainly don’t expect our gymnasts to learn a new skill within four practices either! We believe our gymnastics director reached out to you personally directly after this message to better explain our combined recreation classes and levels (particularly while we navigate through COVID requirements and changes), as well as to offer a complete progress report. We also understand that six months off of gymnastics for everyone means we focus on rebuilding strength, flexibility and more. One last quick thought that we employ with our recreational gymnasts: If there are a few mandatory skills that hold them back, there is opportunity for private lessons for 1-to-1 attention. With the wide range of skills and other details to focus on, often times it’s difficult to spend an extended amount of time on one skill in a group setting. We hope this information helps – and we hope your daughter may still be interested in continuing her gymnastics journey!'}</Response><rate>1</rate></record></dataset><record>

The water slide area is great. They've made a lot of renovations. It's much better. I don't care for the kids area as much because the infants are sectioned off in the same room as the bigger kids. I think they should have their own separate room.< /text>

<Review>Gym is ok, but do not come here if you need a functional locker room. They recently "renovated" it and it has regressed to the point of unusable. Lockers the size of a shoebox hold nothing. Sinks with no counter space, and no shelving in showers to hold soap or other basic items. Locker room looks pretty but is not functional in any way. If the YMCA paid even a dime for this renovation, they were ripped off. I will be driving the extra 20 minutes and going to McGrath.< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< username>

<Review>I have always enjoyed coming here. The prices were great but they recently changed the non Santee resident price to $9 a person. It's a bit much if you're just driving over from Lakeside. Otherwise the Lifeguard staff is great. The wait time was great. The pool was clean and I like that the lifeguards do rotations to ensure none of them get too sleepy and Nod off. I cannot contribute a photo because you're not allowed to take photos inside. I'm not complaining because I understand why but it would be nice to take a picture of your kids playing.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Great for kids. Equipment is ok for the average beginner to weight lifting. Sharing is big because there is only 1 squat rack. Classes are fun. Staff is kind and helpful. Strict dress code though which makes it a little uptight. I'd recommend it if you have young children. Great summer programs</review>

We went to the splash pad on Sunday sep 30.  There were many kids there and on one side were several little white blond kids and my brown son.  Every time the various kids would do something such as jump, the whistle was only blown at him.  One time the lifeguard was telling him something and the two girls did the exact same whilst he was talking with no notice.  I appreciate safety rules as we are law enforcement family but maybe apply rules to more than the brown kids.<//Text>

<text>Terrible place to take your kids swimming! Not enough chairs, pool always crowded, zombies for staff. We went and paid 24 dollars for me and my 2 kids to swim for about an 1 hour and a half before they close (for cleaning) until 3:30 and they open up again. We couldn’t even do that since they had a poop in the pool emergency and kicked us out of the pool. Did they refund my money? Nope. Swallowed those funds up and gave us guest passes, as if we want to go back there again. Avoid like the plague! McGrath YMCA near us is better.</text>< user>

< review>
2-star specifically for non-members/non-resident activity pool. Went here today for the first time with the wife, the grandparents, and two kids (2 and 4.5) for the 12:30-2:30 session. Now, once we got in we had an absolute blast, but the 2-star review is due to our awful experience before we entered the pool area (considered 1-star but wanted to factor in that we did have a fun time in the water). NON-MEMBERS: BE ADVISED. LONG LINE WAITS. Not to be dramatic, but at one point while we were waiting in line it was so bad my 4.5 year old started crying and said, "Dad, can we please just leave and go to the water front park?" (And it wasn't a typical 4-year-old bratty/whining cry. It was a genuine sad/disappointed cry.) Basically what happened was, we got there at Noon and were close to the front of the "Non-member" line, but we didn't get in to the actual pool area until 1pm, and that was only because at 12:50 (20 minutes after the the session opened) I went up to the lifeguard who was processing everyone (members) in and asked her when they were going to start to also process the non-members. She said that she was going to process all of the members first before she started the non-members (which at the rate things were going and how many members there still were in line we MAYBE would have gotten into the pool at 1:30.) So I asked her to double check with a supervisor on their policy (because if that were the case we would've left.) Thankfully she checked because when she came back they started processing the non-members as well. All that to say, it was a very stressful and very disappointing way to start off what (thankfully) ended up being a fun afternoon at the pool. And although it ended up being fun, unless they change their process or non-member/resident price, I don't plan on going back. It's just not worth it for price, wait in line, and limited time alowed inside. I get that members/residents have priority, but still..it doesn't need to be this bad. (Maybe process people who are in line early and have a separate staging area where people who are already processed can wait and then go right in when the session starts?) Last comment...I feel like most of the disappointment could've been avoided if they communicated better and put on their website "non-member spots limited. Arrive early. Expect long waits. Cost is for one 2-hour session only" Unless I missed it, nowhere did the website communicate any of that. Please let me know if you improve the non-member check in process! Would love to come back if you do!<//review>

The kiddie pool was closed due to an accident and I was a little upset because I had just called a couple hours before arriving, but the staff was really kind and accommodating. I was babysitting and we really enjoyed the lap pool. I was even able to teach him how to swim! I can't wait to become a member!</Text>

<Review>I used to love their water aerobics program.  But it has become very crowded and the instructors do not show us seniors how to modify the exercises.  For years I went to the Mission Beach Plunge for water aerobics and the instructors were very knowledgeable and understood that exercising in the water is a slower pace than doing the exercises on the deck of the pool.  Plus, they synced the music with the exercises.  This group of instructors seem to be someone they pulled in off the street that needed a job with little to no experience.  Sad that this is not the program it once was.< /Review><UserId.>108104731072019332231< /UserId.>< response>

Cameron Family YMCA is a great option for a health club. It has a pool, a work out room, a cardio area, and a gymnastics floor. They offer classes from mild to wild. I love doing cardio on the machines here. All my kids learned to swim here.< /Text>

While members AND non members are going through the member line and getting in. My 7 month old daughter and I are waiting in a line that isn't moving for 20+ minutes after opening in the sun. We came here to cool off.i got here early. Also school busses are showing up and getting in the member line. Every time the member line is done, more members show up and walk right in.

Imma give the pool area a 3 starts because I just think there is too much rules: no jumping, no splashing, No phones near the pool, etc. When kids go to the pool they enjoy get wet by jumping in or splashing so that is just to muck rules like splashing in the pool won’t kill anyone.< /Text>

The gym is small, dark and outdated... apparently there's a dress code too. We were told mid drifts were to be covered, which it was, but you could see the sides of my waist and there was a partial opening on the back of my shirt..again mid drift was not showing but was told shirt was not allowed .<//Text>

Every time I am there , I get 5 difference information about one course/class/. And when you call , you are on hold on average of 15minutes.

Very Disappointing. The amount of money they ask for service is not justified.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Worst location I asked for a swim refund about two weeks prior to swim classes and I called to check the status of my refund and I have different people telling me about my refund process about me having to take my kids back to fill up the same refund and that I will received my refund which has been expedited. this location has wasted my time just trying to get a refund for classes my son will not be attending at this location< /Text>

I only gave it 1 star because that's the only way I could give my opinion.
I personally go to another location, but my daughter loves the pool slides here. I thought it was ok but noticed every time I came here something bad would happen. THIEF IS A BIG PROBLEM HERE. And the staff is a joke. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE WHO VALUES FAMILY VALUES. I saw a teenager out front waiting to get into the pool area playing with a butterfly knife ( which is illegal ) showing a kid who looked about nine how to open and close the knife and the joke is staff was there and said nothing. I'll never go back to this trash dumpster place ever again. ZERO STARS< /text>

Customer service is just a joke. The workout area was okay before remodeling. After they remodeled it, they turned it into garbage. Has a pool, but for no use because it is always reserved for their programs.</text>

I'm only giving 1 star for this reason....
It was our first time swimming here and I let the girl who checked us in know that. However, she never informed me that there were timed sessions and everyone must exit and pay again to re-enter.
My kids live in Santee but I live in San Diego so I had to pay non resident price of $16 for the 2 of them (otherwise it should have been $3 each).... 45 minutes after being there, (at about 1:10pm) they find a turd in the children's pool. The whole staff comes running out screaming "the pool is closed" so everyone starts leaving. They said the pool would re-open at 2pm and that we needed to exit and wait in line to get back in and pay ANOTHER $16!!!!
Needless to say we won't be returning to the YMCA<//review>

{'time': 1499793794831, 'text': "Hi Frank, we’re so sorry to hear your pool time was cut short! We understand how frustrating this can be especially when you are entertaining your children and trying to beat the heat. As you can imagine, the YMCA follows very strict health and safety standards and we have to close the pool when there is a fecal accident. When this occurs, our lifeguards and member services staff hand out guest passes to our community participants for them to return on a different day to participate in an open swim session. It sounds like we missed you! Feel free to contact Susan Alvarez at 619-449-9622 and she’d be happy to make arrangements to secure a guest pass. Our pool is in popular demand during the summer months so we have four sessions offered Monday-Saturday and three sessions available on Sundays. Our goal is to accommodate as many people as possible during the hot summer months. Please visit our website to see our pool schedule: http://www.ymca.org/eastcounty. We hope you'll give us another try :)."}</resp>

We recognize this is inconvenient for many of our members and the community-at-large. However, the proactive measures we’re taking are vital to not only better your member experience, but also for safety. We're pretty confident this overhaul will put an end to those ongoing issues you reference :). Thank you for your continued patience!

< review>
Outfits for all occasions! And I say outfits because they do not just sell clothes. Their store is beautifully organized so that you can buy 3 or 4 or 10 if you have a problem like me.... matching pieces to dress up or down to make several unique outfits! I just love this place and their style for the woman on the go.<//review>

I purchase 75% of my work clothes from this company and their online prices are exceptionally better than in store. I do my best to stay out of this store and mostly go there to return items purchased online when it's to much of a hassle to ship them back. The older woman who manages this store is the definition of rude and lifeless. She does not acknowledge customers, she does not ever smile or give off a welcoming demeanor, and she always has a very dry, condescending tone when she speaks. She is not a good face for the company and that is based on her attitude alone. The other sales associates in the store are great but with the manager they have I am affraid that wont last long.<//text>

Only buy something if you are certain I mean absolutely certain you want it

I have tried 3 times to return items
The first time was oh you need a receipt after I thought they could use my card to find my purchase
The second time because I didn’t have my receipt I figured oh I will use my cc bill only to be told that won’t work
Finally I brought in a receipt now they said I’m too late
What the hell I have  been trying to return these items for weeks!!

This is utterly ridiculous I will never come back to this store or recommend them the customer service is terrible
What an inconvenience not to mention today is day 44 of a said 45 day policy<//Text>

Absolutely love their clothing but, can't handle their prices.  Every once in a while I splurge.< /Text>

<text>if I can give 0 starts I would
I had just bought some shorts I didn't have time to try them on, so when I went home and did they didn't fit right so I went the next morning to return or exchange them and they did not let me they were so rude, just because they were on the sale rack , I  work in retail so I know I can at least exchange them specially if it's not even 24hrs of buying them , they never cared to explain no return policy on sale items when I purchased them nor it says it on the receipt
All my clothes is from here and I guess I'm not shopping here again< /text>< user_id>

< Review>
Where do I start? I came in for an oil change and was assigned by Giovanni. He made sure I got my oil change then he went over what I needed done to my car. I didn’t feel pressured into doing business with then. All story short I’m pleased with the professionalism of this establishment. I recommend.</Review>

<Review>I received fast and excellent service from Jovanni the both times i went in for service on my car.... He was very tentative to my concerns with my car repairs and maintenance! He was very courteous and helpful and always had a smile.... good service and good price!
I will definitely go back when car needs repair or maintenance<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Integrity Tire Goodyear is definetly the best in the business. Chris and Omar stand firmly behind what they promote, they go far and beyond to make customers happy.

I was recommended here and I got to witness myself all the good things I heard from this business.

Great deals and great service!</Text>< Pics>

Oil change was done quickly and at a fantastic Groupon price. My service provider, Jason, didnt try and upsell a bunch of stuff but he did point out to me a few things I might wish to address, like tires, and offered me a very good price on replacement.</Review>

< Review>
When in for alignment and to what was wrong with a/c . They charge me $99 to run a diagnostic. They call me back about an hour and half later. They told me I needed to replace a/c compressor and expansion valve. Total for that job was $1200. Decide not to proceed was out of my budget.  So a/c been running fine. I took it to a different shop but was going to get charge to find the problem the technician told me that a/c compressor was working fine. Be careful with what they try selling you!<//Review>

<Review>At Integrity Tire (Goodyear) neither counter people have on masks. In addition two clients came in without masks and were served without question. No wonder San Bernardino County COVID19 new cases are rising. I asked if they had a mask policy he said “no”.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Came in for check engine light I paid $125. So they could tell me the problem to my car. Their technician said it was the O2 sensors along with mass air flow sensor. They couldn't tell me the specific codes for my "faulty" O2 sensors and mass air flow sensor. And Ryan  front desk man said as long as I don't get the work done there I'm going to keep having problems. Turns out it was bad catalytic converter. Had to take the car to another shop to get a second opinion. This place is garbage. Go to Ralph's Mufflers in Fontana they check my car for free of charge!</Text>< date>

<text>Ok for tires but I wouldn't do any other services as they're overpriced ($125/hr labor) Pay attention to your total breakdown. I was quoted $282 for 2 tires out the door but paid $260 because I opted out of the nitrogen fill. Clerks didn't ask if I'd prefer nitrogen or regular air.</text>< Pictures>

So I stopped here to get my wheels balanced because I noticed a slight shaking. After about 20 minutes, the front desk employee gestured for me to follow him to my vehicle (which was still parked in the bay). He told me I needed new shocks WITHOUT showing me any thing on my car. With my vehicle on the ground, he said the shocks should be placed every 70,000 or so miles and said it would cost me $1200 (he simply showed me a piece of paper), without showing me any car parts or worn parts or anything. I told him no thanks on the $1200 repair. Long story short, they did complete the wheel balancing and the vehicle shaking went away & my car drove very smooth. I'm still a bit concerned that the employee was trying to talk me into a obvious unnecessary repair. I would recommend getting a 2nd opinion if these guys try and upsell you on expensive repairs.</review>

<Text>I just wanna say yes the Manager is cool, but he's not so good at taking care of my complaints or worries. Why did I have to wait 3 hours for my car when it needed a wheel alignment and my tires looked at because of the brake noise. My car was aligned about 4 times. Not sure why they thought 4 alignments would fix my problem. But it surely didn't. Nor did you guys help me out with my brake problem that you guys keep overseeing, acting as if I'm lying. Now I'm sitting in debt simply because I refuse to pay for what you NEVER FIXED ON MY CAR. Simple.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

There integrity lives up to their company name. I do recommend for San Bernardino Tire shoppers to give them the opportunity to show you their integrity of service to you.
My second visit now due to a nail and thankfully he recommended what would save my life. Thank you because cost is not worth a life</Review>< Pics>

DO NOT USE THIS PLACE! They are ripoff artists. I went in for a tune up and oil change, they ended up charging me $1800 and less than 2 days later I have two belts break down that should have been serviced while I was there. They do not do even the basic work correctly.<//text>

<text>Took it for a quick tire repair and they did a "courtesy check". Couple days later radiator starts acting up. Opened the hood and the line from the reservoir had been cut and the fluid was nearly gone. Fixed the line and refilled the radiator  and was good to go. Brought the car back in for an oil change two weeks after the tire repair. Guy opens the hood and immediately tells me I need a new radiator, water pump, temp sensor all for around 800 bucks. I tell him what I found after opening the hood and he just says I don't know what I'm talking about and I cannot drive this car home. Dude tried to push me onto a credit card and was very rude about me not wanting to change the radiator saying stuff like you'll never make it home. I've been commuting 45 miles everyday for two weeks and have had no issues. Did they cut my line? Maybe. Hard to prove. The coincidence and bully like behavior is enough for me to never go back.< /text><time>1550697812940<//time><user>107362212726220981705< /user><user_name>D Castnick (DC)<//user_name><GmapID>0x80c35366050f5043:0xdca18712c37755b3<//GmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

<review>Absolutely OUTSTANDING service. Been going here for 3 years and I come back every time.  Saul and Omar are the most honest mechanic reps I have come in contact with. They do not recommend what is not needed. Their prices are pretty great, too. Friendly atmosphere and their warranties are A+!! No hassles, no BS, and fast service. Don't go anywhere else.

I had a great experience. I received wonderful customer service from both Brian and Omar! I was able to purchase tires for one of my vehicles, and get an oil change/wheel alignment for my truck in less than 2 hours with no appointment. I would HIGHLY recommend integrity tires/ Goodyear to all! Thanks guys for your professionalism and great service.</Text>

Had a Groupon, so tried it. Got there and was told it would be almost 2 hours. Since it was going to expire and I had driven a bit of distance, I decided to go ahead and wait. Next thing I know, about 15 minutes later, he comes to tell me all good with car (he had someone get on it quickly) but a concern about a couple of my tires that need attention. It is still up, so they show me the tires and yes they need replacing. Felt like I was treated very fairly and would recommend.< /Review>

Integrity never lets me down, and my latest visit was no exception. They were able to immediately diagnose my car's problem, make the repairs, and have my vehicle back to me the same day. The staff is always friendly and courteous, too.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Took my Honda in to get front end aligned. While there I was shown the wear on my tires.(yes of course that's what they do $) But the reality is just that. I've lived in SB for many years and been to several tire shops but never received a better price on 4 new tires with all the warranty/guarantees etc... And the employees there were quick and courteous.

Ryan was very pleasant and friendly on the phone when I inquired about an oil change and how long of a wait time it would be. I drove my car right over and was taken care quickly and my car was checked in to be look over. I did let Ryan know that I was going to be driving out of state. He found other things that needed some care. He was able to have my car service with his team of mechanics. I was very pleased with their hard work today in the heat! What a difference I felt when driving home!</Review>

Quick and courteous service without trying to sell me services I didn’t ask for or didn’t need (are you listening Jiffy Lube?). There were a number of other customers ahead of me but the manager there (Ryan) had me out in a reasonable amount time! Will be back for more service!<//Text>

<Review>I took my vehicle on 10/22/16  following an accident that required some internal repairs. I was charged $1,371 to fix everything. They called me a week later told me the vehicle was completed and ready to go. I then returned on 11/05 because my car was making a really bad noise. They told me my car needed a new front disk brake rotor, I was very confused as to why they didn't find it the first time but I was in desperate need of my car so I paid an additional $198. I figured after this repair my car would be all set! I picked up my car a few days later and once again the noise returned. I returned back & was told my car NOW needed new hub bearings and that it would cost and additional $500. After this, I knew I was being conned! I picked up my vehicle and took it down to two different mechanics with my receipts in hand and told them to inspect my vehicle. I received a call with BAD news! INTEGRITY TIRE was lying to me and charged me for things that did not need to be fixed! My hub bearings were perfectly fine and to top it off the repairs were poorly done. The mechanic's left bolts loose/broken, Trust mount was broken still, Rotor groove still damaged among other things. I filed a report with the Bureau of auto repair recommended by the mechanics who said they would testify for me if need be. I got in contact with the Integrity Tire in Moreno valley and they told me they would be more than happy to fix my cars issues. I was told over the phone they would take care of me and even give me a rental for the time being. Let me be clear it was already December and I was already dealing with this issue for two months! I drove all the was to Moreno valley integrity Tire on 12/02. They expected my vehicle and I kept on asking for the rental that they promised and they lied to me! I stayed at the location for 8 freaking hours!!! They said they fixed everything and admitted that there was in fact nothing wrong with the hub bearings! After getting back in touch with the bureau of automotive I was told they were investigating Integrity tire for wrong doings. Integrity tire was later found to be in violation of many things after I reported them!  I have been dealing with their messy service since October! I am taking them to small claims court because of my time that was wasted and my inability to do my day to day activities such as attend school! After all this stress I have encountered with this company I do not want anyone else to get conned by them! They are refusing to reimburse me the money I deserve back DO NOT GO TO INTEGRITY TIRE!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Peter was awesome. They not only helped me with my Groupon oil change,  They showed me that the brakes were 95% worn down on the back and less than 50% on the front and then my back shocks had to be replaced showed me The difference between good ones and bad ones. They have 90 days same as cash to pay off the bill. They were super helpful and had me done and on my way<//review>

Fast and friendly. I had a flat and thankfully I was only across the street. Ryan got me in quickly, and everyone was suusu nice, even though I showed up like 20 minutes before they closed. They took care of me, got a decent deal, and had me in my car within 45 minutes.< /Text>

<Review>Called Integrity and spoke to Omar who I've dealt with in past. He gave me a fast quote on some tires which was pretty reasonable so I came in and he took care of my vehicle. He had Emilio call me to let me know another situation came up and we were good with it. I find this shop very knowledgeable and great customer service was given to me. Thank you Omar and Emilio!!☺<//Review>< pictures>

I got the best deal in the whole world at this place on Black Friday! Everyone was very professional and easy to talk to. The only problem was the wait but it was Black Friday and I also saved a ton of money so the time is not really important but everything else was done smoothly and next time I buy a car it will probably be a Toyota from Moss Brothers Toyota in Moreno Valley lol Thanks guys!< /text>

Bought the 3 oil and services for &25.00, when I went in they told me it was $37.00 because I needed synthetic oil. When I bought the package they never mentioned that!! They said it would be $3.00 for oil disposal fee!!

Then the heat was broke in the building so it was 39 degrees outside and 39 degrees inside. I had to stand outside to wait in the sun!! That is NOT right, the business should not have even been open with no heat in the middle of winter!!

Then they told me that I needed new rear tires that they were cracked and they could extend a great deal for me! I said NO! I went to a tire shop after my service and they said my tires are fine! This place is a joke!!!!< /review>

Pulled in today feb 24/2019 with my water hose leaking water and asked the foreman if he could replace the clip at the end of the hose for me.  I opened the hood and specifically showed it to him what I wanted to be done.  They walked back in the office and told me I was gonna be charged $59 to diagnose it.  So they proceed in charging me $94 for labor $89.99 for coolant flush and $45 for the clip that costs $12 at the auto part store next door. Said I didn’t want to pay all that money to just replace a clip that took 15 minutes to be replaced at V&L auto repair on baseline, I said I didn’t wanted to pay for the diagnosis because I clearly explained to them what I wanted done.  The threatened to write my license and turn me in to the police so I said to go ahead and call the police while I was there to explain what happened so they canceled the invoice (on the photo attached) and let me go. The repair at the V$L auto repair cost me $60 including the clip, labor and 2 gallons of coolant. I will never go back to this shop. Good luck if you don’t know about car repair.<//Text>

They have very good mechanics.  I have brought my car and truck here for alignment.  Got new tires for my car and they did a new rack and pinion on the car. Car rides great. Truck they put new steering box and now the truck steers the way it should. It is a little expensive but you pay for quality work and they won't do you wrong.</Review>

The crew at Integrity were professional and efficient.  Ryan made us aware of some discounts that were beneficial to us.  Shane showed us some issues that needed to be addressed in the near future. Shane also repaired some wiring so that we could drive home safely.  They made an unpleasant situation (blowing a tire) bearable.<//Review>

I went in to replace one tire and ended up with all four new tires. This place has good prices and great people. The service was awesome and the time it took was fast. I’ll be coming back for future repairs or needs.< /text>

I was at Goodyear Integrity Tire a few days ago. Omar took care of all my concerns. I was treated with respect and courtesy.  I appreciate talking to Chris, as he made it possible for me to share my concerns and a positive outlook for my future business with Goodyear. I've been a custome for 20+ years. Thank you Chris and Omar for great service!<//text>

<Review>Service was great. Omar explained every aspect of the work request and protection plan in detail. I brought two vehicles in and they took care of both very efficiently. They even pointed out a couple of issues that need to be taken care of on one of the vahicles and offered a free estimate. Overall very satisfied with the service.</Review>< Gmap_id>

This place is cool. I don't feel like they try to get over on you. I know cars and the problems they pointed out we not BS. They were things that honestly did need repairing. Yes you pay for labor, but get over it or learn to do it yourself. I've brought my cars to them for years. Good people</review>

I’m new to the Colton area and needed a mechanic when my truck got a flat. I’m glad I went with Integrity Tire. I was initially greeted by one of the mechanics who pointed me in the direction of the office where Pete handled the paperwork. He was polite, knowledgeable and sharp.
I was called back to the shop about a half hour later with news of a leaking transmission line. Rich took me back with a flashlight so I could see the undercarriage to ensure what I was paying for. I clearly saw that it had been leaking and didn’t expect any foul play. I asked him if he had any suggestions regarding my 2010 Chevy Silverado work truck that I had just bought with 30,000 miles on it; he mentioned a fuel injection service which I agreed to. All in all, I left feeling confident that Pete and Rich took great care of my truck!< /review>

They sold me on adding the lifetime nitrogen for they tires @ $50. Never put the nitrogen in. At checkout the tried to charge me for. I had to bring it tp their attention and prove it wasn't in before they would remove the charges. Could be a simple mistake not sure. Just a heads up.< /Text>

Bought a 3 year alignment policy , every time  ide take my car for a alignment which was about 5-6 months they would question me why am I bringing it in, and make it seem like I shouldn’t be bringing it in . They also stored my policy and vehicle under another persons account practically told me I’ve never been there , then I made a big deal and found the issue. And lastly I changed my suspension on my vehicle and dude straight up said that voided my policy “ I can show you where it says that on the back of the paper” . This place is straight garbage , NEVER will I consider business “Integrity” again. (They’re constantly trying to sell stuff for your vehicle that you don’t need )<//text>

Luis took the time to give me Tires 101 as he called it.  Thursday afternoons are best when they aren't too busy. Their No Cash, No Credit financing shocked me.

I had a  blow out coming down highway 18....Needed a front tire . Omar helped me and because of his positive attitude and sincere compassion, I chose to purchase all 4 new tires. Omar was very polite and kind, so for that reason I WILL BECOME A RETURN CUSTOMER!!! Thank you Integrity Tire.<//Text>

<Review>I bought a Groupon for 45.00 for a full synthetic oil Change. When I get there the guy was not friendly. Then told me my Groupon only covers 5 quarts of oil and I need 6. But tried to charge me for 2 told me I had pay 10.00 out of pocket. It isn't the principal of paying 10.00 it was the fact no where on my Groupon did it state only good for 5 quarts. Then if I only needed 6 why charge me for two more? His attitude was he hates his job anyway and I choose to leave. Customer service sucks.</Review></record>

<review>The service was great. Armando was my Service Representative on Saturday, February 3, 2018.. He was honest and very patient. I really enjoyed doing service with Armando and Goodyear. He treated me like I was a queen for a day. I called Armando today, Monday, February 5th, to ask him a question about my car. He was happy to hear from me and seemed to answer my question with a smile over the telephone. Good service. I truly recommend Goodyear and I will return for all vechicle repairs. Armando truly deserves a raise and a promotion.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I went there today after first going to Sears and being told they were out of oil so I  took ny wife's advice and went to Integrity tires since it's close to home. I was told it would be 2-3 hours  I went back after 3 hours and they hadn't started on my car. They appeared to be rather busy. I went back home and i was called to come back and get the car after half hour.. The manager Peter said that I would not be charged because I was patience and had to wait longer than I was told. Peter apologized and insisted I would not be charged.  I told him it was ok that I would pay but he insisted I not be charged. Anyway that was great customer service and I do believe I will go back there.< /Text>

I took my truck for an alignment and they they asked me to pay the extra so I can take it in whenever I needed to take it to get aligned with no problem. Well I went Saturday 4/6/19 and they said for me to bring it back by n Sunday 4/7/19 because it was too busy, so I did and the guy at the counter was like what do you need and I said an alignment and he says it will be $89. Ok after I told him that I had already paid his whole attitude changed and according to him he couldn’t do today again. Like seriously what is the point of paying extra if you’re not going to do the alignment when I take it in. This was very disappointing and BAD customer service on their behalf.<//text>

<Text>the staff was nice enough, however, the service is the same issue i had last spring, of ‘17 i tell them my car’s pulling to one direction and the “fix” it by having it pull the other way. when i turn, i do feel the difference but now my car has a severe pull to the right. i would have went back but 1) i was in a rush to get to work and 2) this is the second time, so i’m not quite confident they could truly fix my alignment. maybe i’m missing something, as i don’t know everything about cars, but they never mentioned anything so i’m left to assume everything should work when i leave their establishment.< /Text>< rating>

SATISFIED! How does a person give enough credit, for such a great job! Intregrity has been my first recommendation for 3 of my pass cars and they always did there best, and know there Nissans! I left today happy then when i went in. There good with customer faces, and let your loyalty be recognized when possible. I always return with every car i had, and i more then appreciate there great service, and will return again and again for any of my vehicals! "ME AND MY FAMILY LOVE AND THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL YOU DONE SINCE OUR FIRST VISIT!". And Thanks for removing those horrible mounts today!</text>

I barely made it down to the shop. I was riding on a flat donut and almost flat tire. I came in kind of late in the day. They were an hour til closing on a saturday. They were real busy. They stayed after closing to make sure my car was safe to drive, I bought 4 new tires and the life time balance, rotation and ailment. They were very polite and very helpful. This is my new go to place.<//Text>

<text>I bought the oil  change package that included free tire rotation,  and topping off all fluids.  Problem is, evidence points to the possibility that Nothing i had paid for was Actually done!  The SALESMAN was the Only one who Obviously did his job... tried his damndest to turn a $30 oil change into $2500, no joke.  When I inquired about the fluid levels, he said they dont add fluids if there are signs that anything is leaking or is otherwise out of the norm... which i can tell you now that they weren’t even checked, given his response.  When i made it home i asked my wife which tire it was that was wearing thin(only one), come to find out that same tire hadnt moved... i guess they dont rotate tires now if there are signs of uneven wear huh...

So No Tires Rotated(even though the invoice says they were)...
No Fluids Topped Off...
And a Hard Over-exxagerated Push to convince me that i needed to spend $2500 before i drove my car home(at my imminent peril)...
But did they Actually change my oil??< /text>< Gmap_id>

Bought my tires here, asked for the best performance tire they have. The tires were alright. Toyos. But I wasn't too happy with them, since after 100 mph, it just didn't feel right. I called back and spoke with Luis I believe. He told me I need a Z rated tire to go above 100... little did he know I got the V rated tires which are rated for 149mph... obviously their staff doesn't know their tire rating very well... which is a really simple thing to know. Not buying tires from them again, but the $190 life time alignment is awesome</Review>

I went for an alignment and to check my tire for a nail. Took 3 hours of me sitting and waiting for it to be done. When they finished I waited 30 mins more because they forgot to check for nails. They did found a nail and patched. When I drove home the van didn't feel any different and the van was still pulling to the left. I was done waiting and had things to do or else I would've been back to fix. Not a happy customer.< /Review>

<text>I came in here after a terrible accident and needed rims, it was sunday and they had no rims. Shane redirected me to a place where I could find rims on a Sunday and I was able to get my car moving again.

Unfortunately  my car could not drive past 20, I came back to the shop On Monday and Omar had shane lift the car up and inspect the vehicle for me. The control arm was twisted, the strut qas bent and they fixed it all up for me. Shane is the best tech I've seen and Omar was phenomenal to talk to during the process.< /text><userid>113996218432601620908</userid></record></dataset><record>

They are ok. They need to stop practicing deceiving selling practices to customers. I understand they are trying to build a better customer base but they need to be considerate of people who do not have money to pay for outragegous prices and then putting it on their goodyear and synchrony car care credit cards. Its just not good business. They need to stop worrying about their reputation and just provide good service and not rip people off just because they have a goodyear credit card.< /Review>

In less than 2 hours after sending the above review with 2 stars, I was contacted by their main office with an apology and was told they owe me money. I wa leaving town, but when I returned, I went back to the store and received a refund for the Groupon coast difference.   THAT is EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!

UPDATE: So Steve Moll from corporate got into contact with me and did his best to make ammends for this debacle.  Thank you Steve for doing so and scavenging my opinion of Integrity Tire and I apreciate your efforts to make this situation better.

Came in with a flat tire, one of the mechanics had somehow managed to shove my $100 bike lock key into the ignition and get it stuck,  Tried to convince me that I was the one who did it.  After finally getting the key out, and damaging it beyond use, the manager told me that that he couldn't get the parts that day as it was a Saturday, and that he would contact me the following Monday... I'm still waiting pal.  So new tire and installation: $92.00, new Kryptonite u-lock: $76.00 (cheapest), new ignition AND door AND trunk tumblr (so they all use the same key): $90.00 for a total of $258.00.  Tire and installation is perfectly fine,  lack of professionalism and accountability is not!< /review>

They take forever its first come first serve, and they hit you with the extra expenses once your car is done so you have to pay even if you have warranty!!! Paid 40$ to get my tired fixee and installed that I had warranty on.</review>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>I came hear for my 06 honda accord  I purchased recently to get 2 goodyear assurance tires installed on the front and for an alignment.
Pros: The people here do their job correctly, and in a somewhat timely manner
Cons: The price for service is pretty high, and the guy working the desk was a little rude. He also "ran a carfax" in my car, and informed me that my Accord has over 200,000 miles on it, even though the odometer reads 87,000 and offered to "take a look at it" for me, which I obviously declined. I ended up running a few carfaxes on it from multiple companies and the car came back clean on all of them. So he either misread the results, or intentionally misinformed me to milk more service. All in all, I was charged nearly $400 (each tire cost $70, and I only purchased 2). If you price is no issue then this is definitely a decent place to have your car worked on. However, I won't be coming back here. Unless I become a millionaire< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>I went in April to check my a.c. cause it seemed it had a electrical problem cause it didn't turn on, paid the diagnosis $125... they said it was blower motor and motor resistor total for that was going to be 709.82 with diagnosis fee. Turn out to be only the motor blower resistor ONLY, I paid $50 for the part... just double check people specially when u on a budget.< /text>< Pictures>

Everything was fine until the guy wanted to almost force me to do the repairs my car needed, I get that he wanted to convince me, but he needs to know when to back off, I left the place pissed off, won’t be coming back.<//Text>

Was quoted an 1.5hr wait for an oil change, actual time was only 50 minutes...they under promised and over delivered. Can't argue with that!!!< /review>
