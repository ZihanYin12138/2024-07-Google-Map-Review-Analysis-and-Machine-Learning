My friend referred me to this dentist for my mom. She  said the doctor is amazing. My mom and I have the worse luck with dentist. I want to say this was the best dentist ever! My mom said they were so gentle on her gums during the x-ray and teeth cleaning. She enjoyed every moment. The price is reasonable. Though, I feel bad for having a crying baby there. I do not have a babysitter but I was happy they were understanding and they even tried to cheer him up. He is scared of doctor offices. I will be making an appointment for myself and hopefully when his teeth decide to come out. (Just not anytime soon)<//Text>

< review>
Thank you to those at Pipkin dental. I have major panic attacks and fear of the dentist. When I had my first appointment with Pipkin I did tell them this. They were so understanding and helpful. I had to have an exam, cleaning and a filling replaced. It was not easy but the professionals here really made me feel comfortable and had patience with me. I will be going back for sure. Thank you so much!</review>

This is the best dental service I have ever had. I can’t wait to get my plate. They treated me great and were concerned about me and how I was doing. I have never before been measured for my plate. And they do both at the same time so they fit perfectly<//Review>

<Text>Due to my previous dental experiences, I’ve been in fear of a return to the dentist. After my first visit to Pipkin Dental, I realize it’s not just what you know, it’s who you know.

Compared to every visit I’ve had in over 60 years, my experience with Pipkin Dental was more like being abducted by aliens with an advanced  extraterrestrial technology. Dr Pipkins office personnel is totally in sync with each other. The assistants and office personnel conduct themselves at a high professional level.

I had a pain free root canal, I didn’t experience pain or swelling during or after the surgery. I didn’t even take any pain medication.
I highly recommend them< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Very sanitary and everyone was friendly. I was attended by the owner, herself, Dr Pipkin. She’s very empathetic, knowledgeable and sweet.  Her assistant, Kimberly and the office manager Jane, were also very accommodating. Highly recommended.< /text>

2 stars and they both go to Miriam, I’d give her 11 if I could, she is the best. She actually cares and is considerate of nervous mothers. Medical exemption beware, they ask what your medical exemption is, which is a HIPPA violation, tyrannical and discriminatory. Jane brought the other nurses from the back to laugh at me fighting for my freedoms. Go to Apple Valley Dental, they support freedom. Been coming here for a long time and now ( I )personally won't be back. Not to mention the doctor (not Miriam) was sitting at the front with no mask. Hypocrisy.< /review>

<review>My partner and I came to Dr. Pipkin since she was recommended by a co-worker. Dr. Pipkin and her staff over exceeded my expectations for their professionalism, courtesy, and customer service.
Dr.Pipkin is an awesome, funny, and friendly person. She thoroughly explained and addressed all the questions that I had. I've never had an experience where the doctor and office staff (thank you Mica!) really took the time to fully go over the treatment plan and addressed my concerns and questions without booking other appointments or rushing me out the door.

The front office staff really focus on getting you in and out, especially during this COVID pandemic;  they are following all guidelines to make you feel safe and comfortable while visiting the office.

I highly recommend Dr.Pipkin Dental to all my friends and family. I'm glad that I've found you guys. Thank you for taking care of my partner and me.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

They were able to get me in on my timeline due to some caregiving duties which really limit my availability.  Can't say enough good things!<//Review>

<text>Dr. Pipkins chairside manner is unlike any other dentist. Gives an honest and detailed explanation of treatment.  She is respectful and actually listens. Makes you feel comfortable even if you have a sh!+ mouth with a cr@$ attitude. Careful and concise with a light handed touch, there's no comparison when it comes to Dentistry. Her patients are loyal for life and that speaks volumes.<//text>< pictures>

The most caring staff. I have been a patient for over ten years. Consistently from Dr. Pipkin to each staff member I have encountered they have provided education along with recommendations in a compassionate manner. When emergencies have occurred prompt thorough care has been provided.</text>

I have been looking for a dentist for awhile and I found this one in a book ad. I don’t care that it’s a 30 minute drive, I’m very happy that I checked this one out. They are all friendly and they care about how you feel. They want you to feel comfortable in every way.
I have really bad anxiety when it comes to dentist because of the experiences I’ve had.
I highly recommend going and seeing these friendly people.</text>

Had a wonderful experience,  I was scared but the professional staff put me at ease , from sabrina who was was so kind and professional and made me feel so relaxed ,to Dr Enriquez who did a absolutely amazing job with my dental emergency.  My crown came out perfect thanks to candys hard work through lunch. I couldn't beleive they all made such a painful procedure absolutely painless.  Thank you. Will recomend to all my freinds and family.< /review>

< review>
Always terrified of dentists after many bad experiences through my life, I had a tooth break Monday night, Tuesday morning they took x-rays and did a cleaning, yesterday (Thursday) dr Pipkin pulled that tooth as it was no longer saveable. I didn't even feel the shot. I've never had such a gentle dental experience in my entire life, the staff are nice, the Drs are very blunt when they tell you what's going on because they care, and dr Pipkin is super super gentle, really amazing at giving painless shots, got the broken tooth out quickly, and sent me on my way! Today (Friday) my jaw is sore but it's not horrible, it actually already feels like a relief that tooth is gone. Fabulous dentist!<//review>

Oh my goodness! I usually don't take time to complete reviews. But just yesterday I had an implant done and I have had ABSOLUTELY NO pain!!! Dr. Pipkin is so good, I didn't even feel the shots or the sting when she went to numb the area. She localized the numbing so well, that the whole side of my face and nose never got numb and I was so thankful because I hate that feeling. Thru the night and this morning, I have felt no pain. It is just amazing! She is sensitive, precise and a perfectionist in all she does! I appreciate that and think everyone in the desert should choose her as their dentist. This comment is a miracle because I can truly say I don't like going to the dentist. It gives me anxiety for days... but she definitely has my trust. I appreciate her and her great staff that makes my comfort and ease their priority. The front office staff is phenomenal and always willing to help and willing to do whatever it takes to help with insurance approvals, etc. The whole office staff is awesome, friendly and caring. I highly recommend this office for all of your dental needs.< /text>

My 4 year old son had been in pain. They weren't very flexible with running a few minutes behind they couldn't wait to charge you and make another appointment. The one time he had work done it took an hour to do routine work. They had problems with "insurance" approving things so they needed to make more appointments for him to be seen. (Just for the money) I was also not allowed to be back with him. I took him to a new dentist and they only cared about helping him get out of pain and only wanted him to have to go through being in the chair one time. They did ALL the work in 30 mins and I was able to stand next to him the whole time it was an awesome experience for my son and I am happy I found someone but I will never go back to Pipkin Dental again.<//text>

Dr. Pipkin is an amazing Doctor. She treated my 5 year old for a baby root canal and he did better than I expected. Since the moment he left the chair from the dentist, it was as if nothing had happened. I truly recommend Dr. Pipkin. She is great with kids and Adults!< /Text>

I recently went and had my teeth cleaned by the most sweetest hygienist (Taylor) ever! Not only did she do a great job, but she was very friendly and professional! I would highly recommend anyone to go see her. The Dentist, Dr. Pipkin is amazing! She is a very honest and a caring individual that cares about her patients well being! The assistants and the other Dr (Dr Enriquez) are very accommodating and let’s not forget about the front office staff (Jane, Mica and Sandy) were very welcoming and very helpful!</Text>

<text>I had an excellent experience at Pipkin Dental. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I was able to get an appointment as a new patient on short notice.
The waiting room was lacking. However, once I entered the patient care area all was excellent. It was up to date, clean & comfortable.  I had a full set of x-rays. A thorough exam. Everything was explained to me including fees, which were inline with what I expected. The doctor prepared my tooth for a same-day crown. While I waited for that to be made, I had a detailed cleaning by Dr. Pipkin herself. Her dental hygienist then polished my teeth. By the time my cleaning was done the crown was ready and Dr. Pipkin fitted/cemented a permanent crown. 🦷It turned out beautifulI. I was very anxious when I first arrived at the office. However,  the whole process was very comfortable. I did not experience any pain. Even this💉 didn’t hurt. Dr. Pipkin is so kind and gentle. I could tell by her interactions with her staff, that she’s also probably very easy to work for. She seemed very down to earth and patient with her staff as well as her patients. Her office has the latest technology.  She and her staff is very knowledgeable. By far one of the best experiences I have had with dental work. She and her staff made it so easy. I found my new dentist office for sure😁.  Thank you Pipkin Dental. My teeth are smooth & Shiny again.< /text>< Pictures>

Hands down an AMAZING dentist office! I am absolutely terrified of the dentist, but after finding Victor Valley Dental I won't go any where else! My entire family only comes to this office. The staff, the dentist, the entire visit, every time, has been great! I couldn't ask for better and they have truly put my fears to rest. If your looking for a clean, professional and great place to bring yourself and family to have your dental care needs met,  this would be the place  Thank you so much Victor Valley Dental!<//Review>

Although I had a  couple of cavities I wasn't in any pain from them but now Im in pain from the cavity being drilled out so deep I had a root canal but I'm still in pain because tooth next to that one also needs one as well. I've been in pain since the Thanksgiving holidays. Hopefully I won't be spending Christmas in pain. I'm sick of taking ibuprofen it hurts my stomach. It's going to be another weekend of throbbing pain waiting for an authorization for yet another root canal. I'm tired of being in  pain. I want it resolved.once and for all.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The agent they use to deaden sensations do no word for me. The dentist was concerned with my comfort and payed attention to my demeanor and comfort. A pleasant experience, as pleasant as a visit to the dentist for major work is possible. I am a bad patient and they put me at ease.<//review><UserId.>116832818985150886648< /UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5</rating>< Date>

I have been going to this dentist group several years.  They are very efficient and professional and very gentle for their work. I would say,
if you need a dentist, there is no better in the High Desert to go to< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>If I  could give them 10 stars I would!   This group is outstanding---  they are knowledgeable and skillful,  and so kind and gentle.   I just had a root canal which was pain-free,  including the shot, performed by  Dr. Enriquez,  with Letty assisting.  Jane, Mika and Sandy are the front office staff, and they do an excellent job. They know exactly what will be done for you that day.  In a couple weeks I will meet with Dr. Pipkin and she will continue my dental care.<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>Pipkin Dental is the most dedicated practice I have ever dealt with.  They are all about the patient!  They are gentle and kind!  Their expertise is beyond any dentist I have dealt with!  And, I am almost 70 years old!!!!!!

I really like this office and all of the staff, Dr. Pipkin is always smiling, very kind and friendly and when I took my daughter for the extraction of all of her wisdom teeth, I was very impressed with their service  I even enjoyed watching part of a Disney movie in the waiting room, I highly recommend this office, and even though I live in victorville, it's worth the driving.< /review>

My first time ever going to a comic book store, the guy working there was so nice and extremely helpful. The other customers were pleasant and willing to give advice. Overall an amazing atmosphere and I definitely will be returning.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I have known Stephen socially for years and was thrilled when I heard that he was turning his passion into his business. I live in NYC and read DC occasionally and have a place that I like to go to browse and pick up new and back issues (I am currently collecting old Little Archies). Unfortunately, due to the pandemic laws, the shop was not allowed to ship to me nor was I able to go and pickup curbside. So, in April I reached out to Stephen to find out if he'd ship. It seemed ridiculous to buy from a shop all the way on the other side of the country, but I'm glad that I did. Not only could I help a friend, not only could I support a small owner run business, but I appreciated Stephen's passion and work ethic. Let me tell you a brief story - the place I mention above that's here in NYC has a great selection and I really like the guy who runs it, but they fail at followup. I've had to chase them multiple times to order things and simply respond to emails. With Stephen, not only has he been on top of every order/communication, but just a couple weeks ago reached out to me to ask if I'd like to purchase new issues of X&&Z that I have been following. In two days they were in my hand. Now that's a good businessman and anyone who can follow up better than me has my respect and my business. Going forward, as long as it makes sense to continue buying from a store 3000 miles away, I will. BTW the issues showed up in pristine condition. I am truly grateful to Stephen for being able to provide a service during a difficult time. Getting a little package of goodies in the middle of this horror show has been a godsend. I highly recommend Interstellar!!</Text>< pictures>

Like Vesuvio next door, Interstellar Comic Books & Collectibles, for me, is about the history - and you can still see Larry wandering about.  Nice.Another very cool feature of Interstellar Comic Books & Collectibles is that you can use their address for mail if you don't have a permanent PS address.</review>

This is a funky, fun offbeat sort of place. The perfect spot to get geeky. The gentleman behind the counter was friendly and extremely helpful. I was with a friend that wanted to check it out and he had a great experience. If you like comics and collectibles, stop in for a visit.</Review>

<Review>Well stocked for new issues from both majors and leading independents but thinly stocked for trades despite acres of shelving of trades. Clean, almost minimalist store display in a modern red/black design scheme.

Friendly and amenable manager. Space has been added at the back for MTG players. Opening hours/days can be unpredictable - best to call the store before making a special trip down there. Good location.

It doesn't have a sense of community yet, but there's a sense that the store is slowly evolving and gradually finding it's way.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The staff was very friendly and helpful, but the selection was tiny. They only had two small shelves of comics in the entire store. One shelf Marvel, one shelf DC. Very limited selection with in those small book shelves. Hopefully they will add more shelves in the future; maybe it was like that because ot is newly opened.</Review>

<Text>I went there yesterday and the store was actually a lot smaller on the inside than what it looks like from the street. It does have a smallish collection of comic books, but that will change over time. It has a number of other collectibles, including a few Magic the Gathering packs of the recent sets.

The owner has also taken the time to go to wizards and have the capacity to have sanctioned events for FNM. He seems genuinely willing to have an aside project just for magic by devoting the space for us. To this end I am extremely satisfied with what I saw and experienced there. I am going to do everything I can to make sure this place succeeds.</Text>< date>

<review>I was coming to this comic shop weekly along with my brother.We would both spend a minimum of 20-30 dollars each time. I thought I would set up a pull list to get some of the newer comics releasing before they sold out as I wouldn't be in the area until Friday.So I set up the list leave my name and number. Come back the following week Friday and ask the guy with glasses who I assume is the owner about my pull list he had my name down but did not pull one single comic I had asked for.He then went on to tell me that that some of the comics he had pulled for me were on the rack where anyone could have grabbed them....uhhh okay that's your pull list?
I wonder if others got he same treatment.
Owner then went to the back and pulled a copy DC rebirth which I had asked for and a captain America variant that I did not want.
Wanted the original .But I guess this guy figured he could sell or keep the issues for himself and f*** the customer.You have truly lost mine and my brothers business ,there was not much keeping me going here in the first place besides it being close.So I will now frequent desert oasis.</review></record></dataset><record>

Visited from out of town. Great shop with very friendly customer service. Found a lot of issues to fill in gaps on some of our current, incomplete collections. Also have us tips on other places we should visit while in the area including the two shops in Palm Desert, and Frank and Sons up near LA. Wouldn't have been as cool of a vacation without his advice.< /review>

<Review>I ultimately love the food here and the employees but recently I have been having this one cashier that I don’t really like. The other cashier I had was all positive and happy, I felt more welcomed or assured. But the recent one currently I don’t feel no positivity at all, she/he would have the straightest face. When I would ask what’s in a certain food, she/he would be like, “I don’t know , I’m not the chef” and yah I understand that. But the other one I had, had the info what was in the food which was helpful.
Overall I love the food. Great place.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x8093fe9cc20e0131:0xc8dad3fd78415e4b<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1586051565936< /Date><rate>1</rate><Review>"I'm sorry you feel that way" is a response that my family member was given after calling to complain. We got overcharged for trying to replace chipotle sauce on a tostada with sour cream. The drive-thru person said it wasn't possible to sub the sauce, but we did that at another location in the area.

We'd rather risk getting E. Coli again from Carl's Jr on the other side of the bridge than come back here. Y'all also weren't wearing any gloves like you should have been. Literally the only location I've seen where they aren't wearing gloves while working.

It's a good place to go if you're looking to be disappointed.<//Review>< pictures>

Can’t believe how  the lady manager even got her job. Don’t have any customer service doesn’t know how to talk to a customer and make it right. They messed up my nacho and basically accused me not ordering them right and like I was trying to get something for free. Won’t be going back there anymore sad.< /text>

Great balance of high-quality fish and beef, bright flavors, acids, citrus and nuanced preparation. Surprisingly consistent for a new restaurant. Attentive service and cheery holiday appointments. Interesting herbal cocktails.< /Text>

The fusion dishes were flavorful, colorful and varied. Cocktail menu is incredible, with helpful visual cues: simple, high quality ingredients come together so well—great wine list too. Personable and engaged service. Can’t wait to come back and try the rest of the cocktail menu and dishes we missed! Japanese cheesecake with huckleberry sauce and the Halibut dish with crispy quinoa (pictures below), just a couple of the standouts!</review>< user>

Good drinks , Interesting food , Just wish they had a couple of good Flavourful Vegetarian/Vegan Options.
The ones they have arent enough for me to choose to eat here , Maybe just okay for a drink .< /review>

Get ready to be enchanted.  This is one of the finest restaurants anywhere.  They have everything right.  And not one ingredient is in its original form - something creative has made each one special - even the garnishes.

A warm welcoming decor that's casual and elegant all at once.  The personnel introduce themselves without the "I'm your waiter Bob" line and not necessarily on the encounter.

I ordered a Pisco Sour, the national drink of Peru.  Pisco (a Peruvian Brandy), lemon juice, simple syrup and then egg whites that provide a smooth foam.  On par with the best I've had in Lima.

Then to the yellowtail ceviche.  Perfectly cut, not a hint of connective tissue and a sublime marinade with tiger milk, sliced red onion and nuts to add some crunch.  Beautifully served in glazed handmade pottery.

On to Panacota for dessert.  Add toasted quinoa sprinkled on top and have it sit in fermented honey, then artfully place pieces of what they call "Forest" on top.  They look like shaved bark, they have some crunch and the taste is mildly sweet and savory - a wonderful accompaniment to the not overly sweet dish.

Bottom line.  A winner any way you want to measure a restaurant.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The place is very cozy. The attention is good, but they do not have much attention to detail, several times they took us dishes that we had not asked for. The main courses are better than the entrees. Although I must say that they are rich too. I was not a fan of cocktails

(Original)
El lugar es muy acogedor. La atención es buena, pero no tienen mucha atención al detalle, varias veces nos llevaron platillos que no habíamos pedido. Los platos fuertes están mejor que las entradas. Aunque debo decir que son ricas también. No fui fan de los cócteles<//text>< pics>

I'm giving them a 3 because it's both Good and bad experiences. One of the counselors was always rude to me. A few drama filled people staying in the woman's part when I was there. Also not very much focused on Jesus and the gospel. As for the good, Good cooked meals clean and had a few caring and nice staff members.<//text>

<Review>Jesus Saves this is a amazing place to restore & reset & rebuild your life, everyone starts somewhere.  This place helped me 12 years ago, I am forever grateful & continue on my sober journey. To God be the glory. Staff is great, skills, & tools are available. Jesus took a pipe out of my hand & replaced it with a bible, I will never go back to drugs. God bless all Staff it took a whole village of you to help me overcome my struggles, you're the best.< /Review><UserId.>110288262545971895865</UserId.>< pics>

I am Power of Attorney for my father who is a client of Stockton Rescue Mission in Stockton. They serve as his Payee. Just recently I brought my father home to live with me, he require 24 hour care. I set up a care provider to be with my father while I was at work. Because my father is not eligible for IHSS we both have to pay the provider out of our pocket. My father has a VA pension along with Social security. I pay for half the providers hours, and my father the other half. I send in invoice to the Payee and time card to the payee on that time card it shows the amount I pay and the amount my father is to pay. The payee said she sent the check for the care provider out on a Wednesday,. We live in Elk Grove, come Friday, I informed her the check had not arrived, she said it will be there. come that following Monday the check still hadn't arrived. The care provider was beginning to worry about his pay. Come Tuesday the check still had not arrived. I contacted the payee and informed her the check still had not arrived and I would like to pick the check up for the care provider in order for him to continue working with my father as I work. I work in Stockton and it would have been no problem to pick the check up. She in turn told me she cannot issue another check. I asked her, to please put a stop payment on the "check" you sent out and re-issue another check. I informed her this could be really bad, because the care provider is threatening not to continue work if he is not paid. I also informed her, I was unable to take off anymore days from work, or it could cause me to loose my job. She didn't care. She never responded back again. I tried calling her several times, I text her, and I sent out emails to her, to no avail. She never responded back. When I went home that night, I had to show the care provider that I was really trying to get his pay. I showed him the emails and the text messages that I sent. By the grace of God he agreed to come back the next day.
The next morning as I was heading to work, I received a call from the care provider informing me that the Payee called him and informed him that the check was mailed out, she also informed him that I wanted her to put the check in my name which was a flat out lie. As my fathers Power of Attorney, in which I supplied a copy of the Power of Attorney to the Gospel Rescue Mission in Stockton, directly to his payee, I speak for my father. My father has several different disabilities including Parkinson and sever  psychological  disabilities. The payee is very much aware of this. She still did not put my father's best interest first. She didn't care if we lost the care provider, she didn't care if I lost my job because my father cannot be left alone. She just didn't care. When I realized this, I began looking for a new payee service for my father. I removing his services from this place, because they clearly don't care about the client well being.<//text>

I haven't been resident there, but do have a friend who is in program. I saw him at his Graduation, also at his Wedding, and the change is nothing short of Miraculous! "Praise The Lord!"  He is doing great, very happy & looks SO healthy ~ Truly "a changed man", by the Grace of God & the help that he's received at Gospel Center Rescue Mission!  It was not EZ, but change for the better rarely is. I'm certain he'd tell you it's well worth the effort.😁
I am thrilled to see him getting this 2nd chance to have a good life, as God intends we should have - a clean & sober life, filled with hope for the future!  His wife & kids are part of this New Life as well. More than 1 life was "rescued" & given new life with so much hope & promise!

Gospel Center Rescue Mission is MORE than a shelter...MORE than just drug rehab... it's all that & so much more!  From the CEO, on down, the people there really care & the help they offer is personal, caring, hands-on. This place goes above & beyond ~ it truly changes lives, from the inside out, with God's Divine Help!
For all these reasons, I am also a donor & supporter of their mission.  I urge everyone,  go to their website & check out this amazing place!
With extensive programs & types of assistance, there is always a need for donations of all kinds (not just financial). It's all truly appreciated & put to very good use.  Check out their website & see what you may be able to do, to help this wonderful place continue helping "the least of these" & changing lives.

I've become a proud supporter, but, for the record, am not otherwise affiliated with Gospel Center Rescue Mission.< /Review>

The center helps community members to get back on their feet ,they feed homeless and has program to help them to get jobs, clothes etc.  If you like to donate clothing or items would help our community because they are used for men and woman who want to be successful and gets them a starting point to move forward and contribute back.<//Review>

Called the other day because I needed to file a report and the officer who called me back was extremely rude and not helpful at all. Your job is to serve and protect your community, yet someone from your community was calling for help and you treated me like dirt. So very disappointed.</text>

I've had multiple bad experiences with these "public servants" now. I called them to help with the theft of my store and I've had an officer call me and say he just drove around the building and didn't see anyone but I walked outside while talking to him and he wasn't even at my store,then I said well they're still inside my store; he told me he'd "turn around" and come help. Two hours pass then the customer walked out with store merchandise.
Every time I call for help they act very rude like I'm wasting their time just to get a simple no trespass order since that's what the police officers told me to do when I'm catching repeat thieves. This department is very lazy and refuses to protect and serve<//text>

In my personal experience with this department The lack of training in dealing with domestic violence, children, and special needs, needs to be addressed and more education needs to be provided. In my personal experience with this department it has made me feel uncomfortable uneasy and upset to think if something happens I have to call them. I strongly support law enforcement but this department would benefit from more program training in dealing with the public.< /text>

People in Citrus Heights go up to the cruisers to tell our officers how much they appreciate them. The story goes that when one of our officers asked a transient why he kept coming back to Citrus Heights, he answered that the police were so nice here. The chief of police has won the Paul Q Wilson award twice, which recognizes community policing. So proud of these men and women.< /Review>< pictures>

I just witnessed a moment every citizen would appreciate. Not the sad arrest of a negligent mother, but the way the policeman handled the child in the back seat of the vehicle... as if it were his own child. He embraced the child with love and protection, putting the child at ease in a potentially traumatic moment. Bravo. Thank You CHPD< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Thank you officers for your quick response tonight. It was not an emergency situation, but I was happy to see you guys at our building when I called your non-emergency number to report after hour loiterers at the  Sylvan Oaks Library. People are uncomfortable returning their materials to the depository when there are people hanging out around the library building at all hours. There is vandalism on the outside of the facility, especially when people hack into the electric outlets and light fixtures to plug in their electronic devices. These "campers" also leave trash all around the building, which has to be cleaned up by the library staff, especially after Sunday and Monday when we are closed.</text>< Pics>

<review>Have had multiple experiences where the short answer given to me is to handle things myself or cough up money for the court. I also frequently receive contradictory information from this same department about ordinances and law. I am very dissatisfied with my local law enforcement, I feel very let down as a citizen and as though I don't matter to them. There is no service in "Protect and Serve".< /review><time>1560773405411<//time><response>None<//response>< rating>

Typically I have had nothing but good experiences with the Citrus Heights Police Department.  Unfortunately, today has been the exception.  This morning at 6am my husband came out to find his car had been broken into.  We understand this is a small case, but there have been multiple car break-ins around the area and we have the description of 2 suspicious men in our area.  We were told that an officer was being dispatched to our home to dust for finger prints and make a report.  It has been over 4 hours and no officer.  We called once and was told they would be to our home within an hour.  When that hour came and went, we called again and were then told 'sorry our officer is on a bigger case'.  We are homeowners, tax payers and members of the community.  Pretty sure that our tax dollars go in part to fund our police.  Today, I can say that I am dissatisfied with with police response and based on this lack of response it seems the cars in our neighborhood will continue to get broken into and I guess we will all hold out hope that their crimes do not escalate to something more serious!</Review>

<Review>Recently, I received a traffic citation from a Citrus Height's Police Officer. Like most drivers, I did not enjoy receiving the ticket. However, I must say that the officer was so polite that I wanted to invite him to my home  for my back yard barbeque that I was speeding to. Kindly, with a friendly smile on his face, he declined my offer.

I LOVE them!  Whenever I have had to call about a suspicious vehicle or illegal parking or whatever,  they have responded!  I love having their presence in Citrus Heights and seeing them pull over people for talking on their cell phones.  I feel very protected living here.  Calling them about a cable issue,  is NOT the police problem. Call the cable company to report it!< /review>

I had a attempted break in couple days ago. Fortunately, I was home and handled it. Tonight, I requested a K9 unit to search my house because transients are still trying to break in? Did they leave or hide something? The CH Sheriff department very polite, respectful, and understanding after clearing my house. THANK YOU

These are situations we love and respect the police, why don't we EVERYDAY?< /text>

Useless staff. Acted like she couldn't be bothered. I wanted to know why a helicopter was buzzing my house announcing "keep your doors and windows locked, don't answer the door". First she said get the info from sac county PD, as they don't have a helicopter. I live in orangevale near CH. Told her they referred me to her as it was an assist for their Dept. Could only say they were looking for someone. Completely useless!<//Text>

<review>CHPD Cops that lack common sense should be fired. The temperature of the asphalt parking lot would have been close to 170 degrees, according to estimates by the National Weather Service. An egg begins frying at about 144 degrees, and human skin “is instantly destroyed” at 162, according to the service. Nelson was held down on the pavement for five minutes or more.  This is going to cost tax payers big time</review>< Pics>

<Review>Citrus heights police department would not respond to a call I made regarding my upstairs neighbor who was also an employee of the apartment complex. I had seen a fiber optic cable hanging from their apt pointed directly into my unit. I than rented a scanner to detect further surveillance equipment which it did directly over me in the living room., Citrus heights PD would not respond saying " people don't do that in citrus heights." I suffered further trauma at the hands of these same neighbors/employee to the point where we moved out. This would have been prevented had I established this police report and arrest. The same employee than went onto make a key to my apartment and I suffered further trauma and stress. Instead of her being fired and arrested we moved out of the complex. A few months later I was harassed by an officer at a house we were living at down the street off Sunrise Avenue. The officer said he had been notified by neighbors that I was a squatter and said that I didn't belong there. I had to have the owner call him to verify me as a resident of the home even after I showed him bills with my name on them.</Review><Gmap_id>0x809ade52bbc9c719:0x7cb44804a41b93f9< /Gmap_id></record>

Report a crime and get interigated as if you are the criminal. They DO NOT* know the meaning of "To Protect & Serve". Absolute disgrace* to the community. I am ashamed to be a citizen in their town- Disgusting!</text>

I called to report a fire because the fire department was closed and the call rang for about 8 minutes before I hung up. When I went in to report a complaint against a local business, the woman at the front desk ignored me and then was awfully rude once I finally got her attention. They offered no assistance and no suggestions. This station needs to recruit some staff that actually wants to help it's citizens. Disappointing.</text>

<review>Counter personnel seem to feel their job is to prevent access to police investigators and staff. Once you force the issue via Administration, you are able to get help; however, it has appeared that there is a LOT of pre - judgements going on, based upon background & not objective evaluation of current information.  I was very frustrated when I tried to get help for legitimate issues on a few occasions.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Was on sylvan corners getting a pizza tonight at little ceases and when I was getting into my car I seen a citrus heights police car parked then hear sirens and see flashing lights. As cars pull over to the side of the road, I see the cop come speeding up like a emergency was taking place so i think there's somthing going on but when the cop gets out of his car I hear him say to his fellow officer "see told you I can make it hear in less then five minutes" then they laugh and go into Starbucks and order coffee. Wow that's a little to much  someone please give these people some sense of what is right and what is wrong. They are just bullies.< /review>< Pictures>

I dont believe the CHPD came to anyone's home with sniffer dogs to make sure transients hadn't left something there. They don't do "prevention". They come only if youre already dead.</text>

Second most unprofessional LE personnel I have ever dealt with.  If I witnessed a CHPD in distress, I would turn my head and walk, scumbags are on their own. Sac Co Sheriffs are a complete different story. I would go out of my way to help a sheriff.Would not surprise me at all if the populous started revolting towards CHPD and their Nazi mentality.

By the way, I had one experience with an Officer Jones whose conduct was  exemplary while conducting a traffic stop on me for speeding. Very professional, and personable.

Just let it be known that we have multiple videos and photos of questionable conduct just waiting for that right moment, and I cant wait for that moment.

<Time>1445099340312<//Time><review>I was in a car accident and requested an officer come by to write a police report. The dispatcher refused to send anyone over. I asked her about 3 times explaining that i need someone over and she responded that if there are no injuries we send no one. Consequently, my car has not been fixed from the damage due to both of us having liability and the other driver getting arrested the day after he hit me for drug possession. This happened all the way in MARCH! I have a hole in my car that looks like a shark bit through it! When i go to base its the laughing stock of the whole facility. Thank you CHP. I should've stayed in WI where they actually respond.<//review>< resp>

<Text>PERSONALLY, I HAVE ONE BAD EXPERIANCE WITH THE CHPD. I WAS GOING THROUGH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE WITH MY KIDS FATHER WHEN I WAS 20, (I AM 29 NOW). THEIR WAS AN ICCIDENT ONE 4TH OF JULY @ 3AM , MY KIDS FATHER AND 2 OTHER MEN KICKED DOWN MY DOOR AND PROCEEDED TO GRABMY 2 BOYS OUT OF BED. I HAD A COUPLE GIRLFRIENDS STAYING OVER FOR 4TH OF JULY AND I YELLED TO ONE OF THEM TO CALL 911. DURING THAT PROCESS I WAS FIGHTING TO GET ONE OF MY KIDS AWAY FROM HIM. THERE WAS YELLING AND SCREAMING AND MY FRIEND HAD THE PHONE RIPPED AWAY AND DISCONNECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF SPEAKING TO THE 911 OPERATOR 3 TIMES AND THEY STILL DIDNT SEND ANYONE  OVER RIGHT AWAY. THE COPS DID NOT SHOW UP UNTIL 30 MINUTES AFTER THE GUYS LEFT WITH MY CHILDREN. THEN ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME, "YOU NEED TO TELL TE DISPATCHER THAT ITS IN EMERGENCY" REALLY? I THOUGHT THE SCREAMING AND THE PHONE BEING DISCONNECTED 3 TIMES WOULD HAVE EEN A GOOD SIGN ALONG WITH ME NEEDING TO EVEN CALL 911 TO BEGIN WITH. I KNOW THIS DOESNT SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE CHPD, BUT THAT NIGHT JUST HAD ME LOSE FAITH IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I had dirt and hair left I have attached a picture, it won’t let me post a picture. I also had some Gain air freshener under my seat and they took it. It was not empty or trash and there ability to clean a car was poor. I paid for a wash, vacuum and wipe down. They took it upon themselves to not clean my car and I can’t believe they do that to travelers. I will be sure to go somewhere else next time since I come thru SB a lot.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< time>

Average car wash, with a side of mismanagement...and verbal abuse.

Today (4/15) around 1pm I took my car in to get gas/wash, received my ticket from an employee who confirmed make/model/color of my car, and headed to the register.

While in line, Rob (the manager working at the gas pumps) walks in screaming at me that I took someone else's ticket, that he had called out another car and I took a ticket from him by mistake (untrue). Takes the ticket from my hand, I follow him outside and there's now more than 3 customers (myself included) waiting while he yells at me explaining that a Highlander and CR-V are two different cars. Swaps tickets between several customers and walks off.

I take the new ticket to the register and am given the total after my card is charged - over $20 more than possible for the size of my gas tank. I tell the cashier and he says I'd have to go back and get a different ticket. I told him I don't want to go back out and get screamed at by Rob so I'll pay the extra and be done with it.

Congrats to the lucky customer who got a cheap tank of gas, I paid the difference on yours. I hope that Rob gets placed in a role where he isn't working with customers.

I've been a customer of Educated for over 10 years, and they have a reliable service, sometimes exceptional, other times average. Cannot beat the convenience of having your gas/car taken care of while you relax. After today, I don't think I'll ever go back. It's not worth being screamed at and treated this poorly.<//Text>

Cheap gas if you buy a car wash. The lot is small and crowded but they have a good system and do a good job. They cleaned the interior and sifted through tons of miscellaneous receipts and personal items in the car. When they finished the car looked great and all of the personal items were stacked neatly on the back seat.<//Review>

< Review>
I've been here a couple of times, and every time I tell myself I'm going to give them another chance and every time they seem to fall short. First, the service is great when you arrive. Straight and to the point, and the gas prices are great! I've tried everything from the most basic wash to, most recently, the super wash. For the amount I paid I expected extreme attention to detail, and I always find that they miss sections that usually require a bit more elbow grease. Not too sure if this is a common experience, and I thought if I paid more the quality would change, but I recommend you only go to educated mainly for the cheap gas prices and a basic wash.<//Review>

After my car wash was done there were still mud splatter stains by my tires. They also didn’t take the time to dry the car, so there was water streaks everywhere. Whoever said bring your own towel could not have been more correct.<//Review>

Horrible service quality. They didn't vacuum under the floor mats, wipe down the door jams, Windows clean on the inside.  I had to point out a bunch of places they miss while wiping my car.  When I asked them,  they said that was not included in the regular wash.  Waste of $15.  Straight up, service sucks.  first time I was there my wash was great. Service just went down hill fast,  I had to point out places they miss more often. If you don't complain and tell them. They will collect your money and give you a dirty car that is cleaner than what you came in with.  One star for that.<//text>

Customer service is horrible!!!!  Not was I only over charged for something I did not ask for. Spoke with manager who yelled at me and mocked me. He told me I was not welcome back. It was not about the money, it was about the employee who lied about what happened. All I excepted was honesty and an apology yet I got yelled by management!! I am a local. I will inform my friends and family about what happened here and let everyone know this is a dishonest company. It is hard for me to even give one star but only allows me to do one star. It was a absolute horrible experience.< /text>

<review>MAKE SURE YOU BRING A TOWEL.
I rarely use the services of this car wash,  but when I do, I am always disappointed.  The car is NEVER thoroughly dried.  I always ask the attendant to dry wet spots that I see, but bring a towel to dry the remainder near the car wash.  Additionally, the car always smells when I get inside.  My trunk is inconsistently vacuumed, even though I have paid for “Full Serve”.< /review><gmapID>0x80e9152747c1d6c7:0xafbd87cdac51d6ee<//gmapID>< user_id>

I'm struggling to even give this place a one star. The customer service here is pathetic. I received bad attitudes from their staff and the quality of the carwash was questionable, as in I question myself if they just hit my car with a quick blast of the hose and let it sun dry. Very disappointed.< /review>

I have been going there for over 25 years and have always been happy with the service. However, things change and not always for the better. I'm not sure what has changed, but the quality of the service has definitely gone down(a very steep) hill. I have had to really check the car out recently - the fenders weren't washed, the windows had streaks. The final straw was two day ago. When I went to look at the car, the usual mud had not been washed off the front. But worse, the hood looked like it had been smeared with some kind of goo. I went to the cashier who couldn't find the front manager, so said I needed to find the manage who was in the back. Well, he was busy but would be there "soon". I went back to my car and waited. After 5 minutes, the front manager came out. I started to show him the problem when the back manager showed up. I started to explain the problem and one of them said "now cool down, we'll fix the problem." Well at that point, I wasn't angry, but when I pointed out the condition of the hood and that it looked worse now than when I brought it in, all they could say was "that's not our problem, it need to be waxed." I said that it didn't look that bad when I brought it in. "Well we couldn't do that". It was like being in the movie "Dumb and Dumber". What about these spots on the hood? "We can't get those off."
Like I said, I have been going there for over 25 years. But no more. I know enough about cars to know that they could have cleaned it but did not. And they were just too lazy to run it through again. I took it home and washed it myself and it came out fine. This is a sad case of what used to be a good place has gone down hill.
Go some place else, shoddy work should not be rewarded.</review>

<Text>I got my car washed and 20 minutes later it very briefly rained.  My car looked horrible so I went back to get a rinse.  THEY DO NOT GIVE A RAINCHECK RINSE EVEN 20 MINUTES LATER IF OUT OF NOWHERE IT DRIZZLES.  DO NOT GO THERE UNTIL THEY CHANGE THEIR POLICY!!!
I won't go back unless they do.  How often do we get rain anyway?</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

One of the worst car washes I have ever gotten! Windows left with smudges, dash or doors not wiped, but worst of all is the smell of rotten water left behind.<//Review>

I received excellent service at the Atascadero location. My car was damaged and the insurance company made a reservation for me and they followed up and had a car waiting for me. the entire process was easy and smooth and everyone at the office was very kind and helpful. I would highly recommend this location.< /review>

Usually have a great experience with this location.  Staff is always super nice.
Unfortunately this will be the last time I rent from here.
Arrived about 45 min after the pick up time. Was given the only vehicle on the lot . It had not been cleaned,  because I had never had issues with the vehicles at this location, I did not inspect onsite.  The car had dirty foot prints on the back of the seats, filthy trunk with mud stains etc Called 10 min after I left and asked that they clean it. Went back and was given another vehicle (keep in mind no other vehicle was at the lot when I had arrived 10 min prior) again this vehcile had not been cleaned and had a warning that an oil change had to be done. Called was told it was fine no service needed. I cleaned the vehicle bc I didn't have time to go back and get it cleaned.
On my trip, I had to get an oil change for it and spent half a day trying to get it into the shop. Annoyed that I had to clean the vehicle bc the person that helped me couldn't bother to get it done and on top of that spent my vacation getting the vehicle serviced. I rent and pay for a car so I wont have to deal with these things. With COVID it should be a  PRIORITY to have ALL cars cleaned,  sanitized and serviced prior to renting them out.<//Review>

No complaints. Very friendly staff. Was able to drop the car in Paso Robles, so I didn't have to drive out early in the AM. No after-hours drop off at this location.<//text>

<Review>We needed a car for 2 days while ours was in the shop. John came out to pick me up and took me back 2 days later when I returned the rental. They did not have the size car I had asked for so they gave me a better one at no extra cost. Andy at the front desk, and John were both wonderful!  They were amazing. I would go back to them and to enterprise anytime! This was in Atascadero, CA<//Review>< response>

<review>I 100% recommend renting a car with Enterprise. I rented a car from the Enterprise in Atascadero and I was worried because I had never rented a car before.

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Ok rented a minivan from this location. Had a flat tire in the Inland empire  region. Call center made me go all the way to LAX for swap out who gave me a beat up van. Older,  USB, no Bluetooth. It worked out okay in the end. So why five stars because just by mentioning it to the manger in office at the to line of return at Atascadero office I was given 10% off at already great price. I did not mention it with expectations of any price reduction. I just casually mentioned it but they went above and beyond.
They have good staff always quick to pick up and drop off.< /Review>< Resp>

Sorry, i will not return. I dont like the feeling of being rushed and staff not doing a good job. I have paid way less than your $32 for pedicures and it was better done.< /Text>

<Text>Everywhere else i get a pedicure, the ladies leave my toenails round n badly shaped without effort n its not a good look. But here the lady made them nice! Not sure the proper term to describe them but they're clean and well shaped. N my acrylics were well done.  The service was nice and easy n the ladies were very helpful and friendly. This is my new go to for sure<//Text><Date>1570559381867<//Date>< rate>

I've come on three different occasions and each time the gel polish peeled or bubbled, from one day to within a week. They will charge you $20 to redo your nails. Don't pay for poor quality product!<//Text>

The absolute best customer service I've received from a nail salon in Years. My co worker recommended this place to me and I am so glad she did, I honestly won't be going back to my old nail salon in temple city anymore. Everyone is so friendly here, I can't wait to come back and get a pedicure next time!!!</text>

Went to Top Pro Nails on Azusa Thursday. Today, Sunday my nails are peeling. Jenny did the powder dip. Cut me in a couple places but it happens so I let it go. Had a couple small bubbles. Again let it go. Gave her a $10 tip...ugh. Today my nails have bubbles and are totally peeling. I am so upset I paid for such bad service. Never again!!!< /Text>

< Review>
The girl that did my fingernails just got the instruments out of her drawer..."THEY were NOT individually packaged" as if to be autoclave which would be individually wrapped, sealed, with the date of the day they were autoclaved, and initials of the person who prepared them ...she was done in 11 min for plain manicure... polish and all...my cuticles were not pushed back and cleaned up the way they should have been so when she asked me "ok.. done.. how you like" .... I was very unsatisfied so I politely told her that I would finish them later...so she started to clip and clean more cuticle without taking the nail polish off first...and she was done....the man who did my pedicure barely wanted to touch my feet ...maybe this was his first day I don't know because he didn't speak English...so no massage.... I was done again 20 min...unsterilized instruments again.. I WILL NOT ever go back there again...NO THANK YOU $34 DOWN the drain.👎</Review>

Really nice, they take care of you.  I dont have a specific person I go to but once you walk in you feel comfortable.  Good area. They have a pedi menu. I think thats awesome. You know exactly what theyrr going to do to you. If youre getting something off the menu and want gel nail polish expect to pay a little more. Those things are always extra $ It does not come with the Pedi service.< /Text>

Found this shop online and decided to call. An extremely nice woman by the name of Jesse answered my call and was able to get me in on the same day. All I needed was a smog check done on my car and upon arriving I was greeted by Jesse at the front counter. The process was simple and was in and out within 15 minutes. I definitely recommend coming here as you are taken care of and the staff is very friendly. Thanks Jesse!<//Text>

Very pleased with the quality of service.  From the actual repair, pleasant and knowledgeable office staff, and the seedy offer to return me home and pick me up when the repairs were completed.  Class A operation no question.</Review>

First and most important to me: they have been professional and competent in their communication with me.  Too many places simply treat people poorly and/or unprofessionally.  And nearly as important, they were fast, competent and obscenely honest in the work they performed.  There were plenty of things that many other places would absolutely recommend that I have done that I really didn't need.  These guys didn't.

They have been awesome and it's great to have a trusted place to get auto service.<//Text>

We were towed here by AAA since our car broke down while traveling home from vacation . Everyone at Auto Professionals were more than their business name implies. They were very professional and extremely kind. They went above and beyond to help my wife and I resolve the problem with our car.<//review>

<Text>I brought my new (used) cardto Auto Professionals for them to look it over and make sure the car was in good shape. I also had a couple of concerns that they were able to look at and give me great feedback. They were very professional and honest about what they could and could not do on my vehicle. Unfortunately we did find out that they were not able to service my transmission due to the type of transmission it was and they said my best bet would be to take it to the dealer for that work.

I will definitely take my car back to them when it's time for service and because I'm in charge of my fleet vehicles at my company, I will even take my fleet vehicles to them for service. I was very happy with my encounter with the staff of Auto Professionals.< /Text><rate>5< /rate>< UserId.>

This time, our check engine light came on the afternoon before we were leaving to move cross country.  Even though they knew we weren’t going to be customers anymore 😢, the did everything they could to squeeze us in and get the problem diagnosed and repaired quickly. We were able to leave the next morning to start our journey. I only hope we will be able to find professionals as good as these people.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I had about 7 big issues; AC not functioning, 2 non functioning windows, windshield spray pump non functioning, transmission flush, motor oil replacement, engine tick, brake system check, that were all fixed in a day and a half. The price charged for fully repairing and restoring the entire motor and transmission was amazing specially with a AAA discount. I would recommend to take your trusted and valued vehicles to Auto Professionals, so they can fix and tune up your ride!<//Review><user>101859930331372546930< /user>< user_name>

<user_name>You'll be Floored<//user_name><Review>My truck broke down not far from their shop. I called them and since I had triple A, and it was about to be after hours, they told me to have it towed to their shop. Which I did. The next day they called me and told me my water pump had gone out and that the pulley was fused to another part of my motor. I gave them the go ahead to do the work and within a couple days they had it done. Since I lived far away, they kept it for a couple days extra without charging me for it. Upon picking up my truck, they offered to give me my parts that they replaced so I could see that they weren’t bs’n me, which I declined because they seemed trustworthy to me and didn’t think they where trying to get over by replacing parts that didn’t need replacing. They also informed me that they back up all their work and if anything went wrong that they’d take care of it. I made it home with no problems and thank the auto professionals for their expertise and professionalism. I would highly recommend them to anyone with car issues. Thank you auto professionals, you made a nightmare, into not that big of a deal and I appreciate that.< /Review>< GmapID>

I had other in town mechanics tell me that my oil leak was going to cost me $500-$1K. Auto professionals found the problem to the leak and my car is running better than ever 🥺🙏🏼. They were honest and charged me for finding just the oil leak, instead of overpricing me for non needed work!< /Text>

They will treat you right and will take their time to get to the source of the problem. Unfortunately many places will give you the run around and play games with you. However, at Auto Professionals, their name says it all. Greg and Jesse are tru professionals. And their prices are reasonable too. You will not be disappointed. Many thanks to the Auto Professionals!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80ec14a7a00596af:0x75fb9ce04ed90441< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They also would recommend you need this or that but will not do anything without talking to you first. They get to know their customers and treat them like they are family I would HIGHLY recommend  them to everyone. We can't say enough about this business, love the staff !!!. And did i say the prices are reasonable too. Auto Professional cares about people safety, and will deliver the best service as possible.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I’m fairly new to the area and when I called AAA and asked them for a recommendation they suggested auto professionals I rarely if ever leave reviews I’m a grandma so I’ve seen the best of customer service and the worst I was blown away by this company it was the day after a holiday I didn’t even think I’d get my car in they got it in they called me by 1030 they had it out in a couple of  hours and they even returned the car to my home but what really blew me away was the excellent customer service the follow up and the price.  I kept looking to see If they had included everything! I mean who does that with a mechanic? LOL I absolutely will be taking my car there and recommending them in the future<//Text>< Pictures>

<Name>Linda Lou Albera deLeon<//Name><Text>Kind, courteous, and with a smile. But my appointment was on Friday September 25 I felt like they made me think it was going to be a lot more than it was only because they put me off till the 29th. And I called before I came in the 29th. I was never given the impression they would have my vehicle over night .They should of explained that so I could of been better prepared. Telling me there wasn't no way to get the parts till the 30th. I just felt like they could ot better explained the situation so one could be better prepared .I was there for a vacuum leak and you need that to pass smog. My service engine light is still on and (!) point light that was on reason for me  being there. None of those lights can be on it I want to pass smog.

<Review>Today I had back to back appointments at work with no time for a break, so of course my battery died. I called Auto Professionals and they saved my day. They got me to the shop and had a battery ready to go so quick. They really were the hero’s of my day and my car. They’re always so friendly and helpful. I would, and have, recommended them to anyone and everyone including anyone who reads this.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>Well, what do you say....I feel like I'm actually getting help from a family member that I can totally trust. The mechanics have all the skill necessary to fix the tough jobs. My daily driver is 20 years old, and Greg treated it like any other vehicle that came into his shop. The car had multiple issues and he worked through every one of them until the car was back to running how I remembered 15 years ago. I have almost 300k miles on my old car and asked him to get me 3 more years if he could. His response "No Problem"!!!! That's what I wanted to hear. They get all my auto maintenance/repair work. Thanks Auto Professionals for being the goto neighborhood auto repair shop!<//Text></record>

<review>I walked in to make an appointment for a smog check. I was received within minutes. I was really lucky! The mechanic told me that he could help me if I had the time. He completed the smog check and I was gone. Only to pay the state for the privilege of driving on their roads.

I've been servicing my car here for the last few years, and I'm so happy to have found such a trustworthy and quality shop. Everyone is really friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and extremely honest. As a female that doesn't know much about cars I feel like I'm a pretty easy target to rip off, but I am 100% confident they would never do that. You can tell their main priority is helping their customers and providing them with the best service while trying to get you the best deal. I highly recommend!<//review>

Transmission went out on my Mountaineer and everywhere else I called offered little to no warranty. Auto Professionals had the best price in town and with almost 3 times the warranty coverage than anyone else. Friendly knowledgeable staff that just want to get you back on the road again. I've taken it back for warranty repairs and they are just as helpful as when the initial repairs were done. Thanks so much for all your hard work and assistance you all have done.</Review>

Everyone at Auto Professionals is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  They explain what the problem is and the necessary work will be clearly and
respectfully.  They make auto repair/maintenance easy.  I have referred them to my friends.</review>

<review>They are just as the name implies - absolute professionals. They were curteous the whole way through and gave me all the information I needed to know. They were very efficient in both my initial estimate and repairing my car, and I had my vehicle back on the road in no time. They even offered to give me a ride back to my home in Santa Maria. I will definitely recommend Auto Professionals to everyone I know.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Friendly service, honest work. I've since moved to the Bay Area but visit friends and family in Santa Maria every now and then. If I can time it with vehicle maintenance, all the better! I believe AAA members get a discount here.</review>

You always do a great job, your promises are kept and your prices are fair.  Also, you have performed a few little items for me without charge when I needed a quick fix on something.  Thanks for taking such great care of my Subaru.  I will continue to have my car serviced by Auto Professionals.
s
02-12-2020 New brakes all four, oil change, filters (all), new AAA car battery, new serpentine belt, brake fluid flush and they got my "all four" wheels alignment done for me. All goes with my four new Bridgestone tires. At 76,000 miles we're ready for another 70,000 miles. Subaru is a great car and Auto Professionals is the only place to have it serviced.  Did I mention AAA discounts given!
Five Star Service. Use them & you will be happy too.< /Text>

Honest courteous mechanics that is rare to find in any City. My poor roommate had been taking his car to other mechanics that were ripping him off they charged him $500 for nothing they were just cheats and liars and I've been telling them not to take it to anybody else but these guys at Auto professionals. They fixed his car for under $2 because he was a veteran. What good people they are! In a horrible world where everybody's trying to get rich off everybody else it's good to see some people still have morals and values.</text>

Extremely over priced and service takes way too long for the amount you're paying!! Bathroom was not cleaned, service was mediocre and let me re-emphasize how OVER PRICED this establishment was... Almost 400$ to change my transmission fluid!!! It's a simple drain and fill!! DO NOT take your vehicles here unless you enjoy getting butt-****** on the price of the service, which takes forever...<//text>

The next day they diagnosed the problem to be a heater box relay failure. They got the parts installed, did the smog test and all is good! It's always nice to know that these people know what they are doing and get it done right the first time.</Text>< pics>

The automatic transmission in our 1993 GMC 3500 would no longer go into reverse.  We called other shops and got prices and frankly a lot of "run-around".  Then we heard about Auto Professionals in Santa Maria from a couple of good sources, including a tow truck driver.  We called AAA and told them where we wanted the truck towed.  It turned out that Auto Professionals was one of the few shops in the area approved and recommended by AAA.  The whole experience was great.  The truck was ready before promised, other problems were fixed and the whole staff was very nice and certainly professional.  Even with the extra work which included a new A/C blower motor, some fuses and re-wiring the cost was less than the estimate.  On top of that we received a AAA discount on the job that helped out even more.  I would recommend this repair shop to anyone with a transmission or other vehicle problem.<//Text>

<review>The employees are very polite, but not very helpful or educated. I wanted a copy of my CT scan and they told me I had to wait for my doctor to review it first. There is absolutely no logic behind this. That is my medical record and my right to see my results. I wasn’t able to get an explanation of this logic, only that this was “the rule”.< /review>< pics>

<review>Best prices across Bakersfield. Quest is just awesome you take it prices, staff, timelines, call them each and every step was just wonderful experience for me.  Front end staff are very friendly same as advisors, technicians even the training staff each and everyone are just awesome. I think I had the best experience and suggest everyone to visit them if there is a requirement. God bless everyone and keep away from all medical needs everyone should be healthy. But if there is a need I would suggest Quest.<//review>< user>

All of the staff were very kind and understanding. I didn't want to go home. I work 2 jobs and I felt so comfortable there, that during my MRI I was able to relax and get a good 15 minutes of rest. Lol Yes I would definitely go back. They made me feel like family. Thank you for an awesome staff and visit.< /Text>

I was there for a CT scan. Everything ran on time and very professional. The registration process was efficient. The staff in  the  CT/MRI area were professional and attentive. The process was over rather quickly and I was on my way. I will continue to use Quest Imaging when the need presents it self.<//Review>

From arrival to departure all of the staff treated me with compassion and respect. The nurses and techs who screened me made sure I understood the procedure, the doctor who did my joint injection was gentle and efficient, and the MRI techs checked on me while in the tube, and held my hand, walking next to me step by step until I was steady when I was too scared to stand up on my own afterwards.<//Text>

I always request Quest for all my imaging. They are fast, and friendly and very professional. The best part of each visit is that you feel that they really care about you and your needs. It is as if you are their only patient, and your care and comfort are first with them. Why would you want to go anywhere else?<//Review>

<Text>I had an ultrasound and biopsy and everything went so well as explained by the wonderful staff.  Cheryl is tops in making me feel comfortable and well taken care of.  My only complaint is the lack of coordination between Quest and Kaiser for the mammogram at the Chester facility.  It took 4 month to get the mammogram scheduled.  I am not sure who dropped the ball at Chester Quest and Kaiser but intend to find out and I hope you do too.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Overall I had a very positive experience at Quest Imaging. The staff was professional and friendly and the waiting areas were very nice. I especially was appreciative of how nice the women's health wing was. It was clean, very centered towards women (women's magazines and HGTV on the tv), the dressing room and the restroom were very nice, and overall this area made me feel more at ease about the reason I was there. The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is because I wasn't taken back for my imagine until 30 minutes after my appointment and there was no communication. If an office is running behind, I totally understand, but would appreciate being told when checking in for my appointment so I can make sure I can make arrangements for my other obligations.</review>

I've had multiple MRI's here across the years from lots of sports injuries.  Every time i've been in, they are courteous, prompt, and get things done right away.  I'm not sure what else you could hope for beyond that!  It's also incredibly clean.</text>

My doctor ordered a stat exam and they got me in right away, they talked with the Tech and he was very accommodating even though they had a full schedule they still made way. The girl that registered me took me back right away and was very compassionate. When she called the scheduler to put me on the schedule the scheduler was very helpful and compassionate as well, the whole time I was there everybody had a great smile on their face and I just felt welcomed. When I was in the back with the Tech I thanked him for getting me in right away. He smiled and just said it was his pleasure. I felt at ease and really felt the love of God through these guys.

<Text>Cons
- did not like having only one waiting room for their MRI machines. As a female, I was not comfortable sitting in a hospital gown around men.
- scheduling an appointment was difficult. Their main appointment line was all computerized. Finally found another number to get a real person on the phone.

Pros
- good service
- great staff
- clean facility
-quick turn around time on imaging<//Text><name>Allie C< /name><pics>None< /pics><time>1553482659585< /time>< UserId.>

<Text>They are some of the most professional and nice people you will meet anywhere in the medical world. From the initial greeting, to handling the paperwork, meeting nurses and docs, the experience could not be any better. Everything was explained clearly, and you get the impression that they really do care about delivering wonderful service.  So, you can rest assured this is a great facility.  H.

I have used Quest Imaging several times. Quest provides professional and friendly service from the moment you walk into their facility. I was very impressed with their quick turnaround times and communications with my doctors office. I highly recommend their services.<//text>

Quest Imaging is one of the few medical services that posts the results of your test promptly! It is such a relief to get your test results within a few days and not have to wonder for weeks. The Stockdale location is the best facility in Bakersfield.<//review>

<text>This office is fantastic! The staff,  the nurses, the X-ray technicians, are all Pleasant, professional, and all share a caring attitude towards the patients whom they serve. Even without an appointment, the wait time is never very long and they always keep you apprised of what's going on. I would recommend this office to anyone who is looking for very professional care.</text>< Pics>

Recently had my routine mammogram at Quest on Stockdale Hwy.  I was seen in a very timely manner.  Everyone I encountered, from the person who scheduled my appointment over the phone, to desk receptionist, to registrar to technician, was very friendly and professional.  I have been going to Quest for several years and have always been happy with my experience there.</text>

<review>When I go to Quest Imaging on Stockdale Highway I am greeted with respect and kindness, and through the whole process I am treated with Respect and Kindness.
And when I am all done with the procedure I am told to have a Blessed Day and kindly told and shown how to exit the building.

I have already recommended Quest to friends. I have always had excellent service - have had mammograms, bone density scans and MRI's. From the receptionist all the way to technicians, everyone has been very helpful and compassionate. Thank you for your service to our community!<//Text>

<Review>How strange that there are so many negative reviews.  I have been going to Quest Imaging on Stockdale Hwy every time there was a need and the staff have been efficient, friendly, polite and just wonderful.  Never was there once an unpleasant incidence.  As with all, if  you show them respect, they return the same.< /Review>< name>

And concern was not phony.  I am highly  claustropic and they made me feel at ease. Several different individuals from receptionist to nurse to CAT tech were welcoming answered all my questions and made sure I understood procedure and what to expect.  Each were right on. They made sure that the disc from Kern radiology was downloaded and returned plus provided me with CD from the CAT scan. They had results from BUN and creatinine which was down at Stephen strategos’s Office. I had a pleasing and very positive experience.</review>< Pics>

<review>The only problem I encountered was the scheduling. I was initially told by a live person that my appointment would be at 7:45 a.m.  Later, I received a recording stating my appointment time as 7:45 a.m. but to arrive at 7:15.  Still later, I received another recording stating that my appointment time was 8:30 a.m but to arrive by 8:00 a.m.

Naturally, I didn't want to be late so I arrived at 7:15 a.m.  After completing the paperwork, I proceeded to wait while another person was taken to an office for processing. Soon, a staff member approached me, asked me what time my appointment was and reassured me that I would be next.  I learned that another patient who was also waiting had also received dual recordings. A staff member apologized for the recording mixup but my appointment was at the later time of 8:30 a.m.

I was not angry but this type of error should not be happening, especially so early in the morning.  This review is intended only to alert staff of the problem. Once my appointment time arrived, I received excellent care with only one hiccup of another wait time between tests.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>It is interesting to me that some people have published negative reviews.  I have many health problems and as a result have been to Quest Imaging many times for many different types of studies.  I have always found the staff to courteous, friendly and professional.  I guess everyone has a bad day now and then.<//Review><time>1418238534480</time></record>

Do NOT come here for an pregnancy ultrasound. They would not let me back to view so I missed out on seeing the sex of my first child. Even though we are married they would not let me back. My wife pleaded with the ultrasound tech to let me back, to no avail. Screw this place they are insensitive. They ruined what should have been a happy memory for me and my wife.< /Text>

I was told I would get a 45 min heads up to pick up my mom after a 4 hour scan, nobody called. She had to wait an additional 45 min, all without eating the entire day. Thanks for the "customer service".</Text>
