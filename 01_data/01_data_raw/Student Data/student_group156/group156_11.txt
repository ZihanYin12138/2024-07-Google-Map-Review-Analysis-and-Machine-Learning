Totally lied to us about core charges. Spent a good amount of money, waited 2 1/2 weeks for the motor to show up(was supposed to be a week), and then was told we had 90 days to bring in the core. Brought it in just over 30 days and they wouldn’t take it. I’ll go elsewhere.<//Review>

We bought a transmission at this location for  around 1,100 dollars. At first they told us it was going to take about a week to get here so after waiting the week we were given a very dirty looking transmission however since we had never bought a transmission before and it was supposed to be rebuilt we figured it was normal. On that weekend the mechanic that usually works on our truck told us that they must have messed up and gave us the a returned transmission because because of how dirty it looked, but since they don't open weekend he said he could try installing it for us and see if it works. When the transmission didn't work and we tried to get what we paid for they told us to bad because we decided to install it the warranty was voided ( I don't see how the warranty works then since to know is not working you have to install it) so they basically cheated us out of more than 1,000 dollars. My warning to you is be very careful of what they give you. As for us we are definitely never going there again, and will see if we can get them in small claims court.<//Review>

Help was great but the product (rims) that I had ordered for my vehicle were in worse shape then what I needed to replace.
Was told they were in great condition all had different chips and dings, they were quick and without question ready to refund my money since I wasn't satisfied with the car rims.
And yes I will still do business with them should I need to again.
I will just question the condition of the parts I need next time< /review>

< Review>
LKQ used to be a decent company, but not any more

We bought an engine from them and purchasing experience was horrible
The first engine they tried to sell us had 140 Kmi, but after we checked the vin through car fax the engine had more then 400 kmi (it had a rolled back mileage)

The second engine had nice mileage and vin number was clean, but the delivery was 2 days late, and also they charged us sales tax, even though we have resale number on file with them, and we have bought parts from them before.

They also charge a core for an engine, this is normal practice, -- unfortunately the last time we bought an engine from them, we couldn't get them to pick up the core.  I spoke with at least 2 or 3 different sales reps.  Each one of them assured me that core would be picked up within a week, and ..... nothing.

So to make a long story short, we will not be ordering from LKQ again, and unless you have a good legal team wouldn't recommend them to you either<//Review>

<review>Experience is evrything and mine hasn't been good, as far as for small business. They keep your credits on returned parts and still bill you for them and will apply it to your account in a few months, the have company policies that they don't share with you until you're in need of something and that's when you find out. I've used them for paint supplies, aftermarket and used. Across the board they're an epic fail. Will not work with you on getting your parts and supplies, give massive excuses on evrything  such as "it's corporate policy" I just started using other vendors like Benzeen, they get me what I need no excuses and better service and quality. Same with Kennedy Auto Wrecking and Rock N Roll. I use Quality Auto Body Parts as they sell the same stuff for fractions of the price, I think they even get their stuff from this place. I now have to move on to another vendor for my paint supplies and hearing from thepaint manufacture, I'm not the only one he has had to deal with on this. I highly recomend that you look elsewhere before using this place, only as a last resrot. If I could give a negative star rating that's what it would be.<//review><Time>1588950496493<//Time></record>

This place is horrible with customer service and poor product quality. Jan. Of 2020, I went there to order a speedometer cluster for my Chevy Suburban and the salesman, John McNabb sold me a 2002 Chevy Silverado part which h doesn't fit. I went back to reorder and got another that fit but the oil gauge doesn't work. I went back the 3rd time, he told he will take care of me personally and get me the right working part and the part should be here in two days. In 2 days, I went to pick it up and they told me the order was not been placed. He placed the order again and said it should be here by next week. After a week of waiting, I finally get my part that fit in working conditions. The price for the new part in much more than the one I originally ordered but he said he will price match it so I won't have pay extra for all the hassles. A month later, LKQ billed me the difference of the price for the parts. I called John and he said he will take care of it. A month goes by, I got a billing statement again with a late fee. So I called John again, he picked up the phone and I told him about the problem. He put me on hold for almost 30 minutes and hang up on me.

If this is the kind of service they do and quality of products that they sales. They just lost a customer.  Think twice before go there, especially John McNabb.</review>

2nd time I've called to use this company and had a great experience the first time. This time not so much! I've been on hold for over 20 mins so I decided to select sales to if maybe it's a tech issue. Not sure if I got his name but I want to say Bill? Hes the only one in sales because he was rude and then hung up on me when asked if I could get a word in and so I decided to call back to get his name and he hangs up on me! I'm still on the phone and will be taking this to management if I can ever get through!<//review>

< review>
I would have given it half a star but that wasn't an option . This place was HORRIBLE . The customer service was great. They were very friendly, and made things completely understandable but that doesn't take a way from my horrible experience . First, I paid $250 dollars for my part to be here in a matter of 3 days . On the fourth day I called and my part still wasn't in . On the 5th day Frank called me to notify me that the part had gone bad and he had to order me another part coming from a different place for the same amount but it'll take 8 days to get here . Mind you I paid $250 for it to get here in a matter of days . It was whatever , I really needed the part for my car . So I said that's fine . TEN days later I finally here back from him and something went wrong with the transaction . So he was going to refund me my money in a check , because I paid with cash . It took 10 days for me to get my refunded check . He also ordered me another part that took a week to arrive , FOR THE PART TO GET HERE AND NOT FIT . Worst experience of my life !!!!!!< /review>

The first engine which was installed by the crummy mechanic needed to be replaced.  This was a very long process without our family car... about 3 months because our mechanic was very bad and the warranty process from LKQ was extremely slow.  When we finally got our van back.... we supposed the engine was good and we continued to drive it.  The terrible mechanic had installed everything around the engine incorrectly.... this was no fault of LKQ.  We paid a whole lot of money fixing the incorrect installation.  We drove this van with an engine light on for 2 years until smog time came.  We decided to dive in and fix the misfiring issue.  $800 for a new fuel injection system.  It did nothing.  after a lot more time at the mechanic he informed us that our heads were bad.  Now remember this engine is only 2 years old with not a lot of use.  We were 1 month away from our LKQ warranty expiring.  They would replace our engine!!  We called them up.  Our warranty had been voided.  What?  We were never told.  When the gentleman looked it up he found that the first engine had had an object inside (remember crummy mechanic).   That is why the engine was bad.  They had cancelled our warranty without telling us.  They also brought in the second engine from a different company to replace our first engine.  We had to pay for this repair on our own.  thinking a used and fixed van is better than a car payment we spent $800 on new heads.  When we brought the old heads in... they were the wrong heads for that engine!!  So the engine we received from LKQ was a different company that rebuilt horrible.  We installed the new heads and we still had an issue.  We decided it was time to bring in the dealer.  What else could be wrong? Surely it is just a timing issue.  Well....$750 dollars late we have come to realize that we have a cracked cylinder head.  Engine block!!  The replacement engine LKQ delivered was garbage from top to bottom.  wrong heads that were not even rebuilt or rebuilt poorly and a cracked cylinder that we have been driving around for 2 years trying to fix.  We were under the impression that we had a good rebuilt motor.  We never had a rebuilt motor!   LKQ has put us through hell by acquiring a crummy engine for our engine replacement.  We have spent around $5000 trying to fix our van since receiving it back after the engine install and all LKQ would say is that it was not warranted because of the first engine.   They only way they would have helped was if we uninstalled the engine and had it shipped with our own money so that they could look at it and decide if it was worthy of a replacement.  Do not do business with LKQ they do not care about their customers.  I would rate them less than 1 if I could.</review>< time>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Called to order a supercharger for a customers car priced at $525 for a Jaguar, sales rep was not helpful at all. He said I had to call my local LKQ to buy the supercharger, so I did. Local LKQ says the supercharger is not priced correctly and its $1100. I asked them to call LKQ Stockton to verify and he said he cant. I called LKQ Stockton and same sales rep verified that the part is 525 but I still have to buy it from my local LKQ for $1100. It doesn't cost $575 to ship from California. Stockton location wouldn't sell directly to me and LKQ venice wouldn't sell for less than $1100. Something does not make sense.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I feel I must very much make a review, because we have had just about 3 years of nightmares associated with their business AND a shoddy mechanic.  The first engine which was installed by the crummy mechanic needed to be replaced.  This was a very long process without our family car... about 3 months because our mechanic was very bad and the warranty process from LKQ was extremely slow.  When we finally got our van back.... we supposed the engine was good and we continued to drive it.  The terrible mechanic had installed everything around the engine incorrectly.... this was no fault of LKQ.  We paid a whole lot of money fixing the incorrect installation.  We drove this van with an engine light on for 2 years until smog time came.  We decided to dive in and fix the misfiring issue.  $800 for a new fuel injection system.  It did nothing.  after a lot more time at the mechanic he informed us that our heads were bad.  Now remember this engine is only 2 years old with not a lot of use.  We were 1 month away from our LKQ warranty expiring.  They would replace our engine!!  We called them up.  Our warranty had been voided.  What?  We were never told.  When the gentleman looked it up he found that the first engine had had an object inside (remember crummy mechanic).   That is why the engine was bad.  They had cancelled our warranty without telling us.  They also brought in the second engine from a different company to replace our first engine.  We had to pay for this repair on our own.  thinking a used and fixed van is better than a car payment we spent $800 on new heads.  When we brought the old heads in... they were the wrong heads for that engine!!  So the engine we received from LKQ was a different company that rebuilt horrible.  We installed the new heads and we still had an issue.  We decided it was time to bring in the dealer.  What else could be wrong? Surely it is just a timing issue.  Well....$750 dollars late we have come to realize that we have a cracked cylinder head.  Engine block!!  The replacement engine LKQ delivered was garbage from top to bottom.  wrong heads that were not even rebuilt or rebuilt poorly and a cracked cylinder that we have been driving around for 2 years trying to fix.  We were under the impression that we had a good rebuilt motor.  We never had a rebuilt motor!   LKQ has put us through hell by acquiring a crummy engine for our engine replacement.  We have spent around $5000 trying to fix our van since receiving it back after the engine install and all LKQ would say is that it was not warranted because of the first engine.   They only way they would have helped was if we uninstalled the engine and had it shipped with our own money so that they could look at it and decide if it was worthy of a replacement.  Do not do business with LKQ they do not care about their customers.  I would rate them less than 1 if I could.< /Review>

This place is ran by clowns, very unprofessional. Called many times ahead to make sure everything is good, I come there not only its a 2 hour wait, plus they ran over my hood with a forklift, wasted my money to rent a truck, wasted time and fuel, workers didnt do anything to help me other than harass me to get out of there. Never coming back here again.< /Review>

Put in an order for a TCM on Monday and they told me it would arrive on Thursday. I called early Thursday morning and they said the order has been deleted for a while because they did not have the part in stock. Not once did they call me updating me about the order. Now my client and myself have wasted two days waiting for a part that never came.<//review>

<Text>Extremely shady business that is only interested in screwing people over. I thankfully never paid ahead of time, but they attempted a bait and switch. Check out the Yelp reviews as well. This place is absolutely horrible.

Do not trust these guys. Worst service ever! I called in for a part they said it'll be here in 2  days on Friday. But then i get a call 5 days later saying that the part is here. I drive over an hour to Stockton, first they made me wait over 40 minutes to tell me that the part isnt here yet. Why would you tell me to come down to Stockton if you know the part is not here!! All he said was sorry idk when itll be here. Day completely ruined because of this. DO NOT DEAL WITH FRANK!!!!</review>

<Gmap_id>0x809012659bc830c5:0xe98e7ac8a5f66a34< /Gmap_id><Name>Maggie< /Name><review>I called and spoke with Mr. Malloy who told me they had a radiator for us.  I asked him what the refund policy was.  Mr. Malloy said that the policy is all money is refunded without question within 30 days of purchase.  I had him tell me this twice, and I made it very clear to this Mr. Malloy that this is the radiator for my car, and that without it I cannot work, cannot make a living, so we really need to be clear on the terms.

So we go out to Stockton from Manteca, bring home the radiator, install it, find out that it does not work, oops my bad LKQ, even though they swore they had tested the thing, had not done so.  So go all the way back out to Stockton from Manteca to return the radiator and they refuse to give us our cash back, claiming that they only give refunds by check in 10 days.  So we have to go 10 days without a vehicle, without the ability to make a living, because these shysters refuse to refund the cash on the spot, like a normal, reputable business would do.

Stay away from these guys!  Horrible people, led by Mr. Malloy with his buddies Frank and Nestor completely backing up this scam.<//review><date>1524250106253<//date><UserId.>113898019636079200410< /UserId.>< Pics>

<text>Unbelievable... I purchased a Transmission from these Yahoos on Thursday Guaranteed to be here in Salinas Ca on Monday... Monday comes and Dale said Oops...it was sent to Los angeles.  Then tells me they screwed up and it doesnt have all its parts and that he is sending another one out of Bakersfield... Has 10K more miles... So today is Thursday (following Week) and still No Transmission.    Very Very Bad company to work with... Quick to take your money... SMOOTH talking ...  BAD Results Given.... Do your best to find your part ANYWHERE else.</text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

They have an interesting menu selection that's reminiscent of a Japanese izakaya. They have old favorites like croquette, chazuke and yaki onigiri as well as new choices, like a lobster maki and a cheese risotto. Definitely an interesting restaurant to check out!<//review>

<Text>After reading other peoples reviews about the food, I tried to lower my expectations so I won't be disappointed. Their food was good and I loved their service. Their cheese risotto is a must if you love cheese!!! It took a while for them to prepare it. My taste buds are still smiling :)

The atmosphere was very interesting. They were playing Mexican music every now and then, which cracked me up.<//Text><rate>4< /rate><username>Hanae K</username></record>

<Review>One of my favorite izakaya spots in Torrance.  Every dish is flavorful and the extensive menu offers something for everyone.  The cheese gratin is among the more popular dishes and worth trying if you like rich cheese.  Be sure to make a reservation in advance as seats are limited, fill up quickly, and people often stay long for drinks.  Portions are on the smaller side and prices can add up, but if you haven't tried this place, definitely give it a try.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dd4aa4c787a6f1:0x2ddf4a257fe6dcc7< /gmap_id></record>

“Favorite in the So Bay”
Charming local restaurant serving country French food. Large portions at reasonable prices and excellent service. Our favorites are the onion soup and the homemade pates to start. All the entrees are good especially the lamb chops.<//Text>

Even with reservations I typically have to wait a bit for my table to clear up.  Nothing I hold against the restaurants since some guests are inconsiderate and end up eating for way too long though I guess they could implement a time policy to help speed things along. There is also a hold up on food coming out of the kitchen just like most izakaya places.  But in the end the food here is delicious and the menu is very expansive.  The last trip the manager gave us a free pitcher to compensate for the long wait before getting seated.< /Text>< resp>

I spent two weeks in Japan in summer of 2013 and was looking for an LA sushi and seafood restaurant that could replicate what I had there. I tried many places before I found Musha, which is the closest I think you can come to that experience without an 11-hour flight.

Everything in Musha, from the menus to the seating arrangements (expect to take off your shoes before you go into the dining room) are traditional. The selection is short of sushi and favors more the small-portions plates commonly found in Japan.

All in all, it's the place to go to if you want a little slice of real Japan right here in Los Angeles.</Text>

I absolutely LOVE this place!  My fiance and I recently went for the first time after a recommendation from a friend and we were blown away.  I highly recommend the Aburi Sashimi that they light on fire at your table.  The service was amazing and the food was out of this world.

We will be back!</Text>

Quickie:
+ Intimate joint with a cool spin on Japanese cuisine
+ OMG the rissoto

---

Place:
Musha is definitely one of my most favorite restaurants in the Torrance area - I've went numerous times and have always left quite "ureshii." The place is on the cozier side but by no means inconveniently small... you can sit at the sushi bar, the booths and tables against the wall or the big family style table in the middle.

Food:
The food options are plentiful - I have had the Cheese Risotto and it's superbly delicious (doesn't hurt that it actually comes served in a whole wheel of cheese). I've tried the variations of sushi and desserts as have my friends and never has there been a poor review. Prices are pretty ordinary - nothing that will break the bank which is nice. Be daring and try anything - you won't be disappointed, I'm sure.

Overall:
It's not pajamas-and-house-shoes casual but you don't have to dress to the nines either - I love it. Need a nice restaurant to show off to out-of-town friends? Then, Musha is the place for you.<//review>

<review>I came here with colleagues for dinner on a Wednesday night. We had reservations which is key as this place is busy. Our waitress was really good, always around when needed but never intrusive. We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc she recommended and the price was good as was the wine.<//review>< date>

<Review>Musha is about as casual as Japanese dining can get. A communal table lets you make new friends (easier though if you speak Japanese).Order lots of small plates to share with some ice cold beer.<//Review></record>

< Review>
I came here with Gardenia H. and KW for a birthday dinner earlier this year. The restaurant is located in a large plaza so parking is plentiful. We got lucky and found a spot right in front of the restaurant. We had a reservation so we were quickly seated.

We shared the following:
-- TUNA POKE: Hawaiian style sashimi diced ahi tuna marinated with seaweed, garlic, sesame oil, citrus, wasabi, and soy sauce served with rice crackers
I do not eat raw fish, so I did not partake of this dish. Both Gardenia and KW liked it.
-- MUSHA'S FRIED CHICKEN: Chicken marinated with sake, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. Served with spicy grated daikon and ponzu sauce.
This did not look like what I thought it would look like. It looked more like chicken cutlet. The ponzu sauce was good but overall this dish was just okay. I wish they would rename this dish so people would have more realistic expectations (look at the picture. That is not what normal fried chicken looks like)
-- UDON VONGOLE: Asari (manilla clams) and assorted mushrooms sauteed with garlic, butter, sake and soy sauce. One of our East meets West dishes.
I have to say, based on the appearance I did not think I would care for this dish very much. So I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it. One complaint however is that the garlic flavour was very subtle (I love garlic and was hoping for a stronger flavour in this dish).
-- EBI MAYO MAYO: Spicy mayo glazed shrimp. Bite-size fried shrimp glazed with Musha's original sweet & spicy mayo sauce. With a texture and taste that will make you say "ahh~"
This was similar to the honey walnut shrimp you can get at Chinese restaurants. I really liked this dish--I love shrimp and it was prepared to be quite delicious here. It was served on a bed of salad, which I appreciated in this case because it helped offset all the mayo. Probably my favourite dish of the night.
-- MUSHA'S CHEESE RISOTTO: Italian dish with Japanese creation. Japanese grain brown rice cooked with chicken broth. Then panfried with bacon, onion, and a touch of heavy cream. Served in a whole cheese bowl to your table.
It is pretty cool that they bring out the risotto in a block of cheese, although it would have been even cooler if that is how they served it to us (the server scoops it into a bowl for the table). It was interesting since it was not the typical risotto rice used; it was also not as soft as I would like, but it was still good. However, would I get it again? Probably not.
-- BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM WITH BLACK HONEY AND SOY POWDER
This was a very interesting flavour. There was a crunchy topping which was nice... I'm glad we tried this out but I would probably not get it again.
-- CREAM BRULEE
I am not sure if the menu calling it "cream brulee" is a typo or not, because the dessert is very creamy so perhaps they were trying to be clever? I always love watching servers torch creme brulee at the table; creme brulee is my favourite dessert and I enjoyed it here. Always a wonderful way to end a meal.

Overall we enjoyed most of the food here and had a great time with good company. If you are in the area and the food I described sounds appealing, stop on by!</Review>

< Review>
Came here on a Saturday night when they first opened at 6. Apparently all the couple tables were reserved so my friend and I had to sit next to each other at the big communal table. We both wanted to get dinner before a movie nearby and I came here based off all the great yelp reviews. I was definitely disappointed.

We ordered:
the beef/potato croquette to start, followed by the fried chicken, beef tenderloin, and yaki onigiri.

The croquette was a special. It was really crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and lacked flavor. The clash of textures was a bit jarring and the overall dish was very disappointing.

The fried chicken was good. Not great, but just your standard fried chicken I guess. I felt pretty neutral about it - once again, I could have gone with more flavor.

The beef tenderloin is the only thing I would order again, although it was comparatively on the pricier side ($15).  It was well seasoned and cooked quickly on the grill to our liking - so I could only blame myself if I messed that up! The side sauce complimented it well.

The yaki onigiri is just what it sounds like - crispy fried brown rice without embellishments which worked well with the beef.

The meal ended with some complimentary tea.

Overall, the food was pretty bland and unimpressive. I will not be returning.<//Review>

Yet another solid recommendation from the ex-wife, Hanae K. She raved and raved about the cheese risotto that comes in a block of cheese. Of course I had to try check this out.

Other than the cheese risotto, we ordered the buta kakuni, the jidori chicken in yuzu sauce, ribeye skewers and the portabello mushroom with truffle oil. My favorite dish of the night were the mushrooms. We got to grill them on the table on a cute little charcoal grill and dipped them piping hot in the truffle oil.

The buta kakuni is very moist and tender. The jidori chicken is pretty good but I mostly only liked the crispy chicken skin. As for the risotto, they use a different rice that has a more substantial texture. It was delicious but the dish was quite heavy.

The ambiance is pretty casual. In fact, my sister, her bf, my bf, and I shared a large table in the center of the restaurant with several other parties. Luckily we got a corner seat so it wasn't too hard to have a conversation.

The service is pretty good but the food did take a while to come out, especially the risotto. The dish came last after we already finished everything else. They turn off all the lights and do this firing of the wok thing for a birthday too in case you want to come here for your birthday.< /Review>

<review>One of my favorite restaurants in the LA area. LOOOVE Musha!

The menu can seem daunting to those unfamiliar with Japanese tapas, but the staff is very friendly and full of recommendations. Here are my list of absolutely must tries:

- the cheese risotto, which is scooped out of a $400 chunk of parmigiano reggiano.
- french baguette stuffed with scallops and cheese
- beef tongue, lightly grilled and then sprinkled with salt and lemon juice

Dishes such as the ebi mayo mayo (much like the Chinese dish walnut shrimp), pork belly and the grilled chicken leg are also fantastic but not as imperative. I've tried mostly everything on the menu and so far nothing has been even slightly disappointing. It's roughly $5-7 a dish, so dinners come to about $20-30 a person.

Like most izakayas, the place is small and cozy, so make a reservation if you're planning on going during the weekend!< /review><user_name>Yvette Tung<//user_name>< Date>

<review>Yes, I know, I got there 19 hours prior to my delivery. But being rude is unacceptable. The guys at the receiving on 03.17.2021 at around 2030 was just impatient and did not even want to talk. All he said was "your appointment is at xyz, and it's busy". Well, as I was pulling in, the three only trucks that were there were leaving. Within 10 minutes, it was empty. Yet, he still would not get me unloaded.
P.S. Street parkings. Also, the gate closes at 0100.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

This place is complicit in committing fraud with it's "members" or "customers". They blamed their system but one of their members somehow got my wife's debit card information. They are acting like no crime was committed because the transaction was approved but they have their clients name who they admitted was a man and didn't bat an eye that he was using card information in a woman's name that was from Cleveland, Ohio. He said he has the person's name and video of him using the "card" but not sure how he managed to present a physical card. The person we spoke to was rude and seemed to be on the side of the person who committed the crime rather than the person he helped victimize. They will soon be visited by the Oakland police department and hopefully everything will be resolved but just be aware that if you do business with this store you.arw doing business with criminals who will not shy away from taking the entire contents of your bank account.<//review>

They don't follow appointment time. They have priority on certain loads, ignoring line and time when you checked in. 5 hours for 6 pallets, and they unloaded 3 trucks in front of me.<//text>

Great place to go if you're a cook a chef for somebody that does catering like me but I hate that if you don't actually have a business or big company they don't want to let you just come in there and spend your money that I think it's not cool but other than that great spot< /Text>

Try to call the manager and all they say is “sorry, we have to follow our processes”. It’s huge crowds and they won’t go open extra lines.
The manager won’t even leave his office when registers need to be opened.
Believe me, there is NO customer service.</Review>< pictures>

Good deals if you like to shop in bulk,  be ready to spend time in this store.  You will not find any customer support on the shopping floor,be careful not to get ran over her also.< /text>

You are very fortune if you get what you need, other than that their shelves are out of stock. They need to improve more in stocking because that is it all about business.</Text>

There are no disclosure about their return policy on any of the electronics they sell. Not on the receipts. Not on their store front display. By the time you try to return it, they said you only have 48hours. I even talked to the Branch Manager named Jonathan, he only gave me a "No" answered and walked away.
This is doing business not the American way. It seems like a Communist way like most other business in China and Vietnam I have to deal with. I never shop at this place ever again!</Text>< UserId.>

<user>103360691332098963895</user><Review>Horrible Customer Service. Cashiers way too slow, talking with co workers and walking around in the middle of a transaction. One cashier seems like she is out of it every time I see her. I waited in line with two people ahead of me for almost two hours. I asked management to improve their customer service but they didn't care to even listen.< /Review><user_name>Sanela Mlivo</user_name>< pictures>

Got a bike here yesterday, super friendly accommodating staff! The owner was so kind and helpful in explaining what would be a good fit for me and made sure to check the bike I picked that it was ready to ride out the door! If I'm needing any repairs I'd definitely go back</Text>

Casey(Sp?) in the Waldo costume helped us look for a bike she liked, let us test drive, and just answer all our questions, since this is our first non big-box store bike. Great experience, can't wait to pick up the bike in a week.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Thank you. The wheel you sold me wasn’t much more than if I bought it it on Amazon, but the two tools I would have needed to buy to fix my own would have doubled what it cost to have you guys do the work. You interrupted your other work to do this 10 minute fix. And you didn’t charge me the full labor costs. I appreciate your service and recommend your shop to anyone who needs bike help.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>At first they promised a bike then after the expected time for the order to be completed they still had not called. When asking them they said they did not have the bike. REALLY THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO TELL ME AFTER THREE DAYS. Anyways they changed the bike to a different color and waited 3 more days. FINALYY I HAVE MY BIKE AND ITS THE BEST THING EVER THANK YOU SO MUCH. I was mad but they made up for it and the bike was better then the one I originally wanted. I will be coming back for all my bike needs.< /review>< Pics>

Great shop! I needed a shifter for my MTB and they did not have one in stock so instead of making me wait to get it they took one off of a new bike on the floor. GREAT customer service! I will be making more purchases in the future from Eden Bikes!</Review>

Friendly and helpful neighborhood bike shop. I came in with a dodgy front rotor and the guys sorted me out. Had to make a quick call to Canyon to authorize the repair and the tech explained everything to the rep and I was out the door with a new rotor and ready to ride. Thanks guys!</review>

Stopped in while away from home for a quick tune up and they got me sorted better than ever expected. Highly recommend stopping in if you need a tune up. The techs here are absolute legends.< /Review>

I stumbled upon this bike shop in search of an electric bike and am so glad I did. Chris helped me order and assemble my dream bike and even delivered it to my house. I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and the service I received from Eden Bicycles, top notch!!<//Text>

<date>1536810786115< /date><rate>5</rate><text>(Translated by Google) It is a nice place and John is very kind, friendly and helpful. He is the boy who helped me with the service of my bike. He was very honest with his service as he told me what I really needed and what I didn't and by giving me suggestions and explanation of failures. Perhaps the price is a bit high but I think it is worth it for the treatment received and his effort to make himself understood with the little Spanish he handles and my little English that I speak. Nice job. Thanks a lot

Es un bonito lugar y John es muy amable, simpático y servicial. Es el muchacho que me ayudó con el servicio de mi bici. Fue muy honesto con su servicio ya que me dijo lo que realmente necesitaba y lo que no y al darme sugerencias y explicación de las fallas. Tal vez un poco alto el precio pero creo que lo vale por el trato recibido y su esfuerzo por darse a entender con el poco español que maneja y mi poco inglés que domino. Buen trabajo.

Love the grooming salon here! My pup is super comfortable with the staff and she tends to have a timid personality since she's a rescue. They always make her feel welcome and she comes out looking beautiful and clean. Also big shoutout to Bailey O. for being an THE BEST groomer! My dog loves her!!<//review>

They have the best customer service around.  I have never had a problem they couldn't solve! But the best part is that every person working there genuinely loved animals and it shows!< /Text>

PetSmart PB was as accommodating as usual. One current deal I used was the buy more price knock-off for Friskies canned cat food. I love the place when rabbits are available for adoption. And the fish selection is wonderful and soothing to watch. Very young children love wandering along the tanks at the back of this store.< /Text>

< Review>
They never followed instructions.
My dog showed up with a cut on his neck for 3 times in a roll.
My bill always comes strange amounts, even tho i always use(d) the same services. One of their managers are nasty and charged 35 dollars because i was late 10 minutes on the pick up time and it was not even their time to close..anyways, I will look and i recommend you to look elsewhere.<//Review>

I needed a big amount of cat litter for a small price for my 4 cats. I found a sale for 35 lbs. of Great Choice scoopable litter for $10 at Pet Smart in Pacific Beach!! It IS a Great Choice! I need a 2nd 35 lb. tub! Hope sale still on! So close to home, too.< /text>

Me, my son, and my dad went to this petsmart on 8/11/19 around 5pm to adopt a kitten and we had the best service and such an easy process ever!! We adopted a kitten named kristoff and we love and adore him!! I would definitely reccomend this place for kitten adoption if you were looking to adopt a cat or kitten!! I had such a nice cashier that help with the whole thing I hate I dont remember her name! But she was really nice!!< /text>

Otherwise their mealworms are very healthy i bought a zoomed clamp lamp there and it works just fine with the bulbs that are in there.<//Review><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc01c0bd4c0449:0x994e0aae8e6ddb4< /GmapID>< pics>

<Review>I try not to go there since it opened but online it said they had a certain cat tree. They didn't. They had hardly any...back of the store at the side. What major chain doesn't carry cat trees. This store has no customer service. In fact, you will be hard pressed to find a clerk. Not to mention it is very hot in the store. I left in a hurry and went "next door"< /Review><Date>1524893011752< /Date>< UserId.>

Everyone here is very nice and helpful...we get crickets, worms and accessories here for our leopard gecko,  plus they always have kittens and bunnies :)
Avoid PetCo next to Vons...that's the worst pet store ever.< /Text>

I am a long time petsmart customer with 3 animals that get groomed, boarded, supplied with any pet supplies needed and even go to the vet there. Yesterday I went in the purchase my cats food ideal balance by hills, a brand I also use for my dogs. Both this petsmart and the petco nearby had nearly no selection of that food left.. The sales representative on the floor asked me if I needed help, when I told him what I was looking for in the ideal balance brand he proceeded to tell me that brand was phasing out completely and offered me a half off coupon for some brand I've never heard of and when I politely declined and said I would probably just get my cat science diet since it's similar and made by the same company, not to upset her stomach but that I needed to look into it more and talk to her vet. He then proceeded to tell me that science diet by hills "is doing a lot of downsizing as well" so discouraged I decided to go home and research what is really going on with these two brands...  It turns out that neither brand is "phasing out" or "doing a lot of downsizing" the reason they are not carrying these two foods by hills is "due to a business issue". Petsmart and petco should make that clear to their customers when they come in looking for their pets food that more then likely the pet has been on for years and not tell them some bullshit reason why they aren't carrying the brand anymore making the customer think they need to switch their pets food entirely, which is a stressful delicate process. It should be about the wellbeing of the pet and not about the sales numbers.<//Text>

< Review>
Authentic Guatemalan tamales as good as my grandmothers! Bought a dozen of both chicken and pork tamales. The meat was tender and flavorful but the sauce (recado) was out of this world! It's like a burst of all the right Guatemalan seasonings!

Highly recommend to order in advance because they quickly run out for the day. I placed my order by phone and the lady's had everything ready for me to quickly pay and go!<//Review>

I have had the breakfast and the chicken soup here on several occasions and I'm never disappointed. Fresh hand made tortillas and salsa very tasty. When ever I'm in the area I'm sure to stop by. Very good food.<//Text>

This restaurant it used to be the best in the area for pupusas and chicken soup. Last time I got old chicken soup. The salsa for pupusas is not salsa and the cabbage doesn't have vinager or oregano. I'm not going back here.☹️☹️<//Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Jay Cee</Name><review>I give it 1 star because of the customer service. The manager is really nice and does what she can to please you but she isnt there all the time. The lady that is there most of the time when the manager isnt there is sooooooooooooooo SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO rude. But I mean RUDE A.F I only go there for 1 thing. I always order it the same way and she always gives me a HARD TIME. She always said, I cant make it because the manager isnt here to tell the cooks. I mean come on guys, it's just taking red meat off and putting chicken.  THATS IT! How hard is it to do that. Im not asking for nothing for free, I'm a paying customer and I tip all the time even when im picking up. But on another note, the food is good, just not the customer service. OWNER, MANAGER PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LADY.</review>< Rating>

I've been here in a couple of occasions and in both days I saw cucarachas not just on the wall but right at the register, the cashier just smiled and continued at this point I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay or just to cancel my order<//text>

Dine in Salvadorean plates and bakery open early. We had the papusas and pollo con crema and they were delicious! I was confused about the dining arrangement, but you pay at the front and they bus you for everything.<//review>

We are very pleased with Jacot Plumbing!  Matt was on time, answered my questions, and worked on installing sink faucet and handles on two of our bathroom sinks, and installed handheld shower heads on two of our showers.  When there was a slight issue with a sink, Matt knew exactly what to do and it was fixed as soon as the part was available.</review>

<text>Chuck with Jacot Plumbing was professional & did everything at such a great price we were telling all our friends. He didn't try to upgrade us & gave us a great estimate upfront. I had a long list of needed repairs for our bathroom. When our sink plugged up. I was now forced to find a plumber that could tackle my long list. Our old plumbing company went out of business & I did my research. Lucky me I found Jacot Plumbing. They are better than great! They are Awesome!</text>< Pictures>

He then called the steam guy (leakage was from steam equipment) to find out what is the reason and how can it be fixed. He was at my place for over an hour and performed all necessary actions. Also asked me to call him if there is any issue again. So glad and satisfied with the service. Will call again if I need help with any other issues. Thanks Jesse!</review>< GmapID>

<Review>I have used Jacot Plumbing for a couple of years now. They repaired a toilet drainpipe and installed a new toilet. Two bathroom faucets. Kitchen sink faucet. Bathroom manifold and shower set. Installed new Water heater and water heater flush. I’ve had several different Jacot plumbers at my house and they are all nice, informative, arrive on time, clean up and complete a superb job.< /Review>< userid>

<Text>I have used Jacot for years, for both small and large problems. I was referred to them by a family friend, who also happens to be a Real Estate Agent and praised them highly for their diligence and dedication. I've had them repair my water main (very large repair/task), snake clogged drains, install clean outs (another larger job) and a few days ago, clear the clogged kitchen drains. They're professionals, courteous, personable and always there when you need them. A reliable plumbing service is one of those "must haves" for any property owner and Jacot is the company to rely on.</Text>< rating>

Jacot Plumbing was sent out by my insurance company to assess a plumbing issue. Charles was great and respectful of the current COVID-19 situation by wearing a mask, etc. He was thorough in his inspection and reached out to my insurance company immediately after leaving my home. He even asked me how I was doing on supplies as he said they carry stuff in the truck should their customers need anything! I was good on everything except TP... so he was kind enough to give me a couple of rolls!!!

Great service, timely, professional and caring!! Would recommend them and use them again in the future.<//Review>

Have used Jacot plumbing service 3 times since we moved to Garden Grove. Each time I asked them to come out to check out a problem, they always gave me a fast answer and always showed up on time. Technicians that have worked at my home are courteous and professional. They take their time to explain the problem and how to resolve it. Would recommend Jacot to anyone who has plumbing issues.<//Text>

The Jacot staff are always friendly and provide great results! Jacot Plumbing will always be my go-to company for all of my plumbing needs.

I have no idea how this business has 5 stars. My mom who's 75 called them to help with some plumbing problems we had while trying to install a new washer and dryer. They charged her $50 to come out and assess the situation, $45 for a new hose (that she won't need) . All this was on a Friday, and they told her they will be back on Monday with equipment to see if they will be able to resolve the problem. When they showed up on Monday, they came just to tell her in person they would not be able to do the job. What was this? A company taking advantage of an elderly person who does not know about home repairs. Extremely upset with them. With so many great plumbers don't take your chances!.<//review>

< Review>
Subs and Spuds is a quiet little sub diner in the Canyon Crest Plaza. While not luxury, the food was fantastic and well proportioned. For a regular sub (+avo) a medium drink, and a HUGE loaded potato, the total was 18.22. So while it can lean on the pricey side, the quality of the food and the friendliness of the shop more then make it worth it. Stop by for lunch.</Review>

delicious hot sandwiches, I had to get a small chicken pesto panini and it was everything I wanted and more to go with my fluffy hot baked "taco" potato. Do NOT change that salsa recipe it's the best house salsa i've ever had! I was also so please to see all the EXTRA precautions they are taking to keep customers and themselves safe during this pandemic. Please support this business!</Text>

<text>Great little spot for lunch.  Lots of options for everyone in your group.  The subs contain a good amount of meat and the bun is not bad.  The salad which sadly I did not get looked delicious.  My friend had the potato and said it was good.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if you are in the area go ahead and consider this a lunch option.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcafb16f09c7cd:0xc4a890d5cab5e902</gmapID>< Response>

I was having a bad day and I walked in asking for the cheapest thing on the menu. The man who owned the store introduced himself and talked to me about my day. He gave me a free sandwich with my potato salad. Both of which were great. Food is great and the customer service is even better. Highly recommend.<//Text>

Loved the food and the service.  Not a fan of the hours though.  Went back for my second visit during the open hours listed online and found it closed (for what I don't know).  I would still recommend this place, but I would advise anyone to go as early as possible since they seem to close early on Saturdays.< /review>

I do have sensitive ears so I asked my friend and she thought it was a little loud.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Patty Paffrath< /user_name><user>103561284753315973236< /user></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Ate here for the first time.  I really did enjoy it, I got the italian on white, my daughter got a bacon bit and sour cream potato and my son got a chili cheese potato.  My sandwich was very good, not dry or lacking in flavor.  The portions of meat were perfect for me.  All in all it was a nice light sandwich perfect for the warm weather.  I did not try the bacon bit potato but I think it may be my daughters her favorite.  The chili cheese potato was heavy, but what do you expect?  It had good flavor and was a cool twist on chili cheese fries.  I will definitely come back for lunch but I think that for dinner it might not be enough.<//review>

Cute and clean establishment. Ice cream puff sandwich was pretty tasty and the mango sorbet was on point. Their flavors were delicious and hard to choose from. The staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely return!<//Text>

<review>This place has such unusual ice cream flavors, but each one I've tried has been good. You can get whatever flavor you choose on a fluffy donut or add a churro to it.  It's the ultimate treat and the place my kids beg to go to when were out for dessert.</review></record>

<Text>Edit: we had the puffs today. Delicious! Changing review to 4 stars now that I’ve been able to taste it.

I want to give this place 5 stars but it’s a little hard to do that when they don’t have the item they are known for...you know - the one the place is named for - ice cream PUFFS. Just drove 10mi to treat my kids only to find out the puff shipment didn’t arrive today. Total let down. What’s next? Subway is out of sandwiches? All I’m saying is call ahead before you go!!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Their shakes are really good but I'd skip the over the top donut and churro versions. You have to be very specific about any mix-ins or toppings you want because they don't ask you before they start.  Not to be "that person" but their pictures vs the product you get is not accurate at all. I expect that from large chain places, but was surprised that was the case for a more boutique dessert place. They were sort of just thrown together, but the shake itself was really good. The girls working seemed annoyed by asking for samples (I had two) and answering questions.

Tables were sticky and the places where the boards came together were filled with gunk. I'd suggest getting your dessert and taking it elsewhere.</review>

Delicious unique ice cream flavors & toppings.  The "puffs" are glazed donuts made fresh cut open & ice cream, plus toppings in middle.  Cute shop</Text>

I was gobsmacked to learn that they serve Gunther 's  Ice Cream, here. I've  been to Gunther' s iconic Ice Cream Shoppe in Sacramento,  CA. where they hand churn their unique flavors & creamy deliciousness. It's nice to have Gunther's fabulous flavors, right here in Anderson, CA. a perfect stop on a  triple digit day, to cool off!</Review>

Wide variety of tasty ice creams and fresh churros definitely give the fruity pebbles churros a try! Would have liked more non-dairy options with mango sorbet being the only choice at the time, other than that was a great visit.< /text>

Heard of this place and finally got around to trying it. Clean establishment with friendly staff. My mom and I shared an ice cream puff. We had the "Everything But The" which was caramel ice cream with pretzels and fudge. Delicious ice cream flavor that wasn't too rich and held up well even with the added sugar from the donut...I probably wouldn't eat one myself but it was good. I think the prices for the other creations are kind of expensive. However the price for toppings is only 75 cents and it's unlimited.

I'm from Red Bluff so I won't be going out of my way to try this place again. But if I'm stopping through Anderson and want a dessert, I would consider this place again.< /review>

They lacked hospitality, I was turning in a resume and was also going to buy an ice cream. I had called to ask the manager if it was a good time to come in and he said yes. I came professionally dressed, and I was very polite. As I walked through the door I could tell the girl behind the counter and the girl on the floor were both going to lack personability and were not welcoming in any way. On two gentle attempts to speak to the manager, they did not allow me to meet him. They didnt say more than one sentence to me and raised their eye brows in false sympathy for the lack of communication. I was looking forward to getting an ice cream and making light conversation with them, but as a potential employee OR a customer, it was hand in hand a bad experience and I left feeling unwanted and uncomfortable.</text>

<Text>I don't normally like a lot of sweets and I have been told this is to much sweets.WRONG.these donuts filled with ice cream are amazing lots of different flavors and lots of toppings to choose from . I gave it 4 stars only because toppings need to be displayed better.</Text><Date>1527999882731</Date><Rate>4<//Rate><response>None< /response><user_id>116019377171253890121<//user_id>< Gmap_id>

<Review>From a friend; the story of this incident has to be shared.

Tonight I spent the evening with my 14 year old daughter at a painting class, and after decided to go get ice cream at The Parlor in Anderson. We have always enjoyed going to get ice cream there because be love the flavor selection, and who doesn't love ice cream with a donut? As we were sitting eating our ice cream inside I started to listen to the music they were playing and I couldn't believe what I was hearing, they were playing very offensive rap music. The song was talking about F***ing B**ches, N**gers smokin' Sh**.  So as some of you may know, I sometimes have a hard time keeping comments to myself, and had made several comments about how this was not appropriate music for a business, and that I thought this was a family environment. None of the staff cared about how they were offending customers, not only me but another couple also. So my daughter and I quickly ate our ice cream and left as quickly as possible. So needless to say the owner and/or manager will be getting a phone call from me tomorrow.<//Review>< pictures>

This was my 1st time in the office. Dr Beckley  fit me into his tight schedule for a consult on follow up care for my broken jaw. He has a great bedside manner and was patient in answering all my questions. The staff was very friendly and the office nice and comfortable. I feel fortunate to have connected with this office and feel confident that I am getting.the best care.<//text>

As a mom I am always nervous about my children having procedures. Although this time my son is an adult I still worry the same. They are always so kind and answer all of my questions. My son will be getting his wisdom teeth out and I am so glad that he is in good hands!< /Review>

<user_id>115382530447422410997< /user_id><Review>After going through an experience that was the thing nightmares are made of, I was more than anxious to walk into another dental office (surgeon). Dr. Beckley and his staff far exceeded any expectations I had.  The office is professional but not intimidating, the staff is warm and friendly- sensitive without feeling condescending. Dr. Beckley was kind, thorough and extremely knowledgeable about my specific circumstances. I can’t say enough good things about my whole experience and am only upset I didn’t go to them first.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

I am not a fan of any dental work and try to always put it off. I can not thank Pacific Oral and Facial Surgery Center enough. They immediately made me feel comfortable and calm all my nerves down. I highly recommend Dr. Beckley and all of his nursing staff working along side of him.<//text>

Our experience was fantastic from the consultation to the day of surgery. The Doctor and staff are extremely thorough in explaining everything. Our daughter has extreme anxiety being on the spectrum and there was no problem whatsoever! They offered such great comfort. They also have great measures in place for the extra safety of COVID. I highly recommend them. We will use them in the future for our son as well. I cannot thank them enough for our great success!</Text>

This was one of the best experiences. Dr. Beckley and his staff were outstanding. Dr. Beckley called me in the evening to see how I was doing. The staff also called me in the evening also. The staff also called me the next week to see how I felt and if I needed anything. This is how an office should be ran. They are the Best! Everyone should take an example of how their office is ran.< /Text>

Dr. Beckley’s office followed perfect covid protocol. They were efficient, professional & service oriented. The office was spotless, had nice esthetics and was ahead of schedule on the day we were there. The doctor himself was pleasant, did not seem to be in a rush and answered all our questions about my daughters wisdom teeth removal procedure. I would highly recommend this office. Thx for the great service.</Review>

<Review>The procedure went perfect.  No complaint there.  I had to pay $3000 up front then after waiting to be reimbursed by insurance was told that half the charges were denied in pre cert and the procedure was done anyways.  I was never informed this.  Now I’m in fight with insurance and provider to get this money back.  Not cool.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

In these times of COVID, I was very impressed with the flow, maintenance and attention to safety provided by both Dr Beckley and his staff.  At most, there was only one other person in the area at the time.  Masks were enforced.  Entry and controlled.  Cleaning seemed to be adequate.  We unfortunately needed to visit 4 times.  The initial consult, the procedure and two follow ups.  Each time, I appreciated their attention to detail.  Great job!<//review>

Very friendly and attentive staff once you enter. Before being seen, was notified of amount that I was needed to pay for the consultation that my insurance would not cover( I thought that was thoughtful and informative for me to best decide if I wanted to be seen). Dr. Vandersloot was friendly and explained everything in detail to help me understand how my procedure would be. Upon leaving, Anjelica at the front was super nice and helpful in scheduling my next visit. Would highly recommend,  top notch facility with excellent staff.< /Review>

This was the first time my elderly mother had ever come to Pacific Oral & Facial Surgery Center.
We appreciated the hospitality provided by all the staff. My mother felt comfortable and at ease with everyone working with us. Having been called later n the afternoon by their office only confirmed even more how much care there is for their patients. I highly recommend Pacific Oral & Facial Surgery Center in Tracy.< /Text>

The staff, including the doctor (which is rare) were warm, welcoming and made you feel like you were the most important person in the entire office. They offered bottled water and blankets while you waited for the doctor and staff kept you engaged in conversation to keep you from being nervous. When it came time for the procedure, the doctor kept talking to me as he was getting ready (I'm assuming to know when the medication had kicked in enough for him to start) and it was so comforting. I am a very nervous person at the dentist office and with all the staff being so engaging, I didnt even get a chance to think about being nervous. The next day, I hardly had any pain and I'm sure it was because the doctor and staff were not in a rush during my procedure. I LOVED this office!</Text>

< Review>
Great time.

I’m a giant baby and petrified of needles. They provided me with a prescription for a mild sedative but I have no idea if it worked or not. Either way, the procedure seemed to go just fine; I was asleep the whole time though so I can’t exactly give many details.

This is actually my second procedure there. First was for a bone graft and it was similarly painless (pun intended?). Dr. B took the time to explain the procedure to me and answered all my questions. Soooorta left off the part about there being a screw in my face at the end of the procedure which I didn’t actually know about until a subsequent x-ray but it’s all good.

Five stars and zero complaints. Receptionists even laughed at my bad jokes!< /Review>

Dr. Beckley is amazing!  He did an extraction on one of my teeth and also removed my son's wisdom teeth.  Everything was done flawlessly with a quick recovery--it was as pleasant as a surgery could be!  His team is also wonderful--very kind, caring and professional.

I wish I could give the office and staff 5 stars and review the doctor separately.  The staff is friendly and VERY knowledgeable.  From the appointment to the woman who did my consultation to the woman who did my insurance estimate...all AMAZING!  The doctor was rushed...with him I was just a number...another procedure.  He was abrupt and actually looking at the door as he spoke VERY briefly with me as if he needed to get on to the next job.  I had no time to even think of questions much less ask them. I really think the staff need to find a new doctor.  Again...too bad.  The office staff and other professionals are 6 star worthy.< /text>

<text>Dr. Beckley was very clear and concise about the procedure (molar removal). The whole staff at the office were friendly and courteous. They do a follow up to make sure everything is okay. Would definitely recommend .< /text><user_name>R D.< /user_name><userid>110975316605586380313<//userid>< resp>

The entire Team at Pacific oral and facial surgery center in Livermore ...are the best!
From scheduling appointments,
to the consultations, and of course the surgery and follow up have made me feel informed, prepared, and comfortable!
I will recommend them to everyone I know!
Thank you< /review>

Entire experience here is great. My situation felt considered carefully, and they worked with my orthodontist to come up with a plan. Couldn't be better.

Update - three surgeries later I can confirm my original statement! Exceptional team.<//text>

My husband needed a molar extracted and Pacific Oral in its entirety made the whole experience professionally comfortable.  They even called that evening to check in and make sure how he was doing.  Great personal touch and highly suggested.<//review>

My 2nd grader needed a tooth extraction.  Dr. Beckley and the staff were patient, polite, and very helpful.  My little guy was nervous but they made the experience seamless.  Don't hesitate to visit this practice.</Text>

4 is for CA opening up for business for indoor seating.   However,  only outdoor seating.   No bathrooms open.   Prepay at front for everything.   Otherwise, food is good.< /text>

Visited this restaurant today for mother day brought my 69 year old mother out to eat my brother and a couple others joined so we got to the front asked for a party of six they said it’ll be four hours because they do not have a lot of big tables he can split the tables i asked for a table of five the host said four or less so i booked a table for two and my brother booked a table for four once our wait time came my mother sat down for the table of two and another family member i waited for the table of four the tracker on yelp went from a wait time of 1hr  to we will be contacted by the host i waited four and a half hours for the next table of four when we were getting ready to be seated they said we could go around the back for seating another host said something to the first host then they stated we couldn’t sit in the back we had to sit in the front because the table of two my mother was at sat in the back and we couldn’t be all together  so my other family members decided not to stay myself and my mother decided to stay and my other four family members left so now thats just the table of two my mother & I stayed at the table they sat her at then the host came to the back  said we have to leave because we didn’t follow policy i asked what policy we didn’t follow the host stated we didn’t sit where they wanted us to sit my mother started to explain she was sat here by someone and this is where she had been the host stated that we wasn't supposed to sit there and had to go they could refuse service so myself and my mother went home after paying for parking for four hours & didn’t receive service wasted over four hours< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1612134549166, 'text': "I'm sorry about your experience. You do not have to tip before getting your food. There is a option on the kiosk to leave a tip if you like, but definitely not required. Do to Covid restrictions, we currently are not doing dining service and everything is in disposable/takeout containers. We have provided tables and chairs for those that want to sit at a table, however we are not doing dining services. Hopefully you try us again when we do go back to full service dining and have a better experience with a actual server. Again we apologize for the inconvenience and misunderstanding."}</Resp><review>Be forewarned, you are required to order and pay for your meal, AND THE TIP, prior to being seated. This wouldn’t be a problem if the service and food were up to par, however neither are. We literally never saw our waitress for our entire meal. When we finally were able to flag down the other waitress at the end of our meal, we were informed that they were out of the lemonade we had originally ordered so it couldn’t be refilled. We were forced to settle for water. A decent restaurant would have offered this water for free since they couldn’t accommodate our refills. However, this dump sought to charge us an additional $1 per glass! This on top of the $190 we were spending to feed the two of us. We were told the only one who could get around this charge was our original waitress, but since she wasn’t available...
The worse dining experience possible!< /review>< time>

Great view of the water if you luck up on a back patio seat! Everything is so good here. I've had everything from fried frog legs to crayfish etuofee.  King Crab with potatoes, corn and andouille sausage. Not to mention the huge mixed drinks, to live for. A must try!!</review>

<Rate>3</Rate><username>Jaleisha Jacobs</username><text>I ate here with my children a two weeks ago. I was very excited to visit Louisiana Charlie’s because my family is from southern Louisiana and I love the cuisine. It was more expensive than I expected it to be. The price of lunch for the three of us was over $80 for gumbo fries, catfish, and a children’s pasta. The small boxed apple juice for my 4 year old daughter was $4 or $5. The catfish was really good! The gumbo fries were just okay. Definitely a cool concept and I wanted to like them, but they looked better than they tasted. Be mindful when ordering the gumbo fries, it’s a lot of food. It could easily feed 4 hungry adults.<//text>< gmapID>

Ordered chicken barbecue which is the WORST tasting bbq I have ever had in my 57 yrs of life. Costco chicken tasted better. Spent almost $20 to a tiny size half. My daughter's burger ok. It wasn't juicy. Water wasn't free.  And sadly, waitresses did not even ask if we needed validation, like other friendly restaurants do.  It was our first time in this location and without validation, parking ticket would cost $8 for under 2 hours. We paid in advance through their app  prior to  dining so we paid gratuity ahead of  POOR service. Not recommending this place and never going back.<//review>

<review>I selected the  wrong sides  the manager came out when I questioned where my sides were. She was not friendly just rude n dry offered to charge for the correct sides. The chicken wings were the worst wings I've ever ordered. The 1/2 chicken was dry n over cooked. Restaurant is overrated and priced not definitely going back. Ribs were just ok.<//review>< pictures>

Omg I love this place!!!! I saw my cousin and his wife post this food every Sunday, finally I asked his wife where was this food from. She told me Louisiana Charlie’s in Long Beach. I took my husband there for his bday two years ago. We got the gumbo nachos.....oh my, good good good, and it can actually feed about four people. We also ordered the ribs plate for him and I got a shrimp po boy. I must say that the food was as good as it looked. If you don’t do anything else, pleeeeeeeeeease try this place, you will love it, and the view outside was nice.</text>

Can you just say amazing. Now I was born in Inglewood and raised in New Orleans due to college #DillardUniversityALUM!!! I DIGRESS... This restaurant here is a hidden GEM. I always eat at tequila Jack's, and everything at the beginning of shoreline village a that I never knew this was there. I'm grateful for my mom and her recommendation to bring my friend from Dallas.

<text>The service at this place is extremely terrible. They didn't even take our order and we waited for 45 mins before we could flag someone down. Or server switched tables and didn't let us know. The food we had was decent. The fries appetizer was really good but the rack of ribs we ordered were dry. Will probably not come back here because of the terrible service.</text><rate>1</rate><Time>1552792630752<//Time>< Resp>

I absolutely loved this place. I had crawfish etouffee, frog legs, yes you read right,  FRIED FROG LEGS, and an awesome drink called Coronita. The food tasted amazingly good. This was the first time I had frog legs and I would totally recommend it. Try something new! Live life! They also have alligator. The staff was very helpful and was willing to accommodate my request to sit outside. Highly suggest you visit this restaurant when you're in Long Beach!<//Review>

<Review>A local resident of Long Beach suggested that we eat here if we were interested in a local restaurant outside of a chain restaurant. I ordered the catfish plate with beans and macaroni and cheese. Our server was very informative about the menu and suggested that most people get their catfish fried vs blackened. I actually was not a fan of the baked beans, but the catfish and macaroni and cheese tasted fine.</Review>< Rating>

I adore this spot! They serve marvelous dishes, their menu is nice, The chef in that restaurant is a specialist, I like a lot trying all their food. The dishes are consistently fresh, the attitude towards the guests  is friendly. I often go to  this place and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend it to all my friends.<//Review>

Just walking in front of this restaurant you get a chance to see the great seafood choices available at this restaurant. Fresh crabs, lobster, fish amongst other fabulous dishes. You won’t be disappointed. Large portions, great meal choices and fresh area food just have a little patience as it’s seems to have a good client following an has a little wait to be seated. Moderately priced and perfect for large groups.</Text>

The food is definitely worth the trip.  I ordered the Bayou Blackened shrimp with Yams& Mash potatoes.  The Shrimp were really tasty and adding fresh lemon added to it.  The yams were sweet and delicious and the mash potatoes were good but if they added some gravey it would make them that much better.  Mac & Cheese needed a little more seasoning but descent. My friend ordered the Gumbo and I tried it and it was good.  The service was Excellent and they were on top of it.  The servers help one another so i think I had about 3 servers. Definitely plan on coming back and the back patio is a Great the view is Amazing<//Review>

The food is but the service is just a little shaky. When I ask for tartar sauce they never brought it out but they would bring other things out that other people ask for. Other than that I do have to say the food is good you will enjoy it<//text>

This place makes up for all the bad Creole,  Cajun food that I have had. They are spot-on  with their dishes and spices. My parents and grandparents are from Louisiana and the food i grew up on had to be right. I stopped going to these types of restaurants because they are just not good! My daughter swears by this place and of course she wanted to shop along with her mother. So, I gave it a try and I was just blown away.  Everything that came to the table was excellent. The spices, hospitality and atmosphere was about as perfect as perfect could be. I have a thing that I want my food Extremely hot when it comes to the table. Of course most places wont do it because they don't want to be sued. I get it! No real problem there but without even asking, my food was piping HOT!  I think my family and I ordered about everything on the menu. Our waitress, I forget her name, I believe it was Katie. I hope I'm right. She was very thorough about the menu and shared her thoughts on what we ordered. My grandson got the corn dogs. He's only two. He demolished them. If you want a great Cajun, Creole meal, hit this place. I rented a tandem bicycle and took a ride before our table was ready. I hope they never change. The only bad thing was the teas. I'm not a fan of sweet tea but the family enjoyed them. The place fills up pretty quick. My daughter made the arrangements so I dont know if they take reservations.< /text>

My waitress was actually helpful and communicated better than the manager with my concerns. I order the shrimp and crab fajitas that’s why I come here because they are the best. Tonight was not the night at all the food was not good at all. I did not want to make a big deal about it but honestly the crab tasted like a salt stick. I just wanted to enjoy my food by getting a new batch but accordingly to the manager I could not get a new batch. She was only concerned about the refund policy to really take the time to understand it wasn't the money at all I wanted my food still. Clearly I still paid 100 for food I never ate. I would most definitely take it up with someone higher. Sorry Charlie tonight was not y’all night!</Review>

To start off I love the spare ribs and the potato salad from this restaurant. My boyfriend tried the seafood fajita and it was very salty. What I did not like was the wait time to receive your food. In addition I also did not like that on the weekend they do not do to go orders. I mean that business model makes no sense! I've never heard of a restaurant not doing to go orders on any day and also if the wait is long to get a table there should be quicker options made available to people if they want it no matter the day. The manager and staff should work on that. People also want quality food and not a plate full of salt, maybe do a taste test before putting out dishes to ensure its seasoned properly. I'm from NY so this California way of service is also taking some getting used to. Customer service is key.< /text>

Great food like always. The drinks are so big and delicious. The only thing was the service was ok and  I feel the food was rushed due to it being close to closing time. Nonetheless the experience was pleasant.< /review>

<Text>My service there was nice, but after I receive my order it was not want I order and I took it back the manager said too bad because they are not able to do returns.  I said but this is not what I order at all. The order was a half rack of baby backs which they gave me regular spare ribs and besides that the ribs were tuff. So this is not a place that I would dine ever again.< /Text>< pictures>

The atmosphere of this establishment is casual and pleasant. My partner and I were seated immediately and were greeted by our extremely helpful waiter shortly after. The menu provides a lot of amazing options from Gumbo fries to Half pound burgers and Ribs (almost too many great options to choose from).

Having been my first time here I played it safe and ordered the fried catfish and chicken basket with cajun fries with a side of mac n cheese. Although a little pricey, the basket was AMAZING. After the meal I ordered a banana pudding that came in a cute little mason jar. Although it was absolutely amazing, I believe the pricing of the dessert was much too costly for the amount of actual dessert.

Overall, I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you’re looking for a decent Cajun style and bbq meal. However, I would recommend asking the waiter for prices in advance if you dont see a price on the menu or else you might be in for a surprise (as I was for the banana pudding).< /text>

Just walking in front of this restaurant you get a chance to see the great seafood choices available at this restaurant. Fresh crabs, lobster, fish amongst other fabulous dishes. You won’t be disappointed. Large portions, great meal choices and fresh area food just have a little patience as it’s seems to have a good client following an has a little wait to be seated. Moderately priced and perfect for large groups.</Text>

<username>Ricky Wood< /username><Text>While walking by, I smelled the BBQ out front and instantly knew I was going to eat here. I didn't realize it was more of a Louisiana cuisine. They only have a few BBQ items. I thought the half rack of baby back ribs with sides would be enough for my gf and I.. and it would have been. I let the server talk me into a full rack with an extra side. We couldn't eat half of it. Speaking of the service, our server and every other employee were super friendly and helpful. Also, we both had bad stomach aches after eating this.</Text>< time>

Everything was fresh. I went with a group of ten and we all was tasting each others food. Even the green bean and collards was delicious unbelievable. The only thing that wasn't good was the spinach dip. Totally disgusting The peach tea was just right. The prices were moderate. Just expect a long wait. Ps I went on a Sunday so that might have contributed to the wait time. Definitely going back.<//text>

<review>Food was good. Waitress (Destiny) was terrible. The manager did her best to help when she was available. Appetizer got there quick (bout 20 minutes after seating). Alcohol got there 20 minutes later (both were ordered at the same time) napkins and silverware arrived 10 minutes after the appetizer at which point we asked for waters since our drinks hadn't arrived. Waters finally arrived after being there for 50 minutes courtesy of the manager.

Food is good if you're willing to put up with terrible service.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd3125a9e69a1f:0xcfc003a01c5bb266</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Amazing bbq chicken. Great atmosphere. Music not too loud, but just right. I heard disco, funk and I liked it. Finished off my experience with a banana caramel pudding. It was so good. The chicken melted apart when I ate it.. it was that good too. Collard greens were superb, nice and hot, not too salty. Mashed potatoes were done well. Had a turbo dog beer for my first time, nice dark beer, which I like!<//Text>< Pics>

OMG!!!! We sat outside enjoying the most beautiful Independence Day, the weather was perfect. The staff is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The drinks are large, potent and delicious. We had a Hurricane and Drunk in Love. I totally 100% recommend the Drunk in Love, it's the drink with a bottle of Champagne tossed in, Vodka and fresh Strawberries Oh Baby!!! That's good stuff. We shared the Gumbo Fries, Gumbo fries??? YES, ridiculously good, full of flavor and we still had some left over to take home. The shrimp were large and buttery cooked to perfection.  Ok so the only drawback, we were soooooo full I didn't get to order anything else. Smart move for Charlie now I have to go back (SOON) and try a Shrimp Po Boy and of course have another Drunk in Love!!!!!</Review>

Great server Jasmine. Horrible manager. She is on a power trip. I travel the world and ate at numerous restaurants. The manager is usually the trained one who should be a leader in customer service. In this situation Ally the (manager) was just on a power trip and assumed that we the customer also work for her.</Text></record>

<review>This place is the business... the food is delicious😋 my family took me there for Mother’s Day and I really enjoyed my self. It was a wait but what do you expect when the food is so delicious and everybody is trying to get in...  I give kudos to this business because they are doing a great job!  I am  a  Creole woman and I know good Cajun food. I had  The fried catfish, yams and sweet corn that was the best!  Then I reached over and ate some of my daughters gumbo fries that blew me away they were so good.  My husband and I even had the opportunity to meet the owners and they had such a beautiful spirit kind and down the earth.  Then for Father’s Day we went back and took my husband this is our new found restaurant!!!  I highly recommend this place if you like Cajun style food.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
My wife and I were on our honeymoon,  staying at the Queen Mary, we decided to head over to shoreline village for the day, so we were strolling through the the shops and browsing at this and that, we then came across Louisiana Charlie's and it looked so good, and we both love jambalaya, we ended up meeting the owner standing on the front patio reviewing the setup for the evening,  presumably of course. He explained how this was very authentic and the jambalaya was his mother's recipe. We said thank you and continue on our venture. However we returned later to be sat at a table off to the side for two that over looked the marina and the beautiful light house. The service was outstanding and very personable. We shared the bbq shrimp and the jambalaya.  We were also asked if we were interested in trying the peach cobbler as a celebratory gift. We declined with full gratitude. To our delight, it was everything we hoped and more. We will most definitely return in reflected visits of our honeymoon.< /Review>

I was a little disappointed. We ordered the jumbo shrimp to share and I thought the flavor would have been throughout the shrimp and potatoes but it seems like they pre-cooked the food and poured the sauce on top instead of cooking the food in the sauce, like I do at home. The sauce was good, but just didn't taste marinated. The service was fast and somewhat friendly, just depends on who you get. The atmosphere was nice. We got seated outside with a great view.</Text>

The food is great.  I got the crab boil and although very expensive, the crab was awesome.  Strawberry lemonade is great too, but awfully pricey.  Skip dessert.  Those jar desserts are made somewhere else and sold at the restaurant, and the "collectible jar" is just a ball jar from the store.  Fun atmosphere and great Cajun food though!<//Text>

My first visit and it will not be the last! If you like Baby Back Ribs, this is a great place! The meat fell right off the bone and tasty too.
The restaurant itself is currently being renovated, the new washrooms are beautiful!<//text>

We had the cajun Nachos. So delicious! Could easily feed 3 people. I give the food 5 stars. The staff was slow. None of them seem to smile. Had to search for a server to pay the tab. Drink prices are through the roof! I'd give service 3 stars. Food prices 3 starts. Drink prices 2 stars. Hope this  helps.</Review>

<Review>The food is Delicious & good size portions! The staff has always been friendly & helpful. It's a rather small restaurant, so I prefer to go for an early dinner & before the crowds. I Strongly suggest the Gumbo Nacho appetizer, which is Fantastic & weather permitting, sit outside, the view is Nice!!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd3125a9e69a1f:0xcfc003a01c5bb266<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Website is junk.  Phone number is broke.  They only serve to-go when they wanna.  They're mostly empty but when they get busy they turn away takeout customers, Average cajun anyways... can't wait to take my money elsewhere.  Good luck Charlie!< /review>

<Text>Came here for the first time to try their big seafood platter which is NOT cheap, and had a situation with the outside seating. Jasmine was great, with awesome customer service but the manager Ally -was horrible!  She’s very  low class and had an attitude!! She has No idea of what customer service is!  She’s on a power trip and had no class in how she conducted herself!! We were planning on coming again with friends but she turned our experience around to make us never want to come here again!!!
Don’t come here unless they change that manager!!! Trust me!</Text>< user_id>

The restaurant was nice however the bathroom needed attention the waiter we had you had to ask for everything the salads were from a bag so pieces were hard and brown.

We spoke with the Manager she was very accommodating and she had there meals remade customer service is key.</text>

1) the Food is the Truth. Period. Let's get that out of the way. And I say that as an Executive Chef. The Food at Louisiana Charlie's is right where its S'Posed to be in the way they layer the flavors
2) the Service is where we hit the Jackpot. Did she turn Cartwheels?.....Tapdance on or Table?......Do a SpokenWord Freestyle at our table??? No....N O....NO!!
What (ANAMARIE) Did was EXACTLY what I expect from from Any Top Shelf server. She Was (Warm)✔ (Knowledgeable)✔ (Genuine)✔ and overall....Competent. Most of us in the Hospitality industry already know this, but as CHEF's, very few of us want to admit....but the reality is:  "GREAT Service can Often Compensate for a Mediocre Meal.....but a GREAT, Perfectly Executed Meal can NEVER Compensate for Mediocre Service".<//text>

Tasty, tummy food. I had the gumbo fries app, which were delicious and enough for four persons to eat as a meal. They dont have a full bar. The available bar drinks were too sweet. Good atmosphere and good food.</Review>

The food was good but not above  average for the cost. I ordered blackened snapper that was barley seasoned. That wasn't the disappointment. The portion you received for your sides was very small. The cocktails were worth the cost. The service was good once we were seated our server a d his help was on it. We were a large party and the servers never should any signs of annoyance with the large lively group. That was refreshing.<//text>

<review>Excellent service. Went on a Sunday afternoon there was a wait but not a long one about 10 mins. You do have seating options downstairs inside or inside patio. I choose to eat upstairs there you can sit outside or inside. Both these options provide a view of the water (very nice) I ordered the catfish and shrimp combo and it was very good. I hear they have pretty bbq too.< /review>< Name>

Wow, that was a lot of money! Beware of "mkt price" and don't forget to ask. I asked for a SINGLE portion of the crab boil and it was $81. I specifically asked for only light seasoning and the meal was very spicy and the offered resolution was add butter. Gross! My husband's ribs were mediocre as was the mushy peach cobbler. Service staff was friendly and attentive but I will not return or recommend.< /text>

< Review>
Great food! My daughter has the shrimp basket and those shrimp were huge. I had the catfish platter with sweet potatoes and corn bread. The sweet potatoes were good but the cornbread was rubbery. We sat on the patio and had views of the harbor. The inside restaurant is very small and narrow. The downside was the wait time.< /Review>

I would give this place no stars if I was able to.Don't plan to go to this place for your birthday. My family member called the restaurant to make reservations for her birthday for a party of 20 +. However was informed they don't do reservations to come into the restaurant the day finally arrived and my family member went to the restaurant and was told they couldn't accomadate such a large party. They could only accommodate a large party of 6..Who does that Louisiana Charlie!!!!! To add salt to injury the restaurant was telling other invitees, that the party was cancelled. Imagine trying to scramble for another restaurant since this information was not  shared the day of the event and not days before when the first phone call was made. Don't waste your time or money!¡!<//review>

<Text>Wow! It just did not do it for me. I had the chicken wings with  collards and green beans. Maybe if I go again it will be shrimp or anything other than the wings. My guest had the bowls and did not enjoy the fried oysters and the fries that comes with the bowl were not crisp. Great service and atmosphere.  Give it a try. Go.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I wasn’t impressed with the food. My husband can smoke food better than them. He is from Louisiana. But when your 6 year old doesn’t  like their food and you ask the waitress to change it for something else, and she says no?? Wow!!! How much effort could that take? It’s just about service, even McDonald’s would change it!! Forget it!!! Good by Louisiana Charlie’s, first time and last one!!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>Me and one of my BFF came on a Friday night. We ordered the Crab boil and Cajun shrimp with garlic noodles. The food was season to perfection.  We had a good Server. This was my friend 1st time and she said she will definitely be back and of course I will.  Just one suggestion use chicken sausages also, so that we may have a choice.Thank you</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This was my first time here and it was fantastic! The gumbo fries was to die for and my friends were adventurous and said the frog legs and gator bites were the good too. I had shrimp etoufee and it was delicious, be careful with the spice levels medium or mild is pretty spicy. The alcoholic beverages were great as well. I definitely will frequenting this restaurant from now on.< /Text>

Baby back ribs were tasty; I had them with the potato salad and greens which were a good balance with the meal.  My husband had the jambalaya. Could have used a tad more fire, but delicious.<//Review>

<time>1553527039043<//time><review>This was a wonderful experience and the wait staff was what made this experience so great I can't  recall her name but she attended to us this past Sunday March 24 around 645-7pm, upstairs,
The restaurant was packed we were seated upstairs the orders were behind but none of that matter because she was so wonderful and patient and peaceful and kept us in the loop of everything that was going on this made the difference customer service is everything politeness is everything and even upon our exit she was just extremely extremely wonderful and memorable might I say again thank you so much who was delicious definitely worth the trip I really wish that I can recall her name but given the information that I provided I think that the restaurant will recall and please thank her.
We have the fried wasters and catfish which was pure perfection my daughter had the ribs with yams and I believe Mac and cheese and she was pleasantly pleased and my husband had the at if a which he said with spicy the delicious me love love love spice him no comment Just bring him water We dare wait about 35 minutes for a table however it was 35 minutes of pure Bliss I say that because of their location we simply took a walk along the boardwalk and watched a ways it was absolutely wonderful peaceful and nice family time I also notice at others on the wait staff were also quite pleasant great family spot for sure< /review>< gmap_id>

So disappointed.   Order the sampler..  3 frog legs, 3 alligator legs and 6 wings.  Both the frog and alligator had been fried just a little to long.   The oil made all of it taste the same.  Not $21 worth of food at all.  Then we had the crab and shrimp boil.  Skinniest crab legs I think I've ever seen.  Not much meat to the legs... just a disappointment.< /review>

<review>I came here on a date and we waited 4/15 minutes to be seated because the hostess forgot to put our names on the list the waitress was horrible she didn't know the specials and was not very attentive however I met the owner Shandra she was very apologetic and I cannot complain about the food it was fantastic... I may go back one more time to see if I can get a better waitress because for me if I'm paying  $150 for dinner I want a nice experience from beginning to end< /review></record>

Buyer Beware!  Food was good and reasonably priced.  When ordering Modelo draft, waitress(Brittney) asked if we would like a "big boy"  no mention of price/size by her or on the menu ends up being a $25 per draft beer.  When I mentioned to the manager that the servers should let guests know what they are getting she did not care about our concerns and blamed us for not asking about the size/price of a beer which is not listed anywhere..  Felt misled, will not go back.</Review>

<Text>Gumbo fries are amazing. Drinks aren’t that great for the price but their big. Been here 2 or 3 times and each time service was horrible. Servers didn’t seem to care much and management never stepped in. Oh and don’t come with a birthday cake because they will charge you just to cut the cake inside the restaurant.</Text><user>101170322039605226670</user></record></dataset><record>

Came here with my girl on sunday around 7pm, got seated immediately which I thought was great then 15min passed without seeing a waiter, place wasnt even that busy, after about 20min of no service we just walked off. Went to a different spot 3x as busy, got seated just as fast and had a waiter taking my girls drink order by the time I came back from washing my hands.<//text>

< Review>
I went tonight with a group of girls. We had a great time. The food is was great. A few of us ordered their flavored lemonade that is way over priced and they don't offer refills. All in all I will visit this restaurant again but will pay close attention to what I order.<//Review>

The food was good, the service not so much.
They seemed put out, and trying to get more napkins and a water for our 18 month old seemed inconvenient!
Coming close to closing time, so hit the door folks!

Delicious Food😋 But was a little disappointed that twice I was asked to change tables yesterday. There were 2 of us so we could only sit on the tables of 2. Restaurant wasn't busy dont understand what was the big deal. Waitress was very nice though. Louisiana Charlie's there are people who prefer to be seated in the Sun🌞.I'm one of them twice I tried but was told to choose another table.<//Review>

Great authentic cajun cuisine.
Jambalaya was delicious.
Buffalo wings spicy not blazing hot... Perfect.
Service was outstanding.
Highly recommended.< /Text>

Place and food is good. The only thing I felt is few items are too large for a single person to have and few are less for 1 person. They need to balance that. Also, recomend to pur some good music for the dinner. Overall good customer service and yes, a great location</review>

Good food, great location.  Staff was slow!
I ordered a pitcher of beer, it took 20 min and no they forgotten the cups; it took an additional 25 minutes for the cups! I just left and told them to retract the already temperd beer.  The weird thing is it was slow, they were not busy..< /text>

Second time here and the food was delicious. But the experience was unfortunately not good. Everything was great till a large group came in and we where literally rushed out by the manager/owner. She needs some etiquette lessons. You treat your customers right not rush them out because a large group comes in charge you and literally pushed out the back door. Never going back.</review>

Don't even waste your time going in there thinking they have good food and service! Overrated! Food is mediocre and service is bad, managers are mean. Just look at the face of the manager (a lady) and see how she's handling stress! I will not go as long as she works there!< /Review>

The promise of the name was not fulfilled here. Overall,  the meal was OK at a waterfront premium cost. The 7 hour smoked ribs lacked smokiness, slathered in mediocre bbq sauce. The corn bread was on par with a Jiffy mix from Albertsons. My jambalaya was good, the the andouille lacked the distinctive Big Easy savory spice. We liked the bbq beans.<//Text>

<Review>Great menu, excellent service and beautiful location. We ordered the gumbo, bbq chicken, yams (get a bowl!), greens and corn muffin. All exceptional. But get the gumbo fries. We'll go back just to try them. The table next to us had them and they couldn't have looked more delicious. Our waiter, Ross, was second to none. Couldn't be happier.< /Review>< pictures>

The workers were very rude. They dont even speak to you when you approach the host desk. The owners are equally rude. Also you can hear them talking bad about there own employees,which is crazy. They are horrible! The food is ridiculously over priced for what you receive. Will never give them my money again. Oh and by the way even though it was not the best experience, I still left a tip😉.</text>

< Review>
Soooo yummy 😋 I got the Cajun penne Alfredo with shrimp and it was to die for. The shrimp was an extra $8 for 5 shrimp but they were big and delicious enough that it was worth it! The seasoning and however they cooked it made it amazing. And somehow the pasta stayed steaming hot for like half an hour outside! When I went to box it up it was still steaming.</Review>

With that said, I usually prefer cleaner flavors. So to each of their own!< /review></record>

<Review>The waiter was more concerned that his shift was ending than taking orders. I ordered Alligator appetizer; the shrimp came, the main course came, but no Alligator. That's what I was willing to try! Oh well, I cannot comment on the food, but the service was horrible!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Horrible service and overpriced. My full review is on Yelp. In short, I ordered their BBQ shrimp appetizer and it came in a bowl of grease with a bit of sauce. Half way into the meal the shrimp shot spicy grease into my eyes when I went to peel it. Waitress / manager / owner? could care less. Said it wasn't their fault and I should just pay the bill and walked away.< /Text>

<Review>The food was so salty it almost burned in your mouth. Mentioned it to the waitress and her response was it is just the cornmeal. Too bad because the seafood itself was cooked very well but almost inedible due to excessive salt.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>Stopped here to dock up with some friends while we were boating and it was the perfect lunch. Food was great, authentic Louisiana style and the view was beautiful, we sat right next to the water. There was a little bit of wait but we were able to walk around all of the cool little shops they have here. One of the cooler piers in Southern California, no doubt.<//review>< pics>

My server was awesome. I think her name was Heidi and she was great. She got everything to me on time and the food was incredible. I will definitely come back to this place. Heidi is one of the best waitresses I've ever had in my entire life!! She is very nice to look at, as well..... 😉< /text>

<username>plu ll Pete< /username><Text>I went to Louisiana Charlie's for Mother's Day lunch.  Our waitress was great but when it came time to express my concerns about the spicy gumbo to the manager (Jason), it was a different story. When Jason came to our table his body language did not suggest that he was coming to rectify the situation and he lacked basic customer service skills.  I told him the gumbo was too spicy and he told me that the servers are instructed to inform the customers that all the food on the menu is spicy (spiciness is very subjective).  Jason said they are unable to do any exchanges due to the high price of seafood, he also explained they are a small establishment, and that they would go out of business if customers were allowed to return/exchange food when they were dissatisfied.  (Side note, the gumbo contained approximately 4 pinky sized snow crab legs and a few shrimp.  Jason responded to me as if the gumbo contained jumbo king crab legs).  He said their policy is "they do not exchange the food" and he wasn't going to take the gumbo off of the bill.  I asked Jason if the policy was posted and he said no. I advised him it should be posted so customers would be able to make a decision about if they want to dine there. Then he said, with a smudge attitude and condescending tone, he would take my suggestion into consideration.  To add insult to injury, when I told Jason he could take the gumbo away he said no and insisted I take it home.  I advised Jason that I didn't want the gumbo and I wasn't going to eat it but he still insisted I take the gumbo home.  Jason then said he was sorry but that was their policy and walked away.  Finally the poor waitress came back, was very apologetic, and told me she had to bring the container otherwise she would have gotten into trouble.
Bottomline is...... customer service isn't a priority, the customer isn't valued, Jason didn't attempt to rectify the situation, and I will not dine at Louisiana Charlie's again.</Text>< user_id>

My husband, two sons and I were visiting from AZ and came here for a late lunch, around 3 p.m. Sat. March 16. We were very impressed with the service and food. Though it was busy, the tables were managed well. We sat outside, ordered the jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, a burger & fries and chicken strips and fries. We all really enjoyed our food and we will make it a point to eat there again next time we are in town!<//text>

I came in and was asked to sit anywhere by the greeter, when I sat down on a table with 4 chairs with a nice view of the pier I was asked to find another seat because it had "too many chairs for one". The place had maybe 5 customers at the time and plenty of other tables available for parties of 4. I asked politely if there was any way I could keep my seat and the waiter told me his manager demanded I take another seat.  I ended up going to the place next door, Parkers Lighthouse, which has a nicer view, extremely friendly customer service, and great food. When I got out the seat I got removed from was still open and had been open. Maybe hire better management and your place won't be a ghost town during a beautiful Friday lunchtime rush.< /Review>

<text>Overpriced cafeteria food in a tourist trap restaurant. The shrimp and sausage in the jambalaya was clearly frozen or canned. Ribs were just OK. Corn was also probably frozen. Zero ambiance, bright harsh lighting in the back dining room and two music tracks playing at the same time competing with one another (one outside and one inside). Servers were nice.< /text><Date>1533162397160<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><gmap_id>0x80dd3125a9e69a1f:0xcfc003a01c5bb266</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Was out of the drink that we ordered and out of the deserts that come in a cup that you get to take home. This was on a Saturday not sure how they were not stocked. Took forever to get out drinks had to remind the waitress. Chicken in my salad was like rubber.</Text>

Very friendly and helpful servers.

The food was terrific! We had the fries with gumbo on top and adult beverages.  Never had my fries served this way and look forward to returning and having them again.< /Text>

<Text>It was 1 1/2 hour wait to be seated and 45 minutes for the food to be brought out; But that wasn’t the problem. Our waiter was very cold, and the price of the food was outrageous.  Today is Sunday June 23 and we dined outside in the front around 6:30ish. According to my receipt our server’s name was Alana. She was a light skin black girl who only smiled a joked around with the white customers ( So ridiculous and funny but true lol) We tried to joke around with her but she kept a nasty and stale look on her face. We wanted more time to order our drinks but she just stood there and rushed us. I ordered 2 plates that cost me $110 (this was just my order and not the price of the entire bill $$$$) The food was good but I’ve ordered the same dish for half the price at boiling crab AND it taste better AND I got more food. Honestly my waiter is what really ruined our dinner....her attitude made the food taste nasty.<//Text>< Pictures>

I had the gumbo (DELICIOUS!)  and they also let us taste the jambalaya. I would definitely recommend either of those. Staff is extremely friendly. Would recommend this to a friend.</Text>< Pics>

They do not offer Togo on the weekend, and that information is not offered on the website nor do they tell you when you call. The staff was also rude when I explained about there being no information stating that and having driven there with the purpose of picking up food. I like the food here, but not enough to be treated badly.</text>

< review>
I can agree with the other reviews about the terrible service. I put my name down and was told it would be about a 45 minute wait. After killing time for 45 minutes, I came back and the hostess couldn’t find our name on this raggedy piece of paper they were using to take down names. I would have had to put my name down again and wait another hour if I hadn’t pointed out where my name was. Then another hostess said they hadn’t even got to my name and that it would be about a 2 hour wait. When I told her she had told me 45 minutes, she claimed she didn’t say that. That was enough to leave. It is absolutely ridiculous that they can’t keep a simple task, like taking names and correct times, in order.</review>

All together I've had the following: Hennesey wings, Jambalaya, Red Beans and Rice, Crab Legs and Shrimp fajitas, fried fish and shrimp, corn bread, sweet tea...so needless to say I come with certification. Lol. When I tell you, they have the BEST Red Beans and Rice I've ever had ( sorry mom. Lol)...its true. However everything (except the Jambalaya) I've had was DELICIOUS and seasoned well (not too.salty). The Jambalaya was overcooked and the extremely shredded chicken changed the texture...I didnt care for it. However, you will not find better fried fish in the area...extremely impressed. Customer service was great also, it was extremely busy on our night but the manager/or owner was still polite and patient and still working like everyone else. As far as the price , I'll post my receipt and you can be the judge.... Bottom line, I will be back!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1563124849863<//Time><rate>5< /rate></record>

<text>The food was cold which doesn't work with French fries.  The food is over priced and my wife is Creole and this food is not authentic tasting.  When I chose to leave the restaurant do to bad service and food the manager was more concerned about me paying for 2 hot teas I ordered instead of finding out how they felled to get my money.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dd3125a9e69a1f:0xcfc003a01c5bb266</Gmap_id>< username>

We signed in and was told 45 minutes and they would call us.  It took about an hour and we got an outside water view seat.  It got a little windy and cold, they dropped the tarp and had heaters.  Then, nobody knew who was going to serve us.  A really nice girl took our order, gave us our drinks, and an hour an twenty minutes later we got up and left because we never saw our food or server.  Even people that came in after us were asking how long we waited.  Final straw was when two other tables that came in after us got their appetizers before we got anything, which was after they sat for an hour.  The menu asks for patience, which we had, but that was crazy.  We didn't even get a refill of drinks in the hour and twenty minutes.  It's a shame because the food looked awesome.</Text>

<Review>We have had positive dining experiences before, but no more - their star waitress is no longer there, and it's obvious that none of those running or working in the restaurant have any customer service experience.  Granted it was Father's Day and very busy, but we had health situations that required us to have a little morsel - a cracker or something from the kitchen.  They were absolutely UNACCOMMODATING - refusing to help us at all with any crackers or anything from the kitchen to tide us over for the long wait for our table.  We ended up getting excellent service and food from next door.  There were no apologies,  and no hint of any caring for customers.  Extremely disappointed!!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

My problem was the customer service I was seated for 20 minutes no service, I overheard the waitress say I was playing musical chairs because I moved out the sun. I think some people are really rude. The food is great but it's starting not to be worth the hassle and yes you pay for parking.< /text><GmapID>0x80dd3125a9e69a1f:0xcfc003a01c5bb266</GmapID>< Date>

Employee host Marie was very sweet and great smile and shes made us feel very welcome. We set on the patio near the water🤩 very relaxing plus we had a long day.... always sit by water while u enjoy ur food. Employees Rob, Ryan where great... alot of the employees helped me thru my nervousness. Manager Jason was great he helped me thru it too. He also went around everybody tables too check up on things. He moves very fast and get things done. Our server name Anamalia has a very beautiful name and yes we told her. She kept checking up on us and we didnt wait long for our drinks and food. She has a great smile and make u feel welcome too and We ordered Blackened Shrimp with greens and mac and cheese 😁 our food was nice and hot. Our food was fresh not something you just warmed up and if you kno about food then u kno the difference. This is our spot. We will be back soon. Thank you employees and managers for everything. Y'all are the best. We will be back soon. This is our favorite place too come. Much love from me and my fiance<//Text>< Pictures>

Shrimp and sausage gumbo over fries, sinful but delicious. They had run out of several drafts by 5:30 which was disappointing. Huge portions, enough to share.< /review>

< Review>
I have never wrote a review as bad as this one, but here it goes. The waitress was helpful and you “get a feeling” she is trying to make up for the issues going on (complaints on food and prices) in there. She was very nice, but the helpers  had really bad attitudes which gave a feeling of hostility. We got the “Cajon Crab legs and shrimp” which was 60 dollars . There were 3 of us sharing which we didn’t feel was worth 60 dollars . Fresh Lemonade drinks were 9 dollars a piece with “NO ALCOHOL”. Let me get to the food, not worth the money we paid . I couldn’t leave the full tip usually 20% on my part. The waitress made it bearable. If your reading the reviews they are mixed , I would rather have gone to MCDONALDS . Please heed the bad reviews........</Review>

Today's my sister n law birthday so I decided to take her and Mom to dinner.  It at least 45 minutes to be seated.  Another hour to place an order.  Well after another hour my sister n law's Alligator bites finally arrived and she said they taste like rubber. I ordered red beans and rice; mac n cheese;greens & red snapper. Needless to say i sent the red beans and rice back; mac n cheese; greens & snapper was just nasty.  The only thing my mom enjoyed was her shrimp and everything else was not good . My check was 139.42. I asked to speak to the manager and after waiting another 40 minutes i was told the manager had left and was told nothing could be done about check or the service. I will not be going back to the establishment and I warned other patrons not eat there.  The female Manager was rude and very unprofessional. Never again< /review>

<text>Place for Cajun food.  Kind of pricey place for food, but the servings are pretty big.  I had the creole jambalaya which was a huge plate, I just wish there was an option for rice instead of crackers.  For some reason there was a lot of resistance to make single receipts for the 3 of us.< /text>< UserId.>

<Text>Piss poor customer service/rules...arrived late to friend's lunch and I could not order any food. Told me I would need to put my name on a waitlist with hostess even though I was seated with friends. Then I attempted to order food to go and was told "no food to go" on the weekends.  I will make sure friends and family do not patronize this restaurant.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The food is good, the staff is friendly, there are some strange rules (for a place like that) but in the end they are posted at the entrance and you can only blame yourself if you get upset by the rules you ignored.<//Review>

<Text>Well,when you are savoring this exquisite food,ribs etc,there's no time for a review,but after, ,humm you have to choose the right words to reviw it,starting with the owner who so humble stand there and greet you with a big smile,then down to the rest of the gang,you really enjoy food and the place,like I  said you can run out of words to describe it,the best i can said is go try it,and you will understand why I go there all the way from Rialto Ca,I m donne< /Text><rate>5</rate>< gmap_id>

<review>Cajun Chicken salad is AMAZING!!! Add a side order of garlic bread to the salad; verg buttery and delicious.  Spinach artichoke dip, crab boil, macaroni & cheese, and chicken etouffe are fantastic!  Really feels like you're in New Orleans, but still in Long Beach.  The servers, hostess, and other restaurant staff are so warm and friendly, I felt like I was being served at home by my older cousins.  LoL!  Great place to go for a fun first date, with family, or by yourself while looking out at the Long Beach Shoreline.👌👌👌<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dd3125a9e69a1f:0xcfc003a01c5bb266<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Super delicious and authentic cajun food. I ordered the crawfish etoufe, it was spicey and hearty, I would have served with a mini baguette however. My husband ordered the fried catfish and it was probably the best I have ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant, this is where I will eat when I come back to town.<//text>

<Review>This place had altright food but they thieves check your final statement from bank a 25.77 bill showed up as a 41.77 bill thats no simple typo.  and when i went down there "oh you have you email corporate bye" no phone numbers to corporate and website is only for this location no link to any corporate site. So will be contacting bank as fraud as well.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Terrible Service and mediocre food. Me and my wife put our name and number in with the hostess. We wait off to the side about 50ft from the entrance. 20 minutes later, they call to tell me our table is ready. As we walk over, we see a couple who just walked up get seated. The hostess gave our seats to them thinking it was us. Then she seats us at some tiny booth right in front of the kitchen instead, where waitresses loudly argue with each other over messed up orders. We politely ask to be moved and are met with an annoyed look from the hostess. Skip to the food which LOOKED good and tasted like rubber. Meat was overcooked, under seasoned and tough. We ordered desert and after an hour, it still wasnt ready. As we were waiting for it, the same hostess comes over trying to make us move tables to seat a party of 6, even though there was a huge empty table right next to us. Everyone in the area just looks at the empty table and then at her shaking our heads. We finally get our desert, finish it and leave as the large group gets seated at the large empty table like they should have been. Our check was over $100 for poor service, and lousy food. It was my first time leaving a restaurant without tipping. Never coming back.< /text><Name>dkwoods3d<//Name>< pictures>

Visited yesterday during offpeak time, before even the blue hairs were out and about. Service was a little slow, and they were out of a few items, but everything else we sampled was pretty solid. Frog legs are awesome!< /review>

Horrible service ,waited over 1hr to get a table and when we finally did get our table we didn't even get a server, they run out of stuff and dont tell you until after the food gets there , we waited and waited for our server to come but never did , the girl who took the drink order never put in the order so another girl took our order it was just a big sloppy mess , they kept saying,  "we are really busy , she didn't put the order in ,the bar is backed up , we are really busy" They should really take the time to prepare since they are so popular and the food is good, but this time was a horrible experience for me , I have been here 2x before and never got treated like that , that's why it's so shocking ,overall the guy or the buser (not sure) was the nicest ,but I wont be coming back here for a while & if I do it wont be on a Sunday<//Text>

The customer service is absolutely horrendous!   They obviously don't believe in making the customer happy. All they seem to know Is that the food tastes good but they can careless about the customer! Came in with my family and ordered the tri- tip sandwich which was great but the fries were spicy. We were told by the manager that if we wanted fries without the spice that we would have to pay for another side of fries! Thank God our server Kayla was awesome,  because without her we wouldn't have even considered returning!</Text>

Louisiana Charlie's is delicious! But, they lose a star because they got rid of their mouth watering chili cheese fries. They were so good and I can't believe they kicked it to the curb! Hopefully in the future, they'll bring it back. Otherwise, their burgers are always yummy and the spicy alfredo is on point! My kids loved their chicken strips but they did not care for the "pizza" kids meal at all. Maybe if they baked it more, it would turn out nicer.  It's just a hotdog bun split in half with cheese and pepperoni. I dont like that they charged us $10 for that, definitely not worth it. Their strawberry lemonade is great! Just a bit expensive.<//Text>

<text>Food is the pits here. Service is marginal. BBQ IS very chewy and certainly not fresh. I had to run to the Oval Office just after finishing my food.

<Review>Bbq ribs is ok not much of a fan. Side dishes are awful. When u check in make sure ask the host "how long the wait for party of 6" if not, on yelp it says based on ALL PARTY SIZES which isn't true. We waited for almost 3 hrs before they explained that they have limited seats.<//Review>< Rate>

<Name>D C< /Name><Time>1424133797034< /Time><Rate>1</Rate><Review>I rode up to Long Beach from Escondido on a whim, not having a date for Valentine's Day. I expected long lines everywhere and wasn't disappointed.
Louisiana Charlie's, however, had empty tables and no line I could see. Being from East Texas I thought some etoufee would be a nice change.
Walked in the front door; no sign about "wait to be seated" and I was ignored. Snagged a two-seat table and waited for someone to notice me. Just on the edge of being irked and a young lady walked back with a couple following; she shot daggers at me and said something to the couple; it was clear she intended to seat them there.
She put them elsewhere and came to me. "It's not free seating. You're supposed to wait to be seated."
"Well, I walked in and was ignored so I seated myself."
In response she asked my name and said, "I've put you on the list. You can wait your turn outside."
I glanced around at the empty tables (four just in my area) and just walked out passing the non-existing line at the door.
Thus I can't review their food and will never darken their doors again.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The service was BAD to begin with. We walked inn and the hostess ignored us because she was to busy helping employees. Other people before us were already complaining about the wait. We notice a lot of empty tables from our view. We waited patiently for 1 hr for a table of 7. The food price is to high for such little servings. Half our table was dirty and the floor around us was messy. Our waiter was not friendly either. She hardly ask if we needed something. I've never been so dissapointed in my life at a resteruant service. Not coming back again!.< /Text>

We choose outside, he said you can sit right there. As we went to sit down a lady said oh we are just going to seat ourselves huh go ahead and get up and wait in the front.

<rate>5< /rate><Review>This place is the "real deal"!I had to come here and see for myself after reading all of the bad reviews of this place.Let me tell you people,the food here is some of the best I've tasted this side of Louisiana. The etouffee was absolutely delicious,as was the crab boil and the alligator legs,yummy!Iwould have to disagree with those who gave this place one star.This place deserves at least 4 stars.Most of the complaints were about slow or poor service,but that is going to happen from time to time,especially when a resturant is extremely busy.If you are going to leave an host review, at least wait until you have actually tasted the food to do so.
It makes no sense to diss a food establishment just because you had a long wait ,yet have no idea how the food tastes.To all of you who have left this place after possibly being served or waited on by an inexperienced employee,please,don't discount this place.The food is actually much better than the 3.6 average they have received and is well worthy of another try.Don't miss out on an excellent, well flavored meal!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dd3125a9e69a1f:0xcfc003a01c5bb266</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I went here with my family during a group meetup we had scheduled in long beach.  I ordered the rice and beans with Andalusian sausage.

I personally found myself wishing there was more of a selection to choose from. Most of our party had a similar issue.  The food itself was filling,  but i really wish there had been more than 2 pieces of sausage in my dish.

The water also didnt taste very clean.  Either the ice or the source was off.  I dont think i would make it a point to visit again.</Review><UserId.>113850021953095280226< /UserId.>< Pics>

<username>Shelly Foreman< /username>< review>
Seriously, if I could rate this 0 stars I would. Being from Louisiana(Baton Rouge area), the food here is cringe worthy. Me and my family all got the 'signature' Louisiana dishes. Crawfish etoufee? Disgusting. More like gravy. Jambalaya? WATERY! The 'andouille' tastes like hotdogs. And red beans and rice? I can't even give you a comparison to how awful it was. This place makes Louisiana look bad. I honestly would love to show people what REAL Louisiana Cajun style food tastes like because this place is far from it. Then again it IS in California. What really surprised me was that the owners themselves are FROM Louisiana. Very disappointing.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Very good food, the crocodile !!! The best I have ever eaten. Today he had ribs and shrimp, excellent flavor and service. Recommended, you can eat with your pets, of course only at tables outside the restaurant, what I liked is that they provide water to our little furry and birds. Anyway, a good place to go to eat with the family without exception of anyone.

(Original)
Muy buena comida, el cocodrilo!!! Lo mejor que he comido. Hoy tocó costillitas y camarones, excelente sabor y servicio. Recomendado, puedes comer junto a tus mascotas, claro solo en mesas fuera del restaurante, lo que me agradó es que les proporcionan agua a nuestros pequeños peludos y aves. En fin, buen lugar para ir a comer con la familia sin excepción de nadie.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good.
Spicy Cajun cuisine for those who like it.
We have taken a Bowl with prawn lobster that is the dishes for which they are famous.
The dish costs $ 60 but is eaten in two.
Book before otherwise wait long species on weekends.
