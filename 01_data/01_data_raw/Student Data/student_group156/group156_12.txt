<text>Had a wonderful experience.Vicky was awesome and made the whole process fun. Orlando was very nice as well. This was my first time actually buying a car myself so I was nervous at first but it was such a smooth process. I was very particular about what I wanted and they did a great job helping me get what I was looking for. I am so happy with my new car!< /text><time>1623303611094< /time><gmap_id>0x80e9ad52be9501e7:0x613472f8f45d20f5< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

<Text>Working with Vicky was literally the most painless experience I've ever had with anything. Especially being a first time car buyer I was terrified to make such a big purchase. Vicky made me feel comfortable and safe knowing what all the numbers ment which was the most important to me. I will definitely be referring friends her way.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is my second purchase from this Enterprise Sales location!
I appreciate the no pressure, no haggling, no stress experience.
I enjoy purchasing vehicles here, they Only offer the Best of the Best of the Rental fleet.
By far this is an easy way to purchase a new vehicle.</Review>< gmap_id>

<text>I had a great salesperson in Vicky.   She was delightful and walked me through the process.   I was unhappy with the keyless option on the toyota camry, brought it back after driving it for a weekend and She helped me replace it with an altima.   When I buy another car I will go back and have Vicky help me.    great work Enterprise!!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1625066143889, 'text': "David Morris, thank you for your positive review.

Orlando and team were fantastic! We had seen a car online, called in and were able to send a majority of the information needed prior to going on property. Everything was very well organized for keeping everyone safe during covid, but also keeping the process fast. We got onto the property at 1:01 and I was sitting in my new car leaving at 1:34. I can't promise that they can do it that fast for everyone, but it is the best car buying experience we have ever had and plan to go back in the future. Thank you Enterprise Car Sales and Orlando.</Review>

The process of purchasing a car can be long and frustrating when you don't have 5 star credit.   Malana Sobel at Enterprise Car Sales, located in Ventura, California made the process easier then we could have anticipated.

She worked hard and did all the leg work before we walked onto the lot.  She treated us with respect knowing that we are in the process of credit repair. She processed the paperwork quickly and off we went with our new vehicle.

I would encourage anyone working to repair your credit and in the market for a new vehicle to contact Malana at Enterprise Ventura.   You won't be sorry.

Thank you from the Davis Family< /Text>

We had a great experience buying a truck at Enterprise Car Sales.  The customer service was pleasant, friendly, helpful, and never pushy at all.  The staff went out of their way to make the experience easy and make sure we were getting exactly the vehicle we wanted.  I highly recommend this company and will probably buy more vehicles from them in the future.  Our salesman, Orlando, was fantastic and went above and beyond in service and the manager, Mel, was super supportive and helpful.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I found a Honda Civic at a location out of state. The shipping charge was less than what I had paid for shipping a car recently. The total was a good price for the 2019 model. I expected a delay in delivery. There was no tracking service provided so I was surprised when the car arrived early. It was reassuring that I was not required to purchase the car although I did pay for the shipping in advance. That seems more than fair. The Covid precautions at the office were good to see. The contract process for a cash purchase (credit card plus personal check) was the usual lengthy dealership paperwork. Online documents would have been preferred. Overall good experience. No issues with the car.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>As a previous New Car Dealer for over 25 years, it was interesting to start the car buying process from the customer perspective. I can honestly tell you that Enterprise Car Sales does a tremendous job. They have excellent people and very very good no haggle pricing. From Mel the manager, to Milana our salesperson, our experience was excellent in every way. We wanted a fairly hot commodity, preowned Jeep Wrangler, and they kept on it until they were able to get us one in the color we were looking for. There was a small defect in the seat trim which they promptly resolved. We couldn’t be happier, and we won’t hesitate to recommend them to all our friends and relatives. Our Jeep Wrangler only had 10k miles on it and looked like brand new. Go there, you won’t be disappointed.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1597346449064, 'text': "Thank you for your review, Kevin.

Best place to buy a car. Friendly and helpful staff. No pressure to buy. Allows you to test drive anything for as long as you feel you need. Did not restrict where you could go. Answered all my questions. if they did no have the car you were looking for, they would help you by seeing if another dealership if theirs did and have it brought in. They have newer cars at great prices in great condition with low mileage. Highly recommend this dealership.< /Text>

<Text>I was referred to Enterprise Car Sales by AAA after my car was totalled. I was not looking forward to the next car buying experience. Troy was very understanding of my situation and not pushy. I told him what I was looking for over the phone and he texted good clear pictures of what they had. When I came out to see the car, it completely met my expectations. They had it pulled up in front and ready for me. I took it for a quick spin and knew I wanted the car. The office was clean and Covid standards with distancing and plexiglass. The entire staff was very nice and helpful. This was the easiest car purchase I have ever made.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1603977255098, 'text': 'Thank you for the awesome review, Janis Harrison!

I had a particular set of circumstances that I explained to Mel Pena in the Ventura, CA office.  She totally got what was wanted and needed and did everything to fulfill on that - and very quickly at that.  She is smart, compassionate, professional and great to work with.  I will be referring everyone I know to Mel when their need for a car arises.

As for the car itself?  It's fantastic.  Everything works as it's supposed to.  There's not even a nick anywhere on the car and my mechanic congratulated me on my purchase.  The next time I need a car, Mel will be hearing from me.< /review>

The overall experience wasn't bad.  The product was as expected.  The length of time to purchase was extremely to long.  And Much to my surprise the car was sold without a cleaning, there were no floor mats (perhaps in all the cars I did test drive I missed but surprising)
The sales manager told me that it was taking so long because the salesman was fueling and washing the vehicle. Funny as when I arrived home and was looking over the vehicle I had 16 miles to empty.  So basically either she lied to me or the sales man didn't do his job.  I have come to expect great service from Enterprise apparently the standards are not as high at Enterprise car sales.< /Review>

< Review>
Found a vehicle online that was in the Bay Area and paid almost $600 to have it transferred, was told it would arrive within 3 to 4 days. On the 4th day after having multiple communications with manager (Mel) I was notified that the car had not even shipped, They refused to refund the transfer fee even though the car had not been transferred at that point. Attempted to speak with Mel about getting a refund and she dodged all of my calls. Still isn’t calling back after talking to other employees at dealership. I’ll be eating that $600 fee, which is fine by me cause I don’t want to deal with these people again. They can consider it my pity money.

Clearly this place doesn’t want to sell cars moving at the pace that they do. Any other dealership would have a car transferred between Ventura and SF within 3 days at the max. (Also, an experience with Enterprise Car Sales in Ventura that I had with car sales 2 years - had a car transferred, upon arrival backup camera was not working after supposedly they had done this multipoint inspection. Told me it would take 7-10 days to get it fixed. What a joke.)

In theory, the car buying process with them should be easy. In practice its been nothing but a headache. Ended up buying from an actual car dealer in the area who had what I wanted and negotiated with me to the price that I wanted.

I’ll give it two stars because Orlando is a rockstar and fought to get the car transferred. Unfortunately, area manager Mel couldn’t back up her employees to make it happen within the time frame that I was originally given.</Review>

They did get a car I was looking for, and let me know right away, which was great.  They also have decent customer service, and are very nice.  I did have a couple of surprises I wasn't expecting.  My windshield has a couple of chips.  They had been filled in, so the window won't crack, but I wish I'd have seen them before purchase. I would have asked for that to be discounted.  I was told that I have Sirius free for 90 days, but I was not told I'd have to sign up for it.  If it's free, they should sign up for it, and have it active when the vehicle is purchased.  Great place if you're looking to purchase cheaper than the dealer, but with better quality than CarMax.</Text><name>V Ll</name>< Pics>

Leran is dynamite!👍

I told him what kind of vehicle I wanted.

Within 6 days he confirmed with me that he’d found it.

Leran personally drove to So. California and brought back the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe I was looking for  - in metallic white! Fabulous!

Contact Leran in Ventura, Ca. Let him know what you’re looking for. You will get what you want!

And, he stays in touch! His communication is superb!<//Text>

<rate>4</rate><Review>Salesperson who sold me car and salesperson who delivered car from Ventura to Santa Barbara were lovely and answered all questions.  I wish I'd looked further into what the add'l $1,500-ish extension of warranty covered, as I might not have purchased that, but I was in a rush so that's on me.  But the car passed muster w/my mechanic, it's been fine so far, and worth the purchase price (perhaps minus the extended warranty, though only time will tell).  My only complaint is that the car looked like it had been washed and waxed, but wiped off w/dirty cloths, so it looked spotted and kind of dirty when it was delivered and I had to immediately get it washed, but that's a tiny complaint.
I found salesperson to be honest and forthcoming and am grateful I received the courteous assistance that I did.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Easiest car purchase ever. We talked to Orlando by phone to let him know what kind of car we were looking for. He found two that fit within our parameters that were not yet on the market. After some discussion we decided on the one we thought we'd like the best and he arranged to have it brought in a few days later. He was clear that there was absolutely no obligation if we didn't like it. Well, of course, we did. The car is in like new condition and we got a good deal on it. The process was smooth, professional, and friendly. I know where we will buy our next car when the time comes!< /Text>

So happy with my experience with Enterprise! They have great customer service and made it so easy to search for and buy my new truck. They were very knowledgeable and motivated to find the exact truck I was looking for. Very satisfied, and would definitely buy a car from Enterprise again!<//Text>

If you are sick of high pressure sales and sitting in a car dealership for hours while they play games with different offers - Enterprise is the answer to a fast, efficient, fair dealership, in Ventura. We have purchased two vehicles from them in the last 3 years and recommend  them highly. We have worked with Jamie and Aaron in sales - they are wonderful. The new finance manager, John is as professional and friendly as the last one ( can't remember his name) We have had no problems with either of the vehicles and love both of them.</text>

Veronica and :Mel were outstanding.  They were professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  The process of buying a car in a rush due to my husband’s 20 year old car death was actually fun and enjoyable.  It wasn’t a long process as it normally is when buying from a dealer.  It was the most fun we had buying a car.  The car was clean and in great shape.</Text>

I was looking for a vehicle for months and finally decided to purchase from Enterprise. I was able to apply for financing from home which saved a lot of time. After that I was contacted by staff to discuss the vehicle I was interested in. The staff was welcoming, polite, courteous and attentive. The staff was definitely not pushy and understanding of my needs. I was able to get a great deal and I’m very happy with my purchase. Mel and Devin were a pleasure to work with. Highly recommend.</text>

We had great service from Aaron and Jonathan. We knew about what we wanted and Aaron showed everything he had there on the lot. Then went online to review what else was available. Both were very efficient and did not waste our time. We would like to thank them both.<//Review>

I recently purchased a vehicle from Enterprise car sales in Ventura and the professional staff were very friendly and made me feel like part of the family. They did everything possible to provide me with the vehicle I was looking for. It was quick. Hassle free. They took car of everything.Right there on the spot. I cant think of anyway the transaction could have been improved. It was perfectly painless and enterprize performed above and beyond my expectations. So 5 stars.</review>

<text>What an extremely seamless experience. Both Korissa and Imelda shopped lending institutions for the best deal and streamlined me through the endless stacks of paper which are the hallmark of automobile purchases in California. However, it was the clever and courteous Arthur who patiently would not let my never ending obstacles to the sale prevent me from going home without the car of my dreams. I have never experienced such a profoundly pleasant car purchasing experience. When our family needs its next vehicle, I will surely return to Enterprise Car Sales in Ventura.< /text>< pictures>

I knew the type of car I wanted, found some options on their website and contacted the branch for assistance. Jamie was extremely professional and helpful and sent me details of the cars available. I picked the one I wanted, and it was delivered the following day. After a test drive, we hammered out the paperwork in about an hour and I was on my way. I have always and will always recommend this branch to anyone wanting a great, late-model car!< /Review>

We were helped by Mel, Jose, Korissa, and Jonathan.

They were all top notch, helpful, and nothing short of fantastic. I came in knowing what to expect, ex fleet cars that are up to date years and decent models with awesome pricing!

Will refer all my family here and friends, great job everyone!

Thanks< /Review>

<user_name>Dolores Flores</user_name><Time>1507666546340</Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>David deserves 5 stars. I live in Central Calif, and David, one of the finance managers, drove the car to me from So Calif. I did most of the dealings by phone (I got my own loan from a credit union) and signed the final paperwork with David. He was very pleasant, friendly and courteous, and explained everything and answered all of my questions thoroughly. He also kept me informed, by calling several times throughout the day, about when he would be arriving. However, when I was arranging the transport of the car, on the previous day, I was speaking to Ray, who was the finance manager of the Ventura site. He was curt and abrupt with me, during several phone conversations, and indicated by his attitude that he was irritated about bringing the car to me. He stated that he was going to be paying a $300 transport fee, himself, in order to bring me the car. It was my understanding that the fee was for towing the car so that I could test drive. But since I was not test driving, but purchasing, there was no need for a transport fee (they were driving to deliver the car to me). I was extremely glad that David came instead of Ray. I seriously considered canceling my purchase, after the final conversation with Ray, just because of Ray's attitude. It's too bad that one person can affect the reputation of an entire organization. I've heard a lot of positive things about purchasing from Enterprise but when a top manager represents the company in this way, it makes one pause.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>This as the second time I bought a car from this enterprise. I had a great experience the first time which is why I came back. Unfortunately this experience was not nearly as good. I was planning on trading in 2 vehicles and purchasing a truck. When I went in with the first vehicle everyone was great and they offered me $1,750 for that car which included a AAA discount. I went back the next day with my second vehicle and to close the deal. After they examined my car the found it was worth nothing ( it was. 1993 truck with 333,000 miles. No surprise) but somehow my total trade in value you came out to $500 less than originally agreed upon for my first car. The finance lady, her name was Coleen, had given me the quote on my first car. And when we started to argue about it she told me I was lying and that she never agreed to that dollar amount. I told her to call the salesman that helped out with the quote and she refused. The manager wouldn’t budge on the value and didn’t give me what they had promised. Unfortunately I was in a desperate situation and needed the truck so I had to purchase it that day. My mom called the manager the next day because she was with me when they gave us the original price of $1,70 for the first car. And again l, they said we were wrong and misunderstood and refused to take responsibility. They even said they called the salesman helping us when me and my wife were there which was a bold face lie. They didn’t seem to care at all about our satisfaction. I will not be returning to this location for my next car. They do not know how to run a business and something needs to be done about the employees who lied, cheated, and deceived us.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I traded in my vehicle into Enterprise for the best price available (Enterprise gave me $800 more for my vehicle than Car Max offered) and I drove out with a beautiful 2014 Ford Mustang about an hour later.  Jamie Cannon did a wonderful job helping me out.  I'll definitely consider Enterprise Car sales the next time I purchase a vehicle.</Text>

<text>I was completely satisfied with the service from both the car sales representative to the financial manager.  I really felt Enterpise worked with me in getting the  car I wanted for my needs and  in the payment range I was looking for.   It felt good not to be pressured or haggled,  as I have experienced with car dealers.   The process to purchase a car is a lot shorter than at a dealership.   A car dealer at a car lot when, showing interest  can often keep you in their office for hours, and the sometimes the result of you leaving without making a purchase.   At Enterprise,  we simply walked away after 20 minutes in our initial visit because the car we wanted wasn’t on the lot.  However they delivered a car the next day and i test drove it and liked it very much, and made the purchase.  I have to say it was a much better experience than any car dealership I have been to.  This is the reason I give them a high rating.</text>< resp>

We had jumped around quite a bit looking for a SUV after my parent's vehicle was totaled in an accident. After about 3 or 4 dealerships been ended up here and by this point I had already made a loan agreement with a local credit union.

The dealership actually managed to get me a better deal by searching through other local credit unions and with a better quality car than we had been looking at before. Above and beyond service from Mel, who helped us and everyone else there.<//text>

I had been searching for my car for  a while, and was patient to wait for the perfect timing when Veronica called me to say the car I requested was in Ventura and ready for me to test drive. I drove it and purchased it! Thats all it took, great car great price and a great staff!<//review>

We searched everywhere for a car and dealt with all kinds of sales people, most just wanted that paycheck and to get us out of their hair.
Not enterprise.
They really went above and beyond to help us find a car that truly fit our needs. We worked with Veronica Krohl and Daniel Ruiz and they were fantastic. They even put up with our 1 year old throwing a fit. I can't recommend them enough. If you're on the fence about going through them, do it. You won't regret it.<//Text>

< Review>
This was our first experience with buying a car, and this place ruined car shopping for us. The employee and manager were very pushy, condescending, and rude. They seemed rushed when trying to get us to pick out a vehicle, and made snide comments when we told them we would like to shop around. The next day, we got a follow up call from them, and when we told them that we had decided to pursue another dealership, they made a very rude comment about the reliability of vehicles that were not theirs. Will definitely not be going back there ever again, to rent or to buy.<//Review>

<review>was shopping for a newer car for my daughter.  We started at Enterprise and went no further.  It was by far and away the best car buying experience that I have ever had - and I have bought a lot of cars.  Meghan, the sales representative, was a dream to work with.  No pressure, no upselling to something we didn't need, and listened to what we wanted.  The sales manager Alejandro was also great - getting the paperwork processed, realistically assessing our trade-in, and generally giving us the feeling that we were important to Enterprise.  I would definitely recommend going to Enterprise for a great deal and a great car buying experience.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I found my experience to be very easy and stress free. The personnel were professional and friendly, very nice accommodations/offices and had a nice selection of vehicles to choose from. They actually had another vehicle delivered that I wanted to compare with other ones at the location. I would highly recommend this location if you were in the market for a pre-owned vehicle.</review>

< Review>
I was driving a rent a car from enterprise and I liked the car and told that to the customer service Rep Spencer at the Thousand Oaks depot,Spencer told me about there used car lot and how only the best cars that have not been in accidents with full service records get sold there,the rest go to Carmax and other used and abused car lots.Well a sales woman named Veronica Krol from the Ventura used division contacted me and told me more and asked what I was looking for,when I went to the lot she had a variety of cars to choose from and one of them was perfect for me,we test drove it and they took my other car for a trade in at a value I could never have gotten somewhere else,Arthur the finance a prince of a guy wrapped it up and after a total of 2 hours from arrival I was driving off in a mint 2016 Nissan Rouge fully loaded at a tremendous deal.This is the place to buy trust me and it came with warranties at a price that can't be matched anywhere.I also learned that Enterprise is the largest transportation company in the world! Some good trivia for you and exactly why they can be a cut above the rest.</Review>

High marks to the sales staff for the low pressure dealing and willingness to get us the car we wanted. Aaron jumped in a car and drove down to Gardenia and back from Ventura the afternoon we stopped in to get us the exact car we were after. Tony got us financing for under 3% and we had all docs signed and keys in our hand inside of an hour!

Lower marks to the quality of the car we purchased. After getting it home and giving it a good wash, I noted a poorly repaired rear bumper, a faulty headlight and several door dings. To their credit, Enterprise immediately took it back. They drove it to their maintenance facility in Sylmar. We got it back a week later (unwashed and with 1/8 tank of gas) with a professional repair/repainted bumper, but had to drop it off a few days later so that they could again drive it to Sylmar to replace the headlamp. After 3 weeks of ownership, Enterprise employees have put more mileage on my car than I have.  For paying top bluebook price for the car, I expected a near perfect car when driving it off the lot, not 3 weeks and 200mi later.

Would I buy from Enterprise again, yes. But I will be less forgiving next time.<//text>

I literally saw a phone case that would fit my phone after asking and being told they didn’t have any that would fit, I didn’t say anything I just left the store giggling and got a case for, Target instead. It’s an OK location though, people seem nice.</Review>

Monday I was going to another appointment and the map was going downward instead of up so I could read it.  40 minutes late, I had to call for directions!!  I have only used it twice because this was first time at both locations.  I will practice on this phone but I was much happier with my old note 4.  I have a note 9!< /text>< pictures>

< review>
The staff here is really nice and friendly, they are so helpful with any concerns or questions that arise, the assistant manager ed  is very knowledgeable of what he sells and how the devices work, I can tell the staff depend on him with many issues that arise when I was there for a bill payment many of the staff would call him or ask him for help for questions or device issues, and he was right there ready to answer any questions or concerns, and when he helped me he was very helpful and friendly with any questions or concern I had he had the answer to it right away with no hesitation, but I'm sure he's gotten the same question before!

Will come back for their expert service and friendly service!<//review>

Horrible serviice! Went to store to upgrade my phones. Was only notified of half of the fees they were charging me until i began asking questions. By the time I was advised of the "hidden fees" Aaron had already taken the screen protector from my current phone. I cancelled the purchased and left the store without having my screensaver replaced. Horrible experience!< /text>

<text>I went into a T-mobile retail store #2807 at 1313 w. 17th St Santa Ana, CA. I was helped by Bianca! She said let me see if you qualify for our services! I gave her my social security number! I didn't want to make the switch from Verizon to T-mobile! So I left the store! Bianca opened up 3 cell phone lines under my social security number and then cancelled them! I've received a bill for $133 and now a 2nd bill for $14! I didn't get much help from calling customer service! T-mobile hasn't done anything to help me! If this is how T-mobile trains their employees, I want nothing to do with T-mobile! Don't ever give your social security number to T-mobile! I thought T-mobile would do something to help me, but they don't care! Does that employee get more of a bonus for opening 3 cell phone lines? This is a bad way to try and get customers T-mobile! If Bianca didn't set up this fraudulent account, I probably would have switched to T-mobile!< /text>< rate>

Worst customer service ever! Tall
, skinny Mexican guy with a clean cut did everything he could to make sure I was dissatisfied with the experience. The phone is good though. I'll just make sure to buy it off Craigslist next time to avoid that activation fee.</Text>

I came in to the store to get a phone replacement because my phone is no longer charging anyways the guy who helped me out is an ASS! He supposedly placed the order in for a replacement which I should have received this past Monday or Tuesday.  Wednesday came along and my phone wasn't here yet. So I decided to call tmobile at 611, the person who I spoke over the phone said that IDIOT never submitted and order. Do not go to this location! The staff is made up of incompetent asses!</Review>

Should have received my  visa card with the full value of one of the phones in May. Never did! Jose was my seller, he sold both phones under different contracts, therefore I didn't qualify for the promo. Instead of excepting his error n fixing it. Him n his manager J or Jay ignored my complaint. They thought I was gonna forget abt $700! like  really! who will? They NEVER! return any of my calls, (like they said they would) with any intent of resolving his, their mistake. In the end I called corporate n they helped me with success! Always call corporate.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<date>1487976237567<//date><rate>1<//rate><review>One of the worst T-Mobile center.  Please be careful when buying here because they will lie to you for sales.  It's the culture of the store instead of being an honest 3rd party dealer.  This store reminds me of the Wells Fargo opening multiple false accounts scandal or going to a car dealership.

I came in to buy the new Galaxy s7 edge with my girlfriend.  After grabbing the phone from the back, the associate that helped us started to tell us about the special deals that is "included in the price of the phone".  He showed us all the accessories that we can get and since they did not have screen protector and case in stock, he switched it out for a JBL Bluetooth speaker.  Throughout the whole process, I asked him multiple time is this going to cost any extra or is it free.  His answer was it is "included in the price of the phone".  We also wanted to pay off the phone right at the store but he insisted that in store you can only do EIP monthly payment plan.  THIS IS FALSE, YOU CAN PAY OFF ANY PHONES OR FEES ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR ACCOUNT IN STORE RIGHT AWAY.

We came home only to find out he put all the accessories item on T-Mobile EIP payment plans.  It appeared free because you pay 0 dollar upfront except for the tax but are still responsible for the full price monthly.  We came back to return the items right after finding out and even then a different associate that help us gave us an attitude and a rude look.  Not once did they offered an apology for lying to you.

My advice if you need to go to this T-Mobile store:

- TAKE NOTE OF TYPICAL SALES TACTICS. They will push and not clearly explain to you what is really going on with the transaction.  If you feel uncomfortable about the experience, decline and leave the store or call T-Mobile customer service right at the store and ask them about any questions that you have.

- READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU SIGN.  They purposely print your contract and receipt in small fine print by scaling 4 pages into one.  Other T-Mobile store either do 1 or 2 so it is readable.  The associate will then proceed to flip through everything and ask you to sign at the end.

- Go home and reread the contract again and check your account online to see if there is anything out of the ordinary.  There is a restocking fee for phones but all other items can be return for a full refund.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I came in for a cellspot wi-fi router. I have poor connection at home so this router will help me with my signal and allow me to use wi-fi calling.

Tony the manager refused to let me get one saying I didn't qualify for one. Their website clearly said I was eligible for one. He made one of the employees first say they didn't have anymore when they did.

Tony the manager came to interrupt screaming at me and my family that we don't qualify for one and they do have them. Someone was lying first saying they didn't then they did.

Tony then started saying I didn't qualify for it and that I didn't need it. He kept telling me the computer would say I didn't need it when I have 1 bar of signal at home. Apparently his magical computer knows what I need instead of me.

He refused to tell me so I called T-Mobile support on speaker. The nice lady helped me out telling me I was more than qualified for it and she apologized on speaker for Tony's actions. She waived the fee and mailed out the router I needed.

Do not come here until they fire tony. There was another old man getting abused by another rep trying to get a phone he didn't want.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Liars. I bought a note 8 and they tricked me into saying that I had a case and screen protector when the 2 were actually sold for almost $ 100. I was thinking of buying another cell but for lying I don't buy them from this store. Be careful to do the math on your calculator.

So sad to learn this location will be closing. We love going here to see all the cool stuff from around the world. All the artisan crafts, rare food items from all over the world that you'd only find here, and awesome furniture at decent prices made this place a unique stop and a great place to add character to your home.</text>

The store was set up absolutely beautifully.  There was such an assortment of Halloween, Hello Kitty and amazing Christmas items...everywhere.  And the employees were so fun, helpful and in a great mood.  Way to go.  Stopping in really made my day better.  Thank you!!!< /Review>

Love the taste in decor. The store was nicely laid out, clean, and welcoming. This is my go to store for house hold things. Would be nice if they could apply military discount for us veterans and military members. Over great store. Associates were nice too.< /text>

<Text>I love wandering around this place. There are so many interesting things to see. I spent a good amount of time looking at the cards because there were incredible - great quality with life-applicable greetings. I also found several that rendered me laughing out loud like a freak standing there in the aisle. Their children's books and gifts are creative, funny, and sweet. Paper products/gift wrap are crazy amazing. They've got great pottery and tableware, mix n match lamps and bases, unique pillows and rugs, delicious imported foods and sweets, a great display of international wines, and even furniture. This place is NOT BORING. Check it out, next time you're looking for.... anything.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>I visit this place every once in a while with close family and friends. I always convince them to come back. The place is very well maintained, the employees are kind and I always find something new and interesting every time I visit every couple months or so. Outstanding place to browse around for goodies and unique home decorations. I wish them many years of continued excellence.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I've been here many of times with my wife. This is the kind of store that you go to and you have some time and take the time to look around. We never plan to go over there to buy something in particular but it is amazing we always end up buying something. The merchandise is unique and it is fun to walk around and look at the different things from all around the world. They carry an ice line of International Foods and we always like to try something new. The staff is nice and friendly. The store even though it is filled to the brim is clean and the Isles are easily accessible.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< UserId.>

This store is trouble! I have never walked out empty-handed! The store associates are always very pleasant and helpful. I especially enjoy their selection of foreign foods. It's nice to see lesser known, but delicious, food items from Italy and Germany.<//Text>

<text>I usually do my shopping at Trader Joe's and it was closed so I hung my head and walked over to Cost Plus. However! I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of Christmas gifts they had to offer. And, for signing if I got 20% off!  I broke into my happy dance!!!< /text>< rating>

I like Cost Plus World Market. You can always get some unusual things here. I like a course when they have a sale cuz who doesn't like a sail! I can often find things here that I can't find at the regular supermarkets. I can find things here that she can't find out the regular types of department stores either. Sometimes they can be a little pricey, however because you're looking for some of the unusual items it's really better than having to search all over the place for those items. Although I like Amazon I do like to try to support the local businesses. So if I know they've got something here I can get it right away. It's not too much of a hassle to get there and there's plenty of parking that's free which is an important piece to me. I hate going to Downtown Sacramento celect shop the outskirts. You won't be disappointed in Cost Plus World Market as you can get some nice and usual things and then some of the usual things.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I've been wanting to do this for a long time. I finally did it and I'm very pleased with the result. The technician was well-informed, and gave useful suggestions. It only took about 2 hours to install. It functions perfectly in a space that needed extra lighting. I am looking forward to endless days of sunlight - and moonlight! See before and after pics (I did open blinds a bit for the after pic).<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNM2dkAs-tePREAinBzOUiLnLpAqzWLSqaDRDak=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBM0VWWKWLgNS68wNqsfdahVJ-hreGCLYlisR1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc74fee307a32f:0x4040eb17fa423cc2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>We are very happy and satisfied with the Solatube daylight installation.  The installer, Robert W., did an excellent job and accomplished two installations in under 3 hours.  His demeanor was professional and he answered all of our questions.  Our kitchen and dining room are bright now, exceeding our expectations.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone and especially want to thank Robert for his excellent work.<//Text>< rate>

The finished product exceeds expectations. Chase was polite, communicated clearly, adjusted the size of the Solatube as per my original thoughts and made sure that the location was a good fit with the limitations of the water pipes in the attic. He protected my homes surfaces and carefully placed drop clothes. He cleaned up thoroughly after installation. He explained every step. The only reason for 3 stars is that he inadvertently drilled a hole in my new roof under solar panels. He was not aware that the panels were on the roof and I now will need to have shingles replaced and hopefully will not have to uninstall solar panels to do so. He was very forthcoming about the issue and the company will take care of the invoice for repairs. Once the repairs are complete and invoice covered, I will upgrade my review with additional star(s).

Update: After a couple of months, the repairs to my roof were made and Solatube did pay my roof contractor. They fulfilled their end of the bargain, although not quickly. Because of the difficulty of resolution of the roof problems, I still will deduct 1 star.</text>

Randy is professional, courteous, and polite. Summers are getting hotter and we needed the right solution. Randy explained the science behind a whole house fan system versus purchasing an extra FAU with A/C. I was clear on what I am getting and it's perfect for our situation. I am a builder of high end luxury residential homes (Four by Four Construction, Inc.), and recommend Randy Martin for your whole house fan and Solatube needs. Thanks, David Fargo< /Text>

This is the second time that I've installed solar tubes in my home. They are addicting, I'm telling you! I can't say enough great things about this company and their staff. They are not only courteous, but they are also efficient, and extremely professional all at a great value. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

We needed a whole home air fan. The technician from Solatube gave us the most details and was the most informative when we got quotes from companies. The quality and attention to detail was amazing. We are very happy with the product and service.</review>

A big fan of Solatube.  Doing a remodel in a small condo and the Solartube add just the right amont of light in a dark area.  Needed a filter to dim some of the light and they had a filter to do that.  Very pleased.</text>

<Review>This was a very easy and efficient solution to my dark closet. The whole process was easy from the sales guy I met at the fair to the installer. One cool thing they do is send you texts and emails with a picture of who will be showing up at your door to do the installation. Once he was here I asked for a 2nd tube to be installed in another room and he did it not problem. Would highly recommend.</Review>< pictures>

Robbie Woolley came over to provide a quote for solar tubes for my dark upstairs hallway and guest bathroom. After he explained in detail the advantages of their product and provided a fair quote I decided to move forward. What surprised me is that he came prepared to do the job right then and there. I asked how long it would take- he said 4 hours- well he finished the job in less than that and the outcome was beautiful. The 14 inch solar tubes did the job, and the squared fixtures diffused the light in the hallway and bathroom- it felt like the lights were on. To my pleasant surprise the night lights came on after sunset. This is something I should have done years ago. I would recommend this product and Robbie to anyone. Good job guys. Al.</Review>

I have had four solatubes installed throughout my house. This has been the most professional and service-oriented business I have seen, especially in the home improvement/construction industry. The guys (Sacha, Max, and Ian) were very squared-away - their desire to ensure perfection and quality in everything they did was so impressive and rarely seen these days. Both the product and the accompanying service has thus far exceeded our expectations, and we highly recommend this company to anyone looking to enhance the natural lighting or cooling aspects of their home.<//text>

< Review>
I just had a Solatube installed today in the master bedroom (dark) closet which is bright and clear now !  The people of Solatube in Carlsbad do a great job, they're in and out in no time.  Installation time was just less than 2 hours.  This is the second Solatube I've had installed, and it's always a great experience to deal with.  I am very pleased.< /Review>

<Text>I am very pleased with my new solatubes! My house was very dark before and I put 6 in and it is a game changer. Definitely transformed the energy of the space. Joey was my installer and he was wonderful. Did a great job, advised me on lots of little options and helped me pick the right options and placements for what I was trying to achieve. This is an incredible investment in my home, which will pay off for years to come. And you get a tax credit because these are energy friendly! Highly recommended!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love our new Solatube Whole House Fan.  Robbie, who installed our unit, arrived early, answered all of our questions, discussed how the unit would be installed on our property, and provided information and literature on a 2nd product we inquired about.  We had a simple installation, Robbie had us up and running in less than one hour.  Very professional installation, I highly recommend Solatube, this product and their installation service.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

My relatives held nothing back when they commented how dark my house was.  When we replaced the roof, we installed 6 solatubes, 1 in kitchen, 1 in den area, 1 in master bedroom, 1 in washer/dryer area of garage and 1 each with exhaust fans in the two windowless bathrooms.  Our home is now always cheery and bright.  Also in the windowless bathrooms, it is no longer required to use the lights even in the daytime.  The solatubes are attractive on the roof and also in the ceilings.  I would recomment these to everyone.<//text>

<review>Unbelievable!  What a first rate company.  From the first time I called them, they followed up, confirmed with emails and texts!  They sent out an email with the technician's picture, name and bio.  He was prompt, he called to say he was running late which is all one could ask for.  He was informative, affable and I would do business with this company anytime.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>After trying to get a leaking solar tube repaired for over two years, I finally found Solatube.  They had a person come out in the same week.  Our Solatube installer was knowledgeable, courteous, efficient, fast, and cleaned up after the installation.  He answered all of our questions and told us about tax deductions that could be applied at the end of the year.  He also installed a solar powered attic fan that was not part of the work order, but he had it on the truck and had time to install it.  We are delighted -  very pleased with the whole process,< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>The solatube 160 ISn Round we installed in our bathroom two days ago is much brighter than the replaced old one. It is not only bright enough for the room during the day, but also provides night light which is powered by its solar energy battery. The installation was efficient. It is a very nice experience to have it. Moreover it helps to save energy in order to keep our earth green.</review>< Pics>

Robert came and very quickly examined our home and the locations we were hoping to install the Solatubes and confirmed what was necessary to make it happen.  He was very professional and great to work with.  Love Solatubes and the natural light they are providing to our home!<//text>

<date>1546492114469<//date><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>My house had 3 partially completed units when I bought it.  I took some of the parts in and “Josh” told me that they were indeed from your company.  I scheduled an appointment and had to hurry before the end of the year so that I could get my tax credit.  I told that to the person who was scheduling and he said, “No problem, we will get you your tax credit”.  The tech showed up at my house and informed me that he did not have the estimate, and of course tried to charge me extra.  Luckily I had the estimate in my email.  Then I was told that it would cost more because there were angles involved.  I had told the scheduler that fact, so why was it not in the estimate?  Then I was told that the original equipment was not Solatube, but it could still be done... for extra of course.  Then I was told that he had brought the wrong parts and would have to reschedule.  When I asked if it could be done before the end of the year... wait for it... I was told that I could not get a tax credit for a project “finish”, only for a complete and new project.  I asked him to leave and do not bother with anything with Solatube again.  I have encountered lies, scamming and incompetent employees at every step of the way.  Solatube is a poorly run company with typical employees that do not know their jobs.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The estimators came to my house and very throughly explained the system and the options. They made recommendations based on my needs, and quoted the system. They pointed out energy saving rebates and discounts. At installation, the installer was very friendly and professional. He first reviewed the details of the job, and once we decided on the exact location of the tubes, he covered the surrounding areas with drop cloths and did the installations. He explained the steps as he went, and gave me information about my roof and home condition. Upon completion of the tubes he showed me the details of the night light, cover options, and tubes. He throughly cleaned up. All in all, the system is great. It added light just where we need, so we don't have to turn electric lights on. The look great, and work very well, even on overcast days.</Text>

Our experience with Solatube Home in Vista CA was unsurpassed; from the phone call (and consequent) order placed with Caitlin Kluey, to the installation performed by Joseph Erickson. Both of those employees represent your firm with such professionalism, one hopes their value is recognized. Superb customer service seems to be waining these days. This is not the case with them. We love the quality of the product, the ease of the transaction, the efficiency of scheduling, but most importantly... the craftsman-like pride and careful approach Joseph takes while installing. He completed the installation in one short afternoon. Ultimately, the end product is how a company is measured. Working with your firm was a pleasure.

I received robocalls that this company will be at my house without my permission as well as unwarranted bills without any explanation or date of services, all which appeared to be a scam. I have not signed any contract with this business. I was frightened by a person coming onto my property without written or verbal permission. This person was calling me with "urgent" messages rudely telling me to give him my code to enter my property further. I called my previous pest control service who I paid in a timely manner and I have all receipts. I was then told that my information was sold to this business. I was not given any notice of this. I have asked for no contact with Clark Pest however they continue to send me bills, 3 so far. I do not owe them money. I find them unprofessional and inconsiderate.<//Text>

Customer service is excellent, friendly and responsive. However, I have had them over twice now and still have lots of pest problems. I actually went to Home Depot and purchased 8 ant repellent traps to help because they never went away. Additionally, we have seen more spiders (and very large) this summer than we can ever remember seeing in the past. I will still use them because I am (hoping/assuming) they are doing a little something, but not enough to rate them 5 stars.< /Text>

Professional, nice service people come to spray once a quarter. No bugs. It's working! Much better than when I moved in two years ago - had a home invasion of ants back then. Happy customer here!<//review>

<review>We love Clark Pest Control! Their service is always prompt and the technicians are friendly, professional, and educational. They go above and beyond to clear up any problems we have (and there are lots of problems with our older home that no one took care of for years on the outskirts of town!). We highly recommend Clark!</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I called when my dog caught a mouse in our kitchen and Tim came out the next day. He set up several traps, sprayed outside and said he would come back to monitor them. He is so kind, especially to my 70 lb bully. Murphy knows that when Tim comes he is getting doggy treats! The mice and bugs are GONE and Tim never misses an appointment. I definitely recommend Clark, you won’t be disappointed!<//Review>

<Review>No follow up, does not provide services as initially stated, but sends invoices charging for services they have not performed. I  signed up in August for rodents in my attic they came for 2 days: to clean cobwebs and spray exterior and to set traps in attic in August. Have not seen or heard from Clark but the rodents continue to have fun. Finally,  called yesterday to request follow up, scheduled an appointment for this morning from 10 to 12 PM, no show or call.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1548587407960, 'text': 'Hi Denise.

Reason we called Clark was because of mice getting in the closet wall.  One year later, mice are still in the wall.  Problem not fixed.  They are nice to come and remove the mouse when it is caught and reset the trap!<//Review>

couple days Josh, from Clark, was at my door. He was very friendly & personable with my puppy & my (adult) child gamer.
I was happy with the quote I got, it was a lot less than I expected and he was very patient trying to read my card info to the main office. We got scheduled for our 1st service in the beginning of June. It was the earliest I could fit it in and it was the LONGEST WEEK EVER! Ants, ANTS & more ANTS. We tried to fight them ourselves for a couple months but unlike previous years, NOTHING worked.
After seeing the results only 2 days after Clark treated our house, my family & I wondered why we waited so long. Adam showed up on the day & time I picked and was just as friendly and easy going as the 1st person. I couldn't have asked for better service.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We had a year contract with Clark Pest. The service was good, however, when the year contract expired, they came to our home and no one was home and they performed the service only at outside of the home as our backyard door was locked. They can not perform service only in the front of the house and charge us. They should realize that we do not want the service from them.<//Review>

They told me the bugs would survive in cool moist places so I asked...Why did you not spray under the house (we have a raised foundation)? That is the largest moist and cool place on my property but they had no good reason.  Instead they came back and sprayed the same places as before.  I suppose I could have guessed the good reasons, 1) Too dirty  2) Too hard  3) Too cramped.  The termite guys got under there looking for business why could'nt you.  So if you want bugs coming back a week after spraying CALL CLARK PEST CONTROL.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1548588049249, 'text': 'Repeated treatments are often required.

<Review>Busy on a Sunday is kinda normal but on a labor day Sunday with long weekend?! I see it a chance to get extra work done. I was excited to do it but had to wait too long for customer service.  Everyone like it now and fast and I'm the same but I also hate lines.  Open counters with an associate is what I expect from my favorite stores, (Home Depot, O'Reilly and Save Mart).  Step it up because online shopping is weird and strange.</Review><userid>103989660973398285535</userid><date>1567358615308</date><Response>None< /Response>< rate>

I gave One star only because the app wouldn't let me give no stars. If u need parts for your car or truck use any place but O'Reilly in Riverbank california 😕<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Spark plug manufacturers use different numbers and complicated scales to designate plug heat ranges. The ladies on duty researched and gave me a set of Autolite 437/ 83 plugs. Later comfirmed those were hottest ones available for the Ford 8N. So far no more plug fouling.
Thanks for the stick-to-itiveness researching the correct solution.< /review>

I thought I would come here because they were able to order me a part without me going in to pay for it before hand. When I came in today they ordered the.part I didn't need. I specifically told them I didn't need the part with the motor which of course cost more. If I don't need it Im not paying for it. I had also told him the part was cheaper at the competitor and he said no problem. So he knew exactly which one I needed. This is so ridiculous. They offered a discount which I was still paying $25 more.  They wouldn't be able to get me the part for a week. It had to be special orders which I should have been told that in the first place instead of wasting my time. I have to inconvenience someone who was doing me a favor to fix this for me. Let's just say the competitor across the street has my business from now on. I will not return.< /Text>

They constantly mess up my order. I ask for double sauce and get the dryest pizza ever. The pick up service had never gone well. Calling their number and using their app is pointless. Just go up and knock so you don't wait for 15 minutes</Review>

Ashley deserves a raise." Everything from ordering it ( being my first time)over my phone ". To it coming out just like, I like it.!!!!
The delivery was also, " on point". Thanks for a good evening.< /review>

<Text>It wasn't bad but the kind of skimped of the ingredients. For example I got extra cheese and peppers in addition to other topings and it was barely anything. Like... I understand toppings need to be kept to a certain amount so the pizza cook properly (I worked for a pizza place ik the drill) but even this was excessively little. The crust left something to be desired. Great hot wings tho.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

This is just about the ONLY Domino's I order from anymore. You don't have to believe me, but BELIEVE ME when I say they do it right!!! It's always ready early or on time and to perfection. Lots off toppings, perfect temp, friendly and courteous- definitely an A+, all-star establishment! Kudos to the manager of this location. BRAVO and WELL-DONE!</Text>

<Review>I ordered using the app,I asked for curbside delivery, followed the directions given: replied "HERE"( twice) and put vehicle hazards waited for a total of 15 minutes after I was told order was ready. Nobody came to my vehicle nor did I receive a call stating my order was ready. I was parked DIRECTLY in front of Domino's, with the hazards on. You would think that since this is their protocol that an employee would have come to the vehicle and asked if I had gotten my order or they could have checked the orders to see if someone had a curbside delivery. I understand this a weird time we are all going through, but I did everything on my end. Had I not gotten out who knows how long my order would have been sitting there...... NOT AT ALL PLEASED!!!!! Also had a coupon for the 3 for 5.99 special and the pizza was$ 6.49! How does that work?? My pasta was dry and had three pieces of chicken in it.......</Review>< pics>

This is got to be the most dysfunctional Domino's location, the order is never ready when the app claims it's ready, the staff always seem to have an attitude and make excuses.

I tried this location again (unfortunately) thinking that maybe they changed but I was once again disappointed. I'm getting to the point that I think DOMINOS doesn't care that certain stores perform so poorly that they create customers that will shy away from the brand not just the location.<//Review>

The other day the website wouldn't let me order pizza. It let me order everything but lol. I called in, and Ryan helped me with my order. His customer service skills and wonderful and fun demeanor ended up in me ordering more food and those cookie brownie things. Thank you Ryan!</text>

< review>
Horrible customer service! Theres no reason they should have such horrible attention to detail. I went to pick up a pizza and the cashier gave me the complete wrong order. When I called them they said they will make it over and deliver in 35min..this was at 615pm, at 656pm I get a call from someone else saying they cant deliver to my address. Put me on hold then hang up on my face. Not once have I been able to speak with a supervisor, they just keep changing people on the phone for the mistake they created. When I called back because they hung up, they said "well we put a credit on your file, we arent delivering" then put me on hold for more than 15min. This is completely ridiculous!!</review>

Pizza good but costumer service wack . Never have a cashier when I go pick up,  you see like 10 employees. Like I just waited 40 min for you to make it, don't want to wait 30 more just to pay.< /Review>

Really good and nice. Just kindof annoyed that when i was in the place they took a couple minutes before they could help me even when i was the only one ordering (3 people could have helped) I can understand they might be busy. Still customer service was nice, food came hot and ready to eat, and everything that i ordered was right.< /text>

<Review>Waited fifty minutes in store for our pizza. I don't know if that time estimation machine is overridden or what but it said twelve minutes and our name disappeared after twelve minutes. There were at least five people on staff just standing around casually discussing how they got a couple of orders wrong before we came and they would move around but weren't actually DOING anything.

Eventually someone said that the pizza was "lost" which is a lie because noone was even in the pizza prep area during the time we sat staring right into where they were idly standing around. Even then it wasn't twelve minutes it was almost twenty minutes to make the pizza they forgot.

Then the guy who brought us the pizza was so jaded or high looking. Bloodshot eyes and a thousand yard stare who emotionlessly apologized for the "lost" pizza.

I think them using the word lost to describe just not doing the pizza order was the most annoying thing.<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>I'm a Vegetarian and when my wife is busy we like to order domino's every other domino's place I've went to has gotten my order right but everytime we order here they bother our order and/or forget something. Everytime We order Cheesy Breadsticks they forget the Mariana sauce. Another time they gave us the wrong pizza and side. They also don't read our special instructions saying  "Please Clean the pizza cutter so no meat get on our pizza." I love domino's as a pizza place but this place just has the worst service<//Review>< Pics>

Cnt relate to all the bad reviews. Love coming to this Dominos and not jst because it's closest to My spot. Nvr had a major prob, beside the driver forgetting My ceasar dressing for salad one time (I dnt play about My ceasar salad y'all 😁) but hey We all make mistakes sometimes. Wait time is nvr too long and Customer Service is great with Me, no complaints.< /text>

<Text>On Saturday evening, Dario offered me an outstanding customer service. He completely went above and beyond to ensure my Domino's experience was valued. No matter how hectic the work environment got he made sure I was given a wow service while awaiting my pizza order and that I will continue to order Domino's. You have won my trust and loyalty. Thank you Dario and the whole Domino's team.< /Text><user_name>Jay Pereda<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

There are better run domino's pizza locations. The employee's are to busy messing around to care about customers. Sad because the manager was even encouraging the horseplay.</Text>

Yes , there were occasions when the pizza was not up to par , due to employee error(s): burnt , lack of ingredients , etc etc. That's not the Corporations fault totally , it's the site who hires inadequate workers , who have no compassion for the customer and are only there for a paycheck . They could use some more training in the " Customer Service " department too . Overall statistically speaking , they have passed the test , as far as being a decent substitute for  late night munchies . Just treat people the way YOU want to be treated !<//review>< Time>

<text>WARNING!!!! STAY AWAY!!! TOTAL GARBAGE for "food", INCOMPETENT & RUDE staff(for one, in about an HOUR of waiting to get my money BACK for SPOILED FOOD, which gave me FOOD POISONING, not a SINGLE one of them EVER washed their HANDS, even after handling MONEY, & were NO gloves either!), & that "food" WILL make you SERIOUSLY ILL: LAST time I ate there, gave me one HELLUVAH FOOD POISONING, & THEY REFUSED to REFUND my money, & just wanted to play games INSTEAD for almost TWO HOURS!!! & I JUST wanted the money for the PIZZA that POISONED me(I threw up for TWO days!!!) back, & wasn't even gonna ask for the desert(that was BRICK-HARD, by the way!) refund, or even the TIP that I gave the driver! The time before THAT food FIASCO: they deliver HALF of the WRONG FOOD, that was WAY TOO spicy for ME to even EAT, & what I COULD eat was the TOTALLY COLD Carbonara Pasta(GROSSEST thing EVER, btw!)! However, because he finally SHOWED UP at almost MIDNIGHT(I'm LESS than HALF A MILE from them, too, on a MONDAY, & NOT a holiday... after almost 2 & a 1/2 HOURS of WAITING!?!), HE told me he "couldn't DO anything about it, since it was NOW closed, & didn't feel like taking it all BACK"(he just took the SO SPICY chicken back, which hurt my NOSE to even SMELL it = how I KNEW it was a WRONG item!), & HE left me the COLD as all hell Pasta dish, as some sort of a "consolation" for all that waiting  AND getting only HALF my order at all, of which I could only eat a couple of fork-fulls, since it was, by then, ICE COLD & DISGUSTING! The NEXT day I was too busy, so I went to get my money BACK(I paid by CARD: MY fault, I suppose?!?)that Wednesday, & they also REFUSED to DO anything about it, even after that DRIVER TOLD them that what I was saying WAS indeed CORRECT/TRUE, but play GAMES, as seems to be their "norm"! & to make it ALL even WORSE? My CARD number "mysteriously" got stolen, which, of course, I couldn't PROVE with 100% CERTAINTY was THEM, BUT I used IT no place else! SCREW that place, don't do any business with them!<//text>< Pics>

I used the app to order a "build your own pizza" and it just placed an order for a plane cheese pizza. after calling the store and speaking with the manager " Yasmin" she corrected the order with no hassle and even tossed in some complimentary bread sticks. Good customer service.</Text>

Rude customer service from the manager, Ashley.
I went to pick up food with my friend that use to work there and once the manager saw my friend she told another worker to help us instead of her helping us, I’m not coming here again, costumer service is awful!< /text>

I ordered my pizza on my dominos app, which is the best way to order!  However, when I arrived to pick up my pizza I had to wait about 10 mins because the app doesn't operate in "real-time".  But the staff is super polite and the pizza was hot and super fresh...< /text>

Call and place order for 3 lg pizzas at 7 pm, at 8.30 pm no boddy come, my kids ar starving, call lady answer , we are very busy, your pizzas are not made jet , it will take 40 more minutes before your order is in the oven, can’t believe it, got in my car , drive to the store,  phones are ringing, the girl is taking more orders, 10 persons are in the waiting room waiting for their order , other people are also complaining couse they been waiting for over one and a half hours too, A BUNCH OF GUYS AND GIRLS PLAYING IN SIDE DE PLACE INSTEAD OF MAKING THE PIZZAS AND THEY KEEP TAKING ORTHERS WITHOUT TELLING THE CUSTOMERS THAT IT WILL TAKE AS LONG AS TWO HOURS FOR THEIR PIZZAS TO BE READY.

I ordered a pasta bowl from them with no chicken and extra alfredo sauce and they charged me for extra but their was no extra sauce when it came half the pasta was burnt oh and the bowl wasn't even half way full . To bad I can't post the picture on here of what I got paid 6.99 plus for the extra sauce and  for what I got I could have gone else where it's disappointing.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Leave much to be desired and they put less ingredient to the pizza if it continues like this would be no longer an option

(Original)
Deja mucho que desear ya le ponen menos ingrediente ala pizza si sigue así dejara de ser una opcion</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is the worst pizzeria in all of Long Beach, I should give them - 5 stars, for the bad service and the orrible attitude that one of the people in charge of the place has. After they make you wait more than 1 hour, they still get upset because you ask them. And another thing that is not right is that they don't even give you a receipt. Horrible place, I never ever buy from this place again.

(Original)
Es la peor pizzeria de todo long Beach, les debería de poner - 5 estrellas,por el mal servicio y la orrible actitud que tiene una de las encargadas del lugar. Despues de que te hacen esperar mas de 1 hora ,todavia se molestan porque les preguntas . Y otra cosa que no está bien es que ni siquiera te dan recibo. Horrible  lugar ,nunca jamás vuelvo a comprar en este lugar.<//text>< resp>

Ashley did an amazing job. My son has had a few haircuts before, and he always ends up with pieces sticking up, blunt bangs, or stylists who aren't equipped for little guys and have to abandon mid-cut. This place is prepared for the littles, skilled, and patient. We will be back!< /text>

What isn't to love about EJ's little people? The stylists are great with the kids and cutting hair. They keep the shop clean and kid friendly. Thanks a bunch!< /text>

Very friendly staff! They did a great job on my 9 & 5 year old daughters, as well as my 1.5 year old son. Will definitely go back again. And the kids loved playing on their fun toys.< /Review>

Went in for our son’s first haircut today. It was such a great experience. He was a little unsure but she did an amazing job working with him. They’ve got a cute first cut package with before and after photos as well as a small locket of hair. Highly recommend!</review>

<text>Yes this place is super kid friendly and they do a "first haircuts" special where they do before and after pictures, saving locs of hair, and a certificate. However, the quality of the actual haircut was absolutely terrible. They cut my daughter's hair SO uneven. It was so bad. Now we have to go to another place and get it fixed which will now end up costing $50 total for my toddlers hair. I don't even spend that much on my own hair😠<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>This place is AMAZING. My grandson was a little squirrely for his 1st hair cut, but the lady was Extremely patient and took her time. She even stopped a few times to allow for pictures. So grateful my grandson had an awesome experience for his 1st cut. And the decor is adorable.</Text><rating>5<//rating>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1530465923534</Time><Review>Highly not recommended. My son had his first haircut here and they didn’t know how to properly approach a 18mo with his first haircut. My son was crying scared of the hairdresser and the razor and the lady said, if i let my kid take a break from cutting hair, she won’t finish his haircut and that was not even close to being done. We ended up leaving even if his hair was not properly cut. Also so expensive. We had the certificate too and even the before and after picture was so blurry. If i could give negative stars, i would. Staff should be trained in how to handle kids. I thought i was in for a great haircut experience for my son but no. More like traumatizing. You’d expect more for a “little people” salon. Negative stars!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Ashley did such a fantastic job! Super cute place with lots of toys for the kids. My son has a very unique headshave due to a complicated birth but they did such a good job. I was so scared my son was going to freak out because he barely ever lets me cut his hair but he did totally fine here! Wonderful experience. We'll be coming back again soon<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI241wYfXn3ayObzFrXiBVilGuVCXwD7y4RIYX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< name>

The only reason why I didn't rate them five stars is because the haircuts my son received varied greatly depending on the stylist, regardless of previous notes. I'd say certain stylists definitely have better skill sets than others.<//Review>< Pics>

The lady cut my 18 month old hair, she was real nice and patient, and it was my son first hair cut so he cry and move lots! The place is nice for the kiddos my son had fun playing for a little bit!I definitely recommend this place for fist time hair cut.</Review>

<Text>I appreciate that she listened to what I wanted for my sons hair. She took from me what I wanted while inserting her expertise to give a very nice cut. Yes it's not cheap, but if you care  about a nice cut you will pay for it. I'll be going back!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>I've been taking my three kids here for a few years,at different ages, from one year old to 9, not exclusively because of the inconsistency in the service. Sometimes they did good, sometimes they did pretty bad. Choppy, uneven cut, not understanding what I wanted. They are nice and patient, but there is some attitude if the owner doesn't know you.
It's OK if you're in a rush,but don't expect extraordinary. And they are pricey! I paid $19.50 plus tip for a baby's haircut! And the place can use some serious cleaning!<//review><rating>3<//rating>< Pictures>

Shelly is AMAZING. My 2 year old sits still for her and she does a FANTASTIC job. We drive 20 minutes to come here because of how great they are. They do charge a few dollars more than others, but it's worth it. Like they say, you get what you pay for right??  I highly recommend EJ's.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>I had taken my older two kids to EJ's years ago for their haircuts while growing up.  They always loved going there and playing in the kid-friendly environment while they waited.  I then took my two younger kids (now teenagers) when they were small and they always had a great experience, also.  The stylists really know how to handle kids and give great cuts!  I now find myself going back with my teenage son since he couldn't find anyone else that could cut his hair as good as Shelly!  The strangest thing for me is seeing Shelly cut my grandkid's hair several times now, too!  EJ's has become a family tradition.  Thanks, guys, for caring so much about kids!</text>< Pictures>

This was my baby's second hair cut and I was not very pleased with this shop. I walked in and noticed it was 22 dollars for the hair cut and I always tip so it ended up being 27 dollars for my 11 month old to get a trim. Ridiculous but I had an appointment so I wasn't just going to leave.  Instead of using a normal booster seat, a wooden plank was propped over the chair handles and I was so worried the entire time that my baby was going to fall forward and onto the ground. So, I stood rite in front of him throughout the whole cut.  I think he got nicked a couple of times because he would just start crying out of nowhere which he doesn't normally do and didn't do at all during his first hair cut.  Lastly the haircut was awful... pieces of hair that got missed with the clippers, completely uneven lines on his face, didn't style his hair at all! I walked away thinking this haircut wasn't worth a dollar.<//review>

Really cool spot downtown next to LLLReptile. The woman inside was really welcoming and sweet. Girl boss energy for sure. Covid precautions are in in play, and they seemed to have a huge variety of products. Saw that they carry a lot of GRAV products too. Helped me find something similar to what I usually use, and it was cheaper than what I usually use too!  Coming back for sure.< /text>

Rep was SO helpful, great recommendations. The pricing was awesome too, not too much above online. Plus I’m not having to pay/wait for shipping. 10/10 experience! Thank you!

Great shop, but a little pricey compared to other stores. Good variety of juice and vapes.</Review>

The staff is all so cool, if you sign up for their little Rewards program you get all kinds of discounts texted to you, convenient location right on Grand you can always grab some lunch nearby and pick up your juice or coils or whatever. Made the mistake of going to a different local shop one day and will never make that mistake again.

<Response>None<//Response><text>I bought a Halo starter kit pen. I was looking for a cheap vape to hold me over until payday. I asked for the generic battery and tank setup and the employee informed me about the kits for sale and also how the battery was better even though he lost money in the process. Another employee helped me find a cheap E Juice and when I told her I like a lot of nicotine in mine she was able to add more nicotine to the juice for cheap. The vaporizer works great and I'm super happy with my e-juice. Both the employees were super helpful I didn't catch their names unfortunately but I'll definitely will be going back. Great store, great selection, super customer service oriented.</text>< user>

I have walked in when they have been very busy before, knowing exactly what I want and they were able to get me what I needed while still paying attention to everyone else. My go to flavor is Rip Tide, I recommend everyone try it if you have not done so already. The staff is very personable, they know my name as well as my go to flavor, so I am always in and out, especially when I am in a hurry. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Cbd selection is decent. Amount of e liquid options aren’t that great. The problem is the price, $22 to $30 for a 30ml of e liquid is outrageous when alot of vape shops do 2 60ml or 120ml for $30 deals as a business staple.
Definitely overpriced with a small selection Of e juice.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Very down to Earth, they go out of their way to make sure you find exactly what you're looking for. They all know the workings of vapes inside and out, they truly are experts. One of them, after I thanked him profusely for saving me a whole lot of money, said he's just happy to help people get off cigarettes. I will shop here as long as I can.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff with great customer service. Great selection of both premium juices and top quality hardware. I visited the other local shops and was underwelmed. Stopped by Cloud-9 three times so far and was impressed every time, and left with juices and mods that were perfect for my needs, based upon spot-on recomendations by their staff. Only thing you will not find there is an RDA culture and couches full of cloud-chasers, which is perfect for me, as I am just a simple MTL and new Sub Ohm user. Can't say enough about the staff...great people!<//review>

BJ is a super cool guy and very knowledgeable. He spends time with you as a friend not just a customer. His assistant is very cool and knowledgeable as well. Shop is small and quaint and clean. BJ has one of if not thee biggest juice inventory I've ever seen. My wife and I drive down all the way from Ramona to patronize his store. Keep up the good work Cloud nine, y'all rule.

I've tried to order large bottles of a particular Brand I liked on several occasions from the owner Mike . The first time I ordered it was fine . The second time I ordered I was told by Mike that " it takes awhile... up to a month " . After two months I finally asked about my order and was told " oh we got the shipments in but they didn't send your order" "sometimes that happens " , " nothing we can do about it" ! Mike told me .
Mike then says "I'll order you two large bottles this time " , " should be about 3 to 4 weeks".
So after 5 weeks I go in the store and enquire about my order and the girl at the counter checks the "order book" , and tells me it's in the book but was Never Ordered !!!! Mind you I go in to this store every 10 to 12 days to buy juice or coils which usually ads up to $50 or more and I always ask if my order came in , and I'm always told " nope hasn't come in yet " !!!!
This guy Mike will lie to your face , so you keep buying these tiny bottles off of him instead of selling you the large bottles at a cheaper cost !
I am always loyal to the places I shop no matter the store I go to, but this guy is Not a loyal seller to his patrons... beware of this place !</text>

I started off with Halo Vapor's Captain Jack to get me started, then switched to Cloud 9's PWC (peaches, watermelon, cantaloupe). They also have everything from cheap starter kits to custom set-ups.

Highly recommend this shop.</text>< pics>

<text>My go to vape shop! I always feel welcomed everytime I go to the shop. No matter who is working they're always happy to help answer any questions you may have about any products. They have a huge selection of premium juices to choose from and a huge selection of house juices which are just as good if not better than the premium juices.< /text>< UserId.>

This place is very convenient, and the staff is mostly friendly. The tall, skinny white guy with pretentious grunge hair is unbelievably rude, though. They overcharge grossly for the products, unfortunately, and are extremely skilled at upselling. Order your vape stuff online, if you can.< /text>

<text>I went in during cruising gand and they were super busy but I still got the best customer service ever. The whole stuff was friendly and knowledgeable but I got to say Robert was by far the best. I was a first time buyer and didn't know Jack about it except I knew I wanted to quit cigs. They expanded everything I needed to know plus answered any question with ease. Lots of flavors to choose from. Great job cloud 9</text>< Gmap_id>

The staff is friendly and they don't try and take advantage.
The staff is always trying to make the customer understand why they need certain items.</text>

Amazing place. Amazing people!! Great place for everyone who is new to vaping to people who are pros! Bought a Joyetech Kit from Cloud 9, and continue to stop in once a week to purchase new Juice! If you're having problems with your piece, they're always accommodating! Will definitely continue to recommend them to Friends and Family and will always keep them as my number 1 vape store!!</Text>

To start, I dont go to any other shop. Not even their San Marcos location. (mainly distance) . Seth, Brooke, Romae, JB, Linda, Mike, Robert, you guys have taught me more than tried to upsell me. telling me bells'n'whistles like oh you dont need that, to try and help save money. AND TY SETH AGAIN THE STRUGGLE IS REAL. All in all if you stop by this shop the only way youll leave an unhappy camper is if you walk in broke... from building coils and cotton to teaching me how to do my own, again ty seth for putting up with me and cotton every other day. And the PATIENCE they have... i spent a good hour and a half taste testing, their selection is enourmous, and they all have the knowledge to help you hunt that certain flavor, and they even smiled once they saw the look of magnificence on my face when i found TimeBomb's TNT. like i said i dont go anywhere else, and I dont need to.< /Text>

Staff is friendly, prices are not reasonable considering the prices of the same size bottle and brand at the other two capes shops in the area. Stopped going here after I discovered the other two vape shops in town.< /review>

In a weird way, the way the store "feels" is comforting to me. It's clean and organized but doesn't feel sterile. The prices are decent and range of products is good. As with any of this type of store, the quality of some items is less than perfect, but you need to expect that when shopping discount stores.< /text>

<text>Certain items you get at cheaper price than other stores. Shoppers be wary since they became a 99+ store, some items you can get cheaper at Food 4 less, Winco's or Walmart. It's always best to shop around for the best deals.<//text>< response>

I have been going to this office for 13 years now. And each time, Lucy and her front office has greeted me and by boys, with a smile. She knows me and my boys by first name basis, and to me that means a lot, that they take the time to really know you, and not just hurry up and dismiss you. All the doctors have been super wonderful and knowledgeable, I never have no worries of which doctor sees my kids that day, because they all do a great job of explaining what procedure is being done. Although I would say, location could use a little remodel, other than that, everything else makes up for the difference.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I've been coming here since my son was born (3 years now) staff is friendly and polite. If you have any questions or concerns they are more than happy to answer them for you. Doctors are great! Never had any issues with them. Before covid they had cookies for the kiddos on your way out which was nice, my son would enjoy them, overall would recommend.<//text>< Date>

They are always so friendly and prompt. Always call for reminders (which I very much need). Welcoming at all times. Sanitary and seating distance especially in time of need due to covid. My son is 7 and has been going since first newborn appt.</text>

South Area Pediatrics Medical is the best clinic. The clinic has the best care for patients. They assist you with any concern that you have. The entire team at South Area Pediatrics Medical are very friendly.<//Review>

I give it 5 stars because the staff are always so friendly. I would recommend them to anyone. I take my child here because the staff are always welcoming, from the front desk receptionist, m.a, and dr. Everyone is great. :)</text>

The Dr. and staff deserve 10 stars, but the condition of the clinic itself is bad. Very run down, almost apocalyptic. Again I can't stress enough how awesome the staff is. The Dr. has listened to all of my concerns and helped me be at ease.< /Text>

Took my daughter for a newborn check up , it’s pigeons flying in the hallway . No running water in the exam Rooms . The doctor did not wash her hands . Entered the room with gloves on and went DIRECTLY to her next patient in same said gloves . I would NOT recommend this place to my worst enemy .
Only positive thing was the office staff is extremely nice and respectful .</Review>

Look I dont know why appointment are set when they're not following.   And how its it possible  that everyone one after me has seen a doctor and going about their day . You get ask for something and if you dont have it because they dont feel like walking a few feet to pull your file it feels like yours waiting another  hour for nothing and this will be your 4th time here gladly will be taking my child to a much better establishment  now that she has insurance.< /Text>

<username>Lalissa Green</username><Date>1557517143824</Date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I would give negative stars if possible , I’m surprised no one has called health code violations for this place. Dirty  fingerprints all over the walls the doors are grungy the floor looks like it hasn’t been mopped in 20 years the sinks inside the patients rooms don’t work. They have dry water around the sinks with the little room to move around what so ever wherever you’re at in that building. Absolute disgust and will definitely be getting a different doctors office. Also told me they had  no other different locations when a couple months ago I took my twins to a different location that they referred me to.  Unprofessional slums<//text>< pictures>

<Text>1 star is a compliment for this dump. For starters, It looks abandoned, run down and unsanitary. The receptionist was nice, but the gay guy and the Indian woman doctor are VERY ghetto and unprofessional. Not fit to bring newborns here or any child for that matter, I do not wish this place on my worst enemy. Someone should consider calling the health department or something. It's just not right<//Text><gmap_id>0x809acf939452882d:0x515373edb4f266d0<//gmap_id><userid>106056621695907607100</userid><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>1< /Rate>< response>

I have to wait for those people who is late for their appointment to waste mine time when I am on time for my child appointment. Please do me a favor and reschedule their appointment.

The place looks like an abandoned shopping center. The wait was super long. We finally get called back and it is disgusting. So unsanitary I didn't want to set my baby down. There wasn't even soap in the exam room. It looked like the walls had 20+ years of grim on them. The exam table even had dust and dirt in the crack. I will not be coming back here again.</review>

<text>Horrible! Doctors are mediocre, nurses don't care, receptionists are rude. Youre going to be waiting an hour after your appointment time. They keep refusing to see my two month old claiming she has separate insurance that she doesn't. Office is run down. Looks nothing like pictures. They let sick kids sneeze all over mine. I saw them for a year and a half and regret it. Word of advice: do not go here. Take your time to someone who will appreciate you and your kid! You will hate yourself after going here once!</text>< name>

<Gmap_id>0x809acf939452882d:0x515373edb4f266d0<//Gmap_id><review>Very unorganized and unprofessional. Never got reminders for appts, and would go in on appts already made only to say my son can't be seen by the Dr. This happened the previous 3 appts which is exhausting. My son got sick a lot and he could never be seen, had to take him to emergency every time. They were out of stock with immunizations and said they would call when they were in, NEVER got called for 3 months. I had to go in, only for them to say they couldn't see him and that they BARELY got immunizations which is why they never called... I was finally able to go in for his 4 month appt to finally get him immunizations only for them to say sorry he's not our patient anymore, you need to call your insurance.  I wish they would call ahead of time to let us know rather than constantly waste people's time. The area is very ghetto as well,  rooms are molding, just seems unsanitary. NEVER going here again, DO NOT recommend this place at ALL.< /review>< Pics>

I've had a bad experience coming here, although the assistants and doctors have been nice, I don't feel they're actually listening to what I'm actually telling them, I've given themail the benefit of a doubt with my 3 youngest children, and I'm just done, completely exhausted and more frustrated.< /Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I have been taking my son to his place since he is been 3 months and the place looks rundown and abandoned the nurses and doctors may be nice but sometimes the doctors don't really listen to you and I got here at 9:15 and I haven't seen the dr. Yet it is 10:21 now I don't mind waiting to see the doctor but I got in really really early so I don't know how much earlier I can get it but this is ridiculous I'm going to try to go to a different place but this place the nurses may be nice but you know what this place is run-down and old and disgusting< /review>< Pics>
