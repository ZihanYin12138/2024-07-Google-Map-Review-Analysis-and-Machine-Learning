< review>
Joe did an amazing job with the service. Best plumbing service I’ve ever experienced in my life. I would recommend this company to anyone I know for their plumbing needs. Joe came out, attempted to unclog my kitchen and took additional steps to diagnose my issue. Unfortunately we weren’t prepared at the moment to spend more on the repair but we definitely would recommend the service to family/friends. What a great representative of Elite Rooter Joe was couldn’t ask for a better plumber.< /review>

Found company on google. Called Saturday and had someone come out today, Monday morning.
Jose showed up. Super nice guy. He put covers over his shoes before walking in then he put down a thick paper where he was walking. He was very polite. He cleared the drain for $79. All went as expected. Will use again.</Text>

<response>None<//response><Text>First of all, this company has a very quick response! They send a repair person instantly! This is so so so so important for us cause sewer and toilet problems cannot wait, otherwise there will more damages.

The repair person is highly professional, very very nice and kind! Seeing him so good at his job really help to ease my anxiety over the broken toilets.

He did full inspection for us, a quick and professional repair and replacement for the toilet, in a very reasonable price!
He also sent us repair clarifications, pictures and future recommendations after he finished his job! And the company stuff are also very happy and patient while assisting the repair person on paperwork.

Overall, this is a very pleasant experience, the best I’ve ever had! I will definitely recommend this company!< /Text>< username>

< Review>
They came out, did some diagnostics with equipment, which results ended up to be false, as verified by another plumbing company. Paid $1000 for initial work with company's promise to have that money be put towards the additional work that was "needed". They did not show up the next day. Called the company many times with no return calls. Do not use this service.

05/24/21 update: Called office back after receiving a reply to this post, talked to 2 people, and the answer is still  "not sure there's anything we can do".</Review>

<review>Rafael was the main representative who came over to my home on two separate occasions.

He is very knowledgeable and friendly.  His work quality is top notch and Rafael is the first name I think of now when I have a plumbing issue.

Scott, the Regional Manger and Mike, the Manager also came by my home to inspect the sewer drain pipe to diagnose the reasons for my clog.  Their experience and wealth of knowledge was very impressive!  All three are true pros!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

Both Jiovanni and Kyle were most helpful and explained what they were doing. They were unable to fix the pipe as it had collapsed. I need to check with my HOA as who is responsible and if I am I will be calling Elite back to do the work. They are the best.< /text>

He ran all the test showed us all his findings and then fixed the problem! We would definitely use Elite Rooter again in the future should I come across any other plumbing issues and would refer Elite to all my friends and family who might be in need of a plumber!

We had Elite Rooter come out and service our backed up kitchen. Joe was very knowledgeable and fast with his work. He made sure he wore booties inside my home, laid out some protective paper to cover my floors and did an amazing job clearing my drains. I'll make sure to use Elite Rooter for any future plumbing issues.</review>

Arnold showed up in record time to my home to diagnose what I thought was a plumbing issue in my kitchen. Turns out it was a non-plumbing issue. He was courteous and honest in his evaluation of the problem. I will certainly call Elite again for any future plumbing needs!< /text>

We had a great experience with Elite Rooter.  Both Juan and Rafa were very responsive, knowledgeable, courteous, and professional.  Ultimately, our landlord opted to use someone from their home warranty policy, but when we become homeowners in the new future, we know who to call!  Thank you Elite Rooter!<//review>

Julio went above and beyond to unclog my sewer line.  He NEVER gave up on the stoppage and had a professional attitude the entire time. He explained what he was doing every step of the way. I most definitely will recommend Elite Rooter to anyone I know that needs a professional plumber.</Review>

Julio did a great job of identifying where the clog was located and cleaning it out. He communicated what was going on well. Finally he spent extra time cleaning up under the sink cabinet from the spray from the snake. Overall very satisfied with his work.< /Text>

The service from Julio was simply amazing.  He was super nice, fixed the issue and left the bathroom cleaner than he found it.  He noticed that I was missing two gaskets and immediately got them and installed them.  Little things like that often go unnoticed by some but not by Julio.  Seriously great experience.  How often do you get to say that about a plumber?  Elite in Orange is my new go to plumber.<//Text>

<Review>There are a lot of choices when it comes to plumbing service and I am so happy I chose Elite Rooter!  From the initial phone call I felt well take care of.  Rafa was right on time and assessed the problem right away.  He let me know up front my options and fixed the problem really fast.  I wish I would have called him sooner instead of trying out home remedies for the past week!  Not only did he unclog the pipe, but he left everything in better shape than when he started.  I will definitely be keeping Elite and Rafa in my contacts should I need their service again.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dcd79eabf0bc35:0x3088c5ad91b1aea6</Gmap_id></record>

<review>I needed a repair and maintenance service on my tankless water heater. I searched on Yelp for a local business that could provide the necessary service. I sent a message with my needs to multiple companies and Elite Rooter responded  quickly thru Yelp. After a couple of messages back and forth for more details, Jason the local Manager was at my house within 2 hours. Great guy, extremely knowledgeable and all repairs were done quickly and correctly at a very fair price.

I highly recommend Elite Rooter for any and all your plumbing and water heating needs!</review><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>The CA< /user_name><review>This was not the 1st company that I reached out to for help. Actually, they were the last!

They were the 1st to contact me though, 3 of the other "top rated" companies still haven't contacted me, and at this very moment I am hitting the 13th hour from the point when I first started trying to get help. All of those places that advertised 24 hour assistance, didn't give 24 hour assistance. Did I read it wrong? Maybe they meant it would be at least 24 hours before they start their assistance process?

It started with a nice call from the person that sets up the appointment slots. The first 2 afternoon slots wouldn't work for me because I work swing shift. She managed to slip me into a 10am to 12pm slot.

I received a call from the Senior Technician at 11:01 am, he said that he would be at my parents place in 20 minutes. I am going to call my parents Senior Technician, R.G.! I don't know if the gentleman wants his name posted, I should have asked, but I was pushing that window of time and it didn't even come to mind. R.G. knows who he is, his employers should know who he is too, hopefully when you ask for R.G., you will get the same Senior Technician that saved the day, the weekend, the month of March, and so on, for my parents!

So R.G. called at 11:01 am, he said he would be here in 20 minutes, he knocked on my parent's front door at 11:15 am. I took him into the bathroom to show him the dilemmas! Normally I can get things flowing again for my parents in 15 to 20 minutes, not this time. None of the regular things an average person does for their messed up toilets worked. Not only could I not help resolve the problem, the problem was getting worse and worse by the hour!

I showed R.G. how the toilet wasn't working, then how it has been messing up the bath tub and shower next to it, and how the shower in the 2nd bathroom has started doing the same nasty thing the bath tub that is next to the messed up toilet is doing. It's All Bad!

R.G. looked everything over, then he started running scenarios for me. I expressed early on that I needed real numbers. An exact amount would be the best case scenario, if that wasn't possible, I would rather be told a high amount, then paying a lower amount at the end, then receive a low amount and have to pay more at the end.
R.G.'s worse case scenario is looking around $325, and possibly having a lot of doo~doo water all over my parent's floors! That will not be a good thing!

R.G. took a few minutes to try and figure something better for my parents. He found what he needed on the roof of the apartment building, he's going to try the main clean out, all he needed from us is electricity.

R.G. was up doing his business in no time flat, unfortunately it was not successful right away. He kept grinding at it, I was hot just standing on the grass watching him, he must have been smoking up on that roof, with the sun beating down on him! He never showed it though, half an hour later, both showers were fully functioning again, and the toilet is as good as it has been in the 5, almost 6 years that I have known about it and seen it work! All Wins!

It got even better though, the specials that are offered, are really real specials! $79, that was it! Some of you that are more experienced and skilled at these sort of things, might not think that is all that great. For a person with my skill set and experience, it couldn't have gotten any better then what I received today! Our Senior Technician, R.G., easily could have taken me for a ride for $150, $200, possibly even the $325 that he gave me when I wanted that high side estimate! I watched him the whole time, the man was working, like for reals working!

Honesty and Integrity! If you are running into people that have these qualities all the time, you are truly blessed! I do not run into these types of business practices all the time, I wish I did! More often then not, I have experienced the opposite of Honesty and Integrity!

On the Real, call these folks if you really need help, they'll hook you up proper! Thank You, R.G.!!!< /review><time>1614376622098< /time></record>

I would definitely use this company again.  I called for clogged sink.  Upon inspection it turns out it was a simple repositioning of a dishwasher hose.  I really appreciate Lawrence honestly and not trying to offer me services I didn’t need.  I will definitely be recommending this company to family and friends.</Review>

< review>
These guys came out to clear a clogged drain. Spent hours trying to figure out what was causing the clog. They said we had broken pipes.

They left a port open in my garage while running water flooding my garage. They didn't even offer to help clean up. I called out another company for a second opinion and they cleared clogged drain in minutes, and showed me video of clear pipes.

Do not trust these guys!!<//review>

<Review>This company is 5 star all the way. The service and customer service were outstanding... but the best part about these guys, is the actual care. They came to service my bathroom sink during this "much needed times". They were quick to respond and quoted everything up front.
Mr. Rob Sandoval was extremely informative, and placed high priority over our bathroom use.. again during this "much needed time".. the Division Manager Pete Padilla also came to ensure everything was done to get us back up and running.
This company did not "stack" pricing on me or charge me by the hour. Very professional and Very Honest!
During these "much needed times" where households need plumbing, water, gas and electricity.. Elite Rooter is the plumbing company you want to lean on for support!

Thank you Pete, Rob and the entire Elite Team!

Stay safe out there!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Juan and Brian came out and not only We’re they professional but they quickly identified the issue and provided options to resolve the situation. They were more concerned about solving the problem than trying to make money off me. They helped me look at some options that kept the resolution’s costs down. They also gave me some tips that could help me down the road in the future. Thank you Elite Rooter, Juan and Brian earned my trust with your company.< /text>

<Text>Julio was very polite and respectful of my property. He unclogged the drain and cleaned up.  I would take issue with the advertised price of $69 to unclog a drain. It had to be rootered, which is the name of the company so that  implies the drain will be rootered, and it cost and additional $56 because it wasn't "just" a Ptrap rooter. This seems misleading.<//Text>< pictures>

I was so thrilled when Jesus arrived on time, as time is always of the essence.
He was awesome.
He cleared the clog off our kitchen and the charge was as explained online and before he started.
I recommend him for sure.
He was very nice, knew what he was doing and very pleasant to work with.

Thank you Jesus!< /Review>

Robert S came out to unclog our drain today. Very professional and polite and respectful, 3 qualities missing from most businesses. Very impressed with Robert he did a fantastic job and if I could give him 10 stars I would. Recommend the company for having such good employee and Robert S in particular, one in a million.

I yelped for a quote and Elite Rooter immediately responded and set up an appt for the next morning.

<review>Having needed plumbing replaced under our home throughout, Rafael and his team were excellent. He was thorough, explained everything wrong and what needed to be replaced and took lots of photos to show me. He also took photos afterwards so I could see what they did under my house. They cleaned up completely after each day’s work and took proper Covid safety measures at this time. We will definitely be your lifetime customers.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Jesus C. was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was extremely communicative and made sure to get the job done the proper way. He was extremely clean and tidy and after his work was completed he made sure that I was pleased with his work before he left. Overall, a wonderful experience.<//review>

Arnold came over within a day to snake out the clean out in the backyard. He was very professional and offered advice going forward. Despite not being able
to fix the issue, he did not charge me for his time, and provided options for future work.</text>

<Review>I had two other plumbers come to my house to fix a plumbing issue. They both gave me quotes that I didn’t feel quite comfortable with. I thought it was way too much for the work I needed done. Michael Lanphier from elite router came out and I felt that he was honest he gave me a good price. He gave me different options of different ways I could fix the problem and explained what was involved. I was extremely happy with the work he did. I would recommend elite rooter. He was very professional and completed the work promptly and I feel the problem was fixed right for the right price.<//Review>< Resp>

Jesus and then Pete were courteous and professional. They came for a slow draining kitchen sink, and then we went ahead and did the hydrojet as there was years of grease build up. I'd recommend the company!<//Review>

I called Elite Rooter after another plumbing company gave me a ridiculous bid to fix my main sewer line. I called at 9am and they had a technician (Michael Lanphear) out by 10:30am that same morning!  I can’t speak any higher of the Michael. He was quick, efficient and really explained the whole process to me. He came, he cabled and he cleared my sewer line. Will be using these guys again!< /text>

<review>I called for a service a couple days ago and an employee named Michael Lanphear came to my home. I called Elite Rooter on a whim and having been frustrated with previous services from another company, I was reluctant to have someone in my home that I did not know. But Michael was a very pleasant person who displayed a high level of professionalism. After some browsing I found that I was quoted a very fair price and I am more than happy with the service I received.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

I’d give them a minus 5 if I knew how.
Did not have the best experience with Elite Rooters as I discovered after agreeing to this company’s price that it was twice what other plumbing companies charged for the same repiping job.  Buyer Beware! As senior citizens  it was hard lesson for us.

They did not preform the work but hired another plumbing contractor to complete the contract. That company contracted with another plumber who completed the job.
Found out from another plumber that no permits were obtained, no insulation was installed, and pipes not installed behind the drywall but placed in front of the drywall. Another $600 to repair their mistakes.<//text>

First time calling Elite Rooter.  Brian showed up on time and was very courteous.  He listened to my issue and checked the problem.  The problem had resolved prior to his arrival.  Brian was honest and educated me on what happened.

I would definitely use them in the future and totally recommend Elite Rooter!

<Review>I was having a backed up kitchen drain.  Michael lanphear came out and after multiple attempts at snaking my drain. He informed me that the entire drain was completely destroyed and it had to be replaced. Thank the lord I had michael out that day because if it wasnt for him I would have never known.  13000$ later water was flowing and so were the positive vibes thank you thank you thank you elite rooter for the great service.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dcd79eabf0bc35:0x3088c5ad91b1aea6<//gmap_id>< pics>

<review>Soro the rooter was very resposible when he learned that there was a leak coming down from the upstair bathroom. He came back right away in the evening and pumped out the water to prevent any more leaking. He and his supervisor returned in the morning using the video camera to resolve the clogging in my sewer.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1584034603920, 'text': 'Hilda, thank you for the great review of Soro!

<text>Have stopped here many times on my way east to Temecula. Very rude attendants (Young kid cashier with an attitude in the evening "You're gonna have to give a bill smaller than $100 dude"), no hot coffee. A good place to stop along the way but I think I will find another one!<//text>< pictures>

I have been here dozens of times.  The location has a drive-through car wash.  The gas prices are kind of high. I've always found the cashiers to be friendly. It's a very small store so there isn't a huge selection of items. But they do sell the ascensions like motor oil and of course some sodas and some snacks and some candies and chips.< /Review>

<text>This gas station is bunch of crooks. They promote cash price and fuel rewards and when it comes to pay they will charge you full price. Cash price they offer is 3.95 my fuel rewards was 0.07 so my price per gallon should be 3.87 but I was charged 4.05. complained with cashier he did not seem to be interested to resolve it.< /text><name>Peter Bobro< /name>< Pictures>

Would give it zero stars if possible. Car Wash rollers severely scratched my car on both sides from front to back. Employee rude and told me i can make a claim but they will not pay. I wouldn't go to this car wash under any circumstances! Don't give them your business.< /Review>

love the great quality gas. Having my son work at a repair shop, he knows that it is far worth it to use the better gas, it keeps you from having to have expensive repairs.<//Review>

Bad customer service... cashier didn't even know the price of the gas I paid for and had to walk outside to a pump when I asked how much it cost for regular. End up charging me credit/debt price instead of cash price when I paid with cash...so annoyed with them. I will be returning for the difference very soon<//text>

Covid restriction update: as of Mar 7,2021, there are dining tables in the Great Mall about 25% capacity. Blacken fish is good.

Fast, friendly and good food. I've been comming here since the Greatmall first open. Seems they changed ownership maybe twice. Was bad a few times but now seem good again. Blacken fish was nice n spicy.< /Text>

We bought a two entree and a side combo from this restaurant at the Great Mall food court. The two entrees we selected were orange chicken and pepper steak with side of fried rice. The fried rice was good and had the high taste of soya sauce. The steak was well cooked but had more broccoli than meat. My favorite was the orange chicken, which had the slight sweetness that gave a nice taste.< /Review>

<review>Food is really greasy and unhealthy. I tried a sample of the orange chicken and while it tasted good it quickly messed up my stomach a few hours later. I'm still in pain a day later, I don't recommend this place.</review>< pictures>

<review>This place seemed to be alright and I wanted to try something new. The ladies seemed friendly, the sample tasted amazing, and I was hungry for some tasty food. So I ordered noodles, Cajun chicken, and burbon chicken with a Sprite. After eating about 2/3 the meal I felt kinda weird. I finished my meal and sucked down some water. Then it hit me... I ran to the bathroom and said hello to my dinner. There was something wrong with the food. I told the manager what happened and her response was "sorry everything very fresh". That doesn't mean something wasn't wrong with the food. She didn't offer me my money back, simply said her response once more and continued cleaning. Never going back there and warning everybody to never eat there.< /review>< pictures>

Noodles soggy, spicey potatoes dried up, burbon chicken ok, diet coke tasted like they just cleaned the machine with chemicals....    and the associate looked like she was mad that she was working there.   Waste of money.</text>

They definitely have a deal you can't refuse. Once you accept the plan that best fits your needs.You will go through the paperwork but They make it pretty quick and easy as they walk you through it. So you'll be  In and out and on your way in no time. The name says it all "Acceptance" for everyone.</review>

< Review>
This office is TOP NOTCH, I Came in and got some set up by Jennifer on my newly purchased car and she gave me different options with coverage and found me the best plan to get set up with on my budget and based on my needs and even helped me get all the paperwork together for my financing company .After getting my first bill, I came in and was able to pay at the office and was helped by Brittany,  her customer service was on point as well. Quick precise and friendly and I can tell she really knew her stuff, might coming back to get some renters insurance as well since they cover that also, the customer service I got from these two was excellent I’ll be going there for all my insurance needs and highly recommend to my friends and family.< /Review>

Edward Lou Montgomery. I had my first auto insurance policy with him in 2007, I am very at ease and relaxed because of his proficiency. He left for awhile but when he came back I am very happy because I know I am in good hands. I have never seen such an insurance agent who knows all the ins and outs, he is well-rounded and very professional. Thank you and welcome back, sir.</text>

<review>I just wanted to write you a quick review to thank Acceptance Insurance and its’ Staff for their honesty and dedication while signing up for insurance.  I have always been wary of any type of insurance company, often with good reasons, but Acceptance Insurance has helped to redefine the stereotype.

Thank you so much Acceptance Insurance for answering all of my questions honestly, and making the process not as painful as it otherwise could have been.  I am happy with the results so far, not freaking out about any type of fee or hidden ones, and am completely satisfied.  This is a pretty ideal situation when it comes to obtaining insurance, and it's all thanks to Acceptance Insurance & its’ Staff.

You can be sure that if I have any friends looking for Car Insurance in the future, I will be sending them to:

Acceptance, tell them to ask for Lou, Jennifer & or its’ Staff!

Thanks again!

Yours truly,

Norene French

<Text>Ms. Keona was so helpful! I had been searching around comparing insurance quotes for a little while & decided to check this place out. From the very beginning to end of this experience I felt like all of my questions were answered in detail. Keona didn't rush me at all. I received a quote, it wasn't exactly what I expected so I decided to go with another company, however I just wanted to let people know this young ladies customer service was excellent!<//Text>< Pictures>

I have been dealing with Jennifer for over 7 years about my car insurance she is a best  She treats everyone like their family and makes you feel at home we are conducting business she gives you all your best options and let you make the better choice

I have tried to do with other people when she was not in office and they give me half assed answers so I don't deal with anybody else but her< /review>

< Review>
I was searching for some car insurance places in vallejo and came across acceptance so i said what the heck ill try this place because of all the positive reviews i seen.I was helped by a nice lady named keona who was very helpful and polite and friendly.she helped me find insurance that i am able to afford and help me save money. So im giving this review 5 stars because of her great positive attitude and her great customer service. Thank you again and i will be refering friends and family.</Review>

Enterprise Rent-A-Car in San Clemente was a great experience for me. They were genuinely kind and courteous which can be rare in these trying times. They also showed pride in their positions and made the most of their customer service opportunities. I think most people are very loyal to great customer service and I am no exception. You have my loyalty and look forward to my next Enterprise experience. Thanks to Enterprise San Clemente for making me feel appreciated!

Did not take personal bank cards or cash. Only credit cards but didnt inform us until after pickup. Wanted another $200 hold on the card. Wouldnt go throo because the hotel already had a hold. He offered us a ride back and then went inside for about 20 minutes leaving us outside without saying anything! We ebded up Ubering.< /Review>

<Text>I have 2 thoughts to share regarding my recent Enterprise rental. One positive, one negative.
On day-2 of my 1100 mile drive home, with a Nissan 'Armada' as my rental (did not request this type car, it was the only SUV available at my originating rental station), at my first refueling stop on an interstate in Western U.S, got two "maintenance alerts" on my instrument display. One involved the "oil system", and the other said to "perform maintenance on tires." Did not specify which tire. In case these alerts were triggered by the car's "scheduled maintenance" program, I accessed the car's scheduled maintenance program, and increased the time interval between "oil change" and "tire rotation", in hopes this would erase the "alerts." Had no effect. At a service station, I had the tires checked by a mechanic, and 1 1/2 quarts of oil added (all it would take to fill). Still, the alerts would not erase. Made the decision to get rid of this car at the next Enterprise rental location along my route.
Now, for the 'positive' feedback: the manager on duty at the St. George, UT airport could not have been more helpful in getting me on my way, in a very reasonable amount of time, in a replacement SUV. She also included a free "tank of gas" for my trouble. My appreciation and thanks to the St. George, UT Enterprise station manager who patiently listened to my "maintenance woes", and found a car for me to continue my journey, and all this I might add, with NO notice. I just "showed up" at her counter in the airport, and she took it from there. Enterprise has great employees. Thank you.< /Text>< userid>

<text>You guys saved me a ton of money. When I 1st got to California I had to rent from hertz. The car smelled of smoke and had an empty beer bottle in it. My trip was booked the same day I left and u guys did not have any cars available.  The hertz car was so expensive.  Like 3 time more.  Not to mention your staff was so much more friendlier than Hertz.  Thanks again for being amazing.<//text></record>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Unfortunately, this experience was not up to par. Although the reservation had been made on line previously, the car was not ready. The facility apparently does not have washing capability, so the car had not been washed. Nor had the interior been cleaned. As a result the attendant had to begin the vacuuming process after I checked in, resulting in a delay. Other than vacuuming, I am not aware of any other sanitizing process that was done.

<text>Amir and Kathryn gave me excellent customer service today. I have dealt with Kathryn before and every time I am very happy with the service I received from Enterprise! They really seem to have their heads screwed on right over there with their priority being customer satisfaction over pumping us for every penny that we are worth. As a consequence they are the first people I think of when in need of a rental car. Thanks again Kathryn!🖖😀👍<//text></record></dataset><record>

Although we live in San Clemente, this was our first time renting a car from this branch and what a great experience it was. I hope corporate notices that Nehan is a great asset to their operation, she is so friendly and effective that if we still had our business I would try to hire her away from Enterprise. So much her as Darrell make you feel so comfortable doing business with them.

Had to use this company while my truck was in a body shop. They came and picked me up and also talk to my insurance to get me into a truck instead of a car which was appreciated since I ended up needing a truck that weekend. They also were able to help me out when I wasn’t able to return the rental on the return date which made things a lot easier with everything going on. I would definitely go back to them if I ever have to rent a vehicle again.<//text>

The employees are friendly and my Toyota Camry was a very nice car. As I turned the car in, it turns out they owe me money. Getting this money back, in the past, requires a few phone calls. Hopefully this will be easier and faster this time.< /Text>

Excellent staff!  Connor, Dylan and Jillian were fantastic. Deal with them if you want a pleasant experience.
It is just unfortunate that they shuffle employees around from one location to another.  I have been using them for numerous times in the last 4 or 5 years and never had any frustrating experience with them.
I will see them again before the year ends.<//text>

<Text>My experience at San Clemente's Enterprise was great! I called an hour before my scheduled pick-up time to request them to pick me up at the house I was staying at for vacation. They sent an employee to pick me and my bf up at the time they gave. We had to get a bigger vehicle because the one we requested was just returned and needed to be cleaned. We were charged the price for the original car we booked. The ynder 25 fee is great too, just $10 compared to what I paid at another car rental place which was over double that. We returned the car the next day and Enterprise dropped us back off at the house. It was my first time renting at Enterprise and my best car rental experience I've had so far. Enterprise on El Camino Real in San Clemente is awesome!< /Text>< date>

I only needed a car for one to two days, and did not want to bother with the nearest airport's rentals. The San Clemente Enterprise office had a good assortment of cars, and a very competitive price. The car was ready when I arrived, and the staff were especially helpful in terms of letting me know the return time cutoff, and in not playing the "full tank" games I've often faced.
I was in and out of the office quickly, both when picking up and when dropping off, and there were no problems whatsoever.</Review>

<text>After having a terrible experience at another rental car place at the airport, we decided to cancel our reservation and went to Enterprise near our vacation location in San Clemente.   Since we didn't have a car they picked us up at our rental and brought us in to rent our car. From the moment we walked in the feeling was different.  Everybody that was working there was so professional and nice.  We were there about 5 minutes before we were out the door in our vehicle.  I don't know why it isn't this easy every where else. They totally took away our stress.  I will never rent a car anywhere else.<//text><name>DeAnna witham</name>< user_id>

<date>1466698883328< /date><review>The day of my rental pick-up I called to confirm they were picking me up. At that time I was informed the minivan I reserved was not available.

They wanted to switch me to another car but I asked if they could call the next closest Enterprise to see if a minivan was available there. One was.

My other issue is with the front window. This is the second time in a row the front window was not clean inside and out. There was a heavy film on the inside of the front window and it took me a while to clean it.

On a good note, the minivan drove great and the family was happy.</review><user_name>Michael Reissmueller< /user_name>< rate>

Got a call from them a couple days prior to reservation date and confirmed vehicle and pick up time.

Went to pick it up at said date and time,  no truck available there or any other local store.

They were nice about it and honestly it wasn't that big a deal to me but really kind of defeats the purpose of making a reservation and confirming it again prior to picking it up.

They offered me other non pick up vehicles but that's not what i requested.  I may have opted for something else at $0.00

Just a heads up,  if you require a truck, you probably want to have a back up plan.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1526579465627, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Rob S.

Got a fusion titanium to drive to Vegas and car was nice but there was an issue with the wheel. Traded it in in Vegas and got an impala and that one ended up having 9% oil and I hand to drive back to Orange County. The manager at the San Clemente office generously gave me some money back. I walked away smiling with the customer service. The only reason it's not 5 is for needing 3 cars. Manager in Vegas got us another fusion for the final trade and the hybrid made it back on one tank of gas.<//review>

<text>While traveling the last 7 weeks I rented several cars from Enterprise. I found their website to be easy to use and downloaded their app as well which was a great tool for me. Their pricing was always competitive, every car I rented was clean and running smoothly, the staff was always efficient and wanted to ensure my needs had been met and loved having the option to get a ride back to my place after dropping my vehicle back to them. Several times I returned my car earlier than I had originally planned and they always credited me for the houra without me having to ask andnwitjoit hassle. All around great experience working with the Enterprise of San Clemente, CA.<//text>< Pictures>

We needed a rental car to drive our family to Northern Cal to visit relatives for the Holiday's. We had asked for a 7 passenger, but turned out we only needed a 5 passenger. They had called to tell us they had other cars and that they could put us into a Range Rover for the same price. That was great! When we got there the associate that helped us was John. He was very professional and sincere. When we were inspecting the car we were going to rent my husband noticed a Ford Truck on the lot and made a comment about it... well long story short we drove off in the truck that only had 400 miles on it and my husband was grinning from ear to ear. (He used to drive a truck but now drives a Prius) Needless to say he was one happy customer. The entire process of rental and return went as smooth as could be and again, John was a great help and kept saying that he wanted us to be happy. We definitely were!</Text>

My experience was also not very good. There is a whole new crew in there and they have yet to learn how to promote the corporate name as well as their local service center. I have been renting cars from this San Clemente site for several years, primarily for a three day weekend so that my wife has a car at home while I go racing. On this last occasion, the car I received was dirty (covered in dust) and had a very serious jerking motion when the accelerator pedal was even slightly depressed. The car sat in our driveway all weekend just in case my wife needed to go out; she did not. When I returned the car, they stated that there was a ding in the passenger's side rear door. I told them to check the mileage on the car and compare to how far it was to my home and that the car sat in the driveway all weekend and was never parked in a public area. After some commotion and pointing out to them that the car was just as dirty as when I picked it up and that the ding was already there and that it was missed because of the dirt, they relented but not before the annoyance had been established. No apology, no upgrade, no invitation to try a different car in the future, etc. I reminded them that they are not the only game in town and they didn't seem to be too concerned. Corporate employee mentality. I will go somewhere else from now on. Did I need to specifically mention Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty, etc.?< /Text>

Very good customer service and nice guys but but I wish I would have been warned about the extremely poor mileage of the Jeep Cavalier. I was going back and forth to work 40 miles for 3 days. Each day I put $20 of gas in. I thought it had a leak or somebody was stealing my gas! Don't take the Cavalier!<//review>

I rent from this team in San Clemente regularly and have for the past 3-4 years. Great people, prompt flexible service, good car selection, at a good value from Enterprise. If you need a car locally or even don't want to hassle with airport pick ups....check these folks out.</Text>

Helpful staff and consistent service. I didn’t notice all the sand on the seats and the trunk on my last rental until I drove out of the parking garage. I called them and they made it right by swapping out the car and taking a day off my rental fee.< /review>

This plant has been here for decades. Blame IRVINE for zoning RESIDENTIAL property next to the plant. As someone who used to dispatch for yellow cab, I know that there used to be no housing north of Irvine Blvd, but now they have houses almost built next to the plant. You can't get upset at a plant that has a right to be here. Sue the realtors, sue the land developers, but more of all SUE IRVINE.</text>

Been working out of that plant for over 20 years, Irvine sure has changed. By the way No Trespassing, it's a private road and not a safe place to go for a bike ride or walk.<//Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><rating>4< /rating><Text>why did they approve a residential development within a mile from an asphalt company and why did you homeowners buy there?  Buyer beware.
The problem here is that CEQA covers the impact of a project on surrounding properties and not vice versa.  If they did look at the surrounding polluters the air studies in the EIR at the time probably showed no exceedances of any applicable standard.  The problem with odors is that often times the contaminants of concern are relatively low despite the intensity of the odor.  Asphalt is a complex mixture of compounds so good look with the testing.  But perhaps the project was going to get approved no matter what.</Text>< Resp>

<Time>1601680004320</Time><rate>1</rate><text>This TOXIC factory should have been closed down years back when the City of Irvine knew and approved plans for the Irvine Company to build homes and schools next to and surrounding this factory!  Irvine resident's air = toxic as a result of this plant!   In the 21st century, we envision a world in which our food, water and air are clean, and our children grow up healthy and thrive. Everyone needs a protected, safe community and workplace, and natural environment to enjoy. Sadly this is NOT possible with this factory in a residential neighborhood! Asphalt Fumes are Known Toxins. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states “Asphalt processing and asphalt roofing manufacturing facilities are major sources of hazardous air pollutants such as formaldehyde, hexane, phenol, polycyclic organic matter, and toluene. Exposure to these air toxics may cause cancer, central nervous system problems, liver damage, respiratory problems and skin irritation.” [EPA]. According to one health agency, asphalt fumes contain substances known to cause cancer, can cause coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath, severe irritation of the skin, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. [NJDHSS] Animal studies show PAHs affect reproduction, cause birth defects and are harmful to the immune system. [NJDHSS] The US Department of Health and Human Services has determined that PAHs may be carcinogenic to humans. [DHHS]
 Health Impacts & Loss of Property Value. The Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League (BREDL), a regional environmental organization, has done two studies on the adverse impacts on property values and health for residents living near asphalt plants. A property value study documented losses of up to 56% because of the presence of a nearby asphalt plant. In another study, nearly half of the residents reported negative impacts on their health from a new asphalt plant. The door-to-door health survey found 45% of residents living within a half mile of the plant reported a deterioration of their health< /text>< Pics>

The all American asphalt perfect illustration of what it is working hard. In addition to normal production during the day, emissions are also required at night. Perhaps they feel that their neighbors are tired of the good air, so they emit a disgusting odor from 11 pm-5 am. They use this scent to remind neighbors do not drift off into too deeply asleep. Because you have to work tomorrow.</text>

This is not right for a manufacture to be in local neighborhoods and emit chemicals for the children and families. City of Irvine charges high property tax and in return we are breathing in chemicals that cause cancer.</review>

All American asphalt plant emits terrible chemical smell pollution at night, from 8pm-5am. We owned a property in Stonegate just moved back here.. I noticed the smell at night, chemical burning smell, and thought it was my neighbor natural gas leaking or something like that. Then I found out about this asphalt plant, and realized it was their pollution!! They need to move away from the households, take responsibility for our health!! This chemical plant could increase the chance of people getting cancer in nearby residential area!</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>This factory needs to be moved from here. Causing air and noise pollution to the adjoining communities all the time. Their trucks run 24/7 on the residential streets causing immense rumbling, shaking and adding carcinogenic pollution and odor to the otherwise peaceful and quiet neighborhood communities. I am surprised how are they still running when the Irvine company have build so many residences in the area and truck traffic is never allowed to operate in the residential neighborhood let alone running 24/7 including middle of nights as well.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I would like to let you know that our sprinkler system was damaged as part of the construction being done on the sidewalk in front of our home....Your Bobcat came up onto the the grass median and crushed the pipes underground when it was jack hammering the old slab.....It has rendered our sprinkler line inoperable and causing erosion of the soil underground....I would ask that it be repaired.</text>

< Review>
I came here to get some flowers for my mom's birthday. My mom is obsessed with carnations, so I opted to make the custom bouquet.  It came out so beautiful, I was absolutely blown away. They smell absolutely beautiful and 11 days later they look exactly the same. This will be the only flower shop I go to from now on!<//Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Of all the flower shops we worked with, the most beautiful and spectacular flower design was presented by this flower shop. This flower shop also provides new, inexpensive bouquets of good quality to choose from, and it is easy to operate on its web. I will reorder it again and recommend it to my friends and relatives in the flower shop.

<Review>3 years in a row could not get a corsage for my wife for mother's day.  Maybe they do a great job but I wouldn't know because they are always booked its Wednesday Mothers day is Saturday.  Maybe I should have called sooner but I usually get it on the Friday before at any other flower shop.  Just tried one last time because it is right on the way home right off the freeway.  Bad business to turn down business but all in all like I said they  could be a fenamanl flower shop I just wouldn't know it.< /Review>< pics>

Just stepped out of this beautiful flower shop. Sam was extremely friendly and welcoming as well as the whole family. I can't believe I found such an amazing flower shop. The whole family was very attentive to my needs and got me the best price I've ever gotten on a beautiful arrangement. I can't wait til I have to come back to impress my lady with flowers again. Thank you very much, she absolutely loved it.</Text>

<Text>I love this place. They have given me a great deal on flowers each time. It's amazing how the place can look so small on the outside but it's filled with so many beautiful floral arrangements, plus the back semi-open space where they work. Parking is good and customer service has always exceeded my expectations.  They'll even email you a  receipt, so I'd say they're definitely doing there part to save the trees.< /Text>< Pics>

I just moved to Marlene's Flower Shop and I live just across the street from this flower shop. I went there for a valentine bouquet for my boyfriend and I was amazed by the shop, they have so many flowers to choose from. Very patient and friendly customer service. This is my my shop from now on and I really recommend it. (Reasonable pricing)!< /Review>

< Review>
Infinitely grateful for the family that runs this business!!! I went there to get a couple of flowers to do an arrangement on my own. I started asking for a few more things to help me with my decoration and they were very friendly and helped me get what I needed at a very cheap price.

HOWEVER THIS IS NOT IT! Two of the family members showed up a few hours later in my door delivering my wallet with important information and a good amount of cash in it. They didn't accept anything in retribution.

The actions of the two young people that came to my door reflect the ethics and values of their families and business.

May your business and ALL your workers be blessed for your honesty and well intended heart.<//Review>

Stopped in to buy lottery tickets at the machine by the door. From what I saw, it is a average liquor store and looked to be clean, on the inside and out.< /Review>

The store was very clean. It wasn't filled with tourist garbage. Prices were all clearly marked, which is nice. Others stores nearby will charge tourists double. The prices were all pretty fair too, especially with how close it is to the park.< /review>

1/1/2020- Per Eddie 'tell the truth about me' ok then Eddie should get off the phone once in awhile when his customer is standing there.  Employees are Great! Alcohol variety is large and some unique choices like Hazlitt Red Cat, 'de-lish!'.< /Text>

Perfect stop for some hotel room beer and Jameson. Grabbed some snacks for the kiddos while we were inside also. It was a really quick stop, just in and out, but found everything we wanted and decent prices!< /review>

Not only is this the nastiest liquor store I've ever seen, it is worse than the gas stations and has the worst prices of any liquor store. Not to mention the terrible staff, if I could give negative stars, I would. Don't get your drinks here!</review>

I live near by and accepting my visa/debit isnt allowed even though its mine and I had proof of id with it!! Old asian lady is stubborn and just trying to make you use the ATM to withdraw cash and only use cash in their store.

Its really unpleasant because she seemed nice at first but to tell me I can't use my card even though its a dollar to use ATM cards,,,, such a Rip and bad business... To be down the street from DISNEYLAND :?
GO TO DAY & NIGHT MARKET. they are friendly with a GREATER selection.
How is this place in business still, its 2017..,< /Text>

<review>Got there at 2:55pm just before they closed for the afternoon and they were kind of enough to still seat and serve us. Ordered shrimp & asparagus, chicken in garlic sauce, and house chow mein with gravy. Food was tasty. The only negative would be that some of the asparagus was too fibrous and should've been shaved down some, yet the food still tasted great. Were it not for the asparagus issue, I'd give them 5 stars.<//review><time>1554338829417<//time>< gmapID>

Probably about 40 items on the lunch special menu. W ordered house special fish filet, fry crispy tofu,  hot and sour fry whole fish, green been, and kung Pao chicken. The food is very good. Highly recommended.</Review>< pictures>

I came in for takeout and waiter took my order brought me out dry with no sauce half portion orange chicken. Are they trying to save money on portions!? I asked for sauce, they totally ignored me. They had to remake the entire dish again while I was waiting, WASTING MY TIME! Also the quality of this place has gone DOWN the drain. Trust me, I have eaten here for over a decade and this place quality of food and service is very bad now, NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE!< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Can be regarded as an old Cantonese restaurant. Affordable price. The dishes are also good.

I had the best experience at my first time at YogaCycle! Everyone was so nice and welcoming. I was nervous since I'm new to the area and pretty new to spin/TRX but the instructor, Lisa, couldn't have been nicer! She helped me set up my bike and told me to go my own pace. The classes are challenging but also fun. Everyone has a great attitude and it's an awesome environment to be in. I bought a membership immediately after my first class. John was there to welcome me, help me sign in, give me a tour of the gym and explain in detail the membership options. He even gave me a reference paper to help me buy spin shoes. I can go on forever about this place! I'm excited to continue to grow at this gym.< /text>

<text>I took my first spinning class in years here today, and I'm in love! The instructor was helpful and friendly and broke down all the moves so they were easily understood. The intensity was perfect. A great way to start the day!< /text>< name>

I loved YogaCycle!! I looked forward to TRX with Derek every week on Monday's and Thursday's. He's one of the best instructors I've ever had and he not only made the class fun, but genuinely cared about us doing the moves correctly and would also give us modifications to do if we weren't comfortable. Once he knew your name he wasn't afraid to call it out and push you to do your best! I also enjoyed the spin classes--especially the 5pm on Thursday's! The only reason I'm leaving is because I've accepted a job that's too far for me to make it to the classes here. All the staff were super friendly and the studio was always clean. I'm going to miss it!</Text>

The best value for spinning in the South Bay...brand new bikes, awesome music, rockin' instructors (each with a different style) and a great community!  Great way to start or end the day!<//Text>

Hugo pushes me to give it my all. The way he designs the TRX workout really fatigues my muscles in the best way.</text>

My husband and I started going here after purchasing a groupon late last year. The facility is small, but very clean and the people are great. We enjoyed our classes so much, we've become regulars. In fact, my husband recently started teaching a spin class at this studio, Monday evenings at 6pm (IG: jesse.spins). You should definitely check it out!<//text>

<Text>I started yogacycle when I was 6 months pregnant. I was able to exercise all the way until the end & able to restart 6 weeks post c-section because kind, personable and knowledgeable instructors always offer modifications in class. I love how I can rotate cardio (spinning), strength (TRX), and stretch/core (yoga) depending on how I feel. Yogacycle is a gem in South Bay and I am lucky to be a part of this gym!</Text><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Text>I’m here at this clinic right now and yes, parking is free and easy, clinic is very clean, the staff is great too however I think that a doctor should be able to evaluate your whole neck, shoulder, back and arm if you are coming in because of pain of shoulder and arm. The doctor or assistant was nice but she didn’t palpate any parts of the areas I needed her to. I had to ask her and when she did touch it was like a very light touch. She would come in and out of the office and would leave me there. The X-ray tech was very nice as well. What I didn’t like is that you have to pay for pieces of your body if you want X-ray. Like I wanted my neck shoulder back and arm xrayed but I had to pay 75 for each section to X-ray, way too much. I’m happy I had the X-ray of my shoulder/top of arm only BUT I’m disappointed with my initial doctor visit or assessment because there really wasn’t one. At least they were all nice and the visit was quick. I gave it two stars because of no assessment of my arm/shoulder and back problem. I will be back for smaller things not for sprains or strains.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Clean, organized, professional staff upon sign in.  Dr. Michelle was great.  I get very anxious going to the doctor and she made me feel safe and relaxed.  Didn't have to wait long and was happy to enjoy a tea while I waited.  This clinic is great. The scope of their services is amazing and I appreciate the 7 day window to return if necessary.  Thank you.</Review>

Best clinic HANDS DOWN! Amazing place...been coming here since Hannah was working there back in the days ( now she's in a different location ) but the doctors and the nurses are amazing! Affordable and very very friendly. I don't want to get sick or hurt by any means but I feel safe knowing I can always come here.</text>

< review>
I just left the clinic and the women at the reception were talking screaming when they were referring to me, they seemed rude, not friendly at all. What a patient would like to find in a clinic is a warm and friendly welcome not what I found, in addition to that it’s expensive and not clean! the bathroom in a pandemic moment was indecent !!!  I do not recommend for any reason that anyone use the services of this clinic. Bad service!</review>

I have been here multiple times and every time is always amazing. The receptionists are extremely friendly and kind and make you feel welcome! The doctors that work here truly do care about there like of work and are very passionate about it clearly! Dr Christine is one of the best doctors I’ve ever encountered. She makes me always feel at ease and is seriously so sweet! ❤️<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I hate going to the doctor because I always have a bad experience. It either takes forever, or I don’t feel the doctor cares enough to really find the root of the issue. I was nervous to go to this walk-in clinic because it’s in the middle of Hollywood but I’m SO glad that I did. I’ve by far had my best doctor experience at Hollywood walk -in clinic. They were fast! I booked an appointment but decided to walk-in a little earlier and they got me in right away. The doctor and nurses were SO sweet. Seriously I’ve never had such sweet medical staff! I can’t remember the name of the doctor but it was a lady. The clinic it’s self was super clean as well! There is also free parking. 11/10 recommend!< /text>< date>

Staff is super friendly and whenever I go I genuinely feel like I’m being heard and taken care of. Even with the rising Corona cases I’m sure they have their hands full and yet on my last visit, I felt like I was a priority which I bet isn’t easy to find. Great Clinic 👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼</text>

Weird fees, aggressive behaviors from one particular staff member, but other nice staff and diligent.not sure why I was charged a $99 consultation fee when the nurse just sat there acting like she was trying to empathize with the pain in my back lol. Probably won’t be coming back any time soon<//review>

Called because I was having some issues with my ear, they were super friendly and very nice. Told me to come in so they can further assist. Went in at 8am on Thursday  and was shocked the place was empty. I was expecting it to be super busy, I brought my book and a snack thinking this was going to be a 2-3 hour wait. Instead I got in right away they were able to let me know what was wrong and sent me on my way. Not to mention I don’t have insurance and the prices are so affordable. They do take insurance though. I also went back for a follow up, I got in right before they were going to close and they still saw me, I was again shocked with how little the wait times were and the whole process was so quick and easy. Everyone here is so friendly and nice. Especially the ladies at the front desk, I wish I would’ve gotten there names. Anyways I totally recommend this place, fast efficient and affordable. Go here you will not be disappointed. Also they have FREE PARKING!!! You can’t go wrong with this place.<//text>

I just had the perfect clinic visit experience. I needed a blood draw for a specific test. I called my usual clinic and was told that I would need to see the doctor to get an order for it. OK, there's $150 right there...and then the blood-draw fee. So, I went to Hollywood walk-in clinic for the first time ever. These people are amazing. No need to see the doctor, just specify which test I wanted.
The technician (Karla) is a genius. She inserted the blood draw syringe totally painlessly! The girl at the front desk was super-efficient, helpful and 100% professional.
And there were two more miracles. A 10-minute wait time...and the bill? $50.
I'm going there again. Thanks people.< /review>

Hollywood Walk-In Clinic COVID-19 ANTIGEN tests are not accepted by airlines for travel.

Despite knowing this, this clinic continues accepting fees and administering ANTIGEN tests for travel.

This should be illegal.</Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1610734881831, 'text': 'COVID-19 antigen tests are NOT generally accepted for international airline travel.  This is stated on our walk-up appointments page.  This patient presented for a walk-up,  outdoor, antigen swab-only appointment and mentioned that it was "for travel" during the swab.  We have many patients that get the antigen tests for their own purposes when they are traveling.  They will be on a plane, car or bus and do not want to expose anyone to COVID-19 if they have it.  They all mention that it is "for travel".\n\nIf you need a COVID test in order to board a plane and travel then this is a completely different story.  You will need a PCR test. Again, this is stated on our website on the same page where he made his appointment.  This was a simple walk-up, outdoor tent test with NO provider consult.  He was tested as he had requested and he left.  There was no discussion as to where he was traveling or exactly why he needed the test performed.  He requested a test and that test was performed.\n\nIf we sit down with you in the clinic and discuss the exact reasons for your testing then we are better able to guide your choices.  Guidelines are changing every day and they are difficult to keep up with.  In this case, there was no consult and we simply performed a test requested by a patient.'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>This place was fantastic!  I made an appointment online but got there about 30 minutes early and they kindly got me in early.  The doctor was very considerate, warm and professional.  The waiting room was clean and they even play great music. :)  A fabulous option for both insured and the uninsured (as I am currently)!  Would highly recommend.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I started a new job and did not qualify for insurance right away. Unfortunately I got really sick and wasn’t able to see a primary care provider. I did some research and came across this place. Thank goodness I did. The prices here are very affordable for those who do not have insurance. I booked an appointment right away, however they accept walk-ins. The staff was very friendly and I was in and out right away. I highly recommend this place to those in a similar situation such as myself. 5 stars!</review><UserId.>112134339918378618240< /UserId.><Name>Markus Daniel<//Name><date>1563653391439</date>< rating>

Approximately 7 minutes to check in, triage and get seen by the doctor. It was comical when the doctor then said "Sorry for the wait".The doctor took his time with me and answered all my questions. $89 for a visit which is the cheapest urgent-care price I found, AND you also get a free follow-up for the same issue within 7 days! When I came back it was equally fast and I had a different but equally wonderful doctor the second time as well. Also, they have a parking lot!< /review>< rating>

This place has gone way downhill.  I made an appointment for 4pm and arrived 30 minutes early.  I asked them twice if I'd be up soon as walk-in's and other folks went ahead of me.  Finally a 4:30 appointment came and was seen.   At this point I was frustrated and running late for work so I finally asked "why are all of these people going ahead of me?"  They then asked if I'd shown my ID, etc, etc.  And were like "oh, yeah, you're next" And I was.  I then received the most rushed check up ever.  Was told I have strep-throat and tossed out all in about a 5 minute period of time.  So basically I paid $100 bucks to wait around for an hour.  Deeply disappointing and my last trip to this Clinic.<//review>

<text>Very pleased with our experience at the Hollywood Walk-in-Clinic.  We were overseas visitors and needed urgent assessment after a fall.  I booked an appointment on line the previous evening and appointment confirmed first thing next morning.  We were at the clinic for two hours after having consultations and x-ray.  Friendly staff and felt at ease. Highly recommend if you find yourself needing urgent medical treatment at a reasonable cost.</text><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

Visiting from out of town and they had me in and out in way less than an hour. Very kind staff as well. Absolutely no hassles at all. Will definitely use again if needed when I’m back.< /review>

<Review>BIGGEST SCAM . I normally don’t do bad review, but you need to be warn. This place look legit and good place and you pay for it. I pay way too much for a test that could be free , the result was Inconclusive and told me to get an other test somewhere else , send me to an other address. I have to pay extra for the result of the lab. 245$ for a test that wasn’t accurate.
I thought I was sick and scared for my life and end up doing an other test somewhere else for free, and I was not sick.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><rating>1<//rating><Date>1572200975037< /Date><response>None</response>< user_name>

<Review>Erin was so great. And the "vampire" who drew my blood made a miracle happen....I did not feel a thing. That has never happened. Also, the labs were all up and available to me in the morning. So, mystery not solved yet, but I am not out hundreds of dollars and got the best, most respectful and thoughtful care. I've been here before and will definitely go back.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I was referred to visit this clinic by a friend who spoke highly of the service offered and location. After visiting, I definitely understand the confidence my friend has in this clinic. The waiting room and offices are very clean and organized, there is parking for the location, the  personnel was very friendly and helpful. It is my new go-to for my health care needs. Thank you!< /text>< username>

Hollywood Walk-In Clinic was a life saver for me, being that it was Memorial Day and all of my go-to clinics were closed. Of course, I had to pay out-of-pocket, but it was still cheaper than if I were to go to a physician's office or elsewhere. My provider, Lillian P.A., was super helpful, quick, and to the point. She got me in and out within 30 minutes; that's the kind of service I like.<//Review>

I was in and out for my appointment very quickly. All of the staff were very polite and friendly.

Unfortunately, my treatment was outside their scope and needed a specialist referral. The staff followed up with me to ensure I didn’t have any issues booking the referral. I will visit again for more common issues.< /Text>

<review>I needed to get a TB test and a Medical Exam to be cleared to work at LAUSD as a substitute teacher. I was in and out in less than an hour, and it cost me less than $100 with no insurance! Oh my goodness, what a godsend. This place is absolutely wonderful, through and through. The staff are friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the entire office is pleasant and upscale. Unbelievable.<//review>< gmapID>

I had an overall good experience at the Hollywood Walk In clinic. I made an appointment online for 3:30pm on a Sunday and arrived at about 3pm. There was free parking with the weekend Valet in the adjacent lot by the clinic. I checked in by filling out a new patient form, and then waited. At about 3:30pm I was called in for my vitals, and then sent back out to wait for the doctor. The nurse who took my vitals apologized for the wait, informing me that the clinic was busy with a higher than average volume of patients. No problem. I was seen by a doctor by about 4pm. The doctor, Enrique (he introduced himself by first name which I liked) was extremely kind and understanding. He was a good listener and very personable. The visit was quick, but not rushed. I felt like he understood my needs and concerns and didn't try to pin any one thing on me (I'm not the biggest proponent of western medicine and pharmaceuticals). I left with a doctor's note for work and two prescriptions, one for now, and one as a backup in case my symptoms didn't go away within 48 hours. Saved me a second trip! However, Enrique informed me I could come back for a courtesy follow up appointment within 7 days. I don't have health insurance so for the price, this visit was thorough and worth the money. There was also a selection of teas for patients waiting! Big plus :) The space was super clean.< /text>

<Review>I love Hollywood Walk-In. The facility is clean and well decorated. I have never been treated badly here. The front desk staff are always friendly. Usually you are seen within an hour on a walk-in. They do accept appointments which brings the wait time down. The exam rooms are clean and comfortable. All of the doctors are friendly. They really help you, and I feel like they care about me. They are not just trying to push you out for the next patient. Also there is a free follow up visit if you are still having issues which I have taken advantage of a few times. Skip the emergency room and go here instead, it is worth it!!

doctor was extremely helpful, as soon as she realized that I was a foreigner, she explained everything very slowly and clearly and answered my every question very patiently.  Center was chill and clean (maybe because I went there at evening) and price was okay.  Overall, I was very satisfied.<//review>

< Review>
When I needed to find a good urgent care clinic, I was taken by the great reviews of the Hollywood Walk-In Clinic. I decided to visit their clinic, and beforehand I was easily able to make a reservation online. I got there early, and they took me right on time. The doctor was well-informed, thoughtful, asked great questions, was thorough and incredibly helpful. They took X-rays, and the technician made me feel very much at ease and was efficient and professional. The doctor really made me feel heard and supported at a time where I was feeling very anxious and worried, and I feel I got the best type of care I could've received. I highly recommend them!</Review>

I cannot warn you enough about The Hollywood Walk-In Clinic. First off, the reason they have such high reviews is because you get an email whether or not you were satisfied with your experience. If you are not, you leave them private feedback. If you are, you leave a review. Hence, why they have so many positive reviews.
The only reason I gave this place 1 star is because the staff at the front desk is very friendly.
The doctor I saw seems to be completely unqualified. I went in with an obvious case of pneumonia and he insisted on X-Rays and wouldn't give me the medication I needed without them. He also gave me poor suggestions when it came to healing pneumonia. I went to a second doctor the next day I was so anxious about it. He confirmed my suspicions on getting faulty recommendations. I also had to bring my medical record from the clinic for the new doctor to see and saw that he had FALSELY written that I smoke a pack of cigarettes a day (I NEVER said that!!!) and also wrote that I was not experiencing night sweats and a fever, which were two of my chief complaints!
I am completely horrified that they would make a mistake like that. It seems like it's a bunch of people playing doctor. They are friendly, but seem extremely unqualified.</text>

I love that they're so upfront about the costs. I've been to other places before that have hidden fees or end up charging more than they initially say they will. Everything here is straight-forward and easy. Have gone a couple of times and always had a good experience.< /Review>

<Review>4.5 out of 5 stars. I appreciate the convenience of booking an appointment online, which made the process go a lot faster as a new patient. The staff were nice and efficient. I would definitely let future patients know that getting prescriptions filled without insurance is much cheaper at CVS than at Rite Aid.</Review>< Pictures>

I’ve never felt compelled to write a review for a medical clinic until today. This place was clean, efficient, and I feel completely taken care of. I went in as a cash patient, and it was cheaper than going to a place that accepted my insurance. The practitioner that took care of me was thorough, extremely kind, and got me out quickly without making me feel rushed. I’m not sure what more I could ask for. Good on them.</text>

I came to Hollywood walk in clinic after discovering a pretty bad throat infection.  I was feeling horrible and had my husband drive in. As a first time patient my check in was very easy,  the facility has its own parking, it's tiny but they have one along with street parking. I went right after they opened and was in and out within 30 minutes.  I was so so happy the staff was nice and professional and the doctor wasted no time in getting down to business.  I have found my  go to spot when in need of urgent care!<//Review>

This was my first time there. The staff was very professional and courteous. I went to get a checkup and some blood work but my doctor told me it wasn't necessary for the blood work so they didnt proceed. The doctor was very honest about everything he saved me some money. Great place to go to when you need a quick fix.< /Text>

<Text>I was in town visiting family and brought a lingering cold.  I walked in on a Saturday morning and they saw me within 20 minutes.  Very efficient, very friendly, respectful check in.  They checked my vitals and took my history and then I saw a very competent young doctor who communicated well and explained my options.  Check out was breeze - $89 flat and no hidden fees or gotchas.  One of the nicest medical service experiences I’ve had.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2bf3a4e9f65bd:0x6c7354ebde728bb</gmapID><user_id>104267133339100757897</user_id><Time>1532266015242</Time>< rate>

<text>Staff was exceedingly kind, helpful, and professional. Couldn't believe how nicely I was taken care of. My issue was probably pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, but the person who helped me out (Christina?) was so incredibly sensitive to how freaked out I was. I was recommended by my partner who was treated here before; he'd said everyone was really nice and helpful and he was right! Prices were doable and they listed out prices for all the services and supplies on the new patient paperwork, which I was very appreciative of. Would definitely recommend.</text>< Time>

<review>This place is amazing! I can not say enough good things about my experience. Derek and Angela were absolutely amazing, and made me feel so comfortable. I have a phobia of getting my blood drawn, and it usually is an eventful process, but Angela put me at ease making it the easiest blood work of my life. Highly recommend, especially if seeing the doctor is not your favorite.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This place is great. It's clean, and the doctors are knowledgeable and they LISTEN. That goes a long way. I've been here twice and I've been able to get x-rays and just a regular examination for a cold. I love that you don't have to have insurance and can still get treated and I also love that you can book appointments online or just walk-in. Great place!< /Review>

<Time>1368815316875<//Time><name>Julie Falen<//name><Review>I love this place.  I have been there a couple of times in the past and I have never had to wait in the waiting room more than 20 minutes, and the waiting room is clean and bright and quiet.  The staff is excellent, very friendly and also have a sharp appearance.
the wait was a lot longer once in the exam room - this was the only downside of this visit. However the exam was quick but fairly thorough.  I was given a prescription that they were able to fill on the spot for me too at much less cost than the pharmacy.  Great place. Highly recommend!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Was struggling real hard trying to get a physical appointment that I really needed so I could begin my new job until I called this clinic to see what their availability was and told me I could come in whenever I want. I came in that same day and they directly attended me. Felt like I was in and out of that place within a short time. People were lovely and more than helpful. The prices are great and the clinic itself is great. Definitely would recommend!<//Text><rating>5</rating><response>None< /response>< time>

They are so organized and efficient! Completely different from most Walk-In Clinics in the greater Los Angeles area where waiting 45 minutes to an hour is standard. You know exactly what you’re paying. Everyone is very friendly and professional. Plus you’re usually in and out in half an hour. Highly recommended.<//review>

Awesome. I went there three times last year while uninsured for a fall, eye infection and dizziness. They are upfront about cost, good follow up, very professional and friendly staff and doctors are knowledgeable. They do a great job of making a patient feel comfortable and secure. Highly recommend. I’ll come again for an urgent issues - very pleased. Thank you!<//Review>

I was pretty impressed from an urgent care coming from the CA area. The downside was I was a walk in and had to wait about an hour and 40 minutes but the upside was everyone was very professional and efficient with my care. I'd recommend this urgent care to anyone.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The Hollywood Walk-In Clinic was very easy to check in with, the staff, specifically the doctor, was professional and kind.

Unfortunately, they don't take Medi-cal or Medicare, so that was a bit of a bummer paying out of pocket. Though, their prices are fairly reasonable, so it wasn't too much of a fret. Overall, Walk-In In clinic in Hollywood is reasonable and you can expect quality care here.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This facility was wonderful. The site was clean and the staff was fast and very friendly! I don't have insurance for the remainder of the year, so I am a cash patient. The prices (which are listed as you walk in) are very reasonable. They also provide a free follow up visit within 7 days. God willing, I don't have any more issues for the remainder of this year, but if I do, I will be sure to return to this facility!</text>

Proceeded to room and Michaela Fajardo was there very quickly.  Amazing service and answered all my questions.  Highly recommend clinic and her service.</Text>

<text>I’ve never experienced such a painless healthcare visit. At a WALK-IN, no less. I was in and out in 36 minutes. Making an appointment definitely helped, but there was excellent availability for the day, so it didn’t push me back much. The people are pleasant, knowledgeable, and efficient. I almost want something else to be wrong so I can go back!< /text>< Rate>

went in with some wrist and elbow pain. only waited about ten minutes! i wasn't sure about going in, because i initially didn't want to spend money and hoped it would heal on its own. but i saw enrique who really reassured me after testing to see if any bones were broken (which they weren't!) and he gave me peace of mind. it was definitely worth the $89 fee to not have to worry anymore, to get answers to my questions about the braces i had been wearing and he also showed me some helpful exercises i could do. would recommend to friends and definitely coming back here again.< /Review>

My experience at this clinic was great, I was unsure since I was going off existing reviews but my experience was excellent, it was quick(paperwork was also minimal), nurse and doctor were straight forward and the price list was easy to understand!<//review>

The ability to book an appointment on-line and pre-enter Insurance information made for an easier check-in process.  There was no wait when I arrived.  The entire staff was professional, helpful, courteous and listened to the needs of my visit.  I'll go again!</Text>

I'm amazed at how compassionate this place was.  I only talked to them for 10 seconds to use their restroom and the woman in front let me back without hesitation or question.  Most other places really don't want to let you use their restroom, but this place didn't even question it.  She pointed me in with a smile.  I am truly  grateful.
As a medical professional it is amazing to see places like this care for you as a person and not a number. Even though I didn't get seen by a nurse or doctor, I can tell already that this place offers top notch care through compassion.<//text>

This being an urban urgent care clinic, I braced myself for long wait times and crowded waiting rooms. But neither were true! Filling out my patient information, getting called to a room, submitting my test sample, talking to a PA and getting my prescription all took about 30 min. They also take a lot of insurances. Very smooth process with Hollywood Walk-In Clinic.</Text>

I was able to make an appointment and only waited a few minutes, but they still apologized for the delay. Both practitioners were good listeners who cared a lot more about my history than my regular doctors, and I was soon on my way with a prescription for the antibiotics I needed. The clinic is clean and pleasant. The only downside was that they didn't accept my insurance--Blue Shield Individual PPO.</review>

No long waits especially with the reservation system. It works!
The attendants were friendly and courteous.
I was seen by someone who's very knowledgeable and comforting. Was out of there with a prescription in a matter of 30 mins.
And was offered a 7 day free follow up if my condition doesn't get better.
Great first visit here overall.< /Review>

<Text>Everyone's always really nice there. If you're unable to make an appointment then there is usually a waiting time but that is to be expected from a walk-in clinic. Doctors that are carrying everybody's professional and it's a good place to go if you don't have insurance and need either care or some sort of medical service. Unfortunately I've had to go there multiple times due to not being able to afford insurance and it is one of the only places I feel comfortable going to.< /Text>< GmapID>

I love this place! $89 for a visit. It's clean and everyone is very nice and professional. Most prices are all displayed on their site so everything ia pretty straightforward and you know what to exoect. It's great if you don't have insurance, but they also do take insurance. I've been coming to Hollywood Walk-In clinic for years. I don't live in the neighborhood anymore, but when I got the flu and an ear infection recently I drove 30 minutes there instead of going to the places in my area (even though the urgent care in my area is cheaper!). It's worth the drive since I know ill be taken care of there. Also, I love how they made it so you can make appointments online now!</text>

I would definitely recommend this place! And they have a parking lot (though small) and street parking outside< /review>< Pics>

Walked-in as a first time patient. I was expecting a huge wait but they were very efficient and thorough. They are very transparent and affordable which is important if you lack health insurance. Thank you.</Text>

<review>I have been coming here to a couple years and the doctor on Tuesdays is really great and attentive. The nurses or medical assistance are very accommodating and professional, o have no complaint aside from the less friendly and unwelcoming front desk. Maybe someone should remind them to smile every once in a while.</review>< Date>

Greeted pleasantly, processed quickly and seen within @10 minutes (I did make an appt.). The technician who saw me was polite, efficient and explained what she was doing thoroughly. Although what I needed was simple, they were pleasant and efficient, which I appreciate.</text>

<Text>As my regular doctor didn't have any openings and my issue was quite urgent though not too complicated, I went to this clinic which happened to be the closest to my house. I got checked in very quickly and front desk people were nice. They moved me to the second floor and I got examined by a nurse practitioner. She was extremely attentive, asked all the appropriate questions (I'm a nurse myself so I can tell that), ran some tests and prescribed some pills. So I'm overall happy with the service provided.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I was in and out in 20 minutes! Amazing! I was able to make a same day appointment, which is SO helpful and rare for an urgent care center. I was seen by the doctor within 5 minutes of arriving, and all the staff was very efficient, friendly, and helpful. Hollywood Walk-In will always be my first choice for urgent care.</review>

Easy to make online appt. There were only male providers, but they were sensitive with this information and how a patient may feel. There was even a female nurse to be in the room. I must say Enrique was very warm, professional, and patient. Good listener, based on my medical history.< /text>

My Doctor was very nice, friendly and have to admit he is really cool lol, I and my husband have a great conversation with him about my chest pain during the visit and really helpful, we found out nothing is serious just some stress and anxiety.Very pleased with the service and the nurses are very wonderful, thank you.<//text>

Awesome!

Quick, affordable and most importantly FAST. Can't believe I didn't know about this place for all these years. They just charge $79 for a visit which covers most of the minor health issues like flu, sore throat etc. i had a terrible sore throat. Doctor prescribed me some antibiotics, took a test, gave me a shot and spent good amount of time explaining things and consulting. I am beyond happy with the level of service and the price I paid for it. It's clean and nice inside. They have Free WiFi and charging cables for your gadgets.

I will be recommending this place to all my friends and colleagues. Thumbs up!</Text>

The facility seemed pleasant enough.  For accepting no Medical or Medicare , the outer office good be a good deal more clean.  Worn out upholstery mingled in here and there, and the front door full of scratches in the glass along with the entire glass front while be clean and clear.  The facade was off putting to even want to put your hand to the door.

Upon walking to the receptionist counter, an Asian young woman uttered a very cold unwelcoming greeting barely making eye contact before quickly doing the routine verbal offering, issuing clipboard with instructions and sending me on my way to complete assignment before being granted permission to approach here.

Ok, so it's Hollywood at 5:45pm in the afternoon.  The facility is open till 8pm.  It's a health facility.  Good bedside manner starts at the front door especially when you look like a clean, well-educated white collar professional.  God forbid, walk-ins' in Hollywood less fortunate than I should have to withstand treatment and greeting that I experienced today or worse.  There is something  oddly wrong and ironic about being a walk-in clinic in Hollywood and not accepting of Obama Care - Medical.  This also explains and is in accordance with the less-than-friendly greeetng I received.  Yet, makes no allowances for the outer office condition I witnessed.</review>

I've never reviewed anything on google before but I've just been here and they were honestly amazing. I have been really sick with an infection for the last 5 days and went to an urgent care centre on Sunday (Hollywood Urgent Care on Melrose). They were absolutely hopeless. I am visiting from the UK so just have travel insurance. The woman was rude and basically said they can't accept travel insurance & it would cost $350 for the consultation then whatever extra on top. Which i couldn't afford. I then went to this place today and they were completely different and SO much cheaper! The initial consultation was only $79 compared to $350 and the total at the end came to $139! Plus the Doctors were SO nice. The Woman i saw was genuinely concerned about me and make me feel like she actually cared about me getting better. I would highly recommend going here if you're unwell 😊<//Text>

I love this place because it's so nice and easy! It's clean and you get in and out without too many complications. They are always cheap if you have insurance and they get the job done. The only thing that bothers me is the staff is not really all that friendly. They're respectful, but don't expect them to smile and be excited to check you in. Even the nurses are kind of dry and rude sometimes. Overall though, it's a really easy place to get basic health problems fixed!</text>

I saught this place out because I am uninsured, and wanted a place that would top notch if I was going to have to pay. I found that! I booked an appointment the same morning.

BOOKING AN APPOINTMENT
I booked an appointment online at 9 am for 11:15 am. Only 2 hours later! There were also tons of other appointment times after that, and the next days, open. They sent me a confirmation email within 20 minutes.

PARKING
I read online that there was parking available (which, honestly was part of the reason also). There's a small parking lot attached to the clinic @Wilcox and Selma, it fits about 10-12 cars maybe. You walk straight from the parking lot into the clinic!

PROCESS
I got there at 11, parked and went straight to the front desk. She asked if it was my first time, I told her, yes, and they gave me a short 1 pager to take your information down. I went back up and handed it to her, and my ID also (which they take if you're uninsured.)
I waited maybe 10 minutes, and they called me into the office (and gave me ID back when I walked in). They took me into the exam room, asked me some questions, took my vitals, weight, etc. The whole time, they've been super nice, professional and clear/concise.

After the vitals, she took me to another room and had me wait there for the clinician. 5 minutes later, the clinician, Amanda something, came in and asked me about my reasoning for being there. She was kind, patient, and listened to all my concerns, even made me feel calm. She offered (but didn't push) x-rays. So we talked a bit more and then she said to wait for the x-ray tech.

Waited maybe 5 minutes, and he came in and took me to the x-ray room. He gave me a gown to change into, closed the curtain to give me privacy and went away. When I was done, he took the x-rays and was very clear, but light-hearted about the whole thing.

I changed back and walked myself back to the room. Within 5-10 minutes, the clinician came back and told me about my results, and offered a prescription, and told me about their 1-week free follow up. So that if things change, to come back within a week if need be. She went to get a prescription and came back swiftly with it (easy to read one-page print out I took to CVS Pharmacy with ease). She directed me to visit the front desk on my way out to pay, which I did next. The prices listed in the pamphlet are clear, and there are no hidden fees or taxes to add. I paid $159 for the visit ($89) + x-ray ($70).

I got there at 11 for an 11:15 appointment, and was out by 12p.<//text>

The doctors are actually very kind and professional here. Clean environment and comfortable lobby area. However, the women at the front desk "forgot" to send in my lab work so I had to come back in for another test. Very sorely disappointed that this could happen. I hope this issue gets addressed. Otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I like the clinic itself, but this place is a rip off. They initially told me that I would only be paying $50 to get my ears cleaned out and the bill ended up being $129!!!!! The first time I only had to pay for the treatment and not the cost of the visit on top of it. This place would be great if they didn't try to nickel and dime poor people with no insurance. I would highly recommend this place otherwise, but this experience has turned me off to it, and I will take my business elsewhere next time.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I was here to be treat for Peri anal Abscess caused by riding bike with the hot seat (you know you leave your bike under the rays of the sun and then you seat on it without thinking that you putting your booty on the seat like putting ice cubes over an overheated surface)  Anyway I had an infection down there and before to know what I really had I did my own research on what I had ? and How I could fix it ..That's when This nice clinic pop up  in a matter of 3 to 5 clicks on the screen I made myself sure to be in the right place and this was the OUTCOME!    Good attention from everyone .  Prices?   Wow!!  For uninsured patients for me was a pleasure to be charge $400.00 from my DEBIT CARD for two interventions around the same spot. At the beginning it was kind of uncomfortably to speak with a female doctor about my decease when she was fixing me cause I was lay down Semi naked but the Ice broke opening a confident conversation between patient and doctor (3 different by the time everything was done)  and It's been a year since I was there thinking that I had something worse ,,, I'm still in healing process without any regrets for my decisions .

I liked the ambience of this location and found it quaint that they had old time starlet's photos on their walls... but the person who attended to me had a man bun and his hand smelled like weed with the attempt to be covered up by hand sanitizer. While nice, perhaps not the most attentive, as he told me I had a simple cold virus, but come to find out I had laryngitis AND a severe sinus infection.
I can't say I would be thrilled about coming here again and will look into other options in the future.< /text>

The clinic took care of a puncture wound and gave me a tetanus shot for about $130. While I could have gotten a tetanus shot for $75 at CVS, I was glad to have a doctor check out my injury and make sure it wasn’t anything serious.< /text>

I got a very deep cut on my shin bone. Basically to the bone. I do have ppo insurance, but I have a $1500 deductible. I went to the emergency room. When I asked for a price, they refused to give it to me. They probably will still charge me for talking to a nurse :/ Then I went over to the urgent care facility next door. At least they gave me a quote of around $880, to see a doctor, get stitched up and a tetanus shot. Before I committed, my brother found the Hollywood Walk In Clinic. They gave me a quote between $150 and $300 over the phone. I couldn't pass that up. I drove down. I did have to wait an hour before walking in, but can't really complain. Dr. Corey was really good. He said it how it was. Told me what I should and should get done. Definitely needed to get the stitches since my skin was split. Suggested I get a tetanus shot. I'm very grateful because they saved me over $700. Highly recommended, even with the wait.<//Text>

In and out even with 3 people ahead of me. This was at 11 am on a monday, so it wasn't very busy.  Very clean, complimentary tea and phone chargers, and free parking even if it's a tight fit. Staff is courteous and professional. Definitely recommend.<//review>

This is not affordable place though. 129$ for only 2 tests. So the reception is not helpful. She doesnt even explain the process. I havent received my test result yet. Nurses and doctors are OK.</review>

Came in on a Tuesday at noon, only 1 or 2 people ahead of me so I was seen within 10-15 mins. They take insurance, so instead of $89 it was $60 (and I have Aetna/crappy insurance through work).

Staff is friendly, organized, and I may have fallen in love with Michelle 😳.< /text>

As other reviews have mentioned these guys are pretty seamless!

I have a weird insurance where it is both HMO and PPO, but by default it looks HMO. The receptionist at first was going to turn my insurance away, but was happy to confirm it is in fact both!

The wait was really not a big deal! 30 minutes? Maybe? Including confirming my insurance. All staff were super friendly.

The PA answered all my questions, even some embarrassing ones I had with major professionalism and no judgement!

We were going to do a blood test, but my veins weren't cooperating, you can come back within 7 days for a free check up if your symptoms of whatever ailed you are persisting. I will be returning tomorrow to try and do my blood after I drink tons of water and not be dehydrated this time. :)

They diagnosed my simple cold as well! I wanted to double check since I am prone to bronchitis and was having major chest congestion! The office is very clean, there are phone chargers, wifi, tea/water, the music is spa like music to keep you relaxed.

I will be returning. I Might use them as more of my regular doc even though my deductible is higher ($25 vs $10), but they are very convenient.  I would have walked if I wasn't feeling so icky!<//text>

<Review>I felt looked after to the best of the ability/available services for my injury, and even though they were unable to provide an instant solution for me, they were able to provide the information I needed to get my injury fixed.

We have been to this place on numerous occasions.  I actually prefer this place over my son's pediatrician!  LOL  We've been coming here for 2yrs now & even though there might be a wait sometimes (depending on the time of day) it's BETTER than any Dr.'s office I've been in (regarding wait time) for sure!
My son has had issues w/a possible broken/sprained ankle as well as just being very ill & each & every time the staff is professional, timely, caring & patient w/my boy.  It's one of the FEW urgent care places around that will see kids.

I've read some of the other reviews of patients not being happy b/c whatever medication didn't help & they needed to find somewhere else to go but I would LOVE to address this.  I used to work for a pharmaceutical company & we used to joke about how too many Dr.'s kill an ant w/a sledgehammer.  This place DOES NOT do that!

When you're sick, the PA or Dr. 'should' give you something appropriate & NOT the strongest antibiotic out there in order to kill off the infection.  I don't want to go into too much detail to lose people here but you don't want to give someone a Fluoroquinolone when you could take a 3rd generation Cephalosporin.

The Dr./PA is actually looking out for you!  AND this clinic will see you FREE the 2nd time for the same issue if you're not getting better after the 1st appointment within 7 days!
So that takes care of "if you didn't get better" or the medication isn't "strong enough".  ;)< /text>

<Text>They take care of that which one might to have dealt with immediately but are not always seen as "urgent" or a"emergency" in a big corporate medical center where as much as they try to give you the personal attention and the Hand holding that means a lot to bed ridden folks who communicates and travels virtually through their fingers more than with their feet and their mouths just eat and say hello to attending nurses who say ",helloooooo Mrs osheeeeetahhhh! How are we doing today we have your 8 oclock lepadova and some oatmeal or "mush" as you call it and then some apple juice and a cup of banana slices.  Let's do your medication first and here I your water with the straw (WHICH SHE anD HER doCTOr REQUESTED!  We have the notarized affidavit so please do not arrest us!!!! We are ready for the popos!

Went in for a quick check up and was turned away because they were not taking anymore patients for the day. Would of taken 2 minutes but receptionist was more worried about getting out of work. If that's the case, close at 2:30 on Sunday not 3!</review>

The staff were polite and fast, their policies are transparent and fair, they have a free parking lot in a pricy parking part of town, and everything was clean and well maintained. Also? If you're bored in the waiting area they'll loan you an iPad.</text>< user_id>

<Review>During my extended stay trip to L.A. I needed to get a prescription refilled, one of those that you need to see a doctor every few months in order to do so. Found Hollywood Walk-In Clinic here on Yelp and the reviews were great. Not having insurance the $79  basic office visit charge seemed very reasonable. The location is on the corner of Wilcox & Selma. The sign on the building says "Urgent Care" & there is FREE parking in a fenced lot with about a dozen tight parking spots. It's caddy-corner from the Post Office if that helps.

The waiting room: clean with large windows, ample seating (vinyl on chairs is cracking),  tea bags and water for patients although the tea bags were gone by my late afternoon visit, flat panel tv was turned on but muted & a few magazines.

The receptionist: there were 2, not overly peppy & friendly but not rude.

The wait: 50 minutes in the waiting room then I was called back by a nurse who asked a few questions, took my blood pressure & put me in a exam room where I waited another 8-ish minutes for the doctor. I was seen by a PA and yes, she was super youthful looking but my issue was simple and she did go back and consult with, I assume a certified medical doctor, before writing my prescriptions. She took the time to listen & asked the appropriate questions. I figured while I was there I'd ask for an allergy nasal spray since I was starting to have an issue with my allergies and she gave me a prescription for that too.  She sent me back out into the waiting room and within a couple of minutes I was handed my prescription, paid and was on my way.  The prescription provided 2 refills which was great since I am stuck in L.A. for an unknown length of time.

The negatives: long wait to see doctor & the 2 guys who were coughing non-stop and not covering their mouths. I'm sure if I had asked for a mask to protect myself from their spewing germs they would have provided one but I kept thinking one of us would be called back and it would be over....my mistake, but its 2 days later and so far no signs of being contaminated with the flu. I had a flu shot for the first time this year thankfully.

I'd definitely go back here if the need arises.</Review>< userid>

First off this place has a parking lot thats a plus for me and when i got in the front desk was very nice she answered my question. When i was called in i guess by the nurse she took my blood pressure and stuff she was very polite made me feel at ease cause i was very nervious about the cyst the ruptured when she was done they took me to another room to wait for the doctor and in less than a minuet she was there asked me how im doing what was wrong and politely asked me to drop my pants to see the injury and was nice did i mention shes freaken beautiful so it made it easier than being a dude there so she prescribed me meds and im on my way. So recap from front desk, to nurse, to seeing a doctor in 15mins it was fast and it only cost me $89 even better and the cool thing is that if i need to go back to the doctors office its free withing the 7days after my visit. Ill be coming back forsure cause i dont have insurance but they also take insurance if you have it. Did i mention the place is very very clean and they have a variety of services all in one place. Too notch.< /review>
