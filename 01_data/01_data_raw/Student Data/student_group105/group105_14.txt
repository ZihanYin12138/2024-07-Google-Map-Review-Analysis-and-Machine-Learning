Nice little retreat.

Plenty of parking. Porta potties, sinks.

Trail has a lot of rocks, slight inclines, plenty of shade & a walking stick isn’t necessary (unless that’s how you hike). Plenty of pollen for allergies 🤧. Majority of the hikers did not wear masks (I do though). Also a great spot for photography.<//Text>

Amazing place. Must visit in Spring when the flowers are in bloom, and the water is flowing from the cliffs. Table mountain is a beautiful place where vintage California is on full display. Can be very crowded on weekends.< /Text>

It’s a gorgeous place if you are at the right time. You won’t get a chance to hike on a tabletop mountain everyday, specially when the wildflowers are at its peak. Trust me, its a spectacle. Only bummer is the crowd which can be overwhelming and distracting. Try to be early if you are planning to be on spring weekends.<//review>

<Review>Hiked to Phantom Falls with some friends on March 16th. The flowers were good, but had not peaked yet. Hike west from the parking lot for 0.4 miles, until you reach the old oak grove, and you will see the first trail sign.
We hiked to Hollow Falls also, and followed the trail posts to reach the pool at the bottom of the falls without having to scramble down a steep rocky slope.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Epic, wild flowers are amazing, and you are  definitely able to sit on the edge and let your feet dangle. Going back for the "super bloom" next month.<//Text>

<user_name>Holly Genevieve<//user_name><review>Trail was pretty easy. Definitely shorter than most that I have been on. When you use the directions on google maps make sure you find the directions that lead to the parking lot!!! I didn’t know that when I went and I got directions for phantom falls and it lead me to a different location! You have to make sure the location is on Cherokee road! The trail the whole time was very beautiful because of all the flowers in bloom right now and I would suggest going before they die or it might not be as nice. The waterfall isn’t super intense but it was still a very beautiful view and my friend and I even hiked to the bottom. If you do go to the bottom, do not bring dogs because people did and the dogs had a really hard time because the way to get there is really rocky.! There is a cave behind the waterfall so if you do bring a dog then be careful that they don’t go in the cave and fall. Overall, if you’re not going down to the bottom of the waterfall it’s only 6.5 miles and pretty easy. The views are amazing and getting to the bottom of worth it but be cautious and take your time getting down !< /review>< date>

Phantom Falls is one of the most unique waterfalls I’ve been to in CA.
Don’t forget to pay for a lands pass online.($5).
When I arrived at the trailhead,
I found out there was no trail at all.
I needed GPS and the All Trail App to help me and my cousin.
It is flat with rolling green hills and some wildflowers.( very pretty,amazing).
We followed an old fence and crossed over the fence.
There are 2 ways to get Phantom falls.
They are both the same distance and incredible view.
Getting down to the swimming pool of Phantom Falls was big adventure for us but it worth it.( we were using rope).
The view around Phantom Falls were spectacular.(you have to go down to the pool if you are here).
Some parts of the trail are muddy with a lot of small water  crossing.( hiking shoes with water roof is the best).
We were able to visit 4 waterfalls on our trip.
We didn’t have much water flowing but enjoy Landcape and wildflowers.
We will try to come back here again for wildflowers and the falls after few rains or sometime in early April.

Beautiful, moderate 5 mile round trip hike to Ravine and Phantom Falls. There is no designated trail but you can see make where the trail has been formed by other hikers. At one point, you can take the left fork to see a smaller  waterfall. But if you continue right to the fork you will see Ravine and Phantom. Beware of private property signs! Once you reach tall grass, there will be a sign that points you in the right direction. No spring flowers unfortunately but we went on a rainy day and had the trail all to ourselves.< /Review>

A very unique waterfalls that flows over the edge of a shear cliff and into a valley about a hundred feet below. I did not hike down into the valley to the base of Phantom falls since the trail was difficult to find and rather steep, also since the water flow was minimal when I went to the falls. The round trip to the overlook of the falls from the parking area is about 4 miles and well worth it. Best to go in spring after a rainfall to see the vibrant wildflowers in bloom and the falls with more flowing water.<//review>

The hike to phantom falls is beautiful in April! It's a few miles hike, so bring water and some snacks l, maybe even a picnic. Some people brought kites. Make sure you stay to the right at the fork in the hike to make it to the 'big' phantom falls. Also, all these pictures of the falls are posted from a rocky cliff. It's a straight drop down and I'm not gonna lie it scared me with my kids.
Tips for directions to the parking spot: on maps type in Cherokee Road, Oroville. Theres a fork in the road so make sure you stay LEFT on Cherokee Road. You will see some random parking spots but if you keep driving you will see port-o-potties on the side of the road and you will know your at the right spot.</review>

A pleasant walk to a waterfall. Just a couple of miles from the parking lot. The rocks can be loose on the trail, so wear some solid shoes. Bring water. Birds do use the cliff walls for the thermals,  there is a possibility of seeing large soaring birds.< /Review>

A beautiful hike unfortunately the falls was dried up and it was quite smokey due to the California wildfires. Will go back again probably in the winter/spring<//Text>

<Review>If you follow Google maps it will lead you to the photo with the sign. Look up Cherokee Rd, Oroville Ca. Follow the road and you'll find a decent sized parking lot next to several large cow pastures for the entrance. Beautiful hike. Couldn't hike all of it in one afternoon. Will definitely be coming back< /Review>< name>

Amazing hike! Probably about 2 miles to get go the big falls, then you can walk around the edge to find the way down to below the falls! There are some ropes to help you down because it's slippery- But once you're down, just stick close to the cliff and you can get all the way to the base of the waterfall. The mine entrance is down there as Well:)< /text>

<Text>We went to Phantom Falls in April 2018 shortly after the rains so that there was plenty of water running. We wound our way down into the canyon and enjoy the falls from the bottom as well. It was quite incredible! So very very beautiful and impressive! I haven't been here at any other time of the year but this year in April the flowers were gorgeous, small creeks running everywhere and worth every moment. We fell in love with it and came back for four weekends out of 5 so is to explore Phantom Falls Hollow Falls and the falls right there in the middle between the two. Exceptional, gorgeous. We did see people in flip-flops but I don't recommend that. Good walking shoes will save you every time.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-sgk4bc5ZDpyGmKp1_EvMbnbZPuRAZ80cTHs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPupaicOZB7CJuFsWemEm_NLn0E7CvO_fUEWik=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsoAd4Znmriji2eJ0ztuHOvOmLUFvsl0SwDDw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJWiA5j94eCRAEj1Wfz3q5LhMNJQKoYljUpCE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmgwwcvqGH9fVDdrmitiAnMHXMtJAzp0faqwU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1MRUoeYA0qfjNMt9CeBwd8QbaCjVI5S-sxtQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrCANV3zhAwNqSQOmAuyZNs3uaSzmDWQOf4tM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

Definitely worth checking out. No true trail to follow. Best way is to park at the parking lot, go through the gate and head towards the canyon for about 500 feet or so and then go right, you will see a faded path that leads north.<//Review>

While the path is hard to follow/find at first, it's worth the trek to the ravine. Currently the water isn't flowing (Nov 2020), but it was still pretty to see< /Text>

Very beautiful waterfalls I definitely recommend this hike to anyone.  It us fairly easy but there is little shade so it does get hot in the Summer.  The trail us fairly easy and not too difficult. A good day hike for sure. Lots of wildflowers everywhere in the spring time.< /Review>

Must see in north California.  Unique place.  Rough path so keep kids closer to you. First aid kit and water bottle are must.  Dress up for the day weather.  Long walt before you reach the falls.  Beautiful place.  There is a parking lot as well as road side parking available.< /Review>

Nice place to meander around and see flowers blooming in spring. Cows. Views of Sierra Buttes. Surprisingly grandiose waterfalls and gorges. Unfortunately, also pretty crowded.<//Text>

Just a peaceful area to enjoyed life. With friends, family or your love partner. You can choose from many types of hikes that suites your ability. You can visit all 3 falls if you have time. Once you get closed to the falls.

BEWARE!!! They are called Falls for a reason. People have gotten hurt and even paid the ultimate price. Don't let that discouraged you, the sites are worth seeing. Just be careful of your surroundings.

On your trip you'll see California Poppy and many wild flowers. BEWARE of the cow pies too. Hiking boots are a must if you want to wander and explored.

Message me if you like to hike it with me.<//text>

Hike was an easy flat hike. Once getting to phantom falls, it was more like phantom drip. You can get a bigger waterfall from a garden hose on top of a fence. Won't do it again especially taking awhile to find the start of the hike since of personal property signs telling you to go on Cherokee road.</Text>

Decent views. Make sure you get there in April (I was too late for the wildflowers). The falls were also a bit underwhelming for the hike required to get there.</review>

<Date>1556306828055</Date><user_name>Steve Schmorleitz</user_name><Text>The best time to hike to Phantom Falls is in the spring. April and May are ideal. At this time of year of the wild flowers are blooming profusely. The waterfall itself, only flows during the winter and spring. The hike to the waterfalls is fairly easy. It is a fairly level hike with small ups and downs along the way. It is about 4.75 miles round-trip. Don't forget to stop along the way to admire the two waterfalls commonly referred to as Twin Ravine Falls.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< pics>

<review>We saw 3 waterfalls and tons of wildflowers. This is one of my new favorite hikes!! We also climbed down a pretty steep trail with ropes to get to the bottom of phantom falls. It was quite an adventure! We did about 6 miles round trip. I highly recommend it! Lots of people on the trail on the weekends though.<//review>< pictures>

Just as the Table Mountain Reserve that contains Phantom Falls deserves five stars, the falls themselves also deserve a solid five stars. The setting is amazing, the falls are extremely impressive. On the right day, you'll even get rainbows showing in the falls.

One can also hike down to the base of the falls, and hike behind them. There is even a historic mine shaft behind the falls that one can view.

This is an amazing destination in Spring.<//Text>

Tabletop mountain is beautiful in the spring with all the greenery and wild flowers in bloom. Beautiful place to spend the day hiking or flying kites or having a nice picnic. Nice to see all the little waterfalls up there after a good rain.< /text>

Pretty waterfall. Go in February to April for wild flowers. Shade non-existant in the summer. There is a sign that says you need either a fishing license, hunting license, or cdfw lands pass.< /text>

This is a spectacular hike during a narrow window of time each year. You need to go when the wildflowers are at their peak in the spring (the timing differs each year, check for wildflower reports online) and a couple days after it rains so that there is water in the falls. We did a loop to Phantom Falls then to Ravine Falls at the end of March. There was no trail to Phantom Falls, and there were so many wildflowers that in order to hike anywhere you needed to crush the beautiful flowers under you feet :-\ There was a route on the far side of Phantom Falls to the bottom of the falls where we checked out the cave formation and the Coastal Range newts swimming in the pool below. Make sure to bring a map as there will likely be no discernible trail to Phantom Falls. The parking lot can be found at these coordinates: 39.595923, -121.541736</review>

< Review>
0 Stars, The two new posts about the property and management are from the new managers and corporate owners , so of course they're just going give themselves a sterling review. The amenities listed here are falsified, you can take a look at the "sparkling pool" through the photos uploaded with this review and see the bs for yourself.</Review>

the manager is a very hardworking and sweet lady. her and maintenance do their best to keep this park in the best shape they can with the little support that they have. this place has a lot of potential but many of the residents make it difficult.</text>

I can call she picks up the phone.she has helped old and disabled people to clean up there yards. Anytime I have questions she's there. Since ive been here this park had 2 managers they were lyed, over charged, never picked phones  , never in the office. They were worthless.
The new owners got a good manager in here. This park was vary dirty when this manager came in here. Still needs a lot of work. But she's doing what she can to s straten up this park. She cares more then anyone ales has.
Yes everything went up in Price. I'm happy with the street I live on in this park. Its getting cleaner InThis park then it was. Still has a way to go.
I give the management 5 star's< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Now under a professional management company. Been at this park since 2015. Had some updating and park is located in a nice location. Gone from 3 stars to 2 stars. Had nice trees and greenery until new management butchered them. Is located in a nice area, convenient to everything. They have increased the rent pretty much annually, overcharge on utilities, but it is still affordable. Homes are "vintage", so anyone moving in one needs to be able to do repairs. Current manager is personable. Regional manager is problematic.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c367e4fc6a93ab:0xfb4c9631f39a6778< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I've unfortunately lived here for almost 16 years. This mobile home park is where hope goes to die. Not only is this place filthy and disgusting, the management is god-awful. All they do is collect rent checks. It's a maddeningly noisy place to live. It sounds like you're living in a dog pound. The neighbors blast music all night outside with amplifiers. Most of the good residents have been threatened by the bad ones, a few of the older residents are afraid to leave their mobile homes because of horrible neighbors. Management refuses to do anything, and yet the rent keeps going up. The electricity randomly goes out often, sometimes 2-3 times a day. The water is randomly shut off without notice, sometimes for hours. I've had better luck reporting this place to code enforcement. I wish i could give zero stars! Currently looking into moving. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!<//text>< Pictures>

We stopped in for some coffee and to try a waffle. While we only got a plain waffle and cappuccinos, it was very good! I would absolutely come back to try more of their menu.<//Review>

Got the savory waffle and the s'mores waffle. We got the smoked turkey and the guda on the savory waffle, it was very good. The savory reminded me of a grilled cheese, but there was small bits of carmalized sugar on the bottom side of the waffle. The added sugar was a nice little bit of sweetness, which if you are looking for just a savory taste may not have been the best option. The s'mores waffle had speculoos, dark chocolate and marshmallow cream. The combination did a great number of recreating the s'mores flavor and experience. There was a small bit of burnt marshmallow that just added to the campfire taste.<//text>

<time>1616899714159<//time><Rating>2</Rating><Review>Very disappointed by this place. Multiple issues made this a bad meal for me.

First the table we were sat at was wobbly, which became an issue with the wide coffee mugs. My girlfriend ended up spilling coffee on her dress, shoes, and our dog.

When our food arrived we were shocked at how small the waffle was even though we had spent so much on the food. The waffle tasted good and so did the strawberries but for how much we paid it was not worth it.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWWozmXnGd6fQBoTaf2m4WQ9wspcNJ0QIig1p2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<review>"VOTED BEST WAFFLE IN AMERICA"?!
I don't think so.
Let's start with the good....our server even though a little slow was friendly and I could tell she was doing her best. It was the food that really disappointed me...actually to a degree where I felt almost ripped off. Here's why: When you go to a waffle place that specialized in waffles...you expect their waffles to be fresh! We waited close to 25 min, but I figured if it's fresh then it's worth the wait. The waffle was very stale, old and crunchy....like it had been sitting out the day before and they just refrigerated it over night and served the next day. Toppings are additional cost..which to be honest, is a bit surprising...considering most people expect something on their waffle (and this place is not cheap).
The Poached Eggs Plate was equally disappointing. I almost let out a chuckle when it got served. I've had better eggs and sausage at McDonald's - no seriously! The sausage was hard and too greasy and the eggs were your average tasteless...low quality with no seasoning eggs...if you're going to put paprika on eggs...sprinkle at least a little salt.
Voted Best Waffle...No! and unfortunately I won't go back even for ...well...anything.
You don't charge prices like this...where everything is additional like it's a steakhouse...and then serve your customers that degree of quality. :(<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkuLxj0UN7ztgCmrBE-kIT-rXyaOMkExQZKArr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAo6vZ8DySBBnmJ0easebjoY7-Bv4wAPOjvgZT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5M3r03BGaSdSOhVrAtxi-px_WF9c9jcIATO4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfXmLKgfDCiASKRYlonFsIaRPHCXguZwaNCNQK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6Rb-13_j67UjQmuX02uOLdSuGKynctUwFBAWv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMidPRh2Bj4KZH5ghwQT8qbH58P4lty0uQWgrc6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLkrP0NnIQlUSyUYMOg14ku-Effn3YRIExU1do=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

They say they won a prize for best waffle in the usa. Doubt it. The belgian waffles here are a bit off. You feel sugar grains in the waffles. Don't like that. Not sure they have the recipe right. Still this is the best belgian waffle I know about in Los Angeles.

Everywhere else shops commit the serious crime of selling you "upscale" eggo waffles or worse as "belgian". Yes, belgium came up with waffles but to he called belgian they need to at least try to make them authentic not just call them that. Belgian waffles are not sponges. They are relatively dense and rich. Some of the waffles out there are as belgian, as taco bell tacos are Mexican.</review>

The waffles are great but way too expensive for what you get. They’re clearly very understaffed cuz we waited for more than an hour for a small waffle.</text>

Their violet lemonade is a must, especially in this heat! It freezes and then blends with vodka very well. Their waffles really are the best, hard to pick a favorite. Highly recommend.</review>

A very different style of waffle. There are combinations of flavors that don't sound good but taste incredible. Don't be afraid to order out of the box. Sriracha is great on the waffle believe it or not.</Text>

Friendly staff and phenomenal tasty waffles and tea! I usually hate restaurant waffles, but these are crispy, fluffy and pack a unique flavor. Fruit is fresh and flavorful, and chai has a well-rounded flavor and frothy milk. They have milk alternatives, too. If you're an omnivore, try the caramel bacon - not sweet, just right. Only neg is parking for this area is tight!< /Review>

Really wonderful waffles! Unique, delicious. Make sure to try the buttercream. Their latte was okay, seemed very milky. Cold brew is quite bitter/sour.. I’ve had regular brewed iced coffee that was better unfortunately. But their chai latte is very good.

I adore that they have outlets and decent WiFi :)< /Review>

<review>The waffles really are amazing although they come in small portions. They are a little pricey but if you’re a waffle fan they’re worth it! Very small cafe not meant for large parties. Great service!</review><time>1547678574053< /time>< name>

this is absolutely ridiculous. hot green tea with usual tea bag in the “to go” mug is 5$. why? but chai tea latte is 5,5$. and because of constantly waffles smell you need to take a shower immediately. so disappointed with this place.< /text>

<Time>1541876649320</Time><Review>The waffles are small and stiff. I returned my food b/c the egg and meat are cooked in microwave. They didn’t look appetizing at all. Should specify on the menu that they are cooking in the microwave. Initially, when my friend asked about eggs over medium the waiter said yes it could be done. However, when reading back the order he changed the egg order to scrambled soft. I asked why he changed it to soft scramble. He then said they couldn’t do over medium eggs. For me, not a good spot for breakfast b/c I like traditional breakfast items such as eggs and meat cooked in a skillet. Service was sub-par. Waiter should do better at explaining food options.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><userid>117661403908460202242< /userid>< rate>

Asked for a gluten-free muffin. Had a great talk about food sensitivity. Pretty sure it was all lies and he just sold me up on a wheat flour muffin. Sick and in pain all the next day. Really annoyed that people don't take it seriously or aren't competent enough to remember which is which. This is not a food preference. It very negatively impacts my life. I would have bought fruit, hot chocolate, or anything else. Never going here again.< /review>

Good quick breakfast. The side of eggs was far from extraordinary, I'd stay away. The waffle itself is good. Not extraordinary either - just good. Nice staff. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I were in the neighborhood I'd swing by to grab a bite on the go.< /review>

Poor quality for the price. Watched them microwave the meat and eggs for my savory waffle. Also, they had the front door propped open which was nice for the breeze but there were a lot of flies on every surface. The food prep area was pretty messy especially considering it's in plain view from the counter. The waffles tasted good but would have tasted better if I didn't know the dough was sitting out uncovered with flies around.<//Text>

<Text>I know what they were going for here, and failed. Had a waffle and latte. Overpriced. Latte was enjoyable, but not enough to account for the employees obnoxious code of music and incompetence in coustomer service. Too bad because an authentic Belgian waffle is one of the best things in this world.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

One of my favorite restaurants for breakfast/brunch.  Their Liege waffles are the best Belgian waffles I've had here in the States.  I usually go for the Chocolate Hazelnut Swirl with strawberries and banana.  They also make a delicious London Fog.  For all the vegans out there, they offer tasty steelcut oatmeal with fresh fruits.  Lastly, they offer thirst-quenching freshly squeezed orange juice.</Text>

I loved this place, brought my friends and do mini dates with my husband. It was my go-to place UNTIL the man making the food tried to guilt me into giving a tip every though I was taking the food to go. And took care of two customers and had me wait. He asked if I was going to give a tip because he needed to add to my check. When I said no I wasn't leaving one. He proceeded to remind that he is making the food. He started to make a ruckus in food prep area and was visibly upset. Made no eye contact, give his back to me the entire time and practically threw the bag of food at me. Then walked away. Why should I be punished, if I choose to stick to my budget? I thinking of giving cash instead. I was not sure if I had it so I didn't want say anything until I checked. I found few bucks to give, but after that treatment,  I kept it and walk out. When I open the bag, it looked so ill presented, the food never before look that way.Unfriendly...down right nasty.What a waste my time and money. So disappointed.<//Text>

Shaky Alibi introduced me to the wonder that is vanilla lemonade, and for that delicious drink alone they deserve five stars. Cozy, attractive place with pleasantly eclectic music. Would definitely visit again.<//Review>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>Great place to enjoy a strong caffeinated drink and perhapses a waffle on the side?

Ive been lucky enough to pop in here a few times and kill some time while kiddo finishes her theater classes near by. I find the Shaky Alibi to be a great place to relax with some (as mentioned before) a strong caffeinated drink. Im a fan of their lattes! They're perfect and deliver the perk one needs and especially in the afternoon! As for the waffles...I think this is depends on the day you show up or who is making them. I haven't had a consistently good one for all the times Ive been in here. Granted the 1st one I did have was excellent! It was a taste of heaven. After that however...its been more like "okay I've paid for it, I may as well eat it.". So it seems that something is falling through the cracks when it comes to quality control? But I will say that the coffee and other hot drinks remain consistently great!!! I hope things improve in the waffle dept. Maybe it has?

Ill wrap this up by saying that the customer service is great too. Always polite and punctual. Definitely tip worthy. Metered parking all around too.< /Text>< date>

Wonderful Whimsical Waffles!!!
What a little gem that can be easily over-looked. They've got a wide variety of coffees, expresses, teas... and of course, waffles! There's even some savory sweets for those cravings for a waffle sundae or a root beer float. The super-friendly staff tops off this experience with A+ service!<//review>

<review>Really chill environment. Wasn't crowded and the vibe is very cozy and relaxing. David was very welcoming and helpful. I suppose it's easy to become apathetic about your job after a while, but he greeted me with enthusiasm and explained the menu very well - including letting me sample the speculoos and explaining what cold brew coffee was and that their waffles are made with a dough instead of batter. His recommendations were excellent and I enjoyed my waffle and Mocha Latte (which I appreciated for it's more subtle chocolate approach).

There's lots of seating and it seems laptop friendly. This would be a great place to get some work down. My only disappointment is with the operating hours - I feel that they close a little too early for my schedule, which means I won't get to be here as often as I'd like, but I also realize my expectations might be really high. Coming from NYC, I love late night culture. Guess I'll have to stick to Crave Cafe for my midnight oil.

Overall, this place was really neat, menu was easy enough to understand and I feel you really get that eclectic cafe vibe from here.</review>< gmap_id>

Don't let the small size deceive you. The waffles are dough based and are simply delicious! Haven't tried the savory ones yet, but I hear they are also amazing.

Oh wow. First time going here and it simply amazing. The waffles are made with a dough type of thing rather than the runny watery batter that I'm used to.

I had an egg sandwich and I definitely can't wait to come back again and try other stuff!</Review>

Their waffles are delicious and customizable (everything from milk chocolate spread to bacon, ham, cheese, etc. to allow for a lunch or sweet waffle). They come warm; when we visited the shop they had free samples. Very reasonably priced: $5.50 for a traditional waffle (toppings extra). Their hot chocolate was lovely, and the staff was very courteous and happy to answer questions and customize orders. Go! It's a cute somewhat hole-in-the-wall place.<//text>

I came here for breakfast, and I am so happy that I did; the waffles are outstanding, especially the Sausage Gouda waffle. I'm looking forward to trying the other delicious-looking waffles next time!
Also, the staff is very friendly and the décor of the café brings out a cozy vibe to the place! Definitely go here if you are looking for satisfying breakfast food or drinks. A good place to bring kids, too.</review>

Shaky Alibi's Liege Waffle is one of the ten best things to eat in Los Angeles. I'm serious. There is something so yeasty and crunchety and warming about these waffles. Stop by for a few minutes to try one, and then try to resist stopping by again the next day for another.</review>

I was there few weeks ago with my family, to be honest it needs new owner or management Fake reviews that how good it is, over priced for tinny 2"X 3" inch waffle in a cheap setting and if you happen to look under the baby booster you will run out, Fake good reviews.</text>

Ez on and off of 101, decent amount of parking even hours early. A bit of a hike to check in, but we truckers can use some exercise. Dock is efficient, check in and out are as well.</review>

Typical produce warehouse, the waiting is too long. Drivers regulated clocks run out and they don't care, kick you off the lot to make you drive illegal and find all but impossible places to park. They don't let drivers on the dock to inspect, or instruct how they need the load loaded for safety and securement.< /Review>

Place is extremely busy, very badly set up and not enough room to accommodate  drivers coming in, they fill up their  parking  lot and want you to park illegally  on the street and walk to check in. Has a small food truck and porta pottys for drivers.  6 hrs for 8 pallets and  was 2 hrs early for appointment<//Review>

Picked up partial load from here. Checked in 2 hrs before my appointment time. Dock in 30 minutes and loaded in 1 hour. Dirt Parking lot behind dock for wait. Portable bathroom available for drivers. Drivers not allowed on docks while loading. Taco truck at location. Too many reviews  about long waiting. maybe my lucky day loaded before my appointment time. 😊</review>

Waited for a door. Finally got one after waiting. Backed in and got a call asking us to get out of the door because they don't have a quality control person here to check our product for another 2 hours..is this a joke? Meanwhile this Mexican lady pulls in and parks where she isnt supposed to. Where I watched the "security guy" tell 2 trucks to move already and she goes in gets a door and is loaded and leaving. This place is a joke! I will update when we actually get loaded if I don't blow a gasket and get kicked out.<//review>

<Text>For me one of the most worst places to pickup the produce.  I had appointment 5:00pm and I got door 7:30pm, they loaded 4 pallets and said I have move my truck to parking yard because rest of product is not ready, till now is almost 21 hours in park yard still waiting. I went couple time to check status of my order they keep saying your next in line. Ugly parking lot dirt everywhere.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

By 11:15 I was docked at the door and immediately started getting loaded. Most of the other shippers especially in Salinas will have you waiting 6 to 10 hours. So thumbs up to you guys.

Arrived at 1.30 for 2 appt. Got a call for door at 3. Was out at 3.30 (5 pallets). Parking can b hassle. If u can stick around u might find somebody moving. Enough room to back safely unless u got trucks blocking ur way (most certainly u will during busy hours).</text>

Been here multiple times, worst experience ever. Makes you Wait all night just to pick up 5 pallets and in the morning tell you the product is not ready. Then why you give appointment at first place when you know the product is not ready? Such a poor management<//review>

This place is a serious joke.  Decline their orders. They make you wait for 2 days. Rude staff and absolutely rude supervisor. Never ever seen a place like this. There’s no parking anywhere and they tell you to find a parking spot somewhere else, that’s ridiculous considering it’s a truck. 1 star is even too much for their rating.< /text>

<review>This place needs a lot of work!  Easy Dock Access,  But,  don't be Early because you Can't Park There! They only have parking for about 8 Trucks and the place is Always Jacked Up with the Farm Trucks as they are to stupid to use or have a second Entrance.  There's also No One Available that's Live at the Check in Point. You have to Call on a Phone to Reach Anyone,  You Must Have An Appointment Before Coming There, But,  You have to Come there to get the Appointment Phone Number because you can't call Shipping or Receiving and get it that way.  Like I said this place on Person to Person Contact Sucks.  The Guard at the Gate, he was the only one that has information and that knew what was going on. The Shag Driver also is Very Nice and Helpful.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x8091feb61d3ea8d3:0xad466a83da61f9fa</gmapID></record>

< Review>
This is the most unorganized , congested shipper in the valley. I have been here more than a few times...it is an accident waiting to happen. They have no regards for the Federal Laws and Mandates. They do not provide  actual facilities,  but filthy portable pots for bathrooms. It is just a horrible rotten muddy mess if it is raining and a dust bowl when not. All I know is I tell my family and friends to not buy their products.
They have no regards to the fact we have human needs, like sanitary toilets, sleep, safety for our vehicles and persons.  It's  just a filthy dirty rotten place to find yourself...I hate it every time I come here...<//Review>

Just plain sucks.. the parking and check in issues for a facility this size... are beyond asinine.... the me first drivers, like the dude who forced his way past me at the window in the middle of my check in and was served due to his belligerent attitude are prevalent. This is a place that requires deep breathing and a knowing that you dont have to stay or work here for longer than it takes to load...<//text>

<text>This place is terrible three hours so far to get unloaded and still they have not call me for a door to back in, five truck show up after three hours of waiting for a door and they give them a door in less than 15 min. My question is,  do they give them money so they can get a door that fast. I mean that's the way it has to be or why do they take so long to get you in a door. Because I have product that is there's but why so much  waiting for some driver. Sucks,<//text>< response>

Communication problems can happen at check in. Be careful.  Very little parking. Cannot show up more than 1 hour ahead of appointment time. Watch surrounding roads for no trucks allowed. Hunch probably watched by patrolman closely.< /review>

Quick loading. Be sure to have an appointment and be on time. Make sure your trailer is pre-cooled. 3/4 of the problems I see drivers have here are the driver's own fault, or result from drivers being rude to staff. Seriously. Be on time and be polite. Parking at rear of building if you are early.</text>

<review>This is probably the worst place we have ever picked up from. They left us sitting on the side of a dirt road for hours. And once we got to the dock they wanted $5 a pallet to move around so the product would fit. And they wanted cash ONLY!!! What a bunch they are.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8091feb61d3ea8d3:0xad466a83da61f9fa</GmapID></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Without words a dump.
For those who are sitting on a desk making new laws for the troquero I would like to be accompanied in places like this to realize the life we ​​have in places like this.
1. No parking
2. Portable bathrooms only 3, to give service 24 hours.
3. They give you a door and it jumps because you do not adjust the product, you get in and they do not let you sleep

A STAR AND IT IS A LOT WHAT I GIVE YOU

(Original)
Sin palabras un mugrero.
Para esos encorbatados que estan sentados en un escritorio haciendo leyes nuevas para el troquero me gustaría que nos acompañaran en lugares como este para se dieran cuenta la vida que llevamos en lugares como este.
1. No estacionamiento
2. Baños portatiles solo 3,  para darle servicio las 24 horas.
3. Te dan puerta y que salte porque no te ajustamos el producto,  que metete que ya llego no te dejan dormir

UNA ESTRELLA Y ES MUCHO LO QUE LES DOY< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x8091feb61d3ea8d3:0xad466a83da61f9fa</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Ordered my parts on the 10th (Sunday) because they respond even when closed & he got them out Monday. Gave me my tracking number 2 days later & they arrived today the 18th. Nick always stays on top of his customers packages & needs. I’ve ordered all my genesis coupe parts from him & never had a problem with him or receiving anything late. Keep up the good work!<//review>

Glad to take your money, but when you have warranty concerns, they do not respond. We tried calls, email, FB messages, and nothing. Plenty of other shops out there. Save yourself the headaches.< /text>

I drive an hour to have my car serviced through them , as far as I’m concerned he’s the best mechanic I have ever worked with. The Hyundai tried to charge me $1000.00 for a service that cost me less than $200.00 here. Honest and reliable ,you don’t find that very often.

<review>Henry at the front desk was very good about explaining everything to me. Met Hugo in the garage and he is very friendly and knowledgeable. They gave me options and pricing for everything and did their best to accommodate my needs. The lengths they went to try to find a specific backing to the driver seat that had come off was proof that they'll go the extra mile. With the job completed, they've made a loyal customer and will get my referral. Great group of guys. Highly recommended.</review>< pictures>

The ONLY place to take your Genesis Coupe no matter how far away you live it's always worth the drive. Props to Oscar for installing a couple choice mods (megan motor mount and injen SRI) as well as changing out all my oils - engine, MT, and diff.

Will definitely be back for my next service and with more parts ordered beforehand to put onto the car in preparation. Probably shifter bushings and engine leash.< /Review>

KIA-Hyundai Auto Repair is wonderful... I found that Hugo and his team are honest, fair, and friendly. They went above and beyond with fixing my car on 2 separate occasions. I am thankful to have found them. This is the only place I will take my car from now on. I highly recommend  them.< /Review>

Very pleased each time I come in for service. The work is performed at a reasonable rate and the quality is why I would recommend these guys. Specializing in these car lines makes me feel like going to the dealer without the high cost.<//review>

Order and HID kit and Fogs and they lacked on communication when they should of been on top of my order. Purchase on the 19th. On the 20th Was told ill have my tracking info the next day. No word from them. Just plain with responce and i can tell they didnt care givng how they responded. Its now the 22nd and after i emailed them around noon. 3 hours later i get my tracking numbers and guess what?, i missed my package!  Now have to take time of my schedule all because they wasnt on top of communicating with me.  Only bought from them due to word of mouth. First and last time they get my business<//Review>

Waited 9 weeks for my order to ship. Only got 2 follow ups with no progress in my shipment. Demanded refund. Whether if it's a customer online or in person, customer service should be the same for all. Ridiculous.< /Review>

Went in for air suspension work, to redo my lines and get in a new compressor. Told me they would hardline everything but my lines literally look the same from when I brought my car in originally. (Not hardlined) And on top of that he gave me a cheap compressor from Harbor Freight. Also rerouted my suspension air purge to the beginning of my lines where my head unit is so it releases air inside the car rather then at the struts outside of the car. Also deleted my tank drain line so I wasnt able to empty my tank with compressed air on the regular to get any water buildup out. 2 bit mechanics that overcharge.< /review>

< review>
So far I’ve had a very bad experience with this place. They’re customer service is less than bad. I’ve called so many times and even emailed and nothing. I placed an order for some lowering springs, and it took them two weeks to tell me they weren’t in stock ( maybe not their fault because they contacted Megan racing) but still I had to keep bothering them to see what was going on. Then I just asked for a refund, ( they said it would take 1-3 business days) I called on a Wednesday and now it’s been almost two weeks and no money for me. Hopefully they fix their issues, I don’t think I’ll be shopping here anymore.< /review>

AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!! We had a very negative experience here.  After taking our car in to get the water pump replaced, the timing belt broke on Winchester road during rush hour because it was not put back on properly during the repair.  They wouldn't own up to the fact that it was because their mechanics didn't put it back on correctly.  This damaged the motor and they took two weeks to replace the head of the engine.  They took it to another city to "work on it" without letting us know first.  Every time I called, they said it would be done that day or the next day, and then they would never call me back.  When I went to pick it up, there was coolant leaking...< /Text>

Nicholas is nothing short of AMAZING! He is professional and courteous. The turn-around time was much faster than expected, and the quality of his photos are brilliant! When it comes to Real Estate Photography, Nicholas is hands down the best in the biz!< /Text>

<Review>I have several Miller.Photo pieces in my apartment and I absolutely love them.  Nick's photos are absolutely stunning and they have the ability to bring rooms to life.  His talent is unmatched.  Without fail, I get compliments on each piece every time someone comes over to my apt.<//Review><user>108286043526476546585<//user><GmapID>0x809ad0c35cf6a681:0xef9cc95042c868cb< /GmapID></record>

I cannot say enough good about Miller Photo. Punctual. Practical. Professional. A pleasure to work alongside. Miller photo has the systems in place, standards, and creative eye my clients need to see the best in and from their property photos. My clients are always pleased with their work and personal attention to detail. As a valued part of my marketing and onboarding team they have, each and every time, represented my  business and brand well both in person and in print. I cannot say enough good about Miller Photo. See for yourself. They say a picture is worth a thousand words.</review>

We recently renovated The Courtyards at Venetian Terrace (Active Seniors Apartments in Stockton) and asked Miller Photo to take photographs of the entire project for our Web Site and New Brochure. The photographer were very professional and the photographs were exceptional. We highly recommend their services.</review>

<text>I use Miller.Photo for all my Real Estate Listing photos.  They are easy to schedule, on time, reasonably priced and the photography is great.  Nicholas spends the time to insure the shot is right AND the light and color are optimal.

Working with Miller Photo was a great experience. I represent agents working out of the area and he was very flexible with our schedule. He got in the home quickly to meet our tight deadline and delivered beautiful photos that were easily loadable to the MLS. Miller Photo is quality work that will make any listing shine. If you book with Miller, you won't be disappointed.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>My first photo shoot by Miller Photo was a 're-do' . . . I thought my personal photos of my listing would be enough for MLS and my marketing needs. Not the case. The day after Nicholas reshot my listing, my client had an offer. Enough said - Miller Photo has been my first call ever since. The most recent photo shoot was conducted by Nicholas and Nick and, once again, I have the most amazing pictures to showcase my new listing. Thank you!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809ad0c35cf6a681:0xef9cc95042c868cb</gmapID></record>

<text>Nick, Liz, & the whole Miller Photo team do an absolutely amazing job! I’ve used just about all of their services; standard rental listing photos, MLS listing photos, twilight photography, drone photography and even videography. They have never failed to impress us or my clients. They know how to truly showcase properties in their best image. You will not go wrong selecting Miller Photo as your photographer and videographer for your real estate needs.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Every one of the associate photographers at Miller.Photo is outstanding! Their reputation for super quality work and top-notch professionalism in every aspect continues to spread throughout N. CA. More and more Realtors, and often entire offices, simply will not settle for just any photographer. I don't blame them. Why would they. I will never use another photographer because doing so would be a violation of my fiduciary responsibility to my clients. They are simply the best!<//Review>

Miller.Photo has been helping me since they started and Nick is one of the most talented and creative photographers I have used. He does great Real Estate Photography but is versatile in doing all types of shots. I have also purchased many of his art photos on metal or canvas of local attractions. I would recommend him highly but I just hope he does not get too busy for me in the future :-)< /Text>

<review>This place is a joke. My food sat on the same counter money is exchanged on for 10 minutes after she told me it wasn’t ready. Also opened and closed my container 6 times to see what was inside, never seen her wash her hands in the 35 minutes I was waiting, after touching everybodys dirty money. Charged me for a Thai tea but said I never order a Thai tea. They got prepackaged fish sitting on the ground for who knows how long. I just threw this food in the garbage. Waste of 40 dollars.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Great Chinese and Japanese food. They have the best Pho soup around. Pho is a delicious Vietnamese soup that comes in several flavors with a delicious broth & rice noodles. You can customize the toppings & sauces to your liking. Lots of sushi and rolls to choose from as well as teriyaki bowls and fried rice. The owners are great ladies. We dine here weekly. My favorite is the beef Pho soup. The pot stickers & egg rolls are delicious too. They are closed from 3-5pm.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOS4dmnXGPsXID4dc8HXaNBz1i9DrhZanw76sW8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< username>

It's barely okay.  Very pricey and the staff doesn't seem to care if you come in or not.  Wait area is not very clean.  I won't be back.</text>

My go to place for sushi. Tulare roll is undefeated. Never had any better anywhere else. I really enjoy that their rolls are larger than most too. Most places have rolls half the size! Great when ordering online as well; have yet to disappoint.</review>

<text>Food here takes little while to get to your table. There was only 1 one person working outfront taking orders on the phone & to the tables. Also same person was cleaning all the tables & bringing the food. You guys will offer a better service if you hire someone else. My husband ordered a sushi and I ordered pho. They got the sushi first and it took while to bring my soup.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< user_name>

I moved in with my sister recently and was worried that there might not be a good sushi place nearby by. I love sushi, and have been to a good share of good and bad restaurants. I'm glad to say I am satisfied with Tokyo place. The waitress was friendly, and the sushi was good (we tried 3 different rolls). While we were there we even talked to some other customers about their favorite dishes. I have no complaints, and I'm glad to have found somewhere nearby to go when I have sushi cravings!</review>

first day I went I ordered a roll and Sashimi. the roll came out fairly quick the sashimi took about 40 minutes and still wasn't done. So I walked up to register to ask and lady said it was almost done, so I told her sorry but you have to cancel that it took too long a have to go back to work. So got really upset and was very rude, she said the lady chef was really mad at me for canceling it. I said well it shouldn't of took that long.<//review>

I ordered shrimp yakisoba. The noodles were instant and the shrimp had turned. It’s decently cheap, but not for the quality.</Text>

볶음밥 쌀국수가 입맛이 잘 맞고 맛있음. 롤도 맛있었음. 고급 식당은 아니고 평범함.< /Text>< response>

Worst insurance company I have ever worked with. Going to go back to Progressive. Got rear-ended, not at fault, called to file claim. Seems like it's a third party answering service taking the calls rather than the company. The woman was cold, and didn't care whether or not I was ok. That's fine, I got over it. But then the agent I was given is non-responsive and barely helpful at best. It's been over 3 weeks since my accident and I was waiting on another call back from the agent because for the second time the "quick fix' app won't work. CSE wants me to use the app to upload my VIN# and pictures of care, etc. Right, because I pay them and they don't have my VIN and don't want to send out an adjuster. Tried their app again, wouldn't work. I called and left a message last Saturday about problems with app AGAIN, agent finally calls me today to ask why I haven't used the app. Apparently he doesn't check his messages either, where I clearly explained the issues. I started to tell him I can't enter my VIN on their app and he says, "Remember" we already fixed the app. NO, they only fixed the first problem where their app wouldn't work in my area.  3 weeks and my insurance has done absolutely nothing. State Farm (at fault insurer) is slowly helping me finally.
Do not use this company, they don't care about their clients. Went through past reviews and everyone experiences the same thing. Even saw my agent's name in one of the reviews, looks like he is known for no response. Thanks for nothing CSE. Cancelling my home and auto insurance with you very soon!</Text>

<Review>I’ve had the worst experience with this insurance company! Not only does my agent not reply, but I’ve had a call out to have my car towed for 6 days and they have not sent anyone to pick it up! I’m getting charged by the day where my vehicle is. They’ve hung up on me, asked me personal questions they didn’t need to know, and are very unprofessional. Every time I’ve called to schedule a tow, they say it’s taken care of, but when I call back after they don’t show up, they have no record of me calling the previous time, or any of the times before that. Another time, when I locked my keys in my vehicle at a gas station, I was stranded for 4 1/2 hours. Absolutely do not go with this company!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!  My cat. converter was stolen out of my car.  Appraiser showed up with no jack.  He was unable to take photos for his report.  Took about a month for him to get around to it.  When I asked for some extra rental car coverage, due to this guy's slow response, they refused and tried to blame it on my mechanic.  CSE guy had the nerve to say the catalytic converter install should only take an hour, so the 3 days at the shop, and the extra rental days, is the mechanic's fault.  Really?  And how long should it take to take a photo and fill out an insurance report?  If I were the president of this company, I would have been so embarrassed by the appraiser's lack of preparation and slow behavior that I would have gladly paid for a few extra rental days.  Instead, goodbye to 2 home policies and an auto policy. Worst experience EVER with an insurance company.< /review>

I have been a CSE customer for a while, but I am very disappointed, and will find another company. I will present only the facts, and will leave it to the readers to figure out why I am so upset by CSE: on Saturday, 7/25/2020, I filed a claim. The claim agent, David Hernandez, contacted me on Monday, 7/27, and was responsive at that time. We agreed on a repair shop, and he started the procedure for issuing a check. There was about $1,000 difference between the shop’s estimate and CSE’s estimate, which I forgot about when I was talking to David Hernandez on Monday, 7/27. Therefore, I tried to get clarifications from David Hernandez (CSE) on Tuesday, 7/28, who will cover the difference. I was not getting a reply, so I decided to risk and deal with the estimate difference later. I contacted the shop on Tuesday, 7/28, to leave the car for repairs, but it turned out that the shop was very busy. Since I could not afford to be without a car for more than 3-4 days, I decided to use another shop. I found one, which had even a slightly better rating than the first one, and which agreed to repair my car in much more reasonable time. Unfortunately, this is my first claim, and I am not familiar with the process. I thought I had to get CSE’s permission to switch repair shops.  Therefore, between 4:10 p.m. and 4:21 p.m. on Tuesday, 7/28, I left an urgent voice mail, text message, and an e-mail to David Hernandez, CSE. I was not getting any reply, so on Wednesday, 7/29, in the morning, I tried to reach him again (please remember I was not familiar with the claim process, so I thought I had to obtain CSE’s approval to switch shops, and that I could be without car no longer than 3-4 days). I could talk to him only after I had to call CSE FOUR times (the two claim operators kept connecting me to David Hernandez’s line, even though I let them know, after the first time, that David Hernandez was not picking up his phone). Anyway, on Wednesday, 7/29, around 11:00 a.m., we spoke, and I requested switching the shops. Please note, the second shop has agreed to meet CSE estimate, while the first shop’s estimate was higher with approximately $1,000, AND the second shop committed to finish the repairs by the end of the day on Friday, 7/31, which means that I would have saved CSE money on rental car (I have the coverage). The only thing I requested in return from CSE was to expedite/overnight the check, so I could pay the shop on 7/31, and pick up my car. CSE refused to expedite the check, even though I was saving CSE about $1,000, and the costs for me renting a car for 6-7 days. When I shared my experience with CSE (they pretend to care about their customers, so I received a link to write them back), I received a call from a Kyle Norman, Claims Operations Manager. According to him, it was my fault for the check being delayed, since I requested to switch shops. Never mind that the second shop saves them a ton of money. What really upset me about this Kyle Norman was: a/ he tried to use ridiculous arguments to prove to me that  everything was my fault, for example he tried to convince me that even if they had overnighted the check, I would not have received it earlier (??? I still can’t believe that a reasonable person would say that); b/ he lied to me, again to prove to me that everything was my fault – David Hernandez said that CSE checks come from Walnut Creek, California, while Kyle Norman said the CSE checks come from the East Coast, and when the check finally came, it came from Wells Fargo in…Walnut Creek, California. If the Claims Operations Manager shows no flexibility, and on top of it – lies to customers, and acts according to the principle “I am right, and the client is wrong” by even using ridiculous arguments, then what could the customers expect from the regular claim adjusters?< /review>

<Review>Never buy insurance in CSE. If possible, I would rate it as minus. It is very hard to get reimbursed for your loss. They even think the wall holes cut by tenants and windows broken by tenants belong to normal wear or tenant abuse. They do not think the damage belong to vandalism. They said it is not vandalism if you did not see and prove the tenant cut the wall or broken the window. It is ridiculous. Their agents do not response your phone or emails either. My friends said their insurance has no problem to claim these kind of damage as vandalism. Very bad experience with CSE.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><user_id>116798716454402172569</user_id><GmapID>0x8085619759ff8759:0xae65b3fcdfd02e45< /GmapID>< date>

<Review>They double billed me and then when they sent the refund check for the over billing, the check bounced. I got a returned check fee because of it and they refused to refund the returned check fee.

RIP OFF, RIP OFF, RIP OFF!!! Unfortunately my agent provided insurance under this company. After being paying my premiums for several years, and taking the abusive 20% raise in premium every year, they decided not to renew my policy for reasons not explained. Received a letter from these crooks just a month before my policy expire. Not much time for shopping around. In other words, all these years this company has been stealing my money and then I ended up with no coverage!!!< /Review>

<response>None<//response><Text>CSE has the worst service and very slimy business practices - I happened to get in an accident and was aware of my rates going up which I accepted the amount I had to pay. Almost a year later, I looked at my mail and with no explanation they increased my rates by almost 100%. They recommend good rates to begin with but will eventually screw you over.

I'm surprised by the low reviews for CSE.  My experience with CSE for 20+ years - Auto, Home, Umbrella - has been highly favorable.  During that time we have had over 10 Auto claims (windshields, vehicle theft, 3rd party, our teenagers learning to drive) and 1 Home claim.  Every claim was handled expeditiously, fairly, and within the scope of the policy - both by CSE and the Agent.  Their rates appear competitive too.</review>

Dropped my coverage after about 7 years because my home is located on a hillside they deemed a fire hazard. I've never made a claim.</Review>

<UserId.>108146879029292504239</UserId.><Text>We are still waiting for a home insurance claim to be resolved. So far, CSE has been nothing less than horrible dealing with claims and non-responsive when you try to communicate with them. We had a water leak related damage to the kitchen in early January and they have not come back to us with a straight answer till now. Our kitchen is torn apart with electricity lines and nail bits on cement exposed while we’re waiting on them and with three young kids it is really impossible to keep them safe. Wish we didn’t even start a claim. We just want a quick resolution and they seem to be playing us by dragging their feet.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Current vehicle theft with them. They wanted to send some private investigator to my HOME on an evening or weekend for an interview. I asked them to provide the location instead since they have offices in Walnut Creek. They instead issued a “cooperation” letter even though I am perfectly happy to do the interview at any time, just not at my home, which CA dept. of Insurance informs me I am within my rights to demand (that it be at their location). Now they won’t let me have my car. And my adjuster refuses to provide me with an overview of the CAE procedures for settling a claim so that I know what to expect. I’d give them -5 stars if I could.

<review>Pending claim from 10/31/2017. They been giving me the run-around.. Had a concussion was taken to ER.. when I was rear-ended by one of their drivers.. my car was totaled so I have no car.. I'm stacked with a $13,000 dollar medical bill.. I have a baseball size bump in the back of my head.. both elbows have been extremely sore.. my jaw joints have been so painful and my bite changed because of the force of the impact and many other physical problems.. I was coming home Halloween day mindeing my own business.. sitting in a red light 5 miles from home when this Idiot rear-ended me  totaled my car physically and mentally changed my life and now they don't want to take responsibility for it.. They try to make it like it was my fault.. have been out of work, no car and my family have known the worst of me.. I'm always in a really bad mood.. Always in severe pain.. my head is not right.. just wanted someone to know in case I just can't take it anymore..
Thanks you Craig Prince(Driver)/ and thank you CSE Insurance and finally thank you Jeano Mitchell (Adjuster)..
Please if you read this post don't have any thing to do with this insurance..</review>< userid>

My truck blew a tire on the highway. $4500 damage.
They were easy to deal with,  There was hidden damage the body shop found, CSE immediately adjusted the amount and sent the check fast.
It's not about questionnaires,  it's about treating customers fairly and paying claims fast. People need to be able to move on after a loss.< /review>

My total loss claim was scheduled to be done well in the coverage timeline (16days). However, due to CSE's constant mistakes on my title document my rental coverage was surpassed. I had to pay  14 days for a rental out of my pocket because of their mistakes. I did everything possible to avoid these delays. They didn't want to compensate me for their mistakes.</Review>

Don't use this insurance company. They have never answer my call. They always have high volume of calls. I have waited over an hour and they are always busy. If they have short hands, they need to hire more people to support their high volume of customers and calls. Otherwise, they can't survive.<//Review>

I had to rent a car but it was my expense because by the time communication was complete I exceeded the maximum. 3. Sat on a desk for a  time. 3. Once the claim was resolved Adjuster was not competent at all and though I made repeated calls to a Supervisor NOT ONCE did she return the call. 4. If I could rate this company and employee with  minus one I would.</review></record>

< Review>
Extremely dissapointed.  I called to file a claim, as of today I cant get a hold of anyone regarding my claim, nevertheless the adjuster is non responsive to any of my call/ messages.  I call the 800 main line and no one seems to know anything.
This is the worse insurance I've ever had in life.
Dont waist your money and time with CSE.</Review>

Misty Mingle was the rep I talked to, she was beyond rude and was constantly yelling over the phone. She was making false claims while being oblivious to actual cost surrounding her field. When I tried to make a complaint about her I was treated with disrespect by the person on the phone. Over all if I could I would give this insurance a negative 2 stars at best. Worse insurace agency ive had buisness with.<//text>

Todd took great care of me. Got me a great deal on a set of cooper tires, answered all my questions, provided great service, quick work, and an all around excellent experience. Will be returning to get my brakes and other work done.< /text>

I made an appointment with Gus Mendoza for today. My car was immediately brought into the garage at the appointed time. I was able to watch Jonathan N. due a fabulous job through the window in the lounge area. He checked/added fluids checked my battery changed my synthetic oil in my Mustang GT. I couldn’t have asked or expected a better value or experience.
Thank you very much, great job!<//Review>

I took my vehicle in for oil change new oil filter air filter.I had a door handle that needed to be replaced.I had ordered my door handle ahead of time.The people are very helpful and nice.I took a walk around Pico Blvd.There was a beauty supply store.Lots of different types of restaurants to get a bite at.They were very. busy.Took a little more time than I expected.I would rather have the job done correctly the first time.Pep Boys does and will definitely have your car fixed property.
I trust Pep Boys for my vehicle.<//text>

<Review>Ive taking my truck here a few times for oil change. They been very helpful and friendly. Best value i can get for an oil change in the area without a doubt. Its best to make an apointment and wait, do some shopping at wholefoods or drop off your vehicle and pick it up later. They are very efficient and do a great job every time i've brought my vehicles here. I also got some great deals on a set of new tires and 2 - O2 sensors replaced with in 4 hours of dropping my suv off. It would be tough to find a better quality job for the price anywhere around, i've tried and won't go anywhere else unless I had to.</Review>< gmap_id>

My Honda Odyssey battery is coming to end of life. I went to Pep Boys at Santa Monica for replacement. I called the store in advance. Todd was so helpful and told me when I should be at the store. Everything was so smooth afterwards. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. Great service ! Ask for Todd next time.< /review>

As poppa always taught you, there are a few invaluable things in life that you just need to have.  One of them is an auto mechanic you trust (the other, oddly, was "just a little bit of that Elvis swagger").  I've been going to Ori's for over twelve years now, and never once regretted it.</text>

<Text>Was here today 7/29/20  9am pst. Got 2 new tires and realignment. They lost one of my (custom) tire caps and said they will pay me for a new set once I show the receipt.  I will update this to either a 5 star or 1 star depending on them keeping their word. Fast work and seemed good with friendly sociable staff. Got nothing against them just dont like losing things and not being told. we will see in the next week as I just put in the order for a new set.

Update 8/1/20 : went back and spoke with gus. Very helpful. They reimbursed me after showing proof that I had purchased a new set of tire caps. Will be coming back to this location as I do appreciate when customer service is on point.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I go to this Pep Boys for my tires, alignments, oil changes, etc. When I make an appointment for an oil change, they get me in and out quickly. When I have had issues with my tires, like when my indicator light came on today, they quickly got my car up on a rack, checked all my tires thoroughly and finding the issue was low air pressure, filled my tires and got me on the road quickly. I really appreciate the service these guys provide and highly recommend them.<//Review>< Rate>

< Review>
I was charged for work that never got done (got a partial refund), and over the week and a half they had my car they never once updated me on the status once I had called them on it.

I took my car in for, among other things, replacement of my washer fluid pump, which they said they could do.  They later called me with the overall cost which I accepted, and later called me to tell me all work was complete.  I went and paid, got my keys, and tried it out.  The washer fluid pump still didn't work.  All responsible parties had already left for the day, so the next week I come by and confirm - the work never happened.  But they'll keep the car and fix it.  Days go by in which I don't receive any updates, so I call.  No progress.  This happens for a week and a half, when after I have to call yet again, they tell me they can't do the work they charged me for.  But I can get a partial refund.  They then fail to tell me only one person can do refunds or when he'll be in, so when I pick up my car I still have no refund.  It takes another week and a half to handle that, and I still had to pay for some of the 'work' that never really happened.<//Review>

<Review>EDITED.  CHANGING TO FROM 2 TO 1 AFTER TRYING TO DO REBATE ONLINE AND FORM WONT ACCEPT NUMBERS.   Won’t be coming back here.  Seems like there is only one person there at all times but never the same person.  They never pick up the phone or call back like they said they would.  Made morning appointment for brake pads and check leaky tire.  Couldn’t get pads from store up the street till next day but didn’t tell me.  Asked them multiple times about the tire on phone, in person and on website appointment details and they acted like I never told them about it.< /Review>< Pictures>

Went in for an oil change they said my car needs a full synthetic that's what the manufacturer recommended they said, I said let me check the owner's manual, nowhere in that manual said full synthetic when I showed them. Also had the GM official site on my phone with all suggested oil for use from owners manual API. Then they told me they don't have any regular oil and they couldn't do oil change. Just a warning to everyone apparently this place only carries full synthetic oil so you can pay the full synthetic high prices.</Review>

<Review>My car did not start this morning so I had to get road assistance to jump start it. While they were coming, I called Pep Boys to ask about the battery replacement cost and details. I went there and J.P. was extremely helpful and so nice to me! After leaving, I called back with one follow up question from the gas station and he was just SO HELPFUL AND NICE TO ME!! Thank you so much.</Review>< gmap_id>

<text>I went in for a part and an oil change and was informed they couldn't work on my car because I didn't pass my smog test. I was trying to explain that this was the reason I came in. The employee then walked out on me in mid conversation. Very rude. I just wanted to understand why they couldn't work on my car.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>While on vacation, my boyfriend had ran over a screw just as we were about to go back home, so we looked up the nearest tire shop and this store was less than a mile from us so we decided to go there, despite the reviews. Biggest mistake. We got there around 2:30 and was told that it would be done around 4 because 2 cars were ahead of us. So we thought okay not bad, but this wait turned into 3.5 hours! We didn't leave until 6! The manager who initially help us was wonderful and very efficient, but I assume he left for the day and left us with super slow workers. There were even people who came after us that got their cars fixed before us. Not one of the employees came to us and gave us updates or an updated estimated wait time and did not get to our car until we literally reminded them that we were still waiting! Eventually when our tire was fixed, 3 hours later, we were not even notified that it was done. Again, we had to go up to them and ask if it was ready and it had been ready for like 15-20 minutes but they didn't think to tell us. The man who helped us was nice and all, but the wait time was absolutely ridiculous and the service was insufficient. Would not recommend if you are in a hurry, but if u want to wait around and be ignored all day, by all means, go to this store.<//review>< Name>

After changing my oil in this shop I discovered they changed my new battery too My car after one day start not working. The police helped me that day to charge  the battery I was in the school parking  lot and other day in the morning my car not working again  I call triple A when they came to charge my battery the guy  say you have to change  your battery because  this is the wrong  one you have in your  car. I was shocked and I asked my self to many questions why what happened My car when I bought the battery  from Costco  3 month ago was fine and everything  OK it's  working. I went to Costco and I take the battery from the car when I open the battery I found out  that The iron part that houses the battery has  disappeared 🤔I think that part maybe was fell by it self from the car . In Costco when the employee see the battery he said  this battery  not from us not from Costco  maybe  some one change  it for you. 😱I can't describe my feelings how and who I am just keep thinking  who did this to me. I am just visit  the oil change shop and the guy  there  he say you have to leave  the  car  for 2- 2.5 hours I said OK but if you finish before  that  time please  give me a call. I went  to the Virginia park after  2 hours I am returned back to the shop  and the guy  said  your  car is ready I was wondering  why he didn't call me but I was in Harry because  I have to pick up my kids.  So I am just ride my car. This was my experience with pop boys.  Oil change shop< /Text>

I bought four tires from this location over a year ago.  I was encouraged to buy the option to rotate and service the tires every few thousand miles So I did purchase that option.  In January 2016 one of the tires kept losing air so I knew there was nail and I will get a flat tire if don't take care of it so I took the car to them since I bought the tires from this location.  When I told them about the option I had purchased and that one tire must have nail they asked me to wait.  Two hours passed by and no news and my car was still parked in the parking space where I parked.  I went to the desk and asked them and they said they just put air and the tires are fine and my car has been ready.  But nobody told me my car was ready and I sat there for two hours.  I had asked for tire rotation and told them one tire had nail since it kept losing air so I asked them again to please rotate the tire and take the nail out so I won't get flat tire on the freeway and get in a car accident and get injured or die.  So, finally they rotated the tires and took the nail out.  Their service was really bad.  I live in Santa Monica and that is why i went to them.  But I should not go to this location again and I warned my family and friends not to go here.  I had two bad experiences when this place was Discount Tires and after Pep Boys bought it I thought their management and staff has changed so Pep Boys must be better, but no they are as bad as the old Discount Tires.  Very bad customer service and negligence!!!<//text>

<Text>I saw there is only two stars here but I got a flat tire and I think it may be the place like the one near me. This is my first time here and it must be the last time. I changed my tires but they do not go straight after I got it. I'm sure about there may more things to check but they've charged me and must give the car at end  of the day. So I believe they skip some steps and returned my car before they close. I saw the guy was gonna lift my car but his coworker just came and told him something. Then, the guy returned my car. WORST experience ever and they deserved 0 star. DO NOT GO THERE. FIND SOME OTHER PLACES PLEASE</Text>< Time>

<review>I made the mistake of getting my oil changed here. When I drove off the lot, my car quickly filled with the smell of burning oil. The engine was completely covered with it. When I drove back to find out what had happened, the mechanic eventually said that he had knocked over the funnel of oil but had not bothered to tell the manager or me. They offered me a discount on return service, but I'll never be back. Any confidence I've ever had in the Pep Boys name is gone.<//review>< rate>

Horrible service
I made an appointment for an oil change for 9am and when I showed up they told me it would take 1 to 1.5 hours. Are you kidding me.The oil change itself shouldn't take more then 20 mins. So why have a fancy appointment system if you still have to wait an hour to get your oil change even started.< /Review>

Said I would get a small installation discount but it wasn't much. After the inspection the guy forgets to sign it so it wasn't valid and I had to go back. The same guy wasn't at work so they made me wait another two days.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
I went here on two occasions. First was for a very slow leak in a tire. No nail, no visible hole location. They dunked the tire and could not find any bubbling. They soaped the tire and nothing... They didn’t know what to do except reseat the tire. They did so thinking it might be some pinhole leak in the tire seal. They did this by gunning up the rim and reseating the tire. Cost $25. Next day tire is flat. I was in another area so I had to take it to another shop where they found the pinhole leak in the tire and actually fixed it. Second visit. Just needed a tire rotation. Had an appointment at 11am but decided to go early (10:30am) to see if they had an open bay and just do what should only take 10-15min at most. I pull up and tell them I’m early to see if they can get me quickly. The guy says no they are full so I say “ok well I’ll come back at my appointment time” he say that I don’t want to do that because he double booked me and if I come back during my actual appointment time that I might wait longer. I say ok I’ll wait. For one whole hour I watch 4 guys move like 90year olds crossing the street. I swear if they went any slower they’d be going backward! No work ethic, no hustle, no pride, nothing.... They didn’t even try to look like they cared. The only real reason I went back this second time was because tire rotations are “free” from a financial obligation. Obviously not free from time spent..... Oh yeah I didn’t get out of there until 11:50! That’s right 1hr20min for something that actually only took then 10min to take care of.  It’s really sad to see people like this... If you don’t take pride in what you do, who will ever take pride in you?  Sad....

Side note: you don’t have to read this but as another example of their laziness.... I was waiting with this older Russian gentleman and he had been there before I got there, and he was getting pissed! He was getting new tires put on and the guy working on his car was probably the slowest guy in the shop. It was incredible how long it was taking this one guy to change these tires. I really felt bad for the customer because you can tell he had been waiting there a while. I was there 1hr20 and I left before the old guy but was finishing up as I drove away.< /Review>

Their pricing was too high and i found out later that they gave me a false examination telling me my ac blower was completely broken when it turned on the next day.

<review>They think women are stupid when it comes to car care.  They tried to tell me that things were wrong with my car that I knew wasn't the issue because AAA had just told me what my SMALL issue was. I went to Pep Boys because I needed to use my Pep Boys credit card because I had just paid my rent. BEWARE OF THIS LOCATION. THEY ARE NOT HONEST. BAD BUSINESS.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

First, I was told the battery needs replacing.  Then, I called to find out about the ETA of it getting fixed and  I was told that it is actually my Starter and Gasket Manifold needs to be replaced. After they performed the service, I called to find out the status (I didn't even get an e-mail or call if it was done) I was told my car is ready and it is fine (after calling the prior day to make sure everything was ok).  I drive off and I notice that my engine light came on.  So, I drive back and told the manager that my engine light came on and it was never on before.  They pull out a code that suggest a knock on the engine.  They tested the battery and alternator.  The manager says I need an alternator.  I wanted my local Pepboys to do it.  So, I drive home very nervous that my car might stop in the middle of the freeway due to the possibility of getting stalled again.  I go to my local Pepboys and replaced the alternator and I still get the code PO325 Knock sensor.  After spending almost a grand, my car has not been fixed!  Now, I wonder if they did the correct diagnostics.  I'm hesitant to come to this place again.< /Review>< user_id>

I called yesterday and ordered a bouquet for my girlfriend. I asked them to deliver in the afternoon, and they did! They delivered on time, as promised, and the picture that my girlfriend sent to me with the bouquet looked gorgeous! It was really what was on their website! I will definitely order and use them again! Highly recommended!</text>

I am visiting from out of town for the week. I picked up some flowers for a wonderful girl. I called them first to see if they had the flowers I was looking to purchase. Thank goodness they did! Other florists around told me the ones I was looking for were coming out of season. Some lovely people warmly greeted me. They had just gotten som peonies fresh in that morning. All I had to do was pick which ones I wanted. The florist behind the counter did a phenomenal work of art, adding some other elements as well as some Lilly's. I highly recommend going here for any of your florist needs!</Text>

They did exactly what I’d ask for at the last minute for my girlfriends birthday since I was out of town, they delivered it to her house very fast and quickly. It was affordable and made her whole day! I am in shock. Everyone turned me down except for this place and I am so grateful.
Thank you Dave!!! I will be back.<//text>

Jim Martin (owner) has been my florist of choice for over 20 years. Dave's is great. The flowers are fresh, arrangements are great, staff is awesome, and the delivery is on time.

<review>Went online from out fo town to send flowers to a friend.  Easy shopping and easy checkout.  Got a picture of the flowers today from my friend and they looked better then online.  Only thing is I never received an email confirmation of the order so I was a little nervous.  With everything going on these days, it was a simple process overall, and beautiful arrangement.< /review>< Pictures>

I was looking to make a succulent arrangement for a memorial service i was attending, and wasnt sure if they only had flowers.

Ordered this beautiful arrangement for my husband and kids through Teleflora and was fulfilled through Dave's!! Its absoulutley BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING! Dare I say better then what was puctured!! (Balloon wasn't included I added it)

The ONLY issue I had was NOT THE FAULT of this florists, I ordered this particular arrangement for the vase it was advertised on Teleflora's site in. Working with a floral company in the past I understand things like that are only available as long as the supplies last. However the same arrangement w/the vase is still being sold on Teleflora's site with no mention of the possibility of it coming in a different vase. Again none of this is the florist issue. After contacting Teleflora they are sending the correct vase from their warehouse.< /text>

<Review>“OMG! These flowers are so BEAUTIFUL!!!”   These were the words my friend used when she received the flowers I sent from Dave’s Flower Box last weekend (06/30).
I found Dave’s on the Internet and called from South Carolina.  The gentleman who took the call was so nice and understanding of why I was sending the flowers and how I wanted them to look.  He assured me he would send a really nice and unique arrangement.
My friend really loved the flowers and the photos she sent to me showed just how beautiful and exotic the flowers were. Thank you Dave’s Flower Box for bringing my friend some joy at a difficult time.</Review>< Pictures>

Jim was so kind and had wonderful suggestions for additional touches with my wedding decor. He clearly has a lot of experience working with flowers for weddings, and his attention to detail is delightfully amazing. The standard bouquets already in the store are great as well, and I will be stopping by regularly to treat myself to some floral arrangements for the house after my wedding weekend.< /Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I got a big bouquet of flowers for my birthday sent over from my family in Russia. It was delivered on time, which was nice. But while the arrangement must have once been pretty, the flowers looked wilted right away and barely lasted two days. The pink roses had grey, rotting petals on the inside and even asters and stargazer lilies which usually last a long time looked far from fresh. I sent a picture to my family to thank them (from the most flattering angle), and they were disappointed saying that they had ordered a much nicer bouquet online. It's a shame, because I'm sure my loved ones paid an arm and a leg from overseas for this online flower delivery.<//Text>< resp>

<Review>For my first experience with them, I called in with a last minute bouquet request, and gave them a price range. I let them talk me into keeping the slightly larger arrangement because they said it would work better. They tell me to wait a half an hour. I'm in a hurry, so I go down there after 15 minutes so I can leave the second they're done, and the bouquet is already waiting. It's gorgeous, and, all in all, very reasonably priced for how great it looks. Service was friendly, and I will definitely shop here again.< /Review></record>

<text>One of the main reasons you choose the option to have flowers delivered is for the recipient to be able to receive all the joy, and excitement that goes with receiving flowers at work .  It is pointless to deliver the flowers when the recipient is not there, and to have somebody else sign for them. You are taking away the point of having the flowers delivered. So,  the next time that someone tells you the person will be in to work at 12:30, how about you deliver the flowers when the person is AT WORK!...not 3 hours before they arrive to work. I'll give you 4 stars because the flowers were beautiful,  I picked them out. But not five stars because you suck on the delivery... which was around $20 in addition to the flowers, and she wasn't even that far away from the shop.</text><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80d954e4ccc55adb:0x9d6906113f858e13</gmap_id></record>

The most beautiful, sweetest smelling, longest lasting roses I've ever received.  This was last year and I keep telling my friend from Reno to call you directly when he orders flowers, but I think he still uses a wire service.  The roses from the other local florists don't hold a candle to ones I received from your shop.
I plan to call the service he uses to update their files. Maybe they will list you as the florist to use here in San Diego.  I hope so!<//text>

A wonderful experience!  I first used Dave's a long time ago to deliver flowers to my wife's work...and it was superb!  I've used other 'services'...such as, 'online' services...and was disappointed each time.  Dave's Flower Box's service is the best!!<//Text>

It's good. But it's also pretty expensive considering it's fast food. The thing I don't like about this place is my mobile orders are never on time, last week I waited at least 20-25 minutes longer than the time it was supposed to be ready & they should give u a little something extra if your orders over 20 minutes late. But they never do.< /Text>

Terrible place to get food. Good food,  but it takes literally forever. Stood in line 47 minutes till my food came out. Absolutely no system and then half the stuff was missing,  so that took another 10 minutes to get. Idk, just not the place to go if you're in a hurry 🙈</Review>

<review>Awful place to order. In busy time you have to wait about an hour after your pick up time. They don't prepare in order. Such a sturdiness. You have to wait for 20 min even your order ready because they don't pack individually. The employee always searches  every order instead giving one by one. In most busy time (6pm and 7pm) when they need most help 1 or 2 employees take 1 hour break. It seems they have awful management which doesn't care about efficiency and customer service.</review><resp>None<//resp>< username>

This restaurant did not prepare my order for 1.5 hours. And when the grubhub customer care agent contacted the restaurant, they said that they need to remake the order. It's just ridiculous to have guests waiting while your order takes 2 hrs to get to you. Wish there was an option for 0.25 stars.<//Text>

I celebrated my birthday yesterday in this delicious restaurant. happy to tell that we had a sensational evening and the venue was no doubt one of the reasons for that strong celebration. The stuff  collaborated in a gorgeous manner, the meals were delicious and my friends were very  cheerful. We shall definitely come back again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.< /text>

< Review>
Food always has horrible taste, honey shrimps - it’s just shrimp inside bread, it’s not sweet, it’s salty, and so oily. Actually other food taste different not like other restaurants. It’s something wrong with their kitchen. They need serious inspection. there are never several kinds of dishes in stock. I waited 20 minutes until cooked, as a result, the rice became cold. shrimps are not sweet and not cooked, vegetables are not prepared, raw and tough, mushrooms with chicken are underpopulated. the worst place, and it's not a village, it's San Francisco.<//Review>

Ordered online. It said it would be ready at 8. They took my name 3 times and when I asked how much longer, I was told they never got my ticket. Waited more than an hour freezing outside. When I got home, the magical ticket was in my bag. Won't be returning to this location.<//Text>

<text>Me and my co workers ordered food from Panda.
We went outside
to meet up with the delivery person
The text conversation went on and on,
but he/she never answered my calls.
WORSE THING. Our food was left on the STREET.
4 of us walked all over Kaiser  building
LYON Street, O Farrell St, and Geary not just once...
BUT 3-4X.. and didn't see our food.

$40 is not that big amount.. but come on.. at least be decent 😴😴😴
Haaaaaaaaaaaay.. you guys.. there goes the $40 and we're hungry

DOORDASH refused to refund
PANDA EXPRESS, I called over 10x
finally someone spoke to me and later said,.. "COME, GET YOUR MONEY"
Me: 😱😱😱 no!! Put my money back on my debit card..
Minutes later, she hung up on me 😅 gosh 😴

I really didn't care for the food at all. The meat didn't appear by consistency to be authentic. To say the least. I won't be going back there. Not to mention the customer service was horrific. They charged us for the silverware and napkins.< /review>

I came hear to San Francisco for the long weekend and in our second day we decided to come and eat some panda, well when we got our food it was all good until the chow mien was burned a little and smell and taste like burned...I went to tell the manager and then the manager said it wasn't burned and I told them to taste it and they did and he was acting like it was normal..well he gave us a plate of rice which we didn't ask for, we ask for a new plate at least but they didn't care so this place was really bad cause it seems they don't care about they're customers..we had to waste $40 of food for 8 people with all chow mien.. apparently other customers had complains but they didn't tell the manager.</Text>

<Text>It was a very horrible experience! Employees were arguing with each other. David was pounding his hand on the counter at another employee. Several food trays were empty. They ran out of plates so food was given in bowls. How dare you charge me for a plate but I'm only getting a bowl portion? Unacceptable. Hostile environment. Uncomfortable customer experience.</Text><Date>1561959582922< /Date>< rating>

Judging by the location I was kinda hesitant to visit. After walking around the area earlier, it was fine, so I decide to stop in. Food was fresh during my visit. I've actually eaten here 3 additional times since my first visit.

Each time Ive entered, cooks are always cooking to ensure fresh batches of meat and sides are on the steam table for purchase. Places isnt messy or trashy. Bottled drinks sitting by the register in ice needs to be colder, maybe refrigerated. Fountain drinks are fine. I spoke clearly and loud while placing my order during peak hours because this place can get loud. Had no problems during any of my visits, very pleased. Tasty!<//text>

Great service and food! If you get there near closing time, there is a good chance they may have ran out of some of the food you might want. So don't do that! But the food was still great! Lady was very nice</text>

One time they forgot to give me my fortune cookie so don't let that happen to you.

Their portion sizes are pretty fair. The staff are all nice people and the food tastes good.< /Review>

Chinese fast food, one notch up. Good, quick, ready when you get there. Staff are always visibly hard workers, pleasant and quick w/your order.<//Review>

I have never seen a dumber cast of people working at one place. Can’t read English can’t write. Can’t follow simple request. I can teach my dog to jump. Can’t teach these dumb MFers to add soy sauce and forks. So stupid.<//review>

The food is great but the place is very dirty. Well you should expect it from the area because it's full of  dirty homeless people and criminals. When you go I would recommend honey walnut shrimp and beef and broccoli.<//Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Understaffed. Food ran out and people were waiting so long. Burnt chow mein. No ice and they turn the fountain machine off when not in use, so the soda was warm when they turned it on for me. They really need staff in order to keep up with the amount of business they have. A block from The Fillmore so they get plenty of people. Your staff is stressed. They had an attitude but I can totally understand them because they're understaffed. I'm a fan of Panda Express, but this location really needs help. Good luck.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The online order didn’t go thru, and they made me wait for 20 mins figuring out there it went, and which the manager told me “We don’t have the order, go talk to DoorDash” in a very rude way which made me feel like I don’t deserve any of that particular managers attention.
After which the order came to my again, and I asked about it the second time, and the manager didn’t pay attention on me at all, after waiting for 10 minutes, I asked one of their employees to check the order, and they straight on just ignored me serving the people in the line. The worst experience at Panda Express.<//Review>

Waits vary if you are picking up a delivery order.  Sometimes the chicken teriyaki makes me get sick.  The egg rolls and shrimp are delicious.< /Review>

The ingredients they use is fresh and good. It's hot when you get it. I would order shrimp with fried rice and chow mein, It's not salty and not too much accent.</text>

I like the Panda Express concept and have gone to its locations many times.  Ordinarily I would give it higher than 3 stars.  But, in this instance, the staff was unfriendly.  So, for that reason, I was dissatisfied.  But, the food and facilities were otherwise good.  So, I give it 3 stars but only because the staff was unfriendly.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) We as Family vloggers have fallen in love with Panda Express. The food is super tasty. We have enjoyed time and time again. You can choose from noodles / fried rice with 1 or 2 or 3 side dishes. Too bad that you are not in Europe, I miss your food already. Definitely recommended to eat here for not too much money.

Wij als Familie vloggers zijn verliefd 😍 geworden op Panda Express. Het eten is super lekker. Keer op keer hebben wij genoten. Je kan kiezen uit bami/Nasi met 1 of 2 of 3 bijgerechten. Jammer dat jullie niet in Europa zitten, ik mis jullie eten nu al. Zeker een aanrader om hier te eten voor niet al teveel geld.</text>

(Translated by Google) Prepare delicious almost like everywhere else, but the portion is less than the standard, but the money you pay is the same. Two toilets, however allowed only in one, the second for workers. I go there all the time, just because you can park your car in safeway parking lots.

(Original)
Готовят вкусно практически как и везде, однако порция бывает меньше чем стандарт, но деньги платишь одинакова.  Два туалета, пускают однако только в один, второй для рабочих. Езжу туда постоянно, только потому что можно припарковать машину на паркинги safeway.</review>

(Translated by Google) A place where you can satisfy both taste and convenience at an affordable price. You can choose rice and side dishes to eat together. I recommend it.

<rating>3</rating><Text>(Translated by Google) It's one of the few places that opens later here in San Francisco. They have home delivery with Uber Eats. I ordered a combo of two half sides: fried rice and noodles + Peking beef, teriyaki chicken, and chicken with mushrooms. All for $ 12, a very large plate to share with another person. How do I give a fortune cookie?

Es de los pocos locales que abre hasta más tarde aquí en San Francisco. Tienen servicio a domicilio con Uber Eats. Pedí un combo de dos half sides: arroz frito y noodles + ternera Pekín, pollo teriyaki y pollo con champiñones. Todo por 12 dólares, plato muy abundante para compartir con otra persona.

(Translated by Google) You cannot speak more about this traditional oriental fast food chain; there it is fulfilled. Unfortunately the experience is spoiled by the people who gather around. Be careful, since in broad daylight there are gangs and dealers, who fortunately do not enter the place, but they do make the atmosphere thin.

(Original)
No se puede hablar más de esta tradicional cadena de fast food oriental; ahí se cumple. Desgraciadamente la experiencia se echa a perder por la gente que se junta alrededor. Tengan cuidado, ya que a plena luz del día hay pandillas y dealers, que afortunadamente no entran al lugar, pero sí hacen que se enrarezca el ambiente.<//text>
