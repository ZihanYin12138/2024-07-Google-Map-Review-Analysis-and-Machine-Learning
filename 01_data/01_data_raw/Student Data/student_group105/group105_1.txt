<text>Dr. Redford and the staff are amazing. I will never change dentists as long as he is around they are like family. Under his care you are not just a patient he truly cares about you. I refer any of my friends or anyone that asks for a good dentist and I was always scared of dentists before but he is truly a gentle giant.</text><rate>5<//rate>< Time>

The surgeon here named Eric Crum is the worst. Avoid him at all costs. He pulled all of my wisdom teeth on Friday February 16, 2018. I felt the bottom one, and he knew I felt it, and did not give me anymore numbing medication. He proceeded to pull the tooth out, until it was completely out. It literally felt like I was being shocked,/electrocuted. There was massive pain, due to the fact that the roots were being pulled out with the tooth. The pain I felt is indescribable. It was a very traumatic and painful experience. My boyfriend was waiting for me when I came out of the office. When we stepped out of the office I started crying immediately . I told my boyfriend about what I had just gone through and how I was treated. He was beyond upset. If I could I would give him negative stars. He should not do what he does. He has absolutely no compassion for others. And two spots in my mouth where I had lost teeth previously had slivers of teeth still in there. He cleaned those all out and removed the rementants of the teeth, so I thought. I pulled a piece of tooth out today with tweezers that he didn't, because it was stabbing me in the tounge. I decided to add some pictures. Thank you and the best of luck to you.

So I just thought I would post an update. I went out of town on vacation and ended up going to an Urgent Care in La Quinta, CA., due to severe pain from my dental procedure. I was prescribed a strong antibiotic and pain medication. We I returned home, I had a letter from the dental group waiting for me. I believe I was sent this letter due to the review I left. Good luck to all of those who choose this place.<//review>

The staff was very nice. And the doctor made what is usually a very traumatic experience for me almost pain free. Even the shots weren't as bad as others. I was very pleased with my treatment.<//review>

I used to have a dentist for more than 15 years in Fair Oaks. I was forced to move on due to the insurance practices. I found Redford's office through Delta website. And they accepted both of my insurance. I did my research before I tried to make an appointment. I have had pretty bad experience with dentists who accepted Delta HMO. I read all of reviews online and attempted to see the appearance of the offices and what kind of patients they had. So I tried it. I accepted what I saw at my first appointment which was cleaning. This is the only office that started with cleaning appointment first. I was kind of happy with that because that was what I wanted to see how it is.

Then they referred me to another office for root canals. I had doubt on even when I had experience with this kind of setup before. However, this is the only office that pointed out to the internal infection.

At the root canal place, it was busy. Everyone was busy in there. But the dentist who performed the root canals seem to very very proficient. My long time dentist did everything himself. Root canal took him a lot longer than this one. I was extremely happy with his work.

Thank you all for the job well done.< /Text>

<text>This dental office is hard to find and in back of the normal offices on the street. When you drive down scripps drive the numbers 79 aren't anywhere to be found.  When you try to talk to them they power talk over you so fast that you can't understand them and never get a chance to speak. I was running a few minutes late because of traffic when one of the front desk people called me on the phone and started chewing me out for not being there 15 minutes early to do paper work. After the phone call it took me 15 minutes to find their obscure location.  I was sternly informed that I was 17 minutes late and I would have to reschedule for 3 months in the future. I had already waited two months for this along with having driven down from my cabin in Tahoe to make the appointment.</text><Rating>1<//Rating>< resp>

I highly recommend Redford Smiles!!! Dr. Redford is such a great Dentist that goes above and beyond for his patients. I honestly have never encountered a Dr. With such a compassionate "bedside" manner. His whole staff is wonderful. I have been somebody who unfortunately had fears of going to dentist because of previous experiences with them. And when I found Redford smiles I had several consults at Dr. Cosmetic Dental offices. I need upper and lower implants as well as several extractions. I wanted not only a great price but a great Dentist that made me feel comfortable. I loved that there was no judgment for my situation. I was treated with nothing but care and Respect. You can definitely expect nothing but the best at Redford Smiles 😃<//Text>

<Review>Im only putting 1 star because I can't write a review without doing so. Aweful customer service. I can't rate the actual doctor as I didnt even go see him, but just the way I was treated on the phone changed my mind about going there. I called to ask a few questions about services since the website stated they took walk in and emergency visits. When I spoke to the woman who answered, she came across as if I was wasting her time. She stated that they dont take walk in's and Emergency visits were by appointment only. I asked for some estimated pricing as I dont currently have insurance and am paying cash, she gave them to me then told me I may want to find a different dentist that I could afford. I can't believe she would say that to me.<//Review>< user>

So I only went in for an evaluation, figuring it would be a lot of $ that would have to planned for. The Dr. said he could fix my tooth right there on the spot, for an amount which I thought was very doable / fair too. The Dr. was great, and too the point. All the secretaries were very friendly and professional as well. This place will definitely do my future dental work.<//Review>

<text>I only went to them for three months because they stopped taking the kind of insurance that I have, but the time that I was with them, I really liked them. They were honest & upfront with treatment options and costs for what I needed done  - and also their prices were very reasonable in comparison with other dental offices in the area. Dr. Redford's work was well done, and his staff followed up properly with my insurance company so that everything was appropriately covered. Also, his receptionist was kind & helpful. Again, I was only with them for a short time, but had a very nice impression of them & would have continued with them if they still accepted my insurance. Anyway, I just wanted to express my gratitude to you all with this review...Thank you, Dr. Redford & staff. I hope you all had a very Merry Christmas - and Best Wishes to you all for the coming new year.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I had an emergency and needed to be seen ASAP.  DR. Redford's staff worked to get me in same day. Had to have an extraction. I have to say I have never felt more comfortable in a dentist chair EVER!  Coming from a dental background, I have seen alot if different situations.  Dr. Redford was amazing! His kindness and gentle nature put me at ease immediately! His staff smiles, are kind yet very professional.  I cant wait for my next appointment !! BTW, If I could give 10 stars, I would! Best experience ever. THANK YOU Dr Redford and staff!!< /review>

<review>As much as I hate going to the Dentist, I Love this dentist office. Receptionist is friendly and great customer service. Today, Olga the dental hygienist examined my teeth and gave me a cleaning. Can’t say enough about her gentle and very thorough examination and cleaning. Dr. Redford was called over for a closer look at a problem tooth. He is so friendly and comforting. Glad to be a patient of this office.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

This was the best dental experience I’ve had!  I did wait 45 minutes to be seen, however, the caring, compassionate manner of everyone in the office was exceptional and completely negates any waiting time. I have an irrational fear of dental work. Dr Redford was so kind, gentle and understanding.  He made sure I was comfortable and thoroughly explained the procedure. The office was clean.< /Review>

I love Dr. Redford & his employees! Everyone is so friendly! They do a great job. Dr. Redford takes time to discuss things & he really listens. He knows what he's doing. He tells you what's he's going to do & what he's doing as he's working. He always asks if you are ok or if he's hurting you. He's calm & relaxed, not uptight. Everyone is so nice. They all  know what they are doing & they work well together. I would want to work there if I was in the dental line of work. This is the best dental office I have ever been too. The whole team is awesome!<//Review>

I was referred there for a Root Canal and Crown and it was painless. They also do same day Crown which I love, but though I wasn't able to get mines done same day because of my situation with me grinding my teeth at night, so Dr Redford suggested I have it sent to the lab so that my crowns would last me longer, so I did. I will recommend this place to my friends and family and will also be switching myself and my kids over too.</review>< pics>

Honestly the best dentist in the world.  I typically HATE going to the dentist and get sooo scared and anxious but everyone at Redford Smiles makes my visits feel safe and comfortable.  They are patient and thorough and do an awesome job. HIGHLY recommend.  I’m an adult but definitely wish I would have been able to go to this dentist as a child.</Review>

I have not been to the office on Scripps Drive and was pleasantly surprised. The office is large and we'll staffed. The dental hygienist was thorough but careful. Dr Redford checked my teeth quickly though I was only scheduled for cleaning.  Overall experience was great.< /Text>

<Name>Michelle Wallace<//Name><Resp>None</Resp><text>Dr. Redford took me in as a patient when I was in a lot of pain.  Because of the covid19, nobody was available for a consult to find out why I was hurting.  I had an appointment the next day and the staff took xrays to see what the problem was.  I was informed that I needed an oral surgeon and was scheduled for an appointment within a few days.  I highly recommend Redford Smiles.  The friendly staff was wonderful and so was Dr. Redford. I would like to say that I have tried to get an appointment with my primary dentist for over a year with no response from them.  Thank you Dr. Redford and your staff for being so wonderful and caring. I would recommend Redford Smiles to anyone who needs a dentist. I give them 10 stars out of 5</text>< rating>

{'time': 1593557443393, 'text': "Hello Craig,\nI am so sorry that you have had such a difficult time. We always try our best to help with Medi Cal patients.  We are one of the largest offices that they have.  I would like you to understand that we see a lot of patients in one day as we try our best to accommodate all of them. So the phone rings a lot.  If you leave a message someone will call you back. No one was ignoring your calls at all.  It's not the way we do business.  We take care of the patients that are in front of us first.\nAs for you referral, this is all your Insurance.  Often times with Medi Cal you have to abide by their rules. With specialty there is only  a 14 day window to get your service  completed. Please call me tomorrow at the office and I will handle your appointment myself if you would like.  I really want you to get your treatment completed.  If you decide to go with another provider or us it's fine as long as your treated.  I will be in office all day tomorrow/   Kindly,\nMaignon"}<//resp>

<user>117197479805949953413<//user><Text>I tried scheduling an emergency referral appointment with this office and was disappointed at the lack of help the front office provided. I was informed that I needed to extend my referral expiration date since they are booked for a couple weeks. After extending my referral expiration date with my provider, I called back and I was giving another excuse saying they don't work with referral extension. At one point during all of this, my calls were being ignore and I had to call from a different number.  When I called from a different number, my call was answered right away and as soon as I asked about scheduling an emergency referral, the front office staff knew who I was and said they can not schedule my emergency referral even after asking for an extension. Honestly if you don't want to schedule someone with Medi-cal just say it instead of making up excuses after excuses.  If I can give a rate of 0 I would.</Text>< date>

<Review>First of all Redford Smiles is Just Awesome..The Staff is always polite, accommodating and professional. Dr..Redford is incredible...I know first hand he has an extremely busy schedule but is always relaxed, funny..professional and makes it a point to put you at ease. I had a problem with my invisalign braces and he he caught it right off and rectified the problem immediately..That being said there is no question how much I would recommend Redford Smiles..for any of your Dental Care needs..Top Notch..I'll never go anywhere else for my Dental Care..<//Review>< pics>

<resp>{'time': 1598900958095, 'text': 'Hi,  We would never schedule an appointment without a Dr being in the office as that would be pointless knowing that you were scheduled to see a DR. I am so sorry that you are not happy with the office any more and it sounds like you would be better suited to find a dentist that you feel you can trust and be comfortable with. When a patient complains to their Insurance Company we share all records that are requested and they make the determination of what we need to fix. As for your missed appointments they saw those on your records. I didn\'t "tell"them anything.\nAgain,  we strive to give the best care ad we are so sorry that your experience here is not a good one.  I will make sure to cancel your appointment and you can call your Insurance Company  for Assistance in finding another dentist.

They have a great surgeon...They were all nice and it seemed like they cared. Until they messed up some work and its been almost 2 years later and I'm still trying to be seen. Often times they would schedule me when the dr wasn't there.? Why in the world would they schedule someone when the dr wasn't in the office.  After waiting a month for an app the day before tell me I need to reschedule, that there is nothing they can do. All to wait another month for an app. So here I am a patient with this dr and I'm waiting more than 2 years for them to fix a small problem. Which shows that I'm not important to their business. They had the audacity to tell my insurance that I missed the appointment. There is just not a high expectation to fix mistakes and take responsibility from this office. My next appointment with them isn't until October 2020. So here we are again with the cycle of trying to get this fixed. But I'm paying the price and waiting again. of course no action against the dr office will be taken. Bcuz I missed the app. Had noting to do with them repeatedly scheduling me when the dr was out of the office. Just a heads up for those who want to know what they will have to deal with. Its sad and pathetic that paitents on the lower end of insurance get treated this way. Thanks dr. Redford and staff for the lesson learning experience i have had with your office. See you in October.< /text><Rate>1<//Rate>< Name>

I had 2 emergency appointments with them in the last week and not only did I get in immediately, I was treated with kindness, respect and understanding. Dr. Crum was amazing at my initial visit; even helping out with an insurance issue. Dr. Redford is so caring that he is available on weekends via text message. During my procedure, the amazing dental assistant kept me calm and breathing; and when I came back, she remembered me and showed me so much compassion. This practice is amazing. I've only been there twice and I could go on for a while about how great my all-around experience was. Thank you, Redford Smiles!</Text>

I am a returning client. I appreciate the quality of the care I receive and the human kindness. During this COVID 19 experience, I thought the office staff and the dental hygenist were all concerned about safety and protocol. The dental hygenist who took care of me was knowledgeable and competent.  She shared some cool advice to help with my teeth sensitivities,  first time I have heard this. Much appreciated.</review>

It was amazing. I went for a dreaded root canal. The words makes people cringe. But Dr. Redman had me numb in 5 minutes and the actual procedure took about 15 minutes and I never felt a thing!  It took me longer to drive to the office. Also I have been checked on to make sure everything is/will heal well.
Also the receptionist and the dental assistant were nice and very helpful!  One of the best dental experiences I’ve ever had🤗.</review>

What a wonderful experience.  Dr. Redford clearly wants the best for his patients.  Now, if I had the money for the expensive treatment that would be best for my situation, I would be in heaven.  The staff was most helpful and friendly.  If  you need a dentist, Dr. Redford is your go-to guy!</Text>

It is tough to understand sometimes that with your type of Insurance that our office and specialist have a lot of patients to see and to care for each with their own unique issues.

It's one the of worse place I have ever seen, my appointment was at 10AM and I was seen by by 1pm this is not a joke. They keep telling sorry, and I was not the only person the room was full all customers were so angry.
When I went couple times to counter and I was mad on them, so then they told me to come in and took me to the room and I set in there for another 40 minutes. I had 2 wisdom tooth to be removed and they even gave those shots for on both sides but when the doctor came in and saw it's more work to do he changed the story and said ohh we will one of them this time since the other need more attention we will see it next time it was the time I couldn't even talk. It was a nightmare  and this happened on 12/19/19.
Shame on such a poor dental office.<//Text>

I came to this dental office for some work on my teeth and had a very pleasant experience. It is a nice office with professional and polite staff. Dr Semeryuk did an amazing job in a short amount of time. He was easy to talk to and did a thorough painless job! I would recommend this office for any dental needs.<//Text>

<Text>Dr Redford is a stand up guy! I was at Scripps dental before he came along. The place had a whole new energy accompanied with great tunes (music) and just a all around positive energy. My teeth are horrible since I was young I've been to many dentists that I have raised an eyebrow too. But Dr Redford and the office sat and made a plan with me and also found me the best prices and worked with me. I do have medi-cal and they really went to bat for me finding me the best prices and working with me. I recently lost my dad to cancer and finally made an appointment to get this ball rolling Again. Thank you Redford smiles looking forward to seeing you guys again! I would highly recommend!< /Text><time>1596641295539< /time></record></dataset><record>

I went in for a composite filling today and had the best experience I’ve ever had with a dentist. Everything went well from beginning to end. Dr. Redford was gentle and caused me no pain. I was nervous to get numbed but actually felt no pain whatsoever. Overall, great experience and highly recommend.</Text>

<Name>Carina Bek</Name><text>Redford Smiles is the best dental office I have ever been to. The staff is so welcoming and helpful. Dr. Redford truly cares about you as a patient. Every single encounter with him has been pleasant. He jokes around & makes you laugh to lighten up the dental experience. I trust Dr. Redford with any procedure he recommends because over the course of a year I have had so many visits to his office and they have all been SUCCESSFUL. The front desk ladies where always working hard with my insurance to get me in as soon as possible. All of my appointments where no more than 2 weeks apart and that is hard to get with dental offices. I got my wisdom teeth pulled at Redford smiles & the healing process went smoothly. I also got an infection under my root canal which was really scary because I had a blister on my gums. My insurance didn’t cover the procedure and I was moving to a different state & I was terrified. Dr. Mark Redford is an angel sent from heaven. He did the procedure for me nonetheless & saved my tooth. A week after the procedure & following the instructions Dr gave me about taking antibiotics my blister was completely gone. I feel so safe being cared for by Dr.Redford. He truly cares about you as a patient and will do his very best AND MORE to help you. My experience was exceptional. Thank you so much Dr and all of your lovely staff.< /text><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

I recommend Redford Smiles to anyone that is afraid of the dentist.  The staff there is GREAT made me feel very comfortable.  Dr Eric Crum was very concerned that i was comfortable and that the pain was minimal.  It hurt i won't lie but it could have been worse.  Thank you all LADIES and GENT.  Hope to see you guys on different terms, but greatly appreciated being seen by you all!!!!<//Review>

They do not overbook (at least from what I've experienced) where you are actually seen near your appointment time. My girls are so comfortable I was literally kicked out by my 4yr old and told to wait in the waiting room. The girls were next to each other and you could hear them talking and having a good time while of course getting their teeth brushed! Only thing I wish was they were open later</text>< pics>

<Text>Dr Redford said I needed 3 root canals and 7 cavities. I got a second opinions and all the other places I went to said that was NOT the case. In fact I only needed to have 3 cavities filled and I was done. This guy is money hungry and will tell you you need a bunch of work you really don’t.

Also he tried to sell me adult braces for 4K and Veneers for another 6+k. It was a sales pitch not a dentist appt.

During the cleaning they did not measure my gums, scrape my teeth for plaque or even give me a cancer screening.. just polished and flossed which I do at home myself perfectly fine.

Don’t waste your time or money!!!</Text>< pictures>

Please understand that it is a Dr's duty to give you all the options for what you may need and can have.  You are never under any obligation to do anything you don't want to. Dr's have different opinions of what is needed.  At this office we tell you what you may need and complete lifetime dentistry for you.  We do not patch teeth for short term success. I am confused about a couple of your concerns and as we have different notes then what your expressing. If you want to call and discuss I would be more than happy to assist you.

Fraudulent billing trying to get Medi-cal patients to pay for services by claiming they couldn't get authorization from Ins. But I spoke with Medi-cal and was told services had been paid (UNDER AN ENCOUNTER CLAIM and auth IS NOT NEEDED)....not a lot since it is Medi-cal...but, why is that my fault.
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL!
I knew something was off when NO ONE would give me a paper bill with charges. When I demanded to speak with the Dr.  We were fired as patients...an entire Family
DEMAND BILLING IN WRITING BEFORE PAYING$$$ ANYTHING!!!!
Last seen by this office a year ago NONE of Redfords diagnosis are accurate according to my new Dentist.
Have Medi-cal go somewhere else!<//text>

I just switched to this dentist through my insurance. I've read reviews on other offices and this place has the most good and positive reviews. I read one bad review but notice the dentist quickly responded professionally and I'm pretty impressed. Going to set an appointment soon and hope all goes well. Will return for an update.< /review>

Very clean and professional office. Dr. Redford's staff was knowledgeable,easy to interact with, and very attentive to the patients needs. Everyone made you as the patient comfortable. Dr. Redford and his multicultural staff were very professional and conducted themselves with confidence. I did have to wait 2 hours after my appointment to actually be seen by the Dentist but it was worth it. He went straight to work pulling two teeth that needed attention badly. Very little discomfort and is healing as it should. Thanks a mouthful Dr. Redford.< /Review>

I went here cause my dentist didn’t have a until the 27th to take out my tooth I called them and told me they had an opening for the next day I just need my insurance to send them the referral and once I did. I called them and they sent up the appointment. I went the day at 7 am to get my tooth out and Dr.Crum came in he was really nice put some numb medicine waited for it to kick in and then pulled the tooth out it was so quickly. I am glad that I went with them</review>

Today was my first visit but it seem as if I've known the doctor and staff forever. I wanted to find the dentist office that I can call home and that's exactly how I felt on my very first visit  The doctor and staff was very attentive to my medical and financial needs . Thank you, I look forward to going to the dentist again< /Review>

Scripps Dental Group was amazing and working with my schedule.  I only had a few weeks to get work done before my dental insurance was gone and they took care of things quickly and handled the most pressing issues first.  The staff is very friendly and willing to help in any way possible.  ﻿

Despite what everyone say I believe they write reviews when they are angry and forgot how this place has help them. People forget what pain you can feel after any procedure which is normal and can happen to anyone. At first I was angry because my filling that was done became very sensitive and painful. I started to get a bubble like form. I understand that being fitted into the schedule and being assign to a HIGH list of HMO patients there is going to be a wait. The receptionist clearly told me over the phone and did check up on me. Dr. Redford let me know that yes, there will be cases where this can happen . He fully explained everything. You just have to make sure you actually have a doctor that care for you. The staff has always been great to me. At first I thought that they were not trying to help me and after my their visit I realize how friendly and helping they are. It just seems that when you are in a bad mood, you forget  how much people help you. It's not their job to make sure you brush your teeth. It's not their job to know know why your claims got denied. It's only their job to make sure you are getting the treatment that is best for you. Thank you Redford Smiles. I hope that people do come here because you have a great team here and you are willing to help patients like me who has little to no money and has medi-cal was an insurance. None of my visit have you made me feel less important. Thank you all.</text>

Redford Smiles is true customer service. Dr. was friendly, the lady who took x-rays was talking and making jokes (she's hilarious), the lady at the desk worked with me to make a filling appointment and my next check up.

Came here with my mom to get her tooth pulled. The girls in the front where very nice and helpful. Besides the wait of figuring out the paperwork  confusing between my moms dr and dentist and the hour that she had to wait after she took the medication she was taken back very fast. Didn’t have to wait long for the tall and handsome dr to come. All of the staff was very nice, informational and professional. I was definitely pleased. Thank u for such a great and fast work done on my mom.<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Terrible customer service. First day was great. Doctor was friendly and talked a good gameplan. It has been over 6 weeks and after 5 calls I have still not received the treatment plan they promised on March 22nd. They shoved an iPad in my face pushing me to give them a positive review while still in their office day 1 which was really odd. Very bad at returning calls and I ended up switching to Diamond Dental which has way better pricing, customer service and care about their patients. Redford Smiles gets a Redford frown and lost a customer for life. Special notes for Lupe and Emily who lied to me. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. 1 star is generous!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1557940814608, 'text': "Hi Toney,  I apologize that your experience was not good with the front staff.

<review>This is the worst place ever.

The oral surgeon and dental assistants were verbally very rude and insensitive.

The dental assistant held my arms down while the rude oral surgeon pulled my teeth.

I overheard one of the dental workers say she put a patient's xray in the wrong patient's file.

The dental assistant almost had the wrong
tooth pulled out of my mouth.

Thanks for PTSD and an increase in anxiety!! 😡< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1563983923571, 'text': 'I am sorry that this was so stressful for you. I understand that having extractions is very unnerving. We see lots of patients in our office due to the type of Insurance that you have. So there is a lot of assistants talking about a lot of things. But I can assure you that the Oral Surgeon would not have pulled the wrong tooth.  As for holding your arms down , Assistants sometimes have to keep patients hands away from their face when the Dr is working so that the patient does not hurt themselves.  They deal with sharp instruments and needles.  I hope your all better now.   Kindly,\n\nmaignon'}<//Resp>

Went in for a molar extraction. I’d never had a tooth removed before and was extremely nervous. Dr. Redford and his assistant assured me that it would be quick and easy once the novocaine kicked in. I was done in less than 5 minutes and had no pain after the the novocaine wore off. Just soreness around the gum.</Text>

Scheduled appt. for cleaning and x-rays which is covered at 100% but no they found a way to make it so I can't get my cleaning. Dr. said I had periodontal and could not do a regular cleaning. I hate to burst your bubble Dr. Redford but 47.2 percent, or 64.7 million American adults have periodontal and if you want to stay in business you should just perform the regular cleaning instead of trying to screw over your patients and refusing to do a regular cleaning and insisting on the deep cleaning. So I just left! He's not going to make any money off of me, he had the opportunity to collect from my insurance for a cleaning, x-ray, and consultation but now I'm considering filing a grievance so he gets nothing. Pathetic how greedy some of these people are! All they want is to take your money and don't care about your health.<//text>

Worst staff ever. Front desk is beyond rude and hung up on me for no reason... was no argument or raised voice and whoever picked up the phone was extremely rude for no reason and hung up on me for no apparent reason . Wouldn't recommend anyone to go there and if you do good luck with the front staff. They lost a Cash patient, happy I never got to actually make an appointment.<//Review>

I love how they are so willing to help you and go over everything with you so that you understand. Emily was great. Walked in and was greeted with a smile. I just know it was her on the phone scheduling me as alive as she was. Lupe was great at helping me understand my treatment of having a deep cleaning. I would defintely reccomend this place. Maria was nice enough to help me schedule my four months appointment. Again this place is defintely a great place.</Review>< user>

<text>Took my son here for the first time and it took them about an hour and a half before they call for us. People who came after were being seen before us. Our appointment was before there's too. I felt we were rushed in and out. Took forever to be seen, but when we were called in we were out in seconds.<//text>< Pics>

The staff that work there, pushes you to make exonerous expenses and tells you lies just to take you more money. I had as well as my wife several big problems with this firm and explaining what happened would be too long to explain. We had to file a complaint with the insurance dental eatna, against this firm that lied to us and rob!
I advise you not to go into this dental office, which is not honest and pushes you to consume. The staff is not friendly at all<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Ok, Ive been going here for years and at one point considered finding a new place, but WOW they have really listened to their patients comments and did a complete overhaul. I now wait no more than 4-5 minutes after I arrive to get called back to see the dental assistant, hygienist and/or dentist. They all have positive demeanors and seem happy as clams to be working at Scripps Dental Group. They have upgraded to this cool technology so you can see your x-rays appear in real time right in front of you so you can see your results asap. Today I was in for a routine cleaning/x-rays/check up and had a small cavity filled all in under 45 minutes. Um, ok SO glad me and my family stuck with this place. Super friendly staff who are attentive AND get things done in a timely / super quick manner. Keep up the great work Scripps I'll be referring people over.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

They are slow and very disrespectful,  the lady at the front window gave my dad attitude when he asked how much longer after sitting here for an hour. They let people that just walked in go before me, I over heard someone's apt. Time and it was after mine they still let her go. DONT COME HERE<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Time>1454951711288</Time><rating>1</rating><Text>Save your time and your money before you go to this place. I am now seeking legal advice on my orthodontics situation...I will start with the amount of time that you lose at this place...expect at least a 40 minute wait just to be seen. Do NOT I repeat DO NOT get your braces done here. I have been here for a year and a half and we are now getting our 3rd "New" orthodontist...yes that means constantly changing up what they are doing to my teeth. Canceling my appointments and rescheduling them an additional 2-3 weeks is a normal practice at Scripps. So if you expect to see your orthodontist in a normal timeframe like 4 weeks, good luck! On average it takes anywhere from 6-8 weeks to be seen at Scripps. I find it odd that all my friends get seen by their orthodontist once a month and Scripps Dental just doesn't have the time to fit you in. Recently I decided to investigate my situation and call my insurance, turns out Scripps has not reported to my insurance that I have orthodontic work being done...which means I am paying more out of pocket! I highly recommend going elsewhere and if you do decide to go there and have the extra time to waste, at least follow up with your insurance company and get a copy of all work done on your teeth so that you may cover yourself if something is to arise.<//Text>< Pics>

It's hard to understand how the Community Manager I work with at my property (not to mention his VP) manages to keep a job. These guys almost never respond to emails and phone calls. In the rare instances when they do respond, it's just an obligatory response but it never leads to substantive feedback or resolution of issues. I've had times where I've followed up three, four, five times and there's no response. I pay my $400 bill to First Service on the first of every month... always on time, never late... yet the people with the words "community manager" in their titles don't bother to respond to members of the community. This is in a time where many of the amenities I'm paying for haven't been accessible for the last year (pool, jacuzzi, sauna, gym). Quite the business model this company has going for itself. This place has an average rating of 2.3 as of this message, which is awful (and predictable), but it's shocking to me that it's that high.

[UPDATE: After speaking with Terri a couple of times, I am optimistic that my concerns have been heard and positive change is coming. Based on that, I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 3 stars based on the professionalism, understanding, and commitment to improvement showed by Terri in dealing with my concerns.]<//Text>

This place is a joke no one calls you back you can send emails you can try to call them you can leave voicemails and none of them will help you in fact the only person that calls back as a person by the name of Kevin who it’s not even his job I have now dealt with Ashley,Terri, Tiffany, Bradley ,& Kevin. The only people who reply or the guys not sure what’s going on but the girls just don’t know how to pick up the phone or don’t want to talk on the phone.</text>

The people on the phone for the most part are nice, but you pretty much get the run around for everything. I’m always told someone will get back to me. The manager will contact you. We will add it to the notes.  Days go by and nothing! When you call them, it’s all new to them and no one has the same answer. They’re all just very confused and don’t help get anything done</text>

Johnny Mercado makes living at La Boheme an amazing experience. He is not only always available to help with any issues that come up, but consistently delivers above and beyond his normal duties. I'm always happy to walk by his office because I know he'll have something nice to say or an interesting story that will brighten my day. The work he puts into organizing events shows because they're always amazing and make living here feel like a tight-knit community< /review>

Johnny Mercado is not only the property manager at my condo complex, but also someone who has become a good friend. I can’t express how grateful I am for him, he’s has made my transition to California so easy — I truly feel like I can turn to him whenever I need something. Johnny pays so much attention to detail, he is incredibly good at his job and the building is a direct reflection of that. Super grateful for him and so happy to call La Boheme home 😌<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I've read some pretty scathing reviews about FSR but personally have only ever had extremely positive interactions with them. Amber and Emily at ICON in San Diego have done an amazing job keeping our community running as smoothly as possible. Our community, like many others, has a few hick-ups every now and then, but Emily and Amber have always been professional, responsive, and very communicative. I know they truly care about our residents, the building, and do everything within their power to ensure a safe and comfortable living environment for everyone. FSR as a whole has only ever provided excellent customer service with my billing inquiries and other minor questions I've had over the past 7 years working with them. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the company, especially Amber and Emily, and am thankful to have them supporting my community!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>Love having Johnny run La Boheme! He does everything possible to make this feel like a family community especially during the challenging COVID situation. We've had multiple Virtual Bingo nights with local restaurants offering special deals that help us connect and stay sane.  All issues are handled quickly and professionally.

We have had the unfortunate experience of having to work with FirstService handling our HOA in Rancho Mission Viejo. They have no problem taking our monthly dues, yet if you ever need assistance- good luck. I’m not sure who they have answering the phones and providing customer service but the bar must be pretty low because they are unhelpful and appear to have no idea what they are doing. I would avoid living in a community managed by FirstService if possible. Otherwise, they will cause multiple headaches.<//Review>

We  have owned our condo at La Boheme in San Diego for nine years. There were two other property managers before Johnny Mercado of First Service Residential took over. Johnny has made all the difference to us. He always responds cheerfully and quickly to any requests or problems. The maintenance staff is also friendly and efficient. They keep our property clean and in tip-top shape. Occasionally some residents go beyond the rules of good behavior, but Johnny tactfully handles the situation and bring them back into the fold.. He promotes a good feeling about living at La Boheme. We have nothing but  praise for Johnny Mercado of First Service Residential, and hope he stays with us forever.< /text>

<Review>Johnny Mercado is someone that other property managers should learn one or two or three....things from. He is the reason why The La Boheme is not just a condo building, it's a COMMUNITY. He has kept the building in the best shape and made La Boheme  the envy of North Park. He has excellent communication skills and he take the time to know the residents and the tenants.  Thank you Johnny for all you do.</Review>< pictures>

This property management company is the worst management company in the 15 years I've lived in the community.   The PM, Eric Kaluger does not return phone calls, respond to emails or resolve issues.  Notice to homeowners of major events (water main shut off, tree trimming, etc.) are sporadic if at all.< /Text>

I bought a condo at La Boheme in San Diego in 2018.  Since moving in, our building manager has been a huge part of what I love about living here.  He was very friendly and welcoming and gave clear instructions regarding all move in policies, etc.   He also invited me to the end of summer community BBQ the HOA was hosting!  He sends out consistent communication, keeping us updated on all projects going on and any issues.  The HOA also has a social committee and plans events every other month.  In 2020, all events were virtual, but we had virtual Bingo, DJ dance parties, and even an Ugly Sweater contest with raffle prizes...all on zoom.  I love my community!!<//Review>

<text>In case anyone is wondering why so many reviews all of a sudden, Johnny asked us if we wouldn't mind posting one. He asked us to be honest and put a negative one if that's how we felt. Well, I'm happily jumping on the Johnny Mercado positive review bandwagon! He warmly welcomed us in as new residence of La Boheme 3 years ago and has been amazing ever since. He sincerely wants everyone to enjoy themselves and brings us together as often as possible with BBQ's (including tasty margaritas and prizes),ski trips, as well as community volunteer opportunities like neighborhood trash clean ups and feeding the homeless. On the serious side, he always makes time for me and any concerns I have. He even answered the phone when my guy called him on Christmas- wow! There's always a lot going on here, and he has handled some crazy situations with professional grace. He has helped us feel safe during Covid Times by posting safety measures and sending emails to update changes. Like someone else mentioned also, the rest of the staff are pleasant and hard working. I hope they all stick around as long as I'm here! Thanks Team La Boheme!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Do not buy a property that is managed by FirstService Residential. Another commenter mentioned that will create a toxic environment for your community. I can confirm this is 100% accurate. HOAs have a bad reputation because of the negligence of companies like FirstService Residential. They will not respond to your emails or calls for important information about events like repiping. We have been left in the dark for several months about whether or not the repiping work would be billed back to us or handled by the association. This should have been clearly communicated by the property management team from day one. At the very least, our repeated emails and calls should have been answered.

Unfortunately things get worse. The work was finally scheduled, but we found out from the plumber on the day of repiping that the work for our unit had to be canceled and would have to be rescheduled for May. This was 5 hours after this work was scheduled to start and we had moved several items of furniture, took vacation time at work and arranged for other accommodations for a person that can't be exposed to COVID.  Things happen, but they have amplified an already stressful situation by not even telling us what happened or why the work was canceled. We have called several times in the last few days with absolutely no response. We have absolutely no faith in this company to manage this work and are so frustrated by their mismanagement.<//Review>< time>

Do not purchase property managed by this terrible company! I am with Riverbend  Master Association and they must subcontract to this organization. You can't get a hold of someone. After more than an hour on hold over various days, I finally got to talk to a person. They said they had 48 hours to call me back. You guessed it, they never did call me back. I am now on hold once again for 20+ minutes. I will bet they will not pick up or if they do I get another major runaround.</Review>

It has been a very negative and disappointing experience dealing with this company. I agree with another review on this page that their main function is collecting the monthly dues.
I wish there was a negative star to give to this company!
We submitted a complaint about an abusive neighbor over a year ago. Our contact A.S. mislead us for over six month about her communication  (or lack thereof) with the neighbor. One year later she is still giving us the run around. Yet I am sure I would be fined immediately if my tree was not trimmed in time!!!
We had to call the police last week and they were surprised that the HOA is not taking any action on our behalf!!!!

So many issues with this HOA, but let me discuss the latest. Concrete driveway work is being done. Notice was put up June 26, 2020 and work was to begin June 29th giving us less than 3 days to prepare because they did not offer a parking solution. Work was to be completed by July 6th, 2020 according to the notice. That did not happen. I finally called customer service on a July 10th and was told there was no record of work being done and that a supervisor would call me within the next couple days. That never happened, but we were finally able to park in our assigned spot Monday July 13th. We were inconvenienced for over 2 weeks and nobody would help or give us an answer.< /Review>

JUST PAY YOU CANNOT WIN.

I paid my association dues, but the amount was credited to the wrong account.  I called in to verify on the 15th of this month. I was told that the money was transferred to the correct account, but it looks like it was transferred after the 15ht. So I got a late fee per their statement.

Just got off the phone with First Service Customer Care in Florida.  She said that I shouldn't have to pay the late fee, but she would put in a request with the board.  But if I pay only this month's dues, I will owe the amount of the late fee on the 15th if the request to wave the late fees is not approved and processed before the 15th.

So I will owe late fees on the late fees, additionally they now charge a new Processing fee.  I guess this money goes to FSR and not the association.  Just noticed it on the bill:
"Please note should your account become more than 60 days past due a $75.00 processing fee will be charged." (Noted)

My Suggestions for those of us who purchased a home managed by FSR:

* Always pay by paper check, and write your address on the memo line.  That way you have proof.
*Call in to check on the status of your account.  If they make a mistake, or you don't know about the charges you are still responsible.  I would suggest you pay on the first and call in around the 8th of the month so you can mail them another check before the 15th.</review>

If I could provide negative ratings I would!!!! One of the worst companies to provide residential services. Most employees are completely inept in addressing the simplest issues. Simply incompetent and unresponsive ...:
-  Simple repairs such as the knob for a firepit can take up to 6 weeks
-  Other more major repairs can never be taken care of - Such as noise issues in the building that have been going on for over 6 months
- The company has a track record of hiring wrong people and companies to do work such as windows washing or fire inspection. Work is often done in an unorganized manner with destructive results

Stay away from hiring this company to do any property management  / residential services.<//review>

We have two properties with First Service Residential. The one in a different state has wonderful management and customer service. The property in La Quinta, CA has horrible customer service and the management is less than stellar. When you call Irvine for help, you wait 5 minutes or longer and then get a message that they are updating their systems and can't help you for at least another hour at which time you get hung up on. Perhaps they should do updates in the middle of the night.<//Review>

After cutting our trees on Alevera St in Oak Creek, all privacy is good as gone! Now we get to see the noisy street behind our house and stare at our neighbors' windows which are too close anyway. Landscaping is plain and dull and makes the community less appealing compared to greener and better maintained communities such as Quail Hill< /text>

Employees in the Philippines can email templated messages for far less than the employees you pay like P$mela B@iley.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>I would rate this company ZERO (0).

Recently we had an issue with a deceased tree related to the association adjacent to the backyard of our house in Pacific Hills , Mission viejo. We had several correspondences with the senior HOA property manager of Pacific Hills. She is totally rode and unhelpful. Just giving nonsense excuses to us for not trimming the tree and proper tree fungus treatment.
The deceased unhealthy leaves from the tree falling in our backyard and contaminating our SPA, flowers and plants.

The property manager is totally careless and unhelpful and rude.

I would give ZERO (0) to this company.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I would rate this company with a zero if I could.  Absolutely, worst customer service I have ever encountered with any property management company and I agree with other reviews, in which you are treated like "bottom of the barrel".  I pay my dues on time, follow the CCRs, and in my experience, First Residential only address concerns they chose to address and actually only reply to those they choose.  Really?  I don't understand how these people are even in business anymore. They actually blocked my emails (I believe because I reported their lack of response to a major concern to the County).  This responsibility ultimately lies on my Board of Directors for going along with their practices.  I am repulsed that they get away with these practices.  They have low ratings on Yelp and Google as well as Glass Door (written by employees of the company).  I live in Ladera Ranch which has a reputation for being held to high standards and I feel this company from the manager of Ladera downward has fallen short on my part.  According to reviews written by many homeowners residing in other associations managed by this company, I am not alone.  I yet have come across a site in which they have an overall positive rating.   I truly hope they are held accountable as they seem to play by their own rules.<//Review>

<Response>None<//Response><review>It is the worst management company that I have seen in the past 40 years.
They Charge $450 a month for a 300-400 K Condo and they don't do anything in return. You have to wait month and month before they fix a problem...and they send you bills for things that is their responsibility...
Schaub is the worse in the office and extremely hard to get a hold of.
They give you the run around.
No Gym, a pool that is broken most of the time, no holiday decorations, VERY STRICT laws etc...
Just to keep things short...RUN FROM THIS COMPANY...Many of my neighbors moved out because of them.< /review></record>

Run by a group of incompetent individuals.   Friend was visiting out of town and got his car towed, had incorrect towing company signage legally required in CA, spoke to Sam and he even admitted that he knew this legal signage was required.  This is the SECOND time this had happened, before they towed my car.  Said they would call my friend back that same day and did not.  When my friend asked Sam what the rules for guest parking were, he couldn't answer. Amazing that a company is trying to enforce rules their staff is too obtuse to even know.  His mom had to call out of work drive out here from AZ since he's visiting and the car is in her name.  A car they had no legal right to tow.  Signs say the tow companies party to our association are "Beach Cities Towing" and "OC Towing", but his vehicle was towed by iTow (which is just OC towing who's changed their name for the 3rd time probably over these predatory towing scandals), all the phone numbers and information are invalid. Not only are they run by idiots, but they are breaking the law.  Curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. We will be taking this issue to small claims. Zero stars to this entire joke of an establishment! Funny to see here this isn't the first claim of illegal activity from this place. Needs to be shut down< /Text>

<Review>Concur with other reviewer and would give 0/5 stars if I could.  Multitude of issues.  My significant other and myself both own units in the Newport Beach property and she had significant damage to her unit through no fault of her own and the HOA (which is not directly First Residential but their decision to switch management to First Residential which no one really understands) did take some credit but the repair was incredibly untimely and the work was shoddy at best, and was only done after enough legal action was threatened.  This being on top of already incredibly high HOA dues around $450/month on properties worth between 350-550k with, in my opinion, little to show for the dues.

Second issue is when trying to pay dues or switch to automatic payments, I've had a conversation to no avail in trying to explain to not automatically draft more than double my monthly HOA as well as have the second parking pass removed.  I'm sure it will be worked out in a credit and the parking pass and additional fee removed, but the act of talking to the Rhodes Scholars managing the phones, quite honestly, I almost don't care at this point and they can just have the extra $500/month as I am sure I will get the credit down the road.  Long story short, very impersonable and mismanaged all the way around.<//Review><userid>100591648214394117413<//userid><rate>1< /rate>< name>

I would have given 0 stars, but it wasn't possible.  Like others have said, it is impossible to get through to a person!  The person I was directed to contact for help, Kim Dinh, was worthless.  She would never call me to help even when I specifically asked for help with automatic payments.<//review>

<Text>If there was a ZERO that is what I would rate this company.  Do not select them to manage your community.  They do not have the homeowners or communities best interest in their vocabulary.  All they want is to collect their check and screw everyone else over.  Worst management company I have ever dealt with.  Truly horrible.  I work in Real Estate and have never heard a management company that won't repair things that are hazardous and that is just the start.  If you want your community to become bitter and property values to suffer, hire them.  Atrocious company.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Very convenient location and people are always so nice. But 18 dollars is to much. When some other car washes have a little more, like pressured air and better vacuums. And the highest price is 13 dollars. But other then that always a great experience.</Text>< time>

Wont go back again.  Wash doesn't wash car well, and does a horrible job drying.   I asked the attendant to borrow a towel and told me I needed to purchase one after his machine didn't do its job properly.  And the vaccum is very weak.</text>

Very tasty Peruvian cuisine...small seating area and service is stretched to keep up with crowds, but they are friendly. For the taste, well worth a trip in for a bite. The lomo saltado always warms my heart.</review>

Do you want to try something different? Experience the flavor of real  Peruvian food! My favorite, "Lomo Saltado". Beef with potatoes, red onions and tomatoes accompanied with rice and the exquisite flavor of the Peruvian culinary taste. You must try it before you settle for a burger or tacos!<//review>

Great food. We had the cau cau, chanfainita (not in the menu, you have to ask for it) ceviche and tallarines verdes con pollo apanado. The flavors did not dissapoint and the service was quick and friendly. It used to be El rincon de Giovannita( which was a good restaurant) and I dare to say this restaurant is better so far.</Review>

I was here last weekend and had the tallarines verdes with steak. They were very good and authentic. The rest of my group had a Ceviche Giovannita and they loved it! I don't eat seafood but this came with about 4-5 different items and they absolutely loved every item on that plate and thought the portions were great. Very good Peruvian food here!< /Text>

These people are amazing! Always super professional and kind. I've been going here for years and they're never even mean about my lazy flossing; just super encouraging when I do make progress. I moved to WA a few years ago, and STILL DRIVE OUT (20 hrs) for appointments.<//Text>

Dr. D is one of a kind, he cares about his patients and takes the time to ensure comfort and perfection. His office staff is amazing, each and every one of them. Not only is this a professional practice, they make you feel like family, which is very hard to find in any medical field these days. I am very grateful to have been referred to them.<//Review>

There can be no stronger statement about how much we think of Dr. D and his staff than to state we drive over 6 hours from Arizona to continue our relationship with his dental team.  We have been patients for well over 20 years and cannot imagine changing dentists. Their professional care and friendly environment makes you always glad to have an appointment.< /Text>

I've been going to Dr. D'Addario for the last 10 years and I've been searching for a dentist like him for awhile. He stays on top with the latest technics and technologies, super detailed and takes the time to explain and go over all the available options. His staff is super amazing as well. My cleaning is always 45-60 minutes, they check you for everything and doing super thorough job. I honestly cant say enough of how great they are.  They are not cheapest, but I rather pay extra and know that my teeth will be taken care by the best dentist!</text>

This dentist office is amazing.  From the way they handle the patient when stepping into the office, sitting in a chair and to the time you leave.  I talked to Lisa the front office person and she was friendly and made sure that I was taken care of.  Leah was the assistant that worked with the doctor and she was nice and also very personable.  Doctor d’addario was great to me while he was examining my teeth.  He was funny and also made sure that I understood what was going on with my teeth.  I’m scheduled to go back in to the office in September and I look forward to seeing the staff and doctor d’additional again.< /text>

<Text>What a wonderful doctor and office staff. So caring! I am so thankful to have found Dr D’Addario. After a past negative dental experience I was looking for a dentist who really cared about his patients and that is exactly what I was blessed to find in Dr D. I had been told I needed a crown and fillings replaced by past dentist and Dr D assured me it was completely unnecessary. It can be hard finding a dentist who is thorough, talented and honest and caring but Dr D is definitely all of those. He takes much time to listen and to thoroughly examine and y’all about the issues you’re concerned about and explains everything so well. I am thankful to be under his care!<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Dr. D'Addario is an excellent dentist. He is thorough and doesn't hurt. His equipment is state of the art. Megan has been my hygienist every time I have had my teeth cleaned and she is wonderful. Friendly front desk staff is an added bonus!  I have never waited more than one minute.  Highly recommend.< /text>< Name>

Dr. D, Sorry we missed you during our recent visit. Your efforts on behalf of your patients and staff are outstanding! We enjoyed listening to music in our car waiting for the all clear to go up to the office. Your planning, and the execution of those plans, demonstrates that your commitment to the safety of your patients and staff is at the same high level as your care has always been. Much appreciated!! Thank you all.</Text>

Dr. D is so professional and conscientious of patients' needs during this period of anxiety. All staff are beyond helpful! Thanks to Lisa, Kristina, Natalie and Megan-who has been my hygienist for a few years and makes it easy and fun!  Dr D has communicated his practices to all patients and my exam and cleaning was completely safe on June 16. I have been a patient for 20 years and would never change!<//review>

<review>Dr. D’Addario and staff are as good as they come!! Dr.D. is a gifted, skilled perfectionist. He is honest, never over diagnosis’s and is exceptional in all aspects of dentistry! He has such a great eye when it comes to cosmetic treatment. I couldn’t be happier with the way my smile turned out and have confidently referred other very please family members.
His team of hygienist’s, assistant’s and front office are absolutely top notch. You will not find a better dental practice! ❤️</review></record></dataset><record>

I just love Dr D!  He makes you feel so comfortable and his level of care is excellent.  He doesn’t pre-sell services when not needed.
The hygienist and office staff are so friendly and engaging, and it’s always so nice to feel so welcome when I come in for cleanings or dental work.
I highly recommend Dr D to my friends and anyone looking for a good dentist.</Review>

My visit yesterday to Dr. D'Addario for routine exam and cleaning, was as uneventful as they have been for more years that I chose to think about. Overdue because of current circumstances, I was not surprised that everything was now setup to be as safe as possible.  My wife and I do not ever plan on changing dentists.< /review>

<Review>Cool little place, very busy of course.  Great price for what you get.  I got the summer splash tea which I ordered half sweet but I still find to be very very sugary.  Very fast service and very polite staff.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr1guw5qId_u5KkcklpAfR9wHoIypWtxT9_oxZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5a4fTormG1kcp3iECHxWScLlEc_NclsUIn_Tc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>A cute little place with pretty lighting and fancy looking furniture. The tables lit up and even the walls were pretty! The service was great and fast. The staffs were really friendly. The taiyaki ice cream was delicious and the fish was fresh, warm, and crispy. The boba drink was also delicious. We got the Strawberry flavored ice cream/Nutella filling/oreo topping, Mango ice cream/Whipped cream filling, coffee ice cream/Red beans filling/ injeolmi topping, and a #1 House Special Boba drink.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhnv1EhenZbhHhsA0w9iGOEdlduqzqCraowhEq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnGk2Csr86o-SnR5zRo7NdxZY7IBfOnfM1ynU5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_E3PJXzKIrJ4yOvkElzT22rKLmp47EwGGguyQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtqQqvs1op8v9NMDSRg-XhV2fj6Cwc1M08ASbG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgPWQv99vP9cmAz_mYaXAtawiXzoFEExmQ-Up1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>This place used to be the spot after a day of work. Then it became a place where I first took interest in unique twists on your conventional boba drinks. From the Lee's Okinawa (reg. Okinawa BMT with a hint of wintergreen) to the ever refreshing "Oh My Stars" & can't forget the dreamy, creamy "XOXO". Im 4rm outta town, but way back when this place was "Sno-crave" (I still got 1 of those punch cards somewhere lol) I always went out of my way to come here. It's sad to see a hollow shell of what once was, knowing deep down it will never become. this place holds a special place in my heart and even though I didn't get one last Lee's Okinawa I will still throw up them 5 stars. Sad 2 see u go, now where am I supposed to get my brick toast???<//Text>< Pics>

This was my favorite place but we came today(June 28,2020) and noticed the store is permanently closed... Like the signs are teared off... So just a heads up!<//Text>

My family and I go to on tap every time for boba, great drinks and the bobas always perfect. The only problem I have is the seating and the place is a little dirty:/<//Text>

<review>Really tasty tea! And my friend ordered a smoothy, and she got a second cup almost completely full with the leftover smoothie that was still in the blender!

The best boba in Sacramento, hands down! It is impossible to run out of new flavor combinations to try. However, there is not a lot of seating when it is busy and the music can be very loud at times.< /Review>

I don't agree that the milk tea is top notch. It tastes like a powder medicine when kids get cold. Sencha in the USA or Gongcha in Asian countries are far better.</text>

Good quality milke tea. Coconut budding is delicious but have to go there early to buy it since it can be sold put fast. I tried their brick toasts and they tasted great. I'd recommend bringing one to three friends to share if you are going to order one brick toast. The store closed down due to COVID19.<//review>

I like the variety of tea drinks. I usually drink coffee while studying but the tea drinks served here are just as satisfying.<//Review>

<Text>Didn't like this place. They got my order wrong twice; first the seal was broken, drink spilled everywhere, then they forgot to put sugar into my drink and the boba was really hard to chew. I would not recommend drinking the boba drinks. The table was very dirty and the employees was unfriendly. I know it was a slow day but they gave little to no attention to their customers. The old teahouse next door is so much better.< /Text><Name>Darshweni S</Name>< pictures>

The Cant Elope and Oh My Stars were both very good. Boba was a good texture.  Fruit tea drinks tend to be very sweet, so be wary!< /Review>

Charged me $550.20 up front not even on the day of my root canal and then the day of wanted me to sign forms with amounts that were blank, not just for the root canal, but for medicine too. You wouldn't sign a blank check, so why would I sign forms that were not already filled out. Very suspicious, so I asked for a refund.< /Text>

I’ve been going here for 5 years. The entire staff is awesome. They take such good care of me and my teeth. They are so nice and friendly. And they always talk with me about the best procedures to keep my teeth healthy. I honestly can’t recommend this place enough.  Also they have validated parking which is key.<//Text>

<Date>1568598074421<//Date><Review>Went in for a cleaning and first time patient xrays. Cleaning was great but the amount of up-sell and pressure was heavy handed. I get it. Everyone should get a deep cleaning but asking me if I wanted to negotiate my co-pay was tacky and then having me sign a waiver to prove i declined it was overkill. The clinic is dated and needs its own deep cleaning.<//Review><user>112013701497210346344<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Hi. This is a pleasant place to be, even though it's (shudder) a dental office. Everyone from the front desk to the treatment chair is kind, easygoing, and thoroughly professional in every way as they move you through diagnostics and care. They're great communicators and have inspired me to up my game after a lifetime of thinking my good old brush and floss routine was doing the job. It may sound odd, but my teeth and gums feel more alive and my exams show a much happier mouth. Cheers!</Text>< UserId.>

I have been going to Sunset Dental since residing in L.A. 8 years ago. I highly recommended this office to anyone looking for excellent dental care. I personally have friends and my husband going to this office. Dr. Poneh and the entire staff at Sunset Dental are incredibly professional, warm, informative and accommodating.</review>

I was so pleasantly surprised to stumble across SPD, as I was blindly trying to find a new dentist for my son and I. We had a bad experience when we first moved here, so I was weary about our chances, as I was also trying to find a dentist that would take my insurance.
Everyone there was polite, professional and communicated very clearly. The work was thorough and precise, and the environment was comfortable and clean.
Very happy with Sunset Plaza Dental!< /Review>

<review>Unethical sheisters.  I come in with extreme pain, that from experience I assume is infection and root canal.  The tell me our endodontist is not here till next week, but we think you have a gum infection take this mouth wash come back next week and well reexamine you.  I suffer for a few days in intense pain when someone ethical would have referred me to an emergency endodontist to treat the tooth.  I took care of it elsewhere and will never return to this place look elsewhere for someone who doesn't let people needlessly suffer to make a few bucks.< /review>< username>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>They have great selections of fresh and salt water fishes, and pet birds from time to time. Pet supplies on the wall was a little bit tricky to find because it look a bit messy at first, but it gets better as time goes by and by the time you are less disoriented and learnt their logic of placing stuffs around. Although it's a small pet store, but you will be able to get what you want. Decent price. Easy to find parking on the streets and the owner couples speak Spanish, English and Chinese<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I'm a second generation customer of this pet store. They have been our go to store for about 20 years. Joe is very knowledgeable (& bilingual!) about the animals. I go to his store for everything I need for my parrot I was gifted from his store 17 years ago. Family run and family owned. I don't know what I'd do without them.</review>

<Text>If I can give this place 10 stars I will... I will because Joe and Doris (owner) there really nice person always with a smile on there face always there to help you. They have anything you need from salt water fish, fresh water, birds and dogs, cats, hamsters, snakes any kind of animal you might have at home. Whatever you need believe me you will find it here and if you dont see it just ask him he will get it for you. I come here because I have a salt water tank at home with his advice he guide on what to do what I need with my tank and so far is been 2 years none of my fish have die.
But I just gotta say come check it out there really nice people there prices on everything are good/fair I'm just so lucky to have them close to my house in my city.
Thank you Joe and Doris for everything you guys do and treat everyone keep up the good work.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>I saw in the pictures before coming to this place that they have green-cheeked conures in really small cages all together. Those kind of parrots need lots of space like other birds. Please try to take care of the birds as well as you take care of the fish!< /text></record>

<response>None</response><Text>This place is very small and people have a hard time walking around. They have a variety of fish and coral but they put as many fish in a tank as possible so there aren’t actually a lot of tanks. The prices are written on a sticky note which is placed on the tanks (hard to read) and some fish don’t have correct prices or aren’t placed right. They have one tank with coral and fish on a top shelf that you can’t even really see so there may only be two tanks of coral you can see. They have a nice variety of clownfish. They have a lot more fresh water fish than saltwater. They are called Bell Bird Farm but only have parakeets and love birds and the rest is fish and pet supplies.<//Text><date>1546240531301<//date><Name>panda guinea pig<//Name>< pics>

Tight and noisy, this place is hell for hamsters and birds, their cages are too small and overcrowded with the animals looking sickly and halfway dead. The only good thing here is the fish cages which is actually what they seem to care about. The fish tank water is always clean with no dead fishes floating around, and all seem to be bright and happy. Don't bother buying supplies here because you'll be ripped off. Only semi good note is that they will buy any hamsters from you if your hamsters accidentally bred or you got two different genders accidentally. I think they also do the same with birds.<//Review>

<review>I loved this place because the staff was very friendly, spoke pretty good English and had a wide variety of Rare plecos for super fair prices ! This review is biased because I came into the store ignoring all the other pets and supplies, and focused only on their fresh water fish collection. However from an aquarium enthusiast, the fish selection is great ! And the staff is friendly and helpful!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I bought my pineapple conure Riley from bell bird farm 5 years ago and have not had to take my conure not even once to vet has been and still is very healthy. Their very attentive and take good care of the birds well all animals. What I like about them is that when you buy a bird, they make sure it's able to eat on it's own when it's a baby still about 3 months before they send them home with you. That shows the commitment they have with their animals and how good they take care of them, which means they care about their customers and don't want to or will not sell an unhealthy animal just to make a sale, that speaks alot about them. I would recommend this pet shop, and will be buying another bird in the days to come.</Review>

Found this LFS by chance on Craigslist. Ad mention a large variety of hard to find pleco's so I decided to make the 20 mile drive to check it out. My first impression was that this place is small and I won't find what I'm looking for. Well I guessed wrong. Found an EDJD for 12.99. 12.99!!! My LFS wanted between $20-$40 for a 1" and got me a close to 2" for a lot leas. Also their pleco selection didn't disappoint. Vampires, golden nuggets, royals, avocado, and pelckoltia compta. Picked up a 2" pelckoltia for $12.99 which I found to be a bargain. Definitely will make the 20 mile drive in the future when I get a larger tank.< /Text>

< Review>
Ordered the impossible burgers, no mayo, no ketchup, side of well done fries and Dr pepper for my drink.
What I got instead was an impossible burgers drownin in mayo, soggy fries and a diet Pepsi.
Pointed this out to the woman working the drive thru window and she tried to tell me I got exactly what I ordered.
Eventually got a new bun out of her and considered the rest a loss. 👎🏻< /Review>

<Review>Just an average old BK. Nothing special about it except no taxes, a la being connected to the Bx Exchange. Other than that, nothing different or exceptional here. You get what you would expect.<//Review>< time>

Angry whopper. Bacon cheese with onion rings and jalapenos. It tasted very good. Cost more then I want but still good.</Review>

Best burger king in the area, the one in Lompoc doesn't use good meat,  the base BK seems to use higher quality meat.</review>

<Text>Service was quick, but my order of mac n cheetos was burned and dried out; they looked and tasted like they had been sitting out all day. Dining area was fairly clean and staff were friendly, so I still give it three stars.<//Text><user_name>Darren Boehler</user_name><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><userid>106915744833064884551<//userid>< gmap_id>

Worst fries ever.  Burgers just OK.  Slow computer causing customer back-up.  Understandably Robin visibly aggravated.</Review>

<response>None</response><text>(Translated by Google) Burger King from the Vandenberg area base in Lompoc Ca. It is a fantastic experience where my coworkers and I have breakfast every day, Rosa, Sara, Martina and Hong are like family they already know what we order and if we do not eat well they worry because they know that our work requires a good breakfast. Thank you for having such a nice staff that makes us feel at home.

<Time>1617003334828</Time><Review>Love this place! They remind me of the place we had gone to in Maui a few years ago
They have loads of flavors and pretty good size servings kiddie, regular, and large. Regular is enough to share between 2 people to be honest.  I usually get macadamia nut ice cream and my 3 flavors with a snow cap (condensed milk) always yummy. Definitely recommend to get the app belly before to save points towards rewards. Give them a try if in the area.
(pictured is a regular and a large for size reference)</Review>< rate>

The best shaved ice I've had in a WHILE! True shaved ice, the island way. Fluffy, pillow soft ice... not that rocky, crunchy nonsense 😒 Flavors are spot on, and the price is great! You can honestly split their large between 2 people, but I ate most of it solo 😁 even the snow cap was legit. They definitely didn't skimp or take the easy way out like most shops I've tried. Heavy cream may be cheaper, but there's nothing like good old condensed milk... I'd been missing that most of all. I got the "rainbow" with (condensed milk) snowcap. The pictures don't even do it justice.< /text>

<Review>This place is really good. I had a cotton candy regular size with dole whip in the middle. And it was actually a really good combination surprisingly. Shaved ice is my favorite and I get shaved ice occasionally but lately I’ve been getting it more frequently. The ice is smooth and soft. The condensed milk(snow cap) was a bit sinked in so I had no real point of getting it so that’s why it was I bit disappointed. But no worries it wasn’t too bad. But overall this place deserves more popularity.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1621363838580, 'text': "Ava! We are so sorry it's taken us this long to thank you for your amazing review. We appreciate the 5 star review despite your slight disappointment with our toppings.

This place has the best shave ice outside of Hawaii. It really brought me back to my honeymoon. It's all about the shave, right? This place has ice that's like a cloud. They have a ton of flavors, and can make them sour if that's your thing... they also have a non-dairy pineapple ice-cream that is so smooth. Definitely give this place a try. Definitely.<//Text>

<Review>So good! Addicted.the staff are cute - always scurrying to keep up with orders and get people exactly what they asked. Food service isn’t easy! I always try to crack a smile at them because they always look so worried and serious lol.
The flavors are top notch and strong.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
There’re a few choices for ice cold desserts in Sawtelle Japantown and this is my favorite for its fruity tasting syrups, “snow cap” sweetened condensed milk and pineapple flavored frozen dole whip.

A regular shave ice includes 3 items in any combo of toppings including syrups, dole whip and Fosselman’s ice cream. You can add more toppings at additional cost.

Note: No public restroom, eat-in space very small, no validated parking.</Review>

<time>1575750660566<//time><Rate>5</Rate><review>One of the most satisfying shaved ice places around. One of the hallmarks is that you can get pineapple Dole whip as your filling, which pairs exceptionally well with most flavors. The staff is especially wonderful, and the turnaround it lightning quick. There's both indoor and outdoor seating. It's a great easy dessert to any meal you get in the area.< /review>< pics>

Friendly, attentive staff that assertively upholds the COVID safety requirements. And of course the shaved ice was soft, sweet, and refreshing in a great variety of flavors. Definitely reccomend to anyone looking for a tasty treat this summer!<//Review>

<review>Although the shaved ice and other treats were delicious, I left very disappointed. This was because a medium sized shaved ice was served in a huge styrofoam tub. Not only that but it was also made in a whole different plastic cup. I think this is very wasteful and bad for the environment.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Well its 3pm on a Sunday on a warm summer day and every place is packed except this place we should have taken that as a sign. We decided to try this place we took our order to go we walked outside and took our first taste of the shaved ice omg this was nasty. It totally reminded me of when I was s kid and the freezer has alot of ice built up and we had to scrape it to get it off and some would end up in your mouth YUCK!!!! It tasted like chemicals was not worth the 11.00 we spent!! It went straight in the garbage< /text>

<review>Found this amazing place on accident one hot Thursday! It was inexpensive, super delicious, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with our visit! Not to mention,  the serving sizes are huge! My fiance and I ordered a large to split and it only cost us $6! This is now one of our favorite places to go! We love this clean little treasure enough to fight 40 minutes of traffic each way to come get the coolest treat in town!<//review><Name>Valerie Dunn</Name><Rating>5</Rating>< user>

<review>It was saturday night. After passing this location looking for a good desert and meeting disappointment, I decided that shaved ice was a good idea. I spent a minutes looking over the menu, which is very well put together, might I add. There were several very satisfied customers out front on the tables so I was sure this was a good pick.  I started to order and was interrupted with "sorry, hold on 1 second" while she walked to the back talking with someone and comes back. She said "I'm sorry we are closed and can't serve you." I looked at my watch its 11:01 they close at 11:00. Might I add that we had traveled out of our way to find a place that was open this late. I will not be returning to this location unless it is the only place in a zombie apocalypse with the cure to save the world. I hope the owner finds a way to handle situations like this in the future.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Brian's shaved Ice is almost as good as the product in Hawaii- still a solid choice for dessert in Sawtelle. You can choose 2/3 syrup flavors to add to your ice cone and even add dole whip or ice cream in the middle! The small is actually a good portion and sometimes even sharable amongst two if you just want a small bite.

The ice here is pretty fine with a few coarse bits. They have a huge amount of flavors to choose from and give a good amount of syrup- I'm sure you can also ask for extra. The condensed milk is always a delicious addition and they don't skimp. The dole whip is refreshing and I like the vanilla ice cream too. This is as close to Hawaiian shaved ice as you can get in West LA!< /Review>

Decided to write my first review, as I usually avoid. Usually consider when something is bad and I'm frustrated with establishment. They offered a buy 1 get 1 free on a Ralph’s receipt so asked for 2 dole whips. 2 employees didn't know what to do so manager comes over and says sorry, only for shaved ice, but no restrictions noted other than day and times. After arguing finally relented to offer me and he was really pissed. No other words than costs and then moved products to other table for me to pick up. So much for aloha spirit. Now it's 80 degrees and almost 7 pm and place is empty on a Thursday. So figure with that unprofessional attitude and service like I'm in the wrong for something printed. I clearly see why they may be struggling and needed to do a coupon. I'm driving all the way to Hollywood for my dole whip from here on in as they are a disgrace for anything related to Hawaii or representation.<//review>

<Response>None</Response><Review>After our dinner at Hurry Curry around the corner we decided to get a little dessert-y something here. It's a cute little shop, all decked out island style, and it reminded me of my good times in HI. Anyhoo, after perusing their extensive menu I went with their combo special which was the taro shaved ice with snow cap--they had a name for it but I forgot what it was called. It really hit the spot; the shaved ice is nice and soft and had a great natural taro flavor, and I always love the "snow cap" (condensed milk) for the extra creamy flavor. They also have that Dole Whip here if you're a fan (which I am). Definitely a nice little treat.</Review><Time>1412611830350< /Time>< rating>

< Review>
First time coming here after Marugame Udon, this place was small but it was good. This place reminded me of the Hawaiian style shaved ice with a sweet center. That is not to say I've had the Hawaiian style shaved ice before.  We ordered the small and it was enough for me to share with my girlfriend. We had ice cream center, which it was mentioned at their place is sourced by Fossilmens ice cream.<//Review>

I remember when I came back from Hawaii, I was craving their light shaved ice with strawberry creamed slush on top. AND THIS PLACE HAS IT!!!

Lines are never crazy. The service is always great and genuine. Get a stamp card and come often! Prices are good enough for you to try all the different flavors. You can also get dolewhip here too :)< /text>

This is my joint!  It's unpretentious, classic, simple, refreshing and I don't need to wait 30min.  The three flavors I highly recommend are (mostly for adults):  Strawberry Cream; Green Tea with redbean; and the Dole Whip.<//review>

I've had Hawaiian Shaved ice All over this city.  (There aren't that many places.)  It's also one of my favorite treats when i go to Hawaii.  So, once I ate here, I instantly became a fan and will always use Brian's as my way to curb the Shaved Ice beast that lives within.

They are the most authentic shaved ice place I've encountered.  They aren't that blocky icey snow cone crap.< /text>

The shave ice is delish. we ordered the sour face and piña colada and both were really good. The guy making them did not have the best customer service did not welcome us nor he smiled at any point, to me customer service is a big deal.< /review>

Best Hawaiian shaved ice I've ever had! When I first went there, I was like "how good can shaved ice be, it's just crushed ice cubes" and was delightfully proven wrong. They get their ice shavers from Hawaii, so it is true to its name and oh so delicious. The shave ice is really soft and flavorful. Make sure to get dole whip inside your shaved ice (or just separately) to round out your Hawaiian experience!!

Sometimes when I'm not feelin shaved ice, I just go there for their dole whip or ice cream. They have yummy ice cream flavors, like white chocolate macadamia or green tea (my personal favorite).

Definitely stop by at least once when you're in Sawtelle and you want an alternative to the never ending boba or blockheads!<//text>

First time I had a shaved ice was in Hawaii years ago. I can now save the plane fair and come here when the urge calls! What is it with finely shaved ice and flavored suger poured over it? Don't know, dkntt want to know, it just takes great. Here you choose your size, your filling, your flavor, and your toping. Sit in the sun and enjoy.</Text>

Pretty gross burger meat taste I've a sping no flavor real bland. The burger buns were hard. The chicken strips were pretty nasty. Chicken strips were curled up they looked awful. Overall bad experience.  So much $$;to not have enjoyed our dinner.  I definitely don't recommend this restaurant.< /Text>

NEVER NEVER order the Hard Shell Chicken Tacos UNLESS you are eating them there.    From the time I left to the time I got home (about 6-7 min) the tavos were SOGGY and FALLING APART!!! I ate the first one it wasn't too bad but when I got to the 2nd & 3rd taco they were so soggy it was DISGUSTING!!!<//text>

I Ordered over the phone while I was waiting for the bus.
A Jr burger special with a Coke and extra seasoning on the fries came just as I ordered it and was hot and friendly. The food was hot and the workers were friendly.

Soda could use a little more carbonation to give it that, Coke taste and feeling.

90% clean dining section outside.

Over all great Time 😊, Thanks Tom and His Son and their Burgers.<//Review>

Today's staff was very professional in basics of customer service.

No indoor dinning, however, this location does have limited outdoor dining.

Edit: as of April - May 2021 they do allow indoor dining scattered tables to still follow "social distance”.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Pictures>

Quick Service, decent food when you are in rush. Red Souce, right on!!!
Costumer service through drive-thru is decent, no complaints whatsoever.
Asada burrito, chicken taquitos, and taquitos with guacamole 👍👍👍<//text>

One star because there charging a service fee of 55 cent with and debit or credit card ATM fee. Look I know 55 cents who  cares . Wrong  that’s out of my pocket there not  announcing it or any sign of a fee for a card.  That’s wrong I understand if there is a charge but you cant just charge it and not say anything about it. Here in the US we call that steeling. Fix it!< /text>

Untop of all that it's over priced af, I paid 26 bucks for raw food  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️</review>< pictures>

Food is good, it does take a while to get your food. They have a drive thru, and plenty of parking spaces. They also have tables outside if you want to eat outside.< /Text>

<Review>The food is good and the service is usually fast. The staff is great most of the times. The reason of the 3 stars is because the last time a bought a burrito, it was way too big I couldn't eat half of it. It was kind of expensive too, but I don't really mind about that. My point is. They should have smaller burritos for people who don't eat that much. By the way I don't think someone could eat that much< /Review>< Resp>

<Review>wouldn't bother coming back! worst customer service people just talking or facing the customers without even making the food! I'm not saying it's bad to have fun at work but come on to a certain point you have to be professional only one girl gave out good customer service the rest were just talking not caring much about the customers orders.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>Fries were stale,limp not crispy. The oil was dirty im sure. Such a waste. Chilli fries were stuck to the paper(yellow) they wrapped them in. My chicken burger was dripping of wet lettuce and soggy bread.The Avocado was past its point. Only good thing was the soda. Blah!!

Tom's Jr. is a gem of a place. The chicken tacos are to die for and the prices are super reasonable. this is one of my favorite classic burger joints. The break is also very good. 2.99 and you get a great classic breakfast. I highly suggest checking out this spot</review>

<review>4/11/21 update: thanks to that lady that has tattoos for gladly exchanging my burrito. 4/10/21 update : I bought a burrito and i specifically told the girl "no spicy sauce" in my burrito because i suffer from gastritis, i get home and started eating it and the first thing i taste is hot salsa in it. They need to ask you weather you want hot souce or not!! Some of those little girls are rude, lazy and flirty specially the cute ones.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Aldo Martinez<//user_name>< date>

Bad idea it was to stop by Tom’s junior and have their breakfast. Their hashbrowns were really dry and soggy.And also the muffin I had ordered look like it was microwaved.The muffin wasn’t toasted it was stuck to the paper like it should as if it were microwaved.thanks a lot never again Toms Jr breakfast 👎👎👎<//text>

<Review>Make sure to check your receipt when buying a combo. Last time I receive a receipt from that company it did not said the size of the combo. It only said combo. Make sure you know what you buying. Employee name that says on the receipt is: Tais Pedro.<//Review>< pics>

Food is good, but a bit pricey for a burger joint. Prices are 10-20% higher than comparable places in the area. What I absolutely HATE, is that they charge you a 55 cent fee for using your card! No one in this area does this, and at their prices, it's a real rip off! Bring cash.< /text>

Great food, chili fries are delicious and always spot on. The family pack is best, i love they they give you the option of having 2 chicken sandwiches and two ham burgers. Customer service is 50/50  sometimes you get great service and others not so great.<//Text>

The food was good but they advertise one price then charge you another(more that is). They advertise a pastrami combo for 7.99 but when I ordered two, I paid almost $20. I advised the staff but I still had to pay the $9/combo. That said, the food was good and there were no complaints there.I can't give this restaurant repeat business due to the fact the I wasn't the only one who had a compliant about their pricing. **SOMEONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRICING**(Weights and Measures...wink wink)< /text>

The food was good. It was insanely hot inside though. I don't know if it was because we sat close to the kitchen or their ac wasn't working. I didn't get to try their milkshake because i was too full but i would definitely come back to try it, but please fix the a.c if it was broken. Thanks</review>

Their bread when they toasted is half toast, they need a better toaster, other than that is good service.</Review>

This goes for the drive thru service because the person taking the order was rude. I didnt get a thank you &she didnt ask me if I wanted any ketchup or dressing although she did put a little of everything all I wanted was ketchup. Everything I ordered was shoved in one bag!<//Text>

They don't ask what type of drink you want when ordering a combo. They just give you Coke, never been to a fast food place that doesn't ask what type of drink you desire.< /review>

This is a good burger place. I have tried almost all of their menu and Their burritos could be better and their guacamole on the carne asada fries is not thick enough. But burgers and fries are bomb!<//text>

<Text>Employees are way out of line. (ATTITUDE) POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ..!!! Does not pay attention to the correct orders. Ex ) I ordered 2 Ranch, and 2 Thousand Island. (Was on the reciept)
Employee handed me 2 Thousands, told here I ordered 4. (Pointing the recipt at her face). She then comes with 4 (Thousand Islands). Then I told her, No I ordered 2 thousand and 2 ranch..employee then does not express a friendly face 😠</Text>< Pics>

They're pretty big and they're good because they aren't super greasy. It's good hangover good. Haha. Get a side of ranch and thousand. It's a bummer they don't have shakes but honestly it's probably a good thing. Haha. The service is good and they are always nice. There is almost always a line but it's fast. The food is cooked to order too. Oh and my bfs son digs their chili cheese fries. 👌😁</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Very clean place. The staff was very friendly. They have a variety of things on their menu. I order the cali burger with a side of chilli cheese fries. It wasn't what I expected. It was more lettuce than anything else on that burger. My burger was meat deprived. The chilli cheese fries were pretty good. It was my first time there and I would go again mostly because the cleanliness but I will try something else of their menu</text>

It is an amazing place and it's atmosphere is a very good sensation.  At times you can see a rooster or chicken s walking around the parking lot don't mind them and they wont bother you.  The food is great and affordable.  Just don't go aski g for carne asada fries or pastrami chili cheese fries.  Those will Dent your wallrt.  Service is amazing and the place is clean. Great place to eat.  Will come again<//review>

The drive through is always long which is fine, but when you go to place your order they don't give you chance to look at the menu and they are rude. Food is good but customer service in the drive through needs some work.< /Text>

<text>It's delish! Food that is really made to order. Avocado bacon chicken burger (without the bacon) on a hearty wheat bun, real grilled chicken breast, and plenty of avocado. Yummm! Service is fine. I hope they keep up the quality of food, service, and atmosphere for years to come.<//text>< Pictures>

This place is pretty bad.  Fries had no salt and undercooked and the burger was OK.  Not the best.  I think jacks burger is better.</Review>

This place is better than your average charbroiled burger joint, but expect to pay more. Small chilli cheese fries over 5$  Pastrami sandwich 9$. At those prices I'd go to The Hat.</review>

<UserId.>113596319861098012655<//UserId.><Text>Honestly I personally  like the food here (some), but the services is THE WORST!. The Girl VERONIKA VELASQUEZ(as it said on the receipt) working in the Drive thru was very distracted by her coworkers yelling and laughing in the back. I had to repeat myself more than three times for her to get my order right not only that but once I pulled up for her to charge me the amount of $14.39. I only have her $13 and as she continued laughing w/ her co worker she then again asked me if I gave her $15.00. I said yes (it's not my fault she's not paying attention)lol. And she still returned $1.00 back to me. Once my food was handed to me she said have a good day and forgot to give me my drinks. I then asked her for my drinks. At that point I was already frustrated and wanted to leave. Once I'm about to eat my food I notice she also gave the wrong drinks. Everything she did was WRONG!!! Like I Said, foods good but The Service Is HORRIBLE. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 And This Specifically goes out to The Girl in the drive thru  VERONIKA VELASQUEZ ! You need to step it up and work on  paying attention to what you're doing! 👏🏻< /Text></record>

We enjoyed the chili cheese fries with carne asada. You have to let the cashier know that you want carne asada on top.</text>

The food is nice, but it looks so terrible inside and out... but don't let the place fool you cause it does have some decent food that taste okay, it's worth it to try it once< /Review>

My teriyaki plate was so disgusting. The chicken was tasteless and the plate was nothing but sweet. The salad was nasty and the service was not friendly. The chili cheese fries where nasty and tasteless. The restaurant should provide moré quality food And better custumer service<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Hello, I was in this place today and the young appointment that attends the take-out window (the one who does the orders and has a microphone) has a terrible service 😡 I'm sorry, but it's true, I'm not going back there, my daughter told me, why The very rude young woman was upset, I hope that if she reads this comment, that everything will be fixed in case she has problems.
Go to the Toms on Long Beach.

(Translated by Google) They should visit it and if they have already done it they should repeat it, although in my case it was the first time I went, I really liked the atmosphere and the normal service with nothing to complain about, and very clean above all, in addition to the very good food prepared and delicious.

(Original)
Deben visitarlo y si ya lo han hecho lo deben repetir, aunque en mi caso fué la primera vez que iba, me gustó mucho el ambiente y el servicio normal sin nada de que quejarse, y muy limpio ante todo, ademá de la comida muy bien preparada y deliciosa.<//review>
