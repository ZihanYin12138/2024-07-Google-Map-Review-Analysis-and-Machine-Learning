Although the site is a bit far from where I live, it was the only Covid-19 testing site that performed rapid and relatively affordable PCR tests that are necessary for travel. I paid for the same day test result options and was told that the results typically come faster (2-4 pm rather than by 7 pm as stated.)

However, I am happy to say that the results came even faster! I got my results at 12 pm, and the process was super easy and quick. Thank you so much!< /review>

McCampbell testing was fantastic.  Results arrived way before expected.  Incredibly efficient staff, patient and reassuring of timeline.  All my fears were eliminated.  Thank you so very much.</review>

The website is clear and definitive in every way.  I booked the Same Day service with an 8:50 am appt.  I arrived one hour early and they took me right away.  The staff was courteous and thorough in their explanations.  I got the results 3 hrs later although I wasn't expecting results until 7:00 pm.  It was a long drive for me but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend and use McCampbell again if the need arises.< /Review>< userid>

I was having trouble finding a place in my hometown where I could get a Covid travel test done where I would be guaranteed results back quickly. Everywhere I looked had results back in two days or more. McCampbell Analytical came up as an ad during my search, I was a bit hesitant at first but glad I ended up going with them. Even though I had to drive 1h30 min to get to Pittsburgh I got my results three hours after I had been tested. It was such a big relief and had no trouble at the airport.</review>

I parked in a spot and the test lasted about 5 minutes. I got the results 4 hours later! Price was also great in comparison to other places (150$ for same day results vs 400$ at the covid clinic). Would recommend 100%.<//text>< pictures>

I was travelling international and submitting negative covid test results was mandatory. This place was quite far (close to 60 miles) from where I live. However, I liked that they were willing to provide test results same day or next day. I signed up for next day, paid $180 and showed up at 7:30 am. The specimen collection was easy and relatively painless. Here is the kicker though: received results with 4 hours, on the same day!!! Best $180 I have spent in the recent past. Highly recommend.</text>

Our son  realized he need  2 COVID tests within 2 days to accommodate the differing rules of a 3 day, 3 airline journey to Thailand.  MAI was  flexible, available, reasonable cost, and went out of their way to ensure the final lab report fulfilled the unique requirements of a foreign airline.  They do a wide range of environmental and analytical chemistry as well as COVID testing.   MAI proved to be far superior in customer service and  being able to get a real human on the phone to many regional and national competitors.  We love supporting local businesses, and this is a top-notch lab.< /text>

We ordered the same day tests and even got the results early (around 3pm that same day). They were extremely accommodating and responsive. We told them we needed our passport number listed on the results page, and they answered our email within the hour. When we got our tests, the passports number were right there just like we asked. Highly recommended!<//review>

<text>Talk about under-promise and over-deliver:  American corporations should take a page out of this company's playbook.  We had to take a PCR Covid test for a trip we were taking.  The requirements were very specific as to the timeline.   We paid for a next-day, we showed up at 8:07 am, and there was no wait.  The attendants were very knowledgable and made it really simple.   The results came back same day, 14 hours earlier than promised.  Another covid silver lining!< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) Provide self-paid covid rt-pcr on-site car nasal inspection and testing. Although the price is high, the inspection time and location are not convenient, but the time for the result report can be guaranteed. After the inspection, the report time can be selected from five hours, the same day, the next day, or 2 to 5 days. The shorter the time, the higher the cost.

(Original)
提供自費的 covid rt-pcr 現場車內鼻腔採檢檢測。價格雖然高，採檢時間和地點雖然不太方便，但可以保證結果報告出爐的時間。採檢後報告出爐時間有五小時、當天、隔天、2～5天可以選擇，時間越短、費用越高。<//Text>

I came in a few days ago and petunia took my order. She was super nice and helpful. Usually when I come here the service isn't anything more then average so I was very pleased to come in and get such good customer service. She was informative and was the only one that actually looked like she was happy to be working. The other workers should take some notes 📝<//review>

< review>
This location always marks their food as "ready" when it is not -- I've shown up after seeing that the order was marked ready and was made to wait an additional 30 minutes outside. And recently their food made me so ill that I refuse to ever take a chance on eating there again in the future. I know it's fast food, and so "what do you expect" comes to mind, and you're right -- just go to little coyote , they have the best pizza on 4th.</review>

Exact words "Papa Johns Pizza, we're closed" click. I completely understand were on curfew, and I did not realize what time it was however. Why pick up the phone if the associate was only going to hang up on my face. By far the rudest encounter I've had while calling a place of business. Have a recorded message, let the phone rings, I dotn know. But there has to be a more professional way to deal with late callers like myself. Why bother picking up? Is it a power trip from the associate. Just hanging up on people's faces cus you can. Ugh. We are neighborhood locals, and this is is by far the rudest encounter I've had here. Horrible service by today's associate.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Long wait, and even though I was there first (postmates) and the pizzas were sitting right there(even though I was told there was one more item, there wasn't) 2 others got theirs before me.<//review>

This is by far the single worst pizza store in Long Beach. Delivery takes more than an hour, the food is cold, and the order is marked as delivered before is arrives at the house so you really have no way of knowing if, or when it will arrive. Calling the shop doesn’t help because those that answer the phone there don’t care where your order is. There is never a manager on duty, I’ve been told the manager is only there in the mornings. How has the Papa Johns franchise not shut this store down yet? I guess I’m the idiot that keeps ordering from them, this is the last time I ever will.<//Text>

<text>so we order from this spot about every month; today was probably the worst. I give 2 stars ONLY because the delivery guy is the same guy that usually comes by and he is always nice. I had to call the store 3 times cuz the front of house respondent was rude, inconsistent, n impolite. choose ur cashiers carefully< /text>< pics>

I would give them zero stars if I could. How else do you rate pizza delivery when you place an order and never receive your pizza. After an hour and a half I told them to just forget it.</Review>

They didn't take bills over 20 but the cashier went next door to help us get change. The pizza was great too. Speedy and great service.< /Text>

The staff is always friendly. Their pizza would be awesome except the sauce is inconsistant in flavor and sometimes they glob it on the pizza. I ordered 2 pizzas, both with light sauce. 1 was made with light sauce, the other 1 was not.<//review>

< Review>
WARNING***WARNING***WARNING***AVOID THIS LOCATION
I can't even begin to express my frustration and disgust with this particular franchise location Employees/Customer Service since relocating to LB.  I've been biting my tongue for 3 months thinking something would change but it just continues to get worse!!!  My last 3 experiences calling this location is late evening approx between 10-11pm.  1 of my last 3 calls to this location: I called and began to place a order and was told they did not have TWO out of the 3 items I wanted to order?  REALLY?? The pattern continues to prove my theory that the employees/and or manager just don't give _f@** and are just looking to close up shop ASAP and to avoid doing what they are PAID to do which is answer the phone take the customers order, make it, deliver it and collect the money.  Sounds simple enough to me.  So after I was told they didn't have the food I wanted in stock, I proceeded to call another Papa Johns in the area ( the location I will not reveal to protect them from violating franchise "rules). Told the guy I wanted to place a order and was told they could not deliver to me because I was out of their service area.  I explained to the manager what happen with the 4th Street location and the first thing out of his mouth was...they said they were out of WHAT? How is that possible he said? He said to complain to corporate (which I did and I have still never heard back from ANYONE) he apologized but refused to place my order that evening.  So another week or so goes by and I decide to give it another shot since I had a Craving that I can only full-fill with them..... The same girl just so happens to answers the phone .... the SAME scenario happens AGAIN she tells me they DON"T have it. So AGAIN I called the Papa Johns down the Street and just so happen to get the same manager I spoke to last time, I begged the guy to please deliver to me and I would pay the guy extra (which he politely agreed too)

Perhaps the Pizza monster comes by every night during the week at 10:30pm-11pm and steals all of their food so they can't take anymore orders? What happen to having a business that Closes it's doors when the last customer is served up to 11pm. That means you stop taking orders AFTER 11:01...  That means you should be able to call at 10:45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,11:00pm and still get be able to place an order. Since last time I recall when you work in a fast food restaurant or ANY public retail your still gonna have to spend the next 30 min to 1hr cleaning up, checking inventory and counting the drawer.  Don't tell me your hours are 8-11pm if you stop taking orders at 10:30.  So AGAIN I called late, this time 2 minutes till closing.  A new girl answers the phone.  I tell her I want to place an order and she says Oh we close at 11pm sorry.  I said I called Before 11.  She says well it's 11:01.  I said I was on hold for the last two minutes listening to the damn specials they force you to hear before they answer.  She starts to argue with me and then Hangs up!!  I'm so sorry your pathetic life is working for 8 bucks an hour taking pizza orders but I have done worse jobs in my life and still do it with a smile on my face and I still respect my employers customers with respect and if I thought I might fly off the lid...I do what's right and pass the phone off to the MANAGER to handle.  And if your the manager and can't handle a simple frustrated customer then maybe you need to start looking for a new job QUICK!! I HATE AND DESPISE THE EMPLOYEES/SERVICE FOR THIS LOCATION. AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT QUALITY AND SERVICE.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) They sell food very expensive since the corona virus began. They raised everything and apart they sell the chipilin tamales with cheese very salty.

<Review>Tasty burger and fries, everything was fresh. The burger was served dry so you will need to ask for condiments. They also have an impressive looking bakery with bagle's and donuts. Looks tasty. Lots of outside tables and ample parking.< /Review>< pics>

<Time>1574201922143</Time><text>If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Amazing last minute catering service prepped by Steve in Catering, and then helped to my car by Alan and his staff. I called at 6 am and they had trays ready for me by 10am for a small group I needed a boxed lunch for. Delicious food and delicious fresh fruit. 10/10 and would not hesitate to use them again! You guys are amazing!<//text>< user_name>

<text>This place is close to my workplace and I have tried almost everything from sandwiches and melts. I will recommend all of them, also the Everything and Breakfast bagels are really good. Service is good, some of the servers are pros, some of them need more training :)< /text></record></dataset><record>

My one big criticism of this place are the tables and chairs...they are so uncomfortable! (Patio furniture really). If there was more comfortable seating we definitely come more often with our kiddo. Otherwise, the food is pretty good.</Review>

Lyn's Cafe has been a thorough surprise. The staff is very friendly and courteous, the food is fresh and tasty and homemade. The ambience makes you feel warm and at home. The coffee and apple pie combination is a must do. I visited Lynns for the first time this weekend and was very impressed. Great value, friendly staff, lovely food. Thanks :)<//Review>

Really clean and nice. The displays are appetizing. Eight employees and four customers. It took a long time to make a single wrap. Some workers preparing for the customers that weren't there yet. Some workers talking and eating.
What they were eating looked better than what I ordered...<//Text>

<review>Pretty good. Had the package breakfast combo with French toast. The food came very quick despite the other reviews. Good service, they cleaned the table when we asked to and the girl forgot 1 set of cutlery but it's ok we asked for another. Not bad of a price either< /review>< pics>

Nice, local spot with parking. Went in the everyone when they were cleaning up, for the day. Nevertheless, they were very friendly & helpful. I had a turkey on a pumpernickel bagel, which came with a small side of potato salad and some olives and a pickle, how perfect! My son enjoyed one of the leftover donuts and had no complaints there said it was delicious. I will be back to sample the creators, burritos and coffee.< /Review>

Just discovered this place. It is small but delicious.  There was a bit of a wait but overall faster than other sit-down cafes.  Our group ordered soup and paninnis and they were delicious. Definitely will be adding it to our favorite places.< /Text>

I'm not sure if they are trying to be a restaurant or a coffee house. You have to tip when you order so you just have to predict the service. I predicted incorrectly. The eggs were very overcooked and my waffle was cold. I also wanted butter but thete was nobody to be found to even request it. The bacon was cooked to my liking, however, it tasted microwaved. My son had blueberry pancakes. The berries were fresh,  which he said was very sour. The coffee was delightful. Maybe they should just stick to being a coffee house.<//text>

I adore this place. Yummy sweets and a healthy menu. You can be good.  You can take care of your sweet tooth.  Grab a bagel and coffee. Lot's to choose from. Every person I have interactions with were just as sweet as the cronuts.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>California Eatery Bakery is now open for business. But, I have seen this location converted from Conroy Flowers after many years not in use. The owner have taken their time in completely remodeling this corner to an awesome appearance. Automatic sliding front doors, outside area with counters, outdoor overhead heaters, plenty of ample parking & the inside is new with new see through displays. Plenty of indoor lobby space. The donut are delicious. Other items will have to be tried another time. Fresh coffee, drinks and light sandwiches being served. Great hangout place to view passing cars.</text>< pics>

<Text>I've eaten here now for breakfast and lunch. They seem to be up  running now after a month or so of being open and things are much more smooth than at the start. They no  have music, they call your order over the speakers so you can wait outside at your table, and they have all the things they advertise!

The breakfasts are good and large and reasonably priced. I had the vegetarian farm scramble and the vegetarian mushroom burger and both were great. Might need more inside seating for windy days, but otherwise is a solid 4 stars.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Very trendy and new, but my sandwich was only borderline edible. It was dry, and the lettuce had a foul odor and taste. I normally love tomatoes,  but the one one my sandwich was antique.

I had to pick off the bits that were too far gone to eat.

Avoid this place.<//review>

So... unbelievably.. slow...  Intolerably slow...  I came during off hours on a Saturday afternoon.   There was almost no one in line.   The servers were nice but couldn't take an order to save their lives.   I don't know what the chef was doing but the food... when it finally came out... was still wrong.   They do not separate their peanut (legume) or tree nut pastries from non-nut pastries which is simply shocking in this day and age.  As for the actual food, it's edible. I wasn't impressed but I wasn't disgusted.  This place just opened and I want to give them a growing pains pass... but it'll be a long time before I return again.< /Review>

I'm guessing by other reviews their baked good/breakfast must be what they do well.  I will not return after my first visit.  Ordered a chicken panini that was inedible.  It was accompanied by a wilted salad with a sickly sweet dressing that was also inedible.    I had to sit at a dirty table when there were only two other tables in the place occupied.   Also had to go up to request my iced tea after they forhog that.   So.  Nope.</Text>

<text>Service is slow, and the prices are too high for what you get.  I ordered an egg salad sandwich on rye bread, not toasted.  Sandwich was served on burnt toast.  Egg salad was unseasoned and very bland.  I ate half of the sandwich to give it a chance, but couldn't finish it.  I complained to the server, who was going to tell the manager and see if I could get a refund.  After waiting for 10 minutes and nobody came back to talk to me I just left.  I will not eat there again.  Should have gone to Porto's.<//text>< resp>

You pay to buy a pre made orange juice from the store. Unacceptable!!! People come here because there is less waiting time compared to Porto’s bakery but at least you get fresh pressed orange juice (for cheaper) and great food. Make an effort to walk couple more block and get reel orange juice and food.< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><Pics>None</Pics><Review>I tried a vanilla latte, a cronut and some bagels.

The latte was fantastic with just the right ratio of milk ice and vanilla to make it taste exactly how I like it without having to ask for any modifications.

The cronut was Super yummy although I haven’t had one I didn’t like.I got the glazed one and although it was super yummy as I said, I probably would get the one with white sugar next time for an extra layer of texture and because it’s delicious to eat just straight sugar sometimes.

The bagels were my favorite part because well it was noon the bagels were totally fresh and I got three different flavors so I don’t know if I just hit the right timing but they were perfectly chewy on the inside and had a nice crust (?) on the outside.

Service was 5* even though they were super busy they handled it well and with a smile.

I will agree that the price is a little high however I do think that the superior quality is often worth the price.

I’ll also mention that I like the layout. It’s bright and airy and w lots of windows - my favorite.< /Review>< Rate>

I had a turkey wrap, a little unusual.  I have to give this place another try.  Eat in seating is limited, parking fairly ample.<//review>

<response>None</response><Review>Counter serve restaurant. Place your order, get a number to display, waiters deliver. Really nice servers. The coffee I had was fresh and delish. The burrito was okay, not great. There is very little indoor seating, it's mostly outside, with heaters above every table, but it is still cold, when the wind blows. Everything is served in a styrofoam to-go box. Not a place you want to stay long at, but good for quick meals.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Staff cpuld not be bothered to clean-up the tables -all of them were inside and wondering why I asked for a table to be cleared. My food did not come out and had to prove -above and beyond my receipt- that I was charged. Then the order camed out wrong. Unbelievable. Not coming back here.<//Review>

Every. Single. Item. Was. Wrong. They added cheese to the vegan's burger, sent a turkey wrap when a tuna wrap was ordered, added tomatoes when specifically requested no tomatoes on a wrap, sent a chicken melt instead of a turkey melt, everything was on rye when the menu said it would be on garlic bread. I am SERIOUSLY disappointed. I was charged a $25 service fee for terrible service and I want my money back.</review>

<review>The Service in this placeis good if you are trying to look for a design or fade, which will cost around $25 or more.Although, you have to make an appointment to make sure you get your cut on time, or else you'd be sitting in the chair for a while. Overall, the environment is socially friendly and the barbers are great</review><pics>None</pics></record>

I honestly have seen every barber in this shop cut hair and they are ALL AWESOME! I personally take my son to Jessie. He is so good with my kid. He always makes him laugh and they are so comfortable with each other. Jessie always hooks my son up and always makes sure he leaves out that door looking fly as ever (smelling good too). Jessie makes every effort to get my son in even when it may be last minute. He is definitely appreciated. The vibe throughout the shop is so welcoming and friendly as well. Jessie, you’re the man!<//text>

<Review>Located a little off the beaten path, you'll find people in the shop that are welcoming, respectfull and classy.  I brought my two sons for a much needed cut and for the first time ever they didn't scream or cry while getting there cut.  The wait time was reasonable (20 min) and the staff was atentive to the needs of the person in the chair, as well as the individuals waiting.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpSaBR8NNpxf1UXokukJH3bNF6-YN7u2iF_89H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMs3u94RWFHihdRgQHqCJVBLXgd7M2IW2iUYGE7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Super awesome! Love the hair cuts every time. Jessie does a great job. He is patient, kind and takes pride in his work. Everyone is cool. My son has a great time hanging with the guys. The barbers have conversation on his level making him laugh and sometimes think. After searching and searching me and my young one have finally found a GREAT barber and barbershop.<//Review>

<review>I asked for a fade, trim on the top and two lines on the side and the barber who cut my hair was named Edgar he basically cut all my hair off and didn’t even get me the two lines that I asked for on the side, my hair ends up looking like a military cut I am so angry and upset, if you go their do not let Edgar cut your hair because honestly he did not listen to anything I said, let’s just say I would of rather went to Fantastic Sams then letting Edgar at One love barber cut my hair. Felt like I just trashed 25 dollars down the drain for this haircut, and when he was cutting my hair half of the time he would just talk to a customer and not even look where he was cutting, it any possible way I think the barbershop would be way better without him because the other barbers looked professional and focused on their clients.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dca6e1588738b7:0xa65b622abc318a71<//Gmap_id></record>

Enjoy bringing my 8 year old son to this shop. The vibe is positive, fun and relaxing.
All of the barbers are highly skilled in their craft, passionate and strive for excellence in each and every customer they service. I respect that and demonstrate my appreciation.

<Review>Don’t go here if you don’t have an appointment. Waited 3hrs and still didn’t get cut. My son experience the same thing before also. The barbers don’t say anything to let you know where you are in line, they just keep taking in people and say they had an appointment<//Review>< pictures>

<text>First time and it won't be the last. I love new relationships. All the barbers were great. But my friend has his hair cut by Ty so that's who I asked for. Ty is great. With very little direction he gave my teen a great cut. My son is happy with his cut and so are we.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Time>

Professional and friendly atmosphere. I was having a difficult time finding a place that would do a good job on my daughter's undercut and I found that in, One Love Barber Shop. Marty did an awesome job with giving my daughter the haircut she wanted as well as making her feel comfortable. Jay is awesome with children.  Everyone in the shop just seems to make customers feel comfortable. I loved this place.<//Review>

<text>My son got a hair cut from jesse, and when I tell you my son didn’t cry not one time, he works really well with little children my son has no patience and this was his first experience at a barber shop 💈 so I was Surprised he was able to keep him calm, I love the haircut I definitely will be coming back and this will definitely be my sons regular barber. Also he is pretty quick with the cuts, I was in and out. So it all work out for us 😊, i really thought my son was gonna cry, im so happy.< /text><rate>5<//rate>< Name>

<text>I had to take my nephew last minute due to school starting tomorrow it was hard to look for a barber shop that had good reviews. Except this one in particular so I decided to try it out, and no regrets !!! I loved the work and so did he. He is a peeky lil gal so I was a bit nervous about it. I felt welcomed and the men there were very polite, great atmosphere! I highly recommend and will continue to go there.< /text><resp>None< /resp>< Pictures>

< Review>
My husband had a haircut yesterday by Jessie and I loved it! Came back today and brought our son to Jessie and we basically told him to suprise us since we didn't really know what kind of haircut our 8 year old wanted. It came out perfect! He did a combover even with his short hair and just wow! We just moved into the area recently and we will definitely come back and make this our permanent barber. It is clean, the guys are great and respectful. If I ever decide to chop off my hair I will come here😁With Jessie! Gets a little busy in the weekend but they are great with appointments and worth the wait. You won't be disappointed..< /Review>

Went to the barbershop my first time...got my hair cut by Jessie..I asked him for a specific cut..but because the music was loud and he wasnt paying full attention to how I wanted my hair cut...he gave me something totally different then what I asked for...I’m very disappointed and the service at this place..the wait was very long and on top of that I didn’t get the cut I asked for..never going back to this place again<//Review>

Very,  very, very poor service,  the worst f'n place ever!!    -10  if your not of a certain ethnicity.  They should put a sign if your not black we won't cut your hair!!!! waited hour and half,  and still didn't get a haircut.  Keeped blowing you off,  said needed an appointment. Why didn't they say that as soon as you walk in. Never going back ever and will never refer them to anyone.< /review>

This is more of a "locals" place. It accepts pets and kids too but mainly its more of an adult atmosphere so just be forwarded. It has undergone some slight renovations and is currently under new management.< /Text>

< Review>
The owner is foul-tempered and extraordinarily rude. Acts like you're putting him out by checking in. Room was moldy and unpleasant, with no hot water and weak shower stream. Sketchy characters are all around, people who pay by the week or month. And the walls are paper-thin -- did *not* get a good night's sleep here. Not recommended at all.<//Review>

<review>All of Eureka was booked and this motel had a vacancy.  I was halfway through the process of renting a room when a group of guys walked  up behind me wanting a room as well. The manager behind the window said they had 2 rooms and that one was the handicap room. I said that the handicap room would be perfect for me as I have a service animal.  Suddenly the guy behind the window points to his no pets sign. I made it clear that my dog is not a pet but a registered service animal.  The guy  then tells me his motel has a policy of only allowing five service animals on the property and we already have five.  I started to protest and the guys behind me steps up to the window and tells him that he has taken four years of law school and it is illegal for him to not rent me a room due to a service animal.  The guy still refuses to rent me a room and then says "We don't have any room available"  and starts putting his board back into the night window area.  I asked for a business card so I can file a complaint with his manager and he says he is the manager, refuses to give me anything. As I walk to my blazer the guy behind me walks ove to my vehicle and tells my boyfriend what happened.   As I said before, every other motel in Eureka was booked.  That night my boyfriend and I had to sleep in our vehicle with my service dog due to this mans discrimination of me. The next morning, we see the same group of guys walking off of a trail near the beach. They had slept on the side of the road as there were three of them and could not sleep in their car.  Really said that not only was I refused a room because I had  a service animal, but they were refused a room for trying to stand up for my rights.  I will never stay at this motel and if you have and I do not think that anyone else should either if this is how they treat the disabled.< /review>< Pictures>

Best monthly motel rates in Eureka, but wouldn't stay there again unless I absolutely needed to. Roaches way out of control even with the exterminator coming by monthly and bed bugs were also out of control. But being a low budget motel I guess it is to be expected.< /text>

<text>I don't know where to start. I'm considering taking some form of preventive action as a concerned and violated visitor of this awful place.The management not only made me feel deeply offended as a women but also as a human being in general. I feel like crying. The room I stayed in was filthy, and I couldn't get rest due to the noise from the property. NO housekeeping is offered, no surprise. At one point a cockroach literally crawled across my face while I slept. The owner was so nasty to me and difficult to understand and just an unpleasant person. This man should not be allowed to run a business. Please don't stay in this terrible unsafe place. I will never forget the treatment received by the immoral and unfit low lifes who run this disaster.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<response>None< /response><review>I tried to call to find out whether they use scented detergent and fabric softener on their linens and everything else, and the guy that answered the phone answered with a simple hello that sounded agitated. I had to ask whether or not I even reached a hotel. Then when I asked whether they used scented detergent and fabric softener, he said he didn't know, but I had to ask several times because I couldn't understand his answer, so I asked if he could find out, then it sort of sounded like he said that he'd find out, and then he just hung up the phone.

So I called back, and this time he tried to say the name of the hotel but I really couldn't understand anything he said, it was worse than reaching customer service in India. So I said that I had just called to find out whether they use scented detergent and fabric softener and he mumbled something rather long, I couldn't even understand a single word of it. He sounded very agitated.

I've never understood why any business would hire someone who nobody can understand as the primary person to handle customer relations, but when you put on top of it extreme rudeness, it's just not a business I care to go to.<//review>< username>

This is a hell hole! Stains everywhere in the room carpet is nasty NO HOT WATER!! the best I could get was luke warm WTF!!! Black mould everywhere in the bathroom. Dope heads knocking on my door and calling on the phone looking for some chick that I don't know!!! The wifi works good but this place should be shut down and condemned! People yelling and stomping a round in the rooms next to me some of them work here. Homeless freak show in the back alley. When the small parking lot in front is full DO NOT park in the back!< /Text>

< review>
This place *used* to be decent back in 2005, but since then it's turned into almost as sleazy a motel as the Budget Inn in back of it. Most of the rooms are weeklies for welfare kings and queens and drug dealers. The rooms are dirty and smell, the noise coming from the other rooms is deafening, and trying to sleep is a chore because of all the loud tenants who talk loudly outside their rooms. Back in 2005 the majority of the guests were overnighters, but since the Royal Inn started taking all the drug fiends who can't find room at the Budget Inn the quality has greatly nosedived.</review>

The only reason i gave a star is so i could worn people about this place,it is the most disgusting place i have ever stayed. First the guy was very rude,telling us that we had to pay extra for two beds because we have a 9 month baby
(that shares a bed with us),the room smelts bad,the shower curtain was moldy,after we packed our stuff in the room i watched the guy running the place clean a room with a filthy mop and trash can,didnt see any real cleaning supplys. after the sun went down the parking lot filled with creepy nasty people. Then to top it off,as i was getting the baby to sleep we see two cockroaches crawling down the wall.needless to say we slept in our car instead of staying another second in that dump.
No wounder this was the only place in three towns with rooms available. needs to be stut down asap.< /text>

<Text>Theres no better place then floor and decor to get everything you need for your remodeling needs. I bought amazing wood tiles at such an unreal bargain. No one can beat their prices. Come on 75cents for wood tiles! I also bought travertine natural stone at an unbelievable bargain as well.My favorite place to go now< /Text><userid>102036891200481519655</userid>< name>

<Text>Was pressured and to buying flooring and plastic when we went to pay they didn't have change in the store so they wanted us to donate our change we actually took everything back and they wanted to charge a 10% restock fee we could not get a refund they had to put it on a debit card or a corporate check we actually bought a flooring at Sam's Club and are very happy with our purchase we were not pressured and they actually gave change back that was owed to us with no restock fee< /Text>< pictures>

Yoshinoya is wonderful and the food is very tasty, it's just sad that there are so many empty or under used space there.   A grocery store would be ideal for the location and help bring in more business to the area.<//review>

Yoshinoya, basically has a limited menu, and what I mean by this is they're not like a restaurant where you get a wide variety of different dishes. This is not a bad thing because what ever food item you order from their menu is well cooked and very tasty.  Sometimes you get tired of pizza and burgers and hotdogs and you want something different, so if you're tired of the same old fast foods then come on down to Yoshinoya and enjoy food that is not only tasty but good for you.  It's located on the same lot is the IHOP restaurant. Cross streets are heacock and hemlock in Moreno Valley.  Yoshinoya is not a real large place but it has enough seating for a group of people.  The atmosphere it's nice and quiet and the staff are very friendly.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>In an area that's pretty expensive, this place is a gem of affordability. They have the best selection of beer and liquor including top shelf bottles and craft beers, all reasonably priced. They also have a great deli counter. Sandwiches run 7 to 9 dollars and for just 2 dollars more you get double the sandwich!! I highly recommend this place if you're visiting or a local.<//Review>< pics>

Ordered a BLT and it was fantastic.  The ratio of bacon to bread to lettuce & tomato and Mayo were perfectly proportioned.  Best BLT Ever!!  I’d go back for another.<//Review>

<review>Poor customer service. But the turkey sandwhich had fresh ingredients. I told the cashier that I had a Turkey sandwhich and then he asked his colleague, what did he order, basically implying that I lied to him (and his colleague confirmed with him it was a Turkey sandwhich)?  Didn't smile or apologize to me. It was a $10 transaction. Why would I care to lie about that. Won't be going back. Based on the positive reviews left on this review board, not sure why he was so rude to me.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dc0ed5692a85f3:0x2416d21d7f44a1d7</gmapID></record>

<review>I love shopping at Qwik-Korner Deli-Grocery. Even though the quality of food is somewhat below Whole Foods you pay only half the price. The people who work there are always fun and very helpful. Especially in the evenings it is getting a bit crowded but other than that I always had pleasant shopping experiences.</review>< rate>

I found my car rental through T-Mobile Tuesdays app.  I was able to rent a Hyundai car at a 40% discount.  When we arrived at the airport, looking for the rental place, they had a shuttle outside.  The guy was very courteous and professional.  When we got to the office, they were able to upgrade us to the Ford Mustang Convertible.  It was a reasonable upgrade fee.  I was VERY happy with SNA's service.  When we turned the car in, they were kind enough to take us by shuttle, back to the airport.  I highly recommend.</text>

< review>
I have photographic evidence of a fairly well damaged car and specifically a broken windshield and damaged roof, door, hood, tailgate, etc. They took my deposit to pay for an already damaged windshield. The employee who answered my phone call denies any knowledge of having rented a can to my girlfriend and me, and proceeded to yell profanities at me. I've never experienced an employee acting that unprofessional on the job - anywhere. I am also highly suspicious that all of these other reviews are fraudulent. There exists software to alter one's outbound IP address, which will allow someone to repeatedly post reviews on one's own business or someone else's.<//review>

Amazing family run car rental! My family and I have had hard times for transportation and these guys have gone above and beyond in making sure we get what we need with fair prices! This is also the FIRST car rental agency that I've does NOT take your whole deposit, they give pretty much all of it back unless of course there are some interior or exterior issues that you brought the car back with, even then still give back a fair amount of your deposit! Great guys, would highly recommend!< /text>

SNA Auto Rental was personable, friendly, and worked with us to make a trip to CA during a pandemic feel safe and manageable. We even had to shift plans a couple times, but they worked with me from start to finish. I loved supporting this local business and hope to use them again in the future!<//Text>

<Review>I rented a compact car for a day to get out of Orange County. The price was half the cost from the national rental companies. The car was brand new but  all of the cars in the garage were clean and very recent models. Brandon was most professional and full of helpful information.  This is a must do if looking for a rental.  They do it right.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We had a great experience with SNA Auto Rental. Friendly service, no coercion about insurance, pick up and drop off from the airport and local area. We accidentally left something in the car after we were dropped off at the airport and they found it for us and brought it to us right away, very graciously. When I was initially researching rental companies I was wary of all the positive reviews from people that have only written one or two reviews. Perhaps, like me, they had such a good experience they thought it was worth taking the time to review a small business that does things well.< /Text>< pictures>

Had a great experience. Definitely the most affordable rental car I’ve seen. The people are nice as well as the car I rented. The only cons I see are first that there is a mileage restriction of 200miles/day. Second because it’s local you can’t return to a different location. Otherwise I had a great experience, it’s especially nice they offer a shuttle to and from the airport.</text>

<text>This is by far the best rental car agency I've ever worked with.  They picked me up from the the airport in a matter of minutes and took me to their office where my clean car was waiting.  I had to catch an early flight out, so they allowed me drive the car to the airport and park it in the self parking lot.  Talk about a time saver!!  The employees are professional and I would highly recommend SNA Auto Rentals!  What a great experience.</text><gmapID>0x80dcdef84648db8b:0x9d82da59b780eb3e< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We needed a rental car at the last minute, and this was the only business with cars available. I’ve had bad to mediocre experiences with independent rental companies in the past, so I was surprised that SNA Auto Rental had so many five-star reviews. They lived up to their reputation throughout the entire experience! The shuttle had us picked up and signing paperwork in five minutes, and paperwork signing consisted of just signing with no foreboding sales pitch about the horrors of not purchasing liability insurance and other such annoyances you get with the large companies. We were given the car we requested, and our bags were even transferred to it when we walked out. Car return was just as simple. The only downside was that the rental was limited in mileage, but we came nowhere near that. Great experience and solid business. I’ll definitely be back.</text>

<Text>Fast, friendly and professional! Needed a car for a last minute trip, had the car in-hand and ready to go within 30 min of calling. The car was freshly washed in excellent condition. Great performance, zero issues. Drop off was even easier. Just parked the car and slipped keys through the slot. Doesn't get any easier

We recommend going here for car rental. From other reviews we were put off by rental companies in the airport. SNA was fantastic. We arrived early, called them for pick up, they were there by the time we walked outside. Van was clean and drove great. Check in was easy and painless, we were ready to go in 5 min. Return was painless, it was while they were closed. We parked the van at the airport in a paid parking spot, called it in. Highly, highly recommended SNA!!<//Review>

My wife & I have rented from SNA 3 years now (every October Grand parents Day week).

From the start, the service has been a pleasant surprise.

On arrival, they picked us up in the "Transportation hub" area in 5 minutes after we called from the luggage pick up area.

Since I am somewhat a walking handicap, I appreciate the less walking distance I have to do vs. the on-site rental companies check in process.

Return is very efficient too.

The big benefit we received is that when we return the car to SNA, they take us, in the car being returned, right to the proper airlines departure terminal and unload the luggage right there.

Again, this means a quicker, less walking, check-in. So very convenient.
Even if the auto rental rates were higher (in reality, they seem to be less), we will continue to go with SNA because of their service.

PS.  A small caution... SNA is not a 24 hour company.
If you need to return a rental before 7AM, the return process is different. You will return the car to one of the short term parking garages and call SNA to tell them where it is parked. An early, before daily business open time, eliminates the normally convenient return process.

PPS. Another small caution... the cars that we rented were clean and functioned well but were not up to the "newness" that the Hertz, Avis, types rent.<//Text>

Being our first time flying we were super stressed and confused on how to even get around the airport never the less to a rental car facility and how it was suppose to done. I called SNA asking if we needed to have a reservation to be picked up from the airport or how it all worked. The owner was beyond helpful said they preferred reservations but he would be by to get us. He directed us to where we needed to go in order for us to be picked up and all the paperwork could be done once we arrived to the office. We rented a 2017 Toyota for a total of 7 days and the rates where way cheaper than what we where expecting! the car ran great had a touch screen system a camera for when you backed up great AC and drove great. They even drop you off @ the airport in the same car you rent so you don't have to be packing and unpacking into their Van, We couldn't be more pleased with the service! Definitely recommend them. Thank you SNA Auto Rental!< /Text>< response>

does not charge more if you are under 25! Hard to find a company that does this!

Picked us up from the airport after another rental company decided that they wouldn’t honor their original quoted price and was going to charge a lot ($210) more. Super friendly people and very good rates. Car was a newer Hyundai and my girlfriend and I had absolutely no complaints. Best part was when you return the car they drive you right back to the airport in your rental car so no need to transfer bags or anything. Can’t say enough good things about them and will definitely recommend and use them again! SNA if you are reading this thank you for providing such great service and thanks for making our trip to Cali go smoothly!< /Text>

The employees at SNA Auto Rental are fabulous.  They are very close to the airport.  We were picked up quickly and on our way much sooner than with other rental companies I have used.  They were very affordable and the vans were clean and in good working condition.  We will definately use them again.  Thank you!<//text>

Great service! I was visiting the US for work and had to travel from Costa Mesa to Palm Desert for a conference and decided to hire a convertible Mustang (always wanted to from a young age). The customer service was great, very friendly and helpful. The car was immaculate and in great condition and when I came to return the car a couple of hours earlier than expected someone was there in mins to assist, and also gave me a lift back to my office. The price was also great so I would highly recommend and will definitely use again when I return for work! Thank you!</Review>

<review>The did not have the mini van that I had reserved and upgraded us to a bigger van. It was great. Super friendly and right next to the airport. They picked up our family and took us back to the rental office and packed us up in the van. Upon returning the car the took us back and dropped us off at the door. I was a little leery when I made the reservations because they prices were so much better than the national companies. Nothing to worry about. I will be sure to recommend them and use them again!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcdef84648db8b:0x9d82da59b780eb3e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Worked out very well.  We rented a BMW.  Friendly service, picked us up at the airport, the office & car were very close and we were on our way quickly and efficiently.  Upon return, our check out was very quick as well and we were immediately returned to the airport.  No issues, no wait, ALL good!</Text>

<text>A little car rental place that worked out just fine for my family.  The rates were the lowest I could find.  After arriving I called for a free shuttle ride to their office which is less than a mile away.  No extra fees or nonsense other car rental places sometimes engage in.  On return they drove us back to the airport promptly.  I would return and recommend them in the future.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>If you want a non-large-chain, local and good company, SNA is great!  I had last minute chance to head up into central LA to meet someone.  I basically walked into their office (naturally pre-booking would be better if circumstances permit) - the guy was great - casual & friendly but professional (I saw they are BBB accredited as well), I got a Corolla & GPS, & returned it.   All went fine - very good price & car, great people.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

So easy, and helpful. My car broke down and I made a reservation at Enterprise. Due to being at the mechanics I wasn't going to make it on time to the Enterprise, they transferred my reservation over to the Airport Enterprise, but it was going to be over DOUBLE the price. I cancelled it, and quickly did some research, finding SNA. Easy, cheap, car was in good condition, friendly. I would absolutely recommend SNA if you are visiting Orange County, or you are a local!</text>

<review>I rented a Sienna for a family trip to Vegas. The guys in the office were great and the van was top notch. I wish they gave more miles per day, but it wasn't a big issue. I would definitely rent from them again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Having been recently disappointed by a large chain I thought I would try a small one.  Great service, friendly, fast pick up and quickly on the road.  They included the GPS.
Will for sure use them again!</Text>

No weird fees, all right and fair, it took us less than 10 minutes to be on our way and  less than 5 when we return the car, I won't even look for another company next time, I am surely pleased, and even got a free upgrade, that's the kind of service the other big name companies need, but don't have.
Kudos to them, I will definitively rent from them again and again and again and again....< /text>

Very impressed with the rate, being much lower than the national brands, and the service. Usually like the peace of mind of a national but this experience changed my mind.
Toyota Sienna was a great rental.< /Text>

We were ecstatic to use SNA Auto Rental while down in the OC.  Both Kelly and Mo were outstanding,   super professional,  and were accommodating.  We will definitely have no qualms whatsoever using this company again ..    very reasonable rates,  top notch cars, and pick up and drop off service right at SNA.   Everything that the fantastic reviews say and more!   We'll definitely use this company again each time that we fly down to the OC!  Looking forward already to our next trip down!< /review>

<Response>None< /Response><pics>None</pics><review>Great service and price. They had me picked up from the airport within 10 minutes of calling them. The car was parked out front and ready to go even though I arrived an hour early. Did a walk through and they marked all the dents unlike other agencies to make sure I wouldn't get charged for someone else's mistakes. They showed me all of the features on the car which was appreciated. Also for the price they can't be beat especially if you are 22 and want to drive a Mustang. That was another highlight, I booked a Mustang and got one whereas other places will switch it with a sebring/200. Overall great experience.<//review><gmapID>0x80dcdef84648db8b:0x9d82da59b780eb3e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I flew in from Houston, Texas for a tour to Las Vegas - Grand Canyon on 12/27/15 and rented a mid size SUV from SNA Auto Rental from 12/23/14 -- 12/26/14. During this peak period, the rental rate was really high at those big car rental companies such as Hertz, Enterprise, Avis, Thrifty, ...but I got a very good deal from SNA. Pickup was very fast and the car was great!  I asked if I could return the car late on the 26th, at about 10:00pm. They let me do it without even an extra charge. It is such a great company! It's hard to find such a nice car rental company like this one. From now on, whenever I have a chance to get to Los Angeles, SNA Auto Rental would be the place for me to rent a car.

Thank you.

<Review>Horrible service. Rude employees. Always something wrong or missing with drive through orders. There are 2 other locations in town I would highly recommend over this one. The drive across the street is well worth it for better service and better food.< /Review><time>1620567143743< /time>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The food was fine, but the service was slow. Although I waited patiently for my number to be called,  it never was. When all the numbers before and after mine were finished, I went asking for mine. It was sitting there, ready. Just forgotten.<//Review>< user>

Horrible.  The service was bad and I was charged for a kids meal which I never received.  Los Banos customer service is the worst I have ever experienced in my life.<//Text>

And I'll just too much you could say about McDonald's it speaks for itself but the service is great the food is good and they're pretty consistent as far as taking your order correctly and getting all your food to you I gave it a five stars lip service.<//Text>

<Text>This is the 4th time coming here in the past year and their hours listed online and what hours they actually are open are always different. This is the managers and owners of this franchises fault as it is their responsibility to update their business's hours of operation. Why do you think business post that info anyway? For their customers....if a business cant get their own hours of operation correct maybe they shouldn't be in business<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Worst McDonald experience I ever had. The exterior lights off should have told me something.
Ice cream was frozen (not creamy). One of the 2 ice creams was very small.
The salse in one of McChicken had a weird flavor and was not very warm.
The french fries did not have any salt.
I asked for mayo packages I received a bunch of mayo squirted in a mcnugget package.
I ordered at the kiosk but I could not pay there.< /Review>

I went here at midnight and they are remodeling. The employee that was helping me didn't really care that I was calling him 7+ times for something, he sat there talking to fellow employees as I am trying to get his attention. When I finally got my food, he had to get my drink I had asked for. I believe he was off the clock and got irritated at me for him not doing his job. 🤷</text>

<Text>Asked 3 different people in all 3 occasions of interactions for extra sauces with my meal, got reassured everything was in bags. Get home, no sauces whatsoever (which I paid the extra fee for) and all my fries and burgers were cold. The manager was nice when I called but food was garbage. I already don't like McDonald's and don't care about the 2 dollars I paid for my sauce I didn't get its the fact that I asked 3 times and it got ignored 3 times and I would have paid double for my food to have been warmer than room temperature.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>One of the worst McDonald's I have ever been in. There is bugs everywhere, The Glass shield are not clean and they can't even get the order right. When we apply our coupon they don't even understand. I believe headquarter needs to someone to investigate this location. Not only they don't get the order correct. They laugh about it and while we have to wait for them to get the order correct all the other food is cold. We are a family of Six its should not be that hard to get six meals correctly. Also they never give you any sauces and if they do they only give you one. and try to charge you extra for it. Then you should have mentioned that at the payment check out spot. Please revise your company and Make Mc. Donald Great again.</Text>< pictures>

Dude, I ordered the Large Combo meal. The fry box I got was large, but was basically empty. This is one of the main reasons I go to Mc Donalds. Why so stingy with the fries. Why am I paying for a large, and getting a medium????
Not happy!<//Review>

<Text>Cash register employees are always rude and always give me the wrong order . They ask for the wrong food back even thought it has been opened and touched hopefully they don’t give it back out to another person . Not the best McDonald’s to go to best one is by Walmart fast service and gets your order right .</Text><Time>1616708450861</Time>< username>

I go here every morning and I sometimes get bad service. Sometimes the people are a little rude. I get it not everyone had a great morning but tell me thank you for your visit or something. Sometimes they don't say anything when they hand your stuff to you.< /Text>

I've posted many times for McDonald's. It's okay. Or someone with not much money it will get you by. I usually get the chicken sandwich for a dollar 59. Tastes like a piece of foam. Not sure if it's even chicken LOL but it tastes okay</text>

Not a very good fast food resturant. For the 4th time I have come here, i never got all my orders or food, would have to come back to the store to get the rest and go home  and eat very cold food and fries. came back last time and the guy was like oh i forgot to make your flurries and laughed about it, like it was no big deal.< /Review>

For years the McDonald's store located on Mercey Springs Road, Los Banos CA always gets my order wrong. I was charged for an item that I DIDN'T ORDER & I mentioned this to the night manager (9:30 p.m - 9 Marc 2020) who didn't actually correct the matter. I mentioned to her her FOR YEARS that this McDonald's store always doesn't get my order correct. She then stated to me' "since you have problem with this store and no one is perfect you can drive to the end of town to order your food there". I was not amused by her answer. This wasn't awesome customer service expectation that I expected normally from a McDonald's manager. I did mention to her that I am a competent business owner who owns a legal business and would never inform a customer to go to another location. I also mentioned that I have many years of customer service experience too. I would have a meeting or training to correct the matter. This night manager stated her supervisor informed her to say that comment whenever a customer showed dissatisfaction with something not correct. Actually I felt as if I was being mocked by her comment. I did own up to my part in the order believing that my order was correct without looking at my receipt. I gave up talking to her as I felt it wasn't anywhere. Still this manager didn't apologize for the incorrect order charged on my card and she didn't return any money. I mentioned to this manager that I'm sharing my experience with McDonald's corporation. She didn't show she cared.
One last thing. As I walked away she and 2 employees began to laugh loudly as if the situation was an amusement to them. Wow. Very unprofessional. As it is, I rarely ever eat at McDonald's and mentioned to the manager that I I gave the store another opportunity to redeem itself by returning to the store in hopes this time they get my order correct. 🙅🏻 Nope. Not again. Siiigh. This has been going on at this store fore years. I'm not the only customer who's mentioned this problem!!!
They need TRAINING AND TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER WALKS AWAY FEELING POSITIVE - the customer should never feel mocked, etc. AND I believe McDonald's employees should not tell their customers to go somewhere else if they have a problem. Wow. I'm 50 yrs old and I remember as a child McDonald's was always known for customer service and a big 😃 smile with no negative personality issues... With the customer feeling confident and happy being there. No longer those days. Very disappointed 💔😞!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Text>

<review>God awful. Dont ever try the fraps there, it tastes like they never cleaned the machine, used outdated ingredients, and added literal garbage. I got a simple order, a sausage egg mcmuffin and a hashbrown, and there were no POTATOES in the hashbrown. How do you manage to have no potatoes in a hashbrown?? It was all just the outer skin and it was WAY too crispy to the point it was unedible.<//review>< Pictures>

Clean and rapid service.  Good topical breakfast food items.   Always hot and tasty for fast food.  Parking area is small.  There are two handicap parking spaces.</Review>

As many are probably aware, McDonald’s is putting out a very decent menu these days. Sure, l get that it’s fast food, but this site made it the way I like it. Affordable and quick... and the cookies were tasty!<//Review>

Fast service at curbside. Hard English muffinI couldn't chew it. Everything else was fine. Hopefully they have new management soon. Last curbside experience was 20 min and they never showed. Had to go in and they still got it wrong.< /text>

<text>As a former Mcdonald’s employee myself,  I come to the city to do my errands. Every time I go to this place, the crew workers seem to be okay but the managers give me this rude and disrespectful look whenever I go in and order something. One time one of my orders was about to be taken by one of the crew members, until the manager told him to stay on drive thru thus ignoring me. A couple minutes later a friendly worker took my order which I really appreciated. As for the managers, next time I go in there, if continued with their disrespectful faces and negligence, I’m going to record them and report to the corporation to show how they represent the community with their ignorance.</text>< user>

I just stopped here for a Coke and a restroom break.  The people were friendly, but the men's restroom was flooded and the regular Coca-Cola had a distinctly cherry taste to it.  These seem like very basic things to get right. Hopefully I just caught them on a bad day.</text>

Super badly cooked nuggets. Normally you can count on McDs to get decent quality fast food and this time we ordered 1-big mac, 1-hamburger+fries, 1-20 piece nuggets. The nuggets looked over cooked or cooked twice....they were dry and rubbery. The Big mac was served on a stale bun. Tryed to call them on the phone and it rings once and disconnects.</review>

Service was quick and when i ordered the cashier was attentive to my order which was exactly how i ordered it. Also restrooms were clean to use. Dining area was clean as well and quite comfortable for us to dine here. I was accommodated with a good amount of sauces for my meal. Asked for a water cup and was given one without any questioning so i appreciate that very much. Overall my experience here was five stars and i left satisfied and had an economic & fulfilling meal for less than $4! I will come back here when im in town.< /Text>

I went there at 1:29am to get a bite to eat because online it said that this McDonald’s closes at 2am . Well yeah funny story is that I waited 10min and no answer but yet the employees were chit chatting not paying attention there’s a customer in the drive through!!! Like serious I worked in a fast food joint before, it’s not that hard to detect when there’s a customer. If a manager is reading this, check your cameras between 1:20am inside and outside of the drive through til 1:35am. Very poor service. I wish I can give 0 stars to you guys. Your employs just don’t care about your customers.<//Text>

They made us a big order, and got it wrong, put cheese on all our burgers, so we went back told the person in charge and when we came back, and since we didn't have our receipt, they told us that will not be able to refill the order. They only had given us a half the order right, due to the fact that it was the rule<//text>

I went to 3 yesterday.  One in Monterey...it was very busy, they give you a number to set on your table and bring your food to you. I was disappointed because they didn't offer spicy chicken sandwiches. Same at the one in Prunedale. But Prunedales chicken nuggets were hot and crunchy. Good! Now the one in Los Banos has the Spicy Chicken sandwiches and they are delicious!! One more thing about the Monterey McDonald's...I got a filet 'o fish and they only put a half of slice of cheese on it!  Adding insult to injury in my mind because the piece of fish is so small anyway- maybe 2/3 the size of the bun so you're eating lots of bread.  Come on McDonald's!  For $4.79 that piece of fish should be as big as the bun!!!  With a whole slice of cheese!</Text>

Really really slow service in drive through, supposed to be fast but it’s slow as a freaking turtle. The drive through guy asked us for the receipt for freaking straws ?? 25 freaking minutes in the drive through it’s ridiculous. Get some better management!</text>

I always stop at this Mc Donald’s when I drive back and fourth from San Jose. I usually will just order some coffee and each time, it’s been pretty consistent. Not a lot of complaints and it’s easy to get on and off the main road from this location. Although, one time it was tee-peed and they didn’t clean it up and this was at 8:30pm. So bizarre. It’s a Mc Donald’s, I don’t expect anything outstanding from this place but I’ve never had an issue.< /Review>

<Review>I always stop at this Mc Donald’s when I drive back and fourth from San Jose. I usually will just order some coffee and each time, it’s been pretty consistent. Not a lot of complaints and it’s easy to get on and off the main road from this location. Although, one time it was tee-peed and they didn’t clean it up and this was at 8:30pm. So bizarre. It’s a Mc Donald’s, I don’t expect anything outstanding from this place but I’ve never had an issue.<//Review>< user_id>

How can you go wrong with a Big Mac with extra sauce large fry and a Coke? You can't unless they don't put any lettuce or sauce which only happened one time in Los Banos in front of Save Mart. LOL. Got to love them Big Macs. The only thing better than a Big Mac is the Grand Mac that they had for a short time. Come on McDonald's bring back the grand Mac.< /Review>

I went through the drive thru today 3/20/19 at 11:50 am. Store was slow I was the only car on drive thru and I requested my sausage egg Mcmuffin to be fresh. I also ordered a medium size Caramel Mocha. Total was almost $8 and when I got to the second window I got my food quick and thought to myself the employees were too quick to prepare me a fresh Sausage Mcmuffin?.... When I was driving back home I took a bite out of my sausage egg Mcmuffin and it was NOT fresh! I took a sip out of my caramel Mocha and it was cold! Definetly am not going back to this restaurant even if I'm starving! That was a waste of my $8 that I could've spend on any other FRESH decent food. This restaurant disappointed me.<//Text>

<username>JANNETTE VALDEZ WITTEN<//username><review>I can only describe my experience as the worst ever. They don't care here though because being located on a main thoroughfare they'll always have business. So many flies and extremely dirty restaurant! You have to place your order with unprofessional and impolite staff. Food suck but the coffee is good and strong is the only plus. I've tried a couple of times and each time was same.<//review>< resp>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>I’ve been here several times thru drive thru. The manager in the mornings is super rude. He is always wearing a grey shirt, male, Hispanic. You ask for items and he looks at you with a dirty face.  Like seriously!!! He forgot the bbq sauce for the chicken nuggets so I asked nicely and he said it was in there. I responded that I had checked and it wasn’t in the bag. He rolled his eyes and gave it to me. Another day he forgot my apple pies and my yoghurt. Which he had offered to me while placing my order. His attitude is the worst. Hey if you don’t like your job then quit!!  Other employees are nice and polite but he should  be an example not a complete JERK!!!< /Text><Date>1545980733937</Date><name>Anna DLT18< /name>< pictures>

Went above and beyond when I was told they didn’t carry a artisan sandwich anymore and they did.  Wasn’t anyone’s fault except too many.chicken sandwiches and I confused order t well what I wanted. I got the artisan bbq sandwich !👏🏻  Great service just by manager/owner overhearing and making sure I got the right one! Awesome!< /Review>

Got to love them Big Macs. The only thing better than a Big Mac is the Grand Mac that they had for a short time. Come on McDonald's bring back the grand Mac.<//Text>

Consistently, consistent. Every town and every store, provides the exact same food.
Can’t beat it for the money.</text>

<review>They cannot get the new double quater pounder right.  I've had it fresh when I visited Chicago this summer. Best burger I had in a long time. These McDonald's in Los Banos NEVER make the double quarter "made to order".  It's stale and tastes like they took it from under a heating lamp.

I even said directly...MADE TO ORDER.  Do you think that's what they are doing?  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  They have false advertisement.  If I had not done it right in another city, I would have never noticed.  They are better off not advertising that its "made to order" and people wouldn't have higher, or at least decent, expectations.

NO FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!<//review>< user_id>

< Review>
On the surface, this is a typical McD. However, the owner or management is playing games with the combos -- popular combos like the sausage Mc muffin are not offered here. Instead, they charge for each item separately  (sandwich, drink, hash brown are sold separately) resulting in a higher cost overall == more profit to the business.  Recommend you go to the other McD in this area since that location  doesn't overcharge like this location does.< /Review>

On the surface, this is a typical McD. However, the owner or management is playing games with the combos -- popular combos like the sausage Mc muffin are not offered here. Instead, they charge for each item separately  (sandwich, drink, hash brown are sold separately) resulting in a higher cost overall == more profit to the business.  Recommend you go to the other McD in this area since that location  doesn't overcharge like this location does.< /Text>

<review>I actually left due to the long wait at the drive-thru, the exterior doors were locked to customers and I didn't see a sign on the door explaining  hours that the doors are open to customers?
The line at the drive-thru wasn't necessarily long, it just wasn't moving? There was a Service Truck backed up to the kitchen door and the motor was running. However, all I saw was a driver passively sitting behind the wheel.
After idling for several minutes, the line never moving, I backed out and left. As I drove out of the parking lot the vehicles were at a stand-still.
I can e only been through this McDonalds once before, and they were quick.
They are always busy, probably due to their location, being at a crossroads that will take you to other destinations depending on which way you're traveling?<//review></record>

Food safety is a joke
My opinion this must be the worst McDonalds in the central valley

I told the manager twice and yhis sanitation violation still continues, it's disgusting.  I wrote to the McDonald's  site as requested and this still continues.
People please be aware of the possible danger. During evening/night shift. The kitchen  at times have one grill cook, this one grill cook places the frozen hamburgers on the grill,  then with those same gloves/ hands, after toughing raw meat, now touches your cooked hamburger and buns along with all of the condiments. The damger of food borne illness, because this same cook that handles the raw food,  is now contaminating the burger you will now eat, is extremely dangerous.
I will not eat here at all...this is a terrible unsafe cross contamination practice,  good luck< /Text>

After we had paid and had gotten our food they suddenly forgot our Carmel frap. We had arrived home and saw that our order was mistaken we had our order sooo wrong my parents were beyond pissed and I know I should’ve checked the order first but they shouldn’t yell at us or get our order wrong in the first place!< /text>< pics>

<review>Quick on the go meal via drive thru coming home from fishing at the Los Banos Dam. The line wasn't long. They took my order quickly and we got our food in about 2  minutes after paying.

Not much to notice except that the drive thru sign was well lit up, to my surprise.  Friendly smiles on both guys taking order & giving me my food. 5 stars - usual like any other McDonalds.<//review>< username>

Terrible service. Not properly staffed to handle a lunch rush. No ice in soda machine. and of course since they aren't properly staffed I had to take my change in quarters because all 3 of the managers wouldn't help there employee Justin get $1 bills. Terrible service by the managers they failed their staff today. And they want $15 an hour lol</Text>

At 5am I pulled up to the drive thru and no one was there to take my order. There were even people waiting outside to get in. This is third time this happened I waited ten minutes and left. I rather pay $3 more across the street at Jack in the Box.< /Review>

<Review>There are a lot of flies in the establishment. Not very professional, in my opinion. Not to mention all additional condiments are not free, and you can only eat in the restaurant for 30 minutes.  .< /Review>< date>

<Review>To add to my experience your management is not friendly or helpful to new employee at register. When I called McDonald's was so upset over continued bad service had to go in to ask management store number lady on McDonald's complaint line heard for herself how rude they are.< /Review><userid>112333629704476420327<//userid><date>1504412965497</date>< rating>

The staff here seemed overworked and angry. There weren't very many customers in line, and yet it took them a very long time to take orders, and even longer for the food to come out of the back. We spent 15 minutes total to order a small fries. Would not go back.<//text>

On June 4, 2016 in the morning, my aunt asked cashier and took an empty coffee cup, about minute later whom looked like a supervisor at the counter, asked me for $1.08 for the empty cup that my aunt took.  I paid for it since I don't want any hassle.  But my aunt was angry about the situation that she asked before taking the cup, and an empty coffee cup as the lady said it's very expensive, but it shouldn't be $1.08.  For god sake, cup with coffee is $1.08.< /review>

We are not in a good mood or simply have a bad day so if one day they open us up for a little, what we curse is better to leave and not give anything to the person who tended you and then have the advantage of bolver or SIMPLY STOP GOING?
