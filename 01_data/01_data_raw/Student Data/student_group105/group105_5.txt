The owner is warmly welcome and helpful to find what needed for my garden project. You can also request the estimate if you are looking for building a garden. I had more than 20 kinds of plants and tree for multiple quantities at very reasonable price. Check out photos what I got today. All are healthy and beautiful.</Text>

<text>I have gotten several plants and lots of ground cover for my backyard and have not been disappointed. Their dirt is wonderful, you will never buy soil from the store again after you try their's. Staff are so nice and helpful in your planting needs. Enjoy and thank you< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNAjNGNbCuyLgrX82M8Rhu2WzlgCrdfJw5WabD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

I hired Perez to re-do my front and backyard. Overall they were great - they did take some liberties with the design over what I had talked to them about, but in the end things looked great. I had 7 plants out of the 50+ that were dying, and was told they would replace them. After repeated calls, emails, and voicemails, I haven't heard back. So, they do great work, but there is no support there for any issues.< /text>

Original work good..THEN, 1.5 years later the front stonework cracking, lifting, and sinking.  Hand delivered letter when Luis, Jr. was present  and several trips to the nursery..speaking with Irma...NO RESPONSE/ NADA / NOTHING.  Nothing but lip service..apparent reputation  for lack of follow up. Think when you move into a new area you don’t know and they talk a good game..no follow up with problems. How do they stay in business?!< /text>

I live in Brentwood and have shopped many times at Perez Nursery.  Every time I go, the service is very good and Irma is very knowledgeable in helping all customers with making the right selection of plants.  This nursery has a great selection of  plants and trees in all sizes and prices are very good.  The nursery is well kept  making everything look so healthy. I can’t leave this place without buying something every time I go.
It is also very much Kid friendly! A great place to visit with the whole family.  Bring yourself an ice tea and take time to enjoy it.  Highly recommended.<//Review>

Nicest owner ever.  Very helpful and the fruit trees I got are very healthy and huge.  She dropped the price on all 3 and saved me about $60 on all 3.  Would recommend them all day long< /Review>

The reviews all over the internet tell the story about Perez Nursery, look no further.  Horrible service & worse products - that really sums up my experience without calling on specific people.  We purchased thousands of dollars worth of products and unfortunately ended in a bitter dispute.</Review>

I have extremely perfect experience with this business and Irma personally. We moved in the area 6 month ago and wanted to redo front and backyard. With Irma's suggestions we planted over 10 fruit trees and many shrubs. She came to site when I asked her, even I didn't promise to buy anything from their place. Of course, people who doesn't want to " bend a finger" and waiting for contractors to perform everything for them and call them back to fix smallest things, they wont probably like this place because they are busy.
She was and is our great resource and plants she ordered for us were under Home Depot/Lowes prices and better quality.
We are happy with this business and highly recommend it.<//review>

I'll try to keep this short, however In reality I won't be able to. Craton and Stan replaced my A/C condensing unit, evaporator coil and hot water heater. Their work was well thought out and methodical. They were constantly looking ahead and planning for the next step. Their end result was perfection. I am incredibly pleased with the attentiveness of their field staff and the constant communication from their office employees. It can be stressful allowing people in your home, however that was not the case for us. Stan was great with our dog and even played fetch for a few minutes while he pulled down our A/C system. I couldn't be happier with all aspects of their work. They even patched up some drywall that was missing behind my old A/C evaporator coil. Definitely a great company with quality technicians! Pierson mechanical has earned my business and every referral I can possibly make. Thank you!!!</review>

I have used this company on 2 jobs.  1 full replacement of a heating and AC system and another on duct work and thermostats.  They are well priced and I am very happy with their work.  From the owner, to their workers, to their admin, they are through, polite and always there to help and try and find the best cost effective solution for you.  Highly recommend using them.<//review>

We recently purchased a home in Mendocino County. After a few months, the heating went out. Our home warranty provider sent an company out (not Pierson) and they said that we needed to replace the whole system. The home warranty company then sent Pierson Mechanical out for a second opinion.

We did not need a new system. The forced air unit was fine. The original installer had jury-rigged a "zoned" system, and that faulty wiring had failed. Pierson ordered a new zoning board and installed and rewired it quickly. They were responsive, on time and honest! When it comes time to replace our system, they will be our go-to for a new system. I highly recommend them.</text>

The team at Pierson is fantastic! They communicated well, we punctual and gave us a heads up if delayed, and helped navigate our home warranty to replace a furnace unit in our house. Craton also taught me some details of our heating system that I was unaware of and the different ways we could use filters throughout the system. On the replacement day the supplier gave them the wrong system and they drove back to the supplier to ensure we had the proper one. They did thorough testing throughout the replacement to ensure everything was working well. Also communicating expertly throughout the process. I would use them again in a heartbeat. Thank you Craton and team!<//review>

<review>During a recent summer heat wave our A/C couldn’t cool down the house, even though it was able to all the years before. Not only did they discover we needed Freon, they also discovered a ducting problem we would have never known about. Showed up on time, thoroughly explained issues, fixed the problems and our 15 year old unit works better than ever. From the office staff to repairs, professional all the way.

<review>The technicians from Pierson Mechanical were personable, professional, and efficient.  The AC replacement concluded with absolutely no problems.  The technicians were knowledgeable and prepared for the removal of the old unit and installation of the new unit.  I highly recommend them to anyone who needs HVAC services.  To cap it off, they completed the work on time and under budget.  It was an overall great experience.  Thank you Pierson Mechanical!< /review>< pics>

After having our air conditioner "repaired" by another company, it still wasn't cooling off our home. So we made an appointment with Pierson Mechanical. The repairman was great. He found the problem, wired around the problem until he could get the part in that needed to be replaced. Our AC has been working  great ever since. And when he replaced the part our bill was considerably less than the first company who didn't fix the problem. Pierson Mechanical is 5 star in my book.< /Text>

The service from this company was exceptional. We called for a malfunctioning air conditioning unit in a very hot area during a heat spell. Craton, the owner, was able to squeeze us in at the end of his day and was actually able to repair the unit for a very cost-effective amount. He was extremely helpful about pointing out other issues and items for consideration with regard to the unit. He was very professional, prompt, and it was an excellent value for his highly skilled services. Can’t recommend him and his company highly enough.</Text>

The whole team at Pierson Mechanical was great to deal with. They did their best to repair my almost 40 year old unit just to get us back up again. When it was determined that it couldn’t be fixed they hurried to get my replacement unit installed. Pierson Mechanical has a great team of employees. I highly recommend them.< /Review>

We bought this home in October, and our realtor gave us a contract with  Fidelity National Home Warranty to cover any issues that might come up for a home built in 2005. Good thing, too! Our home has two separate AC units, and each pooped out within a couple months of each other. Pierson Mechanical came out each time to repair the units. Mr. Pierson showed up on time took care of the problem. One and done. No mistakes, no need for a second call on the work he completed. I was concerned that any company who has a contract with a home warranty company might not be top-notch. I was absolutely wrong. I highly recommend Pierson Mechanical and will continue to use them even after the home warranty expires.< /Review>

< review>
My friends AC needed maintenance 4 months ago. No cooling. They initially called Performance Mechanical who came out and told them they needed to replace the entire AC for $10k.
When they told me their story I called Pierson Mechanical and explained the problem. Their tech came out and cleared the clogged line and recharged the AC for less than $300. The AC
That's a BIG difference, $10k verses $300. I have no idea why Performance is still in business. They are overpriced and incomplete.</review>

I HIGHLY recommend you utilize Pierson Mechanical for any of your A/C needs. They were timely and professional. They came out on a weekend to service my unit while all the other companies could not fit me in. Most importantly, they are skilled at what they do and provide EXCELLENCE through their service. Bottom line: they get it done right!<//review>

Very pleased with the entire team at Pierson Mechanical, from the technicians who replaced our furnace to the front office. Our furnace is located in our attic which made if very difficult to remove the old furnace and replace it with the new furnace. But they did a great job in a minimum  of time. And we have heat again!< /text>

Rebecca - very responsive and informative about the options I had with installing an AC coil and replacing my furnace.  She also worked with my warranty company which helped the installation be completed in a timely manner.
Stan - highly knowledgeable and skilled in the installation of the AC evaporator coil and the furnace. Very professional and creative in making modifications to fit the new equipment.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>After losing our heater on New Years Eve, our warranty company wanted to hire a 1 Star company to come out and help us. After I refused them and asked for a more reputable company, Pierson Mechanical was asked and they definitely lived up to their expectations! They were quick to respond as well as promptly on time. They found the problem easily and new exactly how to fix it the next time they came out which was also a quick response time. I would do business with them again in a heartbeat!<//Review>< Pictures>

My mother's old boiler went out after the fires.  Pierson was obviously very busy but they took great care of her.   Creighton worked overtime and through a lot of hurdles to get her up and running.  I'm very grateful he didn't let my mom stay in a cold house any longer than needed.  And it's worked great ever since the fix, even though he had to upgrade pretty old technology!< /Review>

<Review>Pierson Mechanical is everything one would hope for when in need of service. They are professional, courteous, prompt, knowledgeable and very efficient. They also service some of the more difficult systems that other companies shy away from. Not once have we had to request a return visit after work was completed. They went above and beyond what our Home Warranty required of them and beyond what I would’ve ever expected! If ever I have a need for service in their field, I will definitely request them through our warranty. And if it is an issue outside of the warranty, they are undoubtedly who I would chose for retail work!<//Review><user_id>100152589837454803711< /user_id>< date>

<Text>It started as a cold winter morning, we soon found that our gas fired heater was not working. We called Pierson and they came to our house the next day.
Bright and early the next morning they arrived and started to work, within the hour they had found the problem and fixed it.
Now we had heat and our lies were back to what they should have been.
We recommend these very professional people .< /Text>< gmapID>

We had a home warranty and the first assigned company tried many repairs over weeks without success. They were fired and PIERSON came in and decisively convinced the warranty company that replacements were required. New Trane equipment was installed and has now operated perfectly for 8 months. It was done right the first time with good friendly communications. Well done.</Review>< Pics>

The repairman fixed my air conditioner and worked late to get it working after the other company Rose Heating has taken eight weeks with me with no AC and Rose Heating didn’t get it fixed.  I would recommend Pierson Mechanical as they got my AC working in in three days and did an excellent job!

We bought a house in June. Turned out the A/C didn't work. At all. Our Home Warranty company sent out one HVAC company who totally, completely strung us along for most of the summer; 90-100 degrees for weeks, no A/C. Then the Warranty Company (hopefully) fired HVAC company #1, and sent us Pierson Mechanical  from Lakeport. Crayton is the boss, he showed up, diagnosed the problems, ordered the parts, and he and his assistant Kevin removed/replaced my compressor and plenum. It was an all day job, and they did an outstanding job. As a retired general contractor I want to highly recommend Pierson Mechanical. If I could add a 6th * star I would.</Text>

<text>Over the New Years holiday I walked into my home and turned on the furnace, within minutes the house smelled of rats.  I reached out to Pierson after finding them i  a Google search. I originally was interested in having the ducts cleaned in the home.  I spoke with the lady on the phone that was very helpful. She tokd me that they typically like to cone and estimate projects before hand.   I dont live in the home where the issue is so I asked that on the day of the appt the tech arrives ready to perform the work since I would have to send my wife and 7 mo old son to meet them. She ask some great questions about the details of the home and the next morning I had a quote in my email from Craton. I approved the proposal knowing that it may change one the team arrived to perform the work.  The appt was scheduled for the following week and Craton arrived on tine as promised a assessed the situation.  What he found was several ducts has been damaged and over tun with rodents.  Basically all of the duct work under the home needed to be replaced.  He thoroughly explained everything to my wife and made her feel very comfortable and confident in his solution. I also have a hone service business and understand the value of trustworthy honest people.  Craton and his team will be coming out next week to install the new system.  We have had a home in lake county for 3 generations and have always struggled with finding reliable people.  Glad to have met all of the great people at Pierson and would highly recommend them to anyone.< /text>< pics>

Good workmanship, diagnosed and fixed my car vehicle issue immediately and had my vehicle running like new in a day! Best price in Fullerton area mechanic, called different auto body shops for quote on the same problem and they couldn’t compare to this auto mechanics pricing and quality work. (6 months later): Still No Issues with my vehicle overheating, Drives like new still.</Review>

Always reliable and honest service. Five of five star. So need to be waited a long hours due to plenty of customers. And I could not stop by when I have not enough time to get services. But I will be with them if I have a chance. Highly recommended...!< /text>

<Text>Triangle Tattoo & Museum in Fort Bragg California is one amazing place to experience!

Mr G. was kind enough to attend a Career Day Zoom presentation as guest speaker for one of our high school classes. He was scheduled for a half hour time slot but was asked to stay  for an hour!

His presentation covered the History of where, why, who, and how body painting got started. And how it progressed to modern day. He had a terrific slide show depicted the many cultures across the world use of it.

He covered how women became part of it and why. How the depression and wars played a part in it and so much more. Mr. G shared his personal experiences in tattooing.

He is an amazing tattoo artist that is highly knowledgeable, skilled, amiable, imagineable,
Creative, and respectful.

The Museum part is equally as amazing g as it has historic tools and images to enjoy and be intrigued by. It is a must see!

He is coming back for an encore!!!</Text>< rating>

Niki is talented, funny, and we had a GREAT time while she inked my shoulder. From design to reveal, Niki was professional. She asked lots of questions, listened to my answers, and created a tattoo for me that was exactly perfect. I was also privileged and honored to meet, and spend time talking with, Madame Chinchilla. She is an amazing and lovely lady. My ever patient husband posed with the sign out front.<//text>

Firstly, I’d like to mention that I’ve only ever given 2 reviews before this. I’m not often inspired or motivated to give a review, so this should already tell you something.

Madame Chinchilla and Mr. G are by far the greatest people you will ever encounter. They’re chock-full of stories from their wild days, which always make for great conversation throughout your piece, and are extremely welcoming and friendly. Madame Chinchilla was keen on accommodating me (a last minute arrival) despite busy schedules and a nearing closing time. Mr. G was able to take me on last minute without any fuss. A true gentleman. The piece itself was quite small (I was only in town for that night, so a quickie was necessary–plus, they were closing soon), and a Sailor Jerry tattoo, but Mr. G treated it as if it meant more to me (it does now). Spectacular work, great shading, professionalism. I’ll update with a photo at a later time when it’s all healed up. What was initially supposed to be a “just because” tattoo, became even more through the experience, detail and love put into it.

With regard to the museum, it is completely riddled with varying styles of tattoos, their histories, equipments used over the years and photos of Madame Chinchilla and Mr. G throughout their years together (super cute couple btw). There are also a number of books with interesting facts about tattoo culture and history as well as stories of interesting people and their equally interesting body art.

We’ll definitely be coming back! Madame Chinchilla says it so. Thank you both for the wonderfully memorable experience!<//review>

< Review>
Nevermind Glass Beach..
Hit up the Triangle Tattoo Museum first!
What an amazing collection of history!
Was fortunate enough to meet Madame Chinchilla herself back In  2015 when we passed through. She is such a gem!
Viewing the artwork on the walls alone could take an afternoon.
Definitely a ten out of ten!< /Review>

<Text>I have been to Fort Bragg several times but had never had the opportunity to visit the Triangle Tattoo & Museum until now. I decided to have a tattoo done in memory of someone I had recently lost and let me tell you, it came out beautifully. I had the pleasure of being tattooed by Nikki, who talked to me through the entire process. She made me feel welcome and relaxed and chatting with her the whole time took my mind off of the pain. She was truly lovely and what's more is that she gave me a beautiful tattoo that I love. I recommend coming here for a tattoo 10 out of 10.</Text><gmapID>0x80803548e7dc01ed:0x1e6bfbb945600c8f< /gmapID><Time>1555081266571<//Time><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

When I came in, I wandered around for a bit until I met (startled) Nikki, one of the artists. She was super helpful in pointing out where things were and told me to just look around and enjoy myself. I was able to go through any open door to check out the exhibits. It is mostly photos, but there is a lot of really cool tattoo/circus memorabilia as well.

I wasn't aware that it was also an active tattoo shop. I had an idea hobbling around my head and mentioned it to the other artist, Scott. He was very friendly and seemed genuinely excited to do the work. We found a font that was good, but he redrew it by hand to make it perfect. And it was. The tattoo itself only took him about 20 minutes to complete and his line work was perfect. It looks like he wrote it with a pen. I'm so incredibly happy I popped in on my way to the beach.<//Review>

I had a tattoo done this past weekend. It's absolutely beautiful. The artist listened and worked with me for quite some time. The result is a more perfect expression of my vision than I dreamed. My granddaughters went through the museum and were impressed. Mr. G wasn't obviously there but Madame Chinchilla is a treasure.<//review>

<Review>I had my first tattoo done here when I turned 18 (in 1993). I always said I would come back!! Its funky, interesting and although a little pricey,  I'm 100% comfortable with their sterilization techniques and that's super important to me. Niki was amazing and spent a great amount of time making sure I got what I wanted and would have no regrets. This was a tribute to my stepdad and had to be what I wanted. I can't wait to come back next year with my girls. Thank you Niki!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>I love how they have transformed this tiny tattoo shop into a sort of museum. It definitely is VERY small, so if you are claustrophobic or get dizzy easily, I don't recommend staying for too long. The amount of tattoo history they have covering their walls is fascinating. As we are walking through, we keep seeing photos of this "Madame Chinchilla and Mr. G" and think, "oh those must be some cool famous tattoo people." Suddenly a older woman comes out and starts asking us about the museum and tells us stories about tattooing and come to find out it is Madame Chinchilla herself! She is very sweet and so knowledgeable. I wish I had the time to get tattooed there! Next time I'm in Mendocino I'll have to schedule an appointment!</Text><resp>None</resp>< rating>

Funky little place with a lot of cool history. I definitely recommend checking it out if you are in the area. Staff will give you a tour and tell you about all the photos if you ask. Has displays on tattoo traditions from around the world and some antique tattoo machine rigs. Long narrow flight of stairs to get in, so it is not wheelchair accessible unfortunately.<//Text>

<review>Liz was the one to do my tat and she did a really good job. She was very upbeat and had me laughing through most of the work. I would recommend everyone at least come in to check out the museum. It has a lot of history about ink there. Madam Chinchilla was also there and had a lot of stories to tell.

Walked in today with a simple request to have a semi colon tattoo done in remembrance of my husband that committee suicide 3 years ago.  I knew I was in the right place when I walked in and meet madam Chinchilla and told her want I wanted and why and she said Mr. G would do my tattoo. It was my first tattoo and they made it such a special occasion.
I happen to have some of my husband's ashes in the necklace I was wearing and Mr. G asked if I would like some of  them added into the ink for my tattoo. I thought that would be a great tribute to my husband As he would have loved this place. He carefully open the necklace and added some into the ink. Mr. G and Madam Chinchilla were very attentive with me and my daughter the whole time and made this seem as special to them as it was to us.
Thank you for such a moment 💕<//review>

Madame Chinchilla and Mr G. Madame was such a fascinating individual. She sat with us for over 2 hours conversing. Great place to visit with the history and pictures of tattoos.</Text>

LOVE TRIANGLE TATTOO AND THE PEOPLE THERE.  MR. G DID MY FIRST TATTOO IN THE EARLY 90'S, AND I'VE BEEN BACK SEVERAL TIMES SINCE.  MADAME CHINCHILLA AND MR. G DID MY MINE AND MY WIFE'S WEDDING TATTOOS, AND MADE IT AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.  LOVE THE MUSEUM  LOTS OF TIME, LOVE AND CARE HAS BEEN PUT INTO IT.< /review>

Great little place to visit right on main st. Cool unique Shoppe. Madame chinchilla is a very sweet person, would love to come back to get some tattoo work done. Awesome place! Small Kids friendly not some much! Small tight rooms with collectables and glass cases floor to ceiling art. Perfect for teens and adults.<//Review>

Made an appointment and when I came in she was still tattooing on someone else. Their supposed to take a $50 deposit but she never does. I had waited for my appointment for a week. this was my special moment that I've been waiting for for 5 years! I didnt get any ink and I left in tears. I really dont appreciate this because this is the second time she did this to me. She is unprofessional, she even said it herself.</text>

A must see for Fort Bragg visitors!! There is so much history and information, you could spend several days here! Niki has excellent customer service and her artwork is second to none. My tattoo is more beautiful than i could have ever imagined!! Thank you so much for the experience and lifetime of beautiful art. You must visit  Triangle Tattoo and Museum!!</text>

"A very magical place to restore the imagination."
" A pot of gold at the end of a very windy rainbow."
"Fresh water when you've been baptised by fire."
"The emerald of the triangle."
"Where pictures speak through years of ink
And dead men's story's still get told."

Love Love Love you guys!</Review>

I wasn’t aware tattoo artist made $400 an hour then she refused to give me back the deposit even after I said well can I just get a sweatshirt that was $40 absolutely ridiculous never going back nor will I ever recommend anyone else go there< /Review><Response>{'time': 1537211296255, 'text': "Hello Amiee\nIt's common practice to charge a deposit to reserve your appointment. We are a very busy studio and when we take your deposit we are setting that time aside for you, and turning away Walk ins and other clients who would want that time. Therefore that deposit is non refundable. We make no attempt to hide that fact as we  tell you when you make the appointment as well as being printed next to the signature line on the receipt you had to sign. It's on your copy as well.\nOur prices reflect the work we put into each peice. The design you requested was highly detailed and spanned the side of the neck. We informed you that it was going to take longer than an hour. We also looked at other designs that could fit in the hour timeline.\nWe regret you didn't leave satisfied however we did our best to accommodate you while maintaining our integrity."}<//Response><rate>1</rate>< username>

<review>I have been on contract with Truly Nolan for the past 2 years and have had great results. Luis is my personal exterminator and he is very nice and professional. If I need him to do extra spider web removal or additional tasks, he always does it with a smile and pleasure.
My home is on 1/2 acre, 3 decks, gazebo, exterior entertainment areas, trees, shrubs, bushes, etc.. and have never had a rodent or pest issue get out of control or be a menace.
Every 3 months Luis comes out and spends about an hour taking care of business around my home. Also, if I notice any spiders, ants, or any other pests in between treatments, then I simply call the office and they send Luis out for additional treatments, at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.
It is a great service and one that all homeowners with children and pets should have to control / eliminate bugs, pests and all unwanted critters.
GREAT COMPANY AND SERVICE!!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDbZCO442cpoVuoDRrWh6hx5tsWtS-BKPpXh3U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1546273786987, 'text': 'Thank you Lou Sigur, for sharing your experience.

I recently had my annual termite inspection with Truly Nolen. I want to give a shout out to Dena Marschke for her work ethic and professionalism. She is timely, conscious, thorough, and always answers all my questions, even texting me after her work hours. She is an asset to Truly Nolen, and I hope they recognize her superior qualities as an employee.<//Review>

The first inspection was okay, they sold us on a year plan that they said was all they had. The first actual service didn't work, it made it worse. They missed a ton of spots, they never came for the second service or reached out, but they sure did charge my card for the monthly fee. I have called about 4 times, 2 of which is to cancel but I have yet to hear anything back from any manager they are claiming will call me back. The pest person tried to come to my house later than 6pm one night after not having any appointment or reaching out until 5 minutes before he showed up. I have yet to speak to any manager and I've been signed up for almost 2 months. Horrible service. They take your money and never get a hold of you when you have issues or trying to resolve those issues. Please work on your communication with people, if it wasn't this bad I would be repeatedly trying to cancel, which probably won't happen since NO ONE will call me back. So I'm paying for a service I don't want and that didn't help. I also received a random bill for 17 dollars. Which no can can explain to me what it is for.< /Text>

Dena
Did a complete and thorough inspection of the inside and outside of the house today. She was very professional  and friendly. She explained everything. (even the different termites) and pointed out problem sites of wasp/hornet nest. I was very confident and pleased with her work and wanted to give her an excellent rating! Thank you for a job well done.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>This was our first follow up from our treatment last year. Dena was very professional from the beginning, ie. morning call to give us status of her ETA. Our house number was not labeled very well so it took some time for her to find us, but the minor set back did not dampen her mood. She was friendly and courteous ie. adhering to social distancing and wearing a mask (THANK YOU!) and her overall energy was a breath of fresh air. After she inspected our property she not only gave us the results but also pointed out areas that we should keep an eye on and how to keep our home safe from pests. We were on the fence about renewing our yearly coverage (again it was our first time) but after Dena's amazing service we've decided to renew because we really feel like we're in good hands. Thank you Dena for all your hard work, we look forward to working with you in the future!</Text>< Pics>

Dena came in the hottest heat of summer and worked her tail off to get to the little termites monsters.  She found a  spot or two that the previous guys missed...or the termites found a new apartment in a new corner of my home.  Many thanks to her!< /review>

The following day he was back again to do our first treatment of the whole house, again he was professional in his ability to answer all our questions and concerns as we have dogs and we wanted to know if the chemicals were harmful to them, which were pet friendly. Ant traps were placed around the house and the parameter of the house on the outside was sprayed. Anthony was very knowledgeable on all the products he was using, he was clean and tided up after he was finished. Totally happy 100% with this service call.</review>< Pics>

Our Truly Nolen tech, Ricardo, arrived on time and performed what we felt was a thorough termite inspection in our attic, thought out the house and also outside. He was courteous, friendly and to best of our knowledge, very competent. Over the years that we have had termite coverage from Truly Nolen we have been, as far as we know, termite free.

Value appears  to be good. We have had no sign of termite activity since coming on with Truly Nolen..< /text>

<Text>They were courteous and on time. Problem is if you live in an apartment, don't even bother calling them. I saw a mouse in my kitchen and we wanted them to seal the entry points in the kitchen just a one time service but they said they can't do anything if you live in a condo because they need to seal the entire building not individual units. So our meeting lasted 5mins. Wish they said that on the phone no need to meet up for that.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1592840465505, 'text': "Patricia,\n\nThank you so much for your review of your experience with our company!

I had three companies provide a free quote for termite service. I chose Truly Nolen because they were the most thorough in their initial inspection. They provided great service overall and their pricing is very competitive. I highly recommend them.< /review>

We use Truly Nolen for our business pest control.  Every month, our service rep, Jerry Deel shows up with a smile on his face! He's very friendly and informative. He takes his time to make sure we don't have any issues and offers suggestions and is very personable. Everyone around the office loves Jerry.  He's great to work with and should be the face of Truly Nolen.  Truly Nolen, if you're reading, maybe use him in your ads or something but whatever you do, don't take him away from us. :)<//Review>

<user_name>Emily Biehl</user_name><Date>1566342196543<//Date><rating>1<//rating><text>If I could give less than one star, I would. The company I work for has been desperately trying to communicate with ANYONE at this company who can help us with an issue with our property agreement for service. Truly Nolen offered to combine two of our treatment agreements into one to save us money, but then continued to invoice us for both agreements separately with the incorrect amounts. Repeated calls and emails to Truly Nolen were ignored or brushed off. We have emails dating back to April of us trying to resolve this issue and yet no one seems to be able to help us. We get new invoices, we call 3x and email 3x, and either receive no response or a "call our office and someone can assist you" response via email. Naturally, any call we make to the number they provide is just to a voicemail that gets no answer. Come today: we get a notice of collection against us despite REPEAT attempts to contact them over the last 5 months. Horrible customer service, would not recommend based on this alone.

EDIT 8/20/19 - The plot thickens. The collections letter we received wasn't even for the correct amount. To top it off, when we received the letter to absolve the collection after finally being put into contact with an account rep, the name on the letter doesn't even belong to us...< /text>< Pics>

<Review>From the initial treatments through the seasonal inspections, the team at Truly Nolen are outstanding! They meet their appointment commitments, clearly explain the activity within the appointment, provide excellent service and follow through!
Besides the structural and re-sale value of Truly Nolen services, they help me deal with my extreme fear of spiders!!!!! Better them than me!</Review></record>

Recently we had our home inspected (we have this done annually by T.Nolan) by the BEST Technician on the planet-- Dena M-- & were surprised by her professionalism & integrity. She thoroughly examined the interior & exterior of our home, discussed her concerns, emailed her recommendations, then scheduled a return visit to spot spray vulnerable areas & then she followed through 100%. AMAZING Customer Service--- and at NO additional charge (at ALL) other than the small annual fee that we'd already paid!!!  Truly Nolan now has a customer for LIFE, thanks to this experience!</text>

<text>Started using Truly Nolen a few years ago and unfortunately I won’t be continuing with their services after our contract is up. I don’t really feel as though their services are worth the expense or hassle.

Every few months a technician is supposed to come by to treat the outside of our house. It’s convenient because they can treat the outside without us being home. We just need to remember to take the locks off our gates so they can access the backyard.

Most of the time a technician will randomly show up without any notice and I’m not home to let them in. I don’t get a phone call or notice warning me that someone is coming. I usually find out through the technician calling me saying “I’m at your house right now” and I’m already at work.

In other instances I’ve called to have someone come and treat the inside of my home and end up disappointed with the appointment. The past two times I’ve called to request this, the job wasn’t completed correctly. The first time, a technician showed up and treated the outside of my home and left before I realized they never came in to treat the inside. The second time around the technician sprayed one room and left.

Communication between the office and technician seems to be really poor. The technicians don’t really know what they were sent to do and they’ll just leave instead of checking in when they’re done.<//text>< pics>

I called Truly Nolen for a second opinion as whoever is contracted with my complex didn't find anything in my home. The original inspector that came was in my home for roughly 5 minutes. I continued to get signs of insects in my house so I called Truly Nolen. They sent out Scott Davidson to do an inspection and he was here for more than 30 minutes and did a full inspection. He found the root of my problem. (Thank God!) He was very professional and went over the options they had. Prices are VERY reasonable. So we set the date and they sent out Chris Barber to do the treatment. Again, very professional and informative. A big THANK YOU to Scott and Chris for being so kind and compassionate! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE guys! 🙂 I will recommend Truly Nolen to anyone needing pest control! 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Scott estimated arrival was between 3pm and 4pm. He arrived right at 3pm.

Chris estimated arrival waa was between 1pm and 3pm. He arrived right at 1pm.

Needless to say, they are extremely prompt and punctual!< /text>

Like the personal attention of the technicians--definitely 5 stars. Not too happy that I never know what property the technician is serving as the reminder sent to me never had the property address - I always have to call to find out. Only downside of Truly Nolen and the reason they get a 4-star. However, if one has only one property, this will not be a problem and you will like the service.</text>

Scott Davidson and Chris Mosby are true professionals that their company should value at the highest levels. They were efficient, thorough, and I insist that they do all my future service for Truly Nolen. If everyone at Truly Nolen were as good as these two guys, there would be no competition. Well done fellas. Well done.</Review>

It took a week of my calling an ant problem in my backyard to make a trouble call appointment. He certainly did not come at the established appointment time but claims without the usual proof of service that he came and didn’t see any ants. I have no idea if he did anything.

When we purchased our home a number of years ago and the sellers used Truly Nolen for their termite inspection. At that time we had such great experience we decided to use them again when we sold the property.  So I called and spoke to some of nicest CSR and made the process so easy so.

On the day of our scheduled inspection our Tech Scott arrived promptly and ready for our inspection. Scott was professional and very informative in the whole process. He went over various options with me and pros and cons of each. I was so impressed with his friendliness and education level. He did a through inspection and took the time to talk to me about it.   Then spent the time going over payment options also.

I would highly recommend Truly Nolen and Scott especially to do business with. I will be recommending them all our friends and realtors we know.

Great job Truly Nolen!

My profile states Saturday’s only as I have dogs needing containment during the service call.  This request is rarely considered and I most always need to reschedule. On top of that, for this last call I was not notified via postcard with a follow-up phone call. This month, the serviceman showed up on Wednesday, 8/28. I am glad I was home; however, I am so frustrated with your service schedules.<//text><rating>1</rating>< gmapID>

They always address your unique issues and that tends to vary from season to season.  Highly recommended.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I manage an apartment complex where one of the Truley Nolan technicians was spraying for a tenant of ours. Our lease states that tenants cannot contract with outside vendors. The Truley Nolan technician told me to go to hell when I questioned him about when the last time he sprayed the unit. i would not recommend this company for their unprofessional attitude. Plus, the technician was spraying for BEDBUGS which is mandated by California law to be disclosed to the property owner.< /text>< Pics>

<review>I contacted Truly Nolan due to a co-workers mention of their company.  At that time I had a quarterly contract with another pest control company.  I was not satisfied with the other company's service and their lack of customer service. Coincidentally, during that same time period, we suddenly we found ourselves with a mice problem. I searched the company online and reached out to schedule an appointment.  I reached the call center, after explaining the situation they assured me a technician would reach out to me shortly.  I received a call almost immediately.  The call came from Mr. Ricardo Contreras, Mr. Contreras was very professional, courteous and knowledgeable.  After explaining my situation he scheduled me for an inspection within a few days.  Two technicians showed up the day of the appointment.  They completed the inspection and contacted me immediately with an assessment and quote.  The quote was reasonable and I proceeded with the service the very same day.  They secured all possible entrance avenues for the mice.  I have not had any mice issues since then. I am extremely satisfied with the service.  Mr. Contreras has gone above and beyond in servicing my account.  Truly Nolan has exceeded my expectations so much so that I just recently contacted them to complete an additional service, a Termite Inspection.    Mr. Contreras completed the inspection and walked me through the property pointing out the problem areas.  I highly recommend Truly Nolan, they have knowledgeable caring staff and provide great customer service.  They are very accommodating in their scheduling which I appreciate very much.  For anyone looking for a caring, knowledgeable pest control company I  would have to say Truly Nolan is the right company.<//review>< pics>

< review>
Hired Truly Nolan with a 1-year contract to rid our home of Rodents (who had caused serious water damage) back in November of 2016 ..... and 8 month later we are still have problems with rats in our home.

The Truly Nolan 1-year contact was over $600 .... for that that they will do their best to find likely entry points and block them up, put out snap traps and glue traps .... and that is it.

I could done that all my self for $50 ..... they have company policy that they can't put bait boxes outside your home.

So for company that drives around in a vehicles that look like a rodent, they can't seem to solve our problem.

Very disappointed with the level of service and results.< /review>

<text>I must say, Truly Nolen strives to give excellent service, although they don't always quite get there. Several times service has been scheduled and either no one has showed or the time window was incorrect even though the main office put me on hold to confirm the day/time with the San Diego office and I was SURE about the time/day. They tell me they want to do an emergency service when a trap has a mouse or rat but when the technician comes out to get the dead animal, they either don't have peanut butter or don't have fresh traps to replace one if we had to throw it away due to waiting too long for someone to come. I do want to recognize on employee for his exceptional service, Manny, who willingly goes beyond the standard service if we ask. For example, it wasn't time for our seasonal service but I was noticing spiders in the house so he treated again. He knows where he set the traps, checks them all, always has peanut butter for them and extra traps if needed and even added wire to the edges of our garage door to keep the rats and mice from cruising in. When other technicians are scheduled for a follow-up service, I have to be home to show them where all the traps are or some are missed as my partner doesn't remember them all. A compliment to the office staff: they are always friendly, polite and trying hard to provide good service.
Update on 6-23-19: I also want to acknowledge German, who has been providing regular and excellent service more recently.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1561416394161, 'text': "MaryBeth,\nThank you so much for rating Truly Nolen so highly!

When I started with Truly Nolan back in 2015, I had issues with flying ants and crickets and they took care of the problem.  The service people that come out every quarter (George is my technician) is very friendly and will let you know if there are any other problems that have come up since the previous quarterly inspection.  Great Company!</Text>

It had a nice environment and the food tasted good, it was just a little pricey. I spent $15 for ramen and it tastes good but the price was just higher than other places. Portion size was great, it didn't fill me up but it didn't starve me.< /Review>

<Text>We had the shyshy roll, bond roll, lion king roll, tuna tataki, bbq skewer beef and chicken, and the red tonkatsu ramen ( wish we took pics but I honestly didn't think it would be this good). The skewers was very flavorful, the tuna tataki was seared perfect. The rolls was well prepared with the right amount of rice. I love sushi and I can honestly say that this place is one of the best tasting sushi restaurant I've been to, and I've been to a lot< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809ac764db40f2db:0xf409c4683c8d1559<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>By far one of the best Japanese restaurants around! Chef Daniel and the rest of the staffs' attention to detail in every bit of food that leaves the kitchen is shown with the beautiful presentation and tasted in every bite. The nigiri are single bites of complex and amazing flavors that never disappoint! Daniel brings in special types of fish that are not normally found in your every day sushi restaurant. For example, Norwegian Trout! The way Chef Daniel prepared the trout hit me with memories of cleaning trout with my grandfather next to the campfire. The flavors married so perfectly that it will forever be engrained in my memories.
At this point I have had all of the regularly offered ramen selections and have absolutely loved every one. There is also great udon options as well.
A great selections of classic and special rolls are always available. With donburi and other regular Japanese dishes, there is something for everyones taste.
You'd be crazy not to eat here, just go, you won't be disappointed!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnTFa9F35ThnI1v_EGXkd1H5hPjBvvZGF-m6AX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwjOxYKlEofMWif3El5oovt9ZbRK-7qvvgv3YI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrYdL7XOx2tQ1qVs7dSdFFkBZATKKyces9VWIA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGIRJ4TsKyh_HkC0X-ru6N5tFGuXyJIK44HLzh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvtAZusU1TFyeOPXQgM34K1TfWR1xK_lL1UI1Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObfiFaApe6gIXTKKOgm40W3K7guW7qtdcPjVmd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIDxfzkAuBGyU7QoDeLlGfjYXnpNm0jvjvrgm2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkrkoLv2vYiVWnrzU8XgiF_H7xtqw3Z-NhmAMC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

I cannot believe， grilled squid is $12.95, but it is not the whole squid, only part of the squid.  Even in the South Bay of San Francisco, I never had the grilled squid with this price and this portion of the squid.  And grilled chicken is not fresh, it is smelly.<//text>

<Text>Checked out another new place during the quarantine and again it comes to my endless need for Ramen. One tip I wanted to mention is we made our order directly with the restaurant as opposed to using any ordering site as they do not have a complete menu of items. I ordered the black garlic tonkatsu ramen which has been a bit or miss for me on some menus but this one did not disappoint.  The broth quality was much better and I really appreciated they did not over pack the noodles. We also ordered the Tempura, Gyoza and Pork Belly buns along with some other ramen dishes and were not disappointed. Definitely worth a visit. I'm a big fan of ramen places but some of my favorite don't have the best take out process or options but this place is quickly turning into one of my favorite take out the ramen places.</Text>< rate>

The lady server in here is very accomodating and friendly. She always make sure that her customers are satisfied and happy. She will even give you some recommendations if you are new to the place. The other staff are very friendly as well. They have a lot of variety of sushi and ramen .  Hokkaido ramen is a must try! The broth of that soup is tasty and a little bit of creamy. Wa sushi is a little bit of spicy but the tastiness of the fish is superb! Overall quality of the food, the staff and the cleanliness of the place is really worth a 5 star rating.<//text>

The quality of the food was outstanding and the portions were just the right amount. Me being a huge lover of sushi, I could tell the ingredients were fresh. The size of each sushi piece wasn't too big where I had to eat the piece with two bites, yet no too small to ask for another plate of sushi. However, the dishes seem to be a bit overpriced but the quality of the food and service make up for it tremendously. If you are in the mood for some   delicious Japanese food and willing to pay a bit more, I would highly recommend this restaraunt!!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Really enjoying the ramen here. Great broth. Excellent tare and aromatic oils. Very good noodles (slightly chewy, the way I prefer them). Perfect eggs (what the French would call moule). Perfectly cured eggs, I would add. They will give you hot chile oil and/or hichime on request. Will be going back to this place again and again. And will update my review as appropriate. Nice small place.  Service is friendly.  Food is simple but very filling and tasty.  If you are a vegetarian, they can substitute tofu to your dish at no extra cost.  Great place for small groups.</text>

I thought it was decent. Both my wife and I had extremely dry Chicken in our ramen, and the mushrooms were so rubbery they were almost inedible. On the upside, the broth was fantastic.<//review>

Been here two times already, and the place has great service, always had my glass of water filled, even when I didnt request it.

The menu itself provides more options other than Ramen, giving variety to a visit. Gonna be visiting more after that awesome crunch roll though!< /text>

<review>Service was good, I had the spicy ramen lunch and it was ok. It had corn, ajitame, and onions, not that many toppings. Soup was hot but bland. I had to add soy sauce to kick up the broth which I rarely do at other ramen houses. My 2nd time trying their ramen. I'll go again in 6 months and see.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
So I had the red tonkatsu and there chicken skewer (sorry cant remember the name). It was the best food I have had in a while. Decorum was really nicely done. Felt very fitting. Nice classical music played in the background. I would say that I would like more classical Japanese music. But that's just me.

Service was very friendly and polite. In all my time at wa ramen and sushi was well worth it. And to the staff thank you for the food and friendly service.</Review>

A all the way to the bay and the ramen here is absolutely amazing .I ordered the New York steak ramen and I was eating very slow because I didn't want it to end.

<Text>This place has the best nigiri in town.  Other sushi places the nigiri is often an after thought, and generally nothing special about it.

But this place is the place to go for excellent tasting nigiri.  They have a special 10 piece nigiri with soup and salad that is an excellent deal.

So if you are looking for an intimate setting, and not just crass commercialism of Mikuni, and a place where they care about fresh fish; then go here.< /Text><userid>101912077896752816585<//userid>< Response>

<Text>I loved the atmosphere here! My boyfriend and I did a wine tasting and were able to try several different ones for free. Alexa helped us and was great! She was fun, personable, and gave us good suggestions on what to try. We ended up buying three bottles of peach wine. I will surely recommend them to all of my friends!<//Text>< Rating>

Their place was very neat and classy. The food on their menu was very palatable and savory. We had steak last time we are here, and it was amazing and the best we ever had!

What else could I possibly think about this wine shop? When they had everything I needed. The bottles of wine I purchased from here were absolutely wonderful. This wine shop is ideal for unwinding, relaxing, and grabbing a bottle of wine. I can't wait to return to this store.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>This wine shop is outstanding! They have luxury decorations, great dishes, and the best selection of wines. They are always my favorite and my go-to wine shop every time I needed it. The staff is amazing and always interesting to interact with. The prices are not cheap, but once you taste you understand why. Thank you!</Review><pics>None<//pics><Name>Ifrah East<//Name><user_id>116780009735890726855</user_id>< Time>

This wine shop definitely has the best wines in the area! They are offering a vast choice of wines from cheap to expensive selections. I really had a great time in this place, and I would be happy to come back here again someday. A truly nice place to chill with your friends or family! Thank you so much!< /review>

<Review>This wine shop is very nice because the service was very accurate. If you run out of wine you can buy a bottle of wine in this shop or grab some drinks and chill. Thank you very much for the very valuable and excellent service you have. You're strongly recommended!</Review>< Gmap_id>

If you're looking to buy wine I can't recommend this place enough. I'm generally not a wine person but have been getting more into it lately, a friend recommended I stop by here and I'm really happy I listened!

The staff was friendly and happy to answer any questions. Even though I basically asked for something red and cheap, I got the impression the employee I spoke with treats every customer with the same courtesy whether it's a cheapo like me or someone with more know-how looking for a particular expensive vintage.

I went back a second time and had another pleasant experience so I'll be back again for sure. The prices are fantastic and the recommendations are on point. The world needs more stores like this.<//review>

<Review>It is regarded as one of the best wine retailers in the world. If you don't have time to visit the winery, you can instead peruse the wine store. Please do not hesitate to contact us as well! It even has a glowing recommendation!< /Review><Response>{'time': 1616888141156, 'text': 'Thank you for the review, Ila! Cheers!'}<//Response>< pictures>

It's our annual practice to have our wedding anniversary date here. Since the place was very romantic, and they're offering a range of wines. They may not be the cheapest, but they are very fair, though. They gave us two complimentary glasses of wine every time we were here. This is our favorite spot in the area!</text>

At the end of the day, we came to realize that we will come back. Also, as satisfied customers, we will rate you a 5-stars. Highly Recommended!<//review>

What a wonderful place! I bought a bottle of wine here last year and it was affordable. Also, I was elated and surprised that the staff were very entertaining and nice. Also, I loved the taste of the wine. It was better and OK. The place was even perfect to visit, and I loved to visit there when I have free time. Thanks for making me happy even if it was just a short time. Till next time!</Review>

I have been purchasing their wine since they started their business. They got great prices than any other wine store in the city. They also had the best service. Their staff was very knowledgeable about wine and beer, too. I hope they will stay longer for they have the best tasting and hard to find wines in the city.<//Review>

Terrific service, as well as the best prices in town!  John Lindsay and staff are extraordinarily knowledgeable and helpful to find the most interesting wine at the best price.  Selections from all over the world. Excellent tastings on Saturdays hosted by Jose - the friendliest wine server in town.  You'll love this place on Miramar Rd just behind the Dennys restaurant!<//text>

Nice people and an excellent selection of wines at what a little research has shown me are very fair prices.  The $10 to $15 Saturday tastings are wonderful - attend a few and you'll learn a lot.  You're welcome to bring your own food - bread, crackers, cheese - whatever you like.  I drive all the way from La Mesa to meet friends at this place, because everybody loves it.   Local treasure!< /Text>

The pjs are truly cool and comfortable. Remembering to pull them from the washer before they accidentally go through the dryer with a fabric softener requires I keep my wits about me. If pulling them out and hanging them on a hanger will keep them functioning properly, it is not too big a sacrifice. They are a little pricey, but I love them. Thank you.< /text>

I like Everything about the WOMEN'S MOISTURE WICKING LONG TANK GOWN . I like the feel of the material along with its moisture wicking properties. I like the style—the long tank style keeps me covered. I like the color (navy). It is comfortable and fits well. It’s a great product, and I will definitely buy a second one soon.</text>

This nightshirt has changed my sleep. Because it wicks and drys so quickly, my nights are SO much more comfortable. I used to wear cotton night shirts and most nights I would have to get up and change nightshirts half way through the night. I don’t have to do that anymore because if I am sweating, because it wicks, I don’t feel gross and it doesn’t interrupt my sleep nearly as much. This shirt, coupled with SHEEX sheets have changed my nights for the better!<//Text>

I now have two sets of these pajamas. They are so comfortable and they both keep me warm in the frigid Michigan winter, and cool when I have a warm flash in the middle of the night. They never feel clammy if I get sweaty. I have never been so happy with a pair of pajamas as I am with these.<//review>

Did I think the right material for sleepwear was this important? Well not waking up multiple times through the night sweating is a game-changer. Getting another set (so I can alternate and not HAVE to do laundry multiple times in the week. HA!)< /review>

<Review>I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he really likes them. Bought him both the long sleeve shirt and the pants and he likes how soft the material is. Says he hasn't been sweating nearly as much and they are super comfortable to sleep in. They are a touch long on him at 6 ft tall, but perfect for lounging around the house and sleeping.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1609860603352, 'text': 'So happy to hear that your gift to your husband was something he he liked!

This was a gift for my daughter in the navy leaf pattern. The size small fit her perfectly and she loves how it keeps her cool. She says quality great. I haven’t seen it so can only go by what she says. She would like more, but this Mom needs a lower price to buy her more.< /Review>

This is indeed a nice light material! It is more "cottony" than "silky", for those who are curious. There is definitely stretch to it, and this particular robe is roomy and has full-length sleeves. The inner ties, though thin, do work to keep it closed.< /Text>

This is my second one of these. This lounging nightgown is very comfortable and the perfect length. Easy care too. But most of all, it keeps me cool! I will definitely be buying this with sleeves for the cooler months, but for the warmer months I am liking the tank top style. Thank you Cool- jams!</Review>

I now own three Cool-Jams: sleeveless, short sleeve and long sleeve. I’m going to buy one more and throw out all my other nightgowns. The long sleeve style keeps you cool at night but still feels cozy in the morning while you’re having breakfast.</review>

I believe that my first Cool-Jams purchase was at least 20 years ago and prompted by massive hot flashes due to pre-menopause. That nightgown is still in my jammy drawer along with a couple others. The material has changed but not the function. LOVE these things!! ❤</review>

<Text>So soft, comfy, and nice! We were looking for a cooling bamboo duvet cover without the shiny surface that so many seem to have and this is perfect! My only complaint is that it doesn’t have ties In the corners to hold the duvet in place. But it’s so soft and gorgeous with our bedding, it was worth the minor inconvenience of having to buy duvet clips on amazon. We have washed it a few times and it’s just as perfect as when it arrived!<//Text>< Pics>

This was an excellent purchase. I do think I’m sleeping better when I wear it. Had expected it to have an actual cooler feeling on my skin, like a sun shirt I have. But, that’s not a negative, just different than what I was expecting. It looks enough like a dress that I can wear it on my deck near neighbors. I plan on purchasing other items soon. Thanks!<//Text>

After losing 50 lbs., my husband needed new pajamas. He insisted on Cool Jams for their soft comfortable feel. He wears a size medium for his 32” waist, 157 lb, 5’9” frame. We both wear Cool Jams—light, wicking, as soft as your favorite t-shirt. I have several pieces!<//Review>

I bought S/M blue masks primarily for my teenaged daughter, and M/L black masks for me. Well, I did not consider how the dark masks would quickly heat up in the brutal North Carolina sun. In contrast, when I tried my daughter's mask, it felt so much better. I'm seriously thinking of buying more blue ones. The color is beautiful, the fabric soft, and the size was good even for a 5'5" adult. Thanks for offering this product at a reasonable price.</Text>

These products are excellent for me. No longer are my pillowcases damp with moisture. My gowns are perfect. The material really does wick away moisture Thank you Cool-jams FC<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Amazing thrift store style place! They check your temperate at the door and limit the amount of people in the store at a time. After you try something on, they ask you to hand it to staff so that they can disinfect it. The store has a great selection of clothes my friends got matching 80s style won’t breakers. And another one of my friends got a beautiful leather jacket for only $35!!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I LOVE THIS STORE. friends and i visited countless times over the summer and the employees were the kindest and coolest people to talk to.

s tier selection for vintage suits and formal wear for meng.
great knitwear, skirts, corsets, crop tops, and silk bandana selection as well. if you're looking for unique finds at fair prices this is definitely the place to go. i was talking to an employee and they also said they get thrifted items really frequently too so the selection is always revolving.

After over an hour of poking around the store, I discovered an amazing grey leather jacket that cost me $125 after the clerk knocked $25 off because the shoulders were distorted from being on a hanger for so long. I figured the jacket might stretch back to normal with a bit of wear, and I was right. I have never seen anything like this jacket. It is the coolest item of clothing I have ever owned. No design label—just a European jacket size. People literally stop me on the street to ask where I got it. People have offered to buy it off my back. I can't promise you the same luck, but who knows? It's definitely worth visiting this store and really digging through the offerings. Have fun!</Text>

<Review>Amazing collection of vintage clothing.  The men's section is as big, if not bigger, than the women's which is great to see.  Be sure to check the meat locker.  Many items are European and unique.  This is the only store I can still find the old European pajamas.< /Review>< pics>

Cool shop for retro vintage apparel & accessories. They carry a wide selection of rare finds spanning from the 20's decade through the 90's. Service is at times unfriendly.</text>

Excellent selection of genuine vintage fashion that is categorized by decade...accurately (which is rare). Having owned my own vintage boutique for a decade, I can assure you the prices are excellent...and very fair for today's market. I will return!< /Text>

<review>Attention: Whitney,

I just wanted to tell you that day I came in and bought all that stuff from you, then called you back a couple of times? Oh yes, then your staff accused me of being romantically attracted to you?

Whitney, I need to be blunt with you. I never, ever had any kind of feelings for you other than gratitude which you and your staff misinterpret and I have no doubt you aren't mature enough to admit you were wrong since its easier to smear me, all when I was excited about going up and down thew west coast buying vintage clothing in little towns and stores then bringing them to stores in SF for resale.

THAT is why I wanted to talk to you Whitney.
Just FYI for you and your staff

Thanks for your outstanding customer service....?</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

F this state, f this Governor and f this Department. Been calling everyday for almost 2 months! Haven’t got through once. Haven’t received anything in the mail about my claim or even file number. Couldn’t register online because my previous Job was with the Federal Gov. only options were to call or fax. After zero luck on the phone I faxed my application a month ago and at Still haven’t heard anything. So fed up with the way this state is ran.< /text>

I sent over 30 emails for 4 months and got about 4 responses about telling me that they fixed it and its fine but absolutely nothing happens.  Then I called the offices over 2 weeks and got 4 calls through 3 out of the 4 just hanged up after 2+ hour calls. The 4th actually fixed it for 2 weeks then it stopped again 😑. Would give the service negative 5 stars</Review>

Very poor communication effort by edd and its government staff. During these terrible times many of us are in need of assistance.  They make it extremely difficult to get in contact with them and they never respond.  I've spent endless hours on the phone just to get Disconnected or hung up on. On UI online I've sent multiple messages with no responses.  These people need to be fired and replaced.  There is tons of people out there that need a job and will do the job better. Its been 3 months for me now.<//Review>

These reps dont know what they are doing I put like a month ago that I was attending school and just off that they stopped paying my benefits and then when I talk to a rep they say let me talk to my supervisor when I'm on hold they simply hang up they need to clean house on upper management and hire all new people. Its that simple. Hire people that want to help people out by taking there phone call even tho your on hold for more than 2 hours smh</Review>

EDD associates will lie to you. In fact I had one named Larry state he was fixing my account and would have my funds available in 48 to 72 hrs. He even put me on hold when he was supposedly fixing it. EDD needs to be audited and phone calls as well as any correspondence must be monitored. Do they have the intelligence to fix the issues with the caller instead of giving them the run-around? It would not be backlogged if they fixed issues rather than play games with ID verification etc.. it's time we get together and see about filing a class action law suit and or go to the Govonors office and be heard. EDD is commiting far more fraud than any of these ID theft criminals did. Let's stop complaining and take action.</review>

<Text>Oh hi. Been on hold for 3 hours. Didn’t know if it was possible or not. Guess it is! That’s not including my first time calling, a rep picked up after 30 mins, put me back on hold to hang up on me. Nice Edd. Nice!!! Idk the people you’re hiring, but please have better training. I had another rep pick up at the 1 hr and 30 min mark, I told him what help I needed, and he put me on hold again. Now it’s 3 hours. Do your reps really know what they’re doing because clearly they wouldn’t put someone on hold for this long if they did!!! It’s a damn shame!</Text><Time>1599267841605< /Time>< Gmap_id>

Disappointing and Discouraging.   We carried the economy for years, who to carry us now? My unemployment card was stolen and now after receiving my new card from Bank of America, edd froze my new card. also the bank denied my claim for stolen money from Bank of America ATM. Where to go now ? Can’t call edd!! Bank of America Is infested with corruption!! Where to oo next ?< /review>

It took me 11 weeks to get my debit card while certifying the whole time.

Now my account is suspended and I cannot get ahold of you.

If I could give you minus 2 stars I would.

Every time I call i get a different answer for the same question. Forms that im told were submited were never submitted. When I check on status of what counts as income changes depending on who I talk to.

Today I'm driving to Sacramento (a 2 hour drive) to get one simple issue (income verification) done. Edd took it upon themselves to verify my income as 600 something for the entirely of 2019. I never said that was my total income for 2019, and I've been getting the run around for weeks now. When I submitted my 1099 that proves my 2019 Income was 60 something times higher than the 600(ths they put in) I still got the run around and different answers.

My cell phone provider is on the verge of shutting off my phone, and im using what little I have to drive to Sac to fix this. I am in this situation, because no one did their job correctly, or if at all.<//Text>

<review>I find it very helpful that during this pandemic and thousand (if not more) of Californians are out of work, Unemployment thinks it is a grand idea to only work 8 am to 12 pm.  They created a call center for technical support however they can not fix any issues, you still need to contact the customer service number.... oh wait they never answer. Shocker!  They seriously need to get their act together.</review>< pics>

Absolute joke. If I could give -5 stars I would. I filed a claim 3.15.2020 and everything is still pending. I understand they're busy but it is physically impossible to get ahold of a person on the phone, you call right at 8am and it says they don't have enough people to answer the phone and just hang up. I have been emailing them at least once a week and no response despite the fact it says I'll get one in 5-7 days. I have no money, I relied on this to keep my bills paid until I could find something...<//Text>

I cannot certify my benefits and have not been receiving any of my benefits going 4 months now. It’s just keeps getting rejected. Every rep I get a hold of after 100+ calls can’t help with no usable Info. Suppose a speacialist is suppose to contact me but it’s been a few months now and I’ve answered every phone call that came in because I was told they’ll only call once. So far nothing!!!!! EDD better back pay for all eligible persons for there lack of process!!!</review>

REAL REASON WHY ANYONE  ISNT GETTING ANYWHERE  WITH EDD:
1. THEY'RE ALL WORKING FROM HOME WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO OVERRIDE ANYTHING.
2. NO OF THE REPRESENTATIVE KNOW WHAT THEYRE DOING. IVE CALLED ON SEPARATE OCASSIONS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE AND IT CAN'T BE RESOLVED UNLESS OVERRIDE FROM UPPER MANAGEMENT.
3. PENDING IN PAYMENT FROM 4 MONTH AGO MEANS THEY PUT PAYMENT  HOLD ON YOUR ACCOUNT.  BEING SENT MAIL TELLING ME I BEEN AWARDED BUT HAVE THEM TELLING ME I HAVE NO MONEY. WHEN INFACT I DO< /Text>

<review>The unemployment development department in California. Is the worst in the United states.  You can't get online. And when you call . They are too busy to answer. I called exactly when they opened and they are already too busy to answer. They need to clean house. And get a better system. They don't want to pay you your money. But when they want theirs.  they garnish you right away. We need to vote all these incompetent people out.<//review>< Pictures>

Anyone else filing their weeklys and edd not registering them through the system. No payment pending just a long list of we recieve your week for xxxx date. Even edd is aware of this happening because when i got ahold of someone from edd. The rep was telling me making sure they go through. Because edd online is not registering anything you send to them via website or mail<//Text>

I finally received my debit card after 13 weeks of certifying. On the card was 6 weeks of payments. I was so excited after waiting for so long. Then a few days later EDD messaged me on the website saying my account is suspended because they can't verify me. Ive sent the forms in multiple times and have called and called and called and still nothing.</Text>

They mixed my name up in the system when I filed for unemployment and now it’s my responsibility to prove my identity to them when they made the mistake. The number to contact customer support hangs up on you when you try to get a hold of an operator so I’m unable to get any assistance on my identity issue and left stuck to figure out my own situation. I’ve mailed my info to the integrity and accounting office but still can’t get a hold of them either as their phone line will also hang up on you. Such a bad system with no accountability on their end & it’s really irritating and not promising that they will do their part.< /review>

I know that they are getting a ton of calls but they don’t even give   the option to hold. Just get hung up on. Get another number to call and that number just hangs up on you.

I’ve gone online and filed my claim. I have questions still . Something is not right and only a live body can answer my questions as the answers are not obtainable online .

They’re supposed to be staffing  8 am to 8 pm  ,  7 days a week now…

I filed a claim on March 23. Just received the certification notice  for benefits. Unfortunately I don’t understand the dollar amount and why start  date of my unemployment benefits would be April 8?

I thought the first week we’re supposed to be waived  . Part of the stimulus package .

I also received a debit card with zero balance? Why? I feel sorry for the employees of EDD!</text>

Can’t seem to get a hold of anyone, just supposed to sit and suffer I guess while no one seems to be hiring at the moment. Been waiting for my pending payment for weeks. Nothing changed just stopped sendIng me my check out of nowhere. Thanks Gavin Newsom and EDD for not doing your job for the Californian people.</Review>

I watched a friend spend from 8a-12p and than after that trying to get ahold of EDD to open a new claim since his old claim was expiring. He got the notice in the mail 12/31/2019. Was told he had 1 day before 1/4/2020 to submit. He called every 5 minutes and got the same message. To many callers, try to call back again. Looks like California is trying to detour people from collecting the money they put into this system and the employers that also do the same. He is a seasonal employee that collects EDD a few months a year.< /review>

<Text>The Unemployment Department has opened many lines to better assist us but as soon as they open the phone lines say they cant take any calls. The Government has to fix this issue . I applied in april when I was laid off and the system is not working it has asked me to reopen 4 times. I sent over 10  emailed questions and they cant ever respond. this tells you that they dont care. This is my only source of income right now due to the pandemic and guess will have to go live under a bridge soon till they decide to fix the issue. will give them a '0' star......disapointment with this issue..California should look into the way the representatives are handling their work or cases...</Text><Time>1592499015238< /Time>< rating>

During this pandemic we can get ahold of no one, they have been processing my husbands claim since April 06,on April 21 They sent us a paper saying they needed proof of I D documents which we sent that same day. Now it’s May 26 and we still have nothing and can’t get ahold of anyone to help! Beyond frustrating!<//review>

Went through all the hoops to be told at the end I had zero benefits. NOW last week they start talking about this new PUA program for self employed and we can apply on April 28th. How stupid is it that they didn't tell us to wait to apply!! Now when I apply for this can they use all the information about me that they have? Or am I starting over!! Cant wait for Tuesday.< /Review><name>Marilyn Kasko< /name>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This is the first time I have ever had to apply for any assistance, and I was hesitant to do it at all.  I understand that with all the budget cuts the State has been forced to process claims with a reduced workforce, and with the current situation it is even more difficult.  I was let go from work on the 9th and started this process on the 14th of May.  I submitted all the necessary documents and to date I have not received any benefits.  I have made repeated attempts to obtain information on the benefit amount as it has a direct impact on my application for medical insurance.  I was given a deadline of today to provide the information to Covered CA, however I have not been successful in reaching a representative to provide me with the information.  The state can and should request that any retired former employee be given the opportunity to return on a part time basis to assist with the influx of UI and SDI claims, this is not a difficult thing to do, since we are in an emergency situation it would provide those of us requesting information to communicate with an individual that can assist.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had call more than 100 times to at least 7 different phone numbers and at different times of the day I only heard recordings with the same message, today someone answer the phone after more than 30 attempts to tell me the systems are down I can’t help you! The worst thing nobody cares nobody gives a dame! You are a nobody! Politicians only use us to their shows on tv just talking but no action, shame on you, shame in all of you that have the authority to make a change but choose to be mediocre...<//Review>

*If you are filling for a Military claim you are unable to file online.
When you print the application they have you send it Via Fax with a copy of your DD214. the site does not specify which copy you need.
Send in your "DD214 MEMBER 4" if not you will not get paid. If you submit the Service 2 you will wait for 3 weeks to find out you have to mail in your Member 4.< /Review>

They have not responded to any of my official requests for information... I literally can’t get a hold of anyone! And there is no opportunity at all to talk with a real person, and I have plenty of questions and concerns that I would like to voice to a real person. Ridiculous!< /review>

This is the worst customer service I've never experienced.  Yes, I said NEVER experienced because I have yet to speak to anyone.  I call before 8am they say they are closed, I call exactly at 8am and they say they don't have enough representatives to help.  Don't say you've amped up your ability to handle calls, NO YOU HAVEN'T.  We are in the middle of a pandemic, I've lost my job and have no income.  I filed for unemployment 2 MONTHS AGO and haven't received ANYTHING.<//text>

California EDD is impossible to get a hold of.  I had to move out of state, they asked to Identify myself, I sent papers. They say they never received, then I send again to a Adjudication center, that moved from Elk grove. My paperwork sent return receipt, it is still waiting to be accepted.  I am about to file a Mail Fraud Complaint. The US Post Office Agrees and is will.  They say EDD didn't change their address in time, and now mail is just backed up. You people need to stop screwing around, and get to work. I am sure many would replace you for what you get paid in cash and benefits.</Text>

I went to the EDD office some time ago to get some paper work done and when got close to the window nobody was on the phone , so I said to myself let me see if someone answers the phone a, I called and sure enough, no one picked up the phone. Everyone was just sitting there doing nothing as far I can see. Don't get they do answer the phone periodically, but come people stop playing with peoples lives here.< /review>

The absolute worst and most frustrating experience I have ever had. Their phone lines are busy every time I call and I have been calling for the past week multiple times a day. They do not have some services online and make you call them.

It is a disgrace that they can not serve the people when they need it.</text>

EDD is terrible at the very very lowest point they can be. It is unprofessional and unrealistic to have a process that involves repeated phone interview calls. First time they call , they question why amazon a large employer has fired someone. Next you have to send many demanding email response to edd demanding answer. Now, they stop the claim process and tell you to continue to claim weeks. This the shameful process I’ve ever seen with edd. EDD WILL HEAR FROM ME AS WELL AS THE STATE , LABOR COMESIONS BY ALL MEANS NECESSARY.  UNTILL I AM BACK PAID FOR WAITING FROM APRIN TO NOW.

WHAT A SHAME THEY ARE. MY. OMPLAINT WILL BE HEARD AND DUE PROCESS WILL BE DEMANDED.< /text>

The EDD’s call in system is purposefully set up to keep you from talking to a representative with certain options taking you to an irrelevantly informative message and then not giving you an option to go back to the main menu. Further more, the options listed tend to be information you can simply look up online with no option to speak to a representative when those don’t apply to your question. If you manage to find an option to talk to a representative about a semi related topic, you will normally be told that there’s no one available to take your call and the phone will hang up on you. If you do actually get ahold of a representative, they are pretty helpful, if not a little rude, but the system needs to be fixed so you don’t have to pick an option that’s completely irrelevant to your question so you can talk to someone.</review>

I am glad I read the reviews.  For two hours, I bounced between phone numbers with phone tree options which were irrelevant to my question.  I called a local office and spoke to the human who answered the phone, and she could only refer me to the telephone number which I had already called.  Her office did not "handle" my issue.   if there was ever an exercise in futility, this was it...< /Text>

<review>Only open via phone from 8 to noon? The state is trying to limit access and; thusly, limit the payouts to poor Californians. This system sucks!

The wait times on the phone are long, sometimes too long and you are disconnected without warning.

Need a solution fast? Too bad. Don’t have access to a computer, which they’re constantly telling you to use on the automated line? You’re out of luck. Want to speak with a human face to face. Never going to happen.

Being in poverty is awful. Being made to struggle is even worse.</review>< Pictures>

Yup... hated it. You can't get through on the phone. The communications are one way if there are any at all. The funds are so delayed, I am not surprised people are on the street!  I am still waiting for the form to fill out from July!!! and it is the end of November... yes same year...ha!
I agree - the persons who work in this system are doing themselves and CA a disservice and the ones at the top should all have to go through the process!!<//text>

<Review>If y'all made a version of the UI online site that actually works, you could probably cut down on the call volume significantly. I've been locked out of the site for a month (password reset function doesn't work), I've attempted to call for help dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and every time I get hung up on. Literally all I need is my password reset, which is something that shouldn't even require a human to help me.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

They give you bad advice. I went there so they could help me get a job in the state, it's been years with no calls. I asked folks who work with the state and they told me the advice given to me by the EDD was total BS. I don't really think they're interested in helping you.<//Text>

<review>It's amazing. They have no issues and no hiccups pulling money out of your check, but when you try to file a claim all of a sudden they are the most inept group of paste eaters you've ever talked to. First, their phone line is open from 8am - noon? Who does that? Second, even after filing to have bi-weekly validations through the mail, my wife's claim was closed after one week and we never recieved any paperwork or notice that anything was wrong.
Like just about every other state run agency, these people would be fired if they worked anywhere else.
Which might be a good thing, then they could experience how rediculously stupid their department is to deal with.<//review>< Name>

Wow, just wow.  I can't believe a government agency like EDD has no one working the phone system.  After calling and calling and calling trying to reach an actual human being, I get through on one of their numerous phone numbers just to be told that the phone line is full and to call back another time.  (And the phone bank hours are 8am to 12pm)   The fact that there are so many people complaining about this on google and nothing seems to have been addressed is beyond me.<//Text>

<review>Usually this Carl's is great but Thursday at 11:00 some man was working drive thru and tried to rip me off taking a $10 gift card and  telling me it had $1 on it. Asked for receipt and it did not reflect any gift card whatsoever. I will never go back despite stellar service prior.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

Ok now today i went through the Drive-through and after going here for years i was extremely pleased by this employee’s customer service that i decided to write this review in hopes he gets acknowledged. I don’t know his name but he was so polite and so friendly, with a smile on his face the whole time he was attending us. On the receipt it doesn’t have his name but he was the young guy attending the drive through today 11/6/19 about 9:40am, he deserves a raise.< /review>< pics>

Every time I come the burgers and spicy chicken are so dry. The tenders are dry and barely warm so even after I ask for fresh ones when obviously they’re not fresh. My jalapeño poppers are always popped. And to top it off the cashier always gives me attitude and never greets.</review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>One of the worst experiences I've ever had.  The guy working the drive thru window charged me for the wrong order after I told him the amount was wrong. He blew me off and charged my card anyway. Then the girl in charge tried to fix it but did a refund instead of voiding the charge.  That means I have to wait 3 to 5 days to get my money back. It's  not about the $19 dollars, it's the fact that they take the money right away but take much longer to give it back. It's the principle of the matter, especially since it was their mistake. The transaction should've been voided. Then the same guy who messed up in the first place practically throws my food at me. He never said hello, never read my order back to me, never looked me in the eye,  didn't ask me if I wanted any condiments and never said thank you. So he doesn't pay attention to what he's doing and has some of the worst customer service EVER!</review>< userid>

<Text>Every restaurant has something that makes them the place to go to.  I mean, I go to McDonalds and Jack in the Box but there is a huge difference.   You gotta go there to find out why you should buy their hamburgers.  To make it easier and motivate you to go, they give coupons.  My wife and always go Carls for a hamburger after going to the theaters and until now, I have not been disappointed.

As always, do not forget if you want to sell, buy a property or modify a loan, I am here to help and you can find me on facebpok and on my picture you will find my information.< /Text>< pics>

Very clean place, friendly staff, and the food is great. Pretty lonely so you won't get bothered. Close to elac South gate so if you go to school there you can stop by for a quick grub.<//review>

Yummy fried zuquini. Having breakfast burrito coffee. Breakfast time. Well it's 6:07 waiting for Carl's Jr to open. They already lost client's that left. Due to not opening early. They say open at 6:00am,  I'm really hungry I need to take medicine. Finally they just opened. Darn why can't they be on time.</review>

Fast service, friendly staff. My brother had to return his order twice because the burgers weren't made how he had ordered them. I'll be coming back because I enjoyed the burgers.</Text>

The hamburgers are ok, but the buns
Are a problem, very distasteful. And,
The cheese burgers are to small. The
Chicken pieces, are execelent and

I spent over $30 at Carl's jr. And they refused to give me 1 BBQ sauce unless I paid 27 cents for one.... and the only reason I needed BBQ was because their western bacon cheeseburger (a burger that should have BBQ sauce) was drier than hell

Think about this, the owner makes thousands to hundreds of thousands a month. Yet we the  middle class are forced to eat the costs? How much does it cost the owner per packet 5 cents? Maybe even 10 cents? So ur saying this cheapskate owner is turning over a %200+ markup on BBQ sauce lol?

Employees are fine, it's just whoever is making decisions at the top definitely is doing it wrong< /Review><rate>1<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Normally you guys get it right but today was given the wrong burger at drive thru. Still going back but next time I’ll look in the bag before driving off.

Had initially given 4 stars, but the criss cuts were cold and hard as a rock smh<//Review>

Took 15 minutes from the time I arrived at the drive-thru lane to the time I finally received my food...that's way too long of a wait time. The cashier wasn't paying attention as I repeated my order twice for him. SMH.</Review>

Please re-train all your people, one way or another they tend to screw up the order. This is why every time I go to Carl's there is never a line, the crew is lost. I ordered a Sausage biscuit today and when I got to work thinking I'm going to eat this delicious flavorful biscuit turns out it was bacon(I don't like Bacon....Really Carls Jr??? Please try better, this is not the first time...smh< /Text>

The service in this place is very slow. One time it took them 20 mins for one hamburger. Another time it took them 15-18 mins for a chicken sandwich. The place was not even busy at the time. I recommend going through the drive-thru, it is much faster.< /text>

Drivethrw sux the workers always ask me to park, Even if its a small order. (2019) I tryed this place again and simple orders are apparently the hardest for them. SKIP THIS LOCATION!! Unless your ok with getting your food 10-15min later and hear the workers blaming each other on who skipped (bumped is the word they used) the order.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is a unprofessional and a ripoff. I ordered a oreo cookie shake and got a cup only 2/3 full the rest whip cream. When I aaked what's up with it being improperly served....they just said that's how it is and shrugged.  They charged me full price so I expect a full serving.<//text>

They built this in 09 I believe and the one closests Carls Jr here around Boyle Heights. I miss this one lady who worked here even though her voice was squeeky and high pitched .When ever Id come here and had a coupons she would hook it up not using one coupon but 2-3 at times :). Those fatty days of 2009-2012 x) I have to come back here soon because of the burgers and offers.<//Review>

Messed up my order but didn’t realize it until I got back. When I returned, instead of the burger being replaced, it was taken in the back, wiped off, and handed back to me... cold, slimy, and smelling awful. The fries were cold and over cooked as well.</text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent Burgers The Detail
It's a lot of Wait at Drive Thu Today
Sunday July 12, 11:00 pm, maybe it will be
Due to lack of Personnel their Reasons will have.
What was missing when I went home look I miss
A hamburger ordered and pay for 2 combos
Only one is missing the hamburger, pa
Returning is a little withdrawn and it's night
You should be more careful with that thanks.

Excelente Hamburguesas El Detalle
Es mucho Espera en Drive Thu Hoy
Domingo Julio 12, 11:00pm, talvez sera
Por falta de Personal sus Razones tendran.
Lo Que Faltaba al yegar a casa mire me falto
Una hamburguesa pedi y pague 2 combos
Solo que a uno le falto la hamburguesa, pa
Regresar esta un poco retirado y es noche
Deben de tener mas cuidado con eso gracias.<//text>

And apparently enters with the manager. The lady goes out and tells me that her manager can only help me BACK THE MONEY OH MAKING ANOTHER HAMBURGER FOR ME !!!!!
Is seriously!???? And the pain of my tooth! At least one apology from the manager but she didn't show her face.
But well I do not return to this restaurant and luck to those who stop there!

(Translated by Google) The truth is, I do not think I will return a sauce, for a $ 10 breakfast they sell it extra for 27 cents, when in other fast food establishments it is included.
