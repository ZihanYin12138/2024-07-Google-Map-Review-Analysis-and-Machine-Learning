Tasty pasties that are a good size for lunch. I'll definitely be back to try a few other flavors. My Wife had the broccoli and cheese(the veggie one was out that day), I the beef and my Son had the chicken one.<//review>

<text>Been eating Marshall's Pasties since I was a kid. The crust is always perfect and the stuffing tasty. Excellent comfort food! Tried the gravy on it for the first time today and it was great, but personally I prefer ketchup and vinegar. :) Marshall's has been around a long time, and for a darn good reason. Great food, great service.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1baPVoQwu2_d-0_c2dlMQfTfjETYZyzF0ajo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXFfgJqZqT4Ni0PLeCk1LEONWFYgCNgHZ7Tcs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

I work downtown and this is my go-to spot! I eat here probably 2x a week! The ladies who work here are very kind, and they make the BEST pasties in town! So delicious!< /Text>

Friendly service but the pasties were severely underbaked with grey looking dough. Filling was also meh. We drove from a ways away so it was disappointing.< /review>

DELICIOUS. Love the varieties and the fact that you can pick small or large sizes. Their sausage pasties are excellent, as are the turkey. The crust is flaky, buttery deliciousness and complements the fillings perfectly. Do yourself a favor and save room for an apple dessert pasties. Prices are very reasonable. Just an FYI, they are cash only!< /Text>

<Text>Good service but the food is simply not worth it. Take the veggie pastie, it tastes like boiled nothing. Add some flavors! Add some spice! Add curry, make the dough thinner and crispy, bake to order.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>The pasties are delicious and well worth $5.95 for a regular size pastie. Perfect amount of food for lunch at this price. My husband will order 2 on a hungry day because he eats more but will only get half way through the second unless he's really hungry.
The only downfall is they are reheated which makes the crust a little less flakey when using a microwave but if you reheat at home in the oven or half microwave and half toaster oven, it turns out more flakey and delicious!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I used to get local cornish pasties when I lived in northern Michigan (one of the origin places of the pasty) these are the closest to legitimate pasties I have found. It's amazing. You can get frozen or heated, buy in bulk or just one for a meal. They are very nice people. Don't go anywhere else!!!<//Review>< Pics>

Ooops!  Ran out of stars - I'd go beyond 5.  Having lived in England for over 30 years (and spent much time in Cornwall), Marshall's is my "go-to" pasty place.  Quaint, authentic and tasty - please pass the vinegar."< /Text>

<text>I really wanted to love this place, because I drove a 1/2 an hour to get here. I love pasties.  I just didn't love these pasties. I grew up loving them, and that's one of the reasons I wanted to love these. I've been looking for a great place to find great pasties, and so far, no success.
There was a lot of meat and a lot of potatoes inside and the crust was palatable.  The problem was that they are just too dry. You should be able to just pick them up and eat them maybe have something to drink with them, but not necessarily. With these pasties,  You must slather than in gravy, have something to drink, ladel them with butter, or something.  They are just so very dry!
After hearing about this place and having wanted so very much to love them, I was so very disappointed that they weren't great as I had heard. I will keep looking for a really good pastie place.</text>< Pictures>

I grew up in Nevada City and LOVED me some Marshall's Pasties! Whenever I return home to visit (30 years later) we make sure to buy a dozen, and bring a frozen dozen back to Pennsylvania with us to enjoy. You just can't get these anywhere on the east coast that I have found. Highly recommended<//Review>

Great pasties. You definitely need gravy with it. A bit too many potatoes even for a self proclaimed potato lover</review>

My mother made these until she passed away and Marshalls have the closest thing to hers.  Delicious and filling and they freeze extremely well.  I make a  trip from the Bay Area just to stock up on them.<//review>

CASH ONLY. Small shop off one of the side streets in downtown Grass Valley. Came here because I thought I'd try something different and because of all the reviews.

Pasties are pastry-covered, little "pies" that are normally savory, but they offer an apple one here. Known as the national dish of Cornwall in the UK, they were popular in this neck of the woods as miners from Cornwall came out here to try out their gold finding luck. Pronounced "pa-stee" as opposed to "pay-stee" -- those little things that strippers are found of. (But to be fair, a stripper could be partial to both.)

You can order pasties in a smaller size or regular. I recommend the regular, if you're kind of hungry. If you are really hungry, you might need two! The price for a regular size averaged about $4.95 or so.

They had choices of beef, chicken, vegetable, broccoli and cheese, apple, and I know I must have missed a couple of other ones. My daughter, being vegetarian, ordered the vegetable one and she could taste a distinct fridge flavor, so she wasn't too thrilled about that. I had the beef - the meat portion seemed more like broken up beef sausage, not mincemeat or steak cubes.

I ordered an apple one to try at home. They packed it with some icing that was delicious! Although the pasty itself had fridge flavor to it. I was advised to heat up in the microwave, but I stuck it in the oven as I wanted my pastry on the flakier side.

The seating area is tiny! So you may not be able to score a place to sit down. I noticed that they probably do a brisk business with catering orders, etc. as they sell cocktail pasties, a dozen for $14. I'd come back to get some of those if I was having a gathering!< /text>

This is by far the worst place to get your nails done. They also charge for every single thing. These people are not properly trained. They will mess your eyebrows up.< /text>

Do not come here. By far my worst experience. They hurt your skin a lot. And it’s like they rush it through. Also very rude and if you don’t like something they give you attitude and make you feel uncomfortable. Acrylic nails are not nice at all. I got mine done and didn’t like them at all.</review>

Well this place use to be my go to spot for my acrylics and pedi's. They just lost a customer for what happened to me on 7/28/19. Went to get my brows and cheek bones waxed and the wax was so hott in burned my skin! They didn't offer an apology or refund for one, then the manager in charge said "oohh it'll heal in 3-4 days." I use to come get my acrylics done here every 2 weeks but after 4 months I started noticing they wouldn't last a week very fragile and easily would pop right off, as if they used cheap products. Maybe they do since their prices are cheap as hell. I then decided to make this spot ONLY my main pedicure spot because the guys here are really good with taking out my ingrown toe nails. But they weren't obviously doing a great job because in 2 weeks it was ingrown again and had to do them again. Plus big thing here i notice they NEVER CLEAN THEIR TOOLS and USE THE SAME TOOLS ON EVERYONE, they don't even wipe them off with alcohol! Which is AGAINST STATE BOARD LAWS!!! and cause of that i also have fungus now on my feet now. Do yourselves a favor ladies and gentlemen avoid this spot!!! I understand times are tough and its an affordable spot, but pay for quality not quantity.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I came here to get a pedicure. It's been hours since I got them done and my nails are still burning. She cut me two times and used the same utensils she used on me with someone else without cleaning them. My cousin got her nails done and the lady cut all of her cuticles. She didn't ask what shape or length she wanted for her acrylics. While I was waiting for her to be done, this other customer came in and everyone was being rude to her. Don't come here save your money. The other customer also got a pedicure done and they cut her she was bleeding so much. The prices aren't updated, so they end up charging way more than what is posted on their walls.<//review>< pics>

The only reason why I giving them a 3⭐️ because only Ana knows that she is doing. She is good on doing mani, pedi and eyebrows. The rest of them are just lazy and sloppy. You need to be on them and tell them exactly what you want if not they are going to try and charge you extra. My mom normally goes with me but yesterday she decide to go on her own they did a horrible job who pays $40 for just eyebrows and pedi. I guess because she does not speak English they fooled her. I’m really disappointed. Like I said only ANA knows what she doing. The guys are so sloppy and always rushing it.</review>

Most painful ridiculous experience I've ever had at a salon. I should have known when it was empty. Getting my acrylic fixed, the man wasn't going to put a tip on. He was rushing and kept getting my skin. The colors they give you to choose from look nothing like what you're getting. The pedicure took skin off my toes so much so that even the oil burned. Halfway through I just wanted to leave. Now that my nails are painted I realize they haven't asked for payment so I have to risk smudging my nails to pay for something i wish never happened. I offered $20. More than they deserved. I was told I should have said something (I did) then told I was too picky. They would not let me leave so I had to give in.   Do yourself a favor and stay away.<//review>

<review>I really wish I can put no stars they over charge you speacilly if they know you haven't been there before they charge me 32.00$ for a pedicure and the sign on the door says 17.99 for pedicure and manicure and when you ask about they say the sign is old than take it down and when I went back inside to see how did I go from 13 to 32$ they act like they can't understand English they kept saying I paid for 10 extra for nail polish I think they just got over but it's ok never again I don't think this is no good nail shop at all<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2c91126203be3:0xa0866da8c8ab013e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Bad bad bad.... Got my acrylic nail's done in this place... It was all empty just like a single female here but i decided to get my nails done here bcs it was getting late and i have went to burger king to eat but i first went to get my nails done bcs i seen this place so i decided to go in and the guy was so in a damn rush they didn't even do my nails good. The 2nd or 3rd day 2 of my nails fell off i didn't even have chance to go back and tell em anything bcs it was my b-day but it's okay all i know is that i'm not coming back to this cheap wack place anymore super bad bad... Stay away from this place they also put acrylic in my skin while they was doing my nails and they looked horrible and they leave em super thiiiiin i told them why i had acrylic in my skin and they said "oh just wipe off with nail remover"... Even the lady worker from burger king they have told me to don't ever get my nails done in this place bcs it's horrible... They just steal ur money it's just dumb.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2c91126203be3:0xa0866da8c8ab013e<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Little professional I use an acetone for me and then put it in the boat again, use the same product for everyone, and they say a price and when they finish the job is another, that speaks very badly of them I am a tourist from Los Angeles and that is saw badly!

<Text>This place has really really great food for a really great price. I've tried just about everything and have never been disappointed, my favorite though is a extra large Graziano's special pizza with extra sauce and extra cheese, you just can't get a better pizza.</Text>< pics>

What can I say, this place is da bomb ! The food is awesome and the staff is always friendly. We get all of our food for our company meetings for this place and we are never disappointed, the food is fantastic, especially the lasagna . I come eat here for lunch as well and the service is fast and friendly. I am sure glad that a simple restaurant like this still exists where you can get a great meal and great service at a fair price.<//Review>

Best pizza in mira loma! Just how I remember it when I was a kid and my parents took me every Friday to get pizza and a movie. Haven't been there in 13 years moved to Anaheim and I moved back and decided to stop there with family and it's just how I remembered it. My kids loved it and can't wait to go back</Review>

<review>This pizza place has been in jurupa valley since 1980. The pizza and all the menu items still taste the same in the past 40 years.  I recommend there bread sticks with mozzarella they are excellent. There pizzas are great as well, the salads are fresh and they put a little mozerella on top.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Great tasting pizza. Appreciate that they customized my pizza when I asked for buffalo chicken pizza that's not on their menu. They delivered it directly to our karaoke room. Wings were delicious too. Highly recommend!Graziano's is my go to for lunch during the week. Their special is great yet light on the pocket. The personal pizza is great with fresh ingredients. Tasted the sausage/meatball combo sandwich a few times and the sauce is great. Italian Sub is on point as well! The staff is great and feel like family after a while.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating><name>Alejandro Dorothy<//name>< pictures>

This is the 2nd time I have an extremely bad experience with Janet, the cashier.  The 1st time I called and asked for the specials she replied in a very rudely manner "it's the same specials we've always had." This being the 1st time I ever order from them,i dont know their menu. Today I call and ask what the ETA is for pick up, she said "I dont know you have to order thru online" again I asked for the ETA for pick up not delivery, she replied "please hold" and hung up on me!!!! I called back and asked to speak to the manager, she said she was the manager. When I asked to speak to corporate or owner she refused to give me information and again said please hold and hung up on me!!!! Anyone know information on owner so I can email or call to put in a complaint against her? This is not the 1st time and I'm sure it wont be the last. Sad because their food is great but with their customer service business will start hurting.</Text>

<review>This place has great, "almost" New York style pizza. The Deluxe is my fav. But watch out if they run your credit card more then once and they tell you it didn't go through. I was charged 3x for the same pizza, plus I paid cash in the end. I had to open a claim with my bank to get my refund</review>< Pics>

Excellent pizzas and pasta. The food are beyond great and tasty. Haven't eaten such quality pizza for a while and the cheesy lasana is godsend!  The only down side is the staff were too busy with every other table was left uncleaned after customers left (our table was clean though). Will come again.<//text>

This is a very good place for dining and for take out. Starts with great pizza. Very authentic New York style pizza. They also have great pasta dishes and good sandwiches. They have nightly specials during the week. Also a dinner for four with pizza salad and pasta for 25 bucks. It is in a strip mall, but is very good for dining in or take out.</review>

Super rude ppl. They somehow forgot my ticket and then then didn’t apologize or try to fix it, they just handed me my money back. I do not recommend going here.<//Text>

<text>I've been here before and like other user's reviews I agree with the comment that the usual cashier lady is very rude. When I asked her what the lunch special was she asked me to go out and read the board, but I went back because the food was good. Today I ordered their lunch special. Pizza with a salad. THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY SALAD! So I let the staff know that there was a hair in my salad and the cashier (there was a nice lady this time) asked me if I wanted another salad, but I just gave her back both the pizza and the salad and asked for my money back. She takes it to the back and then the cook (old dude with mustache) approaches me and tells me that he will give me back the money for the salad, but not the pizza. He told me the boss was checking the cameras and when I asked for the boss he told me he had called his boss. I knew he was just lying. He was very rude. He went back to the kitchen and told the cashier to give me back all my money. At this point it was not about the money, but the horrible experience from the hair and his attitude. They have lost a customer for not knowing how to handle the situation with kindness and respect.</text>< pics>

After jojo's closed down we needed to find a new restaurant pizza. It's just ok. Maybe marginally better than the high volume big chain pizza places. The crust was on the thin side for my liking and was a bit chewy, like it had been worked too long and the gluten over developed. Cheese seemed a bit on the cheap side and the sauce was a bit boring for my family.
I think hight top pizzas from Blaze will be our new local pizza of choice.< /Text>

<Text>Yea, I've been eating there for years, the sandwiches used to be REAL good, but lately have gone down hill. That little paisan sandwich maker skimps on meats, even when you ask and pay for more, bread is good though. Pizza is good, sometimes they really skimp on toppings though, I think when John is there, which is usually Fri-Sun. Nice guy, never had any problems there. As long as he has been there, he needs to change the place, you know, update it a bit, same menu, unchanged for a LONG time, maybe new items, update the decor somewhat too. But overall, I will continue to chow down there.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The lady at the front who takes orders is the most rude person I've ever met. When I asked her for her name she refused to give it to me unless I told her what my complaint was. She refused to give me the owners name and number. I don't understand how she can be so rude and still work there. It must be family owned. Will not go to that location ever again.<//Review>

Located in the Stater's shopping center on Limonite. We puled up in front & could smell th garlic when we got out of the car & knew this was going to be good food. Looks like a little mom & pop pizza place but delivers high end Italian flavors. They serve everything from Pizza (up to 28-inch) to Subs... Great pasta dishes.. Spaghetti, manicotti, lasagna & more. The lasagna is our favorite.. they use real Mozzarella & ricotta cheeses. They also have many different salads to choose from. Graziano's has a Calzone that is bigger than the plate. The place is clean (a-rating). Staff very friendly & efficient. The prices are reasonable for the portion sizes & they have a lunch special for 5.95 with many items to choose from. In all a great little place for a nice meal.</Text>

Bad customer service.
We asked for two types of dressing for our group's salad and they said no, they actually told us they might be able to give us a half cup of each though if we really wanted the variety... How cheap is that...
We walked in with a group and the woman that greeted us was very nice and personable. When we were ready to order another lady stepped up to the cash register and was extremely rude. She berated us for asking a question about their special they were offering that night and after some other issues we decided to just leave. Needless to say she was quite rude about us leaving instead of completing our order as well.< /Text>

I've been getting pizza from them for over 18 years and they have never disappointed me, they are always very kind and are willing to do what they can to make you happy, to anyone who thinks they were rude to you, you better check you're own attitude, they are never rude unless you have an attitude with them which I can completely understand after being in customer service for 8 years and counting... Excellent pizza, fair prices, great attitude, couldn't ask for more<//Text>

I wasn't impressed. I've had way better pizza's for less money..They added a take out fee on my bill because I ordered the Monday special. So I'd say after the fee it wasn't much cheaper than what they charge any other day.. The lady that took my order was rude. It was my first time and my last time going there..<//text>

<Text>I came to Grazianos to try something different and I was disappointed. I have 3 daughters and they don't drink soda. I asked for three waters and the lady in front told me she could only give me two... I didn't think much of it. But when my brother order his food for his family they asked him if he would be sitting on the same table.... my brother said that he was and he was denied 2 more cups for water.  How can someone call this place a family restaurant when they make you feel bad about eating in this place.. I will never come back to Gracianos Pizza ever again.. Yoyos pizza has better service....< /Text>< pictures>

An Absolute local favorite for almost 40 years. Grazianos Pizza is that quintessential neighbourhood Pizza Parlor with a top notch staff ... Utilizing the best ingredients ... From Pizza to Pastas and a long list of Sandwiches insures their legacy pass from Generation to Generation.</Text>

Really Rude service.   The lady has no people skills.   I understand that is closeing time but there's a proper way to ask us to leave.  Rude to just yell and ask us to throw our trash and leave.   I will never go back.<//text>

<Date>1617002509239<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Lisa's nails is the only place where you can find lisa! No one does nails the way she does! I had to get my nails done out of town once and I found a place with good ratings and went there for a full set. I remember thinking, "wow this is taking really long to just do the setting of my nails, she hasn't even started on my nail polish yet and its been over an hour, who ever gave the review's  must have never had their nails done by someone like Miss. Lisa!💥💯🥰🤗  because when I had to wait 2 hours for the lady to finish doing a full set of nails and they were not even painted with any special design or anything fancy that way, just the color only. I was so disappointed how much time was wasted and even though it was better than nothing, they were not even close to what Lisa dose in less time. I used to think how she was so expensive, but trust me when I say it is very, very much worth it!! Not only can she get a full set of any kind of nails you want in less time than anything I have yet to experience from anyone else but her work in the end is completely beyond impressive and always looks amazing! Even if lisa dose leave me with a bit of bumps or something might be off a tiny bit... because no one is perfect, however I rather take that imperfect look because I feel that 1.) I'm only noticing those things. 2.) They still are really amazing. 3.) I I didn't sit there for over 2 hours to end up with really ugly nails that I still has to pay for. So from this point on I will wait to see only her or someone she has trained. Also I live out of town from her now and I still take that trip to see her. She is totally worth it!!😘🤩😍💯💥💥< /Text>< pictures>

Gave them a 2nd chance and definitely was not impressed. They aren’t very caring with their work, nor do they seem to even care... I wanted a design on my toe and she brought stickers out 🤦🏻‍♀️ Definitely not a place I’d recommend..< /Text>

Long story short, I came here only to remove my gel nails and left with 3 broken/torn nails (broken where they attach to the skin) and having to finish the job at home filing them down. When I sat down there were fake nails on the table as well as nail dust but worse than that there was an actual torn off human nail 🤮.The lady who was removing the gel for me was tearing my gel off with her bare fingers instead of filing them off with a machine which I usually get done.  Just a horrible experience. Needless to say I'm never stepping foot there again and not recommending it to a living soul. The pictures I included were a few days after my nails had a chance to grow out (she clipped them off very close to the skin) but you can see the tears/breaks and still some gel left on them...oh well. I just hope they improve.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-IAq6GpGyrGejASb0hIwWGe4I2tnULqt3vUmn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Lisa did my nails and rushed. They came out lumpy and crooked. I actually came home and filed off the polish and filed all the lumps down so they would be smooth. What a waste of money!!! I am sticking to doing my own with Poly Gel.<//Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I only got a pedicure here. She used tools that were not sanitized. She pulled them from her cart and they had obviously been used before on a different customer and when she was done with mine she washed them off in my dirty foot water and put them back in the cart for the next person. I only got the basic pedicure which was $25 but the description said she was supposed to massage my feet and legs and she just rubbed my legs for 20 seconds and that was it. I don't consider that a massage. I also had some dry heels and she charged me an extra $5 to scrub my heels with a USED pumice stone. I feel like scrubbing your feet with a pumice stone should be part of a regular pedicure and not an extra cost and the pumice stone should be brand new not used. Overall my toenails look fine but I don't get a pedicure for the nail paint I get it for the experience and massage otherwise I would just paint my own nails at home. Also they do not accept credit or debit cards only cash. But they have an atm machine you can use that charges you $1 to get out cash.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7rp6K6pAZ3QjTqE7gauYSoFzza0-FeVK98i-f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808517e3bc4e669b:0x523fe582c4128d48< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I went recently as they’re the only ones open, and the woman was nice but she painted my feet so poorly she put so many layers on my toes that it looks a mess and then my nails looked like I paid a 6 yr old to do them as my cuticles are painted and neither are my nails even .. waist of $85 for a mani and pedi don’t waist your time just wait for your nail salon to open back up after this pandemic.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>I only had my nails polished. Older lady didn't wipe my nails to remove any oil or lotion, rushed through the job, bumped 3 nails messing them up and did poor repair job. She forgot top coat on one of them. Not worth a dime of the $10 they charged me. Never going there again. If they can't do a simple nail painting,  I'd hate to see their other service.< /review>< user>

Their $$ is much more valuable than your time. I was left waiting an hour past my appointment time while A customer in frount of me, who was late,was provided additional services not scheduled. They thought I would wait because I was having eye lashes done. I had someone else do my nails and left without new eyelashes. Appointment tomorrow with a more reliable salon. Greed before customer service.< /text>

And the lady did them so fast and one messed up and she didnt even redo it she just painted right over it so it looked lumpy then she quickly had me dry my nails and they didn't even dry she just wanted me to pay her so she could go home. I ended up leaving with wet nails and had to come back quickly after because my paint messed up and lisa told me to come back the next day because everyone was busy and the lady who did my nails left for the day. I told her i would wait for someone and the lady who ended up re-painting them did a horrible job as well. Not worth the money. Would give them a negative 5 stars if I could.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808517e3bc4e669b:0x523fe582c4128d48</gmap_id>< Pictures>

Wish I could give this ZERO stars... Worst mani/pedi me and my daughter we ever had, did not last a full day.  They were more interested in watching some stupid YouTube or Facebook video than giving me and my daughter a decent manicure/pedicure.  Customer service was disappointing.  Will never go back and recommend that everyone else steer clear.<//text>

<review>I used to go to Lisa's back in 2007 and it was the best. Now it's just a piece of s#$%& it's not very cheap and for the nails to get air and bubbles it's aneceptable.. They don't even do a nice pedicure!.. It's honestly really nice but the skills are just soo poor.. There always on a hurry and i hateeeeee that Definitely not going there again.. They always had great reputation and I think that's exactly why they don't do a great job anymore!..

< Review>
I was not happy for three  major reasons:  they keep the mask on and talk to you never understanding what the neck they are saying, and you could see the lines under the gel or powder and the nail person didn't want to fix it...i will never go back and 45.00 is too much for a fill...<//Review>

This grocery shop was my favorite! I always go there because they have more selection, the prices, and the quality of what their products were great. Also, the staff working out there was very professional, nice, and lovely. They offered what was the best for the customers, and that was the thing I loved the most. Thank you so much!< /Review>

Great spot!

Pros: Produce, Meat, Deli, Liquor/Wine, Parking.

Cons: Small selection, prices.

Yes, it is more expensive than a regular grocery store, but you're paying for convenience here. The produce selection is great.

All the employees are friendly.</review>

Very long wait to order meat and it also very hot inside the store. I rate this a 4 because the prices of some items are overpriced.</review>

Some groceries almost out of date, most of the produce is started to spoil, highly priced. I did need a couple of groceries and produce, so I decided to buy. I do normally walk out when I see these items almost out of date, spoiled, or high priced.Fyi I don't steal.< /Text>

< review>
i used to go every week from palmdale just to buy meat there. My schedule no longer permits it. But the cuts on the meats and quality is second to none. Ot is a tiny market but very well stocked with a variety of pork, beef, chicken and even fish. They have taken the necessary steps to stay safe during covid and clean surfaces after each customer. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good cut of aguallon.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I like the meat of this place and the attention of almost all the staff with the exception of a butcher with a beard who always takes care of very bad smoke but everyone else very well.

Nice service.
Pizza was very good. The crispy pepperoni was great has a tiny bit of spice to it. Nice crispy crust. Great flavor all around. 100% would reccomend (a little pricey) but worth it.< /Review>

<text>Yummy pizza! We ordered the Robbers Roost, a good mix of ingredients EXCEPT too many olives. I am not an olive fan, but I’ll eat them on cooked on pizza. And this had too many, way too many, more than regular.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I called my order for delivery of the same pizza as I've been doing for years. I was informed that they are no longer delivering ok, I will pick it up.  As soon as I opened the box I was disappointed,  the veggies on the combination pizza were not cooked. Everyone felt the same. Also the crust was still gooey.  Needless to say that will be the last time for  Mountain Mike's. The 1 star is because it was hot.< /Text>< Pictures>

Tonight was my first time there I was very impressed, great big spacious, love that there was so many televisions loved the pool tables the staff was okay not mean or rude I guess just not very I'm not sure what the word is by guest friendly they were there to do their job and that's it if that makes any sense. The only thing that I really didn't like but there wasn't any soap in the restrooms and that the dispenser actually was broken and also I didn't like that there was only two options for the salad bar which was one time or to go I guess I just feel like for what you're paying it should be unlimited or that should be an option but other than that everything was great<//review>

I ordered 2 medium pizzas online. The service was fast and friendly. The pizzas were small for being medium but they were really good.</Text>

<Time>1516962413488< /Time><Review>GREAT atmosphere, great food, refreshing frosty beverages, competitive prices, and most of all incomparable service.  I was lucky enough to visit here during football season and was able to watch a full day of Sunday football.  And let me tell you, I had a blast.  From the cold beers, to the delicious pizza & wings, and the people.  I left there with an experience I'll remember for a lifetime.  I'm not from Bakersfield but everybody I met there made me feel like I was.  The establishment was clean, very spacious, had a big gameroom in the back with 2 pool tables, there was plenty of parking, wheelchair access, and the restrooms were well maintained throughout the day.  I would recommend stopping by if you are in Bakersfield, you'll be glad you did.  Oh, and if its football season, its an absolute MUST if you're in the area.  They had raffles, giveaways, and friendly football fans.<//Review><UserId.>111623316928772832088</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Had the lunch buffet today. Pizza was good salad bar was fresh. A couple things, no all you can eat salad bar. Just one trip for a buffet is not what I expected. Also no chicken on the buffet only wedges.
Customer service could be better. As the guy that helped us had a attitude as though he did not want to be there!< /review>

The food was a good effort with no wow factor. On the garlic pizza you couldn't taste the garlic. On the wings there was not enough sauce to taste. The salad bar was lacking. The place was very clean and well maintained. Nice friendly staff with a good game selection.</Text>

So servuce was not good place was empty not like they were to busy or packed to have customers sit to eat.

Very good pizzas, take advantage of their 40% off on all pizzas on Tuesday is worth it.</Text>

I don't know how to put it but it seems like a lot of happy people seem to visit this place that's why I guess it's always a little loud. Always laughing having a good time. Only thing is it's a little small< /Review>

Never had a problem with delivery before. Called tonight, total came out to 20.97. Was out on hold, the guy came back on the phone and said; "would you like an extra order of ranch because we can't do delivery if the order isn't over 20." I said the amount was 20.97 therefore it's over 20. He said " no it has to be out of the 20." Idiot, just and idiot. You get paid to do a job, do it and know math.<//text>

< Review>
This place is horrible the customer service  was very rude. 2nd there was 2 hairs in my pizza and all they said was "we can make you a large pizza", do you think I want another pizza after I found 2 hairs in my last one. Also it cost so much we ordered a Mountain pizza  (the largest one they have), a order of 6 piece of buffalo wings and 2 drinks and it cost almost 60 dollars. This place is horrible please don't come here.</Review>

The lady at the register answered rudely that they dont redund money. I didnt want a refund just wanted to let here know that if the games dont work then put a sign on it saying so. So customers like me dont find out the hard way that it doesnt work.after all this while she bought our puzza out she put it in a box abd left it on the counter till we asked her if it was oyr pizza abd she replied rudely yes.dont know if she was having a bad day but no way to treat a customer like that.used to be a good mountain mike customer but know WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN< /text>< GmapID>

Food is salty here. Pizza and wings are okay if you're hungry.  Wedges over priced.  Bathrooms are gross, always missing something, like seat covers or cleaning, with flooded toilets.   I just come here for the Raider Crusaider raffles.</text>

This is a super cute small business that we should be supporting! The owner is very nice and you can tell he wants to ensure the quality of his products and his service.

We got the matcha latte with whipped cream, mocha with whipped cream, salmon cream cheese on a jalapeno cheddar bagel, and a bacon pepper jack breakfast on sesame bagel. All of it was so good!!

Bye bye Starbucks! I am definitely going to be a return customer.

**Note: it is in a small plaza across the In N Out so it might be a struggle to get in< /text>

What a great little treasure hidden in a busy intersection. I ordered the dirty chai which comes with coffee ice cubes. Absolutely amazing! Friendly and kind folks that work there. I will be going back next time my wife has her appointment in Lake Elsinore.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>DELICIOUS COFFEE!!! Smooth espresso and tasty bagel sandwiches. Small little shop right off the freeway. Even though is just says COFFE SHOP on the outside this is Aroma D’Italia. The owner is Italian so he knows his coffee and if you wanna mix different types together he’s very knowledgeable.
My man and I are from Riverside 92509 area and are coffee fanatics and this is definitely a MUST TRY spot. There is a few tables outside but no indoor eating. So good - will be back soon.</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Absolutely love this place!
Great food, great coffee and great service.

Its not a quick in and out spot, and I admire that. Not sure his name, but the man that is there daily is so personable. Loves to serve his customers with the Italian hospitality.

So kind. If you haven't visited, definitely try them out!</Text>< Pics>

<review>Probably the worst experience I’ve had at a smaller coffee shop, and I’ve been to many. The man was very opinionated and didn’t care to express whatever it was he felt like. I was just coming in for my cup of coffee and didn’t ask for or care for his “advice”. Drinks were good but will not be coming back to this establishment. Will be missing out on a lot of the business I would have brought. Oh well, Starbucks works out just fine and is closer to home plus has kind baristas.< /review><time>1614637794711< /time>< user_id>

A must!!  Coffee 100%.  Breakfast sandwich 100%.  Cleanliness 100%.  Customer service 110%.  Massimo couldn’t have provided a better experience for us, a rarity these days.  We are so happy we stopped here.  We will be back.< /Review>

The first time we came here (3 weeks ago) I tried the caramel macchiatto and it was delicious, great balance between caramel and coffee. Today we returned and I bought a mocha and I was not disappointed. The chocolate was not overpowering and the coffee used tastes great 👌.</Review>

This is a small business owner in Lake Elsinore. Coffee choices were many and fresh. Staff professional and accommodating. We had a meeting there and they gave us some mini cupcakes which were yummy. They have bagels, donuts, and other breakfast items. They also do the fraps on ice or blended. We will definitely go back.</Review>

<Review>Love their coffee and the staff is very friendly. Reason for only a 3 star rating is I have gone to this place several times at around 1pm and they always seem to close earlier then what they have listed in Google as their normal business hours (2pm). This has happened on at least 3 different occasions.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The owner is also super chill. We didn't realize the store closed at 2 until we saw him bringing chairs in around 3.

Found this little gem of a coffee shop during our move into the area. I've had a Mexican Mocha and a blended Dirty Chai both were great. And you can taste the quality and care that goes into preparing said drinks. Also way better and more affordable than your local chain coffee shop.</text>

The true essence of the American dream and a small business.
I'm not big on different coffees but what I had here with my tasty breakfast bagel was perfect.

Truly great coffee! Very well priced as well. The Greek omelette breakfast sandwich was also fantastic and made fresh to order! Can't wait to come back!< /Text>

I randomly decided to stop by for some coffee during my shopping trip & decided to get a dirty chai. They offer coffee ice here, which I love! My drink was very well made, tasted delicious and the gentlemen who made my coffee was very friendly. I am going to make this place when I'm in the area. Highly recommend!< /review>< response>

Rushing to work is never fun.  I'm a traveling business lady and depending on where I am in a particular week governs which freeways in my area I will travel.

I must say that often when I'm headed into the South LA or Orange County areas, I make it a point to stop in and grab a delicious apple pie pastry.

It is always clean inside and people are always smiling when I walk in.  You must try the cookies too.  When the apple pastry isn't available...I'll snag six of those for later...to share of course.< /text>

<Text>Best coffee In Lake Elsinore! Came here with my wife. She got a cappuccino and I got an iced coffee and we both got the asiago bagel. I tried my wife's cappuccino and it was amazing! I never drink anything but black coffee so for me to say that it must be very good. My iced coffee had coffee cubes which is simply amazing. For anyone to take the time to do that means they take their business very serious and also shows the level of commitment. The owner was very nice and his customer service was top notch. Don't know why anyone would go to the coffee shop that stats with an S when you have this type of coffee shop near you. They also sell gelato, tea, and coffee. My wife bought a bag of camomile tea too. Will stop by here again for sure next time we are in the area.</Text><name>Charles H< /name>< UserId.>

< Review>
Found a 1985 Nighhawk 700S on Simi Valley Cycle's website.  Called and talked to Rick who was very helpful and honest about the condition of the bike.  I was 700 miles away but decided to take him on his word that the bike was in excellent condition.  My son and I drove down and it was as he said, perfect.  Rick was great to work with and it was a very easy and fast purchase.  Everyone at the shop was very nice and helpful. They helped me load it up in my truck and get me on my way back home.  All in all it was a great experience working with Rick and Simi Valley Cycle.  Only wish they were closer.< /Review>

Also, don’t listen to some of these negative reviews.  The entire team knows what their doing and are very friendly.  Not to mention their prices are amazing.  Set of tires cost me cheaper than ordering them online, AND they had them in stock, AND installed them the same day! (with a discount for buying them their) Can’t beat that.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Over the  years  I've purchased  from a lot  of  company's but  I  have to say dealing with Simi valley cycles has  been probably one of the  best  experiences  I've  ever  had , Rick  was   the  salesman  I dealt with and it was great, at  every level from  the  purchase  to the delivery  of  the quad and always responding  to calls . You guys  set  a standard  that others  should  learn from you, THANK YOU  SIMI VALLY CYCLES  AND  ALL THAT  HELPED  TO MAKE IT A SMOOTH DEAL.........JOHN HOLDER<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Bought my motorcycle from there recently and as soon as I walked in I felt at ease and unrushed, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Plus next door is a killer bbq spot. Both are a must visit.<//text>

"They are a genuinely nice and knowledgeable staff. I ride from Los Angeles to patronize Simi Valley Cycles. In 2019 I had an emergency right before a vacation. I damaged my tires hitting debris on the 101 freeway. They went out of their way to get my tires and have them mounted so I could make my trip. Because of that first impression. I am a loyal customer. Recently I needed tires again, their price was better than anyone around. Ive taken my bike for oil changes and brake pads and received quality work and quick turnaround. I highly recommend them."</text>

<user_id>104988387434164273577< /user_id><name>Pasquale C<//name><review>This is applicable to the Service Department.
Same rating and review left on Yelp!

Executive Summary:
If I could give this business a 'zero' rating, I would.  One star is too much.  Don't waste your time and find another Triumph Service location.

Details:
Scheduled the break-in service for my Triumph with this place thinking they would be a good place to establish a Service relationship for the future of my motorcycle ownership; bad move!
The Service Rep Chris (spelling?) was rude, condescending, and disrespectful.   He didn't get up from his chair or bother to look me in the eye while I arrived at the Service area.  Which, by the way is tucked in the back, like you're going into someone's backyard...
Anyway, as he proceeded to ask his questions, he was giving out the feeling that he was bothered by my presence and couldn't wait to get me out of there.  Not sure if he was having a bad day, but it was right after they had opened and it couldn't have been better in terms of outside temperatures (after a scorching Southern California summer).

His demeanor was so rude and condescending that I asked if he had something against me or a problem with me bringing my bike for service.  Obviously, he says no...

I decided to go somewhere else, asked for my keys and left; that was the best decision, other than buying a Triumph, to-date!
LA Cycle Sports took care of me, paid attention to what I was asking, and took the time to explain the service.  They were on my bike right away without an appointment.  Talk to Joey there, he will take care of you and respect your questions/concerns.< /review>< Date>

Had a great experience the first time I came here to buy my son's YFZ50. Despite living in Santa Clarita, I wanted to ensure they had my business when I bought my Raptor 700 a few months later. These guys really care about their customers and go out of their way to make you feel valued. I'll be back when it comes time to upgrade again.< /Text>

Bought my first bike here 6 weeks ago - in short, walked out the door with a Yamaha R3 with 97 miles on it at a crazy rad price and couldn't be happier. I've upgraded with some minor mods, light details and got my license since that glorious day in late July.
Melvin and Kevin were great, and have called every few weeks to check in on the status of the bike. Although I haven't needed anything yet, I know they'll be there when I do. Thanks guys!<//review>

I really wanted to like this company. I am new to town, and they are my local service department. But what an absolute disappointment.
My bike needed minor repairs from a minor accident. A week and a half went by, and I never heard from them. I had to call them. The guy that answered the phone admittedly didn’t know anything about the bike, and gave me a $3000 invoice. That was obviously wrong, and he was listing parts that were never damaged.
I traveled down there, and it was $700.
Another week goes by, they tell me the bike will be ready.
The week I’m supposed to pick it up, they say they discovered another part that requires repair. So they keep the bike.
In all, they had the bike for seven weeks, the price jumps to 1k.
What a disappointing experience, and a disappointing company. This was not a positive experience. They will not receive future business from me, and they have lost future positive word of mouth.
My advice for all of you seeking a repair shop, look elsewhere. Of all the bike shops I’ve worked with, this is the most weak. They should not be carrying the Triumph name.<//text>

He did not get his bike here, thank you, he was mean when he 1st came in, however we treat all customers like Family. Service quoted him a price to make his bike new, (we would never quote undamaged parts), but Brett decided to do the minimum, which we quoted $700. We also told Brett a part was backordered for 3 weeks. When Brett said he called and spoke to someone, it was a salesperson that knew nothing about his bike. Should have called Service. When we finished the bike the Tech test rode it. The Bike was not ridable when it came in and we suggested a brake rotor. Brett authorized it knowing it takes 1 week to have the part here and would be $1000 total. It was done on time, detailed too. So we did everything to help this customer. We have one of the best Triumph Tech's in the Industry who takes pride in his work. Some people can never be happy."}<//response>

<review>So I was just reading some of the low reviews and you can tell these are the guys that just want everything done for free on their timeline. I am in no way connected to Simi cycles however I have been in Simi my whole life. I have done business with them for close to 20 years. I have never purchased anything but I went with a good friend he bought a Yamaha yxz from then and got an excellent price and great service. I have had them do many services for my toys and always pull through. Last year I had a rhino that I just installed long travel on and one axle blew up. I called them and brought it in and repaired it the next day. They even waited a half hour after hours in the rain for me to be able to pick up my part for a trip the next day. The service from these guys is what you expect from a home town family business and nothing less. They didn't have to wait after hours for me but they did. They will continue to get my business and referalls</review><Time>1572821565897<//Time><user>117820287502836238483</user><pictures>None</pictures></record>

I had a great time getting tips from staffs and other riders even with gloomy weather . Food was delicious even if there was no music. Me and a staff went looking for the free tshirt...they were hidden upstairs. I just tested the blue FJR motorcycle...almost the same power as my Hayabusa bUT it made me sit more upright, bike has 2 extra side luggage bags. It has a cruise control,but I didn't apply it since I didn't know it has one. I was there way before your finance manager came in at 8am...I was excited and looking forward for the Demo ride. ”< /Review>

Duane is a great dude. Always easy to work with. Bought many bikes over the years. The guy rides too which is rare these days. Dave in parts is a legend.

Simi Valley Cycles - Duane runs a great shop and has always been helpful with rider support. Small but awesome shop, good prices and parts needed are generally in stock or quick to get. Give them a try as you will not be disappointed. Ask for Duane and tell him to that Nick sent you!

Suzuki, Yamaha and Beta, motocross and street... I’ve been a customer since the late 90’s and still make the 45 minute drive each way.< /Review>

Updated and edited review: Customer service in the service department can be bad. (My story below.) If you want service work done in Simi... you may want to consider one of the other options in town.

I've bought high end gloves and occasional parts here. Very large selection of bikes, great selection of gloves during the summer, smaller selection in the winter. Good selection of other gear.  Some of their sales people seem pretty cool, although I've never actually shopped for a motorcycle here.

My last experience here is the last time I'll go here for service at least, maybe last time ever.  (I MIGHT still check this place out when shopping for bikes, because their selection is seriously impressive.) I took a wheel and tire in to get mounted. A day and a half later, I still hadn't heard from them.  I called to find out what was taking so ridiculously long. Turns out they had just "forgotten" to call me to let me know it was done. I went in to pick it up, and they charged me twice what it should have cost. I commented on the insane price--the person checking me out still didn't realize there was a problem.  I thought I'd just gotten screwed, paid my bill and left, never to return.  After leaving a scathing review here, they called me, apologized claiming it was a mistake, and refunded half of my money. This brought the cost down to a reasonable $25 (approx. w/ tax and disposal fee).  Was it an unforgivable mistake?  No, but why bother going back here when there are so many other shops that have treated me quite well?  This explains why all my friends would say "Eh... they're okay... but I go to _______" about this place. YMMV.< /text>

"I put my Moto Guzzi on consignment and 15 minutes after signing the paperwork, the ad on the SVC website was live. I then made a new motorcycle purchase which was executed flawlessly by the SVC Team. All staff are caring and knowledgeable. I got an amazing price on my new V-Strom and I am one very happy customer. I worked with the parts department on getting new panniers and got a great discount. Financing was easy and explained very clearly to me. I've been riding motorcycles for some 30 years and this is hands down the best buying experience I've ever had. Thanks guys! Great job!!! Neal"</review>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Good motorcycle store. They service all types and brands. Great tire prices but you must ask for the best price. They deal Yamaha , Triumph and some quads don't know the brand. Parts guys are good and knowledgeable, service dept guys are personable. Sales guys are sales guys bahaha made myself laugh they're nice guys too. They have used bikes of all types. And a nice big flat parking lot that's easy to maneuver in. 3/29/19 just had a bad experience, I'm now wondering if its under new management or ownership. I'm not gonna stop going but I'm going to have to really hold them to there word. So we'll see. I'll keep it at four stars for now. (Check that) A couple days later I just need to mention. The bad experience here forced me to another town and bike shop. Now I do business over there and get services as well, better pricing and willingness to work with you. At SVC the service department and parts department are separated.(this is a bad thing). This process has caused some of my problems they really need to get together and standardize the parts department & service department . It would be nice to do business in the town where I live. . .<//review>< pics>

<review>Just got my bike back this morning, they couldn't help at all, plus they lost screws and hose in the shop, and the guy I had to deal with really wasn't nice.. That's the very short story..  Never again

I feel like my reply to your comment wasn't showed here so..

NO

Didn't find my hose, neither my safety staples and some screws..

Say what you want your service was terrible I paid 90$ for nothing and I have to buy stuff for my bike that you lost..

But I let the people be judge..

Thanks again for nothing< /review><user_id>114479998903824156392<//user_id></record>

I was decided on what I wanted before contacting Duane, just needed the bike available and correct price. He contacted me when he said he would, and made a fair deal for me. Never pushy, happy to answer my questions, and appreciated my business. They also helped me out with parts, and ordered what I needed for pick up day.</review>

Great Customer Service from the sales dept., the parts and accessories dept, and even the guy who prepped my new bike. They knew I was not able to get there any earlier due to my job, so all these guys stayed late to get me taken care of. My bike was assembled, prepped, paperwork was ready, and even got all my gear right then and there!!!
Thank you very much...</Text>

Was out in Simi Valley to meet my friend for a ride. I had no side mirrors on my Yamaha R6 (long story) and I needed something to get me by til the ones I ordered came in the mail. Well for $13.00 I got a side mirror, looked ugly but it worked. Looked at the new bikes and wasn't overly bothered by salespeople other than the quick greeting when coming in and a short talk about older bikes. Seems like a decent place with knowledgeable people.  This will be one of my stops next year when looking to buy a new bike.</Text>

Simi Valley Cycles takes the time to care for their customers, even long after the sale is made. Staff, all the way up to the ownership took the time to ensure the customer is 100% satisfied and cared for. Although a misunderstanding, they took the time to make it right, and that speaks volumes in who they are, what they stand for and their position as pillar in Simi Valley community as locally owned and operated business.

Thank you SVC!<//text>

<resp>None< /resp><review>I called on Thursday and Rick gave me a quote. Saturday morning drove 2 hours to get to SVC. Upon arrival met Rick. He showed me the bike which was already prepped for a test ride. 1 hour later after enjoying a nice conversation with the Finance Manager the bike was in the back of my truck heading home. Will definitely buy from SVC again. A+< /review>< rate>

“I was interested on a Red Suzuki GSX S 1000 F. Of 3 dealerships I called only SVC had one. When I got there I met Kevin in sales. I asked him a few questions on the bike he answered them all. The i asked to test ride the bike. Immediately he had a bike ready to test. I loved the bike and we sat down to discus the cost. In less than 10 minutes we had a deal. When I told my buddies at the Rock Store how much i paid their jaws dropped Awesome people, no pressure, congenial and reasonable. Great place, extended inventory great people”<//Review>

Would highly recommend this place. Went in with only a basic idea of what I was looking for, and Paul was incredibly helpful and obviously cared more about finding the right bike for me, and not his paycheck.

I am really glad I went to Simi Cycles to look at the Triumph motorcycles. I visited a place out in the valley and I thought their prices were a little high.

Simi Cycles prices on these were great, and they know alot about there products to.

Good staff.<//text>

We recently purchased a 2018 YZ450 from SVC, what a great experience.  The bike has a new ignition and electronics which we were unfamiliar with. Duane and his team took time to be sure we understood how it worked and we were completely satisfied.  I have bought a lot of motorcycles in my life and SVC has the best sales, service and parts team anywhere.  It is a pleasure just walking into the store. Thanks to you all!</text>

Do not go to SVC for a new bike or used. There sales department look like they hired 2 bums off the street. The 2 bums Steven and Joe from sales were jerks. They told me I wouldn't qualify for fiancing based on there opinions. Again there opinions, Not the lenders. Very unprofessional facility. I left that s$!thole and took my business to TRI-county powersports where i got treated with respect & dignity. Also, I left with a beautiful honda the same day which i got financed thru Honda. Ask for Tyler. He is an awesome dude. And the sales manager Larry was also awesome..... AGAIN AVOID SIMI VALLEY CYCLES!!!!!!< /review>

<pics>None</pics><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Ok, let me start by saying that i am a pain in the **s kind of customer.  I shop and look and test drive and shop and shop, and i am always afraid of paying too much.  i also don't like bike dealers sales staff in general as these guys just do not listen.

Now, let me say how AWESOME my experience was, and i cannot tell you the last time i even took the time to make a review...maybe once 8 years ago?

These guys are quick, painless, professional, honest, and even friendly!  Rick took the lead as i was internet lead, and answered every question i asked and he knew the programs off the top of his head (one dealer i went to didn't even know they had low interest finance or that extras were included in the sale from the manufacturer!)  Every time i sent an email i got one back no matter how little the question was. No one ever told me they would need me to set up a "VIP Appointment" to get the best deal!!!!  lol!!!

Pricing?  They won't get beat, but to be honest, they had great pricing out of the gate, and no need to haggle.   Very fair!  Better than fair probably.

After the sale i wanted to add accessories, and without having to ask i was offered a discount on anything i wanted!   Andy in PARTS was great. Knows his stuff, and told me he would ship my parts to me because i am not local.  Called back in later and spoke to him again and same great service!  OH!  And they have tons of selection!  Anything you need they have it!  I'm lucky my wife was with me or i would have shopped and picked up more great accessories!  Helmets gloves jackets and anything else you can think of.  A little place that's bigger inside than you may think.

Kevin the Finance guy was so quick and really painless.  Even my wife was surprised at how fast he got us through the process.

What can i say?  I wish i lived closer because the Service dept has a great rep as well.  I may even take a trip for service, just because if they do that half as well as the sales end i'll be happy!

Great place to do business.  Highly recommend!<//Review><Time>1530731650500<//Time>< user>

They are amazing with service - even recalls they'll exchange emails and attached documents and let me know when the parts come in.  And if I'm on my 3rd bike with them, they also will work with you as much if not more than the others on the bottom line.  Living in Santa Barbara County, I don't travel as far as Simi just because I like to ride - I have yet to find anyone to touch Simi with professionalism, responsiveness and courtesy.  And this last time I was there, Dewayne gave me the chance to ride a bike I've been lusting over - the Yamaha FZ10, which nobody in Santa Barbara County would do.  Why wouldn't I come back?  I can even visit my friends at the Rock Store on the same trip!  I have some local friends who also feel the same way, willing to make that trip to visit Simi and Dewayne's crew.<//Text><gmapID>0x80e8291e4f851455:0xe00b4bcfdbb69d73<//gmapID>< time>

Thanks for everything and for a really good price too.<//review>< pics>

I took my 2013 Triumph Daytona 675R to the shop for mechanical work. Their mechanic did a great job on the bike, and just about everybody in the back are super cool and easy going. SVC is a great place to bring your speedy two wheels rocket in for mechanical works or basic maintenance. Overall, this is a great motorcycle shop with great people.</Review>

New triumph owner here!! Thanks to Rick in sales. I have always wanted a Bonneville since my dad had one when I was growing up. Now I have one. Just wanted to say this guy is super knowledgeably about Triumphs. I mean I went into a couple other dealers Like Cal coast and To powersports. And i went with SVC because of their down to earth feel, and I think this is how the shop would be back in the 70's. Really laid back, but still very informative. Don't go anywhere else. Plus parts department is quick and very helpfull, and just all around I love this place. Thanks again!!!!< /text>

<Text>Paul was great as the salesman.  He answered all questions and suggested options to suit me.  Kevin was efficient in handling the paperwork, smoothly.  Chris reassurred me that the maintainance on the Rocket would be top notch, and introduced me to the service dept. crew.  Andy was very helpful in the parts dept. helping me order a service manual, cover.  Mike, also in parts, explained the operation of the two way bule tooth communication units.  Dwane gave me a great deal on my old Maxium 1100.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80e8291e4f851455:0xe00b4bcfdbb69d73</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Showroom is acceptable and the salesman are cool (+2 stars). Service department is incompetent. The shop is dirty and disorganized. The few technicians they have are slow and inexperienced. They had my bike for a month and a half when the mechanic finally got around to diagnose the bike that i took there for a malfunctioning taillight. Then he calls me and tells me there is an electrical problem he didn't think he could fix and to come pick up my bike. Ok. I go pick it up and have a bill totaling $612 for parts and labor on spark plugs, air filter, and oil change. And the bike stays locked up until I pay. Ok so i got burned..but then i get the bike home and now it has a gas leak. Go figure (-3 stars).
My advice, go there if you want but spend the time to check out some other shops. I had to drive a little out of my way but found a place that was far more professional. My bike was up and running in 3 weeks and haven't had a problem since.

SVC is by far the worst motorcycle dealer in Ventura County, if not all of Southern California.  Their parts department does not carry a large inventory insuring that their customers will have to wait.  Their service department is staffed by young, untrained technicians who perform shoddy work.

I purchased a motorcycle from them in 2001.  Two years later it developed an intermittent missing problem and I brought it to them under warranty.  They tried on three separate occasions to find and repair the problem and couldn't.  They ended up giving the bike back to me un-repaired.  I then brought the bike to a competing dealer who diagnosed and located the problem in 10 minutes, ordered the part and returned my motorcycle in three days.

While SVC had my motorcycle the last time under warranty, they kept it for 4 weeks, broke my carburetor float bowls, glued them back together with epoxy, replaced defective parts with used ones, stored it outside in the rain (customary for them) and they returned the motorcycle to me completely filthy and corroded.  They refused to repair the damage they had caused or even detail the bike.

I highly recommend that you avoid Simi Valley Cycles.</Text>

I had a serious financial loss with a pay cut at work. A couple years back and started saving money. I started looking into motorcycles for better gas mileage. I saw that the Drz 400 got around 65 MPG!!!! So I shopped around alot and found that Simi Cycles had really good prices. And being the closest to me. I went in and wound up getting the DRZ. Now i am saving money on my gas... ALOT. But the major kicker is that I got qualified to not pay any interest for five years on my loan. I am so glad that I went in and bought this bike. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend this shop to other riders. Hope to see any of you out there. Or maybe at the parts counter!<//review>

One size fits all and it's a couple dollars more than it should be per pizza, but it's a great spot to sit outside in the summer or pick it up and take it home in the winter!</Text>< pics>

<Text>2 hour wait to cook pizza? This only means they were understaffed and unprepared for business tonight.  Very disappointed.

Visited again Jan 1, still same rating.  We did the Take and Bake option. Cooked fine but this is not a $20+ pizza.  By the way... pizza does not come with cooking instructions.  Make sure you ask before you leave the restaurant and make sure they actually know the correct information.< /Text><rating>1</rating>< user_name>

< review>
First time there, the pizza tasted like it had been frozen. Burrito was half filled with unseasoned white minute rice. Seems to have been a change because this place was recommended to us and the food was mediocre at best. Very few choices for pizza toppings and we overheard others complaining behind us. Manager listened but did not make any amends. Very disappointing. The one star is for the play items they had available for kids and the beer.<//review>

Maybe it goes without saying, but this place is closed in the winter! We went on a long walk with this as our destination last week and were sad to not be rewarded with a much anticipated beer... so hoping to prevent others from the same disappointment.< /Text>

<rating>3< /rating><text>This used to be one of my favorite pizza places, but they recently changed their crust. It's advertised as "sourdough", but it is dry, tasteless, and has a cardboard-like texture. Toppings are a delicious as ever, but on that new crust, it is an unpleasant pizza.< /text><name>Francesca Pepoon<//name></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>It was obviously busy during holiday season. They mentioned that one of their pizza ovens is broken, so it would take longer than an hour. So we ordered other things, chicken and fries for the kids, salad and two paninis, and salmon. Unfortunately it still took almost an hour to get our food, long time with hungry kids.
While we were waiting, another waiter wanted to bring us food, which wasn't ours. And he did this 3 !!! Times.
When food finally arrived, there was no silverware. After asking, we got only forks (one dish was salmon pasta). Anyway another round and we had plenty of silverware.
Food was barely ok. Fries super salty (not what you want for kids) and panini was more like a fried sandwich.
If it's off season, this place might be nice. They have a kids play room and a playground outside.</text></record>

Food is ok but overpriced even by Truckee standards. Have been there many times and pizza is inconsistant. Servers are friendly and quick - there's usually only one person waiting/bartending and another cooking.

Don't bother to go for their Trivia Night promo. It's rigged as a group of employees wins 9 times out of 10. We've even heard them discussing the answers an hour before the game starts. And Tahoe Donner management is on record as supporting them.

If you want better pizza and fair trivia, try Best Pies Pizza a few miles away.< /review>

<resp>{'time': 1578698071123, 'text': 'Hello Theo,  Our "Night on the Town" class is temporarily cancelled at the request of the instructor.  You can view other classes and activities on our website here:  https://www.hesperiaparks.com/classes.\nOur main administrative offices are located at Lime Street Park, 16292 Lime Street.  The Rick Novack Community Center is a satellite facility.  We hope you give it another try and find something you\'re interested in!'}< /resp><review>Excellent facility, but for some reason nothing ever happens here.  I wanted to take the ballroom dance class but for some reason it was cancelled.  There's never anyone around administering the facility.  Seems like a ghost town right here in West Hesperia. Bye, bye, Theo.

Interestingly,  I did check, in person,  with the main office on Lime street quite some time ago.  I asked, if they would be interested in having a ballroom dance class offered at their main facility.  Plus, I already had students lined up to take the class.  The lady I chatted with said; "submit a proposal,"  within two days I did.  The next day I got a response.  A lady called and said "NO."  Odd, how these public centers supported by some of my tax dollars are so anti-public, or so it seems.  The Novak center remains "ghostly."< /review>< user_name>

I go here quite often, while the playground for this area is pretty small, it has a great open field to play sports in. No available drinking fountain however so bring a few drinks if you plan on going. A few benches to sit down at also.</review>

I tripped when I was walking .thank goodness that I didn't  get hurt.. please make sure that the lights are on during the night. On Sunday when the kids are playing basketball. Thank you very much for your matter on this. Please take this matter seriously as you can fall or someone can attack you in this dark area.< /Review>< pictures>

Really good experience. The staff member Charlie is really nice. He helped out with setting up. Only thing is there was no refrigerator, we brought a lot of food for my son's 5th birthday. Other than that, was nice.< /review>

It's also an amazing place to have a picnic, but there's many more things you can do there. Let's say you want to take a walk, there is a concrete or dirt passage where you can walk.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Outstanding service and delicious food! We ordered the gourmet five meat pizza, Chicken bacon ranch and pineapple/bacon pizzas.  I also ordered the superfood salad with kale and Brussel sprouts.  I loved the salad and especially the dressing on it.  We ended with two pzookies-salted Carmel and chocolate chip.  My boys loved the sports on the TVs too.  Our server Alex was super attentive and stayed on top of drink refills.  Love this restaurant and highly recommend!</text>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><response>None< /response><pics>None</pics><Review>I had a good experience with BJ’s and their customer service. I had ordered a lot of food including spaghetti and meatballs, but unfortunately, the spaghetti was not included in the bag when I picked up the order. I called to let them know before we ate anything and they transferred me to Aaron, the manager, who offered to have it remade and he would throw in a free dessert. We ate our food that was included and called back to have the spaghetti reheated before we went back. They gave us the missing spaghetti as well as the dessert and it was all delicious! Very kind customer service with an awesome manager who is willing to fix any issues. Couldn’t have asked for a better resolution.<//Review>< Name>

<Review>Just got home after a date night here.  My husband and I ate delicious hamburgers,  I had the Bistro Burger.  It had a great taste.  It was huge and came with fries.  Next time, we might sit the meal, very filling.  Then, we could get dessert! Our waiter was friendly and fast, great service!! We will definitely return.  Glad to be able to dine inside, so nice!!

The food was mostly good but was appalled by two things.
1) The wedge salad that was supposed to have blue cheese crumbles and bacon had a single crumble and miniscule bacon.
2) Apparently "medium" as an option for a burger implies pink and dripping blood. I expected it to go moo.</Review>

Bad service. Waiter spilled my son's alcoholic beverage into his water & on the table. Never brought napkins or offered a new water. He took so long to come back to check on us that we had to ask the plate server for napkins. The server brought one paper towel & wiped off the table, but didn't bring or leave any extras, even tho' my son ordered a rack of BBQ ribs.

Had to ask for the check which happens sometimes. It was not overly busy, though. He couldn't/wouldn't wait for the payment card, said he'd be right back. He did like 5 other things before coming back.

We didn't make a list, so the above are the only issues that i can remember, now, several days later.

We don't like hovery wait staff, but it was kinda' hard to get a hold of this guy.

Both my husband & my son enjoyed the food & the drinks. (I didn't order/eat anything).</review>

Definitely hands-down one of the most spectacular eats in the Los Angeles area. There are many who try to imitate but don't even come close to this place. I might be biased because I've been here since I was a mere Youngin but if I were To recommend Persian Food to anyone it is between this please and another in Glendale that I choose not to name here. Best quality and most authentic Persian cuisine, don't skip this place, go hungry and bring friends.</review>

< Review>
100% a very poor and disapointing experience. I will not be eating at BJs again.

After our initial mothersday plans fell through we thought we could still have a decent dinner by having BJ's delivered so I ordered online from the BJs website.

At the time that the food was supposed to have already been delivered the delivery driver texted me to let me know he was at the BJs but our food wasn't ready (see attached photo).

The food eventually showed up 30 minutes late but the main course (the pizza we ordered) wasn't there so we were left with salad and desert for dinner.

When I called to figure out what the problem was I was put on hold for 10 minutes waiting for a manager. He was initially somewhat apologetic but quickly tried ot shift the blame to the delivery driver. He did offer to give me a gift card for the same value of my pizza but when I insisted on getting the amount refunded to my card instead (because I have no plans of going back to BJs) he acknowledged my request and then hung up on me before I could get confirmation or ask for the delivery fee and tip to be refunded (basically another $20 wasted on this dinner that we never recieved).

I understand that things slip through the cracks and people make mistakes, but the way this was handled after the fact was the worst. Order online at your own risk.</Review>

Our waitress was great.  The four of us  are all in our 80's.  We had not been there since October 2021.  Our waitress remembered that 2 of us always had salmon and avocado egg roll appetizers.  Our waitress was Jill G. #242 LOCATION #438.<//Review>

Eating outdoors was lovely. Conversation was possible without feeling like you had to shout. My ears weren't assaulted by the echoes of constant noise. Inside there is nothing to absorb the clatter sounds. I don't like to eat inside of a BJ's for that reason. If they continue to offer outdoor seating I will return. The food was delicious. The server was attentive and pleasant.< /text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>It was my first time ordering the bossam (korean dish that consists of lightly spiced boiled pork belly with veggies and spicy root side dish to wrap it in) and the mandu (dumplings) but they tasted authentic and well seasoned. I liked how nothing in this meal was too bland or too salty, especially since Korean food at restaurants tend to be too salty. I am excited to go again once the shelter in place is over. Its a great simple place to have a hearty meal with friends, family, coworkers, and for dates! Totally recommend to all! Especially those who are not familiar with knife noodles and want to try different dishes in Korean cuisine.< /Review><Rate>4<//Rate>< time>

The food was mostly good but was appalled by two things.
1) The wedge salad that was supposed to have blue cheese crumbles and bacon had a single crumble and miniscule bacon.
2) Apparently "medium" as an option for a burger implies pink and dripping blood. I expected it to go moo.<//text>

I have had meals at this BJs location many times and have been very satisfied. Friendly staff and some great happy hour specials. That all changed today.  The staff is still the best and very friendly- I ordered a veggie large pizza for take out this afternoon.  When I got it home opened the box and stuffed the first slice in my mouth I almost choked on this incredibly over salted pizza.  I was thinking that a veggie would be less salty by nature- not so at BJs. I had to throw the rest away cuz I am on a low salt diet- but this was over the top and the dominant flavor was salt !!   Not enjoyable and will never order again.< /Text>

My lfriend and I went there for her birthday dinner. She got the black and white pasta and I got the gnocchi. We both loved the gnocchi better.
The service was great and desserts was even better!</text>

I'd like to update my review. After a bad experience with delivery but still complimenting the food and saying I'd be back, the owner reached out to ensure I'd be a happy customer and invited me back for a meal on them. I criticized the fries as being terrible cold but MY GOD those bad boys hot are something else. I love that they give extra sauce without even asking ad the "slider" is essentially a chicken sandwich. $14 for two sliders and a side can fill up two people. It's actually affordable and tasty.

I thought the pick up line was a bit confusing/scattered but the food was absolutely phenomenal.</Review>

This place is so good. They don't take reservation but you can be added to the waitlist aka get added when you're getting ready so by the time you arrive you're next in line. The service is great too .<//Text>

Have enjoyed a number of meals here.

Wait staff seem to change shift mid service which is odd.

Have been told 25 minute wait only to wait over an hour.

No complaints over food quality!<//Text>< Response>

<review>Beer, Schnitzel, and Apple strudel oh my! What more can you ask for on a stay at home Friday night date night! I was so excited to get take out from this local Biergarten in Los Angeles! Since I moved here I've been going to this little gem for all of those tasty German eats, so it was a no brainer I'd jump on the bandwagon and order take out from here.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Worst experience I have had in lack of Service on any Veteran’s Day meal at any restaurant.
Ordered rib eye steak ! Wanted it medium and it came out raw  .
Asked for water and pepper and had to ask for it again 3 times before it arrived
Asked for coffee and waited 20 minutes for it . Then asked for sweetener and by the time it came out the coffee was cold
Got the check and they charged for the first steak that I returned as well as the replacement steak .
Had 4 different waiters serving our table and none communicated with the others! Never saw our original waiter again after he took our  original order .
Had to send the bill back twice to get the final correct billing .
By the way the restaurant was not at all busy during this service fiasco
Would not recommend this BJs for anyone, especially our Service members on Veterans Day

Worse experience ever. We were given very dirty glass of water with lipstick all over on it. Once we complained, very rude and unexperienced manager responded that he will not serve us and asked us to leave. He even said he called the cops. I do not recommend this place at all. it was a true nightmare.<//review>

I haven't been to Bj's in quite sometime and it was great food was delicious. I got the chicken Alfredo and it was AMAZING !! Anyways our waitress, B was GREAT, she talked to me as if I was her own as she was taking our order.  She's on it like white on rice lol , even though she had multiple tables she had time to stop by ours just to check in. Anyways job well done, she's amazing. Thank you B .</review>

<GmapID>0x80dce8f282463167:0x6ac692d5f49785e3< /GmapID><Text>A chain restaurant not unlike your typical Chilli’s or TGI Friday’s. Pretty standard, middle of the road food though although I guess you’re not supposed to expect much.

Fried cheese curds were very salty, clam chowder was like prison gloop (very thick and only just edible), Santa Fe salad was very wet. I think you’ll have much more luck with their regular fare – things like their Loaded Burgers and Enlightened entrees, the latter of which is billed as a more healthier alternative to pretty much everything else on the menu. The one saving grace was their flatbreads which were basically like thin crust pizzas and therefore delicious.

I will give them credit for the Pizookie though, although having soft-baked cookie topped with ice cream screams “diabetes bomb”. It was still good though, and something that can be enjoyed on occasion.<//Text>< username>

The prime rib is my favorite. They have a special that comes with a soup/salad, 2 sides, prime rib, and a pazookie for dinner. Great value and lots of food.< /review>

Been wanting to try this ramen place for a while. I finally did with my sister ... we got a few dishes to share. We tried the Brussel Sprouts which were really good. The Salmon Roll was so fancy with the lotus chips on top. I wish I took a picture but I was so hungry I didn't get a chance to =p . My sister and I also shared the Vegetable Miso Ramen which was big enough to share between two people. We sat outside in the balcony and the weather was nice .<//Review>

I came here to eat and 20 minutes ago I got a drink but no one approached me after that to order food.  I saw other people walk in after me and their orders were taken.  What's wrong with that picture. I came in at 5.20 got s drink immediately  - I don't think they have their reopen act together<//text>

The third time we called at curbside they said they would get our order out to us and never came outside. We had to go in and get the order. We only orderd pazookies and they forgot the ice cream. The worst part was we ordered over a hour ahead.

<Text>I absolutely LOVE the deep-dish pizza here. And if you haven't tried their pizookie ( cookie pizza with ice cream) then you are missing out! A great place to go with family and friends to have a good time. Service is pretty good considering how crowded they are. And although there are huge amounts of people, I've never had to wait too long to be seated.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I’ve been coming here for a long time. It always seems like a classic. Especially for the pazookie🍪. Mmmmmm. Food tastes great, nice atmosphere. Although the claim chowder soup in the bread bowl🍞 could use way more soup and way less bread. So that’s sad. But other than that, still tasted all wonderful!</Review>

<Text>We came here 2 times during a conference and were VERY happy with the service each time. The staff were always friendly and attentive - I always had my water filled regularly and didn't feel like I was waiting forever for waitstaff. Overall the wait for 2 people wasn't bad either night (for weekend nights). When you get out of a LONG conference day and have another one ahead of you, the last thing you want is to wait too long.

The consistency with the food was also excellent each time. Depending on where you are in the hospital, it is walkable from Memorialcare Saddleback Medical Center as well as the Laguna Hills Lodge.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Avocado Egg Rolls, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Pizookie - especially the Cookies 'n Creme one - or opt for the trio of pizookies< /Text>< pics>

Great service and food! Love getting the lunch special where u pick 2 things.  I always get the personal pizza with a wedge salad. I have had many wedge salads and bj's is the BEST!! Tip: ask for a side of marinara for the pizza and best to ask for salad dressing on the side cause when there's too much it's not good.</review>

<text>Two longtime acquaintances of mine do not have cars and were waiting for a ride. Management asked them not to stand outside the door when they weren’t even blocking other customers’ entry or exit. Management and waitstaff refuse to see past the conclusion they have jumped to that anyone who waits for a ride and is not the cleanest, best-looking is a “crazy old hag from the hospital”. UNTRUE!

I will not be a customer here until those who get here without cars are respected while waiting for rides. I have encouraged the abovementioned acquaintances to take their business elsewhere. I further encourage anyone who doesn’t get here in a car they will be parking here and taking when they leave to take their business elsewhere since the rude managers and waitstaff will shoo them away too.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I’m so surprised to see good reviews for this place. I was there yesterday and it was such a disappointing experience. Everything was dirty. The service was beyond slow! I cut a lot of slack but it wasn’t even busy. We had to ask multiple times for the same things and finally just gave up. (We weren’t being extra either. It was a side of ranch, straws, napkins) One pizza was super salty. The other was chewy, had no flavor. The appetizers didn’t come till our food did. (We waited an hour for food) the drink orders were wrong. And never refilled. I had a rewards code for a free pazookie,  I didn’t even bother ordering it! The food was gross, service was slow. I didn’t want to wait another 40 minutes for it. So we didn’t bother.</review>

I've gone here for dinner a couple of times now and will love to go back. I've had their spaghetti and their chicken alfredo and they are delicious. My friend ordered their pork chop and WOW! Great portion sizes, enough for two meals. Servers can vary. Last time I was here their electricity went off only in the building. Honestly, it was a cool experience!</text>

Not what it used to be. We waited 1 hour and 20 min before we saw our food. I used to live nearby and stopped by recently while visiting family. The service was AWFUL. Haven’t had it this bad anywhere. Frequently had to get up and go get our own drinks and forgotten food from other people because our waitress was nowhere to be found. Pizza wasn’t anywhere near as good as it used to be. It was just all bread and our fives cheese pizza had less cheese on it than the five meat pizza did and it was all very dry. The waitress insisted on waiting to get our pizookie order after we suggested we get it in early so by the time I finally tracked her down, again, after we were done eating for 10 min, she said it would be another 20 min until we would get our pizookies, the whole reason I came there for my birthday. NEVER doing this Again. So many disappointments and we did this all with young kids 🙄👈🤯<//review>

< Review>
Generally Friday nights are really busy. This I know. I had a to go order and it was taking a really long time, even for being a Friday night. I was very patient. When my order finally did arrive, I noticed that it did not follow the instructions that was very clearly written on the order. This was somewhat upsetting. So, I had to wait longer for them to remake it. I thought the manager might do something nice to make up for it but he didn't. Just said he was sorry. No one even offered me a drink while I was waiting. Bummer.<//Review>

<name>Angelo Zanki<//name><Review>Chicken leg bis😳

But in all honesty, bjs is kinda fire🌝 HOWEVER, I just recently bought four pizookies for takeout, and they had basically forgotten three of them, and I had just realized this once I arrived back at my house. The manager gifted me a “courtesy card”, which is basically a cheap gift card. Anyways, my order had summed up to about $24, and after finding out the balance on the card, I was truly disappointed. I live 15 minutes away from this bjs and their $10 courtesy card had, if even, made up for all the gas I had wasted during my multiple voyages to this fine place of dining. Might as well give me a Costco card to get gas, like tf.<//Review>< Resp>

The first time I went at lunch on a weekday with a larger group, the server was nice and service was pretty quick considering our larger group. I also went for happy hour once. The bar was full and they let my party sit in a booth and still get the happy hour prices, which was really cool of them. They didn't have to do that. I think it was a Tuesday and ALL OF THE WINE WAS HALF OFF. not even kidding, it was the best happy hour deal that I've ever come across.</Text>

Went there yesterday for my grandsons birthday and will not go back. This was the one in the Laguna Hills mall. There were seven of us. The service was fine, it was the food. I had a Philly steak sandwich and was just meat and roll. The meat was so full of fat I threw more than half away. The meat did not look that good. When I got home my stomach starting acting up and I felt  bad. Spent half the night ln the bathroom.< /Review>

Or party of five included the visitors from Japan.  The shared two fights of four different beers -- eight different in total. There was a lot of discussion in Japanese and all of the beer was consumed along with another glass of the consensus favorite. The food was consistently flavorful, served at appropriate temperatures.  If I could have one suggestion fulfilled, it would be for smaller portions at smaller prices.  If love to be able to leave BJ's without a doggie bag.</Text>

Waste of money. We got the 16 dollar Santa Fe salad which was ok. The Mediterranean tacos tasted rotten. 13 dollars. Cheese only pizza removed tomatoes and it was 20 for xlarge. Cheese tasted frozen. Even with the 10 dollar coupon this place wasn't worth it.<//review>

The food I've tried is pretty good. The atmosphere is nice throughout the restaurant and in the bar for watching a game. The service is very good in both areas as well. The menu just seems full of lackluster overpriced items for the most part. Thus I'm always stuck on the same few items which again are fine.<//review>

<Text>Ok food. Never come with more than 4 people as the servers will take orders 2 people at a time. But when it comes to the bill they won't know how to split the checks so order another drink because you will be waiting. Also the servers happily talk about you in front of their table.< /Text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

First, the staff seems extremely friendly. Bar staff especially. However, there is a huge lack of training in regards to the wait staff. I watched the wait staff walk over pieces of trash on the floor countless times as well as leaving dirty dishes stacked on a table for well over an hour. It looked trashy. The management must take early Saturday afternoons off. When I saw a manager make his rounds, he asked a waitress to clean the 2 high tops that were stacked with dirty dishes and she waived him off with a “that’s not my job” attitude. Unbelievable disrespect. She proceeded to check the set ups in a drawer instead of bus the tables. If the front of the restaurant is a sty, does that mean the kitchen where our food is prepared is just as messy with a lack of pride in the food that’s prepared? This place needs to be shopped hard.< /Text>

<Text>Great lively atmosphere with great food and beer. The staff were all very nice and helpful. The food was great and they even made us an item that is no longer on the menu. The beer is tasty, I recommend the Grand Cru or Red. And mad props to the waiter who made sure the group who had been drinking a little too much weren't driving home.</Text>< Name>

Ok. A bit crowded this holiday weekend.   The new system of one person taking orders and the random runners bring you drinks and food makes you feel like you're in an assembly line. Not a restaurant.<//Review>

Unfortunately the worst experience at any BJ's.  We love BJ's food but this time the entire experience was awful.  Slow, bad service,  cold pizza, no toppings on half the pizza,  cold cookies for dessert,  wrong drinks constantly,  several different servers even the manager who had bad cigarette breath and left after glass fell over and he didn't clean it up or get me a napkin for water falling on me. Visiting California but won't go back there. Too many other good places with good food and service.  Sad.<//review>

<Text>Love the 3$ pizookie tuesdays and half off wine. It was very crowded so service was slow, but the waitress was so nice.
Even though it was busy the noise level was very appropriate.
I also love there late night happy hour. Its so nice to be able to get some discounted food and drinks after a long days work. The service is always nice too!</Text>< user_name>

Free parking lot
Not too crowded or loud
Friendly staff
Despite great menu variety, sub par food and drink*
I would like to mention however, that we arrived about 45 (maybe up to 35) minutes prior to closing time and therefore intended to order our food Togo and were prepared to wait however long (no rush and our apologies to the staff ('cause we've been there, done that, and are now "one of those" on this particular night)); so after placing our order, we waited at the bar.

Anytime I've been to any other BJ's, they've had a "Strawberry Fields" martini (or something to that affect) on the menu and its the tops. Upon seeing this menu was sans my "go to" drink option, I inquired at the bartender who assured me that he knew of the drink and that it would be no problem to make it...
Worst drink ever (@ BJ's anyway). Passed it off (somehow) to my friend who just figured she'd down it mixed with her delicious tropical drink which, hey, thats her call (destroyed her drink but totally her fault). Anyway, we get our order and peace out just before (if not at) closing time.

We get home to find our food a mixed variety of either burnt or mushy...

No, we didn't call because: a. they were closed anyway b. we were just taking care of a personal matter that day/night with plans to head back home that next morning and c. mainly, we didn't want to deal with the stress that usually comes with "complaining" etc. etc.

*So this review is related to this particular BJ's on that particular night with those being the specifics potentially being the change and hopefully not the constant. But I'll let you be the judge. I will say, always, no matter what/where, I feel the majority of their menu is over priced; yet I still somehow end up returning at some point in life anyway. That's all :p<//Text>

Similar to Cheesecake factory
This place has a nice variety of food to choose from.

I tend to gravitate toward salads and salmon dishes.

Both of theirs are good. Ohh and so are some of their desserts !<//Text>

<Text>I am sitting here and food arrived 8 min ago.  Shrimp way overdone, someone very high-handed with the spice for the shrimp, quinoa not done enough, no other flavor, seems like jarred mushrooms instead of fresh, asked for a plate and chives for the potato.  He brought plate, no chives.  He came back to see how doing and noticed we had no chives.  He looked at potato and said, "oh, the chives.  Be right back." He then brought chives, but didn't see if we wanted anything else.  I gave it a 2.5 rating, because the waiter was pleasant and when he came to see if i wanted boxes, i explained my displeasure, and he took my meal off the bill.  Why does it seem that the wait staff, to our table, put everything at an angle and to the side, but they don't come straight at the table? Weird.</Text>< Response>

I ate from this restaurant once , I can’t really complain about food quality, the place is nice and quiet, good for families and adults, the only problem is the wait time, they really don’t care a lot about to go orders ( take away) section is very poor, probably management issue< /review>

they at first took a while to make the food, after a while of waiting (30 minutes) the waiter made it up to us by getting us on the house desserts. although it took a while for the food, the food was still good and we still got free desserts. i feel as if they made up for the time they took.<//Text>

We love BJ’s deep dish pizza 🍕and Pizookies. One of the best deep dish pizza places in OC.  Also be sure to check out their deals going on throughout the week to get better pricing on your visits.

Their app is good minus not showing correct prices sometimes.  There loyalty program is not bad either, but not as good as before the change.

Be ware of call ahead ordering.  Last few times I called for takeout was beyond bad.  One time was put on hold for 5 minutes, hung up, called back to be put on hold for 10+ minutes.  Ended up hanging up as I was at the restaurant.  We very much enjoy this deep dish, or I would have not gone back again.</text>

Well, I have been to a couple BJs restaurants.So knowing this Im not going off of a one time deal. The atmosphere is great! Good vibes and all. The staff again fantastic. Its unfortunate that both times and different locations. The food well, just not very good. Its not just me. People in my party were very dissatisfied. Sorry BJs what can I say. Food being sent back not once but twice by two different people. I have to say. . yes you stepped up fixed it but it wasnt a good experience. The food is a bit pricey. We had a med sized party with about 15 ppl and two birthdays at our table. It was a Friday nite, so I give you that. All in all though, I wouldnt pick this restaurant again. The sad part is the pazookis. Thats a dessert with your choice of a fresh baked cookie and served with icecream and whip cream, is the BOMB! HMM, I GUESS I WOULD GO FOR DESSERT!< /review>

2.5 stars seems there is a poor morale problem with the wait staff.  Some of the new staff try hard but need training so that complete orders come out at the time
a couple can start eating together. The practice of food being delivered by someone other than your table waiter causes issues . There is not a lot of attention to coffee or other non alcoholic refills. Bottom line : it doesn't seem as if the employees really care whether you eat at BJ's or not.

Quality of the product is not the issue. Mechanism and logistics of the front line servers is.</Text>

Very little chicken in the peanut chicken noodles.. It tasted  good but the amount of meat was  ridiculous, it was dry as well.. I should have let the waitress know, there's no meat in here.. It was  $16.00... THATS ALOT OF MONEY FOR NOODLES AND WATER...< /review>

<text>Great food most of the time. I have pizza, spaghetti and meatballs,  bread bowl soups, and salads the most when visiting BJ's. Though the food is usually quite tasty, there are times when the kitchen staff seem to be off their game. Servers range quite a bit here. I have had fantastic friendly knowledgeable servers, okay servers, and really bad servers. If you are looking for a quiet lunch or supper, you will need to come at 'off' hours...a late lunch or early supper.</text>< Resp>

Busy place, extensive menu so there's something for everyone! Friendly staff, large bar area. I had the ahi tuna salad and it was okay, not a ton of flavor but okay. Maybe it was an off night. The others at my table were happy with their choices. The dessert was very good, a pizookie!< /Text>

<review>In my life, I have never experienced this level of awful service from any restaurant. The manager, Michelle and her staff were very unprofessional and extremely cruel with us. We asked about a discount that unknown to us, was expiring, and Michele looked at us like we had committed a crime for asking about it. She said to our family, "You should've known better than that" and continued to belittle and scold us for inquiring about it. Normally it takes a lot for me to feel offended by anything, as I am a pretty friendly and reasonably understanding person, but I have to admit, it was some of the worst treatment my family and I had ever received from another human being in general. We had given them our business and then treated like dirt in return. Honestly, it wasn't going to bother me either way whether we were able to receive the discount or not. I would have been just as happy to receive a normal response as simple as, unfortunately we are not able to honor that discount. It's a shame that they feel like they no longer need to be friendly to their customers anymore and at the minimum, treat them with simple human decency. No appreciation for what they have. It's very unfortunate, I hope people start to go someplace else, and that Michele and her staff are humbled some day by their terrible actions to all the good people that have gone there.< /review><username>Bailey Bryan< /username><user_id>108785565482373114904< /user_id>< response>

I know this is a chain, and bound by the franchise for much of what they offer, but I've been to many BJ's locations and this one beats them all in friendliness of wait staff, cleanliness, attention to details, and I even think the food tastes better than others. I hosted a wedding rehearsal party here and it couldn't have been nicer. Karen was our server and she was polite, friendly, and still professional. Drinks were not as well made as I would have liked.< /review>

Food was very good and service was great. They brought out garlic knots and fruit cups for my kids before even taking our order. Kept the kids calm and happy.</review>

<Review>Called this location on a Monday evening at 6 p.m. and was put on hold three separate times and my call was never picked up. To add to the frustration the phone rang at least 6 times before Alex picked up and put me back on hold. Poor customer service and it's too bad because I really enjoy going to this location for special events.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

All the servers and staff are excellent.  Food was excellent.  My problem was with the bar.  We ordered a drink that they didn't have the correct ingredients. Instead of giving us the choice of picking a different drink they winged it creating a hideous concoction.<//Text>

BJ’s was great when it was Pizza and Brew. The menu is now the size of War and Peace. Maybe some people appreciate the hat but I miss the feel it used to have. That said, the pizza is still good<//Text>

Favorite place to eat with friends when staying at the Ayres Hotel Laguna Woods for work. Lots of variety for vegetarians. And lots of space. Can get a little noisy at times though.</Review>

The food is fantastic every time, service is slow though and tend to mix up your order a lot. But the food is worth it. Their pizzookies are SO good and their steak/fish/chicken is great as well.<//text>

Great service. Food is ok but drinks are great. Our waitress was on top of her game. Really made the family feel good coming here on a crowded football evening. Can''t go wrong with anything on the menu for portions. Their craft beer is what caught my eye.<//Text>

This place is always good to go and watch a ballgame have a few drinks with some buddies and get some great bar food. I always manage to find someone on the other who wants to bet on the game and pretty much pay for my meal so I always get lucky at BJ's. The deserts see a must.< /review>

I was very disappointed from my visit at this BJ's. It was all around a disaster from the service to the (1st) food served. I ordered the BJs classic chicken sandwich with mash potatoes. When I took the top bun off the sandwich the bun was twice the size of the meat (Literally). I was surprised they would even serve this to anyone, it was basically a bread sandwich. I immediately told the server, (who looked embarrassed). I ordered a hamburger and fries. The hamburger was good,  But the service was horrible. The server never came back to the table to check on us. I had to flag down a different waiter for another iced tea. The other people in my party never received a refill or checked on about their food or drinks.</Text>

<text>The only upscale dining and drinking in Menifee right now. Good atmosphere. A couple of the bartenders have no personality. Not too attentive to a new customer coming to sit at the bar. It's their world not yours, is the feeling you get from them. Shame really. Spoils a good experience otherwise.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dce8f282463167:0x6ac692d5f49785e3<//Gmap_id><user_id>113978517224396507062< /user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<review>We went for my eldest daughters birthday after school for pazookies (sp?). They had deal on that day of the week so we brought a couple of her friends as a mini party. Asked the server specifically about the deal and then ordered a bunch of them for all the kids and the wife and i. Check came without the deal and no server to be found. Had to wait for this to be corrected 7 kids hopped up on sugar and waiting not so patiently to go to our next stop of big air.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I am addicted to the french dip here, along with the Jeremiah Red Ale. Staff is always friendly here and I never have a issue with any of my orders. One of the best Bj's I have been to. Easy parking up front for take out orders is a plus too. Also their new happy hour deals with the mini pizzas is a great deal.< /Review>

<text>It's ok, I do not recommend if your taking a lunch expect to be here a couple hrs. Friendly staff...never seems super busy but still take a bit of time depending on what you ordered. I did like the lunch special of unlimited soup and salad and it does not have to be the same one. As long its listed on the lunch special.</text>< pics>

BJ's is the daddy-daughter lunch place of choice in my family and the experience is always great. What's not to love about a place with great food, excellent kids' menu, very good beer and enough noise that no one hears a loud baby?</Review>

<Text>Unimpressed to say the least. It has been awhile since I have been here and it will be awhile before I return  (if ever) given the experience tonight. We were celebrating mom's birthday as a family.  Her fries arrived cold, my wife's pizza was burnt on the bottom and the cheese wasn't even melted. Aren't they know for pizza? My brothers spaghetti was supposed to be spicy but was actually bland and lacking any flavor. Lastly never once offered refills on drinks.

I spoke with the manager who was very nice and apologetic which was appreciated. He offered to adjust the bill but I told him it was not my intent.  Even then the server should have comped the burnt pizza that we had to send back.  My wife ended up having to take  the pizza to go as she had to feed our newborn and it already been 2 hours and we were on 2nd attempt at a pizza

So in closing dinner took two hours, my wife had to take her meal to go, I paid full price for a mediocre meal, and it did not make for a memorable birthday dinner for my mom.</Text>< resp>

Holiday party on the covered patio was well done.  Pizza is Chicago style and much better than I remembered. Over 50 beers on tap and a super chocolatey brownie a la mode in a pizza pan for dessert.< /text>

It's a very typical BJ restaurant. They have decent food and the location is fine. It is closer to an older demographic, so it's not the trendiest. I do enjoy their in house beer, especially the red and Porter. Great for lunch in my opinion.</text>

This place is always busy.  The service is good and I've never had anything but excellent food here. For this reason parking is a bear!  If I were to make any suggestions at all it would be to add seating outside for waiting customers .< /Review>

< Review>
The staff rocked! I went on a Friday night with my girlfriend and I hate going out on Fridays because restaurants are always super busy and theres always a lot of waiting for the wrong food. NOT HERE! Our waiters nailed it, there were 3 waiters that took care of us and they checked up on us and made sure everything was perfect (and it was). I was so impressed that I had to call over the manager and let her know how great of a job they did that night. It couldnt have been better!</Review>

Wasn't to pleased. Yesterday my friends and I came here for a late lunch. The waiter Isaac was extremely rude. He took forever for our appetizers to come out. It took him over 20 minutes to get us our checks. As for the appetizers, I understand If the chef is backed up but a little follow up with your table goes a long way. This is a great restaurant that I've come to for years and I still plan on coming. Management please look into this, this Is honestly the first and only complaint Ive ever made on you guys. Perception Is everything for a guest whether Its their first time eating here or regular customer. Thanks.< /Text>

Me and my beloved friend ordered the shrimp scampi and we were very excited, after though our stomachs were upset and did not enjoy the over powering buttery taste. I felt unpleasant after. I do not recommend it, although the shrimp is cooked extremely well the butter is a pool and my insides were twisting and turning. Not a very good galentines day later that night. Also I know separate checks suck , and yes we know what Venmo is but it would be nicer to have a more positive upbeat personality from some waiters and waitresses.
Thank u, next
See u Tuesday!</text>< rate>

Great food and service, but the bathroom was gross and had no paper in any of the stalls, thus the reason for the lower rating. Sorry, but this is something that should be kept up, especially in a busy location and on a Saturday night.< /Review>

I personally find the food a bit bland, but it's a good spot to go with a group of less adventurous diners. Beer selection is great and the staff is wonderful.< /Review>

The restaurant has plenty of  choices for food but I would check their daily special because the ribs are plenty for two people on Thursdays and I'm sure the other days are plentiful so don't over order. There are also specials on their drinks at your table and at the bar until 7 p.m..<//review>

<review>Went to BJ's last night with  number of friends. We got in pretty quickly for a Saturday night.

After a rocky start with one server a new one stepped in and the experience was flawless from there. Had the HopStorm IPA, which I think is great. I love the hoppiness of the beer.

I had BJ's Original Wings for an appetizer, followed by the new Beef Dip Sandwich, both were excellent.

Finished off with a shared Pizzokie Trio.

I love the consistently good quality of the food beer and service here.< /review><Rating>4<//Rating></record>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>I used to love this place but lately it seems the food and service have gone down hill. My husband and i used to frequent this place often because i loved the pazookie and he loved the appetizers. The last few times we ate here we have gotten sick. The servers didnt really check on us often and didnt really care.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Staff is friendly, pricing is as expected for a sit down restaurant, and food is tasty.  They do however like to use Panko bread crumbs for beer battered this or that... Not the greatest outcome when one is expecting a tempura-like batter.< /Review><Time>1499472337353</Time>< GmapID>

<Review>Restaurant wasn't busy but after we were seated it took over 20 mins to get our drinks. Our pizza took another 20 and came out just warm enough to eat. Server wasn't friendly either. I still like Bjs but will not return to this one.< /Review>< Pics>

Had to go out of our way to ask a waiter that didn't belong in our section and gave us the impression that he didn't want to. To top it off, there are many open tables so it's not that busy. Currently still waiting for our drinks now and it's going on for about 25 minutes now. HORRIBLE SERVICE! And feel like it's a racial problem< /text>< Pictures>

This establishment has taken a dive over the last 3yrs. My once 5 star from 4 yrs ago, went to 3 stars 2 yrs ago because they started screwing up orders.
Tonight we were charged twice, then told we had to place an order a 3rd time before they could refund the order and deliver.

BEWARE: The waitress stole the major portion of my $100 egift card and used it at another distant BJ's.  Did not find out until I tried to use it a couple of weeks later and there was no balance.  Use only small value gift cards that are completely used up!  There is no recourse from corporate or egift cards we learned.< /Text>

Good place for pizza and microbrewed BJ's beers.  There pizzas are deep dish and delicious.  They also offer some tasty options outside of pizza such as there balsamic chicken and cream cheese won tons (not sure if these are still available).  You will have to end your meal with a pozooki (sp?), a freshly baked cookie straight out of the oven that they throw a big scoop of ice cream on top and let it melt down to make a heavenly mixture of deliciousness.<//review>

Busy night last night due to graduation, but they still delivered our food quickly. I had atlantic salmon which was delicious. And of course the salted carmel pizookie afterwards. can never resist that.
Staff were as usual, fast and efficient and polite. Overall a good BJ's experience.</text>

<review>As I was walking back to my table, I noticed a server spitting in the food on their way out to deliver to an unsuspecting customer. I got my family and left immediately. The people working here seem to be very unhappy and annoyed with customers. I would be very careful when eating here. Who knows what else they might be doing to the food.</review>< user_id>

Upon my arrival at this BJ's, my friend and I were seated immediately. The place was practically empty,so knew would be in and out.  Wrong!  15 minutes went by and a single employee in this place came to our table to ask for our drink order let alone take our food order. We were very disappointed by their extreme lack of customer service that we left after 20 minutes. Usually I  have had a wonderful experience  BJs.  I went to the BJ in Torrance and the customer service was wonderful. In the that we waited at this BJ'S to have someone take our drink order,more than 20 minutes;  I was seated, a drink order and my food order was taken.  I will never go back the BJs in Laguna Hills.<//Review>

Customer service is very bad at night.... Employess take long to greet you or sit you down, our Waiter Cory R was just very rude and unpleasant just kept rolling his head, like thinking to himself hurry up and kept walking away when we were trying to order and when we asked about something just quick rude answers like we dont have that or just quick fast no, place also smells, when you see clean the tables they just toss the rag over the table and to wipes done... worse experience than when he came to ask how we are doing or dropping of check he just put it down and walked away and said something but so fast we couldnt evem understand what he said<//text>

We arrived at 3:30pm for a late lunch. As we walked thuogh the door, the music was so loud that we
almost turned around and walked out. We asked to be seated in the quietest corner of the restaurant
even though we were seated next to the kitchen door, it was a pleasant booth. We called earlier to
make sure that lunch would be served when we came in. We were told after being put on hold, that
lunch would be served no matter what time we came in. We ordered the unlimited soup and salad,
chicken quesdillas to start. Both were delicous. The chicken quesdilla only had 4 small pieces. It
should have had 4 more pieces. We then ordered the chicken tacos. They were delicous but very messyand too doughy.Even though we were very happy with the food, the waiter made a mistake and charged us the dinner price of $9.50 instead of the lunch price of $6.50. When I brought it to his attention, he informed me that he did not know that we had ordered off the lunch menu. He should have offered to correct the bill. What had happened was that a shift change happened in the middle of the meal, but since he didn't, we still paid the bill and left him 30% tip. Overall, the place was loud and extremely cold. The service has approved 100% since the last time we were there. We stopped going to our local BJ's because the service was so bad and managers were so indifferent to our
complaints about the service. That is why we only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 stars. We will definitely go back.      Judy&Frank</Review>

<review>Ihad the black and blue burger with a co worker who had the lasagna. DONT TRY EITHER!! We both got two or three bites i and I told the waitress i couldn't force it down my throat. We hadn't eaten all day either. His lasagna was ravioli 's covered with so much cheese it was like eating a block of romano. at least the beer was ok and the waitress was great. I could tell by the look and tone she portrayed that she wasn't shocked by my admission. I worked the industy for years, and felt bad telling her that blue cheese and ranch don't go together. But I still tipped good for the two beers.. JAIL FOOD IS BETTER!! I will never eat here or any bj's again.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Never again. When it takes the manager 20 minutes to change a tv channel so I can watch what I came during lunch to watch, then they've got bigger problems to deal with.   Two stars because I usually like BJs but never this one again.< /Review>

Food is Terrible, service is even worse. Last night I ordered a pink lemonade and after two sips of the pink lemonade I looked at the bottom and there was a crumpled up receipt in the bottom of my drink. Once I told the waiter that there was something in my drink all he did was laugh about it without an apology<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) One is forced to leave by putting the bill on the table in the middle of the main course. The food is also underground. This is nothing for Europeans with culture!

Man wird genötigt zu gehen, indem die Rechnung mitten im Hauptgang auf den Tisch gelegt wird. Das Essen ist auch unterirdisch. Für Europäer mit Kultur ist das nichts !< /Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I recommend to watch the offer of the day and the children's menu. Can be with friends or with children - a great place. Any beer before ordering you can try, tell the waiter and he brings to the sample.

Рекомендую смотреть предложение дня и детское меню. Можно с друзьями или с детьми,- отличное место. Любое пиво перед заказом можно попробовать, скажите официанту и он приносит на пробу.< /Text>
