Excellent wine selection, with a good selection of California wines (including some wines from lesser known Northern CA regions) along with some international wines. Prices were reasonable and the pours were generous. We had the bruschetta and it was excellent! Atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, and all of staff we interacted with were friendly and knowledgeable.</Review>

FAVORITE Wine Lounge EVER!!!! I mean, 5 stars doesn't do it justice! It is super cute, staff is so friendly, the food is AMAZING the chef Phil is so talented in what he does. The owners Jeff & Jeremy are so involved and care about their customers and it is just welcoming. We have never had a bad experience since they have opened. I recommend Platinum to anyone who enjoys good wine and a relaxing atmosphere! Thank you guys! You are all great! Cheers <3<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Really enjoyed this place. They had great service and charcuterie boards. I didn't try the charcuterie really, but my friend's seemed to really like it. They got the Bavarian pretzel board as well, and there was no pretzel left when it was time to go.
The build your own wine flight is an awesome idea!
I ordered kne wine initially that I ended up being not very fond of, but the wine lounge was accommodating and replaced the glass with something else better.
Good service, great, open and airy modern-lined environment. I'd definitely recommend going here.
I actually like it much better than House of Oliver if you need a comparison. House of Oliver is very dark inside and kind of cave like, like a wine cellar. But Platinum Wine is well lit, open and enjoyable. I will be returning here.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x809b21485eee70cb:0x717fa4dc264cbace<//gmap_id></record>

<text>I got 2 of 4 mystery wines right and was pretty stoked about that. Yummy pretzel board and cute charcuterie board were not anything sensational but a good value.

If I could give 6 stars I would! Great wine selection, many of my favorites from Lodi and Fairplay wineries. The staff were so friendly and attentive and provided excellent service. Food was tasty too. This is our new favorite spot!<//text>

Great staff that is very knowledgeable about the wine they carry. The ambiance is exactly what you want for a wine bar as well. Highly recommended for a little Friday or Saturday night out.<//review>

Attempting to have a memorable milestone birthday celebration during these times can be a very trying thing.  Platinum Wine Lounge made that happen this weekend for my sister.  We rented the back room for a small gathering and from the time we walked in to decorate we received excellent service.  The waiter assigned to our party was very attentive, made sure the appetizers were served in a timely manner, cleared away the dishes so we could continue to enjoy our time.  Did a lovely job with the cake presentation and serving.  The owner introduced himself to us and checked in our us mid way through.  He also arranged to have the live performer sing Happy Birthday.  It was a very memorable evening and everyone enjoyed the food and wine.  The owner mentioned they just opened up a few weeks ago, so please show them some love and support by visiting them for a glass of wine and some food.< /Text>

This place is fantastic! The food and drinks are amazing and the service is exceptional! Everyone really goes out of their way to give you the best service there. I really love the atmosphere too. Even with the closing of the inside with COVID and having to seat everyone outside, my friends and I were getting served with all smiles even in the scorching heat! I'm pretty sure I've met all the owners and they are great guys. I am now a customer for life!< /text>

<Review>First time here with 4/5 friends. I purchased the Platinum flight which was excellent. Nice to see an expensive bottle of wine served by the glass. Charteruteri board was excellent ( I left the selection up to the chef). 2 other's had a nice (expensive) Chardonnay by the glass and one had the house offering from the central coast, which was also excellent at $6.00 a glass. The chicken skewers with tazekie was excellent, as was the salmon and a panini.
It was nice and quiet until about 5:30 when a large group of women changed that. No social distancing.
Very comfortable chairs. Great wait staff.
Looking forward to returning.< /Review>< Date>

*Best service in Roseville (seriously, Mike is amazing)
*Swanky comfortable decor
*Reasonable prices on food, wine and beer
*Good vibe!  It’s just that intangible quality. I can’t put my finger on it, but this place is so different from other places around here. The vibe is classy without being snobbish.

We were so excited to be a part of the soft opening of this great new local wine venue.  Very few places do such an amazing job of featuring both local wine and beer options with the ideal small plates to pair with the drinks.  A knowledgeable and super friendly staff help to put this place over the top. This was our first time visiting, but definently will not be our last.</text>

Always clean, and so far I never had to wait for a washer or a dryer. Small, medium ,large, and extra large washers . For all your needs.
Always good to go back.< /Review>

I also agree, disregard the bad reviews. You can’t please everyone no matter what you do. I found out after meeting Daniel the owner, this is a family business for about 40 years. Machines are in great shape, baskets too. Place is clean and in a good location. Free WiFi also, hours are great (7-10 every day), and it’s cheaper to wash on Tuesdays I also learned.</Review>

My clothes don't get clean well enough and I hate spending money but yet my clothes will still have stains because its very necessary.  I'm not sure if its because their trying to save money. But being stingy made me and a couple of my girlfriend to start washing elsewhere.  We have kids and need our clothes clean .

<Text>It has been many, many years since I have used a laundromat. I was apprehensive at first because you never know what you are going to get. When I went looking online to see what was out there it appeared that there were a lot less laundromats than I had expected to see.  I decided to try Launder Land because it was conveniently within my route and close to the other activities I needed to do as well. When I first got there I noticed a man mopping the floor and thought that was a good sign. I walked in to check out the machines and everything seemed cleaned and in good working order. There were no machines with "out of order" signs on them. There were several other people in there as well which I thought was an another good sign. So I grabbed my laundry and went to it. Had I done my laundry at "home" I would have had roughly 7 loads and it would have taken me all day and night. I was washed and dried all within an hour and 40mins. WOW!!!! 1:40 to do 7 loads of laundry!!!! I may need to start doing my laundry this way for a while. I did hear the gentleman that was mopping the floor say he had just purchased the establishment from his Father and that he plans to be replacing several of the double washers in the near future. Thank you "New" Owner, I will be back!< /Text>< username>

<text>Dryers cost a dollar for 15 minutes, rip off. Sink is off for a pre-wash treatment, unacceptable. Bathroom is closed to public, unacceptable.

No one here to help. I counted 12 people not wearing masks. Despicable trailer trash. No phone number posted to call in complaint. With Covid 19 prevalent everywhere,  there shoud be an attendant here to follow the state's law. I feel dirty leaving this place.<//Text>

<UserId.>100485209461973164272< /UserId.><review>I don't know why so many negative comments. The top loader washing machines are clean and wash my clothes better then the washer we have in our rental place. $1.50 Tuesdays are a good deal! You can do two loads of wash. The dryers say to put 2 loads in for optimal drying. Like the 2 loads of wash I just did? Not very clear with the instructions. I bring my own soap detergent, sometimes people are kind and leave some of their own. Also, one time the machine ate 2 of my quarters and nothing....so be sure to bring in extra quarters.< /review>< Time>

I like to go wash here. I don't have any issues, except when the people from Motels that come and just dry their towels and sheets. They take up all  the space and  don't leave any dryers for the customers that do wash here. I don't think that's fair<//Text>

Not busy. Messy and somewhat dirty. People seem to keep to themselves, which is nice. I am afraid of my clothes getting stained from washers and dryers... But well I am here already. If you are looking for a maybe emergency laundromat then this can be an option but I don't know how weekends or other hours of the day are like. We will see.< /review><Rating>3< /Rating><Name>Angela Julio< /Name>< Pictures>

The machines work (top loader), never use top loaders.  Dryers work well also and can get too hot for delicate fabrics, but there is a temp control knob that seems to work as advertised on every one that I have used.</text>

Would not recommend this place.
Will not return.
My clothes smelled weird after drying. Like old fabric softener. I dont use fabric softener so must have been coated in the machines over years. Had to wash clothes all over again somewhere else. Waste of money and most important to me - time.
At end of drying cycle, one of the dryers was cold! So yeah, a load of wet clothes and then a load of smelly dry clothes I had to leave with.
No staff around to get refund for money wasted in that dryer.
Half the dryers were out of service.
All machines very old. But price didn’t reflect this.
I now go all the way to Grande Laundry which is complete different experience than going to this place in my neighborhood.<//text>

The owner is onsite regularly, so the place is maintained and clean. There is video surveillance. There is no bathroom and the sink is turned off. The machines and dryers are in good working order. There is a CVS and 7-11 in the same shopping center. Single loads are $2 except on Tuesdays, they are $1.50. There are 2, 3 and 4 loader washers as well. I believe the 4 loaders cost $6.25. I'm not sure about the other washers. The dryers cost a minimum of 75 cents for 12 minutes and a quarter for additional 4 minutes. It costs me about $2.25 for 34 minutes and the dryers hold around 2 to 3 wash loads. There is a TV tuned to CBS.<//Text>

I have been to this coin laundry a few times and it is expensive with run down equipment. Today(Dec.7 2018) they replaced 10 old dryers with slightly less older dryers. They hadn't placed any signs up saying they only had 11 drys available to dry. People sitting there with loads and loads of wet clothes waiting for a dryer. Horrible< /text>

<rate>4</rate><review>When the washer or dryer breaks down at home guess where you end up? Yup...the local laundromat. I have always hated to do this but you got to do what you got to do when the machines go down. This place was pretty clean and not too many strange creepers hanging out, but I wouldn't put it on my list of places to hang out on a Friday night. The few times I was forced to go a few of the washers and dryers were inoperable and it was busy so things got a little challenging.<//review>< pictures>

Good and not super packed in the morning depending on the day. Also a $1 for single loads and goes up a $1 for each cycle so a two loader would be $2 and so on<//review>

sink that doesnt work, expensive to wash and dryers are like 3mins per quarter, the only reason for that extra star is because they have a 2dollar top loader but I hate top loader I felt it didnt clean my clothes. never coming back< /review>

< Review>
Having spent most of my adult life in NYC & then downtown San Diego when I moved here, I’ve been to my fair share of laundromats. I could only wish every place & experience as pleasant at this one. The facility is clean, the machines work, the ones that don’t are marked as such & the dryers WORK! No drying your clothes for 2 hours to get totally dry. 30 mins & I’m solid on a full big load of clothes. The only downside however is that there isn’t someone there at all times. I do see the owner check in pretty often at times. There is no “office” or anyone there if needed suddenly. No emergency phone number or anything, even googled once when someone made a huge mess that I felt shouldn’t be left & wasn’t safe. There have been a few times I’ve cleaned up after other customers dripping pools of water out the back door after washing curtains, spilled soap & a soda once. There is no mop or paper towels, or anything available for spills, there is a sink but the water is off to it. I actually used my own towels & once a microfiber mop head I had just washed to clean up simply because I didn’t want to see anyone bust their butt. One time  I came & the machine was completely out of change, people were coming in - going to make change then leaving. Someone who had likewise already loaded wash with soap & all - figured out that the soda machine would make change - win! Improvise.

All in all - I really appreciate this place. It’s clean. It’s safe. It’s in working order & there is a bank right across should you need more money than you thought to wash or forgot to hit an ATM beforehand. Coffee, food & gym in walking distance in the same shopping center - nice to walk over for a coffee while you wait for stuff in the wash or dryer.</Review>

No customer service on-site or phone number listed in store or website. Dryer # 14 stole .75 cent ( would not start ),

For some reason the clothes are coming out of the washers dripping,
Which means of course it takes twice as much money to dry your clothes, what use to be a 1 is now 2.25 to dry one load of clothes.... time to find a new laundry location!<//Review>

Most of the washers are broken with no signs or any owner or worker around to help refund the 20$ worth of wasted money put into their very old and useless washers<//Text>

My dad had a storage unit with this unprofessional storage facility. He passed away June 19th of this year. I inquired what I needed to do to gain access to his storage unit in order to clear it out. Pretty much they needed the death certificate, which took me nearly a month to obtain. I walked this in and allowed them to make copies of that and my ID to get the unit released.  It is now October 8th 2020 and no action has been taken to resale this matter.  Numerous calls I have made. All I hear are excuses. There's no reason other than laziness on their part. Nothing in this world takes this long to process. Even civil agencies are quicker than these yahoos.  I have possession of his key to the lock and the gate code. I just want to put this behind me and resolve all issues stemming from my father's death. I just contacted corporate.

I rarely leave a review, but for Martha I had to. She's one hard working person. I was there this Saturday and she was by herself handle literally 3 people and all happy with her being friendly and running. For 2 people ahead of me she handle us in less than 5 minutes. I've been to other storages and it takes long. BTW, Martha laughter is uplifting, thank you<//Text>

Every time I went to this place which was as little as possible we witnessed something shady, from drug deals to people living there, and a staff that just looks the other way. Really raunchy place that I don't even want to elaborate on more. Go literally anywhere else, preferably somewhere reputable that actually uses their security system and drives the grounds before locking up. I would give them negative stars if possible.<//review><Rating>1< /Rating><UserId.>115980338051131316576</UserId.><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

First month was $20 just to attract customers, then went up to $187 a month for a space size of little Fiat 500. Make sure shop around and read the fine print. Not a good deal. Try to get a storage on Valley Blvd, I'm sure is cheaper and more friendlier staff.< /Review>

Convenient location;  however - after a few months they will raise monthly fee on a regular basis. So, not good for long term storage, but they have other locations in the area that are.<//review>

At first I gave this company a 3 and now that everything all come to conclusion I'm surprised this company is still even open. I regret putting my things here! They DO NOT work with you, CHARGE you with random fees, then when it comes down to payments they don't even give receipts you have to REMIND them and if you forgot Good Luck!
Don't let what happen to me happen to you just skip this place!<//text>

Very expensive. They get you in for 99.99 and it blows up to 300. After 6 month. And when I got my stuff out. It stunk like Pee. Take a look at all the mouse droppings along the sides of your unit. And the mouse traps threw out the entire facilities. I had to wash everything. I had water damage on my antique dresser. Which was covered by insurace. But the damage done by Mice isnt covered. It's considered a loss. I had to dump alot of things that got ruined. Wrap your stuff up with plastic. Or saran wrap. It gets smelly.<//Review>

<text>I would rate this location a 0 if i could. They have recently changed management and the current manager is not only unprofessional she can never seem to have a clear answer and cannot provide reasoning as to why certain changes are occurring. I really MISS LISA she was the best she always communicated changes via email, phone or postal service and was always willing to help. Whichever method she used for communication I always received it.  Back in January i went in to make my payment noticed someone else was assisting other than Lisa I asked about her  they just said she was out for the day but took my cash payment . (of course) Never was i told when i was making my payment that the following month in February that my Rent would increase and additional $55 dollars "because my promotion had ended" When i asked why i was not notified about the increase i was told they don't have to notify me because it just happens after the 12 months are up. I was upset at the fact they had the chance to notify me that 1. Their was going to be a change in management 2. That when i maid my previous months payment they should of notified me the following month that my rent would increase  3. If Lisa was still the manager she would of notified me and or called me if she would of forgot to tell me when i had gone in to make a payment      The managers response was "okay."  "we are not obligated to notify you, your 12 month are up " to which i responded that "I would be moving out soon" . I was so Upset and did not feel like continuing going back and forth over the matter i paid the now $228 monthly from then i started clearing out most of the Storage but still made the payment in March of another $ 228. Yesterday i went in to make this months payment and when i get there and now they tell me my rent is $252 a month  an additional $24 dollars increase . When i question the increase the manager tells me they mailed out the notification in February about the increase. To which again i reply with why was i not notified in March when i made the payment. At  this time my rent has increased a total of $76 dollars in less than a 3 month time span and ever since Lisa left. =(   At this point i am completely UPSET and refuse to continue renting at this location so i ask what a prorate would be for me to move out by the following Friday as this week i will have to travel for work on Wednesday and will be back the following Tuesday.  She said she can only offer me a Pro Rate until this Friday and i must be out by 5 p.m. I asked her to show me other units because i don't think i can move out by the 15 but might need to store my left over items.  When she is walking around to show the units she keeps grunting and not really trying to show me a location i asked for something close to my current unit she tells me there is nothing available and walks me to the other corner of the facility. As i get back i ask her to quote me on the pro rate and she gives me $129.50 until the 15th and asked for my card i handed it to her but asked her to provide me statement first of all my payment and to provide m e quotes for the units i had viewed.  She handed me the  copy of my statement and continued to look at her computer i then asked what my pro rate would be until the 13 th since i wont be here until the 15th and would have  to be out in 2 days by Wednesday since i will be leaving for work she says o i already processed your payment until the 15th . To which i reply what  why if i did not authorize you to process it and i am still trying to figure out my options.  I told her repeatedly that i had not received the notice that they had supposively mailed out in February and that being a rental and a notification of increase this should have been mailed via certified mail so that i could acknowledge the increase. She said that corporate mailed out the notices .. She then said i can reverse the transaction and re bill you until Wednesday @ this point my 7 year old daughter is getting restless and wants to leave.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1492111168385, 'text': "Hi Esmeralda - Our company values our customer's and their concerns.

They have clothes for 3 dollars and the price point for regular priced items is less than 30 dollars . I found their sizing to be on point . im 5'6 120 lbs and I fit a size small. Great selection of styles .</review>

Store refused to honor their online prices. I was advised by a store associate to contact their customer service department and ask if they would authorize a price adjustment.The item I wanted was priced at $129.99 in store and $79.99 on their website  (and it was sold out online). The store manager denied the request and tried to offer me a 15% discount for my next visit. I never experienced such poor customer service from H&M and I've been a loyal customer for several years.< /Review>

<Review>Great little winery with fine wines. Our host was Brandon? and he did a superb job, made our visit so special. This place would normally rate 5 stars except for.............

So this place has a criminal themed decor with a mini prison cell and museum; there are booking mug shots of famous criminals posted all around. Front and center, around the large fireplace are the criminal lovers Bonnie & Clyde; EXCEPT it’s not a picture of Bonnie (it’s her sister Billie Jean Parker). While there are many famous photos of Bonnie Parker I don’t believe she has an official booking mugshot, she was only arrested and place in jail once (Kemp, TX early 30’s)</Review>< Pictures>

<review>This little winery roars like a lion. Friendly, fun with a bonus of great wines and something unique for this area, charcuterie boards to enhance the experience. It’s casual and relaxed like wine tasting with old friends.< /review>< pictures>

It's a great little winery! Nice wines at a reasonable price. Love the wine and cheese pairings at the tastings. It's nice to order their delicious charcuterie board and enjoy it with a nice bottle of wine on their lovely patio. They often have some great live entertainment on the weekends! There is also a wonderful gift shop managed by Blair that has beautiful and unique gift selections.< /review>

I thoroughly enjoyed my wine tasting experience on my first visit, that I became a member.  The owner and personnel are friendly and very knowledgeable .  The pairing of wines and cheeses is something I've not experienced at any of the wineries in this area.   I also enjoyed listening to the music on Sunday afternoon and the members pick up event I attended was fun, I look forward to attending more.< /review>

Great wine in a very unique prison museum tasting room. Several wines are paired with cheese. They have a small gift shop. Just off the freeway, worth a stop even if you don't drink wine.<//text>

Solitary Cellars provides a stellar wine tasting experience in every aspect. The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The wine speaks for itself and is a gem of a winery in our central valley! The cheese pairings are perfect...you literally cannot go wrong with any of the combinations. To top it all off, Solitary Cellars is openly supportive of our service men and women and correctional officers. They just keep getting better over the years! Keep it up, gentlemen!<//text>

This place has great wines and a great atmosphere.   You can't go wrong with a bottle of red or white.  They also have wine accessories that are great. If you like wine, try it here and you'll love wine.  The Barbera is mine favorite but I will drink any of their wines. Highly recommend it and hope you give them a try.  Look into the wine club as well. If you sign up for it tell them I told you about it.</review>

<review>Awesome smaller retailer. Very attentive to your tastes and have some fun tasting events to meet any personal style. We don't get through that way very often, but stop by when we can. We always gotta visit when we get some port just up the road.< /review>< Name>

LOVE LOVE LOVE Solitary Cellars! You get it all here! From the spacious lawn shaded by a giant tree that holds awesome summer tribute concerts, to the inside of a jail cell and prison museum! Oh and some pretty AMAZING wines 😉  Greg & Rick (the owners) are great hosts, always welcoming and ready to chat share a glass of wine with you! And don’t forget to order one of their perfectly paired charcuterie boards! No matter if you’re coming for an event or just a casual wine tasting, you’re going to love this place!< /Text>

This place has it all.  You would not expect the level of quality they provide to be associated with such a down to earth personal experience.  Every time my wife and I visit to pick up our shipments that are included with membership the red carpet is rolled out.  They pull out all the stops putting on tastings for us of new and classic wines not to mention their great selection of pairable cheeses.  Of all the winery memberships this is our favorite!</review>

Not a Chardonnay fan but enjoy Old Vine Zin, Barbera and Lifer (which is sold out).

They remember their customers and talk about real stories. It's so much fun. The wine tastings are a full 1 oz so you know its a good pour. The vibe here is just chill and fun. Their charcuterie plates are delicious and worth the price!!! They are next to APCAL so when they have concerts you can reserve a table on the patio.

As a wine enthusiast and a member,  I do not give 5 stars lightly.  Solitary Cellars is one of the best kept secrets in the valley .From Cab’s to Zinfandel they have a wide selection of very well thought out varietals that compete with some of  the best wines in the Paso Robles region. They also have great blends like “Ball and Chain”  “Code Three” “Lifer” & “Los Grilletes”:  The best part is there is no need to travel far for great wines.  The blends are excellent,  and the Barbera is one of my favorites along with a magnificent Pino Noir. Couple that with excellent service and you will certainly have an excuse to give them a try. I'll bet you'll become members as well. Tell them Edmund sent you.< /review>

I called last night as soon as i found out my nephew was arrested and they answered right away Alexa helped me bail out my nephew this was my first time bailing anyone out so she was very patient with me and understanding she explained the entire bail process over the phone and answered all my questions. I wanted to leave this review because i really appreciate her honesty and wanted to shout her out because she was awesome! I had previously called another company and they were very rude and did not make me feel comfortable at all. The payment plan they worked out for me made the process so much easier and my nephew was out fast. I really appreciate you guys for helping me bail him out hope to never have to go through this again but if i do i will definetly be using you guys again.< /Text>

The bail agent who helped me out was on top of everything and that definitely made me feel at ease she was very knowledgeable and had the answers to all my questions. I honestly dont know what i would have done without yall! She literally did all the work and and my lil bro was out the same day i was extremely terrified for him specially during this pandemic he has never been incarcerated and i wanted him out fast! thanks to your amazing agent she was able to do that for us and i also liked how she was very clean and took in consideration of our safety during the pandemic she had hand sanitizer ready for us and gave us all a pen of our own and she had her face mask on the entire time.< /review>

Alexa provided us with excellent customer service! She was fast, professional, and reliable! What more could you ask for. My girl called her up and she was able to get my father in law out of jail quick. She even gave us a military discount for him being a veteran 👍🏼<//Text>

Go check out their 3 star Yelp.
They are only extending bail payments for 3 months due to Covid-19. Courts were closed, cases are still delayed.

THEY WILL MAKE YOU PAY THE WHOLE BAIL AMOUNT AGAIN IF THE CASE IS STILL ONGOING AT THE YEAR MARK.

I called other bail companies and they let me know they don't do it because it's unethical. Another reason why to stay away from this crooked company.<//Text>

Thank You Alexa for all of your help during this time! If you are in the need of bail services I would recommend giving this company a call! They were professional and empathetic during this difficult time. Alexa understood the holidays is a tough time on finances She set me up on a great payment plan and was able to qualify me for a 20% discount on the bail .  Thank you again!</Review>

<review>They provided such a great customer service they treated us like family and explained the entire process my mom and my sister were able to understand everything since our agent was bilingual we were able to communicate with her without a problem. The main reason why i am giving them a review is because not only did they give us a discount but they were kind enough to meet up with us at my moms house since she doesn't have a car we were able to bail out my brother that same day and the process was pretty fast. Honestly i cant thank you guys enough for helping us bail out my brother thank you guys for being there you guys are awesome!</review><gmapID>0x80c2c642ff0cc1d1:0x6fb36989a6b6706d</gmapID><user_id>103481427449598347748< /user_id><date>1566946166936< /date>< rate>

<review>I gave absolute bail bonds a call for a family member due to the great reviews they have. I spoke to several people, they all took the time to explain the bail bond process step-by-step. I ended up getting my first month for free, I would most definitely recommend absolute bail bonds for bail bonds help.<//review><rate>5< /rate><resp>{'time': 1515104263133, 'text': 'Thank you Joe for reviewing our company, we are glad to read that you were able to take advantage of our 1 month of promotion.'}<//resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<text>Excellent company! The agent I spoke with today was friendly and knowledgeable seemd like she knew what she was talking about. Ive had bad expiriences with other companies I found online.  She calmly explained how the bail bond process works and what my options were. They got the bond posted very fast and professionally. I recoomened this company to anyone that needs help with a  loved one that went jail, I didnt know about bail bonds but now I feel a lil more confident with what to do god forbid my boyfriend goes to jail again.< /text><userid>114716378348604859031</userid>< pictures>

One of my best friends got into trouble, and as always who comes to the rescue? Me!!! big jo jo..lol Well I don't want to get into detail as much, but what I do wanna say is, the help I got from Absolute Bail Bonds was really good. I was able to talk over the phone with the bail bondsman, we went through everything and in the end I got good news I qualified for the zero down. And on top of that I got a sick ass payment plan that fits my budget. I mean what else can absolute do?...ha ha thanks again i'm glad I found you guys, if my other friends get into trouble, I hope not! but i will be sure to hook em up with them digits.</Review>

I can’t give zero stars or else I would, i took my 07 suburban here and my Jetta on the same day back on August of last year and Once maybe 2 years back, the first time they left my air filter housing loose and none of the screws were holding it down, and just yesterday I go to do my oil change myself which I usually do but last time I got lazy thus taking it to Jiffy Lube and I’m removing the drain plug and it was very tight and hard coming out, finally I got it off and the whole tip of it is stripped, then I come to realize that they cross threaded the oil pan and installed a helicoil to put the oil drain bolt back in, now usually this is something that Service writer should of called and informed me but nothing was written on my invoice and no one told me nothing, now I had to buy a new drain bolt and LUCKILY it went back in and it’s not leaking, but my oil pan is still cross threaded inside, who knows how many more oil changes it will last before the helicoil breaks and my oil pan has to be replace, horrible service will never go back again, the sad part is this is my very FIRST review ever.< /Text>

< review>
The manager’s appearance and demeanor was unprofessional.  He would not honor a valid coupon. Said we declined vacuuming and washing windows but we were never asked. Never checked brake fluid or transmission fluid. Said that lighting system was ok but never had me turn on the lights.  My husband is disabled and I count on Jiffy Lube for the safety of my vehicle.  I will never go to Jiffy Lube again.< /review>

<Review>Just a scam they said I needed brakes. My brakes had over 85% left when I confronted the mager said we must have made a mistake. They will say your vehicle needs something just to make a sale very dishonest.Picture of new pads next to my old pads that they said needed to be replaced.< /Review></record>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>On October 28, 2020 I took my car to be serviced at this location for an oil change. My car had no leaks prior to this day and was in good condition. The oil change literally took 5-10 minutes I noticed it was a little odd but didn't think anything of it because this was my third time bringing my car here. Not even a whole month later November 25, 2020 my car gave up on me on my way to work. I brought it to my mechanic and he said there was no oil whatsoever in the car. He advised me to call Jiffy Lube and they deny that it has anything to with their service I forgot to get the name of there person that I spoke to on the phone but I asked for his corporate number and he just gave me his boss number like if that's going to help. Now my engine blew up and I have to pay $2000 to replace my engine when I shouldn't have to. My mechanic refuses to touch my car because he doesn't want to mess it up any further unless he finds out what they did to my car. I've skimmed through the reviews and I noticed that I'm not the first to complain about an issues like this. One guy went into depth about how they messed up 2 of his cars and the owner never responded to the review. Why is that? He responded to almost every other review ...   I don't recommend especially this location. Take your money to Valvoline down the street!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Im not very happy with these people. I went in for an oil change and the staff was friendly and they had me in and out within 25 mins. But 2 days later my change oil light comes back on and immediately after that the check engine light comes on and car starts acting funny. So I pull over and check the oil since the change oil light just came on. And nothing literally nothn on my oil dipstick. They didn't refill my oil. They r lucky my engine didn't seize bcuz of their negligence. I do not recommend go in there<//review>

< Review>
I bought a car at an auction and it was really bad from the engine and it would have trouble starting. I came to this spot and they hooked me up with discount. There were things that would cost me and arm and a leg with other mechanics but here my wallet was safe. I recommend this place to anybody. They tell you what's wrong with the car and you decide if you want to pay for it or not. By  Antonio H.</Review>

<review>I had  been coming to Jiffy Lube since I bought my first car and I gave this location a try and that was my mistake. I was so upset with the service I received. Due to the pandemic I was told I had to stay inside my car at all times which is fine I understand so I put my trust in the staff with my car and they turn around and brake some things and don’t even tell me. The employees were careless with my car and broke my prop rod and broke a clip that was attached to my ac hose. I was shocked because after they broke it they left it in a random place underneath the hood which could potentially have messed up my car. I ordered the parts that were broken through the dealer, but I can honestly say I will never bring my car to a jiffy lube. It’s minor things that were broken but the fact that they “finished” service and didn’t even tell me makes me so upset. My thing is if they didn’t know how to handle my vehicle they could’ve asked me and avoid this carelessness.< /review>< response>

I said once before that I would never take my car for an oil change at Jiffy Lube from a previous horrendous experience and a ruined car. After nearly 20 years nothing has changed. Due to Covid19 I was needing a oil change and decided to take my Lincoln in for a oil change and that seemed to work out well at first (this is what I thought, will come back to this car later) so I decided to bring my Saturn in for the same thing, before they started I explain if they are not familiar with the process for this car then I will tell you that this drain plug must have a seal and if it's not installed correctly then it will leak also that their is baffles in the valve cover that only allows you to pour oil in slowly. This information was not heard, they acted as if they already knew. This was as far from the truth, when the work was done I left but moments later I smelled burning oil and pulled over, opened the hood and found oil all over the engine and that oil poured right on top of the catalytic converter and was smoldering ( this is how Jiffy Lube ruined my other Saturn caught on fire) so I returned and they attempted to clean of the oil with water and air, this did nothing, I returned home to find oil leaking from the plug that I explained About the seal. With My previous Saturn I returned and their fix was to keep tightening the plug untill they stripped oil pan and the plug, (oil pan and plug had to be replaced at the dealership) so the seal is there for a reason. Now the remody was to have a second and third opinion for the work was not performed correctly and also found no torque wrench was used to set the specs on the plug. I filed a compliant with the BBB and Bureau of Automotive Repair over the work and to make matters worse, remember the Lincoln I took in the beginning of this issue? Well it turns out on inspection of that work, the oil was changed but not the filter, the dirty, filthy, old filter that was on the car since the last change (by Firestone auto service) was still on the car, so that makes 2 cars with problems now after going back to Jiffy Lube. Never Never Again. Once this is inspected by the state so this can be documented. I will never return to any Jiffy Lube. I guess If your not a car person, then what you don't know won't hurt you, but it may cost you a lot of extra money and Time. It's just not worth it.</Text>

Best service I've ever received in these establishments. I highly recommend this place. I don't know if it was the manager or just another worker but this guy was great. He gave me great advice on my vehicle and thoroughly explained what they were going to do to my vehicle.  I've been to these places about 4 times and again, this place has given me the best service.<//Text>

<Review>Very deceitful employees.
I went in for an oil change and to check what the check engine light was marking. The assistant manager told me that there was water evaporating in my transmission and I needed a flush, that it would fix the problem, so they did the flush and didn't do it correctly. I had to go in the next day because there was a lot of transmission fluid leaking and wait over an hour for them to fix it again.
Then the day after that my engine light turns back on. I go in an again it's an evaporation issue, but it has to do with the gas, NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE TRANSMISSION. So now I have to go get the problem fixed by someone else because they can't find the problem.
So they lied to me to get to purchase a transmission flush and didn't fix a damn thing! I was lied to and they didn't fix anything!
Now all they can do is fill out an incident report and make me wait another week to hear back from them. Deceitful and very unprofessional.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Went in because of the $29.99 oil change special they were announcing outside their store. I have been to this location before with no issues but this time they tried to charge me $89.99 because they were going to use synthetic oil for my car even though I had not requested it. There was no mention of the 29.99 special I had asked about when I pulled in, they instead charged me $55 for the synthetic blend. However, the man who talked to me about my car brought out a dirty cabin filter and suggested I change it along with the engine air filter despite having replaced these myself that same week. They also tried pushing me to make other updates/modifications to my car when I only asked for an oil change. Only upside was that the oil change was quick and they topped off my fluids. Overall I don't think I'll be returning to this location as it seems they're only after the customers' money.< /Review>

I have always had the associates "top off" whatever I need in the car, i.e. antifreeze. This time, I went to get my oil change, the associate asked if I wanted "antifreeze" in my reservoir (spelling?) topped off -- since it was filled with water. That is strange, because last time -- I had it topped off with antifreeze (that was 3 or 4 months ago)  (ha?) I trust them with my car – should I not?< /review>< Pictures>

Well how do I start this!?
This guy named TONY ,he has a really bad attitude. I don't know why he still working here.  I  came for brakes chance only the front ones he come with me told me I need to change my back ones too,they don't even took off the tires to inspect them wth and my car is new  also came and told me you need new rotors why? .I told him you guys need to resurface the rotors that's it   he just wanted to sell  more stuff than what my car really needs.. he probably thought I was stupid and I didn't know anything about mechanics you are wrong sir and you need to change your attitude ...If you don't know how to work with customers this ain't the work that you should have!!! BAD SERVICE!!! I HAVE 2 HOURS HERE THEY ARE NOT EVEN HALF THE JOB SERIOUSLY...they are just goofing around talking smack etc etc ..they should be working   instead of doing nothing.</review>

<time>1491925457458</time><Rating>3</Rating><Text>They serviced my car surprisingly fast despite taking more time (30%-50%) than estimated. I was a last minute, early evening Saturday walk-in and did not expect to get my car serviced that day. I did think that was the most I paid for an oil change (>200%). The break down was ~$70 oil and ~$50 labor. Service includes a fluid inspection but any refills are extra. They could not find the fluid tanks in my car and despite telling me they would look into it, they almost let me leave without verifying that all fluids were full. I also noticed that they wash the window exterior and vacuum the car. They did a barely noticeable job on the windows. I saw no indication that the car was vacuumed. My car was to be cleaned after I did some work on it, and I noticed my oil dangerously low. I think that if a company includes superfluous services, they should fulfill them properly.</Text>< Pictures>

Poor service! Actually, no service, they didn't want to do an oil change on my car. I tired calling the service center to ask what exactly was the problem on my car so I can let another center know and they left me on the phone forever. I continued to call and never got an answer back.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) They left something loose in my car and didn't close the chest and they gave it to me, TERRIBLE.

This place is great! Their smogs are very fast (the fastest I’ve been to)

Also they do DMV services. I got a vin verification for my car which came from out of state.

It’s a one stop shop. Got my smog and DMV registration done here.  I was in and out within 10 minutes tops.

Great job guys!<//review>

<Review>Just finished my smog test. Owner was kind, friendly, fast and efficient. In and out in 10 minutes, like other reviewers have stated.  Better than any other Smog shop I been too. I recommend them no doubt! Speedy service and great price with coupons typically available on their website. Great customer service will keep me coming back as long as I live here.< /Review><Time>1551061613717< /Time><rating>5</rating><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809a9ff53b617ecb:0x823cfae584b480fe</gmap_id><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNLfJwupNgx7D-eyaEgjWSfdSMJTujEB9kvEcU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVl8jafJCv7cnTGSVJ6l6ygrorSlaS20SUxMyV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< user>

< Review>
Went there with my husband to get a smog check on our diesel truck, walked in to the office and turned in our documents he gave us back a document to sign and told us it would be $74.98. he walked out to the truck and opened the hood and looked at the air intake filter and immediately told us it failed because it was missing the eon number. He explained to us what to do next and charged us $70.00 and that it was going to be another $30.00 for a retest. I've asked around and I've been told retest's should be free? Please lete know if I'm in the wrong about retesting fees. Th< /Review>

1. The clerk clearly tried to swindle me for a more expensive service. I had the required paperwork clearly showing what was needed and he tried to upcharge me by $10.
2. He broke my drivers side window!  It'll be much more expensive to fix than the smog service.

Very disappointed in this shop.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

highly recommended by Google...yada yada yada, ALL LIES. After getting repairs done, I brought my vehicle in to get smogged so I could register it. Well, as it turned out, the price was not $27.95 plus:$8.50 DMV certificate...it was actually  $79.95, but they are going to give you $30 off making it $49.95 (Still not $27.95). On top of that,  if your is a truck, they want to charge $10 more...AND if you want to get a STAR certified smog, which is required by the state in order to get the vehicle registered get, it is $10 more!! AND, if it fails, they're still going to charge you and they won't do a free re-test after you get the repair done(which, in my case, was just driving a few more miles so the computer system reset itself).that is required LIARS and CHEATS! sheets Actually, I blame myself I didn't do enough research.  Don't make the same mistake...do not do business with these criminals!<//review>< Response>

Found this place on Yelp because they have a 5Star rating and they do deserve 5 star rating because of there quality work.
I was in and out with in 20 Minutes.
I brought my out of state Car in for Smog and New license plates.
They did a smog,vin verification and I got new license plates And i don't have to go to DMV that was a big relief.
Clean waiting room with TV, Wi-Fi and complementary water.

< review>
I come across this shop online. I bought a car from Idaho so it need to be smog and they were able to do a Smog Check, Vin Verification and Register my car in Minutes. Harry was very helpful with filling all the required Forms.
I was Done with Whole Process in 25 Minutes. Waiting Room was clean and comfortable definitely recommend to anyone who doesn't want to spend there whole at Dmv.
Great Job!</review>

Purchased a Brand New Car out of state, and had to get a Smog Check and Vin Verification before I can register it in CA. I walked in without an appointment and was on my way with a smog Check and Vin Verification in less than 20 min. Good Job well done. Definitely Recommended to anyone who's for smog check or Vin Verification.</text>

The pandemic was tough on a lot of us. I am glad to know that some companies can bring back old school ways in our modern days. This drive in was something I have always wanted to experience. Of course not how it happened due to the pandemic. I believe this is a great way to spend quality time, in the comfort of your vehicle, with friends, family or a cute first date. Restrooms can be used as long as you wear a mask. The concession stand are open to purchase food, snacks and beverages. I hope when things go back to normal this can be an option every other weekend. Stay safe, wash your hands and please wear a mask.< /text>

Great drive-in movie experience! Concession is still open indoors (masks required) so you can still enjoy warm popcorn in your car.</text>

Drive-In Theatre is open!  Easy parking.  They took one of their great projectors, moved it outside, and are projecting on a nice, large screen in the parking lot.  Highly recommend.</review>

<review>Man! This Drive-In Complex sure did save my Movie-Going Bacon! It was still showing Wonder Woman 1984 when other Drive-Ins had moved on! Please remember to purchase your tickets online or inside the Brick-And-Mortar Movie building Lobby before you drive into the spacious Drive-In parking Lot.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

The chairs need an upgrade, but we felt comfortable, they are leaving every other row empty and require parties to sit away from other parties, with. No more than 7 to a group.< /review>

My friend and I randomly stumbled upon this place during a visit to LA. We were looking for something fun and as we dropped off the subway, saw that they were doing a Wizard of Oz sing a long. Can you say perfect?
The theater is definitely old school. Absolutely adorable. The prices on snacks were affordable and staff seemed happy to be working there.</Review>

Cheap tickets buy junk food is pricey. Theater rooms are pretty big and doesn't smell bad.</Review>

This theater is beautiful and historic. Love the architecture and ambiance. I saw The Little Mermaid Sing Along here with my gal and guy pals and we had so much fun! It was fun watching and singing along to one of my favorite Disney movies! I loved the props! Anyway, the theater itself is very historic and so Los Angels. I love it! The ceiling arches and chandelier is so glorious and inspiring. Makes me want to pursue architecture as a hobby!< /text>

<text>Most people don't know but this place is a drive-in theater now the only drive-in theater in the San Fernando Valley it's $30 per vehicle and you can bring as many people in a car as you want it's a great deal the concession stand inside is still open you can get all of the snacks you show them your scan code on your phone it's contactless they scan it through your window another benefit is that the sound from the movie comes through a local radio station 87.9 when we went so further covid consideration The only way to see a movie in the theater now!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

When I searched for a nearby drive-in previously, this did not pull up. The location actually came via email from Fandago as a place to see the new Tom & Jerry movie. I was able to go online & pre-purchase a ticket. It was $30+$1 fee, per vehicle. We used our SUV with 5 pax. The lot attendant guided us to a spot based upon which direction we were parking the car (rear facing) to assure that we were not only socially distanced, but to also make sure we were not blocking anyone's views & no one blocking ours. This is a movie theater that was able to turn a part of their lot into a 1 screen drive-in on the side of their building. Kudos to them. They have done a wonderful job! Their concession stand was open. Prices were standard of a movie theater. I  spent $80 & we had 2 LG popcorn, 1 pack of cookies, 6 hotdogs, 2 pizzas, 1 nachos and 5 LG drinks. We used a Coke-A-Cola freestyle machine to select our own beverage choices. I had never visited this theater before, but I kind of hope that even once indoor movies resume, that they offer special drive-ins on occasion! It was really nice!</text>

There’s no policy on their website for the drive-in during inclimate weather. I called multiple numbers hours ago (and left a voicemail) as well as left an email — no one picked up after multiple calls (one is an auto-hangup) and no one ever responded to the email. I asked them to get back to me because I had quite a way to drive to get here. No one ever did. I arrived and was told it was cancelled. Given a pass to show up again when I’m free (my girlfriend works nights). If they could reimburse me for the gas and 30 dollars of pizza we bought for the car beforehand that would also be great.</text>

<review>When you somehow missed the first run of movies, come on this way. They get new movies quickly and the place is clean and the people working are cool. It's not the super loungers of the current megaplexes but it's just an old school spot.

One added plus, you have less expectations of films as you're paying less!<//review>< Pics>

The theater and restroom were clean, the staff polite and there were no technical issues with our showing of Frozen 2. We did not purchase any concession items so cannot comment regarding service or quality. I have been to this theater before and have always enjoyed my experience here.< /Text>

Awesome theater in a convenient location! So many wonderful memories of coming here! Lots of familes and other nice people, met a really nice family standing behind us in line for a Harry Potter film. Mostly polite employees. Safe, well maintained location. Lots of parking.

I miss this place!< /review>

Hope those of you that have been coming here for years continue to do so! Love this place hope it never goes away.< /text>

<Review>A very nice movie theater. Ticket window is outside as you approach the window. Tons of parking so there is not a long walk. Clean and air conditioned cool, not freezing. Popcorn was great. The unlimited soda machines with dozens of options is always fun. Bathrooms were nice and clean. Seats were standard, the screen was fine as was the sound. A nice time had.</Review>< Pictures>

<Date>1572963632922< /Date><Rating>3< /Rating><text>Typical walk in movie. Seats need to be replaced. Prices at snack bar outrageous and now no staff in the ticket booth. More jobs taken by automation but no price discounts for the customer. Went and saw Terminator on opening night and they didn't have it on a large screen. Thought that was a little sad being the reputation of that franchise. Eleven bucks for my ticket. Twenty six bucks for two cokes and a popcorn. Thirty seven bucks to see a movie on a screen I can almost outsize at home now. Might start waiting for dvd releases again. Much cheaper.< /text>< Pics>

This place was a dive until Chris became the manager.  He brings that Jamaican/British influenced sharpness to his young staff.  I feel safe there.  Kudos to him!<//review>

<Text>Decent sound and screen for a movie. Not an updated top of the line place. Old school neighborhood movie joint from early 90"s. Tix prices slightly lower than newer places. Friendly staff.<//Text>< Rate>

A nice regular movie theater nothing special. Some auditoriums have nice seats some are old and worn. They have coke icee which some places dont so that's nice. If it's a big movie release I would say go somewhere nicer. Other patrons will talk or use phone. No one really stops by to check inside. I would recommend unless it's a movie you really wanna see and enjoy.< /review>

<review>I’ve never had a good experience at this theatre. The projectors flicker in exposure levels it smells like popcorn farts and I’ve had multiple issues with people on their phone during movies. Went to see 1917 and it smelled like someone had dedicated themselves and had to leave early.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2972e57599e21:0x5fde5349c09e42e8< /GmapID></record>

<Text>My favorite local theatre, while it may be a bit faded on the outside don't let that stop you from going in. For inside you will find a truly comfortable movie going experience! They have very crisp sounding sound systems (and this does matter, i have been to movie theatres with terrible systems and this ruins the whole experience) excellently sized screens and a great ratio of spacing between the screen and the seats. Overall, always a great time the staff is friendly and really there are no downsides. Pro tip! Try to go during matinee hours, movie tickets cost 8 bucks and it's often quieter during these times. Highly recommended!< /Text></record>

If you want a claim and chill place you can definitely come to this place. It is quite and the movie starts on time. Definitely arrive early so you can ask for a hot dog it takes approximately 10 minutes< /text>

Soooo, it's just as I remember from jr. high and high school.... loud and lots of kids. I wouldn't go again with a group of adults only. But definitely with my god son and god daughters. I say this only because we found ourselves surrounded my kids/teens so I offer up the warning. But i still love going to the movies, I'll just plan accordingly.< /Review>

I like that it was empty-ish for a popular movie but it seats, floor, bathrooms need to be cleaned better. I understand that it can get dirty between movies but they can clean between changing movies. Food selection was ok but how do you not sell hotdogs during peak times. Need more cashiers it's a weekend. But overall customer service was great. Lots of smiles. Overall who knows might go again to see another movie I love the price especially with 3 kids n 2 adults</Review>

Currently here watching jumanji .they accepted my card to by tickets but asked for i.d with my debit card to buy popcorn.They didnt have an atm so i had to leave the theater to find an atm.Making me late for the movie.Then the concession clerk couldnt even remember my order and all i ordered was soda popxorn and nachos.She was so rude! Fyi i ordered 2 drinks 1 nacho and 1large popcorn.its cheaper to order them seperately than in combo.The straws are a cardboard type paper and get all loose and soggy in your drink and mouth.No air conditioning.Worst experience ever.Id rather wait and go to the 3 dollar theater on Bellingham< /Review>

A variety of movies and showtimes available to choose from. Part of it makes it feel like a classic movie theater and it's something really nice. My one problem I did have, however, was that there should be more security walking in the auditoriums to see if people are actually following the rules or have the proper etiquette while watching a movie. It got hard to enjoy what we were watching because there were people who walked in late and turned their flashlight on and phone brightness on max and shining the light into other people's faces. We had to tell them multiple times to turn their phone off. Another problem was the amount of time people would speak and shout during the movie. Honestly, this was the first time I've ever been to a movie theater and felt as if a physical altercation was going to break out</Text>

<Review>It's a budget theater as far as Regency investing much to remodel. The seats are uncomfortable in most theaters except for some where they bought used seats that were made in the past ten years and rock a little.

The staff is underpaid and overworked, turnover is high and the general attitude poor.

Projection is sub par, darker than it should be, probably to save money, and the sound is not exactly Dolby-perfection. Basically, it's a hood theater where the patrons are treated like poor cattle and it shows.< /Review>< Pics>

Best Movie Experience  In Town!! The
Regency has plenty of parking for $0! There are refreshments  for your enjoyment both upstairs and downstairs . If you want to play,  there are some old school video games in the lobby areas, and it's never over crowded . But what makes it so amazing  are the seats , which are PLUSH!  Seriously, the seats beat
any other movie joint  in town. Think of seats on an airplane only business class ! And
more space all around plus  plenty of room
for your legs ! All this for a  modest price tag. Check it out! You won't want to leave !< /review>

<review>I personally really like this particular movie theatre. The feel is a bit retro but that's what I like. There's a smaller but more comfortable feel to it that the newer theaters just dont have.
The employees are very nice and helpful.  They have the usual range of concessions to get before you go to your movie. And plus It's part of the strip mall, so you can go get a meal before or after you go to the movie you want to see.
The great thing is, this theater is part of that movement to show older movies on regular dates during the year (like Halloween,  blazing saddles,  Robocop,  etc). I'd highly recommend coming here for your movie enjoyment< /review></record>

<gmap_id>0x80c2972e57599e21:0x5fde5349c09e42e8<//gmap_id><review>Prices are good, I like the staggered seating, and the screens and sound are good. The seats are not as comfortable as some places, but I don't care, for the price I pay! And I have had my bag searched on occasion, but it doesn't bother me.

Clientele is hit or miss, but that's most theaters in L.A. There can be some idiots who think it's okay to talk as though they're in their living rooms, or text as though the light from their particular phone isn't annoying, but there are also times in this place where everyone is great...they're respectful of the fact that everyone wants to enjoy the movie.

There are video games in the lobby, too, in case you want to kill some time before or after the movie. Overall, this is one of my fave places to go to the movies.< /review>< date>

<text>My roommates and I go to this theater almost every week. They always have a good mix of new releases and movies that have been out for several weeks. The pricing is fair and if you can make in for early bird, which ends at 4pm, its even cheaper.<//text>< user_name>

<review>The theater is a little older and doesn't have the amenities of a modern theater. However, my wife and I usually come here for the matinees and the price of $7.25 can't be beat. We can buy two tickets to the newest released workout having to pay for an arm and a leg.< /review>< rating>

Nice enough. Good price. The seats need updating, but are comfortable, if you're going with a date or just like to sprawl the arms don't lift up.  Cleanliness was questionable (set my hand down on the rest beside me and it was wet with something). Would give 2.5 cause I feel a 2 is harsh, but not a 3 with the wet stick arm rest.< /Review>

<date>1543019619232</date><rate>4< /rate><text>Good experience overall, but would say that with one of the bathrooms being closed when I went, I noticed that we had to go in a bathroom with twice the traffic and incredibly dirty.  Stalls not flushed and smell of urine in the air.  The other downside is the facets are all hot.  No matter where you set it, it goes from hot to hotter and not very comfortable for my six year old son to use.  Outside of that, prices are fair and staffers are friendly.  Refills available for the large size popcorn.  Drink station is self serve but on an occasion or two, I found that the ice was not being periodically refilled as often as it could have been.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Lots of handicap spaces, easy to get in and out of. Easy to use ticketing kiosk. Nice rewards program. Has the self serve Coke machines that offer over 100 drinks. The only drawback is there are only two sets of bathrooms, both all the way down front of the theater.</review>

<Text>An older theater, but very clean. We purchased our tickets at the concession stand right along with our popcorn and drink. They had the new soda machines where you choose your drink, and any flavors you wish to add to it. It's very hard to see from the street, we wondered at first if our GPS goofed but it was spot on. We went to an afternoon matinee and the popcorn was stale, but on the plus side you get to put your own buttery topping on.<//Text><resp>None< /resp></record>

Not the cleanest not dirtiest theater. Chairs suck as do the kiosks. Routinely one is out. One fails to print and usually 3rd times a charm. So frustrating these machines are inconsistent but are suppose to be a convenience. Generally helpful staff but push for better service or show a bit of frustration due to their lack of professionalism and you can easily tell they don't give a f---! Big plus is that its nice to have free refills that I can pour on my own. Decent movie ticket prices as well as extended matinee prices.< /Text>

Been coming here since they opened back in 1998.  It's been great. The concessions has a good variety and management takes care of its customers as best as possible. It ain't perfect but is what it is.
However, the sound has changed.
The theatre no longer offers Dolby Digital as its main sound.  Before every feature, a quick Dolby Digital film was played to ensure sound quality. Now the sound has suffered.  The sound is ok but it's not Dolby.  Bring back Dolby, Regency.<//Text>

I rarely go to cinemas lately, but when there is a good movie that I really want to watch, this is the place I have been going for years now. They are OK, nothing crazy, just a place to watch a movie. I enjoyed, can’t say that I can’t wait to come back.< /text>

A stable in the area. Lots of movies show, and many discounts for student and early showings. Parking is great, kinda "long" to go to if you're not familiar with the area, and when you're done you can go to the general pavillion to chill and hang out. Lots of changes over the last decade from eateries to shopping to arcades.<//Text>

Great gem hidden in the valley. You wouldn't even notice this place if you were driving by it. But the place has huge screens and large seating so it's good for groups. Prices are fair and they have good spots nearby to eat after a movie if you want some grub afterwards.<//Text>

The theatre smelled, and the floors were sticky. Just didn't seem like they were cleaning the theatre very well between movies. The seats were very comfortable though, that is one positive.</Text>

I let my first terrible experience slide, but now that I have had two terrible experiences I see that it's more than just a rare occasion. The first time, I went to see the mule and the movie had several issues playing througout the whole time. I decided to leave and go to a different theatre. When I went to get a refund I overheard the manager over an employees walkie talkie giving him orders to give tickets to another movie or showing, me and the rest of the people there refused that offer and the staff seemed very hesitant on giving us our well-deserved refund. The second time was last night at the detective pikachu showing where my card was malfunctioning and I asked them to manually put the card on the computer, I asked numerous times as to why they could not do that and the only reason that was given was that "the manager wouldn't allow that" and I asked to speak to the manager and I was that I was only going to be given the same response, that she cannot do that. However, I've had it been done before and it did not affect anything. From my experiences it seems that the management is not good, they do not seem to have any of the new payment methods (wireless payment services such as: google pay and apple pay). If those reasons weren't enough the actual theatre isn't worth the full price of a tickets, any other theatre with the same ticket pricing gives a much better experience than this place. Last time I ever attend a showing from this place.</Text>

Beware of the red seating. Theirs a row of seats, marked reserved. And you will have a staff member breath down your neck, if you happen to not notice in a dark room. In other words, aggressive ushers, may dissuade your experience.</Review>

Okay movie theater. Nothing special. I wish their military discount was better. $8.50 for students and military and matinee pricing is $7.50. DBOX is cool but not really worth an additional $8. There's only 1 butter pump at the concession stand because 1 is always broken. So there's always a long line.<//Text>

The seats are better now but only some have arm rests that lift up. I also enjoy their $1 hotdogs (wish they had mayonnaise available). I also like that they carry horchata and orange bang. The bad part is the price for adult admission is about $10.50.</review>

This place is great for the price of matinees, especially the 1st show of the day. I like this place a lot however if you're looking for high-end seating picture and sound this might not be the place for you</Review>

This theatre is the best.  I like the staff.  They are very friendly.  I take my son there weekly and we have our routine.  He plays in the claw machine, then we buy the popcorn and put butter; he also likes the original flavor frozen yogurt and Nachos with jalapenos and the fountain drink.  If the movie is bad, the management there reimburses the money or let's you watch another movie.  I always have a great treatment there.  It's a terrific team!< /Text>

<Review>Low prices, good movies.  What else can you say?  The only rub is the crowd that comes in, while most are good people who are just coming to see a flick there are also some seedy characters who show up and there have been fights on occasion.  Just steer clear of that and you'll be good.< /Review>< Rating>

Small screens and REALLY uncomfortable seats.

I live maybe a 10 minute walk from The Plant, I'm a huge movie goer, probably go to the movies twice a month and have visited this location 3 times in the past 4 years. I will always go out of my way to go to a better movie theater.

Nothing wrong with this place but nothing special that's why only 3 stars.  Like any cinema it's packed on the weekends especially with with big movies. I ALWAYS go during weekdays before 20:00 and usually only share a room with 2 or 3 other people. Everything is cleaner quieter even the food is better.<//Review>

It's cheaper than AMC. But the seats need repair, they are like 20 years old  or more . There is no cushion only springs in some of the seats making it very uncomfortable to sit on .  I know it's cheaper but for this condition it should be cheaper.<//text>

Lastly their rewards program card don't seem to work more than once, the cashier don't see that your points are available for certain offers.<//Text><username>James Jones</username><date>1488492010196<//date><gmapID>0x80c2972e57599e21:0x5fde5349c09e42e8<//gmapID></record>

<review>This theatre is ok, it has recently replaced its old chairs but a lot is lacking. From its lack of trust of its customers and mediocre food stall. Arcade games there often dont work as well and take your money, if youre only there for the movie its not the best experience especially with a lot of talkative people in the theater.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Been here probably 10 times and here's an honest review: The people are great. Spoke with the manager a couple times, shes really cool. When its a busy an older gentleman takes people inside to buy their tickets from an atm looking ticket machine. The younger kids they have working there are always talkative and friendly. As far as food pretzels are made fresh to order, popcorn is always hot, and they have premade hot dogs. I had a couple good ones and a couple bad ones. Good thing they were a dollar and I didn't expect much for a dollar. The movies are on time, volumes good, never encountered a technical issue, and I have seen some big movies in big theaters with only 2 or 3 other people in the entire place. In all the worst thing about this place is I eat too much for only about 12 bucks every time I go. A+</text>< user_name>

This is my local movie theater.  I like that there is always plenty of parking.  The theater is located in the back area of a shopping center  ( Home Depot, Ross, BabiesRUs) but it is located next to a police training station.  I have been coming here for years and have never had any problems.  The only thing I have noticed is  that it seems to be more frequented now.  Which is a good thing !  There is a machine where you can buy your tickets just inside the doors in case there is a long line to buy tickets.......<//Text>

Pretty great place! Been coming here since I was a kid. Popcorn is great and the inside looks awesome! Although after al these years the carpet is really starting to stain and look bad. And if you end up watching a not-to-popular movie at the time you'll end up in a smaller theater room where the seats are absolutely disgusting. Im talking no cushion, black in stains and stick everywhere.</text>

The theatre was clean and well managed. The food prices were average compared to other theatres. One thing that stood out was the fountain drinks were self serve, basically free refills.</text>

<Review>Okay cheap theater. Some chairs on some showings are out dated but there are some newer ones that got added but are not reclinable. Great on multiple show timing.   Only problem I ever had was four obnoxious girls and one of them throwing her chips at the end of the movie to the back row.<//Review>< Pics>

At first the background music overlapped the sound of the trailers, but they were quick to fix it once they were informed of the problem. They need a better way to serve the popcorn refill than using 2 food trays!</review>

Very deceptive place. New lighting outside and plenty of parking, but once inside you get a feeling of the actual old structure.
Small bathrooms, moldy carpet and literally run down seats where you can feel the springs under. Horrible!</review>

<review>The lobby may look all grand and spacious but once you head into their auditorium, that’s when the problems arise. Firstly, this is one ghetto place. I can see it being profitable for people with budget constraints and don’t care about picture quality and sound, but since I’m not that kind of person and I do care a whole heck of a lot about picture and sound quality, I can say this...is subpar. It is old and it shows from the ratty looking floor to the moldy, unwashed seats, to the inept sound and picture. Watched Pacific Rim Uprising here and just the lighting from the projector wasn’t crystal clear. Im not expecting some IMAX/Dolby kinda place but I do expect that when scenes shot in the dark you can still see what’s going on. Anyways, not a great place, but if you don’t care about cleanliness or picture and aound quality, then be my guest: go here. If you’re like me, try AMC.<//review>< pictures>

Ticket prices are good and they have lower prices before 4pm and/or with school I.D. The food/popcorn, candy, etc are a bit high on price. I've seen them check people's bags for FOOD which is kind of weird and a private matter to me. It's clean for the most part.
They DO need better or just new seats because they're old and uncomfortable almost all the time. I can't seem to find a good seat anymore. The bathrooms are clean, customer service is good and they have a huge parking structure.< /review>< pics>

Usually have a good experience, but this morning was wack. Online advertisement and brochure read 1015am start time for COCO this morning At 630am. Get there, kids excited, I'm excited for them, go to pay and that time slot no longer available. My kid are in the car in tears now. Cashier came back kind of hard when I told her that the advertisement says different. No apology, just a nasty attitude. Wack.</text>

I give regency theatre a one star because the new Amy Schumer movie sucked and I lost my popcorn in the girls bathroom and I went back to get it and it was in the trash can. I aslo would have like to see more death, mostly Amy Schumer. I would have rated 0 but one is my favorite number, cuz I'm number one.....wooooooooooooooooo</text>

Love this little tiny theatre in heart of Van Nuys. Had an awesome time watching the kick ass girl flick Proud Mary and enjoy my large popcorn with free refills for $7.50 and hot dogs for a buck. Yes one buck.< /text>

<text>Please keep in mind that I am new and from the Midwest/east coast...I thought the price of the ticket was fairly normal. Then we got into the theatre...every single seat (even the premium ones) were DISGUSTING. I have never seen a theatre so dirty. It was so bad my cousin and I didn't even want to sit down after searching the entire theatre for a clean seat. We found only one seat that was passible. I believe it was clean because it was the seat next to wheelchair seating and no one sits alone at the theatre. This place would get 1 start but I'm giving it two because they agreed to give me a refund.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

It is inappropriate behavior that the management can't do anything about, I know, but I have not been to any other theater in this city that is this bad.  I like the prices at this theatre, but I am willing to pay more rather than to listen to another person's child crying or talking through dialog, when my children are at home with a babysitter.<//Text>< Pictures>

I love the DBox seating in this theater. It is certainly an improvement from when the other theater was in its place then regency bought it out. They have good matinee prices. $1.50 hotdogs (even though they were a dollar before) hopefully they don't start raising their prices. It's a decent theater for being in the area. I think what stands out in this theater are the DBox seats which have moving chairs that go along with the action of the movie. It'll do.<//Text>

It is really hard for me to rate a theatre. See I basically live in the movies. I go to alot of different venues and see alot of different movies. The plant has its own charm. Now like most things charm doesnt mean it is good or bad, it means it is its own. When you pull up you are greeted by nothing special other than the police station next door. (AT least you feel safe?) When you go in, a slightyly dingy but overall clean lobby awaits you. The "We dont you" entrance where they check all bags  etc leads into a concession area with the screens on either side.

The screens themselves are in okay shape. They are older and so is the seating. You don't come here for comfort you come here for the fair price movies. 10 bucks is a "good" deal now days.

If you want to see a movie in passable quality make sure to head to the plant to save some money!!<//text>

Can't believe what I just saw,We were in a theatre watching "how to train your dragon" with the kiddos.  Some guy (dont know name, just know he was african american) stands up shouting at a man behind him about how he is...

"fat assh---", shouldn't be at a kids movie, he has no right to tell him how to watch his kids and so what if his kid is jumping on chairs in a completely different row from where they were sitting (happened to be next to this guy).  People next to me were "shhhing" this man for his kids being loud and the guy took it out on this innocent other.

The best part is when I went to the bathroom, the 2 were talking to the manager it seemed like and the manager did nothing about it.

I can tell you for one, it ruined our movie, because this guys kids just kept going and he didnt care.  Not sure what happened to the other guy, hopefully he got his money back.

This theatre has always lacked descent management, but this was too much....I think next time we will go over to Van Nuys, or Burbank.  Certainly the family should have been asked to leave.  If my kids were doing this, I would leave just out of embarrassement.< /Review>< pics>

<rate>2</rate><text>Hello!
Please keep in mind that I am new and from the Midwest/east coast. I'm unsure of the culture concerning movie theaters here. I thought the price of the ticket was normal. I was particularly thankful for the student price. When we entered the theater, the first thing we saw was popcorn all over the place. This made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I knew there was a reason the ticket prices didn't match my perception of LA. Every single seat (even the premium ones) were DISGUSTING. It was dark and I could still see the dirt. I thought maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me. I pulled out my phone light and my eyes were right. It was bad. I have never seen a theatre so dirty. On the other hand, I take that kind of thing for granted living in suburban environments in my teens. This was another level though. It was so bad my cousin and I didn't even want to sit down after searching the entire theatre for a clean seat. We found only one seat that was passible. I believe it was clean because it was the seat next to wheelchair seating and no one sits alone at the theatre. This place would get 1 start (for the price) but I'm giving it two because they agreed to give me a refund. If you're hard up on options for affordable moving going this place is for you but you might want to bring your own snacks cause if this is how they handle their seats I do not want the food they prepare in my body. You might die.< /text>< Pics>

The seats in theater 15 are HORRIBLE..I actually felt a spring thru my whole movie.. My wife was scared to sit down for the movie.. thus was so disgusting.. I will never come back here again. I only stayed because my kids were wanted to watch the movie.< /Review>

This place used to be a scary dump.  The new manager,  Chris, really shaped up the service.  No Regency Theater is run as well as this one!</Review>
