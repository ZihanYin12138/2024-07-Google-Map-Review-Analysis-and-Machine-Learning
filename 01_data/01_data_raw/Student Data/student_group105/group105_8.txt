It's pre-cooked pizza that's warmed for you while you wait. Pizza was ok, I knew what I was getting into.< /review>

I’m from Boston and I miss the east coast dearly. But Brooklyn Pizzeria pizza is the closest when it comes to tasting East cost pizza! If you’ve never been, you must try a slice or two! I love garlic and they make garlic knots covered with fresh garlic! It smells as good as it taste! The owner and staff are very friendly too.</Text>

Easy location to find. I like the simplicity of the menu. I had a burger with a side of potato salad. The burger was good, flavorful, and hearty. The potato salad did not taste homemade, but rather commercial made. The staff was nice and friendly. I will come back.< /Text>

Pizza is pretty good. Twice I tried ordering something from the menu other than pizza and don't have it.  Not even spaghetti or salad and when asking the employee they rudely respond and the point to the pizza in the table. A shame because the chicken parmigiana anda spaghetti was very good< /Text>

From the outside you wouldn't expect a good place, but it turns out the pizza is pretty good here. It's kinda cramped inside, but there's indoor and outdoor seating. Pricing is fine, there's a good selection of slices, but you can also get sandwiches or salads or pasta. I opted for the margherita and the spinach/ricotta...both were good, I wish they were a little warmer, but there was flavor, sufficient toppings, and the crust was crispy and chewy.</Review>

We placed an online order for an associate's birthday at our office downtown Friday, Oct. 25th.  A Brooklyn Pizzeria downtown was the Birthday Girl's choice as she is a vegetarian.  These comments are not meant for A Brooklyn Pizzeria directly.  They are to caution any customer who chooses to order online.  After the order did not arrive on time, we contacted the restaurant to check on the status of our order.  A Brooklyn Pizzeria never received our order.  After researching the situation, we learned their online ordering is handled by "Menu Star Food Ordering" not Grub Hub as advertised. Beware restaurants and customers.  There is no connection from this company to the restaurants they represent for online delivering.  We reordered by telephone directly through A Brooklyn Pizzeria.  Our order arrived in a timely manner.  Even though an 1/2 hour late, the Birthday gathering did happen and the food was great.  However, Menu Star Food Ordering had made one attempt to be paid but it did not go through my associate's credit card.  The bottom line, A Brooklyn Pizzeria's staff and food are authentic.  Don't trust the online ordering process.  Beware of Menu Star Food Ordering !!</text>

Good pizza slice variety. $7.50 gets you two slices and a drink. Won't go to City Pizzeria anymore because of their Gary Kreep support. This spot is pretty good though.< /Review>

This is the best new york style pizza in the city. They always have a huge selection of pizza slices and they are delicious. The place gets a lot of traffic but never has huge lines. It's quick and easy. The bathroom is a little outdated and they sometimes run out of drinks in the coolers. The pizza makes up or all of that. Highly recommended. I don't give 5 star ratings out very often.</review>

<review>One doesn't come by New York pizza often in San Diego but this joint has it all. Foldable, tomatoey, cheesy and well spiced slices that will keep you coming back. The place is quite small but there is a good chance that you will find yourself at home enjoying great italo-american food.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

New york style pizza.  Good prices.   If you like thin brick oven this is your place.  5 minute walk from Sofia hotel where we stayed.   Good helping on Greek salad as well.<//Text>

Pizza was great, service was bad and the math was worse. I would like to ask everyone what is 20% of $8 if your answer is 20 cents then you probably work at Brooklyn pizzeria and have been since elementary because you damn sure didn't make it to middle school. For context I politely asked if they did military discount and the worker felt it necessary to give me a math lesson and saying if I really need 20 cents he can give it to me from his pocket. I smiled and declined, then when my order was ready he deemed it necessary to say hey bring this over to your boyfriend. He did this several times. It's ridiculous he can get away with that in what I assume is a popular establishment.< /Text>

Hour and a half later (by the way the hotel I was at was 2 minutes walking  distance) the food shows up cold and burnt! Furious  I called and all I got was " I'm sorry".

<text>Wow... The cook/chef was nice enough to bring out fresh pepperoni pizza since I ordered the two slice deal. He then got some nice 3-4 hour old slice for me. My sister got the Margharita pizza that was bland with no taste but it looked fresh. Best part was the knots wait he sold out of those but the ones behind him waiting to be cooked where not available. Soda was flat without taste. Overall two stars since at least the pizza was warm.</text></record>

<Text>I have no freaking idea what I had, but I had to make a decision and grabbed two different slices of pizza really fast because the line was moving along.  It was f**ing bomb.  I would say the best tasting in San Diego.  The pizza huts - shmuts is a welfare case compared to this place.

<review>Good flavor with good daily deals.  Met the owner, treated the employees unfairly.  Concerning labor illegality.  They got no breaks, worked extra hours without pay.  Takes taxes out, but does not pay employees, taxes.  So the employees do not file because the owner keeps the funds he with holds.  I interview three employees.< /review>< Rating>

It's not safe to eat there late at night.  The owner started yelling at me after I tried to use my debit card for an under $10 purchase.  I told him he needed to be nicer to customers and that he's not running his business appropriately.  Meanwhile he was making eye contact with the young men hanging out behind me.  I told him to keep the slice of pizza.  On the way out his patrons jumped me and stole my belongings.</text>

<Text>My pizza was so horrible. Very greasy and hard to digest. Needed to soak the excess grease of of my pizza before I took a bite. Also the manager or owner didn't seem concerned about the quality or first experience. The tables and chairs need to be updated or at least repaired. The self serve soda fountain was awkward in it's setup. Didn't look clean and my soda didn't taste right. Not going back ever< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I think I could say this is the most disappointing pizza I have ever had. A groupon took me there and I will not give it a second chance. The ready to serve pizzas had flys buzzing around so I had to order a whole pie. It took care of my hunger but thats it.< /Text><GmapID>0x80d954a7c664ed1b:0xd0038afda1a8fe2a</GmapID></record>

DISGUSTING PIZZA !
DO NOT ORDER IT ! WASTING MONEY !
(today i decided to try this place and was disgusted when i found hair in my pizza), then i went online an read a review about them , OMG this place is total mess,they need to shut down this place.
ITS CHEAP FOR A REASON. I RATHER GO BETTER PLACE  AND SPEND 1 $ MORE, BUT NOT TO HAVE HAIR IN MY FOOD!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Stop by on the way to the trolley. I ate two pieces of delicious pizza, the richest pizza I have eaten in a long time. The one who attended me, I don't know if it was the owner, he was super friendly and fast. I came out in 5 minutes with delicious pizza heated in a lenha oven. I would definitely come to eat a pizza with my family, it sure is better. If you want something good, nice and cheap (the holy bbb), and fast and of good quality while you are walking downtown, come here.

pase por aqui en camino al trolley. me comi dos pedazos de pizza riquisimos, de la pizza mas rica que he comido en mucho tiempo. el que me atendio, no se si era el duenho, fue super amable y rapido. sali en 5 minutos con deliciosa pizza calentada en horno de lenha. definitivamente vendria a comer una pizza con mi familia, seguro esta mejor. Si quieren algo bueno bonito y barato(la sagrada bbb), y rapido y de buena calidad mientras estan paseando en downtown, vengan aqui.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Pizzeria in downtown San Diego, Brooklyn style; good taste and good quality of food. I liked that the dough is made the place and the base of the pizza is thin. Excellent flavor, in addition the restaurant is personally attended by the owner and by very friendly staff.

Pizzería en el centro de San Diego, al estilo Brooklyn; buen sabor y buena calidad de los alimentos. Me gustó que la masa es hecha el lugar y la base de la pizza es delgada. Excelente sabor, además el restaurante es atendido personalmente por el dueño y por personal muy amable.< /text>

I love this gym (Results Transformation Center). I have been a member for almost 6 years. Coaches are great, very helpful and knowledgeable. All the members are nice and it is like a big family, everyone motivate and inspire each other.

Sometimes it's about the journey, not the destination that matters. The last 6 weeks, I have gotten back to eating healthy, working out almost every morning, finding a protein drink I actually love (they really do exist!), and building a community of support for my health goals. Most importantly, I am celebrating and laughing at myself (No, Marcia, your hips need to go backwards!) as I realize my real goal was  to find a place where I would be encouraged every day to keep trying. Thanks to my coaches and friends I have made, this is only the beginning. Great workouts, great people, and great Fit Fam! Thanks, Results!!<//text>

They make it a point to have you feel part of the team.
The workouts are always challenging, always different, never boring, and super fun! It helps that the coaches walk around and truly watch every member to make sure they are using proper form. Oh and they will always give you an alternative move if you have limits or mobility issues. They really do care about their members!

Love the varieties of workouts, my fave is Tabata Tuesdays. I love the way Results Fitfam is a no judgement environment and fosters unity among members. Coaches Curtis and Stacie are  the best at challenging and helping me stay accountable in reaching goals and focusing on those “non scale victories”. My membership is an investment in me and RTC is a great value. Love my Fitfam!!! 💪🏻❤️<//Text>

I never knew I would enjoy a 5am workout so much! I used to oversleep for work now I get up at 4am to workout. This was one of the best decisions I made for myself and my family. I have gained energy, endurance, and feel great! It has been a pleasure to work with such knowledgeable, friendly and no nonsense people. All of the coaches truly care that you in the group of 40-50 people are getting your best work out so you can get the best benefit. I have truly enjoyed this experience! Thank you so much Results Sunrise!</review>

<text>I just completed my 6 week 20lb challenge and beat it by losing 21.4lbs! So happy with my victory I joined as a member immediately after with no question. This is not your typical gym, which I've tried them all, it's a new lifestyle support system. I always struggled being motivated in continuously going to the gym. The initial investment was a great incentive to try get back and basically get 6 weeks of training, meal planning and support for free! Yes concur the challenge and get all your money back. I ended up getting the 6 weeks for free and now have become a member because it is worth every penny. The coaches are the best, they are very attentive to challengers and members. The challengers and members themselves are all so positive and encourage each other. Everyone eventually gets to know one another over time because we all have the same purpose. This is a place to get results, that no other gym will give you. I've seen all the challengers and myself get stronger and skinnier within the last 6 weeks. I'm extremely happy to continue my journey to get even stronger and leaner. Good luck to you and you won't regret joining, it just might be the best investment for yourself.<//text>< pics>

But Results Transformation Center  is all and beyond what  everyone says and what I was expecting. I am so glad I found them and now belong to this gym and the fit fam.

<Review>Round 2 :
I lost a total of 6 lbs this challenge. I was not able to make my 20 lbs but I have gained lot of confidence and have become very strong. I have toned down my body and have lost lot of inches. I have lot of non scale victories like I am able to fit better in my old clothes which were just lying in my closet as they had stopped fitting me. I can walk run now. I can lift very heavy and workout all 7 days without getting tired. I am definitely going to be a member of results as results have really made all that money and effort worth it.

Round1
This is the best gym I have ever seen. The coaches are super friendly and they always push you to do your best. They understand and are always ready to answer any questions. Everyday the only thing I look forward to is going to the gym at 4.30 pm, and then wait again for the next day. Its super fun with a lot of high intensity exercises. They make you do things you never thought you'll ever be able to do.
Thanks results team for making it possible for me to lose 20.4 lbs in 6 weeks. I am totally in it and all ready to lose another 20 and get fitter each and every day.

All the coaches are great but my favorite is coach Curtis. No excuses is his approach and I'm doing moves I never thought I would be able to do.
This is where they failed.
After my challenge I was given an option to become a member which I would love to become, but It wasn't the offer that my sister was given after her challenge she had just completed. I was told that if I lost 20 lbs my payment would roll over to pay the monthly installments of 99 per month. Hopefully they will be able to offer me the same as my sister received.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>When I walked into Results Transformation Sunrise I had no idea what to expect. I was greeted by Coach Will with a high five and a great, energetic attitude. That scared me even more! The first workout was HARD, as was every workout after that. However, as I went in each day, dreading it when I left work, when I walked in to workout I remembered I was with friends and the staff made it feel like home.

Coach Will, Coach Curtis, Coach Randy and Coach John kicked my butt every single day, but it was worth every second.

<review>Results Transformation Center has some of the best personal trainers that I have come in contact with. Even throughout my military career I have not come across anyone in fitness as motivating as the coaches at Results. I think the quality of the gym is good and the workouts are great and never boring. You will see results as long as you stay consistent and stick to the plan they have designed for you. Results is awesome and I would recommend Results to friends and family and in fact I already have and I hope to see some of them in the gym with me soon.<//review></record></dataset><record>
<date>1456206633680<//date><review>My wife asked me to accompany her to an orientation for Results. As I sat and listened to Matt talk, I knew it was time for change. All my questions were answered and I signed on the dotted line. I really had no idea what I was in store for but figured I didn't have anything to lose.

What I found when I walked into Results was an extremely attentive group of coaches. I explained to them the limitations I had with my lower back and not only did they take the time to show me different modifications they helped show me how to stretch and target my problem areas.

As I got stronger my daily workouts were modified specifically for me. Heavier weights were added and my coaches always made sure I was pushing myself hard in order to obtain the goals I had set.  When I had questions about meal planing my coach was never farther than an email away.

I am extremely happy with my journey at Results. Because of their program and my hard work I completed my challenge successfully. Yes, I could take my money and run but instead I signed up as a member. This program works!< /review>< rating>

I was greeted by Coach Will with a high five and a great, energetic attitude. That scared me even more! The first workout was HARD, as was every workout after that. However, as I went in each day, dreading it when I left work, when I walked in to workout I remembered I was with friends and the staff made it feel like home.

Coach Will, Coach Curtis, Coach Randy and Coach John kicked my butt every single day, but it was worth every second.

<pics>None</pics><Review>I joined this gym January 11, 2016.  Nervous, energized and curious.  Today I finished a 6 week challenge and the journey to my weight loss was incredible! I lost 22.2 pounds!
The coaches at Sunrise are fantastic. They teach, push, motivate, assist and coach.  The group exercise classes are incredible.  Not only do they give us exercises in a way that is fun, hard, and self challenging, but you get split up into smaller groups, and we cheer each other on to completion.  The nutrition was easy to follow. They give you a complete list, and just stick to it!  They say Nutrition is 70-80% success for a weight loss program, and I believe it to be true, but the work outs are body changing.  Modifications are available for any fitness level.  When my challenge came to an end, I went to the supermarket to get good, and found myself only buying things off the list.  This was and is a life changing event, which I encourage EVERYONE to participate in!< /Review><user_name>Tracey Valentine<//user_name><gmapID>0x809add606d8ddf69:0xa7c811a319792beb< /gmapID><user_id>103999353434939170796<//user_id><time>1456204098747<//time>< response>

The atmosphere of the gym is unlike anything I have experienced in the past. The coaches, Will, Curtis, Stacey, John and Randy are the best! I took a 6 week challenge and was able to lose 26lbs in that time and honestly love going to the gym and seeing all of the positive and upbeat members each day. The results are real. You just have to put in the work.<//review>

The coaches are helpful and encouraging, the other challengers are in the same boat and working hard while encouraging others.  Everyone is friendly and helpful, there is no way i could have done this without their support.  Results is the best investment you can make in your health and fitness.< /text>< Pictures>

I just completed my second 6 week challenge with Results Transformation Center at the Sunrise location and what can I say:  Another 20 lbs and overall, in thirteen weeks, close to 55 lbs.  I started at an extremely ugly 265 fat, lousy, pounds and now I am pushing 210.  My goal is 190 but I'm pretty sure I should be able to continue on to maybe 180!

I have to be honest, it was a struggle, this last challenge.  The weight was not coming off as fast as the first challenge, which I guess is to be expected, but....who the f^^k cares, I did it, and with that said, even turned my success into a membership for the next year.  This is the best deal -- if you don't mind the coaches (Lea, John, Curtis, Aj, Consuela and the rest) yelling at you, motivating you, pushing you to do things that you haven't done in a very long time.

And we (members, challengers) all share pretty much of same goals, have fun, sweat, and look better.  Thank God, Costco's got cheap pants, because, it looks like I'll be downsizing a bit during this next year.  I started wearing a size 40 stretch pants with no belt -- now 38's are too lose with the belt tightened all the way.

As far as the menu goes, the food is what it is -- better for me.  Turkey, lean beef, fish, veggies all the way, protein shakes and the works, and I'm never hungry.

Who knows how far I'll go, but I do have a few goals -- 1) Matt, if ever need a speaker at one of your presentations, I'm volunteering, and 2) I want my beast mode, and 3) my picture on the wall at Sunrise!

Finally -- To all at Sunrise, Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!</Text>

<text>It is my absolute pleasure to write my testimonial for Results!  I will freely admit that I was skeptical about their claims of loosing 20 lbs in 6 weeks.  Sure, young people could do it, but I am 45 and everything I’ve read says it’s so hard to lose weight after 40.  However, I was exhausted all the time, my clothes didn’t fit, and my blood pressure was rising higher and higher.  I figured “what the heck, anything is better than what I was doing,” and the 42 days was going to pass by whether I chose to help my self or not.  So I bit the bullet and signed up.

In the beginning I was so uncoordinated and nervous, but now I’m able to hold a plank, do many push-ups in a row, and I generally feel great!  Learning to eat according to the plan was challenging at first, but I found that my will is stronger than my stomach and after a week or so it was easy to stick to the food plan (STTFP).  Plus, everyone was so friendly at the gym that I was happy and excited to go everyday.

Thanks to the amazing coaches at Results and the plan they have put together, anyone can succeed if they just follow the simple directions.  This program has changed my life.  Give it a chance to change your life too.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809add606d8ddf69:0xa7c811a319792beb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This review is long over due . I signed up in 2019 and I completed the 6 week challenge . I didn’t win the money because I only lost 11 lbs which was a lot of weight to loose , but the catch is you have to have a lot of fat to loose (no offense). I was really happy with my results I decided to sign up for a contract , which was $777 for 7 months . This was great at the time because I enjoyed the staff , facility and workouts . Soon I realized this gym is meant for people who work 9-5 or unemployed people. Not meant for college students who have inconsistent schedules . My issue was trying to get there at the times they have their classes I believe their first class was 5:00am and last was 9 or 10 . Then no classes til 5:00pm. I am still a full time student plus work 25+ hours a week. Once school started I had no time due to early classes and late night shifts . I was disappointed in myself for paying a contract that I couldn’t fully complete . That was my lost . The issue began once I noticed they had been charging my card after the contract was over . My contract was suppose to be over December 2019. They continued to take payments Jan, feb and March. I called to talk to Will to fix that . He explained that i supposedly agreed to a renewal after my contract , which I did not . He tells me he will take March off and not the other months . Mind you this is $135 they are taking a month. He sends me my copy of my contract for me to only find out he illegally added the renewal with out my consent . Meaning when I signed up I signed the document on the initial agreement and then he slipped in the renewal. Make sure you are aware and you don’t get scammed because I thought they cared about me and hr shortly showed me that all they care about is the money and how to get over on you . This place is good if u need a personal trainer , but that’s it . It’s not a gym with a bunch of equipment that is easy to use on your own time . You might as well workout at home .<//Review>< pics>

I just took the 20lb challenge with Results. Although I didn't make it to the 20 lbs. I did loose weight and inches. I enjoyed the atmosphere at the gym, the coaches, and the members. Everyone was great! I can say that I have learned a lot through the process as far as diet and exercise. I have stayed on as a member because I enjoy the workouts so much. They kick my butt every time I show up. I would recommend Results to anyone who is looking for a change in themselves. Regardless of whether or not you need to loose a lot of weight or if you are just looking for a place to workout, meet great people and become more physically fit! So happy I signed up and can't wait to get to my goal! I know I will with the help of Results!< /text>

<review>I am someone who REALLY, really likes to research things before I do them.  Results was no different.  I went to two orientations prior to enrolling, and my only regret is that I didn't sign up sooner.  I hesitated time and time again, but eventually it became clear that nothing else was working--it was time to do it, and I am so beyond glad that I did.  Let me clarify, I am not one of those people who looooves eating healthy and can't wait to go to the gym.  I am more of a skip on my way to the fridge type of girl and call it a day.  Results, however, is changing all of that.  I am beginning to see food as fuel, not as an emotional crutch.  My favorite part of the program is the workouts.  They are HARD, but I love it.  One of the best parts of the workouts is that I have NEVER, ever felt anything close to judged.  It is regular to give each other high fives, hear words of encouragement from teammates, and get cheered on by your coaches.  I lost 23 lbs during my first 6 week challenge.  I am beginning my second, and am so happy to have found Results.</review><name>Kelly Sarah<//name>< GmapID>

I just can't say enough about Results Transformation Center. Thanks to the coaches, I have lost a total of 37.6 pounds in the two challenges that I participated in. I have also gone from a size 14 to a size 8. And most important, I feel stronger and healthier than I have in a long time. They have helped me gain my confidence back.

It's not just the coaches; it is everyone at the gym. The entire fit fam is so supportive and non-judgmental; I couldn't see myself going anywhere else.

It's hard work, but it is so worth the Results! I recommend this gym to anyone who is looking for a place to fit in, who wants support and advice from real coaches, and who just is looking to change their lives.

I checked out other gyms, but none of them had the same feel that Results does. It truly is an amazing gym!< /text>

I just completed my Final weigh in and lost a total of 32 Lbs!! My BMI and body fat % were fantastic as well! After the 1st workout I wanted out after 3 knee surgeries and heading towards knee replacement I thought there's no way my knees are going to hold up, I talked to Coach Curtis the following workout and he modified my workouts perfectly to match my body, I was Red Lighted on shoulders as well and the modifications were perfect, I have much more mobility in my knees and shoulders than I've had in years and my Energy Level is through the roof, I can't give enough props to the entire Results Crew, they were all accessible and helpful every step of the way, look forward to a great boating season where I won't be embarrassed to take off my shirt!.

<Text>100% recommend this gym for anyone who is committed to get RESULTS. The workouts have modifications available so any level can benefit. The diet is easy to understand and follow. As long as you make your workouts and STTFP you WILL succeed! The coaches are supportive and helpful, encouraging every step of the way, I never once just felt like a member, I felt like part of the RESULTS FAMILY.

Results Transformation Center is the best place to transform yourself. The coaches are motivating and the workouts are challenging, fun, and energizing. After working out and sticking to the meal plan, I feel stronger, healthier, and have learned self discipline to accomplish the goals I set for myself. I truly feel grateful for the Results team at the Sunrise location for all the support and motivation to help me make these lifestyle changes and stick with them.  Thank you!<//review>

<Date>1460558654650< /Date><review>I had reached a stand still in my weight loss journey before doing the Results 6 week 20 lb challenge. The coaches here are absolutely phenomenal they make you feel like they are  your personal trainer, they got me so excited to come in 5 days a week to exercise that I actually would have wanted to come in seven days a week except for I know my body needs to rest. They pushed me to always do my best and to work towards getting even stronger.  I am a returning Challenger going into round 2 since I lost 27.4 pounds in my first round! I can't say for sure that I would ever have lost that much weight in 6 weeks on my own without the help of results Transformation Center!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I'm an alumni challenger who came from the Arden/Howe gym. While I was a tad bit skeptical and loyal to my original "home gym," this place kicks ass!!! They are uber professional and require that you bring your game in a healthy way. They challenge you while being careful that every exercise is being executed correctly. There's a great balance going on here and I'm grateful to have found such an awesome place to work out. One hour a day and the results you get?? Priceless!! Good job team Sunrise!</text>< Rating>

Terrific place ! I always fascinated being fast and strong to play the different sports I love, but lacked the motivation to do the hard work involved. Results motivated me and drove me to a new level of fitness which I never had before. I feel like I am back on track and pumped to loose weight the right way.

I'm happy to say that I completed the six week challenge and lost 20.6 lbs.  It was definitely hard but worth it.  It's not just about the weight loss.  Sure that's a huge factor but for me it's also about the people you meet there and the strength you gain both inside and out.  You really can push yourself more than you think.  The coaches are so nice at Sunrise and they help motivate you.  Thats what I needed.  So I'm on to my next challenge.  :)< /Review>

Just completed the famous 6 week 20lbs challenge and this gym is the bomb!!! I lost 23 pounds in 6 weeks , yep that's right 6 short weeks I lost that much! It's no fad diet nor gimmicks, just hard work, dedication and a very supportive and friendly staff to help you along the way! If you are looking for a place to motivate you and help kickstart your fitness look no more! Any other gym Is a waste of time and money! Invest in yourself and choose the best!<//text>

After completing 4 rounds of the 6 Week Challenge, I guess I should be sick of the program, but I’m far from it!  Even after losing 69.2 lbs since January, I still have goals to reach, and I know that the only place in town that will get me there is Results.  I love the trainers and the program is easy to follow.  Anyone that needs a kick start should come here.  I am looking forward to this next phase as a member, and to helping new challengers coming in.  We are a fit family here, and I’m in it for the long haul.  I recommend this program to anyone because anyone can achieve success for whatever their specific goals are.  I only wish I had joined sooner!< /review>

I am very proud to say that I successfully completed the first 6 week challenge with a loss of 23.6 lbs. I will be going on the second 6 weeks. I had a rough start in the first couple weeks because I didn't (STTFP) but once I did the weight started to come off fast. The coaches are awesome at Sunrise Results Transformation Center. On my first day I thought I was going to die from the exercise and I almost wanted to give up, but the coaches and few others that i was working out with kept saying you can do it!!! So I kept pushing and I kept going day after day and then I started to see changes in my body, My aches and pains from the weight I was carrying started to go away. I was able to fit into a few pair of my old jeans that had been in my closet for years... I am now able to bend over and tie my shoes without any problem. I have more energy than I have had in years. I can honestly say that starting the challenge is the best decision I have made for 2016 and I plan to lose even more in the second round. Results Transformation Center is definitely the place to be!!!< /review>

<review>Results was exactly what I needed to get my weight loss jump started. I had been trying on my own with not much progress. I completed the 20 lb challenge and I’m so glad I did, I dropped 21.8 lbs a few months before my wedding. (I went from 168.6 to 146.8) The eating was definitely the hardest part, but committing to the challenge was the motivation I needed to just do it and stop making excuses. The workouts were great and the trainers are so positive and supportive, but they also know when to tell you to pick up the pace and challenge you to push yourself. Believe it or not I did enjoy going there and met a lot of good people during my 6 weeks.< /review>< Rate>

My experience at Results Transformation Center Sunrise was incredible. I came in to this 6 week challenge in a horrible state. I had not really exercised in 8 years due to injuries and complications from 2 head-on collisions in 5 years. Once I had my doctor's ok to exercise (with modifications), I decided I should go all out to get back in the game. What I love about Results is they work with you as an individual. They can modify your workout so that you get the most out of it without hurting yourself. This was one of my big issues. My worries were quickly relieved when I was given a thorough screening. I am now doing things I never, ever imagined I would do! This has been a life changing experience and I am so grateful!<//Review>

I realize more and more with each day and each empowering workout how much Results has impacted my life in a positive way. I feel better about my body's abilities as well as my physical appearance. I feel welcomed by the coaches and staff every time I walk in, and by the other members or challengers who I meet, that understand what I'm going through more than anyone else in some ways. When I have had a lousy day and all I want to do is go home and get in to bed to forget about it, I choose instead to go to Results where it never fails to put a smile on my face by the time I leave. Almost every day I am there I realize new strengths or push myself to new limits. I think everyone needs to experience it in the life-changing way that I did, but you will never know unless you give Results a chance, and also believe in yourself!! If you are tired of the habits you have formed in your daily life, or the clothes that you keep saving but can never lose weight to fit in to, then you NEED to come to Results; it will be the best decision you ever made!!!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I just finished my second challenge and have lost 44 pounds total. After 12 weeks, I am getting my money back and putting it right back into a membership at Results. I am in the best shape i've been in since playing lacrosse in college, all my old clothes from college fit, and I am confident and happy. I look forward to every workout and to getting stronger with the help of the coaches at Results. I was skeptical to start and after I finished my first challenge my mind was changed, but I didn't think I would be able to make the second challenge. I was able to push myself and be pushed by the coaches and others at the gym and succeeded beyond what I could have imagined. This is a 5 star program that will change your life if you put the work in and let it.<//Review>< pics>

I'm going into my second challenge and will most likely do a third. I really needed to kick myself into gear but didn't have the right motivation until I came across them via Facebook Ad in September. I'm so glad I attended the initial orientation, they motivate you to get the results you both strive for.
I am running the Philadelphia marathon in November and needed to start working out again to get prepared while also running 5/10K's events. I have done (2) 5K's this challenge and I'm right on track thanks to Results Transformation Center's. I've created a year calendar on my Mac that has all races until 2017, I'm making goals and turning them into actual plans!
The best part is they do it in a timely manner.  6 weeks to lose 20lbs? Yes please! I've been holding on to this extra weight the past two years and it is time to get rid of it for good.The plan they have really makes the weight come right off, STICK TO THE PLAN!
I tell all my friends and family about this place, they ask me and I love talking about it! It's my favorite place to go to in the mornings, it truly energizes me for my day. I can't image starting my day without working out. The staff is amazing, I love the workouts. The atmosphere is welcoming and inspiring, the coaches are great. You are forced to create healthy habits for yourself, I couldn't be more happy with my results... on to the next one!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I just completed my second 6wk challenge with Results with a total weight loss of 41.2 lbs.  I am so glad  I made the decision to invest in myself and would do it again any day of the week.  I worked my butt off, and there were times I felt like giving up but the support and encouragement from the coaches and the rest of the "transformers" is what kept me join til the end.  If you're concerned about the cost, don't be - you're worth it! !< /Text>

<text>I first heard about Results through a coworker. I noticed she was looking amazing and her confidence level was crazy high. My sister went to an orientation and I heard about expensive it was and thought no way could I afford that. I thought about it for weeks and weeks. I have never really struggled with my weight. I have always been lucky enough to stay active and eat whatever I wanted. It was until I had a deep loss within my family, my brother passed away suddenly, and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, that made me go into a depression and use food as a comfort. I was drinking alcohol all the time and eating whatever I could get my hands on to make me forget about reality. I gained over 60lbs in just a short time. I stopped going out, stopped doing the things I loved. I had such a fake confidence that no one even believed me when I self I was very self-conscious.  I was really good at faking the smile. I remembered all of this and started telling myself this is not how my brother would want me to live my life. He would be so mad at me if he was here. So now for the happy part. I decided to work overtime at my job and sign up for Results with my sister. She went to an orientation with me and sat through it again. After hearing Matt speak I left there feeling like I could conquer the world with Results. The first day I was so scared and felt very self-conscious. My sister was with me so I knew I wasn’t alone in my feelings. I remember walking in and see Jayme’s smiling face and I thought ok she looks nice maybe this won’t be that bad. The coaches that day were amazing and very welcoming. They took the time to show us modifications for the movements that we couldn’t quite do yet and did not make us feel bad about it. The next few weeks got easier and we started making friends with other members and having jokes with our coaches. The meal prepping became easier and eventually became routine. I found myself sad on my rest days because I wanted to go to the gym. Being at the gym is such a positive, motivating and inspirational experience. It’s not just about the workouts or the meal prep, it’s the support that you get at Results. I feel like I have made the best decision of my life and I am never looking back. In my first six weeks I lost 22lbs and dropped two sizes in my clothes. My friends and family are saying how awesome I look and can tell my real confidence is coming back. I am running and being more active than I was before and I am loving it. Thank you so much to all the Coaches at Sunrise Results. SUNRISE….RISE UP!!<//text><date>1460603168803<//date>< Pictures>

I just finished my 6 week challenge at Results. I lost 23 pounds, i'm super excited about it and of course i couldn't have done it without the help of an amazing FitFam team and coaches. The coaches are fabulous! They will push, motivate and help you to succeed. This program is REAL and so are the results... take a step now for a better future! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻<//text>

<Review>I was skeptical at first and was nervouse at the same time when I decided to take on their 20lbs Challenge.  First few sessions were hard and something that I was still getting used to, but as time went on, it was more enjoyable.  The group work out sessions and the support of their coaches inspired and pushed me more to try harder and succeed.  The supportive atmosphere is hard to find in ANY gym, but it is present here.  When you are falling behind, there is ALWAYS someone to give you an encouraging word when you need it most.  This gym is fun, challenging, and something to SWEAT FOR!  Yes, in this gym I lost 25 lbs and I went from a border line 40 waist to a tight 36...AND THATS IN SIX WEEKS!  The prices are not cheap, but are affordable and are well worth it. You will love this place!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Time>1608595184482<//Time><rating>5< /rating><Review>I have been a member of results transformation center for several years and can’t imagine being anywhere else. These people that I workout with have become my family… my “fit fam”. I did the challenge as a member and I truly feel like it has set the tone for me going into 2021. I did all but one of my workouts from the comfort of my own home. The online (results anywhere) library is terrific and I love the live stream classes. The coaches are all great at keeping the workouts exciting and challenging too. They also offer many alternative exercise options for my troubled knee and old shoulder injury. I would recommend Results to anyone who is serious about their fitness goals. It is a fun, energetic, positive place plus they have a super supportive staff. I’ve never met anyone I did not like or was not positive and quick to offer help. The staff goes  beyond with checking in on us when we are not there (yes, they notice), helping you with setting goals as well as helping you achieve them, and always have great nutritional advice. The program doesn’t allow you to starve or waste away. It offers different options to suit what is best for your body’s needs.
Many many thanks to all the Results staff and my FitFam! 12.21.20 posted for Rancho Cordova location< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Just completed my 3rd round at results gym.  Lost another 20lbs.  Still the best decision I made for myself.  Lost over 70lbs total, dropped 3 shirt sizes since January.  Coming to this place is a daily routine now, it does not feel like a choir (some days are harder than others but still worth it!).  Thank you Jayme, Danny, JJ, Curtis and all of the other staff for making this a great place to be at and part of the fit fam.</text>

<Time>1456249019065< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>I am a return challenger.  I first took the 6 week challenge last year January 2015 and went on to complete 3 challenges then became a member.  What happened…vacation and I couldn’t get my head back into the game my fault CERTAINLY NOT a reflection of Results.  I struggled and finally said I need the accountability that the 6 week challenge provides me.  I cannot say enough how much I love Results and their coaches and my fitfam.  The coaches are tough but only because they see your potential when you don’t.  They are there to guide you thru the process and assist you in your success.  My advice to anyone who may be on the fence about a program you owe it to yourself to get the best you, what do you have to lose?    Results Transformation is the key to your success…make the decision and join the challenge you’ll never look back and you’ll be happy you did it.<//text>< pics>

I just completed the Results Transformation Center’s 6 week 20 pound Challenge and 22.8 pounds are gone! I say the pounds are “gone” because “lost” implies they can be found again and that’s not what Results is all about. The Results plan is about transformation and making a new commitment to healthy living. I don’t plan to “find” those pounds again. In fact, I’m on the path to getting rid of 20 more!

This 6 week challenge is about two things: healthy eating and working your body. The coaches give you a meal plan and ask you to work out 1 hour at least 5 days a week. It's “real food” you prepare however you want with approved ingredients and a couple of protein shakes thrown in for all the exercising. I’ve done weight loss plans before (Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers and High Protein/Low Carb Meal Replacement Foods) and haven’t been successful keeping the weight off. This plan is different because I don’t have to learn how to eat “real food” after getting to my ideal weight – I’m eating it all along the way!

The workouts are challenging but also customizable to different fitness levels. The first few sessions were hard and my body was sore but, as time went on, it became more enjoyable and I felt myself getting stronger every day. The coaches are positive and supportive. They will push you hard but will also make sure that you are exercising safely and will teach you modifications if you have any injuries. When falling behind or feeling like giving up on a certain exercise, there is always someone to give you an encouraging word.

I won't lie and tell you it's easy because nothing worth anything is ever easy.  You will be amazed by how your life changes and how you grow though. I have a new mentality about food, water and exercising. Before the challenge I drank a lot of coffee and diet soda. After the challenge, I’d prefer water (I amazed myself that I could go 6 weeks without drinking anything other than water). At the end of a stressful work day, I would have opted for putting up my feet and grabbing a glass of wine. But now I look forward to getting to the gym for a sweaty workout!

If you’re looking for a gym to wear your cute outfits and you hair and makeup is perfect, this isn’t the place for you. If you’re looking for a fun and challenging workout in a supportive environment where you’ll make good friends and watch yourself transform, come check out Results Transformation Center.<//Text>

I am now feeling more confident, energetic, and no longer that couch potato from when I first started.  I am so grateful to Results Transformation Center, the coaches, and Fitfam.  I look forward to each work out and truly feel like I am missing out if I am unable to attend.  I look forward to seeing the warm smiling faces from all aspects of the gym.  I receive so much encouragement and motivation and it really means so much to me. I can now say I am able to do full burpees and run around the building without stopping. I push myself more because of the support of surrounding fitfam that want to see me do well.  Their encouragement allows me to be encouraging to someone else, and I am so appreciative.  With them, I push myself harder, aim to do better and have loved the whole process.
I received a wonderful compliment from a coach that said if only he recorded me when I first started to now, so I can see how far I’ve come.  That really put a smile on my face because I really give it my all when I’m there.  I know I’ve come a long way and want to accomplish so much more.  I completed this challenge and look forward to crushing round number 4.  I can’t wait to see these next results, If I feel this great now, the world better watch out in 6 more weeks!!!!< /Text>< pictures>

I am getting ready to start my 5th challenge with Results and in just 6 more short weeks I will have lost 100 pounds with this Results team! I started with Results in June 2015 and I completed 3 challenges back to back. I stopped after my 3rd challenge losing 75 pounds. I decided to become a member following my 3rd challenge. After the holidays I realized I needed this program to take me all the way to the end. So I started my 4th challenge in Jan 2016 and I not only lost the holiday weight, but I am only 6 more pounds from "one"derland!! I am finally reaching goals I thought were NEVER going to happen. This is the real deal!! There is nothing tricky about this program. They give you the tools and rules, you show up and follow them and you will see RESULTS! Simple as that. Its not easy making changes but if you are ready to make a change and you want to challenge a "money back guarantee" system and you are ready to feel good again, then do it here! you have nothing to lose but unwanted weight!! Good luck and hope to see you at the Sunrise location soon!<//text>< pics>

So I just finished my second challenge and it was another success!! To be honest it was more difficult than the first challenge but if you STTFP it will work for you. I'm also excited about my Non Scale Victories (NSV). When I started twelve weeks ago a could barely hold a plank or do a burpee. Now I can knock em out no problem (sorta).

<Review>Seems like a good concept paying up front but if you lose a certain amount of weight you get your money back.  In reality be prepared to be pushed beyond your ability without the coach asking what your ability is, what your limitations are.  Be prepared to be punished if you don't put a name tag on- yep 30 burpees and this is even if you are not able to physically do one burpee on your second day in the program and you will not be told that you are required to put a name tag on every single day. You may or may not be told you can modify a push up, a plank or a burpee but be prepared that you may get reprimanded and penalized if you do modify an exercise.  No time to work up to  being able to perform a required routine, do it and do it strong or be called out and humiliated.  Are coaches told to hone in on certain people to get them to drop out.  I am thinking yes- after all then the owners get to keep the clients $400.00 without that client even taking up a position in the class.  I wondered how this gym makes money if they give back the money paid up front - at least $400.00 if you lose 20 pounds..well after spending two days- minus five minutes when I walked out- I am pretty sure I know.  I wish everyone injured or put into a medical emergency in this program would post here- and don't ever think about getting your money back or having anyone who works at this gym or is a business partner in this gym understanding any of its downfalls.  After all - they are getting rich!< /Review>< name>

<Rate>5<//Rate><user_name>Sylvia Johnson< /user_name><Text>I finally joined Results after seeing one of the moms of a kid who plays softball with my daughter coming to the games with her food and protein shakes and eating on schedule while we all scarfed down the crappy snack bar food. After a while I saw her slimming down and then the light bulb went on in my head that it was time to do what she was doing. I’ve lost weight and gained muscle before, on my own, which is one of the main reasons I didn’t join Results sooner – I kept saying to myself “When I’m ready I can do it on my own again. I don’t need to pay $500 to have someone tell me what to eat and how to exercise in order to lose weight!” But in fact, that is EXACTLY what I needed! The first week of the program I felt horrible because they make you do fitness testing to determine the exercises that you can/cannot do, for safety reasons. I am an athletic person but when I discovered that I was too out of shape to do a squat or lunge the proper way it depressed the heck out of me! I wanted to quit that night, but I remembered Matt and all the other speakers at the orientation saying, “Don’t quit, just finish the program.” So I did.

Over the course of 6 weeks I went from not being able to squat properly to being able to do a full squat holding 20 lb weights. I’ve gone from having little knowledge about the proper supplementation to use, to knowing exactly what to take before, during, and after my workouts to maximize the results. I’ve gone from a woman with very little discipline to a woman disciplined enough to prepare my meals ahead of time and eat on schedule. This program has helped me kick my sugar and caffeine addiction and to care more about what I put into my body. Since starting results my daughter, who is an athlete, is beginning to eat better and to be mindful about how she fuels her body as well. Yes I lost 24.2 pounds on my first round of the challenge, but the non-scale victories outweigh those pounds by far.

I will end by warning you, this program is NOT easy and if you’re like me you will have to deal with your abnormal emotional connection to food, which can take a toll on you. Understand that you will have to eat according to the meal plan while everyone else around you grubs on whatever they want. So at birthday parties and holidays you’ll have to bring your own food or stay home to avoid succumbing to temptation. And alcohol is out of the question! The workouts are intense and you will be pushed, in a loving but firm way, not only by the coaches but by the other challengers. You will be held accountable in this challenge, and your level of success solely depends on how hard you are willing to work both in the gym and in the kitchen. Really check in with yourself before committing to this program, if you are not ready to be focused and disciplined then this is not the program for you. But if you are ready to eat clean and train hella dirty, then join us – it’ll be the most transformative six weeks of your adult life.<//Text>< user_id>

<review>I am very proud to share how excited I am about the Results Transformation  that has occurred in my life due to this life changing Gym. In the 6 weeks that my challenge took place, I gained so much, just not weight!  I have learned to trust that my body can do so much, given the right training and support.  My 2 nephews and niece and brother have been successful and I had seen such a difference in their bodies and stamina, I decided to go to the orientation, along with Julia, my daughter. We both decided to join the challenge.  I was impressed each and every workout at the caliber of the workouts and trainers/coaches and the support of the members and other 'challengers'.  Everyone is cheering you on both in the workouts and the results. I loved not having to think about what I was going to do at the 'gym', as I had in the past ( although I wasted so much money not going...). When Matt Weaver explained at orientation why Results was different and why the other gym mentality I had didn't work, I knew I was committed to do this.  And I did!  I lost over 23 lbs, and am able to do more each workout.  It does take discipline and planning, but I was determined to be healthier.  The coaches help with modifications for any physical issues and are very concerned about each person's success. Kudos to JJ, Curtis, Consuelo, Brydan, Danny and Will, as well as my new Fit Family to helping me.  I am starting my 2nd challenge and very excited about how much stronger and healthier I can become!<//review><rating>5<//rating><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x809add606d8ddf69:0xa7c811a319792beb</GmapID></record>

The coaches and staff are amazing ----They motivate you and push you to do your best, help with proper form, and give modifications based on any injuries you have or inability to do a certain exercise.  The classes are pretty difficult and you can push yourself and maximize your efforts to make the workout that much better.  A lot of the workout are simple types of exercises --- squats, push ups, wall ball's, and burpees.... lots of burpees.  And if you think you can't do a burpee, you will be able to after a very short time I promise!  And then there is your fit fam.... the most amazing and motivating group of people, who are there, just like you.  To have fun, get an amazing and hard workout, learn about nutrition and suppliments to help you make it through the workout, and overall, it makes you feel like a true family.  I can't recommend Results enough besides to say that if you have been unhappy with your diet or eating habits, need to loose weight and make some lifestyle changes, and the box type gyms are not fitting the bill (because they don't).... Try Results.  If you put in MAXIMUM EFFORT, you will get MAXIMUM RESULTS!  Sunrise..... RISE UP!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

It had been a while I was looking to shed a few pounds and bascially be more fit and energetic. Results was the place to go.

It was definately not easy, one of the most challenging 6 weeks of my life but the small victories during that period kept me going. Sticking to the food plan was the crucial part of the plan and more challenging for a vegetarian. Coaches at results helped me out at each and every step be it meal planning, tweaking them when it wasnt working well and pushing us to the brink at every exercise session. A big shout to coach Lea who was replying to my messages during her vacation just so that my meal plan is tweaked at the right time. This is an example of the amazing dedication these coaches have towards all the challengers.

To start with I never thought I would have made my 20 pound, but with all the tips and pointers I could finally do it, much to my amaze. I feel much lighter, could run much faster than before and rock most of my classes too. Greatest joy is fitting into your old clothes which would have never been possible otherwise.

Thanks fit fam, coaches and results at sunrise. I am a proud member of the gym and looking to get better each day.</text><Name>Akshat Gundar</Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

I started the challenge a week ago and I'm very nervous.  I don't know how I'm going to lose the 20 lbs. Please read the following review from a year ago......   the experience of lori brown is my experience EXACTLY! !!  very disappointed!  You are on your own, they don't teach proper form, don't allow proper warm up, don't teach you to breath. They mention it, but in passing only. It's up to you , really!!! To get your money back. LISTEN CLOSELY!!! YOUR MONEY IS BETTER SPENT ON A PERSON AL TRAINER.

Seems like a good concept paying up front but if you lose a certain amount of weight you get your money back.  In reality be prepared to be pushed beyond your ability without the coach asking what your ability is, what your limitations are.  Be prepared to be punished if you don't put a name tag on- yep 30 burpees and this is even if you are not able to physically do one burpee on your second day in the program and you will not be told that you are required to put a name tag on every single day. You may or may not be told you can modify a push up, a plank or a burpee but be prepared that you may get reprimanded and penalized if you do modify an exercise.  No time to work up to  being able to perform a required routine, do it and do it strong or be called out and humiliated.  Are coaches told to hone in on certain people to get them to drop out.  I am thinking yes- after all then the owners get to keep the clients $400.00 without that client even taking up a position in the class.  I wondered how this gym makes money if they give back the money paid up front - at least $400.00 if you lose 20 pounds..well after spending two days- minus five minutes when I walked out- I am pretty sure I know.  I wish everyone injured or put into a medical emergency in this program would post here- and don't ever think about getting your money back or having anyone who works at this gym or is a business partner in this gym understanding any of its downfalls.  After all - they are getting rich!<//Text>

<text>When you're done feeling sorry for yourself, tired of being tired, ready to start living again, and done being the person you said you would "NEVER BE!!!" When you're tired of hiding from mirrors, and social gatherings, and pictures. When you decide YOU ARE WORTH IT. Run, don't walk, to your nearest Results Transformation Center. Whether you need to lose 20 or 200 this is the place. If you don't want coaches who care, to work out with people that will become your family, and be pushed and motivated while you reach your fitness goals, this is NOT the place for you. This is NOT your typical big box gym...you WIll be greet...you will be shown how to use the equipment...you will be cared about...you will be shown how to make this a lifestyle...you WILL succeed here. Will it be hardwork? YES. WIll it be worth it? NO DOUBT. This isn't just a gym, its a 2nd home. As an ex athlete, now 41 years old, four kids later, I have found my strength, competitiveness, and love for what my body is capable of again. Thank you Results Sunrise with just one round of the 20lb challenge, you have given me mental, and physical health back. Here's to another round and becoming a member.<//text><response>None</response><UserId.>113522871118930635615< /UserId.><username>Dimpled Momma Kennedy</username><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I'll take this moment to thank my friends, family, coaches and the random supporters I have had  throughout this first round of the #results20 challenge.  Regardless of circumstance it's nice to know that ones drive and faith can overcome any assortment of obstacles put in front of you.  Special thanks to Coach Lea, Coach JJ, Coach Curtis, Coach Rachel, Coach Brydon, Coach Will, Jayme and the whole results family - you are truly amazing.  Weight loss for round 1 was 46.6 lbs and the drive to get there was as much mentally challenging as physically.  The friendships built and belief in yourself are worth more than any amount of money.  I look forward to the 2nd round and the the goal set forth the second I came off the scale - beat round 1. :)  There aren't enough good things to say about this program, the gym or the people.  See you around!<//text>< Pics>

<review>I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about Results before I began. I mean, how could I lose 20lbs in 6 weeks! I really didn’t eat that poorly and had tried personal training before so what did they do what was so different? At the same time I wanted results and trying on my own, meaning 1-2 weeks of giving my all at the gym with an hour cardio and an hour weights wasn’t moving the dial like I wanted/needed. After seeing two friends on Facebook succeed through Results, I decided, what else do I have to lose besides time (which will pass anyway) and money (which I can potentially get back). I decided to sign up and I am so happy I did. I was pleasantly surprised at how challenging the workouts were considering the differing fitness levels of members. I was also surprised by the attention to detail and proper form considering the class size to coach ratio. I always felt like there was assistance when needed. The only negatives I can think of are: 1. The first week’s works for M-F repeated on week 2 and week 5’s work outs repeated on week 6.  2. The coach’s tend to play the same music on from their play lists so it can be a bit repetitive, i.e. it’s Monday so, ___ workout, with ___ music. However, the positives, by far, outweigh any negatives. The coaches are all very enthusiastic and it honestly feels genuine, the fellow challengers and members are all positive and encouraging and well, it’ s not called results for nothing! Over 6 weeks I lost the 20lbs, was it easy? No! but was it worth the effort, time and money?! Yes! I am so pleased with the overall quality of workouts and the atmosphere that I decided to become a member.  I highly recommend Results and plan on continuing my fitness goals at their facility. Their staff is the best of any I’ve experienced (Cal-Fit, 24-hour, Anytime, etc.). They get to know you, your goals, your strengths and weakness and welcome you with open arms.  They support and push you (when you need it) to meet you goals. I’m happy that I took a chance with results.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I'm going to start by saying if you are on Yelp, Google, FB, etc. reading reviews on gyms, look no further. Results is the gym you want to go to. I can say that with confidence because Results changed my life. Most people can't say that about a gym. Do I have your attention now?
My story is short and sweet: I am 23 years old and in the year I spent planning my wedding I gained around 20 pounds. That was on top of the 15 I had gained from being happy and in a relationship. I went in to the doctors office for a routine visit and to my surprise the number '180.5' was staring back at me on the scale. I wanted to cry and I knew something had to change. I needed to change. I already had a membership a small gym that has nice equipment but I lack motivation. I am not the kind of person that can walk into the gym and know what I'm going to do. Even with my 'workout' board on Pinterest, I got nothing.
When I heard about Results, I was skeptical. But when I went to the orientation, all my scepticism disappeared. Results is a gym that requires work and dedication. They aren't about pre-packaged food plans or juice cleanses. You eat real food that you cook. You work out with coaches that push you to be your best and you are amongst friendly faces that support you. The environment is upbeat and clean with huge superhero murals covering the walls. You aren't greeted by empty, daunting machinery, but smiling coaches and friends ready to give you a high five. And, my favorite part: you aren't starving. Ever. When you stick to the plan, you are eating every 2.5-3 hours. You have three meals and three snacks, so no starvation going on.
I will say, the 6 week Challenge was not easy. You have to be ready to sweat, and I mean really sweat. But it was EXACTLY what I needed. By the end I lost 21 pounds but I gained so much confidence. I feel healthy again. I am able to fit into most of my old cloths which I didn't think was possible. I am in love with myself again. I still have some work to do, but now I know I can do it. The 6 week Challenge is not just a 'challenge', it's a healthy lifestyle change. It's amazing. You owe it to yourself to try it.<//text>

I am just your average college student. I go to school full time during the mornings, I go to work full time during the evenings, and then I spend the rest of the day sleeping and wondering why I put myself through so much stress and don’t feel any happier. Then I saw this quote by Charles Bukowski. “If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it’s your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life.” My epiphany hit me like a wrecking ball. Life before all the stress was full of physical activity. I lived for the thrill of physical exertion…but lately I’ve been so bummed because I haven’t been living my passion. After that quote I read an ad for Results Transformation. Like everyone else on Facebook, I scrolled passed it quiet a few times before I finally got the courage to give it a go. I was apprehensive because I’ve done the “gym thing” before. You’re there on your own sweating it out and it gets boring after a while, you forget to go, you get sidelined by an injury, and you start making other excuses for why you can’t go. It’s easy to fall off the wagon. But Results was so much more than your average gym! They gave me a nutrition plan, helped me find my whys: keeping up with my speedy little sister, finishing a Spartan Race with my athletic friends, and seeing that 6 pack again! When I told my coach I screwed up my shoulder, she was quick to show me modifiers and corrective exercises to help my aching muscles. I was offered a supportive forum to speak with others about my difficulties during the challenge, both metal and physical difficulties. I was offered so much more support than I had ever received at any gym I had gone to before. My coaches and fitfam at Results Transformation became my reason for continuing with Results after the 6 week 20 pound challenge. I’m now a member of the most awesome place I’ve ever had the pleasure of sweating at and I couldn’t be happier! If you are anything like me, then I’d highly recommend putting away the pizza, getting off the couch, and giving them a go. See ya there!< /Review>

My wife wanted me to give up alcohol for six weeks and spend that money to loose 20 pound in weight loss challenge and this whole experience changed my lifestyle and how I view my health and fitness.  It wasn't easy at the beginning of the challenge but at the end of six weeks I felt it was one of the best decision ever made . I not only lost 20 pounds but my perception changed a lot on many of things .

1. I can fit to my old clothes which I had from graduation ( 8 yrs old ) yet new clothes since I never got a chance to wear them .
2. I feel energised during the entire day after morning workout . I feel I am more productive , active both managing work and personal life .
3. Fit Fam - coach , people at this gym are so supportive and fun.The coaches at Sunrise are extremely helpful and answer all our dumb questions about fitness and clean eating.
4. Now I have new perspective about workout and eating habits . I have made changes even after the 6 week challenge to maintain the weight which I lost which is key to success . I feel discipline should be for life time and not just for six weeks . So I ended up becoming a Fit Fam member after my 6 week challenge .
5. I have gained self confidence , discipline , perseverance.

This 6 week challenge was about eating clean , work out and sticking to the STTFP.. The coaches customized meal plan , reviewed the plan and made sure we stick to it .  They made us work out at least 5-6 days a week. I also made sure I did a 30 -45 cardio in the evening since I used to go to gym in the morning .The six week challenge isn't easy but doable . I lost almost 23 pounds in 6 weeks and now a proud member of the club.

I highly encourage anyone considering this to make an investment in themselves . It will be a lie changing experience and you will life from an different angle .

Thank you guys !<//Text>

If you are ready to make a change in your life and surround yourself wirh positive, motivated people all working towarda the same common goal this is the place for you.
The coaches are awesome and are there to motivate you and push you to help you reach your full potential. They are knowledgable and most of all care about each challenger/member and care about helping you reach your short and long time fitness goals. After six weeks I guarantee that you will feel stronger, confident and a sense of accomplishment that you have not felt before. After my first challenge I lost a total of 22.4 pounds and I cannot wait for the 2nd challenge to begin. There is no other gym that offers pwrsonalized trainning up to 7 days a week as well as a meal plan, not to mention the wonderful motivated staff willing to help you reach your goals and achieve success.

<Date>1455598416659</Date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>I must start off again by thanking the wonderful staff of the Rancho Cordova – Sunrise location for being an AMAZING STAFF and THE BEST MOTIVATORS.  I was 333lbs when I started round 1 but knew that I had to do this challenge again because my body fat and BMI were still no in the proper range.  I’m grateful this rules are in place because in reality I knew that I NEEDED to do it one more time.
Many things stand out about this challenge for a round 1, 2 and 3 person.  First, the coaches were and continued to be SMART, MOTIVATING and ACCOMIDATING!  In most of todays’ gyms you rarely find that, let alone all THREE!  Second, this program continues to make YOU accountable and gives you the structure and plan to succeed.  Third, YOU can succeed if you STICK TO THE PLAN that they give you no matter how many rounds you do.  I stuck to the plan 95% of the time and for that I was rewarded with a total weight loss of 76lbs!
I had my 3rd final weigh-in on February 15th and was so happy to see that I had lost an additional 26.4lbs in my 3rd 6 WEEKS!  I have now lost a total of 76lbs exactly in 18 WEEKS!  There are no gimmicks here and never were, only hard work and dedication by the challengers and coaches at RESULTS TRANSFORMATION CENTER.  I’m proud to say that I completed all 3 of my challenges and would become a member in a HEARTBEAT!  Everyone should know that by sticking to the plan and listening to the coaches and staff at RESULTS, they will succeed time and time again and make their goal of losing 20lbs or MORE in just 6 short weeks.
Thank you RESULTS GYM and Coaches for showing me what can be done!

<review>Worst bike shop ever. They mark up prices on bikes, charge too much for simple fixes, and try to make their customers buy unneeded parts. Never come here.< /review><user>114883203145941043020<//user><Gmap_id>0x80c2cd8f5e890ad3:0x623d35222bbee5a9<//Gmap_id>< pics>

<text>Shout out to Frank and Angie. I brought in my road bike that hasn't been used in a couple of years. While doing the pre-inspection for my tune up, I was told that one of my shifters was no good. While I waited, he tried and tried, but no success. He let me know that he would adjust the derailleurs, so that at least gear ratio wouldn't be too tough. He also told me that it would be a couple of hours before I got it back. Not only did he complete the tune up faster than he quoted me, but he also let me know that he was able to fix the bad shifter. Saving me "$200 plus." Now that's service. He earned my business.<//text>< user>

And about the warranty part sorry no bike give warranty on tubes because we can’t determine where you ride your bike .\n\nSorry you and your wife have to put a bad review because you got a flat again .

<review>This shop is one of the oldest shops around which means owned by the most experienced person ever , Franks has known and worked with bikes since he was a little kid in Italy . So with 40 plus years of experience in bike and mechanic of bikes, people talk so awfully about him just because people don’t value the work and don’t want to pay and expect everything cheap or free nothing cheap or free lasts in this world , if you want great quality work done then come to franks bike shop he definitely without a doubt knows what he is doing. He has 4 kids and each of them have there own bike shop business because he taught every single one of them. Someone wrote a comment on how he racist of Mexicans how can that possibly true if he has a Mexican wife and has been married for 40 plus years with her , that shows you that people on google just like to lie as if they are so reliable . Come to franks bike shop and check it out for yourself , yes sometimes customer service isn’t a 5 but come on he is an old man still working to help us all out with honest bike questions because he knows so much and is know as the a master mechanic . Be patient He is honestly a great person.< /review><user_id>105147150235513690246</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Was new to the area and in need of a new bike decided to check out franks bike shop. Had a lot of different bikes and found what I was looking for at an awesome price. The owner is super nice and friendly will definitely be coming back for tuneups and just to chat with the guy. Very knowledgeable.</Review>

I was looking for bicycle shop around my neighborhood and I came across franks bike shop and right away when I walked in the owner attended me even though dealing with other customers and I needed my bicycle to be tuned up and got it back feeling like if I just purchased it at the store running smooth and shifting with ease the owner also went out of his way cleaning my bicycle when I sure knew I needed one I’ll forsure be coming back and letting my friends know about the store so they can experience the same enjoyment I have for my bike thank you again Frank!</Review>

My bike was involved in an accident while on the bike rack of the MTA bus. I read the reviews of this shop. I thought they were pretty good. But, I was disappointed to find out they do not give estimates. Plus, the guy I spoke to seemed a little snappy. DO NOT waste time calling or going there if you need an estimate.< /text>

I brought in my bike requesting  tuneup and to check the tires as they were flat. I picked up my bike, never riding it and placed it in my garage. A week later I went to take it out for a family ride and the back tire was completely flat. I called the bike shop and explained what happened and he stated that the tire held air. How can you detect a slow leak due to a small hole or bad valve?? When I was 10 I learned to take off my tire, fill the tube with air and place it in a bucket of water to see where it bubbled.
Waste of time and $65.00.</Text>

Hate that place with a passion. I am never going back there. He ripped me off. fist he gave a tube that deflated the next day and then the second tube he gave me (which he charged $7) cannot be pumped with the normal pumps at the gas station. And the best part is this tube looser air everyday, little by little.< /Review>

<review>Been price checking to take my pinarello road bike to have my inner tubes changed and I’ve gone to Jax bicycle and performance bicycle and both were charging around $22-25 dollars each wheel so I came across franks bike shop he was attentive and got the work done at the spot they charged me at a reasonable price $15 each wheel with inner tube and installation they also removed the inner tube to show me that it had a leak for common courtesy from possible thorn or staple. I spent around $30 in total for everything quick and easy. thanks frank! I will be bringing my business to you for now on!</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Came to Franks a little hesitant because of reviews, but since we were at h and salt fish chips we desided to just check it out. the older gentlemen working there was polite by greeting us and asking if he can help us with anything, we replied by saying we were just looking. my hubby seen a bicycle that he used to have when he was a kid (se ripper i think) so we asked for some more information about it and frank the owner was very knowledgeable about the bike and offered a free lifetime service with it. i seen that my husband really liked it so when i was alone i came back and purchased it for my husband. he was like a teenage kid again.
thanks Franks Bike shop the great service well definitely be coming back for all our biking needs<//text><rating>5</rating><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

depending on when you go he can be helpful but us it's a hit and miss he helped adjust my deraileurs and straighten the hanger on my wife's bike, but just stopped by to get two wheel spokes he said he was busy building bikes for Christmas wouldn't bother just to sale me the two spokes did to come back in a week. I won't return to give him my business, unless it's a real emergency maybe<//text>

This guy charged me 14 bucks for an innertube and the next day charged me 7 bucks.

A week later i bought another innertube from him, turned out to be the wrong size and when i tried to return it with a receipt the same day at the very same hour i bought it he told me he didnt remember me coming in and buying it.

He hesitated taking back the tire saying "it looks used"...</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) We went for a tire and they can't even deal with that on top of that, they are careros, the pedals of my bicycle gave them to me about 20 when they are at 10 a lady who attends super heavy bad service would never return.

Fuimos por un neumático y no pueden lidiar ni con eso encima son unos careros los pedales de mi bicicleta me los dieron como en 20 cuando estos están a 10 una señora que atiende súper pesada mal servicio no volvería jamás.<//review></record>

I've been eating there for over 10 years now. Their food is delicious. Portions r generous, and prices are beyond reasonable. I have probably averaged eating there 3 to 4 times a month since around 2010, maybe late 2009. Consistently  good, fresh,and beyond reasonably priced. Kung Pao is awesome..Broccoli beef and chicken..Cashew Chicken. Not a bad item on the menu and I very tried nearly all of em.< /Text>

I go to this unique restaurant many times since I love the special air that is outline this place. The personel is highly helpful and well trained. The service is extremely quick. Not to mention, the food they serve is highly distinguished. I came often and I was always happy. The expense is modest. I highly recommend this place to my friends and family.<//Review>

Ordered kung pao chicken with fried rice and it came hot and tasty! But slightly oily. Portion was great for two small eaters. Owner even waited for us to finish before closing the shop. Recommend!<//text>

Delicious !!! Went here for lunch after reading some good reviews good choice got the #1 combo came with a perfect amount of food for 2 a container fully filled with fried rice container of my sweet and sour chicken and container of chow menu for less then 9 dollars !!! What a deal and when I got to eat it it was quality there chowmein is basic and delicious the chicken was cooked well the breading stayed in wasn’t falling off the rice was flavorful with lots of veggies and it was prepared very quick by a very sweet little old lady will definitely stop by if craving Chinese in the area again if you live near by or see them in door dash give them a try they do phone orders also</Text>

First time in California I was looking for some local Chinese food. This was close to my hotel so I thought I would try it. Food was good the egg rolls were some of the best I’ve had in a long time. They were a bit greasy though. Service was friendly.<//Text>

<Text>Stay far away from here! Worst excuse for Chinese food I have ever eaten! There was only a single guy running the place and he wasn't even Chinese but obviously Korean. I decided to order the "orange chicken" (really just sweet & sour chicken) w/steamed rice and a small chow mein and it came out to $10.51. The guy knew he was ripping me off because as I had a $10 bill in my hand and I was looking for a dollar in my wallet, he goes $10 is good enough! When I got home with the food, I found that except for the chicken, it was barely hot! The rice was lukewarm! The chow mein was lukewarm and the soggiest I've ever had like they were cooked in the microwave! No wonder he made my order so fast! The guy doesn't even have a deep fryer because my "orange chicken" wasn't crispy either and so soggy and nasty! I wasted my money and time coming here! You've been warned!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV9q0g2R6FJnWk8vXOO-fueUzzQJcOWPp1C92Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk1w58C_NqZKOmRCGKZgkzruW0wE3XgX32L8HZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

This is such an awesome place just because it's a hut in the middle of a parking lot with plenty of shaded seating. It's also pretty cheap food for decent cheap Chinese food. They even take credit card!

What I like about the menu is that most items are about the same price, so you can really just choose what you want to eat. I got the chicken with broccoli, which came with either rice of fried rice. I opted for the latter. The portion is decent and I was satisfied at the end of the meal. The carryout is well-packaged and nothing spilled.

I think the only issue is that it took about 10 minutes to get my food, which is a bit long, but not too bad.<//text>

It's fair to say that this place is a 'good deal' if you relate the quantity of food to the price.  However, I find the food here bland and without character, largely because of inadequate seasoning.  Also notable is that they use exclusively American vegetables (corn, mushrooms, carrots, green pepper, celery, broccoli) that are nearly the same in every dish.  You will not find any Chinese vegetables like water chestnuts, bok choy, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, etc. being used here.  The result is rather unimpressive Chinese food that is not really Chinese food!<//Review>

<Text>I would call this place a hole in the wall, but that wouldn't be entirely accurate. It's more like hole in the street--you can see it from afar, but you don't pay much mind to it and instinctively avoid it. There isn't much signage, and it is very unassuming in that old donut shop way.

That however has no bearing on the type of food that comes out of here, however. The tastiest egg rolls (and large, too), the most flavorful Mongolian beef, and the kung Pao chicken exist here. Definitely something to check out.<//Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Nyssa Buck< /user_name><date>1438035284012</date><rating>5< /rating><review>I love this place because of how wonderful the owners are. They are always so kind and friendly. The last time I came here, I saw they handed a homeless person a cup of water who then immediately continued on his way. Such friendly service deserves a good review. The food is your typical take out Chinese food with huge portions. I love their extra garlic-y chow mein, but when I say extra garlic-y I mean extra GARLIC-y. I usually order the #3 combo: sweet and sour chicken with chow mein and fried rice. I can easily split it into 3 lunches so I end up spending less than $3 a day for lunch. There is plenty of parking, but no public restroom. Most people take out but there are tables if you want to eat there.</review>< pics>

I bought a home and wanted to get a home insurance but I did not know about a company that offers insurance services. Luckily my dad recommended Fiesta Auto Insurance. I called insurance professionals and shared my concern and got an excellent advice and service. These guys are very nice and I would strongly recommend their services.</Text>

I'm not sure if it was just apostilles or all services in general, but this place is very unprofessional. I drop a death certificate to have it apostille about a month ago and I was told 3 weeks the max but no I got it after 5 weeks and when I got it I got the apostille of a birth certificate of someone else and my apostille was never found. And the person in charge of this process is Daniel the owner so what can you expect from everyone else? I demanded my money back, I couldn't trust them any more to do it again an take another month or so, or in the worse scenario to lose the death certificate.<//text>

<review>Every year just like most people I have to file my taxes. I always try to file early but for some reason I always get busy and end up doing them later. This year a few of my friends recommended Fiesta Insurance. I usually go to a different office but this year wanted to try a new place. I called a few places and didn’t get a good vibe from them. So I took the advice of friends and went to Fiesta. Was so happy I did!

Everyone in the office was super nice. They first answered all my tax questions and I had many. They are very knowledgeable and professional. Very happy with everything and super glad I took the advice to come here! Will be back next year for sure! And maybe sooner to get a car insurance quote.<//review><userid>105117211577235155052<//userid><date>1588022269853<//date><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I was looking to save some money during these times so I did some research and found one that I might be able to lower was my car insurance. I always see all the commercials about saving on car insurance so I tried. I called a few places and none gave me a better deal. Until I called Fiesta Insurance. They were able to find me a policy with all the same coverages for a much lower price. I went to the office, they are still open, and got my new policy for less. Thank you for the help Fiesta< /review>

Very professional and great service! This was my first year getting my taxes from Fiesta. A lot of my family goes there and they love it. So this year I wanted to give them a try. I am very happy. Chavita was great and really made my experience great. The other tax office I used to go to never took the time to explain things and they always charged me a lot. I am going to get a quote for my car insurance once my current policy ends. Thanks Fiesta< /review>

I was with an other insurance company that has been slowly increasing in payments every month. They're pretty much cheating me and not even telling me every month they were charging me more. Thanks to Fiesta Auto Insurance they locked me in with a great price with a lot of coverage.

if you need any auto insurance don't hesitate to give them a try you'll be a happy customer for sure. They also do taxes which is an awesome perk I'll definitely be using them this coming up year.< /text>< pictures>

I try to shop around every time it renews. So I called around and after a few days I found Fiesta Insurance. They gave me a better price than my renewal with all the same coverages. Same for less! Of course I went with Fiesta. All the other quotes I got were a lot more. My driving record is clean so I should get good prices right. The agent Chavita was very nice and helpful. Was was able to get my policy started in no time. Thank You Fiesta and Chavita!

I highly recommend them if you are shopping for car insurance. Chavita  also mentioned they provide income tax services and notary public. Will keep them in mind for that.<//Review><response>None</response><user_id>109989883718096617413</user_id>< gmapID>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>I was looking for affordable car insurance and called a few places around Anaheim. Every place I called gave me a price over the phone and a different price when I went there. It was so frustrating! I don’t have the time to drive around all day. That was not the case with Fiesta Auto Insurance. I called and they were very nice and helpful. The price they gave me over the phone after they checked my driving record was the price I got when I went to their office. It was amazing! They are just very honest. I almost lost hope but Fiesta saved me. I was able to get a better price than I had before. I was very happy with Fiesta Insurance especially the way they treated me. They are very professional and the office was nice. Don’t bother calling other places, stick to an honest office for your car insurance, they will save you time and money.<//Review><user_id>110025555973760601380</user_id>< Resp>

I was searching around for a competitive priced Auto Insurance. I got a couple quotes from different insurance companies. Veronica gave me the best quote from Fiesta Auto Insurance. Veronica was very patient very knowledgeable about Auto insurance coverage. Thanks again Veronica you definitely know your stuff!<//Text>

< Review>
Easily the best experience I've had shopping for auto insurance. If there was a word to describe them, it'd be 'personal'. No, 'courteous'. Wait, 'efficient'. You know what, they were simply awesome. I am glad I found Fiesta because shopping for any kind of insurance is always a trying affair and they were wonderful. Thanks Fiesta crew.< /Review>

My god where to start. First Daniel the owner the only one that actually knows what the hell he is doing is Never there he used to and I would do my taxes with him every year for 3 years after that he would never be in and I didn’t trust his girls there. Ok well I decided to give a girl there a chance to do an amendment on my taxes well first off it took 3 days to get it done I’d be there 3 hours each day because she couldn’t match up numbers. So finally she had to wait for Daniel to come in so he could figure out what she did wrong. Ok so then he fixed it then I get a letter from irs stating “the taxpayers number doesn’t match there records or is incorrect” oh and mind you to get a hold of them you need to call so many times they purposely don’t answer. Also my whole family had there insurance with them . But removed it with them because they state they open at 10am but are always beyond late your lucky if they are there by 12 it’s ridiculous. And my mother would get upset because then she would be late on her insurance and they would charge her every time and she would complain well if you guys would be here I wouldn’t b late. Horrible fiesta I wouldn’t recommend anyone here.< /review>

<Review>Fiesta absolutely went the extra mile for me (pun intended!) when it came to shopping for the lowest monthly payment on my auto insurance. I fell for a bunch of the radio ads you hear everywhere; upon calling these advertisers, you are given a huge upsell, which I always hate when it comes to service oriented shopping. At Fiesta, I was simply in awe of how professional yet personable they made the experience. They had tons of options for me that I was able to drill down and select from with their guidance. I know that I made an informed and more importantly educated decision on choosing the right plan that fit my budget. I would easily return to them in the future and have already been recommending them to friends and family.<//Review>< userid>

<rate>1</rate><review>So I am sitting in the "waiting area" as I write this. No acknowledgement from the young lady who has two people at her desk. The gentleman next to m keeps sighing from frustration. Waiting ten minutes with no acknowledgment from staff is uncalled for. This wouldn't be so bad if the last time I called I was told I would get a call back. Never received a call back therefore I am sitting here wanting to make my payment to the brokers who dont want to provide customer service. Last month I called three days in a row.with no answer. Come to office.where sign says open but doors are locked. Month before that a lot of the same. We pay you to be our broker yet we have been treated as if our money doesn't matter. Need to improve customer service.<//review>< Pics>

I love my primary doctor!!💞
Dr Helen Tran & the staff at Tri Valley Medical Group in Murrieta CA are all very nice. Gloria whom I believe is her assistant is also very professional and courteous too! She definitely goes out of her way to accommodate me or any situation I might be in or dealing with.
Dr Tran has the best beside manner that I've seen in a doctor in a long long time too!!
If you're in Murrieta CA and are looking for a new primary doctor, then I would like to suggest Dr Helen Tran at Tri Valley Medical Group. 😊</Text>

< Review>
I am a new patient this year. I have seen Dr.Trann in Menifee and Ana Hall, NP in Sun City. Both are very professional, personable and easy going. So many good things to say about both of these ladies, but I love that they make sure everything is checked before you leave (above and beyond) and they really take their time and listen to you. I highly recommend these offices and their staff! First time I went I walked away with pure joy that i found a group who truly cares. Thank you TriValley.< /Review>

Front desk and nurses are always courteous and efficient.  They managed to see me same day when I did not have an appointment scheduled in advance.  Dr. Nguyen takes time to discuss issues and concerns, and
is proactive to resolving as quickly as possible.
Always leave feeling better about whatever my issue may be and the course of treatment prescribed.< /Review>

Joseph DeMattia is the best P.A. Ever!! He is patient, kind, and really listens! I still call him “Doctor” - he’s a P.A., but to me, he is better than any doctor I’ve ever had.
He’s so present when you talk about your medical concerns. And, always prescribes the right tests. If he can’t take care of it, he won’t pretend to know. He will give you a great referral.
And, the office staff is wonderful.
Thanks to all of you!<//text>

This place is amazing! Everyone in the office is so nice and do all they can to help you do your best in the program. I've been a patient for about a month and a half now and have lost over 20 pounds with the help of the program. I saw the best result when I started going to the gym and eating super healthy and follow the eating directions. The program will not work if you keep old eating habits. I would definitely recommend this program to anyone who is serious about losing weight. Also Diana is amazing and is the best worker there.< /Text>

This is a CLINIC, people coming in standing at the counter asking questions,  checking in, lab work,  its busy. Staff does an EXCELLENT job of filtering  and assisting patients. Lord knows most of us see the doctor when we don't feel good, probably not a good time to write review, myself included. First visit was today, new patient, I was provided with excellent service and care.< /Text>

I have been seeing Trinh Kosobucki, NP and I absolutely love her. I have multiple medical issues and she has always been right on top of my problems. I have come to trust her with my care and appreciate her close attention to my needs.
The office staff are always very friendly and proficient in their responsibilities.
I give everyone here an A+!< /review>

I never complain using reviews, but I am heated! If I could give -5 stars I absolutely would!!! Trinh Kosobucki NP was so rude from start to finish. I cannot believe they let someone so condescending and unsympathetic handle their patients. I kept composure the whole time as she made one unprofessional comment after another, and since she is my husband's nurse practitioner (filling in for his primary doctor). However, towards the end, she made an outrageously inappropriate comment about my two-year-old son!!!! I am appalled. And after all that, she still did absolutely nothing productive in regards to my husband's medical condition. She basically just wrote everything in the computer and said, "When the doctor gets back he will help you". The doctor doesn't get back for another 3 weeks! Needless to say we will be finding a new doctor.</text>

We have had a wonderful experience with Joseph DeMattia PA-C and Tri Valley Medical Group. The care from the front desk staff, nurses and Mr. DeMattia has been better than what we've experienced in the past. Wait time as been short and reasonable and the time taken during the appointment has been outstanding. Mr. DeMattia has given us great care and has given us out of the box ideas for our ailments. I highly recommend Tri Valley Medical Group!<//Text>

Everything that others are saying about the horrible customer service from the receptionists are 100% true. I called in because I switched insurances and I might have tore my ACL, so I called to enroll and set up an appointment and I spoke with a lady that seemed like she really didn’t like her job and she had such a horrible attitude and would cut me off and say rude things and acted like I was asking too much for her to do her job. I explained she needed to call the 800 number for eligibility on my insurance and she said she would have to do it tomorrow because they’re closing and it was 4:30p and they didn’t even close until 5pm. (She just didn’t feel like doing it) I advised her that it wasn’t 5pm yet and she started raising her voice and giving me attitude and I asked her for her name and she refused to give it to me and hung up on me. Her name is Marsi and I got her name from another employee and then I spoke to the administrator and she had the nerve to tell me that what I said wasn’t what happened! At that point I was done. I will NEVER be a patient here. They act like they are unprofessional, extremely rude and they do not care about their clients. I really hope the DR realizes this and finds replacements.</review>

<Text>Dr. Toupin is the best doctor I’ve ever seen he actually cares and takes time to explain anything your going through in great detail. I would recommend him to all my friends and family. Thank you Dr. Toupin for being such an amazing doctor I will miss you and hope I can be your patient again in the near future. I wish you the best sincerely Gino A Battista. Also I recommend using the portal for all questions, refills, and scheduling appointments. The staff and doctors will respond quickly it’s much better than calling for anything you need.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Had my first visit as a new patient with Tri-Valley Medical.  My employer changed insurance plans and I was forced to choose a new doctor.  I'm so glad I did.  I met with Dr. Toupin and was pleased with his thoroughness, sincerity, and genuine bedside manner.  Many doctors don't possess these qualities any more.  You are looked at like a case and not a person.  Hopefully, I won't have to change doctors again for a while.< /Text><GmapID>0x80db7e0bc0c46fef:0x8ad6c2f5ad8e7397< /GmapID>< Date>

This is the most disorganized, unprofessional, incompetent facility that I have ever had the displeasure of being a patient at. There is almost always a 20+ minute hold time when you call, the staff is rude and clearly don't enjoy their jobs and they don't follow-up at all. I switched providers and suggest you just avoid this place and save yourself the time.<//review>

<review>I've left you numerous voice mail messages seeking to discuss and resolve the outrageous lab billing I received as a result of an office visit at Tri Valley Medical.

I've discussed these cost with my insurance provider who provided their agreed coverage with your company for these test had they been covered and they amounted to under $ 900.00. Why then would Primex attempt to collect $ 2,700 from one of your patients?

I've also attempted to communicate my concerns with Dr.Ching and have been informed she is  no longer employed by Tri Valley Internal Medicine. I have done everything in my power to insure my medical cost do not exceed my coverage; this is the first doctor and first lab bill that I have had an issue with after seven years of being a patient.

Dr. Lina Ching did not have my written authorization to commit to ordering $ 2,719. in blood work that was not covered under my medical plan. Furthermore, I asked the lab tech if the test would be covered under my insurance, he said yes. Since I have learned from Lauren at Tri Valley on Date Street, the Loma Linda tech I spoke to is an employ of Primex Labs and she does not control his policies or procedures when dealing with clients. This seems like a huge disconnect between the physician ordering the lab work and their in office outsourced Lab Company that lead to this $ 2,719. lab bill. What a racket, the doctors in this group sub-lease space to a Lab Company, so you think you are dealing with the same office. The Doctor writes up a huge list of test, and the Lab Company overcharges the patient, how much of this gets kicked back to the Doctor, it no surprise she isn't working there any longer. But Tri Valley Internal Medicine takes no responsibility and offers no assistance in resolving the matter,  future supporting the collusion between Tri Valley Internal Medicine and Primex.

To this date it is still unresolved, as a collect on my credit report. I will never pay this bill and warn everyone from these unethical gold diggers that call themselves practitioners of medicine. What happen to the Hippocratic Oath?< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Visiting Chapman University for a weekend. Beautiful school. The campus is very well maintained and vibrant. The faculty is excellent and it looks like there are so many things to do on a daily basis, based on the University calendar. I’ve posted some pictures from my visit.

I have a cognitive disability, which they have refused to acknowledge for years -- it meant I could never finish the foreign language GE requirements. So I get to spend the rest of my life in debt for a degree I was unable to finish, because they simply didn't feel like acknowledging my disability. Do not believe any information they give you regarding disabilities or accomodations. This is not a friendly place for you. Go anywhere, literally anywhere, else. Chaptown is gorgeous to look at but seriously: lots of other colleges are pretty, too, and you might actually get a decent education at one of them.< /Text>

<Text>I'm a freshman here and I love this school! I applied to and got into 12 different schools, four of which were top 20 Business schools but I picked Chapman because of how up-and-coming it is and because of the great atmosphere. It may not have the name brand of some of the other universities I got into but once you tour the campus and talk to the students and where they interned, you'll understand just how great this place is.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
I live very close to the campus and a lot of the homes near me are rentals for Chapman students.  Occasional loud parties, but nothing crazy.  Students seem to have a great college experience and enjoy the laidback atmosphere Orange has to offer.

The campus itself is always clean, safe, welcoming, and is truly apart of the city of Orange.<//Review>

I'm a junior here and the school is great! The campus is located in Old Towne Orange which has several great places for students to grab something to eat and hang out between classes. The classes are small and will give you a lot of opportunities to ask questions and participate in discussion.<//review>

Very demanding two years of grad school but appreciate every minute of it now that I'm practicing my profession. It wasn't easy but it was worth it. Almost daily I encounter colleagues who attended state schools and am amazed at how ill equipped some of them are to practice our profession. Chapman graduate programs provide educational depth and breadth and offer students truly exceptional internship opportunities. If you can get into a Chapman graduate program, GO!< /Review>

I had great experiences at Chapman!  I met some smart, cool and fun people and professors while being there!  I enjoyed the AmeriCorps program as it paid $9,500 towards my tuition.  I enjoyed living at a CU house during my grad school years - great experiences!   I slam dunked a teaching credential in 9 months and taught for 5 years, and I earned 2 degrees at CU and now I have my own business as a Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist for the last 6 years.   But geez, the tuition is too much - hopefully there are grants available!< /Review>

I am not student here. I came here twice to study in library. Even Though they open pretty late. Until 3am at the time. Only one minus star is the path to parking pretty dark, lack of lights. I did not feel safe walking back to parking lot. Need more lights</text>

<Text>I had the pleasure of taking this course at Chapman as I try to fulfill my major. I took OLCU501 (organizational leadership) which was very challenging, yet rewarding. The first week was already difficult but the professor was amazing. I had the opportunity to study under Dr. Yossef. She really treated me with respect and was such a great person to learn with. I can't imagine learning under anyone else. Thank you Dr. Yossef for a wonderful experience and for being the best professor.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dcd9e1d9d6e8ef:0x6ebb27c51b72a8ec< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I'm writing this review solely based on the fact that this greedy "non-profit" institution began charging me MONTHLY $100 "late fees" on tuition.  Keep in mind I have paid around $20,000 already for this semester's tuition with about a $2,000 balance left, and we're barely a month into the semester.   This is so tasteless and egregious, I'm glad I'm graduating this semester.  Not to mention Chapman's student business services department can be extremely rude and they're never willing to help you out in any way.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I have never been to Philadelphia but these subs are absolutely delicious. Creamy cheese, watery meats and fresh veggies. Also the fries with the meat seasoning absolutely bad for health but oh so good! They also offer a variety of other things like sides and such but now that I know this place is delicious I'll comeback more often, be cautious though! The subs are hot hot.</text>

Generous portion of meat that was just juicy enough and didn't drip.  Best part was the gooey amount of cheeses melted to perfection.  Service was friendly and we look forward to our next visit. Absolutely amazing.  Get the full size or you will order another one. We'll worth the wait.</text>< Pics>

This place gives the least amount of meat possible to be considered a sandwich.  I ordered the Philly cheesesteak with grilled onions and cheese, since that's what the place was known for, the sandwich maybe had 2oz. of meat, the rest was onion and cheese, I went there based on the reviews and pictures.  I received about one eighth of the meat that the pictures show.  All I could taste was onion and cheese. Their regular cheesesteak comes with mushrooms andbell peppers, obviously that's a bunch of inexpensive fluff.  My daughter ordered a ham sandwich it came with two thin slices of ham and one slice of cheese...
Over priced and overrated.
This was my first and last time. Service was slow also...< /text>

Awesome people. I sat outside on my phone deciding what to order when someone comes out with a bowl of water for my dog. Super thoughtful animal lovers. 5 stars all the way around.. and the chicken. Cheese steak was inhaled in about 2 min. I'm eating here again.< /review>

<text>Very good philly cheese steak! I also tried a Pastrami Burger by starting with the #11 Philly burger and adding pastrami to it. In addition to the Provolone that already comes on it, I should have also added cheddar and bacon. Furthermore it needs some ketchup and mustard to make it perfect. Unfortunately the fries are just average.< /text>< Pictures>

The sandwiches are so so good. The people's favorite is delicious, along with the original Philly. The little restaurant is nice inside, but there aren't many tables and the music is loud. However, there is free Wi-Fi and some seating outside.< /Text>

I'd love to give this place 5-stars but it really wasn't that great of a cheesesteak. Despite the name and all the emphasis on being "From Philly". I found it to be a little dry and the meat wasn't as tender as I would like. Best to try it for yourself and see what you think.</Text>

Great food! Bread is baked fresh on site each day. Fresh ingredients. Excellent meats with generous quantities. Friendly service. Nice mix between hoagie and Philly cheese steak sandwiches. Good reasonable prices.

Can't recommend it more. Have already been 3 times in the few weeks it has been open.< /text>

Drove by this place and it caught my eye.  Was honestly going to go to Philly's Best in Irvine tonight.  This place is amazing, has to be the best Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had in California. Next time you drive by this place - STOP - you will NOT be disappointed.<//review>

Ive ridden by on my motorcycle several times and decided to stop in. The cheesesteaks are awesome and truly the real deal. I was greeted by Mario who made the exp even better !! Quality and flavor make this place a must do for knowalgeable cheesesteak lover . i can call in and my order is correct and hot and ready to go! They have other sandwiches and the Pastrami kills it also made the way you want it!! Keep up the Philly tradition you guys you got it down.</Text>

<text>bread is made on site. meat was almost dry. yellow american cheese added as well. Didnt see any option on the menu to add hot peppers, but i'm sure they do. The cheesesteak was a lil on the salty side and the meat was a but rough. over it was a decent cheesesteak. Price was a lil much for it. It should be a couple $ cheaper for the quality. At the same price point, there are other places to eat that will server different but better food.< /text><name>Pyro Tyler<//name>< user_id>

While the sandwich itself was ok, it just isn't a Philly Cheesesteak in any way. And it's overpriced in my opinion, $11 is just too much for something that isn't what it is advertised to be.</review>

Cash only always gets a bad review from me. What year is it? Even tho the bartender was exceptionally nice, inviting and friendly, I still have to thumbs down this place for being cash only.<//Text>

I personally like hole in the wall bars, the tables are nice well taken care of and there usually someone playing pool. I highly recommend playing here if you like a tounrament that is run well with a good mix of skill levels< /text>

<text>cool spot, nice little dive, kind of inconspicuous in its location so I never found it until recently.  Pretty affordable, good bartenders, nice pool tables.</text></record>

<Text>Definitely not as the name suggests, no place to lounge, and no tails to be found.  Low class dive with local yokels, definitely not a place for new comers unless you're desperately in need of a drink.  But if you have little cash and not so many choices it's one of the better hole in the walls around.  If you're single and looking to meet someone, you'll be quite disappointed, but if you're looking for a round of drinks and a game of pool on bar tables this might be the place for you.< /Text><Rate>2<//Rate><Name>vadim vegas< /Name><userid>114273092430591528452< /userid>< Date>

Beautiful park right on beach. Great for family picnics. Great pirate themed playground for younger kids, walking, bike riding, volleyball, lots of grass and barbecues. Beachside sidewalks.< /text>

I've been taking my kids here for years. It's hard to beat - fun playground, good parking, nice beach access. Not 5 stars because the restrooms need more maintenance and I've never seen the beach patrolled. For families that can be an issue because the sand break is intense even for experienced swimmers.<//Text>

Good parking close to the beach. There's plenty of benches on the beach if you want to sit and enjoy the beach. Para-Gliders launched there too. Clean restrooms<//Review>

Very nice park for a picnic. Not an easy stroll to the beach. You have to pay for parking. Aggressive birds stole my hot link sandwich. I would skip this place unless I am throwing a big event, bbq, party. Not a place for a casual bbq or day at the beach. There are better places in town.</text>

Awesome park and beautiful beach...we stumbled upon this park and beach on a drive down the coast. It was a great place to stop and take a break a well as get some great pictures. It is someplace we would defiantly return to...it had a playground and bathrooms for those with young kids as well as a baseball/softball field...the beach was awesome even in December</review>

Visiting friends,
So basically I wouldn't choose this beach
For me it took too long to get there,
Been to better beaches.
Yet once you get there it is a huge beach crowded but beautiful.< /Review>

It is expansive and easy to be able to find a spot away from others, during the pandemic, and still have room for the kids to play. Not to mention it is right in front of the beach and also ocean. So it's great after the kids get all hot, we wonder through the fin sand dunes and hop in the cool ocean.<//text><UserId.>104416092151872520752< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

<Review>Awesomeness off Harbor Blvd. I've loved this park even before I was a father. Many bbqs  and beach days have been spent here. If you can, rent out the covered picnic area for a wonderful addition to whatever event you plan. Huge pit to grill the most amazing meal possible, running water at the sink area, and plenty of space to lay out all the goodies you can bring. Get in touch with the city of Oxnard to reserve and to turn on electricity. The payed parking lot is rite next to picnic area and is quit large. Parking on Harbor Blvd is free but limited. Get there early on weekends, very popular spot<//Review>< pictures>

Lovely park , weekends you see lots of people celebrating something. Easy to find a a spot to sit in if you're just there with a few friends or family. The beach isn't that far away , its usually the reason i visit this place.<//text>

It is someplace we would defiantly return to...it had a playground and bathrooms for those with young kids as well as a baseball/softball field...the beach was awesome even in December<//Text>< pictures>

This beach is so beautiful! We had no trouble finding parking. The beach and the park are all so well maintained. It looked beautiful! Loved the dunes and saw an amazing sunset!</text>

Lovely park , weekends you see lots of people celebrating something. Easy to find a a spot to sit in if you're just there with a few friends or family. The beach isn't that far away , its usually the reason i visit this place.< /review>

Soccer! Soccer! Soccer! Soooo much soccer. Not only did they take up almost all the grass but there were groups practicing on the beach. That was neat to see. I tried to jog on the beach, but sadly I'm not in shape enough for this beach. Most of the wave area for jogging is on a slant that is enough to take out my core and calves. Although we're fitter then me people crushing it. I was luck the tide rose on the way back to give me a slightly flat area.</Text>

Oxnard Beach Park is a unique park: it has green pastures, plenty of open space, walking pathways, access to the beach, kid friendly, and an atmosphere of community. The 1st ever Oxnard Pow-Wow was hosted las week, what a show of Native Power, honoring our Military Veterans.</text>

Our favorite beach. Great parking with a long walkway, eliminating a long walk on the hot sand to get to where we set up our umbrella.</Review>

Nice park, could use some cleaning and soap in the bathrooms, considering they do charge to park. Playground was nice except it has no swings for handicap children.<//text>

Great beach, less crowded than most of southern California. Watch out for tar clumps. Not sure if they're from drilling or natural. It's worth going all the same.<//Review>

<Review>Great area, from the playground to the water. Great long park with a ton of grass, and plenty of sand to the water too.
The area reminds me of BuenaVentura Beach with the small hills to go over from the parking lot to the water.
They have a concrete pathway that leads you all the way to a good depth into the beach sand.
Between the sand hills there are spots you can stay in that are a tiny bit secluded and slanted too.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80e851ff6737e663:0x3654c0d53ada265f< /GmapID></record>

Paid a couple of dollars for metered parking because I didn't see any free parking nearby.  It was windy on the day I went which was great for flying a kite, but not so great for picnicking. A gust of wind blew sand in my food and eyes. Public restrooms available, but are not pleasant to use.<//Text>

<text>Free parking is on the street (like a mile away from the beach). The park tends to be very dirty around the playground and bathrooms. The beach doesn't have enough bathrooms for such a big beach and the beach has tar globs in the sand. Just like all the beaches in Ventura County its badly maintained beach, such a shame.<//text>< Pics>

They charge $1 per hour. The park and beach are clean and well maintained. If you are going in the water, be sure to scope out the beach where the waves actually come to the sand. You have to find the less rocky spots to be able to enjoy going in.<//text>< user>

<text>This beach park is scenic and picturesque. The only minor drawback is the fact that visitors must pay to park in the parking lot. The shore of this beach has smallish dunes, flowers and greenery that contribute to the natural beauty of the area. This park is worth checking out.</text>< Pics>

<Review>The park is well kept with walking paths and lots or grassy places for kids to play and adults to practice Yoga. You have a park connected to the beach. The best of both worlds. I stopped by the park today between jobs! The water was excellent and the views were suburb. Because of El-Nino the waves were very high and powerful... I got some great video of that but did not take a boat out to see the grey whales so I missed it, even though they are there now!!!!!.....migrating!!!!!!<//Review><time>1556161741068<//time>< UserId.>

<text>The good: it's pretty flat, fairly trimmed grass, has grills and stone picnic tables, impressive playground for the kids, large sidewalks, I also believe theres a place nearby to rent cool quad bicycles and other cycles

The bad: trash cans were full, and seagulls are pretty fearless and will come up to you within 10 feet so watch your food. Me and a friend got pooped on by some 2 different times while I was there.</text><user>117756893568735310350<//user>< user_name>

<text>What a perfect place to enjoy a snack on a sand dune and watch the waves! (No littering, please.  Litterbugs are douches) There's a spacious grassy park with modern pirate themed play equipment, and multiple volleyball courts on the sand. Dip toes in the ocean, walk beach trails, spy on wildlife.  Lots of birds, bunnies, and squirrels.  It's pay to park in the lot, but free on the side of the road.< /text><user_id>117969945219090246773</user_id><Time>1517407475859< /Time><rating>4<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80e851ff6737e663:0x3654c0d53ada265f</Gmap_id>< name>

An awesome park.  Parking is not free however.  Great sets of climbing equipment for very young and slightly older.  Lots of grassy areas, including ball fields.  A couple beach volleyball courts and access to a very nice beach.< /Review>

<Text>This was such a beautiful beach. It was not crowded at all. The sunsets were breathtaking. There was a log of some sort that had washed up on the beach which made a comfortable spot to sit on to watch the sunset. The photos are a little foggy looking because we went when there was a wildfire nearby. That didn't stop us though!</Text>< Pics>

Place to get together, it's a free option if you know where to park on the side streets. If you are planning a big get together like a birthday for young kids or a BBQ theres plenty of space. Some of the things you can do: run around on the grass, eat food, watch your kids on the playground, go to the beach.<//text>

<review>Always a great place to be.  Be warned this place is a madhouse on holidays and summer weekends.  Lots of parking for an all day fee of five dollars.  Around the corner you can rent bikes.  You can bring your own grill and set up just about anywhere. Be sure to bring a jacket because it is often chilly.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Nicely kept quiet family park. Lots of room but not much shade.  Progressively gets more crowded as the day goes on until the total urban experience unfolds. Interesting to some, scary to others. Beware. Pay parking of $1 hour.  Absolutely amazing collection of pop up shade.</review>

< Review>
We love this park!
It can be over crowded at times so if bringing little little ones be aware there's an area for bigger kids making it unsafe for the smaller ones at times. Week days are usually the best time for toddlers, afternoons post school is wild 😍 get for picnics, naps in the grass with the ocean breeze.< /Review>

Nice huge grass and kidz playground. Wonderful beach with expansive views. The pay parking is not convenient unless you carry cash or coins and no change given. What?<//Text>

It's a great place to come and relax, or even come with your family and have a little gathering. I love that you can also throw a big birthday party as well! After the party you can just walk down the walk way and your at the beach.</text>

<review>What a great place to spend a day. Open park, grilling spots, right next to the beach just all around good place to chill. First come first serve on set up location, so you should come early if you want to get a primo spot. Right next to the beach, so not a long walk to play in the waves. Just wish they had had all of the port a potties open. Otherwise perfect picnic spot that we will definitely be returning to.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This was a nice park right on the beach. I came in the summer and the lot was completely packed, had to park on the street. That was fine for me as I think it wasn't cheap to park anyway, plus it was only me - not me, me spouse, children, and all of our accouterments.<//Review>

Love the beach park with the sand and water behind it. The park is super family-orientated, clean and well maintained, and very big! Perfect for everyone!  ⛵< /text>

A beautiful park that is directly beside the ocean. There is not a lot of parking but some available on the street. Theres tons of picnic areas and gazebos that you can reserve for special events. Unfortunately there was garbage littered all over the place which looked disgusting. To make it worse, the seagulls were digging in the garbage as well. The beach is beautiful however !</review>

Playground is really far from the actual water, the bbq areas are also quite far from the playground area, you have to pay for parking and the beach is quite a trek from the parking lot. The playground is nice and this area is clean so I gave it 3 stars.<//text>

It's a fine Park with large grass fields and a big playground themed around pirates. There are two playgrounds for different age groups. Bathrooms. Unfortunately you have to pay for parking which seems ridiculous on a child cloudy day when the park is empty.</Text>

<Review>Drove two hours just to get to this beach because of how wonderful my first experience was when I stayed at the Embassy Suites Mandalay Beach Resort. Had an ocean view room and remembered how beautiful, clean, and quiet this beach was. Albeit, this second time there were more people which is expected for Labor Day weekend. Definitely still quiet and clean regardless.
-Room enough for everyone to have their personal space.
-Love that it's dog friendly (if you leash and pick up their poop of course) when we brought a chihuahua and weimeraner.
-Security drives around periodically to enforce rules which is comforting.
-Bathrooms could be cleaner but I've seen worse.
-Concrete and plastic paths leading to the beach which is great for coolers and feet.
-Waves aren't big so my short self doesn't get swept away.
Definitely recommend this beach to those who are tired of other packed and dirty SoCal beaches!</Review></record></dataset><record>

It's a fine Park with large grass fields and a big playground themed around pirates. There are two playgrounds for different age groups. Bathrooms. Unfortunately you have to pay for parking which seems ridiculous on a child cloudy day when the park is empty.< /Review>

<text>Playground is really far from the actual water, the bbq areas are also quite far from the playground area, you have to pay for parking and the beach is quite a trek from the parking lot. The playground is nice and this area is clean so I gave it 3 stars.<//text><Time>1519853063010<//Time><pictures>None</pictures></record>

<text>A huge playground for kids of all ages. No sand on the playground makes it more baby friendly. Huge grass lot to run around, play sports. Small grills available for picnics. Lots of tables, some have coverage, for group gatherings. Short walk to the ocean, also attached to a jogging/walking path.</text>< user_name>

Best playground in the area, and more than enough room to run around, fly kites, picnic or hit the beach. I hate the ticket machine for parking, but it's still a great place to be.</text>

< Review>
Great park and handicap parking friendly like Hueneme. Not sure what's up with Ventura. Bit of a target problem on sand. Dogs are allowed on sand with leash. One big issue, they are clueless when it comes to the definition of dusk. It appears they think dusk happens everyday at 5.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The playground is large and pirate-themed, there is plenty of room to ride bicycles, fly kites and roast beef areas. It is close to the beach if you want to walk.

El area de juegos es grande y tiene la temática de piratas, hay mucho espacio para montar bicicleta, volar papalotes y áreas de carne asada. Está cerca de la playa si deseas ir caminando.<//Text>
