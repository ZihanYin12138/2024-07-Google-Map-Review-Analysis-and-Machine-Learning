EXCELLENT Service, Location... and GOOD FOOD: healthy, fresh, organic and tasty!!!! No SODAS! But the lemonade basil is so yummy! It's a place worth the drive from Irvine to Dana Point. The appetizer with the salmon... delicious! The different types of combination salad with a topping if steak or salmon... totally filling! The chicken dish ... sorry, can't remember (starts with a "p") ... flavor was divine, smoked edge ... just delicious! Sorry but neither my mom who ordered the appetizer or my brother who ordered the chicken plate and I with the spring salad and salmon have no left overs! That's how delicious and perfectly portioned the meals were. Yummy to the moon and back.<//Review>

<review>Delicious breakfast. Everything was so good. And it was a friends birthday, and they brought her out a weird thing called a Dutch something. That was heavenly!  It was like a thick eggy pancake.< /review>< Pictures>

Exceeded my expectations. Everything was so yummy here! And the eggs were cooked perfectly - both over hard & poached. And the coffee was fire. They have really good cashew milk and really tasty latte flavors. There's plenty of parking, but we came early and parked at the harbor. Overall waited about 20 minutes for seating outside on a beautiful day.</Text>

I bring my dad here for his birthday and they always give him a little treat with a candle so that I can sing Happy Birthday to him. The food is mostly organic and absolutely delicious. The owner and the staff are super nice. My dad is Italian and he loves the pastas. This is a must try place to go. You will definitely be going back. Love you guys at Maison  Cafe & Market!!!<//text>

Great food. Service was good. Creative meal choices. On the healthier side, but something for everyone. I ordered a simple two egg breakfast....but it came with little fingerling potatoes and a beautiful salad of Arugula, strawberries & blueberries. Delicious & healthy without sacraficing taste!<//text>

Scramble dish was good but I highly recommend getting the hot sauce with it. It should be a standard accompaniment.<//Text>< pictures>

We've been here so many times for breakfast but last night was our first time for dinner. I am so impressed with this place. They have the best food and the service is wonderful! I have never had a mediocre item on the menu. Every time I try something new I love it! We had the flat bread and whippped burrata and chicken entree. Amazing! Also THE COOKIE is to die for. It was so refreshing to have non alcoholic options. I recommend this place to everyone! I feel very safe coming to this space during Covid.<//review>

Danielle, the owner, and Andrew, my favorite waiter, are just awesome! Everyone at Maison Cafe has become like my second family. Not only is the food amazing but the service is beyond expectation!

My must have dishes:

1. Whipped Burrata
2. Steak and Eggs
3. Dutch Baby <— get it as a dessert

This is our absolutely favorite place in Cali. My husband and I go a couple mornings and it never disappoints. The food is phenomenal and fresh, the service is great, and the owner even rounds and checks in. The vibes are on point and it just has such a cozy CA coast feel. A MUST TRY if you’re ever in the Dana Point area! ☺️ All the stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//review>

Maison Cafe is a gem! The decor is warm and cozy and reminded me of a  cafe you would see in the back country of Italy. The menu is specifically selected using the best organic ingredients available by season.   My choice was the Turmeric Hummus Appetizer and Wine. My heart filled with joy when my bountiful and colorful plate of healthy goodness arrived to my table! The flavors were so delicious.  Owner Danielle's belief and vision is that we all deserve healthy, organic and delicious food - I can say she has perfected it.  She visits with her guest and when I met her briefly I could sense she is a very special soul leaving her own positive footprint on this earth one plate at a time.  When you are in the mood for a "Getaway" step inside Maison Cafe + Market.</Text>

This cafe was adorable! Every food item on the menu was created with such care and using quality ingredients. I even found some awesome gifts and serving platters while waiting for our order. We took our order to go and enjoyed it on the beach with our toes in the sand. I would love to come back and dine in and enjoy a mimosa or 2!<//Text>

Phenomenal meal.  When we first sat down I looked over the menu and thought the prices seemed a bit high.  After actually eating the food I think we should have paid double.  Everyone should make a point of visiting!<//Text>

They don’t make the bread in house, but they at least buy a quality loaf.  Love this place!  Highly recommend the chèvre toast w the scrambled eggs.< /Text>< pictures>

<user_name>Bond servant< /user_name><Time>1616797210313<//Time><Review>I went mid week last fall it was empty except 1 big party, I ordered the duck pita/flat bread per the servers suggestion and a meat dish “Osso bucco” to go along with a house red wine. The wine I had while I waited for the food to be ready the wine was good but came in regular glass over a long stem wine glass which seemed a lil’ low brass to me. The food was ready fairly fast and both the Osso bucco and duck bread were good but the Osso was very small portion and the “to go” box they put it made it fall all over the place and it looked like a mess over the proper way a main should look, also in my option the duck bread at $18 was very expensive for just pocket bread with some small pieces of duck thrown on. Also if I’m paying even $7 for a glass of house wine I’d hope to get it in a proper glass. The total was $54 which seemed very high for the little food I got and how it came especially from a simple restaurant inside a strip mall. It’s a nice place to bop into if you want to try something diff and money isn’t an option(seemed like a trendy motif). But I wouldn’t take a date here nor go if your expecting something very good at there high prices. Presentation lacks as well as portion size.<//Review><rate>2<//rate></record></dataset><record>

If you’re looking for an independent owned, local restaurant try Madison. The chef/owner has put together a great menu with high quality ingredients. Don’t let the location fool you. Once inside you will feel at home.<//review>

The Dutch baby was extraordinary. It's not the traditional kind, it's fluffy, soufflé like texture. Similar to the famous Japanese soufflé pancakes. The flavor is quite creamy as well.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi2nmSHEN5s5FP_tnCyKK3pMgGZ1yOTPwExNnr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPBtCkVGid_6ON_kX_Ua6gOKqf_KpjRmIPZbOn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<text>I love love love places like this that know how to cook real food bake real desserts and pies and savories and have that panache to boot they know they're making some of the best food in Orange county, super low-key, super low prices, wide variety. normally I expect a restaurant like this to have no real food selection sure they'd have salads and and croissants or even better baked goods than that per se but this place legitimately has excellent entrees for dinner and it's worth taking a trip for the ambiance and French Apple Tarte Tatín alone.<//text>< Pictures>

My mom and I are always on the hunt for exquisite French restaurants. This one is unusual because its upscale and understated at the same time. The dress code is casual and the vide is industrial but country, too, and the food is marvelous.
Just wonderful. I had the Mushroom Tartine and my mom had the Duck Confit Tartine. Both were delicious and just perfectly light and filling. We also each had a basil lemonade which was fantastically refreshing. The parking here is a pain. The lot is tiny and people are going in and out to shop at the surf store next door. Nonetheless I would come back anytime.
The server was attentive.
My mom had taken me here for the croissants which are made fresh daily, but we were too late. Our server indicated they are usually gone by noon. We didn't get seated until 1pm. The wait was only about 20 minutes for a party of 2, and it was definitely worth it (I don't say that often).</Review>

What a charming spot. Our waiter turned out to be the son of the chef, and when we got a chance to chat with her we were delighted by her thought put into the menu. On top of the charm, the food was phenomenal.

I had the osso bucco, tender as any I’ve had. My wife got the leek pie and a salad with salmon we ended up taking home as the portions were sizeable. But I made sure to suck all the marrow and chew all the meat off my dish, because it was that tasty. Excited to come back for more. I just wish more folks in this neck of the woods would be down for tartare! Restaurants don’t serve it because not many order it. Same goes for pate... delicious and nutritious. Vote with your dollars :)<//review>

Ah what a great spot in Dana Point. Just over the PCH from Doheny, the location is a bit of a hidden gem still (although definitely was buzzing this morning).

If you’re looking for sweet, look no further than the Dutch Baby: Light and airy, covered in fruit and marscapone. But the menu is tight, healthy and manicured to maximize taste!

Also, get the mimosas!</Review>

This is one of our favorite restaurants in south Orange County. Amazing food whether you’re going for breakfast lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed. Literally everything on the menu we have eaten is delicious! You must try it if you’re in the area!!!<//text>

An unlikely, unassuming spot for stellar food and very decent wine, tucked between the surfboard shop and the laundromat. Charming Chef Danielle has made a bold move and will no doubt succeed here. I wish her and the friendly, kind staff all the best!<//text>

The staff is extremely friendly and acommodating. They are attentive, know the menu, and are genuine in conversation, even on a busy Sunday. We even took our 21 month old and never felt like a burden.

The menu isn't huge, which is intentional and works well, like your meal is a presentation. It is concise, well thought out, and excellent. Each dish is unique and contributes in it's own way, and the quality of the food is wonderful for such an affordable meal.

Great use of space, pleasing decor and enough elbow room between tables so you aren't sharing your conversation with the rest of the patrons. They frosted the windows, which is a nice touch to diffuse the light throughout the dining room, leaving it cheery and welcoming.

I plan on visiting regularly.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Love this place!  Favorites include the avocado toast and the roasted root veggie bowl for breakfast.  At lunch the Chicken Salad or the mushroom tartine are my standards, but whatever you choose you will be delighted!  Oh!  The warm Olive appetizer is delicious and enough to share.<//review>

Delightful from the moment you walk into the cafe!  Friendly  smiles from hostess as well as guidance on ordering Cafe Style or Market Style  :)  Wonderful variety and high quality ingredients. Owner is on site everyday and works as hard as her team!! You absolutely must have breakfast/brunch here and lunch and dinner  - try all the yummy dishes!! So glad to have such a great, unique spot in Dana Point!! Thank you :) I adore the little details and the love that was obviously poured into every recipe on the menu. This place is a favorite for sure!! ♡♡<//review>

Been to cafe Maison enough times now to tell you what you are going to get.

First. Everything if not 90% of everything is organic and almost all is locally sourced (at least what I have ordered)

Second. You can feel the love infused into the food as you eat it (just like how grandma did it).

Third. Wine list is top notch. Very Comparable selection if not one of the top in the area.

Fourth. Staff is super friendly. They remember my order on coffee which is cool. Always happy and smiles

Try them out. At least twice. And get the duck confit appetizer. It’s amazing.<//review>

Almost a $100 for breakfast. Crazy! And that was for three people. Food was good. Love the Dutch Baby. Steak and eggs are great. My wife hade oatmeal. Probably won't go again due to their prices but enjoyed the meal and atmosphere.</text>

{'time': 1566443317846, 'text': 'Hi Christian,\nThank you so much for your recent visit! I would love to know what else you ordered to get your bill to $100? The 6 oz. grass fed/finished Steak and Eggs dish we offer with organic eggs is only $18, the Dutch Baby (which we agree is phenomenal) is only $12 and the oat meal is $9. That only totals up to $39! Sounds like a pretty killer deal for the quality of ingredients you get when you dine with us. Did you have mimosas, or were there other dishes that you enjoyed with us?

We went here for breakfast. It is a cute decor and enjoyable atmosphere. We were kinda sad, when we looked at the menu though. Almost everything had eggs and nuts in it. I like eggs, but my son is allergic and my husband doesn't care for eggs. My son is also allergic to nuts. It would be great if they added a kids menu, got more than 2 high chairs, and offered a bit more variety than eggs over salad in various ways. Service was great and what we ordered was tasty, just hoping for a bit more variety in the future.</Text>

{'time': 1547093830184, 'text': "Hi Danielle! Thank you for your recent visit with us. There are tons of options without nuts and most of the items can be made to accommodate any egg allergies. Eggs can always be substituted for veggies or asparagus.  There are bowls, breakfast plates, toasts, salads, tartines and more... only a handful have eggs and/or nuts. Next time you're in, ask for Danielle and I'll make sure we find something on our menu that works for everyone. As for the high chairs, our storage is limited and at the moment we only have the two.. but all of the staff love the littles, most of us are moms, so feel free to hand off the little one :) see you soon! - Danielle"}<//response>

FANTASTIC! The delicious food is rivaled only by the positive energy of the Owner/Chef. She is an absolute joy! If you let the strip mall with a bait and tackle shop scare you, you will miss out on a truly wonderful dining exprience!< /Review>

YES, YES, YES! What a wonderful new spot in Dana Point. The food, the sevice, the experience... it was all absolutely amazing. You can find some unique dishes made from the best ingredients. The only problem is narrowing it down. We will 100% be back (many, many time). I highly recommend this place. Plus, its owned and managed locally!< /text>

<text>Waited to sit, waited to order, waited to eat and waited for the check. We were there for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, and it only took about 15 to eat, so don’t come planning on an hour lunch. (We were a party of 5) I had my 1 year old with me and after an hour of waiting asked for a piece of toast or something to tide him over until the food arrived. It took 15 minutes to bring out two slices of bread for a crying baby?

Also don’t come with a big appetite! Not a lot of food, especially for the price. Good quality ingredients, but some dishes lacked balance. I couldn’t taste certain elements because others were too overpowering. (I’m looking at you prosciutto tartine). Enjoyed the grain salad though!

Definitely checks all the boxes for trendy local cafe. Would probably come back if it wasn’t for all the waiting around we did.<//text><Date>1553201909325<//Date>< GmapID>

<resp>{'time': 1553232986494, 'text': 'Jane, I am so sorry that you were so disappointed with pretty much it sounds like everything today. I\'m not sure if you\'re visit with us was today or another day, but either way it sounds like you were less than pleased.\n\nAll of the tables in the restaurant are designed to seat parties of two or four, and that combined with an amazing full restaurant at lunch most likely led to you being placed on our wait list. We do our best to seat parties in a timely manner, but also stand firm on the belief that Maison means home and we never want guests to feel rushed to leave when they are done dining with us. My sincerest apologies if the wait was longer than expected for your lunch break.\n\nBeing a mom myself, I can\'t even imagine how my kids survived eating out in the era before ipads and baby shark! I know that part of it was due to the never ending supply of cheerios, juice boxes and crayons that I kept stashed in every pocket of my diaper bag! I know that 5 seconds can seem like an eternity when your baby is crying and I\'m sorry that our made to order toast wasn\'t as speedy as you would have liked (cheerios are handy little things).\n\nOur dishes are all designed with the freshest, best organic ingredients possible with the mindset that you should never leave a restaurant with a "grease gut" but instead leave energized and ready for the next adventure of the day! Our prosciutto tartine is one of our favorites with our house made creamy ricotta, dressed organic arugula, salty prosciutto, roasted heirloom tomatoes and sweetened balsamic reduction... what\'s not to love! Talk about an umami bomb, you are hitting each of the major senses of flavor in one of our most popular lunch dishes, perhaps not for everyone, but definitely one that most enjoy. We love the grain salad too and are glad you enjoyed it as well!\n\nWe like to think of what we do at Maison as classic with a twist, focusing on only bringing the absolute best in food, hospitality and ambiance to each and every guest that walks in our door.'}</resp>< UserId.>

<text>It' not a special occasion restaurant.   We started coming here several months ago and we were blown away initially by the food.  But now that we have had a chance to come back repeatedly we find that some of the same issues stand. Number one it's very noisy and the environment is impersonal which some people would say is relevant to a bistro, but you have to keep in mind you're in a strip mall off of Pacific Coast Highway, not on Paris. The salmon that was on our salad was pretty much flavorless and was overcooked  If you were to compare it to a local restaurant in San Juan Capistrano called Ciao Pasta you would be very underwhelmed. Our Coq Au Vin was over cooked and undersauced.
That being said, service was just fine and they were on top of things. Great place to go for good food and good friends to just catch up.< /text><Rating>3< /Rating>< time>

<Response>{'time': 1563342536375, 'text': "Hi Stephanie, thank you so much for joining us and for continuing to come in on multiple occasions, whether if it was for a special event or just to catch up over good food and a glass of wine.\n\nBeing that you yourself are a small business owner, I'm confused as to why you wouldn't voice any of your concerns to your server or myself as I'm sure we've had a chance to talk on one if not more of your visits. I'm sorry that the food disappointed you and can assure you that we would have either taken care of your meal or replaced it if you had let us known that there was any sort of problem or dissatisfaction of the dishes, I actually love getting feedback from guests and will always be disappointed when someone would rather say everything is ok, just to later leave a poor review on a business that has heart, soul and determination in every ounce of what we do.\n\nI love the sound of the dining room and although it can get a bit boisterous... it reminds me of being home with tons of family and friends on the holidays or just a good old fashioned get together... even if we are in a goofy little strip mall in Dana Point rather than France.\n\nWishing you the best success in your business and I do hope that if ever one of your clients finds room for improvements in what you do on a daily they give you an opportunity to hear it before they tell their friends, family member or strangers on the internet that they should look at your competition around the corner."}< /Response><name>Stephanie Frisch< /name>< pics>

Great food and great atmosphere. Coffee is fantastic. Restaurant has a very nice farm-to-table feeling to it.
Owner has apparently collected China for years which adds a nice detail to experience of dining here since most of the plateware is different types of china.
Definately try the Dutch baby! Worth the wait!
Only warning is that this place has a long wait on the weekends. As long as you come prepared for that you'll have a great time.< /text>

Staff was great. Food was excellent. I had the Dutch and it was amazing. Such a great mix of greens and poached eggs on top was perfect. Added house made sausages and it hit the spot. My wife had the Chevre and it was great too. Definitely recommend this spot if you are visitng the area.<//Text>

Amazing restaurant and market right on PCH. The staff was incredibly nice, the food was organic and delicious with a variety of options for everyone who was in our party. The desserts were amazing as well, especially the chocolate panacotta and the tiramisu. The cashew milk honey steamer was quite tasty. Definitely worth multiple visits. To top it off, the head chef came out to see how our meal was and she was an absolute delight to chat with. 5 stars hands down!</Text>

<Text>Wanted to try something new instead of my Laguna Beach go-to's and heard a lot about Maison. Cute atmosphere, friendly staff and good standard food - toasts, Dutch baby, quinoa bowls and some to-go items in their fridge case.

Im giving three stars only because I wasn't wowed and felt the menu could be a bit more exciting with a daily special, flavored coffees or some more interesting pastries in the case.  I also don't like the enclosed feeling with the windows being completed frosted. I know it looks out to a parking lot but I felt a bit claustrophobic, is that just me?

I did LOVE the Dutch baby though. It was perfect with that marscapone cream and berries. Also free coffee refills after I downed my latte was the ultimate plus.<//Text>< Pictures>

Maybe you ate something prior to coming in that left a lime flavor lingering? Morning margaritas do that to me too sometimes.\n\nHave you ever gone to the market and shopped solely in the organic section? If you have then you know the cost difference... that along with our carefully put together menu add up to a very reasonably priced breakfast lunch or dinner.\n\nHave a great Friday!"}<//Resp>

Dana point has added another great restaurant. Cute place no pretense just great food and very good wine list. Hade the baseball cut swordfish. Haven’t had swordfish that good since zuloo cafe in laguna closed. The coq sure vin was terrific as well. I will definitely be back! Congratulations to this new restaurant and chef/owner.<//text>

<Text>Good food, friendly service and the salsa bar was kept at a frigid temperature, i have gotten sick in the past at other establishments or trucks so i check these things now. if the salsa is not kept below a certain temp it can turn into a bacteria fiesta. but this joint was up to code.</Text>< pics>

Their food is great. As close to home cooked as it can get and a must try. I have been to a couple other Super Albert's and its the same consistency w/ taste and quality. A must visit if you desire mexican food<//Review>

Great tasting, quality Mexican food. Breakfast served all day, if that's your thing. Call your order in to avoid the wait.< /Text>

Absolutely love this place. So does my whole family. When we can't think of what we want to have for lunch/dinner, Albert is the answer! My kids love this place as well and they're really picky eaters. We come here at least once a week.</Review>

A plethora of choices for under $10.  The chili relleno burrito & enchiladas are my most common choices for this neighborhood fast food place. Food is quickly made and I've never had to wait too long.</review>

Super Albert Fresh Mexican Food.

I've referred many people to this restaurant since it opened this year. This is my go to quick mexican food place. The potato tacos are my hubbys favorite meal. Everything on the menu is GREAT. Friendly staff, the cook is the owner. Welcome to the neighborhood.< /Review>

I started going to Albert in Alhambra.  The food and staff were amazing.  They followed me to covina and then finally here in Glendora.  This is family owned and worth every penny.  The food is authentic and tasty.  Love the prices!</review>

Very friendly staff and the place looks very clean. My family and I barely found this place, so we have not tried many selections from the menu. But we definitely will be coming back!< /text>< pictures>

<text>Super Albert #4 is located on a free standing building on a corner lot. It has easy access and plenty of parking. It's not too big inside, but it is a good place for a quick meal. It looks clean inside too. I did not have to wait too long for food. The young  girl at the counter was friendly and helpful. This place has a small selfserve salsa counter. The beans, rice, and meat were all salty, but it was still good. The carne asada was cooked right and it had a good flavor. I will give this place a second visit. Just go easy on the salt, Super Albert #4.</text><Name>Frank Lares</Name>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Delicious food! The wet burrito is the best around, covered in very tasty red sauce, guac and cheese. The asada is fresh, so flavorful and good quality meat. I don't like beans, but theirs are so good! The taquitos/rolled tacos are amazing too. They're covered in quality thick, chunky guac (no "guac sauce") and topped with cheese. Service is friendly and quick. They take phone orders too!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c328b9297e739d:0xb2b0fb2e856719d9</Gmap_id></record>

Do not go. I repeat do NOT go. If I could give ZERO star trust me I would. Expensive for no reason at all, and food was and is disgusting. Service wasn’t even that well for the tip to be included in the bill. Save your money.< /review>

The food was maybe 2-3 days old, bad quality and let's not even talk about customer service!
If you are eager to try Guatemalan food, please...this is not the place! Unless you want to waste you money as I did today!
There used to be another of this restaurants in Oakland...their food was "amazing".  They closed a few years a ago...I don't  think the one in SF is owned by the same person anymore!
What a shame!...they not even accept debit or credit cards...CASH ONLY! 👎🏻
I think even one star service is too much!<//Review>< Pics>

The lady was nice, but the food was not authentic. The tamal was not good. The pepian had no flavor and did not taste like pepian at all!! I had to put salt and pepper to give it some flavor so I could eat it since I was hungry. The horchata was horrible taste like water and sugar. The prices are very high for the quality of food they serve. 6 dollars for 1 nasty tamal is ridiculous. It was full of huge raisin hardly any meat. It was a big waste of money for my family and I.</Review>

Exposes Guatemalan culture and authentic food; however, it's overpriced and the staff service has room for improvement.</Review>

<Review>My family and I had a party of 7 and the waitress had us squeeze together on two small square tables put together. Then we were served fruit and the watermelon had a soapy taste. To cut this short: small portions of food, overpriced food, rude waitress, and overall bad experience. I don't recommend this place for anyone and I will most definitely never come back again.</Review><user>109268279539405481594<//user>< pics>

(Translated by Google) To be exact, the very simple food ... I ordered "El San Miguel" from Guatemala has nothing !! The dishes there are very "American" ... The "garnish" with fried bananas and refried beans., Typical of Guatemala (The fixtures that I talk to them on the outside were hot and in the center cold ... I think they were from the fridge) terrible steak !!! 40% was fat., Without any flavor! I ordered as appetizers some toast ... they were pieces ... not whole toast ..., well ... the very high prices for the quality of food offered by this restaurant ... I do not recommend it.

(Original)
para ser exacto.,la comida muy simple...pedi "El San miguel" de guatemalteco no tiene nada!! Los platillos alli son muy "americanisados" ..Los "adornan" con platanos fritos y frijoles refritos.,tipico de guatemala (Los fijoles que les platico por fuera estaban calientes y en El centro frios....creo eran del refrijerador) El bistec terrible!!! 40%era grasa.,sin sabor alguno! pedi como appetizers unas tostadas....eran trozos...no tostadas enteras..,en fin...los precios muy altos para la calidad de comida que ofrese este restauran ..,no lo recomiendo.</Review>

I had been meaning to stop in here for some time and I finally found myself in their parking lot with a few minutes to spare so I went in and I'm glad I did. I felt a little intimidated as I walked in but those feelings quickly subsided thanks to the friendly staff. Great shop, very clean  we'll organised and very informative employees that made me feel like One of the guys rather than a customer. They answered all my questions and made some great suggestions. Even the parts guy gave me a couple good tips when he saw me looking at a couple bikes. I will definitely be back with some business for them.< /text>

We found them by just scrolling. And thank god we did. My Hubby has been wanting a bike for a while and we finally made the decision and he found the perfect one her. And the service and support we got from John was wonderful. He went above and beyond to help us with everything to help us get this beautiful addition to our family.
Thank you guys for all the help and our new baby. And our new adventures. 😊😊😊😊😊< /text>

<Text>It has a large interior and quite a few bikes on display.  Lots of clothing and knick knacks and the T-shirts were well under the usual $40.  Bought a large for $25 which is my limit for a T shirt that advertises a dealership.  Well worth stopping in, the young woman at the front on Sept 10th 2016 around 2:30 pm was very outgoing and helpful.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqmwpMBvqpjGIo3KiaHJ7FVlVygCbiRf0Hsgwk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNQOOzGecm5srRAUpWQiI1qljRvssIra3ZYLcd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Rolled in with a bad clutch Saturday morning Days from home. The amazing people in the service department put me at the head of the list. Had the parts in stock, and met my needs. Shane the tech that took care of me had Nimble experienced hands. He moved efficiently and thoroughly impressed everyone in my group.
Can't thank the the amazing team that made us comfortable and got us back on the road.
Shane has a sense of humor.  Told me to take it easy on my new clutch for the next 1000 miles or so....like that's gonna happen.

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I gave them a call to talk about a used bike and they did their best to help me find something to fit my budget, I went in today almost a week later and Michael(sales) remembered our conversation showed me some of the used bikes they had on hand that were in the range of what I was willing to pay, we talked for over an hour while I was deciding what I could see myself in. There was no pressure, no up selling just a guy who loves harleys and wanted to get me in something I would be happy with. After talking I took a look at the new bikes in my price range( better deals this time of year) and I decided on a new Street Bob 107 he worked me what I consider a great deal gave us some t-shirts and a good deal on a helmet.

This was just a great buying experience there was no bs they gave me a amazing bike at a price I can live with. All the staff was friendly(especially Mr. Jimmy) and super helpful.

My wife says she would be comfortable going in there on her own to get service, buy parts or gear, or buy a new bike without getting treated like she didnt know anything (it happens some places)

Based on my experience I would not have any problem sending someone in there to buy a bike.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Needed an oil change at 6000 miles during our Route 66 round trip ride out of Seattle. Used the HD dealer located app to locate a full service dealer. We were coming into Eureka CA., called the dealership and they were more than happy to accommodate my needs; in and out within an hour, no appointment required. Nicole was AWESOME!
Thanks Redwood HD of Eureka, CA.</Review>

I just have to give these folks 5 stars today! I bought a pre-owned Sportster 1200C from Brandon July 9th and have very happily ridden it every day since then. I was happy with the deal we made and all the associates at Redwood H/D have been helpful and knowledgeable and always responsive to my questions and concerns. Sales, parts and service are all very professional and have helped me get my new ride squared away with all the accessories and custom equipment I had wanted. This has been a first rate experience. I just had new tires mounted on Saturday and Stephanie in service called yesterday to follow up on my satisfaction with the job. I was pleased to tell her I was very much so! And both the mechanics, Larry and Shane, have readily (and patiently) shared valuable tips and helpful facts and answered many questions I have had about my new bike.

So Kudos are in order for everyone by name: Brandon, Ryan, John and Cheryl in Sales for a good deal; Helen and Nicole for tireless help with checkout and gear; Justin and Victor in Parts for getting my stuff in fast; Robert, Stephanie, Shane and Larry in Service for fixing my screwups and not ribbing me too much about it! You guys definitely Rock in this town!!

So go buy a great machine from these folks - they have a surprisingly large selection of new and pre-owned M/C's - ON SITE - for you to test ride today!! Just tell 'em "Chahlie" sent ya!<//Text>

Redwoods H-D always treats me well and takes great care of my vehicle/motorcycle. I think that people forget that these are vehicles, not just fashion or status symbols and I like being able to have my bike serviced by the people that know it best. It lets me eat up those miles.
Redwoods H-D also has a great selection of motorcycles to choose from.</text>

I showed at 10:00 with my bike and was back out the door at 12:30 with a new starter clutch. The service writer was very friendly and made me feel welcome and important. The mechanic got working on my bike as soon as he finished the first one he was working on. I will make note to stop in and day hi when back in town.

My dad and I are on a 3000 mile ride through all the national parks in California. A number of the staff came up said hello with a smile and a hand shake. They asked how our ride has been going and where we were headed next. The owner came out as we were leaving and took the time to take a few pictures of my dad and me with our phones.

Whether you are in the neighborhood out padding through, make it a point to come in and say hello.<//Review>< pictures>

I was on my way from the Bay Area up to Seattle last weekend when my Super Duke started overheating just around Klamath. I barely managed to get back to Eureka where almost every motorcycle shop was closed. I was seriously worried that I would get stuck there (I had to be up in Seattle for work the next week) when I ran into Brandon at Redwood Harley Davidson (the only shop open in town). Brandon went above and beyond to help me out. Not only did he manage to find somebody to give us advice on the phone for how to deal with KTM bikes, he also went through the recommended procedure of bleeding the cooling system with me. It took us about two hours at his garage to get the bike back into shape. At the end Brandon didn't even accept payment for his work. I am truly amazed and inspired to pay it forward. Brandon is awesome!<//review>

Let me ride home on a bike that almost killed me because the motor mounts weren't tightened neither was anything else on the bike after $6,000 job I had to spend another $3200 to get it running correctly and fix all the problems they made... these guys shouldn't be allowed to touch a motorcycle let alone have a dealership< /Text>

<Text>4 of us Canadian bikers rolled through the 299 en route to Eureka for the night July 7. 3 of us on Harleys and 1 on a Triumph Thunder - something? About an hour out the Triumph is spraying gas from the line and we can't fix it.
We limped into town, find a Hotel and look for a T dealership.
There aren't any and no place open on Sunday,.
So next morning we roll into Redwood Harley and Max has a look and identifies a faulty O-ring as the culprit. After a couple hours he finds a Harley O-Ring that actually works, puts everything together and we are ready to roll.
The bill? the outrageous sum of $4.97 LOL
Had we not spent over $1,000 on Harley stuff at retail while we waited we would have felt even more guilty. ( A shout out to Samantha who was awesome as well )
So we tipped Max a few bucks and were on our way,
Redwood Harley; we had a tight schedule to keep and you saved our respective derrieres
To all others reading this post; this is why you buy Harley. No other brand like it….no other bike like it.....no other support network like it.</Text>< Name>

I came in with basic questions about a bike and the sales person couldnt answer a single one. From how large gas tank, type or seat, if it had a tach gauage, or engine type. First thing that he spoke about, go figure, was prices. After talking to the tech and being handed the manual for the bike to look it up , i got what i needed to know.</text>

<Text>Brenda was very helpful and knowledgeable! She was very patient throughout my whole visit. I was there for about 3 hours and not once did she give up on me. I am a very pleased customer with the attention Brenda provided for me and my family! I now have a brand new iPhone 11 Pro Max and amazing service at a super affordable price! Thank you Brenda & Cricket!<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>I don't usually like to deal with workers at stores because I prefer going online or making calls so I prepared to be at Cricket for a while but I felt very welcomed when I entered the store being greeted by Jackie. I had questions about my plan and possibly adding another line but with Janets and Jackies help I was satisfied with the answers and I left pretty fast. All in all I had a great experience, I really liked the environment and I wont hesitate to stop by again.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

There's no negative star rating so 1 is all this buisness deserves.

My mom came to this location out of curiosity to see how much she could save in comparison to her then current provider.

The rep managed to sell her on the cheap service rate. She then went into the prices of the phones this threw my mom off since she spent so much on her previous GalaxyS5 phone so she said she would come back when she could afford a new phone.

Well the rep jumped into sales mode and told her she could use her phone after minutes of stalling it was obvious the phone was not compatible with crickets chip the rep told my mom her phone was old and could not work and she should trade it in for a credit for the new phone. My mom a nieve senior believed this greedy sales person then she asked my mom to sign a "WAIVER" saying she gives up her right to reclaim her phone.

The phone she was given was a cheap knock off at 40% off because she traded her GalaxyS5. I went in to reclaim her phone and the manager David said the phone was already taken to headquaters and we were SOL.

I asked for his business card he said he had none I asked for his district's managers info he said he had none. This estblishment preys on nieve consumers then protect themselves with waivers once consumers had figured they have been screwed.

The worst part is all the people who work here are young taking advatage older seniors.</Review>

Beautiful place to live or visit. You can’t go wrong with the ocean views, private beach access, community pool and clubhouse, tot lot and more. The grounds are beautifully landscaped, kept very clean and the gate access personal is always friendly and helpful. This is the place to live in Dana Point.< /Review>

Very nice and well maintained beach gated community
Most of the houses have been remodeled or rebuilt in the past 15 years. Secluded private beaches between South Laguna and Dana Point next to Ritz-Carlton</Text>

This spot sure knows how to treat their customers. Consistently with a very kind mindset. The food is reasonably priced, always flavorful and neat.< /Text>

Nothing better than having my good slice of pizza before the movie night that I have with my family..
I love the size of the pizza slice ..
A lot of cheese..
A lot of choices...
Keep the good flavors and we will come back!!!
The only thing we didn't understand is the cashier ..
He was a little bit confused in what to do and how to even charge us..
Please don't forget to say the you guys accept Samsung pay...
People get frustrated if you don't even know that you have it...
They just turn around and go..
Besides that ...
All good.
Thank you< /Text>

Absolutely delicious!! The closest thing I can get to New York Pizza. My family and I love this pizza and the large slices take me back to my childhood home in the Bronx New York!!! I recommend this pizza place to all my friends because there’s no other place that can even compare.< /review>

This review is specifically geared towards the outstanding service provided by the team here at Greco's

We had a pizza party here for our daughter's birthday yesterday, and let me tell you, the staff here did EVERYTHING to make the experience an amazing one, and not once asked for anything in return (other than paying for our food/drinks of course).

I have really never had such stellar service like we had here yesterday. From asking for paper clips, and tape, to a cake cutting knife, and everything else in between, they delivered on all requests, and most of them without us needing to even ask for them. They basically let us take over a big portion of their restaurant, with balloons and the whole nine yards, and simply asked what they could do to help.

If I could give this business more than 5 stars, I would in a heartbeat. The pizza was delicious as expected, the service was absolutely outstanding, and the experience they helped our daughter and her friends have was priceless.

Support this business, because they truly deserve it! Thanks to all of the Greco's team for making it an unforgettable birthday party!< /text>

<text>We went to Greco's for pizza on New Year's Eve. The pizza was fabulous. Our kids got individual slices so they could pick their own toppings. A slice at Greco's is easily 3 times the size of a normal slice of pizza. Each of my teenage boys was completely full off their one slice and they are both big eaters. Apple pie dessert pizza was also really good.</text><gmap_id>0x80e83abb6cf13f65:0xc6d91fd5ccd79594< /gmap_id>< name>

This pizza is and was the BOMB! I ordered a NY max slice, it was thin crust, super delicious, and the staff is phenomenal!!!!! 10/10 for crust, flavor, and deliciousness! Was in thousand oaks for a work trip, and am so glad we came here for lunch! Totally am going to come again before I head home!</Review>

It’s edible but it changed ownership again and it’s not New York pizza, they should not be calling it Greco’s anymore. It used to be our favorite pizza place but now it’s not even comparable. The cheese tastes like string cheese, the crust is very thin and tastes like a baked Mediterranean flat bread. It’s not pizza dough. If you liked the old Greco’s then I do not recommend coming here.</review>

Extremely tasty, authentic NY-style pizza with a thin, flexible crust & plenty of cheese. The max slice is truly massive at almost a quarter of a full XXL pie, and even a half slice is a good size. Pricing's not too bad either. Staff is friendly and good-natured; the restaurant itself is a bit small, seating for about 20, but the outdoor pavilion/terrace is more than large enough to accomodate a larger crowd.< /review>

Went to Greco's for a quick pizza (08/22). Ordered Greco's special pizza to go. A gentleman who was preparing the pizza cut the corner, served us already prepared cheese pizza + toppings, and two slices. On top of that, he missed out a requested topping which he added later upon our request. Basically, we ended up with a poor service, expensive piece of slices; not only their pizza was expensive but the service was equally poor. I will never go back to this place, unless they reduce the cost and improve their service.< /text>

It was my first time to Greco’s and I wasn’t disappointed.  This place is better than expected.  First of all the portions are very generous, fed my wife our four kids and myself on a large Greco’s Special pizza and a large greek salad.  But the food was ridiculous.  If you’ve had New York style thin crust pizza you know how good it can be and this place proves it.  The ovens are front and center and we were able to watch our pizza chef carefully bake the crust to just the right crispness.  The sauce, mozzarella and other toppings were fresh and flavorful, easily the best pizza I’ve had in years.  The salad was also excellent, tasted as good as you’d expect from a much more expensive restaurant.  The service was prompt and friendly. This is our new go to spot for pizza.<//Text>

Our first visitisit, ever. Lucky's Dog House was closed, our usual place. Ordered Ravioli with Alfredo sauce, Kid's Macaroni and Cheese and Garlic Toast with Cheese.

Order took forever, oddly. Finally received our food and went outside to eat it .

It was absolutely inedible. The Ravioli w/cheese and Alfredo was starchy,. Really starchy and pasta was gooey. The kid's Mac m cheese was cold, dry, and worse than Kraft microwave macaroni and cheese tho it looked EXACTLY like it. The cheese was dark orange and sparse, and dry and not sticking to the noodles.
The garlic toast with cheese was tasteless, except for a strange chemical/metallic aftertaste.

We immediately returned and asked for and was given a refund of our $21 with no argument, thankfully. We appreciated that.

Not sure what is going on at this place but I would sternly caution anyone from doing business here until major changes were made.< /review>

You mentioned that the ravioli wasn't to your liking and now you're telling all my potential customers not to visit.  People love our pizza.   Again, people love our pizza.   Once again, people love our pizza.\n\nThe garlic toast is wrapped in aluminum foil (perhaps you're sensitive to aluminum foil).  People consistently tell us they like our garlic toast spread.  The kids mac and cheese is Kraft mac and cheese.  That's what kids like.  Cheers."}</response>

<Text>This has to be my first time posting a review.......
My girlfriend and I walk into this place for the first time and the first thing we notice is that it is boiling hot inside. Much hotter then the summer day outside, but being an optimistic person I think nothing of it. We order two Greko's style slices, no bell peppers which totals out to $18.21, my girlfriend gives $20.25 and is given $1.04. So already we were a dollar short on our change but again optimist. We get our food, take it home and sit to eat only to see what I can only describe as a horrifying mess...
First, the mushrooms were raw and cold and so were the olives. Second, the sausage was ground to sand, and the pepperonis were stone cold. Third the cheese looked as if the pizza sat for a day or so and lastly the dough smelled as if the oven or pan it sat on was dirty. Nothing stuck to the old cheese resulting in an avalanche of topping falling off the moment we picked it up.
I tried to call the store back to speak with a manager or owner and was told they were not in. I tried again the next day and got the same answer. So now I turn here to post this unfortunate experience of ours and if I could post this pictures we took of the dreadful food, I would...</Text>< Pics>

You feel like your interrupting a really intense argument when you ask for anything. When you order it's like the cashier is waiting for you to turn the register around and run your self up. They charged me $1.25 for ranch. Damn. I have a special place in my heart for this pizza place. I saw a lot of movies next door and ate pizza with my kids/friends after. Hire some people who can make your customers not feel like they are annoying them.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I come from NY and this is not NY pizza but it's pretty alright. Probably would have rated a little higher if not for the fact that they burned the pizza I mean I could smell it burning for a bit before they finally took it out.< /Text><username>Rudan Gatoe<//username>< response>

Our friends, the Shellenbergers, we miss u guys,  but we are here because you introduce us to this place, my Derek likes it and, we like the sizes and today we ordered an xtra large, I  requested one slice with the works.  Mikko, Cristian and Derek, boys.... all they want is pepperoni, we got fountain soda and the very very nice hard working lady is very down to earth and doing her best.  The price was just right.  Another customer came in but did not have the time, so, she left but came back quickly, another lady and her small child, commented on that their pizza was ready fast and the llady, you are cutting right.  The boys tore up, I did too, all very, very, very happy.<//Text>

I dig this place and am something of a regular.  Solid Italian food with great service from real people.  The wines are reasonably priced by the glass with a solid variety and the cocktails are nice even though I go for wine or for the standard Italian Aperol spritzer.  This is a great place for a dinner with a partner, on your own, or a smaller business meal.<//text>

<Text>My go-to place for a quick bite.  Caprese slice with mozzarella balls, basil, and tomatoes is my favorite!  Adding pineapple makes it even better.  Tried the new orange vanilla coke in a can - tasted like vanilla coke with orange fanta as expected (was hoping it would be more like a dreamsicle...but it is coke).< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< UserId.>

<text>Greco's used to be the BEST pizza in Thousand Oaks, however, the last two times our pizza has been over cooked and burnt on the bottom. I also ordered a salad with chicken and the chicken was over cooked in the microwave to the point it was jerky!!! Of course we called and the girl answering the phone said, "what do you want me to do about it"
Needless to say, we are finished with Greco's...sad< /text>< pics>

This was probably the best experience I've had at a Verizon store. We had multiple issues with the location off of McKinley, but we had quick service, and were able to get everything we needed. We had a great guy named Erik, and he was so extremely helpful with all of our concerns, and he was able to get me the Pixel 3A without any issues. We were so happy with this store, and truly appreciated all of Erik's help</text>

< Review>
After dealing with a Verizon "Retailer" for weeks just trying to get my wife a phone it was really nice to walk into this place. Service was quick, and Jonathan got me out of there with what I wanted within minutes. He also did a great job at helping me keep my monthly bill the same which was my goal from the start. I actually went back the next day to buy a screen protector and some more chargers for my wife's new phone and once again he was there to help out and did a great job once again.</Review>

I was transferring over six lines from my previous provider of 14 years, and Marlo walked me through the entire process and found the best plan that worked for my family. In contrast to the way I felt whenever I made any changes with my previous provider I left feeling great about my purchase.  I needed to make changes to the account the following day and Marlo was there to take care of my families needs with a smile. He spent 5 hours with us due to a huge issue with my previous provider, he kept his smile, was patient and made sure we walked out with all of our needs met.

Got a Moto Z3 with an extra battery pack and a screen protector that I had to purchase and just pay the tax on the phone I believe in order for me to get the cell phone with no monthly payments I went with the unlimited plan on auto pay in order to pay $5 less a month which is going to be $75 from what I was told.. I also got the JBL speaker phone mod which was $80 and I only got it cuz of the great deal I got for my phone plus I was just billed for it which was added bonus to me. Thank you Verizon team.</Text>

It was a great experience did everything I needed to get done for a short speedy visit. I told Erik I had a gym class and I needed to leave asap, he definitely understood and help me get in and get out. I gave him my word the next 2 or 3 devices I am eyeing to buy I will make sure to ask for his help upon my return.  Been with Verizon for 15 yrs now and I still am very happy with their service. I should ask to be on their next commercial lol 🤗. Will ask Erik to help ke put in a request 😆</Text>

I have been a few Verizon stores and retailers before, and this is the best store by far.  The phone selections and service offerings wouldn't be different from other Verizon stores, the difference came from the staff.  The sales personnel helped me was Christian.  He was professional, friendly, and went extra miles to bring the phone cases out from the storage area to show me though he knew I wouldn't really purchase those.  His explanation of pro and cons of the programs were clear and straightforward, it didn't take long for me and my wife to make the decision.  The store management also texted me to follow up,  it was a good gesture of customer support as well.  Many thanks to Christian and the management team!< /text>

<username>Prestige Carsultants</username><Text>Went in after talking to Verizon on the phone and customer service told me I had to go to the store to deactivate a phone and transfer the contract to an open line with no contract on my account. When I went in the sales guy was very rude and said it was not possible. I asked him to call Verizon because notes were left. He said no I’m not calling because it’s not possible. So I asked for the Manager. He also didn’t call for me I had to call and Instead of trying to help he was trying to make a sale.  He also said it was impossible and the guy I called said no notes were taken and it couldn’t be done. Well I called the loyalty number and the first guy I talked to said sure no problem. 15 minuets later it was done and I got a $75 credit. Now I’m going to the corona Verizon to buy a new phone. Lost my business, too bad, it’s next to my house. All they had to do was make an effort and not be rude. Not much to ask for when their business weighs heavy on customer service.</Text>< pics>

Nice, clean store. Customer Service was lacking on our last visit. No one greeted us and only asked if we needed after walking around for 10 mins. Getting an upgrade was quick and easy.</Text>

Called Verizon to discuss upgrade. They said before you chose galaxy note 9 go to your local Verizon and hold the phone(small hands) see what it does and if you like it, then you can decide. So I get off the phone with Verizon and go to the local branch.
You can't even hold the phones,  theyre locked down from top to bottom left to right. An I asked am i able to hold a phone. They said no sorry ma'am..
We'll what's the heck did i just drive down there for. At&t is in the same parking lot so I went there and was able to check out the phone. Thanks for wasting my time verizon< /text>

<review>This was our experience at this store.
We have been Verizon's customers for many years at this location on Eastvale.
On 9/23/18 we went into the store at 6:40pm with the intention of upgrading two of our 10 lines. (We were never told when we came in, that the store closes at 7pm). At 6:55pm, this one guy name ALFRED comes out and with a very rude tone and attitude asked us, "are you guys going to buy something because we don't have anymore time for looky looky. We have to close the store". He said it to us, but loud enough for the other customers to hear.
I had the option to answer back to him in the same tone he used, which I'm pretty sure it would have scalated to a chain of very unfortunate events, so I decided to confront this issue in a more civilized manner.
We have being a satisfied customer for many years, and that's why we have over 10 lines. The problem is not the company itself but this kind of people working in the service industry, without the capacity or will to treat people with respect.
Our monthly bill with Verizon is $600+, equal or greater then this guy's weekly pay, who, based on his way to deal with the authority verizon has giving him shows he has no greater education than high school or a GED, the most.
We expect a response and solution from from Verizon to which we are pretty sure is not an isolated case.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1537907094604, 'text': "Hi Eduardo, I'm sorry to hear about the poor treatment you received at our store.

<Review>About 6 employees in the room that could've reminded future customers and current paying-members that it's the only day of the week they don't close at 8, but 7pm.

It's about a couple minutes till 7pm now and we're seconds away from our new Samsung s9+ but before we could ask for a sales agent, Alfred, man in charge apparently, comes up to us and says that the store is closing and there's no more time for "looky looky" 😂😂
Zero respect towards me and my father. As if we couldn't have been reminded in a different manner??
I told the guy, Alfred, who was apparently desperate to clock out, that we'll just upgrade another day. Assuming he's not too busy next time /:

The male Employee completely disregarded my phone exchange within the first two minutes of me walking in to a completely empty store because I bought the phone online. He said it couldn’t be exchanged. I called Verizon (611) and even gave the phone to the 2nd female Employee and the store Employee told the Verizon representative her system would not allow the exchange without even checking her system. The Verizon representative disagreed with her on the phone and even questioned her. I left the store and Verizon phone support directed me to the Ontario store where my phone was exchanged without any issues or problems. Read the other reviews...customer service here is horrible. I’ll never return to this store again. Ontario Verizon is the place to go if you need help!</Review>

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 is because Claudia is the best person I've ever interacted with. Everyone else at this store is blunt, rude, and won't help you. They claim that there's "policies" that don't allow them to do ANYTHING. I'm sure it's just the manager here because everywhere else does not treat you this badly! Whatever.

< Review>
They definitely put you together i even saw the rep wink at the other rep as he was helping me. I told him tons of times that i dont want to do the edge plan and he insisted and then lied about it. i was there for over an hour and a half and now i have to go back and fix what they lied about. i wish we could give negative stars!!!!< /Review>

Never have any problems at this Verizon store they are always helpful.  It probably helps that it's an actual corporate store, I no longer go to non corporate stores.</Review>

<Text>Don't ever buy ANYTHING from this store especially the Parrot Drone 2.0. It's defective and extremely overpriced. Employees don't know how to perform their job and provide proper customer service and give inaccurate information.  You can't return anything defective or damage,whether it be a phone/accessories/,or this Drone. Store manager Jorge G. Corona and manager Jesus are the most rude people I've encountered,yelling at us in store calling us liars,taking employees word over ours. VERY VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//Text>< pics>

Worst Verizon store experience ever. There were 8 employees and only 4 were helping people. All I wanted to do was pay my phone off to get the S7. I didn't complain or anything I just ended up leaving very frustrated.<//text>

<Text>Went in to trade in my phone. I know these guys work off commission but the rep I had was very pushy. I just wanted to go in and out but we stood there for like 5 minutes straight going over every promo possible to which I replied no to all of them.

When it came down to buying my phone I realized I did not have enough funds on me and when the rep who was working with me heard this his attitude changed to visibly frustrated that he was about to lose a sale. This was my mistake regarding funds but cmon man you’re making the client feel uncomfortable.

I was able to obtain the funds to finish the sale but I felt awkward afterward because the rep didn’t do a good job at hiding his frustration and then tried to turn that into small talk.

The place got remodeled but there’s limited seating area, reps fighting for space to tend to their clients.

I just had an unpleasant experience, which I can’t say has always been the case for me at Verizon, generally they’re good, but I felt uncomfortable this time around.<//Text>< Pics>

Travis and Ezekiel were friendly, knowledgeable, honest with their suggestions to my questions and informative. They got the job done and made sure to clean up after their job, which is super important to me. I highly recommend this company and this team!<//Review>

The two teams that came out were both extremely professional, on-time, and efficient. In addition when they left you would have never know they had been here, leaving everything neat and tidy.<//Review>< Pics>

Door Pros was wonderful to work with. They set an appointment time and  arrived as promised.
Tommy was the technician and he was efficient and very knowledgeable.  He fixed our original garage door problem, then pointed out several things that would be requiring maintenance soon.
Their name says it all!< /Text>

This is a top garage door company.  Professional, on time, reasonable pricing and the nicest people you’d ever want to deal with.  From the owner, to dispatch to installation they exceed expectations. In today’s world where good service is a foreign word I can assure you if your experience is half as good as mine was you’ll be elated.  Make your Life easy hire them for your garage door needs.

Had them out to put weatherstripping around our garage door, etc. to help with sand intrusion.  It was fine until the door didn't work.  Had to have them back out which was "free."  Cost approx. $500 which is way more than anyone else in DWRM has paid.  Then, the door wouldn't open or wouldn't close.  Guy came out, put silicone on it, worked fine.  Then, recently, door opened only part way and then went down.  Had them out twice within less than 6 weeks.  First charge was $80 and second charge was $90 (where they left the garage door partially open at the top as you were using it).  We had it adjusted through our home warranty and then wanted Door Pros to come back and put the door all the way up - the way it had been when they first arrived.  Told them didn't expect a charge.  After 3 calls and more than 2 days - the "manager" tells the woman answering phones that there will be a charge because they are doing work.  What?  You are merely putting the door back to its original position which should've been done when your guy was here.  DO NOT USE this company.  They are all about charging, charging, charging........you know, like bad plumbers.  You can't get an answer on what the charge is, for instance, on the first time they came because it would "be determined upon what they did."  Well.......what?  You've done other houses with the same stuff but they were all charged around $250-$300.  Ours, however, was about $500.  DO NOT USE this company.  Not even sure they know what they're doing but whatever they do - you will pay through the nose for it.  Go elsewhere which is what we are going to do.  Zero customer service.< /text>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1619034604737, 'text': "First and foremost Door Pros does take this claim serious. However, it is very disheartening to see the inaccuracies in this review.\n\nA). Door Pros has set pricing for inside weatherstripping jobs in Rancho Mirage Del Webb, every customer has been charged consistently and fairly. However, in some cases Track Brackets have to be changed out which is a minor cost for each bracket, & in This specific case the customer also upgraded her rollers on the door which is separate from the interior weatherstripping installation.\n\nB) Door Pros performed the installation of the weather stripping in September of 2020, Door Pros returned 9/30 & 10/15 at no charge to the customer to & fixed the issues that arose. The customer door then worked for over 4 months.\n\nC) After months of the garage door working the customer had issues related to the original installation of the garage door (DOOR PROS  Did not install the garage door), The Door Pros Technician performed some service on the springs and cables of the door. (work separate from the previous weatherstripping install) & the customer was charged for that service. The Technician also offered a way to fix the door but since the door was under manufacture/ install warranty the better route would be to have the warranty from original installation fix what was needed. For safety reasons our technician positioned the door in the safest way possible until the door was fixed.\n\nD)Finally, The Customer contacted the Warranty company who came out and fixed the issue with the original installation of the garage door. At that time the customer called us to come back out & expected no charge.\n\nTruthfully, Door Pros is not happy how this experience turned out. In no way does Door Pros want an upset customer who doesn't feel they received the value they deserve. Knowing that Door Pros did not handle the situation perfectly we did offer to come back out rectify the issue but we were declined.\n\nFurthermore, This response doesn't absolve Door Pros or discount the review and feeling of the customer but, we did want to address some inaccuracies in the review.\n\nThank you"}</Response>< GmapID>

<review>We had a great experience with door pros today. Travis was super efficient, friendly and quick. He knew what needed to be replaced and repaired our patio door frame within an hour.
Door pros will be used anytime we need any help with our doors, closets, and/or screens.
Thank you for the great customer service from our first phone call until repair completion!

I had a good experience.  Called for service and got appointment quickly.  Tech (Junior) arrived right on schedule.  Ended up that I just needed a tune up, which he did. I inquired about getting an additional clicker but my unit wouldn't work with a new one.  So I asked about getting a new mechanism.  Got all the info and will likely get one next year.  I called Door Pros because my condo garage had company stickers from previous service. I would recommend this company!</Text>

I needed help with the function issue with my garage door. I looked on line for an appt for someone to check my garage system. I called four companies with no success one did answer and asked if they could call me back.  I called Door Pros and a Tina answered and set an appt for one of their technicians to check my system out. Allen arrived on time he was professional and courteous. Once Allen looked at my door he immediately had a solution and repaired the system in no time. I will be using and reccomending Door Pros to all my friends and family. Keep up the good work.< /review>

<review>Door Pros installed our garage door & opener and we’ve been very pleased with installation.  After 4+ Years, we finally needed some adjustments to our door to keep it running smoothly.  I called Door Pros Tuesday afternoon and they had their technician here the following morning.  The tech, Junior, was on time, very professional and he efficiently completed the repair to our garage door.  It now works like new again.  I would highly recommend Door Pros to install and/or repair your garage door or opener.<//review>< pics>

He found a leak I thought was coming from the garage door opener but it was coming from a bag on a shelf!  I couldn’t be happier to have that mystery solved!!  And he replaced the squeaky rollers so I couldn’t be happier!!!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Over many years, through two or three different home warranty companies, Door Pros has been sent to repair my garage door several times.  They have always been thoroughly professional and friendly.  This last time, I called them directly because I thought my warranty didn't cover the problem.  Door Pros' office suggested I call the warranty company directly and, as it turned out, my warranty did cover most of the repair and, therefor, I saved money - thanks to Door Pros.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I am very pleased with the service provided by Door Pros. Allen was our service tech. He tried to fix my 19 year old opener and when it became clear that it could not be fixed, installed a new opener. It works great and Allen did a clean install. I would recommend this company to friends and neighbors.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Am not many at all, and older than god; these two  young fellows were candid about what I needed for my old, but new to me, older condo windows and doors. They were most pleasant, sold me NO bill of goods, and went about their self-recommends work with ease and efficiency. In addition, I have ordered the replacement screens as needed (not for ALL sliding doors) and told me what to tell my lazy housekeeper to keep things up to snuff before I croak. Am going to use them for my other condos in PS. which are now rentals, with no quotes and just get on with it. Can't say that about MANY of the service companies down here, but this time, I was referred to a winner.< /review>

Busy Door Pros showed up on time, inspected my garage door, repaired it, and serviced it within a short time. The door opens and closes quietly and is properly repaired. Thanks Door Pros, you have been my door expert for over a decade.<//review>

I understand the frustration of my car not opening and closing the garage, especially right after the door was serviced. I have reviewed the call on 4/28 & realize the mistake we made. We should have scheduled a recall to come back out during that phone call. We are reaching out now in hopes to resolve this issue.\n\nThank you again for the feedback\n\n- Ryan\nDoor Pros\nBusiness Manager'}<//response>< user_name>

< Review>
Not a good experience- a repairman came on Tuesday to service our doors and program my wife’s car to open one of the doors
I have no opinion on the service issue
I asked him if the car was programmed and he said yes so I paid him $134
My wife came out the next morning and not only was the car not programmed but whatever he did disconnected her phone from the car
I called the office and they said someone will call me shortly to address the situation
That was more than two days ago and no one has called
I’ll likely use someone else to fix the problem<//Review>

Door Pros is the best! They installed my garage door opener 3 years ago and did a great job, so I immediately thought of them when my garage door came off the track last week. It's wonderful that they text you a picture of the tech who is coming to your house; you can even track them to see how far away they are. Mark arrived right on time and was able to repair the door within minutes. He was very knowledgeable and efficient. I highly recommend Door Pros!< /Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1609368898489, 'text': 'James,\n\nDoor Pros appreciates your feedback. However, please keep in mind that in no way does Door Pros engage in any fraudulent activity. To be clear the call was set up for our technician to arrive between 12pm & 2pm. The Technician arrived at 1:19pm within the scheduled time frame. Furthermore,  Door Pros is a family run business. We 100% conduct ourselves ethically. We are licensed bonded and insured. In this case unfortunately,  not all items are always 100% covered under home warranty polices. The disconnect often happens when an item has to be brought up to code & or the item being replaced is not like for like. In this case & as a  We do in fact understand that in most cases customers are under the impression that a home warranty will cover everything however, they do not. I wish your service went different & your policy was properly explained to you by your Home Warranty Company. I would like to set up a 3 way call with your Home Warrany Company so that these items can be properly explained. Please let me know & thanks again For your feedback.'}< /Resp>< Time>

<Review>Door Pros technician was sent out with a poor understanding of home warranty issues. He indicated the Door pros can only charge for a code change _ back  up battery. I needed a full replacement unit. Belligerent technician late and potential fraud . Notice that the only reviews are on Angies list too many other issue to post here<//Review>< Pics>

Very prompt. He was very professional. Answered all my questions and even gave me some tips to keep my garage motor working effortlessly. I asked him to also fix the rubber on the door he had that in is truck so he added that to the bill. He also helped set up my new app for the opener. It was refreshing to work with  a knowledgeable  and long time owner.</Review>

The repair man was early, very quick working and the door is now so quiet. One of the springs had broken this morning. When I called I saidv I would like to have the regular tune up done and was told that that was included.
The repair man worked quickly and got it done much quicker than I expected, and the biggest and best surprise was that it was less expensive than I expected.
I won't use anyone else .</review>

<text>They replaced the rollers on my large sliding glass door. This door used to pull my arm out of my socket when I tried to open it. Now I can use one finger to move it. They used good quality parts. They also lubricated my two garage doors. They were courteous and on time. My only disappointment is that they would not fix my sliding mirror closet door. They advertise on TV that they do. The service was not cheap but I am very satisfied with what was done.<//text>< pictures>

<text>The technician arrived on time and with advance notification. The notification included a photo of the technician which is a great security feature. The annual maintenance service of my garage door was thorough and quick. It included checking the performance of my two remote door openers. One needed a new battery which the technician had on hand. I would recommend Door Pros to anyone for installation of a new door and annual maintenance. Their prices are very competitive.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dafc3cb0d65d81:0x598802de8c3f5257<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The company had issues with my home warranty (HWA... they’re terrible) but the pushed through and kept me updated through the entire process. I highly recommend Door Pros, especially Junior, for doing an amazing job. I can barely hear my new garage door opening and closing. It’s awesome!   Thank you very much.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>We were having a problem with our garage door but had not yet contacted any service company. Came home and Door Pros was at a neighbors. We decided to ask if they had time to come over and look at our door. When done at neighbors he came over inspected issue and scheduled the work needed to be done just a few hours later. He showed up on time performed the work as discussed in a timely professional manner and was a pleasure to work with.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I couldn’t have been more pleased with the garage door repair service I received from Door Pros. Mark arrived on time and had all the materials he needed to perform the repairs. He was courteous and an all around authentic guy. At each step of the repair he explained what was needed and the costs involved, which were always reasonable. He changed the door rollers, several hinges and the junction of the door arm where it meets the door. The total was a quarter of the amount I was quoted by another company that advertises heavily on our local television channels just to replace the rollers alone! How wonderful to do business with an honest company! I’ll be recommending them to my HOA association as a go-to for garage and slider repair. I’ll also be calling on them for repair of my sliders. I know they’ll do a quality job at a fair price. Hire them and you won’t be disappointed. They were recommended to me by my neighbors.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1567882159768, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review and opportunity.

I highly recommend Door pros as they just saved my Mom $1330 from her 1st estimate of $1650 from a company called Classic Garage Door and Openers. My mom is a senior citizen who lives in Del Web and found that company in the Del Web Magazine of recommended companies. When she told me she backed her car into the garage door and showed me pictures, then showed me the invoice from Classic Garage Door and Openers I nearly about fell out of my chair. I tried finding that company online and couldn't, that was the first red flag. How sad it is that Del Web lets companies like this to prey on senior citizens and that is exactly what I see here. Thank God I found Door pros online. After reading their reviews I scheduled an appointment. They came out the next day, fixed her garage door for $321.92. My mom couldn't be any happier. I'm sure she will be a little more careful backing out of the garage from here on out.</Review>

Door Pros was the contractor dispatched under my home warranty insurance. They were very professional with phone calls text messages and emails to communicate with me. My garage door had a broken spring and i let them know before they came out. The repairman showed up on time and had two new springs and the job was all done in 30 minutes. You want to use them! I couldn’t be happier!<//review>

He offered to fix it or replace it. I opted to replace it as it was 25 years old. He was done by 10:45 with all remotes programmed and working. He inspected the door and made some needed repairs and billed me a reasonable amount. I’m very pleased. And this happened in the middle of a Covid 19 pandemic.

My sliding glass door has been stuck and hard to open since the house was new 15 years ago. I called door pros and they came out and fixed it. Now my sliding glass door opens so easy I can push it with one finger and it glides right opened and closed. If you need a service to your door you cant go wrong with door pros. I also had them look at my garage door sensor that was not closing when the sun light hit the sensor. A quick fix was done there as well. I Highly recommend this company for your door issues. 5 stars all the way.< /text>

We have used Door Pros on several occasions - at our home and our business. They are upfront, honest, and thorough. I really appreciated the text and image I received of exactly which technician was coming to my house. This allowed me to know exactly when they would arrive and whom to expect. Great element of their customer service.<//review>

The first outfit couldn't give me a ballpark price,or a time they could show, next outfit was closed even though they advertise as being open...Luckily I called Door Pros, and I have actually never been more impressed with a service company. Door Pros uses a business model that all other companies should attempt emulate. I called Door Pros and was greeted by a helpful and knowledgeable staff member. She let me know the cost of the service (No bait & switch), then let me know when the technician Giovani would arrive (He did), then I received a text with a photo of him with a bio informing me of his experience. Giovani arrived on time with a courteous and professional demeanor, and immediately got to work with a level of efficiency I have not seen in 25 years of construction management. He finished the job,closed out the paperwork, and payment was simple as well as what was quoted. Follow up via text and email shows that Door Pros cares about their customers service and employee performance. I highly recommend Door Pros</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Junior Rosales was my installer - he called before he came over and introduced himself. He was very courteous, very knowledgeable, very efficient.  He did a great job - He also answered any questions I had and explained what he was going to do and what happened with my garage door - my garage door works better than ever and is very quiet now when it opens and closes.  Definitely would recommend Door Pros and Junior!< /Text>

My 8 foot slider took all my strength to open and close. For a quarter of the cost of a new set of sliders, my slider glides easily in the track. When it comes time  to invest in new doors, I’ll go to DoorPros!< /Review>

All work was done to my expectations. I called
to have my garage doors aligned and it ended up with a repair of $500.00. The repairman showed me frayed wires, hinges broken, a brace only being held up with 1 screw ( the other fell out) and I chose to have the wheels replaced ($150.00) and the new seal at the bottom ($140.00). The door functioning better than before.<//text>

Mark was on time as scheduled and although the  “ noise” from the garage door mysteriously disappeared he replaced the rollers and services the door. Given that the door had not been serviced in several year s I felt this was appropriate. I had the same thing done at my other home and Mark”s price was $100 less. !!</review>

The service provided by Door Pros was beyond excellent. It started with my call to the office staff who were courteous, helpful, efficient & were able to provide a garage door service technician to our home in just a few hours.

Their automatic notification system kept me informed so I didn’t have to ‘wait around’ for someone to show up and provided information about the technician, his whereabouts, & when they thought he’d be there- even his picture for added security.

The service technician, Gio, called us to let us know he would be there in 40 minutes & arrived right on time. He was super polite (& funny too), started to work &  diagnosed the problem immediately. He offered a couple different solutions for a short-term fix and a long-term fix.

Once he was done with his work, he showed us all of the broken parts that were removed, demonstrated the now fully functioning garage door, completed the invoice & payment electronically and was on his way.

I would highly recommend Door Pros based on all aspects of my garage door service call. My car had been stuck in the garage until the door was fixed, & so I was definitely relieved that they could provide same day service. I’ve been thinking that excellent customer service is a thing of the past, but it’s not with Door Pros.<//Text>

Beyond impressed at the service provided by Door Pros.  Not only did the technician fix what 2 other companies fail to find, much less fix, he saved us several hundreds in unnecessary parts. He was early to his appointment AND completed everything before his actual appointment time started.  PLUS, the technician was the owner, Mark Higbie.  I don't know if Mark goes to all new customer calls for service, but if his technicians are anywhere near as professional and efficient as he is, I will never go anywhere else for my garage door needs.  Thanks Mark, you've gained a new loyal customer.

<response>None</response><rate>5< /rate><Text>My garage door would start to close, then open again. I made sure the sensors were aligned and the track for the rollers was clean and it worked intermittently. I called Door Pros and got a very quick response and an appointment set for the next day at a time convenient to me.Junior arrived right on time. His demeanor was friendly, polite and very professional. He showed me the wear on the 30 year old rollers and the worn thinness of the rubber on the door bottom. The rubber was also too short, allowing debris to enter the garage. He replaced the rollers and the rubber and thought he was done but wouldn’t leave until the door was operating perfectly. He did a couple more things I cannot remember but when he pronounced it ready, it was running quieter and smoother and faster than it ever had. I would highly recommend this company and Junior in particular. The price was fair too🙂</Text>< user_name>

Mark, the technician was great, personable and clearly described the problem. Additionally, he offered 3 plans of maintenance, he did not push me to get work done, and was expedient in his completion of the job. The appointment was immediate.

Our garage door would only make terribly loud moans and grinding noises instead of going up. I call Door Pros who worked me into their schedule. Within a couple of hours, the tech was here. He diagnosed the problem, fixed it, oiled the door, advised me and was on his way. The charge was extremely reasonable considering how relieved I was!  Thank you Door Pros!< /text>

Had a new sliding door track installed to replace an old existing one. I wasn’t completely happy with the initial install, but Kyle came out 2 days later and addressed my concerns.< /review>

<pics>None</pics><Text>Terrific service. Eric called ahead to say he was on his way, investigated the problem and demonstrated what he found, recommended solution alternatives and thoroughly explained them, installed a replacement opener quickly, showed me what he'd done and explained the operation, and left me a happy customer (another happy customer, based on the reviews I've read).

And the new door opener works so silently that when I was attempting to close the door from inside the car, I kept hitting the button, raising and lowering it repeatedly, because it was so quiet I thought it hadn't engaged! It's nearly silent. The only problem with that is that I will no longer be warned by the noisy door opening if an ax murder pulls his car into the garage so as to kill me in privacy. It's always something. ;-)<//Text>< resp>

<text>Excellent efficient  reasonable company. I shopped around the desert for a company to install a new garage  side door and frame.  The Door that opens to the yard. Got run around. Door Pros the Only company to call back and come and give me an excellent quote. Kyle came out to install an replace the new door and original door frame was rotted. That was replaced as well. He spent over 8 hours working to do an excellent quality job. Sealing, weather strip, the whole thing. Old school work values. Kyle was an outstanding guy..I was very impressed. Great price on time...quality work..what else can you ask for. And when finished Kyle cleaned up. Excellent,,
The best...Thankyou Door Pros.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The chain broke on my garage opener and it dropped on top of my partner's brand new car!  AHS selected Door Pros to handle my problem.  I called them at about 6pm and told them what had just happened.   "Gio"  arrived at 10am the next morning!  His work and confidence and experience  made us  very satisfied!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My garage door never worked right and was getting stuck open. The technician came and looked at everything thoroughly. He could have just rigged things together like the last two companies did and charge me if money for a job that wouldn’t work well or hold up right over time. Instead he went above and beyond to do it rught the first time!! He recoded my garage , but then he ....fixed my chain that was too lose, put a bolt on that was never put on in the first place as was needed , redid the brackets that were installed originally incorrectly holding up the motor, replaced my wheels (which were being destroyed from the bad install and two bad companies after that not adjusting or doing anything about it !!) and finally put on new desperately needed seal for the bottom. Now I don’t have massive sand blowing into my garage anymore. This has been the best experience I could ever ask for. Not only do I recommend this company to everyone but I think someone would be crazy not to use them every single time period!!!
Thsbk you for all your help, being reasonably priced abd finally peace of mind.< /Review>

<review>Called late in the afternoon. Spoke with an extremely nice individual on the phone. She answered all my questions and gave me a quote without having to pass me on to another person or put me on a long hold. She worked with my schedule to make an appointment. It was a very pain free process. After my call, I recieved a text message and an email confirming my appointment, including all the details and a phone number to call with any questions/issues. Within the time window promised I recieved a text and an email to inform me the repair man was on the way. It included a photo of the person, his name and nickname, his personal star rating from past customers, an estimated travel time to my home and a link showing me where he was on the map. He arrived in a Door Pros truck and greeted me and shook my hand immediately. I showed him the issue. He showed me 2 quotes, one for the job requested and one with additional reccomend work. He explained the additional recommendation.and I decided to address the main issue only. I wasn't pressured into an upsell, nor did he play the "are you sure you don't want to save yourself a future headache" game. He did the work quickly and cleanly and took away the broken parts. The price quoted was the exact price paid. No extra charges whatsoever. Hopefully I won't need any repairs in the foreseeable future but if I do, I'm not hesitating to call this company. I'm extremely impressed with how professional and painless this company made things.<//review>< pictures>
