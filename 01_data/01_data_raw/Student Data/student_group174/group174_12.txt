I wish there was an option for 10 stars! This was the best experience I've had shopping for bras. Clean, I love the ambiance and all of the empowerment accents in the art decoration. Then Crystal (please forgive me if the name is wrong--its been a long day) very professional and welcoming. This business experience quickly turned  into like shopping with your girlfriend. I was fitted quickly, given a bunch of bras to try on and walked out with two purchases and a wishlist item.

Oh and when you walk in she gives you hand sanitizer and a disinfectant wipe for your most touched item (your phone).

I'll be back SOON!</review>

Very cute boutique. Kind of pricey but the quality is there so it's worth it. They have all sizes. I'm very petite and it's hard to find things that fit. The owner let me go through the samples the models wear and I found some really cute things. They were truly one of a kind.< /Text>

It truly helps us as we continue to support and inspire women to embrace their size, and ultimately find the bras that work best for them. Thank you for also pointing out our attentiveness. We believe every client deserves that one-on-one, rare customer service. It’s encouraging for you to notice this- especially when we are booked in each fitting room. Indeed it is a delicate balance juggling walk-ins and appointments. Yet we do it with great joy and only hope the effort is recognized by all of our Bra-seekers. You my dear, have planted such a positive seed to start our day. I believe your fitter may have been Audra. I will pass this message onto her. Kindest regards, Crystal'}</response><text>I visited this store today after some recent changes to my body composition left me wondering about my appropriate bra size.

The woman who assisted me was swift, efficient, and professional, and I could see she was juggling multiple clients while offering us all very attentive and discreet service. The atmosphere was very warm, intimate, and fun, and overall, it's one of my favorite recent retail experiences.

<review>This place is incredible! The thought of going in for a fitting was intimidating but they made me feel completely comfortable. They didn't even poke or prod us like I assumed they would. There was personalized service and the woman was able to look at the label of the current size and eyeball what she thought would fit better and she was right! The pieces they suggested got me out of my comfort zone but changed my thinking — in a good way. I went with my mom and we both had a lot of preconceived notions about what we should be wearing, what we like, etc. and, by the time we left, everything was different. It's actually kind of a life-changing experience. My back thanks me! I can't wait to go back to get more. I've recommended this place to all of my girl friends.<//review><time>1537215213476< /time>< user>

Hands down my go to place. I saw the add on IG and knew I had to go see. WOW was I Impressed. Crystal was incredibly knowledgeable, sweet and more than willing to help me beyond all "measure". I had some special needs and expectations and she was right on top of what I needed. Walked away with 4 items of the 10 I really wanted. With a wish list for the future. For us largely gifted women, it is definitely a need to find the perfect fit. This boutique for sure "fills" my needs and desires.< /Text>

From the moment you walk in you are greeted with a warm welcome. Lucy took the time to explain to my wife and I about bra fitting. She is very  corteous and professional.

The store appearance is great and they have many many designs to choose from. Prices are very affordable and the level of attention is phenomenal. I highly recommend this place...< /text>

They didn't have much to pick from that would fit. The girl who "tried" fitting me was horrible! I'm not sure if she was new or just doesn't know how to fit someone. Really discouraged to go back again. I've been fitted at another place (no longer in business)fitted properly, put the bra on and out the door. Not at this place!!!< /review>

Was it the lack of sizes or did you truly feel that you were miss fitted? Is the bra you purchased fitting you ok? We will have a manager contact you tomorrow if it's ok. We would like more feedback on your experience."}< /response>

Love this place. I got two bra's a couple of months ago and I love them.. I never knew how much a good fitting bra slims you out. The prices are a little high, but so worth it if your a plus size woman... The owner is patient and does a custom measurement. I'll be purchasing a few more soon.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I came here for a bra fitting after hearing about them online and I have not gone to another bra store since. I used to go to Victoria's Secret, but they didn't carry my size in a lot of the more colorful bras. I found such a nice variety at Lucy's and have even taken some friends with me and had them fitted. I strongly recommend this place if you are tired or wearing the wrong bra and want to shop somewhere where they care about you getting the bra you need that makes you feel beautiful and not just selling you a bra that doesn't work.</Text>< pictures>

They made this such a positive experience! I have had so much unhappiness with my breasts and trying to find bras and when I cam here they made me feel so happy and have fun while finding me bras that fit and I loved. The service was so wonderful, and they found me everything so no anxiety looking through the racks.

I love this shop. All of the employees and the owner are so nice and helpful.  Plus their selection is amazing.  You have to buy at least one bra from this store and it will change your life.  This is the only place I buy my bras and underwear from.<//review>

Here at Lucy’s Boudoir, we are a full-service bra-fitting boutique and our number one priority is customer service. For bridal appointments, we have found that it is better for clients to schedule an appointment so that a fitter can spend as much time as needed to find the perfect foundations for a wedding dress. We completely understand how this conflicted with your schedule, at that time we did not have a fitter that could stay later for your bridal fitting.\n\nAgain, thank you for your review; we hope you were able to find something for your big day.\n\nWarm Regards,\nLucy’s Boudoir'}<//resp>
<text>I went here looking for a long bra for my wedding day. Being plus size, it's challenging to find a good bra. This store was recommended by the local bridal boutique I purchased my dress from. I went in on Tuesday afternoon. around 4p. There were  2 other ladies in the store. I politely browsed their selection until they'd been helped. I introduced myself and what I was looking for. The  young lady showed me what she had in stock and then explained I could order custom items. I immediately expressed my interest in ordering. It was at that moment that she lost me. I was now the only customer and she told me I'd have to come back for measurements. When I asked her why ( seeing how I was the only customer in the store by this time) she kindly replied, "we only measure by appointment."  This made ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE TO ME. Had she taken my measurements at that moment, I would have probably bought multiple items ( they aren't cheap). Instead she insisted I come back 3 days later for an appointment. To top it off, her latest appointment was 5pm. Working in OC, I would need to leave at 330 to make it to a fitting on time. The entire experience was both inconvenient and disappointing. I scheduled the appointment but didn't end up going due to work. I would have a expected a reminder call or a follow up call since I missed my appointment, but didn't receive that either. All in all, it's probably okay if you are buying off the rack. Don't waste your time if you are going to special order. They could learn a thing about customer service.< /text><Rate>1</Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>109179676101481497044</UserId.><Name>Andrea Daugherty< /Name></record>

Always fun to stop here. Tasting are free and the sommeliers are so friendly. The tasting room is nice and it's easy to park here too. The wine is also so well priced, and they have a large selection that is not found in stores, I stop here often to get those bottles.< /Text>

This place is amazing and accommodating! Mary Jo is an absolute delight to chat with in the evenings while we were there the past 3 days. The atmosphere was sweet and the rooms were clean. Great breakfast, treats and wine were the best! We hope to stop in the next time we visit!< /Text>

It is also one of the few places that have a free complimentary wine tasting. If you go fancy, they have the $5 list where you try the wines that are not sold in the store. I enjoy sutter home and their people are always nice.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNVQ1py-8op3urLg_hTendQOrEnP0sI7-0mFqF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMinRcyw6A2TJplfuyVHzx4T_TnLXAf75dFn_uK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9y1lSPrlIsmsYKd5K67mnBxeq1vRGytBUkDI4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2tYBSHoa6AiA2XcRvEev1oMF1Dr--GzHaMDkW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ-I4xU8HhVJjDdguphesVp27JGTNwpuTrtQ3c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_AN37d9rdc3z7LiM22rdgBKhEp9U-zMV9lFsP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Rate>4< /Rate></record>

<text>Nice winery in Napa Valley. This is one of the few winery's which offer complementary Wine tasting. Staff are friendly and patient. They have nice garden in the back. They have several types of wine and reasonably priced. Good place to visit for Wine tasting experience.< /text><user>109849026903893201606</user>< pictures>

<text>This was our 3rd winery of the day and by far the best. Just because it is a more economical bottle of wine does not mean it should be passed over. We were lucky enough to have Nathan take us through our tasting and he did not disappoint. His knowledge and love of his job showed through. Kudos to Sutter home and Nathan for such a great visit.< /text><response>None</response><user_name>Nick Vatalaro< /user_name><rate>5< /rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

< Review>
Sutter Home Winery was a favorite among our group. Upgrade to the $5 wine tasting, it is well worth the price. You'll taste limited reserve wines. When you buy a bottle of wine, which we bought several, the fee is applied to the purchase price. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and price of the wines.</Review>

Simone took great care of us. She is very knowledgeable about Sutter Home Wines and the history of the wines and family.
Will always return and hope she is there. I love Sutter Home White Zinfandel Reserve!!< /Text>

<review>Free tastings, great customer service and tasty condiments make this place a must stop for those looking to wine on a budget.

From what I could tell, this wasn’t the vineyard though. That was in a different location somewhere in the valley.

Please note: the more you taste, the more you buy!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Free tasting of the "regulars", or $5 for wines only available at the store.  Paul was great and we had fun talking with him.  Then we bought a few sampler packs and he said "with the sampler packs the tasting is free".  Yeah!<//Review>

I like that it's right to the point here - wine. No fluff as many other wineries in Napa.
Taste, buy then head out.
Free tasting for the lower priced bottle, $5 for a selected list of 5-6 wines including the white zinfandel that I really liked.

There is free tasting of balsamic vinegar and flavored mustard with bread/pretzels. Nice experience and no line/reservation required.< /review>

Probably one of the better tastings in napa- yes you can buy it at the grocery store, but that’s why they are so good! Consistency! The man pouring the wine was excellent. I had the reserve wines and my husband did the free tasting. And only $5 for the reserve tastings which was about 5-6 wines. The also have samples of mustards, oil and vinegar to taste which were all good. Tip-taste the port with the chocolate, it was awesome!< /Text>

They produce massive 10million bottles a year - 22million including the other labels they own. So you can see the scale there. Not an organic producer or anything, but their white Zinfandel is something unique, and Pinot Grigio is not bad either.  You can’t really find much Zinfandel - red nor white - in Europe, so it was nice to visit.< /review>

I’m a truck driver delivering to this winery. I checked in at 5:30 pm, given a visitor badge and told I could stay until my 7 am appointment only to be kicked out of the property at 2 am by a guard following orders directly from Miguel Calderon (Operations Manager supposedly). There is nowhere to park a semi around here for miles. There was no pleading with these people. Never in my long history of trucking I encountered anything like this. It used to be my favorite wine but now I will let everyone know how heartless these people are. No offense to the Trinchero family. I’m sure knowing I had their product in my trailer they would have accommodated. Thanks Miguel Calderon for having me drive around until my appointment time while I could be resting...I will write a letter to the company as soon as I am able as well<//Text>

I have to admit that I made fun of this place for setting cheap ass wine, and to my surprise, it was actually my favorite out of the 4 wineries that we went to that day. The tasting is super cheap or if you buy a bottle (which is super cheap as well), you get the tasting for free. Either way, you win. I like the wines here as they are sweeter and taste more like juice. I love sweet wines (mainly moscato) and this place totally supplied what I was looking for.

Overall, I will never call this "cheap ass wine" again. And even if it is, who cares? It's delicious!</Text>

<Review>You complain an Austrian winegrower family that has been around for almost a hundred years because it has the same name? Who lives on the other side of the world? More American is not possible. If I had not heard of the lawsuit, I would not even know that your company exists. shame on you.<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
I enjoyed my visit to one of California's biggest wineries ... no problems ... but the reason I am not giving Sutter Home a high rating is because the experience felt like it was mass-market and mainstream, as opposed to a boutique or off-the-beaten path kind of experience.  Sutter Home wines are so popular and commonplace that they are served on some airlines in tiny bottles.  I regard their wines as some of the early wines that made California wines famous, but in my experience, people don't buy Sutter Home wines much anymore, except perhaps for big institutional or corporate users.  But I gotta give Sutter Home credit for helping get this industry established and thriving in Napa Valley.  The tour group I was with was given a talk in the building, and then some tastings while standing in a gift shop, and we were invited to step outside (beautiful day) to lounge on the lawn and near the old Victorian house which is adjacent to the tasting room facility.  We did not see any of the other buildings or anything else on the property.  The tasting room building is right up against the busy highway, detracting from any sense of natural surroundings.  Everything was neat, professional, nice and normal ..... but special? ?< /review>

To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Sutter Homes wines. However, the wines at the vineyard made me change my mind. They have ones there you normally won't find in public, and they are much tastier.< /text></record>

<text>While staying in San Francisco, we took a tour of Sonoma Valley vineyards.  We had several wine tastings, from small vineyards to Sutter Home.  We were impressed with all the vineyards.  Sutter Home surprised us in that their wine was very good as compared to the smaller vineyards.  In the past, we thought lower cost meant lower quality and taste, but were pleasantly pleased with Sutter Home.< /text><pics>None<//pics><user>116916608526352597971</user><name>Steve Baker< /name>< date>

The staff and especially guide were very rude and short with myself and a few others in our nappa valley tour group. It was also disorganized as no one was told where to go or given any real information of worth outside of the family's backstory. After a short 10 or 15 minutes we were left by the guide without warning. Will not be visiting again</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Awesome experience for an international author n friends travelling here!  Moscato Sangria n Reserve White Zinfadel (only available at the winery) blew away their typical store stock. Reserve tasting free with purchase! Peter was amazing!  I went there not planning to spend $ (I'm not your typical wine drinker) but the wine tasting experience was THAT COOL that I bought lots of product!   They have a cool wine club to deliver the stuff I like back home on a subscription cuz some of the wines aren't in stores.  Peter was so knowledgeable and so much fun!
Bring all your friends! My chef fiance loved the wine pairings suggested by Peter.  The treats were excellent.  The girls were sweet. They had tasty things to buy and wine accessories that wpuld be an awesone addition to your home.  GO THERE. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.< /Text>< pictures>

We have been here several times and it's a great experience. There's a free tasting for their cheap wines and a $5 tasting for the better wines including the Zinfandel port. Yesica was very helpful and kind. If you sign up for the wine club then wines and merchandise are 30% off which is a great deal. Sutter home includes many brands including Joel gott, menage a tois, seaglass, Newman's own, and many more. If you like sweet wine then Sutter home brand is perfect for you. There's no bubbly here. I recommend visiting the tasting room.< /Review>

Sutter Home has always made good wine for a fair price, and, they also make great wine under their Trinchero Family Estates label.< /review>

Wine tasting is free which is nice for California. They have several wines that aren't distributed and made in smaller volumes that are actually very good.<//review>

BETWEEN THE REVIEWS w/ Rodney S

Q)  Rodney, while you were in Napa, did you experience any wine tastings?
A)  Yes, Rodney, I did!  On my tight schedule, I went to a Grand Pour wine tasting at the Westin Verasa Napa, with the following day a visit to Sutter Home Winery.

Q)  Were there appetizers to munch on?
A)  Rodney, Sutter Home had a sumptuous charcuterie spread to go along with their menagerie of wine, which included goat & sheep cheese, figs & apricots.

Q)  How were the wine tastings, Rodney?
A)  The wine kept flowing to the visitor's content.  So much so, a young woman threw up on the shuttle bus back to the hotel.  I'm not really a drinker, perhaps indulging a couple times a year, so I enjoyed the sweeter libations, like their sangria & sparkling prosecco.  I also had tastings of Sutter Home reserve wine, not sold in stores, such as their sangiovese.

Q)  What else did you do at Sutter Home Winery?
A)  After helping ourselves to charcuterie & glass after glass of wine, we were entertained by a private concert in the round.  Underneath a party canopy, we enjoyed the musical talents of Zach Heckendorf, Brendan James & Drake White.

A fun photobooth provided the poops & giggles

Q)  Rodney, do you recommend visiting Sutter Home Winery for a tasting?
A)  Absolutely, Rodney!  The staff were friendly & hospitable during the couple hours we spent at the winery.  The grounds were beautiful to meander about in & I found a greater appreciation for wine.  Although Sutter Home is considered an economy class wine, the Sutter Home Winery wine tasting was first class all the way.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The Napa and Sonoma region is beautiful, surrounded by vineyards. I especially recommend it in spring, when the vegetation is at its most beautiful, and therefore the views. The most interesting is the route from San Francisco, along the way you can pass objects that inspired the Star Wars director. A trip from SF must take a full day without unnecessary rush so that you can enjoy the beautiful views longer and more ........

Region Napy i Sonomy jest piękny , dookoła winnice . Szczególnie polecam wiosną , wtedy roślinność jest najpiękniejsza ,a przez to i widoki. Najciekawsza jest trasa z San Francisco , po drodze można mijać obiekty , które zainspirowały reżysera Star Wars . Wycieczka z SF  obowiązkowo całodniowa bez zbędnego pośpiechu tak , aby dłużej nacieszyć się pięknymi widokami i nie tylko ........<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Let's forget about our valleys with our alley companies. Let's immerse ourselves in the young American tradition. Sonoma Valley. Good wine presented well in commercial environments, suitable for the coach of people who came down to buy a souvenir, not really a place that remembers the wine shop but the whole package is worth the visit, taste included.

(Original)
Dimentichiamoci le nostre vallate con le nostre aziende vicole. Immergiamoci nella giovane tradizione americana. Sonoma Valley. Buon vino presentato bene in ambienti commerciali, adatti per le pulmante di persone scese per comprare un souvenir, non proprio un abienta che ricorda l'enoteca ma tutto il pacchetto merita la visita, assaggio compreso.</review>

Donuts are good..the helpers not too friendly and i accidentally paid with a 10 bill thinking it was a 1 and they refused to return it. They were not even willing to check at the end of the day to see if they could refund me. They just said they don't remember and did not even seem to care. Not friendly at all< /Review>

The breakfast sandwiches are enormous home cooked creations that are just ridiculously satisfying. Service is always fast and friendly, personable but keep things moving fast to get us in and out for work in minutes. I love this place. Even when the line is out the door, for good reason. Give it 5 minutes and you can walk right in to start the next wave.<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate><userid>110734493656148133268</userid><user_name>Ray Gunaka< /user_name></record>

The donuts were too dense and over the top sweet. Not so light and fluffy like the Luv’n Donuts in Valencia. I’m not sure why this location is so different.<//review>

The donuts are fine and the prices are great but the customer service is really meh sometimes. Usually the cashiers are very dry and they don't smile a lot. I totally understand that it's hard to be upbeat and welcoming at 5 in the morning, but it would be nice to feel welcomed in the store. Sometimes the service is great and thats super cool, and I'm pretty sure nobody is open as early as they are in this entire neighborhood, and for a donut shop they offer a lot of variety.< /review>

Honestly, today's visit wasn't great.  They didn't have many of the advertised flavors of boba drinks, and the cream filming in my donut tasted off.  I've had better experiences other times here.  Guess it's hit or miss.< /review>

We recently moved here and have done a tour of donuts in Santa Clarita... This is my favorite.  They have great apple fritters and maple everything.  The staff is always friendly and quick.  Definitely my top pick.</Review>

Have stopped here many times, yes the donuts are amazing but today the customer service really sucked. The young ladies behind the counter had a very bad attitude and had no clue on the products. I wonder if they have changed owners.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>4.6 out of 5 stars? Seriously? Is that the way people support local businesses around there?

Terrible product, cheap gummy bread, razor thin layer of glaze and a chocolate donut with a bread to chocolate ratio that makes it tasteless. At times I felt I could taste the oil more than anything. Eck.

I don't want to smell a heavy presence of cleaner when I walk in. Not anywhere that makes and sells food. Jesus, I mean thanks for keeping it clean but I don't want to taste the pine sole.

Honesty, I have a lot to say about about the service but I'm not a complete d bag. I'll just say my order in simple slowly spoken English was not fulfilled, the employee seemed distracted. Won't say who or when. Just not good. Not Good.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The place is ok and the donuts are very good on par with the original S&S Donuts on Lyons, especially the raised varieties. It just seems like they could work a little better on inventory I went in at 10 a.m. and the majority of varieties were already out. That's the only thing that kept it away from five stars.</Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>(Translated by Google) Donuts shop correct, without equaling the elites of the pastry way chocolate bread or butter croissant, American cinnamon pastries that are found here are worth the few dollars it will take to eat them with a good coffee.

(Original)
Magasin de donuts correct, sans égaler les élites de la viennoiserie façon pain au chocolat ou croissant au beurre, les viennoiseries américaines à la cannelle que l on trouve ici valent les quelques dollars qu'il faudra pour les manger avec un bon café.<//review>< Pictures>

Zenith Tutoring helped my son achieve his target score on the SAT on the first try. He did a set of 10 private lessons. The tutor focused the lesson time on the reading section of the test, which he had the most trouble with, and she taught him useful strategies to better understand the passages and respond to the questions. This targeted approach helped him use his preparation time efficiently and quickly improved his score. We were very impressed with the professionalism and expertise offered by Zenith Tutoring. We hope to use Zenith again to prepare him for the AP Calculus BC exam!< /text>

Our daughter worked with Zenith on her ACT. What stood out to me is their personalized curriculum that focuses on each child’s weakness and helps that child improve. Tutors Sara and Alexina are phenomenal at the ACT 34+ program. They were instrumental in getting my daughter’s earlier gains. Grayson is exceptional at the perfect score program. He worked with my daughter academically, but also, more importantly, he raised her confidence, and tutored her in a way where she enjoyed learning!< /Text>

Zenith tutoring is simply amazing!!! Grayson worked so diligently on improving my daughter's score this summer (2019) in the perfect score program. I would have never imagined she could get this score of 1570 (August SAT) as she was stuck at 1460 before joining Zenith only a couple of months ago. Zenith is one of the best decisions I have made.

I highly recommend Zenith! Your program is really impressive, one of a unique kind!!  Thank you so much for improving my daughter's score in one summer. She is done with SAT in her first attempt and so glad that she doesn't need to worry about it anymore and can focus on her 11th grade school work. Zenith rocks!!!< /Text>

Our son was one of the first students in the Perfect Score Program last year. After taking the diagnostic ACT and SAT tests at Zenith, it was clear that the ACT was the test for him. He attended 10 sessions during the summer and then took the ACT for the first time in September and got a 36! I had signed him up for the October test in case it was needed, but was so happy to cancel it. Grayson's program worked with our son getting better and better at the test at each session. We were very happy with everyone at Zenith and we will sign up our daughter for test prep at Zenith soon.< /review>

<Review>We had my daughter prepared ACT test in 2016. We have found the approach what Zenith Tutoring taken is the best.  My daughter did great improve in her ACT.  This year we have my son prepared at Zenith as well.  They take the approach  from the cycle of test, review, teaching,  homework and test again. The time is flexible.  The tutors are knowledge.  They provide the similar test environment for the student to take the practice test.  We are very happy with it.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808fb9fe00c2ba03:0xf7c6fc7e4e6331a8<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Zenith's ACT and SAT tutoring programs were game changing in our boys scores. One of our boys got a 34 in ACT after working with them for a short time and the other one got a 1580 in SAT. Zenith's strategies, lesson plans and approach are very unique and very personalized. Their tutors are very friendly, take time to review progress and give very good feedback on what to focus on etc. When they guarantee a score increase they mean it, and it works!< /review>< pics>

Before going to Zenith, my son was not sure if could make his target ACT score. He attended 17 semi-private sessions despite his tight schedule. Within 5 months, he reached 34 in 3 steps. Thanks to Caitlyn for her guidance in improving his reading score.</text>

<Review>Coming into Zenith tutoring, I was unsure of my capabilities in the English sections on the ACT, especially the reading section. However, having Andrew and Grayson as my tutors, not only was I able to quickly pick up the necessary skills to score higher on that section, but I was able to gain the confidence I needed all along.The staff at Zenith tutoring are incredibly helpful, and I want to thank them for making my experience there an enjoyable one.< /Review>< pics>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>Andrew is a wonderful tutor, and helped me especially with boosting my Reading and Science scores in the ACT. Not only did he help me with these two sections, he also strengthened my English and Math sections by fine tuning some of the concepts or question types that confused me. His methods and approaches to problems were really efficient, and he showed me more efficient ways to solve questions (as time was another issue I had with the ACT). I would recommend Andrew to anyone looking in specific for ACT help, because his approaches are individualized, and can help improve scores in the ACT.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Working with Zenith Tutoring was an absolute pleasure. Not
only did my tutor have a gift for teaching, but she was also extremely
patient, engaging, prompt, readily available and organized. I started with
Zenith Tutoring for SAT tutoring in my junior year, and continued with
for AP Calculus throughout my senior year. I am positive that I
would not have been able to pass the class without their help! I could not
have had a better experience working with Zenith Tutoring,
and wish I could have continued my tutoring throughout college in New York!<//Text><Response>None< /Response><user_id>116768678762941354981<//user_id>< time>

<Text>My daughter participated in tutoring with Zenith Tutoring and we were very pleased. The instructors were incredibly knowledgeable, but more importantly, were able to clearly explain very complex concepts so that she could understand them. Her confidence in school improved dramatically.  In addition, she participated in an SAT prep program with Zenith which we believe significantly helped in her test scores.

During my time at Zenith I learned skills that helped me beyond the scope of standardized tests. While the classes I took often had 6 or 7 other students I almost never had to wait for an instructor and felt that the class was highly personalized. The teachers go over every detail with you and don't let you skip the little things. The attention to detail and positive attitude at Zenith is why I often recommend them to my friends.< /Review>

We'd highly encourage you to check out the services of Zenith Tutoring.
They are a reliable, professional organization that made a huge
difference in the lives of both our kids.  We had the opportunity to
use two of their tutors in the subjects of Spanish, Calculus and SAT
Prep.

Zenith tutors are some of the brightest individuals who've worked with
my kids. They know their subject inside out.  But more importantly,
they understand that not everyone learns by the same methods.  They
were highly successful in figuring out where each student needed
specialized attention and were able to deliver the information in a
useful and meaningful way. Both my kids were able to translate the
information back into the classroom, which has led to sustained
academic success.  And I have to say from a parent's perspective, my
most treasured memories of having Mary-Irene and Nuritizi come to our
house were the huge smiles had by all and the tons of the laughter
that occurred during the sessions.  It was by far one of the best
investments we've made for our kids!< /review>

Zenith is a great place for SAT preps and also college admission counseling. Grayson, the director, is very good at teaching math concepts and strategies for conquering the critical reading section.  You don't just show up to classes and passively listen. The teachers give you personal attention and help you with any areas that you struggle with. If you need help with college essays, they also have professional editors that are super good at integrating transitions to make your essays flow more smoothly. I would highly recommend Zenith for SAT preps and other services.

Zenith Tutoring helped me tremendously with a diverse array of subjects ranging from Math to SAT prep to the College Application process. My standardized test scores never quite matched with my grades in high school, and I went to a variety of different tutoring companies to improve upon this. Zenith's knowledge and depth of experience was the only service that helped me significantly increase my critical thinking and test taking skills. More importantly, each instructor valued long term skill development to drive score improvement, rather than be solely focused on short term score increase. Not only was I able to score significantly higher on the SAT's, but utilizing the instructors during the college application process allowed me to be selective with colleges I could have never imagined being accepted to!< /Text>

<Review>Grayson's methodology is fantastic. Instead of just teaching you tips and
tricks, he focuses on really teaching you the material that's represented on
the SAT, and that's the only real way to get above a 2300- which I did! If
you're on the fence about whether or not you want to spend the time taking a
class at Zenith, do it, because it's not just valuable for the SAT. That's
to say that rather than just being good at the critical reading section of
the test, I'm actually a better reader now- Thanks Zenith!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Brad Guesman</name><user_id>116377002407675120046<//user_id>< Date>

<text>For most students, preparation for the SAT can be an arduous process, consisting of countless hours spent poring over vocabulary flash cards, plowing through grammar exercises, and drilling every math concept in algebra and geometry. Zenith tutoring not only breaks this process down into manageable chunks, but also carefully tailors its preparation approach to each student's individual needs.

I came to Zenith with a score in the high 2200 range--something I was (at the time) satisfied with. I believed that I had "maxed out" on my SAT score, and could not go any higher. However, after consulting with Grayson, I decided to retake the SAT in the first semester of my senior year after doing some preparation with Zenith. The results were amazing, to say the least; in just two weeks of SAT prep with Zenith, I managed to push my score to the 2300 range.

Zenith's highly individualized test preparation techniques, combined with its thorough understanding of each section of the SAT make it an excellent choice for any student, whether that student is starting with a score of 1300 or 2200. I was highly impressed by the knowledge and friendliness of all the tutors, and I would strongly recommend Zenith to any student looking for the best tutor he/she can possibly find.<//text>< Pictures>

This place helped me a lot in achieving an 800 on SAT Math 2. After tutoring at this place, my ACT score also went up to 35 which I thought was completely impossible.< /review>

<Text>My son had a great experience at Zenith Tutoring. He took the group classes and Laura helped him improved his SAT score by not quite 400 points. Their structured environment and system is effective and teachers follow-up on their students regularly. We would recommend Zenith Tutoring to any students.
Thank you so much.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Zenith tutoring really taught me how to tackle the SAT systematically and got me over that wall I had hit at 2100. After talking the 2300 guaranteed class with Grayson, I felt confident with every test I took. In the end I scored a 2350 and could not be more thankful. I would recommend Zenith tutoring to anyone who feels stuck or just need a push, because the Zenith team can make a dramatic change.<//review>

<review>I took the class that was a bit more self-paced which was very helpful to me in creating a more unique SAT prep experience. Zenith really helped me improve my math score, which was my biggest concern. Overall they have a huge amount of resources available: lots of practice tests, great explanations, one-on-one tutoring, etc. I got a 2330 on the SAT and was very satisfied with my experience. Thanks Grayson!< /review><GmapID>0x808fb9fe00c2ba03:0xf7c6fc7e4e6331a8<//GmapID></record>

My daughter's SAT score rose 300 points after Grayson's classes which opened up many college opportunities.  We liked the iterative approach, the homework assignments and quizzes to ensure content is being absorbed, and the tailored guidance he provides each student. Lilly, one of their college coaches, did an outstanding job advising on college essays, guiding each one based upon her deep experience.  Highly recommended.</Review>

It is not an exaggeration when I say that anyone can close their eyes and enroll into Zenith tutoring! The experience Grayson and his team showed in getting a 35 out of 36 in ACT for my son was really overwhelming. My son initially got a 31 in ACT but the able coaching from Zenith tutors made him get a  score of 35. I highly recommend anyone looking for an excellent coaching centre to end up their search here at Zenith.< /text>

This review is a bit delayed, I highly recommend Zenith Tutoring. It helped both my kids succeed and do well on their tests. I first used Zenith Tutoring in 2013-2014. My son took an ACT class with Grayson as his teacher. Grayson took interest in my son's learning and progress. He made the process very personal, teaching in a way that worked best for my son. They worked to improve his scores and test taking abilities better than any other test taking book or class. The materials provided by Zenith are outstanding. Seeing the amazing improvement my son had of course I  contacted Zenith again for my daughter. She not only improved her act scores to near perfect (36, 35, 35), she had help on her essays and is now a freshman and a top University out east.

There are a lot of good tutoring options out there. Zenith, however, is great. The care and dedication these instructors give is outstanding. They really care about the kids they are helping.</text>

After a long search for an SAT tutor for my daughter, and a couple failed attempts with bad private tutors, I figured there must be a better way. And Zenith is that better way. They combine a process of live classroom help, but they also mix in pre-recorded video tutorials, which are used in and out of class, and the classes are very small group sessions. My daughter didn't really want a formal structured class, but wanted help where she needed it. This was the perfect balance. My daughter greatly improved her SAT score after committing to Zenith, and it did take a commitment of course. Zenith is proof that new tech-based approaches to learning need to become an education standard.<//Text>

Zenith helped my son achieved perfect scores for both SAT Math II (800) and ACT (36) in one attempt. For Math II, my son scored a 720 on the initial Zenith practice test and with only 2 private sessions with Zenith (+several self practice tests), he nailed the 800. For ACT, my son was in the perfect score program where the owner Grayson taught. Grayson focused on the areas that my son needs attention and introduced strategies that worked. Per my son, Grayson knows the standardized test very well and was targeted in his approach. Zenith has a complete library of videos which provides clear explanation of topics in the test. Not only did my son learn test taking strategies, he also learned how to learn from his mistakes. Grayson's encouragement to my son also helped boost his confidence, in all, Grayson's help is critical in my son getting the 36. I highly recommend Zenith for test prep. Thank you, Grayson!<//Review>

My sister and I have been using Zenith tutoring for a couple of months now to prepare for the chemistry SAT II and to help us with our chemistry homework. Our tutor, Gary, has been extremely helpful. He is very knowledgeable and explains concepts in a way that is easy for us to understand. We have seen improvement in our test scores and school grades since we started with Gary. We highly recommend him as a chemistry tutor!<//text>

Working with Zenith tutoring was a fantastic experience. I accredit my
ability to succeed in the rigorous Menlo Honors math program to my
time studying with Zenith. They taught me the valuable skills of
patience in problem solving, confidence in my mathematical base, and
the drive to understand every new concept in full depth. I recommend
Zenith to anyone, of any proficiency in mathematics.<//Review>

<time>1381361617292<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I came to Zenith after my mom found out about it through various other internet websites and was thrilled with my results even after the first few weeks. I started with a score in the mid 1500s and improved about 400 points in just over two months. When I got to Zenith, they were very welcoming and encouraged my success. They told me if I studied long enough at it, I could eventually get to a 2300+. At first, this seemed a little far fetched to me, but after I took their two-week long course, I started to believe it was possible. They have a very unique and successful approach to improving your SAT score that has definitely worked on me. If you are looking for an excellent tutoring company for the SAT and/or many other subjects or help with college applications, this is the place for you. Oh, and it's cheaper than most other tutoring companies and does a great job and everyone is super nice.<//Text>< pictures>

Words can not express how grateful we are for your help with the SAT. Our daughter worked very hard over the summer and with your direction and guidance improved her SAT score from 1910 to 2030 then to 2320- just fantastic.. We were dancing around the kitchen when we got her score back.
Thank you very, very much. In another couple of years we will send you our 3rd child to work your magic with as well.</Review>< Rating>

Zenith Tutoring is awesome! I started working on my college applications in May of my Junior year, and Zenith made the process so much easier. Not only did the tutors thoroughly understand the admissions process, they were also very helpful in time management and essay writing. At the same time, however, I have the comfort of knowing that the essays I wrote were absolutely my own words. The staff here are extreme perfectionists, and I’m grateful for all the time they put in with me; they went above and beyond my expectations. I am now in the great position of choosing between four of my dream schools: USC (with Presidential Scholarship!), UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Pomona.<//text>

I began going to Zenith for SAT prep my junior year of high school. With the help of the enthusiastic tutors, I was able to get my SAT score to a whopping 2230! Earlier, I was having troubles raising my scores past the 1800s at other test prep centers. Luckily, the tutors at Zenith worked with me thoroughly through each section of the test. They work hard to make sure no question is unanswered, revisiting previously taken mock SATs with students and going over any incorrectly answered question.

The tutors are extremely dedicated to their students and strive to see their students improve. All in all, the environment at Zenith is one different from other test preps; it’s a place I actually want to be at!<//Review>

I went through multiple courses looking for the perfect tutor for SAT or ACT: one day courses, group based lessons, individualized coaching sessions, and classes where I consistently took the test every week. With each of these courses neither my score improved nor did I feel that I had learned something from this process. Unlike other places, Zenith puts a lot more effort into helping the students help themselves. Every other company or strategy I’ve tried has taught me in a much more formal way: the tutor giving a generic lesson. Zenith individualizes each lesson. They specifically honed in on the issues I was facing, for example I struggled on purpose of piece questions in the English section or with a confidence boost before an exam. To actually see my ACT score increase from 32 to 34, I was ruthless about finding my mistakes, I spent hours each week completing the homework applying the strategies, my mentor had given me,  for conquering the critical reading section. Zenith provides with the highest quality practice materials and great mentors.<//Text>

<review>There's no secret, patented formula for obtaining a high SAT score, and there's definitely no one-size-fits-all teaching method that will make students do well. Unlike other companies around here, Zenith Tutoring understands this. Throughout my time there, the tutors were able to pinpoint what I understood and what I didn't. Their ability to identify my weak points and work on them with strategies tailored to my thinking resulted in consistently sharp score improvements in increasingly small periods of time.

I'm no genius, but I got a 2300+ SAT score on my first try (taking the official October 2011 test) thanks to these people. The first practice tests I ever took fell into a range between 1700-1900, so it can confidently be said that my score improved by *at least* 400 points over the course of about three months. Having previewed other tutoring companies around Palo Alto before choosing Zenith, I am of the opinion that Zenith's superiority comes from their extremely personal teaching methods, adaptability towards the student's learning/thinking style, well-developed proprietary resources, and downright vast experience.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< name>

< Review>
I highly recommend Zenith Tutoring. Our daughter wasn't able to start studying for SAT until the summer before her senior year. Her initial score was 1790. We weren't sure how much she can improve her score in such a short time. Fortunately, Grayson and Joyce were great and so efficient in covering the material and strategies while focusing on the areas that needed more improvement. Their method is also successful because they believe in their students and what they can accomplish.

When our daughter took the test in October, she was able to move up her score from 1790 to 2240 (a 450 point improvement).

Thanks Grayson and Zenith Tutoring.<//Review>

A big thank you to Grayson’s team at Zenith, our son earned a composite score of 35 for his ACT.  He attended the semi-private ACT under the 34+ guarantee program. Unlike other ACT prep courses that are one-size-fits-all, our son found the Zenith program to be extremely effective.  He learned to manage his homework portion (practice tests, cheat sheet and tutorial/test taking strategies video series) before scheduling the in-class session with his mentor. The class instructions are very streamlined and personalized, focusing on errors and identifying any knowledge gap. For example, after reviewing and analyzing his mistakes, Grayson gave my son a tutorial on trigonometry and his Math score improved significantly. He is very grateful to Andrew Sutherland for his English score which improved to 36. I highly recommend the Zenith program to any students.< /Text>

<Text>I love that zenith isn't just about the tricks but that it teaches you ways to fundamentally approach problems. I learned a lot more than how to do well on the SAT there - I became a smarter and more confident test taker overall. It's clear that Grayson and the people at Zenith do extensive research and really want to see kids succeed.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My daughter went to Zenith in her junior year. Grayson has been really helpful to prepare her for SAT. She set her goal at 2300 and she exceeded that. We are all very happy she achieved her target score, which is a big improvement from her first diagnostic test. Grayson's method is to help students understand the contents of the test, not just applying tricks. After SAT, students' English skills are also improved. We are very grateful for Grayson's efforts. Highly recommend Zenith!<//Text>< Pics>

<username>Amit Nagar< /username><pics>None</pics><text>Our experience at Zenith Tutoring has been extremely positive.  Our son did  the SAT prep at Zenith,  improved on his test taking skills, knowledge and  did very well on his SAT exam.

In our son's words, Grayson does not simply teach you tips and tricks to score better but explains things in a way  that fundamentally changes the way you analyze problems. He felt he could use these skills at school in other areas as well.

Our son was able to relate to Grayson and  found him very approachable to ask any question he wanted to help understand the concepts in depth. As a parent I found Grayson was very patient in listening and was extremely  flexible in adapting to our needs.

We plan to continue to use Zenith Tutoring for other areas as our son progresses through his educational journey.< /text></record>

<Review>I was referred to Zenith through a family friend's son that would spend a lot of time at Zenith simply to study in a friendly learning environment.  I contacted Zenith for private one-on-one SAT prep tutoring.  After a very informative meeting with Grayson, to my surprise Grayson suggested a two week group session that was a lot more cost effective.  It is hard to find an a tutoring organization willing to pass up on a high rate of private tutoring due to their deep committed to a well proven strategies.  My daughter's SAT score improved significantly.  We really owe this improvement to Zenith and their professional approach to teaching.  Grayson created an amazing sense of empowerment in my daughter and removed all doubts about getting a perfect score.   The constant reassuring from Grayson that high scores are really achievable and is a matter of effective understanding of the content and effective practice was an amazing positive force.  The mind numbing SAT practice tests are difficult to endure and I really believe that Zenith has a irrefutable and positive approach that is very effective to address these taxing exercises.  My daughter's study skills and sense of confidence was improved overall as well. I checked my daughter's test scores, reviewed their materials and followed their conversations.  I genuinely appreciate Zenith solid systematic approach in, they are efficient and built on solid and organize strategies that really help students.  We were very happy with all of their services will continue to recommend them< /Review>< date>

I wholeheartedly recommend Zenith Tutoring for SAT preparation/review. The approach is uniquely Grayson’s and the results are outstanding. There is no replacement for hard work but with Grayson’s help, we've achieved the targeted score (2300+) as planned.

With many talented tutors and a highly effective approach, Zenith is probably the only tutoring service in the Bay Area offering Guaranteed Score programs up to 2300+. Thank you, Grayson; and I hope that other parents (and their children) will find you and Zenith in their quest for achieving top SAT scores and academic success!< /Text>

<text>When my October 2015 scores came out, I was overjoyed to find that I got a 2310 on the SAT reasoning test. Because of Zenith, I was able to develop in my weakest areas and feel confident in myself on the day of test. In fact, I went from a 700 in writing (previously my weakest section) to an 800.

While its score guarantee is appealing and the class really does provide students with the resources to achieve their desired scores, Zenith's advanced class ultimately gives you what you put into it. To ensure the 2300+ score guarantee, Zenith requires students to maintain a 90% quiz average (such quizzes are given weekly in class and test strategy knowledge and vocab). If a 90% average seems hard for you to attain, don't worry. If you study a lot and still aren't quite breaking 90's on quizzes, chances are you're still retaining the strategy knowledge necessary to crack 2300 on the real test. This was the case for me.

Zenith provides a huge arsenal of resources for its students, including dozens of practice tests, exhaustive strategy guides for each section, and online explanation videos for hard test questions. As a student in the advanced class, you will be expected to work hard. My class met for three hours every week for eight weeks (I believe there are other timing options, but I'm fairly sure all advanced classes meet for 24 total hours), and required around 6 hours of class-related homework per week (for me 4 hours was the least in a week, 8 hours was the most).

So yes, the work is pretty grueling.

However, my class teacher, Grayson, who also owns the company, was a big help. Class time always flew by surprisingly fast because he used the time so productively. Grayson helped me become more confident in my critical reading analysis skills by grilling me on the questions I got wrong, telling me to find the evidence in the passage, because, as I learned, the evidence is always somewhere in the passage, you just have to look. Grayson motivated me to be smart, study hard and "beat" the SAT, and for that, I am very grateful to him and highly recommend him if you choose to attend a Zenith class.

My parents and I were and still are very satisfied with my score and we have Zenith to thank. I don't know where I'd be without Zenith :~).<//text>< pics>

Zenith tutoring helped my daughter to adequately prepare for the SAT.
The strategies she learned were beneficial in helping her raise
her test score by 400 points.
Grayson ensures excellent customer service.

There is only one word to describe Zenith Tutoring: extraordinary! Grayson’s advanced SAT class and individual tutoring helped me go from a 1890 (1st diagnostic) to a 2350 on the real test! Grayson’s classes were always engaging, and he made studying for the SAT fun! When I started out, critical reading was my weakest section; by the end, it became one of my stronger ones. Grayson constantly helped me, teaching me new strategies and ensuring that I understood them completely. With the uniquely effective strategies, I was able to get a 790 —a score I didn’t know I was capable of— on the critical reading section. Thanks Grayson for all your help!

I highly recommend Zenith Tutoring.</Text>

< Review>
My son is good at math but has real challenges in the reading/writing parts of exams.  As a result he did poorly on those sections of the SAT exam.  For months we encouraged him to work on this and while he is a smart kid, he has a procrastination problem and never seemed to get around to applying himself.  We spent a year with another (more expensive) tutoring service but saw very little progress in several attempts at the SAT.  At the end of his junior year we decided to make a change and chose Zenith after reading reviews and talking to Grayson.  The first thing they did was to spend a couple of days with him to prepare for the impending SAT subject tests.  We were very pleased to see that after this preparation he scored an 800 on the Math II test and a 770 on the Physics test.

Grayson then recommended that our son could best overcome his reading/writing weaknesses by studying for the ACT instead of the SAT and assigned Lynn Tsai to prepare him for the ACT and to help him with his college applications.  Lynn worked diligently with him over the summer and fall and somehow got him to really prepare for the ACT test.  This resulted in an increase in his ACT score from 29 to 33.  Lynn also worked with him to develop compelling essays for his college application and spent a full day with him in the Zenith offices to go over the application to his first choice college.  Almost all of the tutoring sessions were done on Skype and looking back I think that the scheduling flexibility of Skype allowed them to have their sessions at times when there was less distraction.  She also sent him a written “to do” list for the next session minutes after the last session ended.  Throughout this process Lynn kept us informed on the progress he was making and when he was not making progress.  We were extremely pleased and grateful to Lynn when he was admitted to Johns Hopkins in December on an early decision basis.

Having tried another prominent tutoring service before we found Zenith, I have no reservations in recommending Zenith, Grayson and Lynn.

< Review>
I am a straight-A student and as a result I already had a pretty high SAT (2050) and ACT (32) score when I came to Zenith Tutoring. However, thanks to Grayson, I managed to increase my scores to 2250 and 35, respectively, after only a month of tutoring. What makes my SAT score even more impressive, is that I had a horrible headache during the second half of the test and was practically guessing on the last few sections.

Grayson is unlike any other tutor that I have ever met. He truly believes in your success and will not stop until you get a perfect score on EVERY section. When I first took my SAT I got a 590 on the reading section. After a summer of learning vocab and reading through countless SAT Prep books (6, I believe) I managed to raise it a mere 30 points to a 620. Needless to say I was unhappy, but I was never good at English anyway and eventually came to terms with my low score. Consequently, when I came to Zenith Tutoring I told Grayson that there was nothing he or I could do about my Reading score—I was already at the top of my reach—and that we would be better off focusing on Math and Writing. Thankfully he didn't believe me. Today I am the proud owner of a 770 Reading sub-score, an unfathomable amount that I could have never even have hoped for.

I could see a similar trend in the scores of the other students in Grayson's SAT class: people with extremely low reading or writing or math scores, people who would have been happy with only a 700 on that particularly hard section, managed to get close to, if not exactly, a perfect score.

Finally, unlike any other tutors that I tried, in Grayson's class we always started on time and were working for the entire session. There were no "tell me about yourself" questions that last for half an hour or long anecdotes that had absolutely nothing to do with my SAT/ACT. Every second of Grayson's class was spent on track.

I would definitely recommend Zenith Tutoring to anyone who wants to get a good score on their SAT, ACT, or simply need help on a hard AP class. And I will surely be coming back to get help with my college application essays.<//Review>

<Text>I'm a high school senior and I've always had problems with math.  But last year, I got the second highest grade in my trig class and in my physics class.  How was that possible?  Because I had Grayson as my math tutor and Will Bassett as my physics tutor!  Each of them found a way to teach me the material - they were really patient about explaining the concepts and making sure that I understood the ideas.  They were really patient and very encouraging.  I would get frustrated, but they never did.  I think the most important thing was the confidence they gave me.  Grayson is tutoring me  in calculus now.  My calculus teacher, who teaches three calculus classes, just congratulated me for getting the highest test grade out of the three classes.  I couldn't have done that without Grayson's help!

When my parents saw how well I was doing with the Zenith tutors, they asked Grayson to prepare me for the ACT.  The hardest part for me was the writing
component.  Grayson helped  me to strategize and really calmed me down.  I received a score of 11 out of 12 on the writing component….I was shocked!

My mom wants me to add that she has referred other parents to Zenith - and every parent has told her that their child substantially improved grade-wise or on their test scores.  She will always refer people to Zenith if they ask her for a good tutor.

Thanks Grayson, Will, and Zenith Tutoring!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am an educator with over 30 years of teaching experience, but when it came time for my son to prep for the SAT and ACT, I knew he needed help from someone other than me.  We had quite a few false starts as other programs and tutors seemed to have a set program that was not individualized to meet his needs.  We were quite frustrated as he did not have a lot of time to devote to test prep when a friend recommended Zenith. Although my son did not need the promised 5 point gain on the ACT, he did need to improve a bit so he took the summer class which consisted of eight sessions, three hours each, over the course of two weeks. When he took the test almost two months later, I was not sure that he would remember what he learned.  We were thrilled to receive his results where indeed he had a 5 point gain, with a perfect score in math and a nearly perfect score on two other sub-tests and a composite score of 34.  I have been truly impressed by the program at Zenith, the ability of the instructors to meet students' individual needs, and most of all by the results!  They have my experienced and highest recommendation.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They have great service. The staff is friendly and they serve you quickly. The food is tasty. When we got our soup it was piping hot. The prices are reasonable.

<review>Great first time experience!! The food was delicious and the service was super favorable!!
I got to try the creamy ramen, Sesame chicken, fried oysters, and shrimp tempura! Also, for dessert I got to try the ice cream sandwich which was also very good!! If you are looking for a little hole in wall this is it! It's a genuinely a hearty home ramen place . Owned by a sweet wholesome elderly gentleman! I got to come back and try the other stuff they have on there!
Support your ma and pa shops! They make their orders with love and care so please in return give them your love and support! The orders might take a bit, but it's because it's only two people working. They are both doing their best. Thank you for your great service! I took pictures too! To share with you all!</review>< Pics>

Lots of selection on the menu. When I went there, everything was 50% off. I liked the broth and the fact that there are several noodle types, but thought y noodles were a bit over done. Regardless the pictured Stamina Ramen,
which is Shoyu based broth has  Shrimp tempura, Korean style beef, kimchi, egg yolk, sprouts, green onions, corn, fish cakes, seaweed, menma. Also pictured is a side of chashu pork. It was cold side which I added to the broth as I ate which warmed it up. The pork was a bit tougher, but very flavorful. It took a bit of time to get my order out but the server was very nice and helpful enough with the menu.</Review>

I’ve tried other ramen places but this one by far is the best here in town! Owner is super sweet and the waitresses have the best customer service!

<Review>Best Ramen in Fresno, hands down. The people running the place are super friendly, and the chef really knows what he's doing. Even the pickiest ramen eaters will love this place. Only downside is that it's super hot when dining in, but with the COVID thing making it takeout anyway, it's not an issue right now.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

All the noodles taste the same: like seaweed and salty. They all have a miso soup taste to it. Beef flavor doesn't taste like beef. I ordered that side order thinking it was going to be Korean style beef, but false advertising. It was more like taco meat, asada for $5.50. Wow, I could have gotten a burger for that much. Sorry buy not worth it at all, check my other ratings for best Ramen place in Fresno.<//review>

The food was really good, looks like it does in the pictures.  Yet, my wife ended up with a baby cockroach on her arm and we saw another on the ground.   The waiter gave us the check about five minutes after she gave us the food and kept walking towards our table to see if I paid yet.  Got tired of it and felt rushed so I gave her my card.</review>

<Text>Very nice service. Family owned. Went here with my little ones and they all loved it. It was their first time having ramen. We had the egg rolls appetizer, wonton ramen, and the pork ramen. We all devoured it. The kids asked if we could return. Food was reasonably priced.< /Text><response>None<//response><rating>5< /rating>< Date>

Exceptional service! They brought the children food first to occupy them. They even had my son grind the seasame seeds at the table for our Ramen. The food was great! Good selection of differant Ramens broths. TV set to Americas Funniest Videos so not too annoying.< /Text>

The Soup & noodles was good... my beef was alittle over cooked so it was kinda hard... but I didnt mind... but while me & my lady was eatting we saw a roach crawling on the wall then it went to the chair next Me... I didnt care much lol but my wife was  Disgusted by it... do we called the waitress to come & we explained to her what we saw... but it didnt bother her so I still paid for my food & when we left the waitress looked at the table to see if we left a tip really!!!<//Text>

The takoyaki tasted great. The waitress was really pushy and did not wait to understand what we were asking. She gave my wife the wrong order (chicken ramen) but luckily it was better than the Tonkotsu ramen that I ate. Overall my bowl needed salt and chili oil in order for it to taste good. When we were given the bill I noticed that they were both two dollars more than what was on their website. She showed us that on their menu they increased their prices but failed to reflect it on their website. I also noticed that they changed their layout for the restaurant. Where they took out the bar and replaced it with an old man taking up a corner of the restaurant and using it as an office. Where he stared at us while we ate. Not eating her again.</review>

<Review>The original, but second to their location on Shaw! They have a great selection of traditional ramens to choose from, including vegetarian friendly. The service is always great, and the food is always good. Portions can sometimes be a little skimpy, but other than that,this place is great!< /Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1</rating><review>It was once my favorite place in town for ramen noodles but not any more.  Cockroaches were found running in the dining area in the last few months, which I didn't care much until they were crawling on our table in our last two visits.  The soup of my seafood ramen noodles was not hot, the meats, fish balls and veggies were still cold inside.  Clams and mussels were not fully cooked.  There was even a small piece of newspaper/wrapper found in my noodles. It made us wonder if there were no cockroaches in our food or they had already been eaten.  Obviously, the owner is doing everything he can in running himself out of business.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Best place so far. Someone said this place is not los friendly but I take my kids here. They love it. They have high chairs and if you ask for a bowl on the side for the kids they do since this bowls are big. Love this place.</Review>

Walked in with my wife and daughter and was stared at by customers who were already there, as if we did not belong. As we walked by everyone feeling very awkward we finally were greeted by the waitress who went to the back, then came out and said "sorry were closed"  The sign outside says they close at 9:30pm, not only that, the "open" sign was still on and the cooks were still cooking in the back. I asked the waitress "but why does it say 9:30pm is closing time?" She responded as if she were making up a lie to not hurt our feelings "sorry, he, the manager said, he's changing the closing time again" Mind you, we walked in at 9:10pm. I'm still sitting outside and everything is lit up and people are still eating and its 9:26pm. Was I just refused service because of my ethnicity? This would have been my first time trying this place, but because of this experience I am never coming back. Thanks "Ramen" for reminding me that the color of my skin or my ethnic background does play a role in receiving quality service. If that's not the case, then  Thanks for the horrible hospitality and bad attitude!<//text>

The ramen noodles are thicker and chewy. The soup is flavorful. There is not much chasu on a regular order, so you may want to order extra. One nice touch is that they gave me crushed sesame to garnish my tonkotsu ramen.<//text>

I've been here before service was usually fast and the food decent. But I will never go back after tonight. I went with my family. They were busy, we were seated, we ordered, they made me the wrong food. I didn't complain. What they brought me was an Oyaku don with egg, chicken, mushrooms, onion etc. What I ordered was a chicken cutlet. I don't eat soft, runny eggs. I hate them. But I didn't send it back, I gave it to my husband and just didn't eat anything. Our check, when it came, said chicken cutlet which is more expensive than an oyaku don. I politely pointed out to her that I was brought a different dish and I'd appreciate the price adjustment. She adjusted the price, we paid and tipped her, and then she started running her mouth. Trying to say that I'm trying to cheat them because a chicken cutlet comes with egg. I didn't argue with her. But I lived in Japan for 2 years. A katsudon does not come with egg. And if you look at their menu, what I received is the exact description of the oyaku don. I don't appreciate her trying to make me out to be an idiot. She doesn't know me. And her cook was wrong. If anything she should have been yelling at him, and if she was a good waitress, she would have noticed she had brought me the wrong dish to begin with. Not my fault she doesn't know Japanese food. I'd post pics of proof, but I'm on a mobile and I don't see a load button. Anyway. Don't order a katsudon if you don't want egg. If you want good Japanese food, try Oka's off of Bullard and West.< /Review>

<text>Had the tonkatsu ramen. Good broth, noodles were thick and had a good chew to them. I would have preferred a soft boiled egg and chasu that was a little more tender. Great service from the wait staff. I would definitely come back again.< /text>< pictures>

Eat here every time I get the chance.  Come here early if you want dinner it is usually busy. Appetizers are great love the shrimp tempura and gyoza is pretty good too.  Pork broth is my favorite the Tonkatsu ramen is usually my go to bowl with extra cha siu< /text>

<text>I only had ramen here so I can only comment on it. The broth was ok, nothing to rave about, noodles were firm and had a nice texture, ramen didn't come with an egg so I had to get an "extra" and I was disappointed that it wasn't marinated, it was broiled egg breaded in panko so it was a bit messy inside the bowl. I might try the sushi next time.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>Considering this is Fresno, this isn't a bad place to get ramen.  The broth is decent.  However they do overboil the egg.  It's overcooked hardboil to where it's grayish at the edges of the yolk.  However, this might be a culture thing as many American's are not a fan of runny yolks.  The Tonkatsu Ramen is decent, however I feel like it could be amazing if they had a proper softboiled egg and a richer deeper flavored broth.  Not bad for Fresno though.</text>< pics>

Family dollar can be considered a Mini Wal-Mart as it has your variety of home items, goods and foods but does not a offer a great  selection. For this particular Family Dollar, depending on the time you get there it can be a long line at checkout. They've only had one register running many times that I've been there.< /Text>

I dread going to this store there's always a big line to check out and the employees seem like their not very happy to be there, plus rude most of the time anyway. This store definitely needs a new set of people to work there.<//Review>

<username>Andrew M</username><date>1612902334277<//date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Very good service when either ordering parts over the phone or online and I'm fairly sure in person. They inform you if the part is there or when it will come in. The gentlemen behind the counter are always very helpful and seem to go out of their way when I hear them obtaining or identifying parts for other customers. They always have parts I order online and are generally very nice and knowledgeable people to do business with.
Easy 5 stars from me.< /Review>< Pictures>

They have had some staffing issues of the years, but the counter has been staffed pretty good lately.  Louie my sales rep always rake care of my concerns and has a great attitude.  Huge inventory in stock and if the don't have it it can be ordered from another store.< /text>

What's not to love about napa auto? The only place to go for truck parts. I haven't owned a car in twenty years, but if I did I'd get regular car parts there too. The staff here at the Oakland branch is friendly and helpful, which is almost strange for an Oakland business.< /review>

Worst place ever I went there to get a coolant reservoir for my volvo that I ordered online .when I came into the east oakland store I approach salesperson asking  if they had my parts. from checking he said yes. Then he ask for me too wait at the cashier register.i had grab a bottle of coolant while waiting I was ask  did I want to  purchase my coolant first I said no.i like to wait which was 20mins .they didn't have my parts which the parts was given to some dealer asap.so that explains why there app got railroad when ordering lol.said it said oops ! Got pull in for service lol.all that time for nothing oakland stores need to improve their inventory keeping track with they have.so the customer want be misleading. People what they don't have.</text>

This place used to be General Auto Parts and now is Napa Auto Parts. So far same people working there so the great service still there. For parts it seems they are a bit more but a reasonable price still.</Review>

<review>I tried to pick up an item I ordered online and was told I needed a printed receipt the first time I tried to pick it up at the store. The next day when I brought a printed receipt, I asked a different employee if I could pick up my item and was NOT asked for a printed receipt. Wasted an hour of my time, work on your training, get your practices straight. Otherwise friendly staff, thanks for the service.<//review><username>AshCryptic</username>< Rate>

< Review>
I ordered a part from General / Napa at 12:30PM. The part was promised  in 2 hours. I never got a call from them so I called around 3PM and asked if the part was in. The lady told me it takes 3 hours to get the part. Well, I never got a call or my part by the end of the day. Don't order your part from them if you're in a time crunch because they can't be trusted to get it to you on time.</Review>

Ive had the best luck at this store.  They have great selection of oem new parts.  What they dont have they can usual order same day if you call early.  Good prices and service.<//Review>

It can be a long wait for them to get a part off the shelf and up to the front purchase window, so don't go in here if your in any need for speed.... And after 15 or 20 minutes, it is really annoying to see 8 or 10 sales employees waiting on nobody.... But somehow I am still waiting on anybody to to go get my part off the shelf. I am one of two customer in the entire store.... I left, I don't know what the other fella did.<//review>

Although all the guys there are great.... Bonnie as well, we usually get Chris. He has taken care of my three boys for several years now and Is great with of them. Recently my husband went and Bonnie was super. Highly recommend this place. Don’t think you’d be disappointed by anyone there.<//text>

<Review>We ended up not using the original barber because she didn't show up but Angel took care of my son and apologized and was very professional and courteous. This will be my son's place from now on to get his haircut as Angel did a very good job on him.< /Review><date>1622334853739</date>< Response>

I had a great experience. My haircut came out exactly the way I wanted. I just showered Juan a picture of what I wanted, and he nailed it. He double checked what I wanted before starting. My cut was very clean, and was girlfriend approved. I will definitely go back again.<//review>

Great Shop! Tight Fade. Works great for me, going bald with a Friar Tuck. They bring the fade close, but not into the bald spot. Clean top cut. Always going back.🙌<//Text>

So, you’ve decided to let your beard grow out. Or, you want to get that hair under control. What should you do? Fantastic question. See one of the awesome pros at O.T.G.P. My guy is Dave, but ANY of the peeps at the shop can get you looking right! Dave helps me maintain my beard on the weekly! I always walk, no strut, out looking my best. The shop is always clean and fresh. The conversation is awesome with all of the staff. They take the time to get to know me. Honestly, at this point it’s like going over to chill at a buddy’s place. It’s truly the highlight of my week! Remember to book with Dave. He is MY barber. And, my friend.<//text>

I'm normally around in San Diego and I have my usual place there, but I asked a friend wheres a decent place to have a cut was and this was it. Mo did a stellar job figuring out what I wanted in my style and laid it out. I definitely enjoyed the straight razor shave at the end, which is their finishing move there.

More expensive by only two or three dollars than the regular barbers, but you'll leave thinking about how great the cut was. Thanks!</Review>

<review>I found this place by accident while visiting Nicks Deli. The atmosphere is pretty legit, it Almost has a man cave vide but it's totally family friendly. I come here mostly to get my beard trimmed, and if you know me I'm very particular about who cuts my beard. This place has been trimming my beard for almost a year now and they've been consistent each time. If you have sons or you, yourself are looking for a place to get a trim... This is th place. Just make sure to bring cash, as they don't accept plastic.</review>< Time>

I recommend this Barbershop to anybody that needs a cut. They are really professional, they greet you as you walk in and help you in anyway they can in regards to hair cuts and hair products. They are great with cutting kids hair, they are very patient.l</text>

This place is amazing. I have been getting my hair cut from Dave Lopez for about 6 months now, and I have yet to receive a bad haircut. You are always greeted by one of the crew with a friendly hello. 25$ for hair cut, hot shaving cream line up, hot towel, and a mini shoulder massage! Amazing!
Just make sure you set an appointment, and ask for dave.</Text>

I rarely get my hair cut, so I've never really had shop loyalty. With all that hoping around I have never had such quality hair care. Beer, hot towel, everything.

I had no idea what to ask for and Chris helped my out. Gave him my best joke as a thanks, hope it bounces around the shop.<//review>

<date>1510725433648</date><text>Great cuts!  Traditional barber shop look and feel.  Excellent service that can't beer beat.  Haircut takes a little under an hour long and comes with a straight razor, hot towel, and shoulder massage . It's just a bit pricey at $25 a haircut and they don't charge extra for an appointment.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dd2e60cd225e35:0xc62a42d7559f406c< /Gmap_id>< Response>

Best place to get a haircut hands down. You will not be disappointed. Make sure to make a appointment though. Walk ins are welcome, but all the seats are usully booked< /Text>

<text>I have sat down in barber shops all over the world but this place blows them away. Everything from being greeted to the level of detail that the barber's show to each client is unbelievable. Not to mention the chill atmosphere this is by far one of the best barber shops I have been in on the west coast. 6 stars if I could and I would recommend it to anybody and everybody.</text>< Rate>

They don't rush and take good care of their guests, including a straight razor with hot foam around the edges, after shave, hot towel, and the whole experience. This is a revival of a dying art form on men's grooming. Shop is cash only, but on my visit, Dave took care of me and he accepts cards through Square, if you'll cover his processing fee. Appointments are recommended, buy they will handle walk-ins.< /review>< Pics>

My family and I came to jungle juice cafe because I was craving a smoothie. I got a mango smoothie and my husband got a red, white, and blue smoothie and both were so delicious. It was packed with fruit and so smooth and creamy. My kids got bubble gum ice cream and they approve. The owners were super nice and friendly! I’m definitely coming back soon!</Text>

<Review>My wife and I got the Dole whip and Dole whip float.  I had Dole whip in Palm Springs and Palm Desert, but this is the best Dole whip I have ever had!  Creamy, flavorful soft serve with a hint of carbonation that is unique to Jungle Juice Cafe.  This establishment complements the fact that Hemet has a surprisingly great food scene!  Plus, the owners are very friendly!  Highly recommend it!  If you are coming from San Diego, LA, or Orange County, the 90+ minute drive is totally worth it!  It's that good!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80db6f3b70bb1729:0xe34521b06ec570b7</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Healthy, thirst quenching green goodness! Their green organic smoothie (non-dairy) is amazing.  The fresh fruits are frozen but it doesn't diminish the overall taste. You can add ginger & turmeric if you want.  My recommendations are:

-Pineapple juice + Blackberry + Mango + Coconut flakes + kale + spinach + crushed ice

Or

-Pineapple juice + Mango + Pineapple + coconut flakes + kale + spinach + crushed ice

Trust me, those combos are the bomb :)< /Text>

I had an amazing experience and their smoothies are very delicious.  I can honestly say it tops Jamba Juice and juice it up. People if you haven’t tried their smoothies yet, I say give it a shot’ you will not be disappointed.<//Review>

Soooo fresh and always so friendly. Then they make perfect smoothies. Even my husband has a favorite and he isn't a fruit and veggie guy. You should go there a few times a week. It's good for you amd just SO GOOD!!< /Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I"m not sure how these guys have so many good reviews for customer service. I went in a couple of days ago and there was a lady at the cashier's register. She seemed very short, and rude. I was just asking about some of the items and I got the impression that she did not want to  help me. It was a shame because I really wanted to find a new regular place to go. The place also did not look very clean. I don't think I will be back.  UPDATE? Who the HECK is Steve C???? NO guys, Sorry... I'm not Steve. This was a real review... God forbid someone actually dislike your establishment.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  Great fresh products and all the fruits and veggies they use are organic bought from Sprouts. The owners are very passionate about health and are very caring. I got a frozen yogurt with fresh cut fruit and my friend got a "Make your own Green Drink" and he loved it. He was even was able to add Chia seeds.  They are not cheap in terms of price but their product is not cheap. The do not use powders, if they use say ginger or turmeric they grind it fresh. I don't know the exact number but they have been in business for over 35 years. Way better then Jamba Juice any other juice bar I have been to.<//Text>< pictures>

Best real fruit smoothies!A variety of delicious, iced and hot coffee drinks. Convenient location, with such kind owners. My green 'buy10/getOneFree' card comes in handy,a perk to an already great place. Shaved flavored ice, frozen yogurt,  ice cream, all green natural smoothies...year around, for many years I've loved Jungle Juice :)< /review>

Never had been there before last night. My wife and I went in we met the owners, very friendly people.  They have such a variety of different choices it is almost over whelming. They have yogurt, ice cream. coffee's. Hawaiian shaved ice, banana splits, root beer floats, and more. And the portions and price's are great, So if you want to cool off this summer its a good spot to hit.<//Review>

< Review>
Alicia was Fantastic!!!! Until Stephanie made a rather unexpected appearance into my locker after I had coned off my area. She was standing inside my unit looking at all my stuff, so if anything comes up missing I have this as documented proof, I didnt appreciate her boundary-violation...even though shes attractive, it doesn't give her the right to force her beautiful face and body on me.
It seems you can not close the door while you are inside..., you can barricade the entry with boxes or shoji screens but they have a right to not have their door closed.

I asked Stephanie to mind her boundaries and remove her beautiful face and body, out of my unit, since the space is now mine, and I understand she had to explain the rules, but tact didnt seem to be her better quality...but hey.
.Alicia was Fantastic!!</Review>

The staff were extremely helpful navigating and emergency situation where we needed storage immediately and short term.
Great location. Clean.  Careful if you use yelp to find them. As of August 2020 the yelp map takes you to a different facility on the same road</Review>

Very clean storage space. I have always seen Chris at the storage entrance and he is willing to help with any questions and needs. Highly recommend this storage place. I have my own gate code and hence I can just go in and out anytime. Happy customer since July 2019.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Great storage unit, location and staff. Oscar and Chris were great to work with and are super friendly. I was able to move-in same day with Oscar’s help. I had vacated the unit a day before my scheduled move-out day and Chris had noticed on the day I actually moved out and was able to handle that over the phone. This just demonstrates how observant they are and how safe your items would be at this location. I would definitely recommend this specific location to all of my friends.<//Review>< pictures>

However, I had only been a tenant for about 6 months when I got a notice in the mail saying that the rent (net of insurance) was being increased 22%.  I understand the concept of periodic price adjustments, but I would like someone to explain to me on what basis they can justify an increase of that magnitude.  It feels like a bait-and-switch.  While the actual amount of money isn't large in the grand scheme of things, it's the principle that matters to me.  I can say that in every business I've been involved with, if you tell a customer that their pricing is going up 22%, they wave goodbye and take their business elsewhere, which I am inclined to do once the covid-19 shutdown is over.  Buyer beware of Public Storage pricing.< /Text>< Pics>

I left my storage unit unlocked for about two hours and he had already put a safety lock on the door to protect it. It is strange when the property manager makes you want to keep your storage unit because his service is so great. I highly recommend this location and this company above any and all location and companies<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fa20785df015b:0x172ba3e51974db2a</gmap_id></record>

I did a short term rental at Public Storage in San Carlos. Oscar was helpful in finding a space for me. He did mention there might be dust from local construction which did settle on some of my stored items. There are tarps to cover your things as well as other storage and moving supplies available for purchase in their office.  Chris gave me a quick helpful reminder call prior to the next month's rent being due. I would use them again if I need to store things another time.< /text>

Nicely tucked away behind In n Out on the other side of the freeway. Clean facility with good security. I was helped by Chris who was very thorough. I called and left a message and he called me back very quickly. I went down and looked at a unit that I decided was a little to small so I asked to see the next size up. Chris informed me that I could get the next size up for that AND pay LESS. So he saved me money. He informed me honestly of all the pros and cons, and with 17 years at that location, I trust his knowledge. Over all a great experience in customer service. I highly recommend this storage facility because should there be an issue in the future I already know they have excellent and honest customer service.<//Text>

I needed a storage space for a couple of weeks while some work was being done on my apartment.  I called up Public Storage because it was close to home.  The man that answered was very nice and quickly reserved a unit for me.  Shortly afterwards I received a call from the manager (Chris) of the Public Storage property verifying my unit reservation.  When I went in to pay for the unit, I worked with Chris and he was very nice and explained everything clearly.  Chris may my visit there enjoyable and easy.  If I need a storage unit again I will definitely go to Public Storage.<//review>

<Review>Ashley was fantastic! She knew her job, she was resourceful, polite, professional and thorough. Public Storage is lucky to have an employee like Ashley and I was lucky to have her help Friday night. She even offered to stay late if we needed a little extra time to resolve the situation! Wow, Ashley will be successful in whatever she chooses to do in life!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808fa20785df015b:0x172ba3e51974db2a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great service from Chris!  Very patient whilst explaining the different units sizes/options/location on the premises, etc.  Would give 5-stars; however - the $1/1st month special ended up being more like $76 (still better than paying the full price) and a nominal "cleaning fee" was later charged...um...I had three boxes and an indoor bike trainer in the unit for less than 4-weeks.  I know it's a standard fee they charge everyone, but the unit didn't require "cleaning".< /Review>

The crew here is very nice and helpful.  But it's a public storage.  How much can I say?  The units are at ground level, and not much above Bay level.  Dirt build up in the units is an issue, and it's so close to sea level I would actually worry about flooding.  The unit I was looking into had evidence on the floor of water Ingres.  But the manager is super friendly and helpful, which is a plus.</text>

I have occasion to rent storage space frequently on a short term basis.  I have rented units at many different facilities and have found that this particular location has consistently provided a high level of excellence.  The property is clean, well lit and secure, thanks to property manager Chris - who is a real pro.  I will rent from them again and recommend this property highly!< /text>

The facility is clean although the units do get dusty on the inside - good idea to bring a tarp to cover your belongings, and bring a padlock before renting as the ones they sell at the office are overpriced.

Overall my experience has been good.  The best thing about the facility is the manager, Chris - he is personable, helpful and really cares about his customers.< /Review>

<Review>I have had storage, with different storage units here for many years. During that time, I have always been completely satisfied and have never had any problems.  The facilities are conveniently located and in excellent condition, well maintained, very orderly. The customer service has been 5 star, always responsive, accommodating, respectful, and friendly--I could not ask for better service or find it anywhere.  Manager Chris and his team are the best--attentive of customers and their needs,< /Review>< Pictures>

I've been a Public Storage customer for a number of years at various locations both in California and other states. I must say that Chris is a top Manager and exercises care and professionalism on his property at all times. Extremely CLEAN premises and always well lit and secure. I feel extremely comfortable knowing my personal goods are stored safely at Chris' facility. He's a hard working guy and deserves top awards for his outstanding performance. I wish all Public Storage locations were as good as his. THANK YOU.<//text>

I had an issue with a public storage unit in Boston and went to this location to see if they could help. Chris was fantastic! He took the time to call the manager in Boston and helped me resolve the problem.  He came up with a solution that no one else had suggested.  Thank you! If I ever need storage in this area, this is the place I would go to.<//text>

I set up my account online with a great rate and when I got the the facility, Chris and Leslee had my paper work ready to go. Chris showed me the unit, which was perfect for my needs. In less than 15 minutes I was signing the documents and getting my key. The facility is very clean, secure and well run. It's hard to imagine a better storage experience!</Review>

<Review>The manager Chris has always been great to work with and when I changed unit for a larger one at the Public Storage down the road, he contacted his colleague to help me prepare the change. Chris made my "stay" at this location as pleasant as possible and I encourage people in need of a Storage to go to this location, they will have excellent Service too.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Was treated kindly and informed of all necessary things to do. I had never used a storage unit and Leslee was kind enough to explain all the details I would need to know. Friendly and helpful. I ordered online and it was quite quick and easy to fill out the paperwork. I got a call a week later to make sure I had settled in my things. It made me feel like the business was looking out for me. A+ Will use same location again if needed. :)</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Have been renting for many years now. Had a storage unit at another location previous to this one. I like this storage facility much better. I like the location and the ability to get in at just about any time. Chris, the manager is always friendly and keep the place very clean.<//text>

Leslee helped me find right size unit, and then was very efficient and clear about paper work. It gave me confidence in the choose of storage company. Latter she was equally kind in closing out the unit. A good experience from start to finish.< /Review>

Overall, great service and support.  The manager even called me to let me know that someone he didn't recognize was moving stuff in my storage unit.  It turns out it was my son.  They keep an eye on the facility.</Review>

<text>We had an unexpected loss in our family and we needed to move a full household of items to a storage unit fairly quickly. I called three places and right from the start this Public Storage in San Carlos was the most friendly.

After meeting with Chris in person it was easy to make a final decision and know that my family would deal with someone who would be helpful and cooperative. Over the 5 months that we needed the storage unit, Chris was consistently polite on the phone, and with my older parents in person when we came to move everything out.

I'd recommend anyone who doesn't already have a favorite storage location to at least call or go by and meet Chris before making a final decision. If their prices are in the ballpark with others your comparing it with, then you'll be glad you chose this one for the positive other things that go along with dealing w/a storage unit, etc.

Thanks again Chris! My family appreciated your attitude and kind approach during such a difficult time for us.< /text>< Rate>

<text>Dear folks,
Chris, the Manager, has made a most sorrowful experience a little bit happier. My Mom and Dad died at the end of 2006 and beginning of 2007. My siblings stuffed all my personal  belongings into a 10' X 20' storage locker. I couldn't even go into it for years. It made me cry. But, the one good thing about the place was Chris.
He is kind and would make me laugh.
That is a wonderful quality, for one who hates to relive the death of their parents.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

What these people are doing should be illegal. They start you off low and then jack up the price until you cant afford it and then when you slip on a payment they hold your stuff and if you cant pay they show no mercy and get rid of your stuff. Heartless thieves. Never again....</Text>

I found Tony's Tires to be fast and efficient. They were very polite and got the job done in no time at all. The price was right also I had seen and went to other places and they were much higher than there. Thank you Tony for a great job.< /Text>

EDIT: The next day we found a hole. In the side of the tire. We could see and hear the hole without any help or test. Very disappointing. We called and they offered to take care of it (thus the second star) but we just chalked up the $35 as a loss and got new tires. Might be better to find somewhere else. ORIGINAL-->Quick, friendly, helpful, and a good price! Definitely will come back!</review>

<Review>I've only been there for tires but I'd go there for other things they carry if needed.  I've replaced a tire on the same wheel three times because of road hazards that were not visible in the particular conditions.  As the tire being replaced was not new I was able to obtain a good quality replacement that was mounted, balanced, and installed within my budget.< /Review><date>1580587246004<//date></record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Shopped around with Chevy dealers, other tire stores and Costco for tires  for my Chevy pick up. I am new to the area and many coworkers at EAB recommended Tony’s, He gave me his best price upfront, a single price out the door, no coupons or rebates and he was $100 less then anyone for a set of 4 tires. No haggling or messing around, had the tires I wanted delivered the next day and got me in and out in under 60 minutes on a busy Saturday AM. $600 for a set of 4 Goodyear Eagles truck tires.

The gentlemen who work here are so helpful and get the work done super fast. I needed two tires replaced and this establishment was recommended to me by my mechanic. I made my way over there looking to get some better used tires to make it to some very important appointments. They changed out my two front tires with used tires that were basically brand new!!!! They ALSO let me know what they saw that needed to be fixed under the car while they changed the tires! Super helpful, and the price is right!! As a person who doesn't have loads of money, I was able to purchase and have them replace my tires for a great price! This place, I highly recommend. They don't disappoint!<//review>

<review>I love Tony's Tires. If you need a tire at a reasonable price then go-to Tony. If you are not rich but you need a tire to get you going Tony also sells used tires. He charges between $20 to $35 depending on the tire. I have personally gone to Tony first for every tire need I've had. That said the tires on my van right now came from Tony used and they made me all the way up to Washington safely. Definitely give Tony a call if you need a tire.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Many places in AV will try to charge $2 ea tire for air. Went to get air in my tires and was not charged. A friendly staff ready to help. This was not my first time. First visit was the same friendly service. I was referred by one of my family members. They are legit! Updated. 10/14/19 Still the best place to go for great customer  service and tires.< /review>

Had a sudden puncture and needed to get it repaired before the week started. These folks were open relatively late on a Saturday, so they saved the day! Super friendly, very affordable, and I was in and out in less than 20 minutes! Other places would have wasted my entire afternoon and left me with a sour experience, but their service really made my night!<//text>

Good place to have your tires changed. The person who took care of our tires was fast, efficient and we ended up spending less than what were dreading. Thank you!<//text>

The gentleman check my tire pressure and said no charge I was shock give me a little air in one of the tires, and went to help the next costumer with a smile.  I was so happy  that I  sent my daughter to find him and give him a tip for taking the time to assist us.  I feel that I have no problem giving my business to a place like this.

<review>Went to get 4 tires mounted and balanced. Talk to the girl there. Said they get me in a minute. 4 people pulled up in the meantime. They got serviced while I stood there for 20 mins. So I left went to the Tire Store!! Got help right away. Have 2 more sets to mount and balance. Tonys didn't need my money I guess.<//review><Name>Mike Turowski<//Name>< UserId.>

They went way above and beyond what you
would ever expect. Fixed two tires and found
4 lug nuts my car needed...No Charge
So I went and got 3 pizzas for Toni and the
guys...Thanks again Toni for the great service.</Text>

<GmapID>0x80c25aca65b242c5:0x880a85cbd52ac953< /GmapID><text>Extremely rude and unhelpful! I called to enquire on the availability of a used tire fur my truck spare, and a lady answered the phone. She said she had a lot of used tires of the size I requested. I then asked her what the year of manufacture was on them and she immediately started to give me an attitude. She was very rude. She said, and I quote: "well if the age is going to be an issue then we dont have anything for you". Knowing that tires over 7 years old are no longer safe to use, it seems my simple question was justified, and to be expected. My advice to this dealer? Pick your employees more carefully!< /text>< user_id>

Guys are great, quick n with a smile. Females usually get the bad deals but this is an honest buisness. Loved it. Won't go anywhere else. I went with my 3 small kids. One of the employees bought my kids chips, too nice. Awwwww.  Thanks for the great service.< /Review>

<Review>They no longer give free rotations when you buy tires from them. They don't honor their warranty and when I tried to rotate the tires myself the lug nuts they were so tight they bent the tire iron.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><GmapID>0x80c25aca65b242c5:0x880a85cbd52ac953< /GmapID>< response>

<review>Horrible! They didnt even balance my tires right! They put my psi at 41 when on the door it clearly says 30psi! They didnt even put the small wieghts on the rims! I would give them 0 stars is i could! When George was working here they did quality work... now they are going downhill fast! Take your car to unique wheels and tires quality work! Never taking my car here its garbage!< /review>< Pics>

<review>Tonys tires is by far the best tire shop in the AV, LA county, California, maybe even the WORLD. I have several luxury cars and I ONLY trust Tony's tires to do the work. I've been to other tire shops and they either gouge me on the price, are very slow and inconsiderate of time, don't carry my tire, or all the above. I even went to Primos tires once and FIRST when I pulled up it smelled like the guy was smoking a PRIMO, he had just told some lady in a wheelchair $50 JUST TO CHANGE OUT HER TIRE and then proceeded to tell me they don't have my size, wait until tomorrow, and that they don't know how to put my spare on.... I think while the lady in the wheelchair wasn't looking the guy was making rude, vulgar, sexual gestures towards her, it was very uncomfortable. So if you don't want a place that's going to overcharge you, that gives you good fast service, have your tires in stock, be friendly, drug free, and won't take advantage of your handicapped grandmother, go to Tony's Tires PERIOD<//review>< Pictures>
