We are all human and make mistakes. I just wish this Pizza Hut location would own their mistake verse making excuses. I placed an order by phone two days ago to have pizzas delivered to my daughter's school by 11am today. I get a call from the school around 11:30am letting me know pizza had not arrived. I called the location and was told the delivery was scheduled for 11pm. 🙄 Not sure how that's possible when sign on store says they close at 11pm on Wednesdays. Also don't know of any schools for children open that late at night. Now I'm scrambling to pickup pizzas from this store in-person to drop off before first round of kids leave at 12 noon. I get to the location to pick pizzas up. I have to wait for them to finish cooking, and I was told the online order listed delivery time at 11pm. I had to remind the employee that the order was placed by phone; not online. I couldn't deal with issue at time of pickup because I had hungry kids with empty plates waiting for pizza. When we called later, the Regional Manager, who would not give his name, happened to be onsite. Instead of owning the mistake, he said teachers could have a late night meeting onsite at 11pm. Not sure what teachers are hanging out at a preschool that time of night. Truly disappointed in the service received today.< /Review>

< Review>
I order pizza once a week online, and I like to keep trying new places, last time I get Pizza Hut, there are way better options in TO.

Driver shows up, I answer the door and he asks me for money, yet we paid online, not huge but that was a first, then he drops both sauces, and pulls a pizza out of the box with a broken seal, also a first, and I wouldn’t have typically been upset but how the heck do you break the seal on that, I should have denied the pizza, next time I will.

Here’s my biggest issue, and please ask yourself this, Would YOU eat food that was delivered to your home with a broken seal?  Would you buy the gallon of milk that’s already been opened at the grocery store?  I think not...

If you need a 10 pizza, your definitely not gonna get what you paid for, I wouldn’t have paid 5, and with all the fees and surcharges I could have gotten Blaze Pizza or Fresh Brothers and actually enjoyed my meal for a few more bucks.

I’m free for feedback if anyone at PizzaHut wants to provide a better experience for their customers.

Wow, the price for this meal was way too expensive compared to what we got. The extra cost to do business in California, plus delivery fee.  I could get more food and better quality from a pretty good restaurant for what we paid.  Your price is too high for the quality of food.</text>

<text>I ordered 2 Detroit Pizza (supreme & cheese) and the only thing I got was crust and sauce!!!!! Just a little amount of cheese on both and a little trace of sausage and onion on the supreme. I was so disappointed  and throw them away. I will never let any of my friends to do the same mistake<//text><Gmap_id>0x80e825354211a6d3:0xc5fdee1b2a5d7e5e</Gmap_id><rating>1<//rating>< userid>

We ordered the Detroit style all meat option. It was hard to tell there was any meat on it. Mostly sauce. We ended up adding meat out of our fridge. Our first pizza from Pizza Hut was very disappointing.</review>

Too many charges on top of the price of the pizza that was was skimpy on the cheese and the toppings! The cheese should cover the whole pizza and more than 5 pepperoni slices on large pizza would be nice.<//Review>

Thin crust pizza was a disappointment.  I will never order it again.  The outer part of the pizza was much thinner and therefore burnt.  I would never order this pizza.< /text>

The curb side pick up was non existent this day. The number sends you to corporate and they transferred my call to the store and I held for about 7 minutes before I hung up and went in to get my food.< /Review>

Sorry to say, the quality has gone down tremendously.  I could literally count the onions, mushrooms and bell peppers on my pizza.  Why even bother with ingredients.  The pizza did not taste good at all.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I saw a deal for a large pizza with 8 wings for 15 bucks the other day and decided to give it a go.  Haven't had Pizza Hut in years.  I went to check out and they added almost 7 dollars in fees to the order.  Seriously.  $5.25 for delivery and $1.50 in service fees.  The wings were actually pretty good for frozen garbage out of the bag.  But the pizza was awful.  Never again Pizza Hut.  To charge people almost 50% in fees is outrageous and you have lost my business forever.</Text>< pictures>

Must be an act of god that they managed to get 3.5 stars. Pizza Hut Pizza is good. But this business and service is Grade A bad. Wouldn't even come up to the front when I wanted to order something, mean while you could hear someone scaping around in the back. Terrible customer service, devoid of management< /Review>

I tried ordering the 16 piece Chicken Wings, and I can't tell you if they were good or not, because they never arrived.  I called again to find out where they were and they told me they tried to call me twice about the order ... which they did not.  Good food if you can get it.<//Review>

< Review>
I used to love Pizza Hut... and I'd give this a 3 stars for its meh-ness as a company now and the food has seemed to get less good over the years... but had to give it 2 stars because they are charging for parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Screw that bull. They are the only chain that does it too. I'm sticking with Dominoes and Papa John's and even cardboard pizza Little Cesar's from now on.<//Review>

I've been multiple times and I must say, the food is good, quality is good, it's well made. Customer service is awful!! If you order for pickup, expect to wait a while because people ignore you even if you are at the front, and they don't come to the front at all. They stay in the back. They even have a bell that rings every time you open the door. No one comes to the front. In my opinion, this is unacceptable. I understand the food won't get any colder but still. Having to wait a while is unacceptable<//text>

{'time': 1539405341105, 'text': "Hi Walt, the delivery fee goes towards paying for gas and the insurance necessary to deliver among other things. We also have many deals on our website such as a large three topping pizza for only $9.99 plus tax and SF which is necessary due to the rising costs of doing business in CA. Instead of adding it into the price it's just a small percentage added on in the end. Would you like to email us at phcares@awrg.org so we can discuss this further? Please include the store, date, and time of your order. We'd be happy to answer any other questions you may have."}< /Response>
<Review>$4+ delivery fee to deliver 1 mile away.
+ a service fee so that pizza hut allegedly can afford to do business in the state of California?

Others in the area might allow you to rob them.  I know what it costs to make a pie, and I really hope Pizza Hut is forced out of California entirely some day.

You pay your drivers dismally, with lackluster benefits, charge all these fees which doesn't go to the driver or associates.  And then we're supposed to tip 20% on the total before any coupons are applied.

How does no one else see that $30 for 8 slices of pizza is not okay?<//Review>< username>

<Review>I've been a runner for years and also do different types of exercise here and there...but I've NEVER (in my 30 years) found an activity that I'm so addicted to as much as Bouldering!  I think about it when I'm awake, and it seriously helps me get through my work day.  I've been to LA Boulders multiple times now and I love every single moment of it!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I like how authentic the yoga is. There is a respect for the practice that comes across as really genuine. Plus, Samantha (who led the intro classes I've taken) makes you feel very comfortable no matter what your level is, and she creates a relaxed, positive energy in class.< /Review></record>

Wow I just called the owner to ask about the $7 Groupon drop inain classsclass she said they weren't doing any sort of classes I asked why there was a Groupon up. the woman got extremely defensive rude and condescending and informed me I shouldn't be giving her unsolicited advice.. Wow yoga is about inner peace kindness and patience. this is something this owner is lacking. This hippocrit needs to go back to India and learn  more from these gurus! Will be staying away from this place..< /Text>

< Review>
Since joining Yoga Shakti, my yoga practice has turned totally inward! I used to compete with myself and others in class. Now I feel as though the true meaning of yoga has been explained!! I focused on my breath, go reach mindfulness. These instructors know what they’re doing!!<//Review>

Have been going to Yoga Shakti for nine years -- notwithstanding a half hour drive. I started with a prenatal class -- which I loved! -- while pregnant with my first child, had a postnatal break for about two years, tried a level 2 class, and have been passionately attached to it (all through my second pregnancy as well) ever since. Great place for practicing yoga!<//text>

I have enjoyed taking Level 2 classes with Camille. She is very knowledgeable and accommodating. She frequently asks the class what we would like to focus on and she builds her sequences to maximize your practice.<//Text>

Good instructors for the levels of yoga you may wish to take (e.g. levels 1, 1-2, 2)...the new facilities are a big improvement over the previous location...rooms are bigger, with better ventilation and lighting.<//review>

< Review>
I encountered an instructor whose attitude was disgusting. I witnessed her verbally attacking another person and went as far as cursing at the unfortunate party who was talking to her in a polite manner. All I know is that the angry person works here (she kept repeating it) and I feel this needs to be stated as I found it highly ironic coming from a woman who is supposed to promote a positive mindset. I am definitely going to be boycotting this place as I feel this was unprofessional to the highest degree.<//Review>

< Review>
Yoga Shakti is a great place with enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and helpful teachers and staff. They help you to progress at your own pace and prepare you well for level advancement. It is helpful to find your own inner peace, find something to help keep you physically fit and find a meaning within practicing yoga. The teacher training program which I am involved in, is a true blessing, helping students to be independent and make the most of teaching. It is worth the price.

The main teachers I have been going to are Ashlee Goite. She has a lot of upper level moves, but they connect and flow well. There are gentle soft transitions. The practice is not too hard on your body as long as you take necessary modifications. The other teachers I go to are Lauren Dahl's class. She does a lot of good prep work for inversions. Another teacher I go to is Colleen Hieber's class. She has a lot of good standing move sequences, high energy, and pushes you to do your best. All the teachers are really good and friendly. I would recommend them. I believe you should do the level you feel most comfortable with and then build up gradually.< /Review>

<Text>I really loved every moment I spent here.

I bought a Groupon for 10 classes and used it up in less than a month.

My favorite class was Colleen Hieber's Level 1-2 on Tuesday and Thursday night.  She is great.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Love, love LOVE this studio!  Wonderful instructors and good mix of class offerings to suit your mood/schedule.  Parking can be a bit of challenge during peak hours (between 5:00-6:30pm weekdays and after 9:00am Saturdays due to the Farmers Market), so come 10-15 minutes early whenever possible.  One restroom, one changing room, two asana rooms (classrooms), and a meditation room.  Albeit small, the space is very efficiently utilized!  Favorite classes include early morning (6:00am!) Vinyasa with Viviana and Friday evening restorative yoga with Ivy.  Great way to wind down your week and relax.  Warning: The entire UTC is teeming with little critters (I’m referring to cockroaches).  Don’t be alarmed when you see one practicing shavasana or happy baby.< /Review>

<review>i recently started practicing yoga @ shakti and what i appreciate about the studio:

1)  intimacy:  i've been going to level 2 classes and each class is really no more than 8-10 people.  you get a lot of personal attention and hands on adjustments from the instructors.  if you have questions you can ask during the session as well.
2)  challenge:  each class session is 1.5 hours, but tough 1.5 hours.  i think because it's not heated they can push you further with more challenging poses as opposed to what i'm typically used to at a heated studio.
3)  great instructors:  i've only taken classes with ashlee but she mixes up the flow a lot and we even got to do sun salutations with blankets and boy was that a core workout!
4)  not corporaty:  i'm used to other studios being very "corporate".  shakti is definitely much more spiritual.
5)  amazing merchandise:  love all the jewelry the studio carries, but expensive!

there are 2 rooms in the studio, and i believe they're right next to each other...  so sometimes we can hear instructions coming from the other room and it's a bit distracting.  other than that, i want to try out different instructors.  i first heard about shakti through rebecca fink who i've taken a class with before and i knew i had to try shakti out! :)  i need to master handstands!

p.s. they have kids yoga :)</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcde0c3e15d105:0x390d1e42df559a61< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Went here basically every week all throughout high school. Always has great food, service, and drinks. Fills you up really well, & a great place for students to hang and do homework.</Text>

Kids love this place! Their shave ice is one of the best you can get around sgv. Our go to food here is their friend rice and braised beef noodle soup which is also delicious! Highly recommend this place.< /review>

Dropped in for shaved snow. It was wonderful. The green tea was good, but the mango was amazing. Actual food also looked good, but I didn't have any.< /text>

<review>Popcorn chicken is delicious and so flavorful! I usually just come here to grab some shaved snow, but I actually bought food the other day and was pleasantly surprised. My kids loved the minced pork over rice and we also ordered the fried chicken leg with rice and that was great as well. The food comes out fast and the girl working the cash register is really nice every time I see her.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Awesome hole in the wall Boba shop with good prices, nice drinks and a lot of space to find a place to sit and relax. They also have outlets and wifi so you can bring your laptop. Playing cards are also available to borrow from the cashier, although the quality is bad so I recommend you bring your own.< /review>

I always order my iced drinks half sweetener. I did so at this place. And actually very unsweetened now, which i like. Meaning, they probably don't over sweeten their drinks here.</text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) It tastes approximately 90% like Taiwan’s salty and crispy chicken stalls
Fried stuff is about $4-5
Sweet or not spicy, it would be better if it can be fried a bit longer
If you miss the taste of Taiwan, you can try it, recommended!
*Cash only, remember to bring

(Original)
和台灣的鹹酥雞攤味道近似90%
炸物大概$4-5不等
甜不辣如果可以再炸久一點會更好
想念台灣的味道可以來試試，推薦!
*只收現金記得帶<//review>

I brought some recent college grads here to buy their first suits and each one walked out with a 3-piece suit, shirt, tie, belt, and socks for $250 apiece. Eddie helped them find the right fit and they looked sharp thanks to his expert help. Highly recommend.<//Text>< gmapID>

Incredible service! Eddie helped me find two suits that I really liked. He worked within my urgent time frame, graduation, but of course I made some compromises to get a close to perfect suit in time. He also gave me his word that my suit will be made perfect on a second visit. For people who have more time and planning, you'll really be able to experience the maximum service this place has to offer.

The facility is large, so don't worry about being in a crampy spacy. The changing rooms don't have mirrors but there are large mirrors right outside. This place also does very accurate tailoring so if you need to you can also bring your clothes.

Overall I would come again and would bring family here if I needed to find another suit. They're great and I highly recommend it ☺️.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I have been shopping at the Suit Co since 2012, I recently reached out to them for my suit for my wedding and engagement photos....I called them and Anas took very good care of me. He was able to take my notes and listen to my details and was so kind in doing so.
We exchange a few photos as I chose my suit and shoes...the shipment took longer than expected but that was not Anas’s fault. We stayed in touch via text and I must say it was a great shopping experience,

Thank you Anas!!!

I’ll be back!</Review>< Pictures>

The best place to get a suit! I came in on a Thursday for a Sunday wedding and Anas hooked me up with everything for just under $200! Only took 30 minutes to pick the right suit and get fitted. I really appreciated the assistance Anas provided during the whole experience.</text>

Yes I had to drive an hour and a half,
but after experiencing horrible service at a local shop in Temecula I decided to see what options I had.
After many searches and phone calls, I decided to try out The Suit Company.
Anas exceeded my expectations from start to finish.  From finding me the perfect suit for my occasion,  to hooking me up with all of the little extras I  needed to complete my outfits.
Anas went above and beyond.  I went in for one suit and left with three.  The price for one suit were at a great price already,  but I even received a better deal on three.
I was extremely happy with the customer service that I chose to have all of my tailoring done by their in-house  tailor.
It was done fast and tailored professionally. With that said,  I can promise, you won't be disappointed!
Customer service is on point, selection is great, and prices are amazing.
It doesn't get any better.
Thanks again for all of your help  Anas!

Don't listen to what these soft skinned negative reviewers say... they have tons of awesome denim, plus tees, Pendletons, etc. Only problem I have is that I don't live close by anymore.</text>

< review>
I did a little research looking for a tailor to get some pants hemmed. The Suit Co. came up with glowing reviews, and I decided to check them out as I needed a few pairs done asap. I sent an appointment request via Yelp and was told to just walk in. There was a wedding party in the store when we arrived. We were not greeted when we entered the store (no problem, being busy with customers is usually a good thing!) Finally had someone acknowledge us (about ten minutes later), then waited around some more before they were ready to assist.

We were there just to get some pants hemmed. Nothing fancy. We went into the fitting room to try on the pants, then came out expecting to get fitted. I was then told that they don't have time for us. We walked out and decided to take our business elsewhere.

After communicating with Abel (via Yelp), I was told that they don't take appointments and only work as a first come first serve basis. I'm baffled as to why a company that sells suits (and obviously caters to wedding parties) does not take appointments. I'm equally baffled at the lack of employees working the floor on a Sunday afternoon. It just does not seem efficient.<//review>

{'time': 1565896388474, 'text': "Dear K D, we highly appreciate your feedback and terribly sorry for the experience you had. Our establishment has grown throughout the years and thriven with our customers feedback. We have been serving Orange County for the past 15 years at our Santa Ana and Costa Mesa locations. Although we do not take appointments we make sure that everyone is helped accordingly and our reviews, success, and returning customers is what we have to show for this.\n\nAfter discussing this situation with our staff, we understand the scenario more clearly. You're right, it was Sunday afternoon and as you understood we were attending a few customers ahead of you. We had you folks try on the pants because we were ready to take measurements. The only issue here was your urgency to get this done same day. As much as we would have liked to hem your pants for you the same day we had a handful of orders ahead of you which is why our tailor said we could not fulfill your request. We would be happy to assist you any other time as we have our thousands of happy customers. Feel free to reach out to us directly for any further assistance. Thank you and happy shopping!"}</resp>

<username>Jonathan Stone<//username><text>The staff was very helpful. The store is clean and well lit. They have an excellent selection of tuxedos. I was disappointed with their lack of label choices. According to the sales person assisting me they carry only two brands. Most of the suits I saw were polyester blend. When I inquired about wool suits the selection narrowed rapidly. This is a great place to buy a suit for your kid, but not necessarily to build out a business wardrobe.<//text><user_id>117853059412031194906< /user_id></record>

I came in here looking for a casual dress jacket and was so impressed with their collection of suits that I ended getting one. Stephanie was very polite and helpful. Not having known my measurements she quickly helped me identify a suit and shirt that would fit me well. They also provide tailoring services. I had my suit ready in a few days. Happy customer.< /Text>

<Text>The Suit Co has a nice selection of suits at very reasonable and affordable pricing. For our wedding party, it actually ended up being cheaper for us to buy tailored suits here than to rent them from Men's Wearhouse! And now our guys get to walk away with a nice suit they can wear again and again.
Stephanie and Jasmine were really helpful and knowledgeable with helping my fiance pick out a style that looked good on his frame.</Text></record>

<review>This place blew my mind. Had just left 2 department stores where no one even greeted us & the price & selection didn’t compare. Walked into this place & got fantastic one-on-one service by Aristy; there was a great selection of suits & sizes; & the prices can’t be touched. I walked out of here with a custom-tailored suit, a dress shirt, tie, belt, shoes, & socks for $230. If you’re in the market for a suit, this is hands down the place to go.<//review><username>Brian Bell</username>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We popped in to initially rent a suit for a formal wedding that upcoming weekend because surely we couldn’t turn around the alterations for a new suit for the cost of renting...boy were we wrong! Jessica was great! We told her a color family we were interested in. She came back with a beautiful deep royal blue classic suit in his size. It was perfect! We asked when we should be back to pick up the pants and Jessica told us to go pick out a shirt and tie and she could have it altered while we did that. I was blown away by how incredibly easy she made our first experience with The Suit Co. This Momma is happy...FIVE STARS!< /Review>< Pics>

I had an incredible experience with The Suit Co! From the moment I stepped in the door, I felt welcomed and cared for. They immediately sought me out and asked what they could do for me! Instantly, I knew I was in good hands! They helped me select from an array of inverntory a well-fitting suit, and allowed me to cycle through multiple options until I was comfortable with what I had! They were extremely quick with measuring for the alterations I needed, and I was in and out in less than 45 minutes with a suit ready only 3 days later! Definitely will
be returning! Can’t wait to come back in and get fitted!</Text>

<text>This was my first time at suitco and my first time getting a suit. The suit was for a wedding. The experience was great. I was helped immediately as I walked in. I was helped by Jessica and she was friendly, patient, and extremely helpful. I was able to pick a suit that fit me well and met my preferences. The store has a good selection to choose from. They were also helpful with tailoring options. The turnaround with tailoring was about a 2 day turnaround. Would recommend.< /text>< user_name>

Getting the suit tailored is going to take 6 days but looking forward to seeing how it comes out. Definitely would reccommend this place to those that need a quick suit!<//Text>

<Review>I went to get fitted for a wedding. There was only one young man working the entire outlet. I was very impressed by the fast service. He was very helpful. Definitely knew what he was doing. I really enjoyed my time there and had fun getting fitted. Overall great experience. More importantly, the suit was excellent. What makes this place 5 stars, in my oppinion, was the generous discount the young man provided. Making it super affordable. In the future I will be going back to buy all my suits here because of the quality of the suits and their reasonable price.</Review>< userid>

<user_name>Infiniti And Beyond<//user_name><Review>I can't give this place anything less than 5-stars because it really did exceed my expectations. As you read in previous reviews, this place is good service and most importantly, a great bargain!

I have purchased suits in from Men's Warehouse many years ago but those are long expired.  I needed something new and decided to give this place try. Honestly, it really was quick and painless. I walked out with a full suit, white inner shirt and ties in less than 30 minutes. It was a phenomenal deal! I wasn't looking to drop $$$$$ and I'm sure most of you aren't either, so just come on in.

I remembered to mention yelp promotions and got all kinds of gifts and discounts. So don't forget! And I cannot forget to give much praise for the young gentleman Abel that provided the utmost professional service. Don't be fooled by the young looks, he knew a alot about suits...much more than me anyways...thanks again "The Suit Co."   I will be back!<//Review>< Response>

<Response>None< /Response><text>This place was great, and they really took care of myself and all my groomsmen.

My only frustration was the fact that they could not take payment over the phone, and will not start a suit until a deposit is made. This made it difficult to accommodate my out-of-area groomsmen. I had to drive down there myself and make a payment and then my groomsmen had to reimburse me which was not ideal with so many other things going on.

Overall I still give them 5 stars because their customer service was excellent, suits were nice quality, they ended up getting all of my suits to me on time despite issues on my end, and they even threw in a few extras to make up for the inconvenience.<//text>< user_name>

Stephanie was very friendly when she was helping us find the proper suit and help us get it fitted. The store also gave free accessories to go with the suit. Got free shirt, tie, and pocket square. Definitely a one stop shop< /Text>

I went in without an appointment and was helped straight away. I needed a couple of starter suits for work, so I wasn’t very knowledgeable with the process. The staff was very professional and knew exactly what to pick out.

The prices are very reasonable as well so don’t worry—you’ll get good quality without breaking the bank. Will return for sure!< /Text>

< review>
We called to make an appointment so we wouldn’t have to wait around. We were told to just come in, no appointment necessary. We went and waited to be helped, then left because the staffs were too busy.

Yeah, they have a large selection but unless you know exactly what you want and how each suit fits, the large selection isn’t beneficial when you’re searching without a staff member’s help.< /review>
<resp>{'time': 1532562291539, 'text': "Dear Mr./Ms. Nguyen, we're sorry we weren't able to satisfy you during your visit to our store. We do not take appointments at this time as we help all customers who walk-in. The wait time is roughly 10min to 15min at worst and you can always be rest assured that we will do our very best to help you. We have strived to provide the best quality suits to all of Orange County since 2007 and at amazing prices too! We're hoping you give us another chance, you won't be disappointed. Just check-out our other reviews!"}</resp>< name>

<text>The Suit Company, couldn't be more happier with them. Anas provided the most efficient customer service and quick response I could have imagined. In very tight notice I was assisted and guaranteed that my suit would be ready within 2hrs. Thank you The Suit Company...< /text>< Response>

The guy really knows his stuff and was able to put me in the suit I wanted in just a few minutes, and wasn't constantly trying to upsell me like some other places. In fact, the price was much lower than I was expecting. This will be my first stop next time I need a suit.<//text>

After my horrible experience at the Men's Warehouse, I decided to come to The Suit Co! The Men's Warehouse tried to sell me a suit that was way too baggy, and did not fit the body right. I asked them if they would tailor the suit for me if I bought it there, and they said it would take at least two weeks. The Suit Co on the other hand was an amazing experience. My Tailor Anas was amazing! He took a few measurements and looked at me and found me the perfect suit in my price range. He is an experienced tailor, and it shows. He knows how the suit should fit the body, and knows what adjustments must be made. He also tried to save me money, and found me a suit that did not need much alterations. I only had to tailor my suit pants, which came out to $10!!! He was also able to tailor my pants in just 1 day! If you're like me and you feel intimidated by going to these formal wear places, you do not have to be! Anas will take great care of you! This was truly a remarkable experience. I will definitely come here again!< /review>

<Review>I came to the Suit Co. with my wife.  Anas greeted us, took my measurements, asked what style and color I liked, and brought out one suit after another based on our reactions.

My wife is *very* particular about the details but Anas was very helpful and patient. I think I must have tried out at least 10 suits. We finally found one that was perfect, and the pricing was very reasonable.

We did also stop by Men's Warehouse just to compare and not only does the Suit Co. have the same selections, the Suit Co. Is MUCH cheaper. Like 50% cheaper!

I highly recommend the Suit Co., and major props to Anas for being super awesome!<//Review>< Resp>

Great and very professional service. Anas was patient with me and my many questions and helpful, making sure I got what I wanted and would be happy with tailoring. I need a suit and dress pants next so I'm going to back to see Anas again soon for sure. This was the best customer service experience I have had in a long time... thanks Anas and thank you Suit Co.<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>I thought I would purchase a nice 3 piece suit for my son's promotion, little did I know nothing was sent to be tailored, the suit was "missing" and the customer service was horrible.
The manager had no words but are you sure you didn't pick it up? After waiting 30 minutes, I had to literally go home, bring my son to try on another suit because I refused to allow the manager to measure someone else's kid because she thought it may fit. What type of morons would not indicate on a notice the child's measurements and really? Let's measure this customer's kid because it might fit?? Wow, never have I seen such unprofessionalism and lack of customer service from a manager. Would I shop there again?

I was looking for a navy blue suit for my wedding and had tried Men's Wearhouse but didn't find anything there under $750 and then I went to the suit co and Anas lived up to the reviews and found me two great suits for less than a third of the price. I couldn't decide between them and Anas gave me a great deal for buying both of them. Definitely coming back whenever I need another suit!</Review>

Anas got my Dad set up for my wedding. He was friendly, quick, and helped us make decisions about color combinations and alterations. He wasn't a high-pressure salesman which was refreshing. We were able to walk out with everthing we wanted for anow excellent price. Thank you Anas! I have never seen my Dad look so nice!</Review>

This place has sone of the best prices on engine parts for 22RE and 22RTE engines around. Definitely lower than LCEngineering. I've never purchased one of their long blocks but I haven't heard anything negative from people who have purchased their engines or complete heads. Shipping was very fairly priced and I will definitely purchase more parts from Yota1 Performance in the future!< /review>

And for the women in the front desk, they were awesome. Highly recommend this place. Mahalo for the best service and product. Yota1 definitely got fans here on Maui. ALOHA🤙🏻🤙🏻</Review></record>

Yota 1 is without a doubt, one of the most professional shops I have had they pleasure of doing business with! They're true professionals and very knowledgeable when it comes to Toyota's.  They made me feel very comfortable while my truck was at their shop and always kept me informed so there were no "surprise" repairs or cost. If I ever had any further problems with my Toyota pickup, I would not hesitate to go to them for repairs! I will continue to refer them as they are 100% reliable and trustworthy! Thanks Yota1</Text>

I have not been in their shop but I just ordered a rebuilt 22re from them. Nick was extremely helpful and friendly helping me determine where the upgrades were worth the $ for my particular use. I called a few shops and Nick was by far the most helpful and knowledgeable person I spoke with. My only complaint is that they are in California and not closer to me in Arizona! This seems like a top quality facility run by people who care.</review>

I came here on 11-8-17 to get my flywheel resurfaced. I waited for the shop to open up so I can give them the flywheel. I could've went to other shops close by that opened earlier but I went to this one because of the good feedback I heard and it's all true.
They do great work and I was able to leave happily.

Will definitely come again.< /Text>

We travel from Napa to this amazeing place just outside of Modesto, the labor price is fair, fast reasonable diagnostic and amazeing warranties, we take the Company Rock Crawler here for all the repairs because this shop is well worth the drive.

I have never been to the shop itself however I have had an absolutely astounding expierence through the website and email. First of all they sell real genuine quality parts at unbelievibly low prices. On top of that the employees and owners of the company, have given me nothing but excellent customer service with any problems or questions I have had. I couldn’t recommend a better company to go through for Toyota parts and in terms of Toyota I have looked everywhere for my parts. I highly recommend them to you and even my mom (;<//Text>

I've also purchased a $3,000 performance motor that went out in less than 10000 miles.
Pick-n-Pull has better quality and services than what you should recive at yota 1.< /Text>< Time>

<Review>Great for propane fills. They do check the date stamped on the tank to make sure the date is within 10 years. Otherwise they won't fill. They charge by the gallon instead of a flat price. No minimum fill charge</Review>< UserId.>

My experience here was stellar. I had a hitch installed on my 2011 Prius and the manager/owner took it into his own hands to make sure I could get it installed in a timely fashion despite it being a busy day. Amazing service!</Review>

<Text>I’ve reserved trailers here twice in the last 9 months.  Both times I got a call the day before saying they didn’t have the trailer available at this location, even though I’d reserved it there. Both times they sent me to Simi Valley instead. This time they don’t have any of the trailers I reserved anywhere nearby and changed me to a much larger one, that I can’t actually use. I also can’t go to Simi Valley to get it when I need it, so I’m without a trailer.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This has been my goto location for a U-Haul for a few years now. The staff is so kind and helpful that I’d rather change my plans just to use this location when I need to rent. I’ve never had a problem with any of the vehicles or issues renting. The mobile phone pickup still requires you to go inside although after hours pickups use a combination lock to get your key. The check in process is also very good.</Review>

Needed a 6x12 no ramp trailer to move 35 years of accumulation from my dads place.The equipment I needed was always available and I was in and out in under 10 minutes each time.
Returns were just as easy.
Hope I never have to do that again. If I do, I know where to get the gear I need.
Thanx guys,gr8 job!</Text>

We went by for propane. The U-haul representative was not friendly or helpful. What was even worse, he let a man with a handheld tank cut in front of us then spent 10 minutes talking and filling his propane. We had an RV and were women so I guess we don’t count. We won’t be back that is for sure.<//text>

Needed a pickup for a few hours. Getting the paperwork done was easy, the pickup was driven to the front and it was filthy. I mean bad dirty, trash in the back, cigarette butts, cab stunk and had dried mud all over it.

I questioned this and was told this was all they had today yet 5 other GMC pickups were out front. I said I want it noted so I don't have to pay for it.

Luckily the same guy who rented it was the guy who did the return. Man it must suck to work here as they just did not care and drove the truck off.< /Review><gmapID>0x80e8271190b31e6d:0x72eb1d95fea4c5dc<//gmapID>< response>

Horrible service. They are ridiculous. They ask you not only for your phone number, but a second number, and then a THIRD phone number!! If god forbid you dont have a THIRD number, they REFUSE service!! Never rent from Harrison.  This guy cares less about his customers.</Review>

<user_id>117145371325924816223<//user_id><Text>Just had them install wiring harness for rental trailer. On the way home, we thought the steering felt "funny" so took it in to have it checked. They wrapped the wiring AROUND the steering column. Turning to the right pulled it tight, so within 10 miles, it had pulled off the battery. At the repair shop, they showed me the frayed wire by the battery, the wire wrapped around the steering column, and additional parts of the wire that were already stripped. Nice & safe, huh? Thought it was a professional job?

While I'm trying to contact U-Haul to get a refund for that nightmare, (which so far I haven't been able to contact anybody helpful), we get a text that the trailer we want "isn't available" at our location in spite of our "reservation" so now we will have to drive to another town 10 miles away to pick it up on move day.

This is not my first negative experience with U-Haul, and I honestly can't remember a single positive experience with them, anywhere. Will not EVER use again. Worst moving experiences ever.</Text>< Name>

Not willing to lift a hand or help me bring my boxes in for a refund.  She literally watched me walk and struggle to carry them all the way to the register.  She just stood there.  Then proceeded to tell me I could not get a refund because I didn't have my receipt.  I didn't need a store credit, I'm done moving for crying out loud and the boxes say UHaul all over them.  She said she was the manager and there was no one else I could speak to.  Surely there are other locations that you can use.  DON'T go to this one.  I walked out without a refund and left them their stupid boxes, which I no longer need because, "People, I'm DONE moving!"<//text>< Pictures>

Made reservation and after an hour I left with no equipment becuse the assistant manager said my card did not go through. I had already paid a driver to meet me at U-HAUL Agoura, so I’m out $60 so far. Returned next morning a day behind in my move to find out my bank account had been charged with 12 seperate transactions the night before ( I left bc they couldn’t charge my card), leaving my account too low to rent anything now!!!. The assistant manger who did those transactions was not concerned not helpful and didn’t once even hint at being sorry that he bombed my bank account and made it impossible to move - I cannot move becuse there is a ‘hold’ on $278.80 if my money in my account. That is a HUGE problem for me, not to mention I will not have enough funds to live on for myself and my two young kids for the next week. And your assistant manger told me- don’t know, can’t help you. My money will be returned in 7 days or so Peru bank.
This is so unacceptable, but what made me take time out of my day to report this is the total lack of interest U-HAUL employees showed for a disaster THEY caused. So far making my reservation with U-Haul has cost me $279 + $60 for driver that never drove, plus I’ve got another trailer sitting at another storage that I had delivered.
Not a good deal at all. So far I’m out $340 but don’t have anything to show for it and now I can’t adford to get alternative now.<//Review>

<review>Christina is possibly the best employee of any business I have ever done business with. She is the only person that keeps this review from being a one star rating.

Alex, Yvette, and Meredith, however, leave much to be desired. I had scheduled a pickup of my UBoxes for 15Jul back in April, but when I called Alex at 1pm on 15Jul, he kept telling me that he would call me back in 20 minutes, only to have me end up calling him after 30 minutes of waiting. After 3 rounds of this, he went home without telling anybody that I was still waiting. Meredith transferred me straight to the National Call Center without even telling me she was transferring me at all. Yvette basically shrugged the whole thing off as no big deal, and didn't call me back when I left my number for her a second time.<//review><Rating>3<//Rating><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Was in & out of there with a truck in just about 10 minutes. Truck had 1000 miles on it and was the nicest truck you could ever want to get for moving some things (I was expecting a beat up one LOL!). Staff bent over backward to accommodate me, saying I could keep the truck longer than the rental period (overnight) without additional charge. Dropped off after hours and the receipt they emailed me was just right. No surprises.

The other reviews had me worried, so I wanted to post this to reassure that they are fine, and I'm sorry I wasted a minute worrying about them. This U-Haul is excellent, and I will use again.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Incredibly slow service due to incredibly poor service design.  They only had one clerk that was in charge of all transactions including getting the trucks that were rented and hooking up the trailers that were rented.  So start to finish with each customer.  I have no idea what all the other employees were doing but some of them looked very under utilized.  So if you just wanted to buy some moving materials you had to stand in the same line as those that were renting trucks and trailers.  The paperwork process for renting was painfully slow too.

So after a 40 minutes to get through three truck rentals, they told me they didn't have the trailer that I reserved and I had to go to Simi valley though the email I got to confirm the reservation said Agoura.  At least the Simi location was much much much faster.< /review></record>

Ordered a 15ft truck, received confirmation for it the day before.  Arrived the following day and they told me they had my truck, but it was in Ventura. I explained that I had ordered it to their Agoura location and that I received confirmation the day before. The lady at the desk said, "hmm, strange" and then proceeded to not help me. I asked if they could drive the truck up so that I could pick it up in a few hours. They said they did not have any additional drivers. I ended up having to cut my losses and go with a smaller truck that they had on site with the promise that I'd receive an extra 50 miles for free (lucky me!). When I dropped the Uhaul off I was told that I went over my mile limit and charged an extra $20 although that's physically impossible based on the locations I drove to and from. All in all, this was one of the worst customer service experiences of my life. Thanks uhaul!< /review>

I made a reservation to have a trailer hitch installed on my car for a Fri morning at 7:30. I show up at 7:30 and they say their hitch installer won't be in until 11:30. I ask them to try to call him to see if he'll come in earlier and they call but of course he doesn't pick up. I asked them to keep checking and call my cell if they reach him but I never heard anything. I returned at 11:30 and they tell me they can't install my hitch because they poured cement the night before and it was still wet. I offered them suggestions on ways to get my car over the cement w/o damaging the finish but they didn't take them. They then sent me to the Uhaul in Chatsworth and it took them 5 hours to do a 3 hour job. Overall my experience w/ the Agoura Uhaul was TERRIBLE. The staff was completly worthless, unhelpful and did not have a solution oriented attitude. Overall I would NOT recommend anyone going there.< /Text>

<Text>The manager refused to refund us the $1.50 for air fill when the air pump was broken, and continued to not put a sign to warn others before they drop their quarters. Seems like a scam. The attendant was amazingly nice and tried to offer his own money to us so we could fill at another station, but the manager in charge was awful.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80db8b355960f749:0xb8c2f5f6dd0e5270< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The owner is always welcoming. Great sense of humor. If you ask for something he doesn't stock, he will try to get it.</Text>

Spacious and good machines!
This gym is relatively new, therefore,  it has a lot of new machines,  and you don't have to wait to use them,  or the wait is under 5 minutes in my personal experience.  The locker room is very clean and spacious too,  with a lot of TV turned on to entertain you.
However,  the abdominal bench,  I still like the old style one,  since the new ones are very heavy and hard to pull up, so I get discouraged and stop using them.<//Text>

Extremely happy with this location. Towel service, cleanliness, functioning machines, friendly staff, and they even have those little bags for wet clothes. No complaints whatsoever, solid af.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I just recently started frequenting this 24 because it is so close to me. I am definitely happy with this place. The staff here is really nice. The atmosphere is nice, it is not generally packed full of people so you are not stuck waiting to get your workout done. The machines work great, and the basketball court is pretty cool. The other gymgoers are also pretty conscious of others and friendly which makes the super sport pretty awesome. I am glad I decided to pick this location< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>24hrs fitness gym closes at 11pm when I arrived and was ready to work out. HELLO?!!! It’s called 24hrs for a reason, no??? And if it were to close early, the sales guy should have at least informed me of the change or some kind of announcement should have been made. I got dressed, drove here and ready to work out but it’s closed!!!? WHAT<//review>< gmapID>

Lots of room and equipment to use with plenty of wipe down resources. Battle ropes, squat racks, free weights and machines this place has everything except chalk for hand sweat/grip.<//Review>

The sole reason for the one star is due to the kids club shutting down. How else can parents workout? For parents this is the most essential part of their gym membership. The excuse is it's costing too much to keep it open. Then shorten the kids club hours, not take it away completely. Don't do this to parents, 24!< /review>

<text>This gym since open last year the service and cleaners get worse I know manager probably all he care are the number of new members they can bring in.but how about assistant manager or operation manager who should watch over the staff most the staff they stand in front desk  greeting  the member coming in going out and fold Towel seems that’s all they do when you tell them something need it attention they don’t follow through and give you all kind of excuses say no manager that’s why they can get thing done I missed  previously  assistant manager Lori she did a great job but unfortunately she transferred to city of industry and I heard my friend who go that location told me since she’s there the club improved a lot what the good  management team can make a difference in the club< /text><username>Vera Holloway<//username><Rate>1</Rate></record>

My wife and I are members of 24 hour fitness for years now. While my son and I are waiting for my wife my son needs to go to the rest room and guess what? They did not let my 14 year son go to the restroom. The guy from the counter who doesn’t care told my son that it’s for members only? That’s how bad this company to refuse restroom to a 14 year old. It happened today January 16, 2020 8:25 pm.< /review>

Love the staff and classes here. Keep it up. The down side is no punching bag for a super sport and the video/virtual classes are boring.< /Text>

A very nice club! Very well equipt, well lit and bright. Conducive to a good workout. I was impressed with their spinning room with a monitor showing  a simulated road condition. Nice touch. I'm going to be here a lot!< /Text>

<Text>It's new so the equipment is still nice and the place doesn't stink. It's a big gym so you'll likely find an open station, even when busy. You can always detour to another station if the one you want is busy, and then go back to the one you want later. Lots of treadmills, stair climbers, squat racks, etc. You can even do yoga or cycling classes, or even ball it up on the court. Been going here a few months and I still haven't tried all the amenities... There's so many. It's a Sport.<//Text>< Time>

One of the cleanest and well-organized Super-Sports I've been to; I arrived around 0730 and there was a bunch of parking, a bunch of the cardio/machines were available and operational, the weights were racked properly and everything was clean.

Might be the best 24hr in the area

You really can't ask for more (actually the 24 in La Jolla has an outdoor training area which more places should have)</Review>

I've been going here since it opened and would highly recommend a trainer if you're trying to get motivated and need to get over feeling awkward at the gym. Soon you'll not even realize there are people around because you will be focused. My favorite thing to do at this gym by far is Wednesday's and Saturdays bodyflow class. It's the best for endurance, core strength, stretching, and relaxing.< /review>

Great gym, much cleaner with more equipment than other 24s like Puente Hills. I would recommend, if you can, to buy the 2 year pass from costco. Save yourself money in the long run and don't have to pay the annual maintenance fee if you are paying monthly.</Review>

<Text>I started going to the Walnut gym last July.  Although this facility has a number of different kinds of machines compared to other 24Hr Fitness facilities, it's always good to be educated on how to effectively use them.  I had the pleasure of meeting and be trained by Kiyo as to which machines would be beneficial for the results I'm trying to accomplish.  Thanks to Kiyo's brief training which gives me the knowledge to maximize my workout to reach my goal quickly.  Kiyo is friendly, professional, patience, and very personable.  He presented the PT plans, but was not too pushy.  He was welcoming to showing me the other machines that are of interest to me in the future.  He's a good representative of 24 Hr Fitness.  Kudos to him👏👏👏< /Text><UserId.>100680461148860432567<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x80c32a269eb1a391:0x9204f5c2c79087ec<//gmap_id></record>

rejoined 24 hrs for this location. I quit on them years ago as the pool in  Puente Hills mall location got crowded and dirty. The pool in Walnut is clean and equipment are new. I can always find the equipment to use without long waiting. Glad I'm back to 24 hours again.< /Text>

My favorite gym ever. It is new, so yeah it doesn't smell yet and all the machines still match and are newer than other 24s. I've been going here since opening day and it's still just as clean though and it's been a few months. I used to live 5 mins away, but had to move to chino. I drive 20 mins now to still go to this gym, even though there's another super sport in chino. This 24 just has the best vibes and I get the best work out here. There aren't clicks or groups of annoying people hogging up certain areas.<//review>

This place is amazing but it'd be nice if they were to put on here that it's a super sport not just a normal 24 hour fitness you have to pay more to come here but definitely worth it. I'll upgrade my pass just to use this gym</review>

<review>Very nice inside and nice people but unless you have the top plan with 24hour fitness you can not get in just be informed before you drive to this location 3 other people and myself walked up not knowing and we got turned away unless we wanted to upgrade from the 29.99$ - 39.99$ a month not a big deal but just FYI people that didn't know about the upgrade plan for the super 24 locations</review>< gmapID>

<text>They took away the towel service not to "go green" because if they were going green they would never have offered it to begin with. Instead, it's an attempt to lower their overhead and increase profits. And then they decide to jack up membership prices. Shame on you, 24!</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<rate>4<//rate><review>(Translated by Google) The two-year package I bought at Cass is a lot cheaper. Otherwise, it is more expensive to do the card here than the other ordinary 24 hours. After all, this is the so-called super shop. The store is indeed bigger than the other ordinary 24, and there are many devices and new ones. There are more people coming to work from Monday to Friday, and try to avoid this. Then there were more people on Saturday morning, and I suggested avoiding it. What's next to the XLB...not recommended

(Original)
我在卡斯扣儿买的两年套餐，便宜了不少。否则在这儿办卡要比其它普通的24小时贵。毕竟这是所谓的超级店铺嘛。店里确实比别的普通的24大，设备也多，也新。每周一到周五的下班点儿人也多着呢，尽量避开这个点儿。然后周六上午人也多，建议避开。旁边的XLB什么玩意儿...不推荐</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Friendly and attentive staff to assist. Ample space to move about, however the space is a bit smallish given the number of different items they have for sale. The cashier was ok... But she came across as insincere and going thru the motions. The manager appeared to be genuinely helpful if not a tad over anxious to assist. Great job overall.</Review><userid>114461532283287386950< /userid><Rate>4< /Rate><username>Everett Diego<//username><gmapID>0x80d94de704643875:0x21e5ef92ab6da861< /gmapID><time>1592593067019<//time>< Response>

We went there to just look, they were so nice we ended up spending huge bucks 😂 We gave the guy a run around but I hope that our purchase made it worth it for him. Would definitely go there again. And maybe next time we won't give them the run-around haha<//Review>

Great associates and always friendly when you're there. Shoes could be in more sizes but that's just because they're in a popular area so they're probably selling out quickly</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) This establishment has a very good location with easy access. In a square whose parking is free and quite large.
Talking about the store itself, it is quite comfortable to attend to buy your favorite products since they have a wide variety of styles and are products of excellent quality, the prices considered to be accessible.
The staff that works in this place are really very friendly.
I have to accept that every time I go to a Vans store, I always leave completely satisfied with my purchases.

In-n-Out is been a stable during road trips visiting families in Southern California. This is no exception, cheeseburger and fries for four, fresh veggies, beef cooked just right and animal style takes it to another level of tasty burger. Due to COVID-19 self serve drink station was closed, you could still get refills and water. Good service, staff was very welcoming while they take your order.<//Review>

<Review>A California institution. I grew up in Southern California and now only pass through; however, I always make a point stopping at an In-N-Out Burger at least once. My usual order is a 3x3 and well-done fries (animal style) and I am rarely (if ever) disappointed.<//Review><username>Joel Berkowitz< /username>< time>

Covid update 5/2021:
Drive through and limited dine in with 6 feet social distance available. Plenty of outdoor seating with umbrella shades. Long drive through lines but there is a clerk walking up and down drive through line to speed up process.

Plenty of parking for cars and SUV. RV and Semi will need to park at the lower open lot and walk up. Orders are relatively fast. Ordering lines can extend out side but it moves fairly quick. Very tasty French fries thats quite unique in texture. They offer Coke products.</text>

<Review>Great burgers as always. Love my double double animal style.

I must have hit the lottery for their drive through as I only had a couple cars in front of me, vs the endless lines all day at every other location around. :)<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< rate>

<Review>This is a good stop to make not much else around. In-N-Out is the best so don't waste your time with other fast food options. Line is long but moves fast. Drive through or order inside and there is outside seating and clean bathrooms.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x864e9f98620c4dd9:0x6de05b09ecac81a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I recently went here yesterday and unfortunately ended up with food poisoning. They need to ensure they are cleaning properly and no cross- contamination. My son and I ended in the hospital. Within hours our stomach started hurting after eating here. Never coming back. One of the reasons I hate eating out. 😒</Review>

I like having cheeseburger in In-N-Out Burgers, their regular burgers are kind of dry. Other than that, this is one of our favorite place for quick, fast food.</text>

Here is without a doubt the best burger place and unfortunately it’s only on the west coast. I have at least one of their T shirts . They set the bar for fast food done right, as long as your just looking for burgers and fries.</Review>

Delicious food as always.  The employee who took my order was friendly, courteous and helpful in customizing my order.  I had opted to go inside to order since there was a long line at the drive through.  I did not have to wait long for my food.  All of  the employees were wearing gloves and masks and they all seemed to work well with each other while each one was busy with their own task.  I've noticed that all In-N-Out employees, for the most part, work hard and seem happy. The Kettlmen City, California location is no exception.  Thank you In-N-Out for a great eating out experience.< /review>

<review>I've never understood the hype around in-n-out.  Their burgers are just ok. Their fries taste undercooked.  If I need to order from a secret menu then why not make it the main menu?
They do have really good prices which is why I give them 3 stars, but overall their burgers don't break my fast food top 10.<//review>< Pics>

Ok were in Covid . We are on a road trip. Travel restrictions are lifted. Were in Kettleman City. Pretty much an armpit... RIGHT!   We have been driving for about 4 hrs or so need a potty break. All the other businesses really locked down Sorry no bathroom service oh but you can spend your money. Which i think is Big Bull malarkey.
Thank the lord for In & Out because that is what its all about..
Clean  stocked up restrooms courteous employees and oh my the single patty burger with grilled onions 🌰  was yum 😋  ie. Thank you Kettleman in and out. God bless and keep your selfs safe.<//text>

<date>1606091003303</date><text>11/20/2020 the lines are long, but thanks to In-N-Out in their ruthless efficiency the wait time is fairly short

It's worth noting that due to Covid the indoor seating is closed, and they're only letting a limited number of people inside at a time for takeout - so there's a line at the door.

One bonus is that at least this store takes Google/Samsung/Apple Pay< /text>< rate>

They were so nice and quick when I went inside. Fast food done right, not just favoring drive-thru stats.</Review>

In-N-Out Burger is the most consistent in quality of all burger stands. This includes A & W which I think has the best Double Bacon Cheeseburger anywhere.  But they have a couple of places that are not as good as they should be.   IN-N-OUT Burgers are all the same all menus are the same and the quality of their products are very very good.<//review>

In-N-Out never disappoints. Most people will take their orders to go, so be warned. The drive thru lines are quite long. It took us about 45 minutes from when we got in line, till when he left with our food.

But the food. My oh my was it good. The food is always good, just the wait is what was bad. The saying good things come to those who wait is true when it come to this place.</text>

I really appreciated this in-n-out for its women’s restroom. There were 7-8 stalls plus a nice large space (not in a stall) that had a pull down changing table. I’m sure a lot of thought and consideration for women’s needs (# of stalls) went into this because my husband said the men’s restroom had 2 stalls + a urinal.<//Text>

Perfect pit-stop for road trips between NorCal and SoCal. Stop by for great (as always) In'n'Out. Parking is ample, service is perfect, and there's plenty of other things to grab nearby to if needed. 5/5 always.<//text>

< Review>
In N Out quality and management = Mcdonald's and Burger King!  We ordered a double double with animal style and a cheeseburger with onions.  They switched it.  Then when I mentioned it to the manager, Robert, he sent it to the prep lady with glasses and told her to just switch the buns. Bottom Line, the animal style was mixed with the non animal style. I told him it is not right, Robert said they are busy. Totally not the service expected of in n out! I guess you can just switch buns and make a crappy burger and call it good... I thought In N Out was about quality. I obviously was wrong.  Totally unacceptable!<//Review>

A standard In-in-Out but at a very convenient spot if you're driving between LA and Sacramento area. It has a spot for dogs on one side with poop bags, a trash can, and a place to walk your dog a bit.< /review>

< Review>
This is a standard In-N-Out, but with a twist: it's conveniently located in the middle of nowhere next to the 5 freeway. As is expected, service is prompt and food is delicious. There's also plenty of parking to take a break from driving, eat in your car, and do some stretches. Just be warned: you're definitely not the only one hoping to grab In-N-Out for lunch. The line will be long.< /Review>

<Time>1601241577042</Time><rate>5< /rate><Text>This is a standard In-N-Out, but with a twist: it's conveniently located in the middle of nowhere next to the 5 freeway. As is expected, service is prompt and food is delicious. There's also plenty of parking to take a break from driving, eat in your car, and do some stretches. Just be warned: you're definitely not the only one hoping to grab In-N-Out for lunch. The line will be long.<//Text>< pics>

A standard In-in-Out but at a very convenient spot if you're driving between LA and Sacramento area. It has a spot for dogs on one side with poop bags, a trash can, and a place to walk your dog a bit.<//text>

Yum. Basics done right. You can always count on In-N-Out for yummy burgers, fries, shakes.
Helpful, friendly, efficient staff. Clean restaurant, good safety protocols. I appreciated how they limited the number of customers going inside, even if that meant waiting outside in the sun.</Review>

Best fast food cheeseburger money can buy. Ice cold rootbeer to wash it down. Fries could use some work...might just order 2 cheeseburgers next time! 😄 I like to add pickles, remove tomato...also fun to do animal style sometimes!< /Text>

When I arrived there were no cars at all in the Drive-Thru I ordered inside along with two others. We waited a long time while the staff proceeded to prepare all the new drive-thru orders which arrived after us. There were at least six. Then, I believe there was a new trainee and the burger preparer was holding the burgers right up to his face so he could see how they were put together. They were wearing masks but I still don't like my food being held up 6 in to someone's face. I travel that route 5 times a week and always stop at this location at least three times a week. This however will be my last stop. Not that it matters this restaurant makes phenomenal money and has a great reputation. I will still enjoy in and out at other locations<//text>< Pics>

Despite people being crazy over in and out I never shared that enthusiasm. The bun is always soggy and the fries are not crispy.< /Text>

Always a dependable experience, not just the best burger you can buy. Famous for fast service, they also feature a lot of shaded outdoor seating. Everyone should know by now that items "off-menu" are available, like a burger wrapped in lettuce in place of the bun, triple and quadruplestacked burgers, et cetera. And if your neighbors are chatty, enjoy their company: I'll bet that they are YOUR kind of people 😉.<//Text>

In n out always has really nice staff, except for lardy Angie who wasn't such a delight. I don't know why she's so upset, she gets free burgers. Maybe she should cutdown on them and go work for McDonald's instead with that attitude.< /review>< Pictures>

I love the location in Kettleman City, right off I5.  the burger is consistantly good at all In-N-Out’s, the problem is the same; you are never in and out.  The drive through takes forever, and if you go in it seems the drive through takes precedence.  To be honest, there are many other choices at this location, and since I am always passing through here, I think I’ll go to another choice to save time.<//text>

<text>I'm sorry. I know everyone really loves IN N OUT, but with a limited menu and fries that are nowhere as good as Five Guys (or any other fast food joint), I can't give them a rating above 3 stars. The burgers are good but not GREAT.

The restaurant is clean. The service is great. But the food is only okay, to me.< /text>< Time>

First time trying this restaurant. It was off the highway so very busy. Even though the rush never ended, the staff was excellent in getting food out and served to the right customers. Tables were being busted as soon as people left, floors were exceptionally clean as well as the bathroom facilities. One of the best shakes I have had in a while. Wish more were located in the north.< /Text>

This place is still as popular as ever amid the covid-19 crisis.  Employees made sure that social distancing was enforced, periodic cleaning of the dining surfaces, the fountain drinks are there but no longer self serve.  There was only one dispenser for hand sanitizer located at the entrance.  The bathrooms needed more attention with cleaning.<//review>

I love having a quick bite on the road from a place that is the same at any location you find one.  The more I visit the more I appreciate them. I order my burger with onions grilled and extra tomatoes and Dr. Pepper to drink. I never have to explain my order,  they get it!  Look for the palm trees:)</review>

<username>renaygarseeya<//username><text>If you're traveling up/down California I-5 and you're looking for a place to take a break.
Then I recommend stopping in Kettleman City.
Many eateries to choose from but if you're in California you have to try In-N-Out Burger.<//text><gmap_id>0x864e9f98620c4dd9:0x6de05b09ecac81a<//gmap_id><rating>5<//rating><UserId.>106232994329050308551< /UserId.>< Resp>

In-n-out is always a good choice, bo matter where it is.  Luckily if you are on a road trip on the west coast, a location isn't too far away...</review>

<text>Place is clean. Service is great. I always make a stop there for a bite to eat. fully satisfied with the food and service. There is a lot of parking space. You can eat inside or outside (clean) the restaurant or drive through and eat in your car. I love the 3x3 and 4x4 meals with fresh fries.< /text><GmapID>0x864e9f98620c4dd9:0x6de05b09ecac81a< /GmapID>< time>

<Review>To get to this location, you can enter on the North if you are headed East. If you miss it, then turn after the Chevron and go around to South to enter. My family, and a whole bunch of others, like In-N-Out, so I eat there when they choose. They are consistent, and they work hard.</Review>< user_id>

Holiday travellers flock to this In-N-Out in Kettleman City which is about midway between LA and San Francisco. Quality is consistent all throughout the burger chain. Service is extremely quick. Make sure and order from their "secret  menu".</text>

we were on vacation and hungry and we saw the restaurant. It was a nice clean restaurant and the people were Helpful. Most of the time when we are traveling if we see In and Out Burgers we try to stop and eat as by our experience the food is always good and consistent. The service is also Consistently good. Every In-N-Out Burger that I have been has been nice and clean had this experience was also good.< /Text>

<text>It is 1:30 pm, the line is out the door, all types of humanity are present, why? To partake of the delicious hamburger that is made the way you like. For me, the double  double animal style, for the wife, hamburger, no onion, add pickles. Fries and a drink, 7 mins later, we are filling our stomachs. Just can't beat the In-N-Out experience.  Enjoy.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Always good takeout food and efficient service. Now a weird random comment. This place, brilliantly, had a super large women's room compared to the men's...which was very much appreciated.<//text>

This is just a stop off the highway and it shares a parking lot with McDonald's, which is kind of funny. This restaurant was packed when we were there, unlike McDonald's. The food was great, even though we had to wait a while to get it. I really appreciated the sauces!</review><user_id>110582209463979833835< /user_id>< Date>

Their Double-Doubles are the BEST cheeseburgers you will ever find. Ask for grilled onions on top of the two parties of meat, and the two slices of cheese, and it just gets better. Clean inside, friendly staff, fresh food. With bathrooms and ample parking. What more could you ask for.
Even their milkshakes are great. Enjoy!< /Review>

< review>
Busiest In-N-Out in California...Kettleman City location lies almost exactly between L.A. and S.F. and is always busy during lunch hours, any time of year. Often, we find tour busses there, which means 60 or more people from one vehicle. More often than not, there are lines outside the building. And yet, the organization, friendly staff, excellent work ethic and overall efficiency makes it do-able and still fairly fast. I have had my number be 30+ numbers behind who they are serving, and still get my food within 10 mins. Consistent quality, clean bathrooms. If you are traveling on I-5 and craving a burger and fries, this is the spot to visit.</review>

The food is typical In N Out, which means better than any other fast food you can find. Clean facilities with a good size do ning room and parking lot

Great place to stop on those long trips to/from northern to southern California.  Consistently have some decent prices on gasoline here as well so that definitely makes this exit preferable to others.< /Text>

Great location, right off of 5. Stop by for some quick food then get back on the road. The only issue is this place sometimes does get very crowded, but it is an In-N-Out so the know how to move a line pretty well.</text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>This is one of those town's I would normally just pass up, but it was a good place for a pit-stop, or at least I thought it was. Finding this restaurant is quite difficult as it requires a bunch of side streets to access. And getting out can be challenging as is finding the freeway.  Food is great as usual, but the location isn't! The entire area is a bit of a tourist trap as gas prices are much higher here than other places.</text>< pics>

Many will agree that they are BY FAR the BEST HAMBURGER "restaurant" out there. It's nice to see they maintain their high standards on food quality AND employee service, regardless how far you travel. You can always count on the best burger in town<//text>

The place was crowded,  so don't just stop in for a quick bite.  The food was excellent,  though.  The line for the bathroom was so long I could've peed my pants before I got to the front. Good burgers but too much tomato. Not coming again.</review>

This is always a great place to stop at for road trips! The in n out location is always clean and deals with huge lines quickly and efficiently. The whole area is great to stop at and use the restroom.< /review>

At the cheeseburger without onions, fries and a soda. The same old question where's the beef. Every trash can in the place was overflowing one of the dirtiest in and outside I've been at.  I wouldn't even say anything about that because they are always busy but this place was not busy at the time.<//text>

<Review>Can't go wrong when you visit In-N-Out Burger.  The double stack burger with the secret sauce is very delicious.  The fries are freshly made on site.  Those taste good with the secret sauce.  Customer service is always the best.  They deliver the food in a timely manner with friendly customer focus service.  The Arnold Palmer drink is one of my favorite drinks.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Many will agree that they are BY FAR the BEST HAMBURGER "restaurant" out there. It's nice to see they maintain their high standards on food quality AND employee service, regardless how far you travel. You can always count on the best burger in town<//Review>

Very clean restaurant with plenty of seating inside and outside. I ordered french fries which were delicious and a chocolate shake which I mostly threw away because it was too fluffy or full of air bubbles so to speak and did not have the texture of a milkshake at all. It was not very cold only cool, so I think maybe the temperature regulator on the shake machine was not turn to cold enough. I've had shakes it other In and Out Burgers and they were more like a real Shake thick and with ice crystals. There were a lot of people there today so maybe the machine was not given enough time to get the mixture cold enough. I ended up throwing the shake away from this In and Out Burger. My friend had a burger and she thought it was okay.</text>

In_N_Out is one of the best burger chains in California. They sell nothing but burgers frys and drinks. The hamburger patty's grade has changed since they 1st started. Clean and friendly service.  I went with a bus full of Housing Advocates and the ACLU.<//Review>

Driving past this restaurant, I decided to stop by for a snack.  I did not know that it would open at 10:30.  when I saw in the window that their employee was shaving while standing behind the counter.  I changed my mind about taking their burgers.< /review>

Clean restrooms, parking, and freshly prepared food. You really cannot ask for more from a burger joint. Entrance is a little hard to find, but makes since they have a corner location.<//Text>

<Text>Not bad. My food was correctly assembled. Cold fries were quickly exchanged for fresh when I asked. Then, a manager came by and replaced the entire order again with an absolutely fresh one, even though we had already eaten half the burgers. She wanted to be sure we enjoyed all our food fresh and at the same time. Nice.< /Text>< pics>

This park is not like the small one in Paris. Also Galaxy's Edge is beautiful but I really would prefer to see the missing attraction.</Review>< Pictures>

This is where I learned that I had a sunburn in my leg simply from driving.  This review is to raise awareness for the dangers of the sun. 🔥    anyways.  No it's not.  This was actually funny.   But the 4x4 animal style, and the animal fries were on point!  Great spot to grab some great grub!< /review>

Good burger. I liked the double-double and the pickled chilies. Soft drinks free refill. Efficient kitchen, professional staff. The lady in the dining area keeping the tables clean at all times. She greet customers at the right moment and makes small talks. The lady makes eating burger at this establishment a very human experience.< /text>

Only big because of condiments. Much like steak n shake if familiar. Not bad in price for Cali, $7 and change for the meal.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Very nice associates. There was an issue and the cooks didn't get the tag for our order, and once the issue was noticed, they made the food and brought it out within something like five minutes. Order was exactly right and delicious! They handled the mistake very well, (even though my dad was not acting like the most patient person ever). Everything in the dining room and restroom was stocked and clean, too.< /review>

<username>Omar Reneau<//username><text>What else can I say. Its In-N-Out Burger. One of the best, if not, the best burger joint in California.  I know it's not the only place to get a burger, but the atmosphere and work ethics prove this place is your best choice. Easy Food menu to choose from and delicious fresh cut french fries. I highly recommend this place.< /text></record>

<Review>This place is across the street from a huge truck parking lot it's a super easy walk to get in and out of there... The food was made fresh and it was delicious! The french fries were perfect my milkshake was the right consistency and tasted great. I'm definitely going to go again.< /Review>< username>

I ate hear for the first time on my way to Texas! It was a fun experience. The line was through the door, but like the name , we were in and out! If I’m being completely honest, the burger was good, but not great. I was actually surprised how average it tasted, because I hear people ranting and raving about it all the time. We ordered our fries animal style, basically they add chili and secret sauce (1000 island), and that was also good but not great. The atmosphere was awesome, and I’d probably visit again. Kudos to the workers, they were working hard!</review>

If you're not originally from California, like me, you will arrive wondering why everyone here can't stop raving about In-n-Out.

Well, I'll tell you why:  It's good.  Really good.  But I'm not just talking about the food.  The place is well-staffed, extremely well-managed and *clean*.  And I'm not only talking about this location.  I'm talking about every one I've been to.  Every.  Single.  One.

For those of us who grew up on McDonald's in the 1970's, when it was a much better place than it eventually became, you owe it to yourself to brave the crowds and visit In-n-Out and see for yourself.

I'll never eat McDonald's again.</Review>

Upholding the high standards we have come to expect from this franchise, you will not be dissemination. And in one of the highest traffic areas in California, the employees were fast, efficient and very pleasant toward everyone in every circumstance.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

A little bit pricier than your hometown In-N-Out, but it's probably because of all the road tripping business it gets along the 5. As always, the burger was a steal for a savory and delicious bite. The vegetables tasted super fresh, and the meat was juicy and satisfying after a long drive.

My fellow travelers and I got our food surprisingly quick, even though the place was packed to the gillies with other travelers. The staff really knows how to run a well-oiled machine!</Text>

No need to say much about this company. Good food and great service. This specific location is Crazy busy. Do not recommend stopping by. Line out the door to order and out to the main street for the drive through.<//text>

If you're not originally from California, like me, you will arrive wondering why everyone here can't stop raving about In-n-Out.

Well, I'll tell you why:  It's good.  Really good.  But I'm not just talking about the food.  The place is well-staffed, extremely well-managed and *clean*.  And I'm not only talking about this location.  I'm talking about every one I've been to.  Every.  Single.  One.

For those of us who grew up on McDonald's in the 1970's, when it was a much better place than it eventually became, you owe it to yourself to brave the crowds and visit In-n-Out and see for yourself.

I'll never eat McDonald's again.< /text>

This has been our go to stop midway between L.A. and San Jose for the last three years, but recently has gotten crowded (good for business) but bad for us. People don't know how to maneuver parking lots, the bathrooms are now disgusting, and the wait for food just takes too long. It used to be a "quick stop" (15 minutes) but not anymore.<//review>

While driving down the I-5, we realized we were getting hungry as we approached Kettlemen City. Thankfully In n Out states open late so I ordered the first burger I've probably had in a year at 11 pm.

Delicious fries, iced tea, and the standard hamburger. Even though they were packed with a ton of new high school graduates celebrating on a Friday night, one employee offered to get our food when our number was called so that we wouldn't have to get up.

Super nice! Great food and awesome service; all night long!< /Text>

In n out is always a good place to have hamburgers but this place is a little cheaper than ones in bay area because of tax maybe.
Located in the middle of San Jose and LA so I always drive in to fuel and have a meal.< /text>

I frequent this restaurant in a regular basis when traveling. Employees are always very curtious while working in a fast paced environment. During the summer months this place is packed with the line to order going out the door. If you order burgers expect it to take 20 min or more to get your food. Which is not a complaint just FYI.</Review>

<Review>There are very long spaces between stops on Interstate 5 between Bakersfield/The Grapevine toward the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley and Stockton in the northern portion of the valley. Here is a bright spot in the southern area, and the In-N-Out was outstanding.
Upholding the high standards we have come to expect from this franchise, you will not be dissemination. And in one of the highest traffic areas in California, the employees were fast, efficient and very pleasant toward everyone in every circumstance.< /Review>< pics>

Taking the I-5 across California? Of course you have to stop at In-N-Out. This one at Kettleman City is my go-to, since it's about halfway along the drive in either direction. Standard In-N-Out conditions apply – clean restaurant, good food, good prices.< /Text>

I always visit this location on my 5 Freeway trips. Great service (even opened 10 mins early for my group's chartered bus, THUMBS UP :D). Food is like every other In N Out, simply DELICIOUS. Very clean too, both indoor and outdoor seating are well-kept. AWESOME place overall for a quick pit stop! :)<//review>

One of my favorite hamburger restaurants in California. That being said, this spot is fast and efficient, and of course the food is always good. Feel bad for the young lady taking our order outside in the hot sun. Anyways, despite the huge line, the line moved fast and the food as always good quality.</Text>

Great value. The cashiers are always pleasant. It's not a good place to go to meet up with a friend--it's too noisy to hold much of a coversation.  I wish that In-N-out had electronic boards displaying the customer's order number rather than hearing someone constantly yelling the order numbers. It's still one of my favorite fast food restaurants.< /text>

<Text>Super busy while traveling, but generally clean or close to it. Lots of bathroom stalls, and a changing station in the women's bathroom (not sure if there's one in the men's). Good sized parking lot including about 6 RV parking spaces. There's at least 5 tables outside, can't speak to how shady they are during the day as I've only been there around 5-6pm in the summer, but they were in the shade of the building by then. A few well used grassy areas to let your dog do its business. I don't think I've ever had trouble with the food, although they might have forgotten the ketchup packs one time. Just be sure to ask!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

One of my favorite hamburger restaurants in California. That being said, this spot is fast and efficient, and of course the food is always good. Feel bad for the young lady taking our order outside in the hot sun. Anyways, despite the huge line, the line moved fast and the food as always good quality.</Text>

Same old reliable fresh tasty burger but it is crazy busy during the holidays or long weekends. During holidays you can expect 25 minutes to get your food served and another 15 minutes to get out of the parking lot. Oh, good luck finding a table too. Other than, same friendly staff and great burgers.<//Text>

Super fast compared to all the other ones I've been to. All up and down California and even the one in Oregon, and this one was by far the fastest. We got number 78 and when we walked in they had called number 60, but still had our food within 5 minutes, and man was it delicious.</Text>

<Review>The burgers itself are of a nice texture and quality. Do mind their beef supplier. If you have ever driven on N5 from LA to SF you should know what am talking about.

<text>Everyone is nice and helpful, their prices are good, and they are very clean. Can be busy at times, but that is probably because they are a by a highway and the only city for miles.

CHECK YOUR ORDER! Out of 4 items that we ordered, 2 were wrong and one was missing. They did not have a huge line at the drive thru, nor in the restaurant itself. We ordered inside but made the mistake of leaving before checking. Total rip off since I paid for a double double and got a regular instead. How can you get an order wrong when not even busy?< /Text>

We always stop here when traveling and they always have the best and freshest tasting burgers and fries.  I have never gone through on a mega bus (nor will I) because this site is always bustling.  We just stopped in at 10:40 am and had a short wait but a line formed quickly behind us.< /Text>

Pretty busy place, it's crazy.  This people work really hard. We bought to go because this places was super full but anyway the hamburgers are ok nothing special but the vanilla shake is really good! I love it. You have free parking and it's close to de Avenue.  Follow me in Instagram and Facebook @HoppinCities for more reviews and places< /review>

Most In & Outs have friendly smiling staff, no matter how crowded the restaurant is with tourists or locals. This location is adjacent to very busy interstate highway. Woman (young person) taking orders was sullen. General overall "happy vibe" of I&O wasn't there.Best hamburger fast-food chain in CA.<//Review>

A California classic in-and-out Burger never fails to be a great adventure. If you've never had it it's a must try but I can't imagine anybody that lives in California that has not had it.< /Text>

<review>We always stop here when traveling and they always have the best and freshest tasting burgers and fries.  I have never gone through on a mega bus (nor will I) because this site is always bustling.  We just stopped in at 10:40 am and had a short wait but a line formed quickly behind us.<//review>< pics>

The food is always good, especially after a long drive. Why then the three stars? One star lost because of the bathrooms, they're tiny and inadequate for the number of people who come here. To give you a hint of the badness, there's almost always a wait for the guy's restroom. The second star was lost because of the indoor seating, many folks wait around for others to finish and then jump into their still warm seats. Over all, this In-N-Out is undersized for its location and popularity, by a large magnitude.<//text>

<text>Go right past the McDonald's next door and place your order at In-N-Out Burger. Don't think about it... Really... Just do it. The menu is simple, the food is awesome. I had the Double-Double cheeseburger... Just good food!</text>< pics>

In n Out is a great establishment, however this specific one is a huge tourist hotspot. There is always a line much longer than other In n Outs and that takes a toll on the staff and food quality. Even swinging in to use the bathroom real quick can be a mistake.< /text>

The food was great, just like any In-N-Out, but this particular one had a poor bathroom. The toilet seats were too small for the toilet. There was a flipped over wet floor sign in the middle of the bathroom, and the floor wasn't even wet. The mirrors were all foggy and faded, and the food preparation wasn't too good either. I witnessed an employee be careless with my food, and another employee even asked her why she did that. I wouldn't advise this particular location for an In-N-Out. Next time I am in this area, I'll most likely be trying out a different place to eat. :(< /text>

<text>Very busy location with many tourists/visitors stopping from I-5 but no sacrifice on customer service and food quality. I ordered a custom burger due to food allergies and it came out as ordered. Many thanks to the team there! During the busy lunch hours, they walked around to take customer trays and offered kids in-n-out paper hats.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Went there on the way back from Anaheim. Burgers and fries were delicious, as they had been on the way there. However, the drinks had a soapy taste, like chemicals. The town is known to have a toxic plant up the hill, blamed for birth defects in the town. When we asked about it, they first told us we were the first to complain. Later, however, the manager told us that they knew and that they were on the phone with someone about it, and said it was "not harmless as far as we know of". I love it there, but please be cautious with the drinks!!!< /Review>

Just stopped here real fast on the way back from Pismo going home to Modesto. The line was crazy long and the delivered the food light speed actually. No wonder they have so many people working at one time! I can even imagine where these people commute from since there is nothing else out here, they must pay good!< /Text>

A go to place when traveling around the I-5. This is like a midway point between SF and LA, so it's a great rest stop when eating a meal. In-n-out is always great to get, especially with Animal style (grilled onions and extra sauce) and extra toasted buns.<//text>

Honestly, I don't get it. People rave about this place. My third time and location. Every time the food is just mediocre. Clean and friendly environment, maybe that's the hook? Give it a shot see what you think.< /text>

It's In-N-Out. Just go. It's worth it. The fries are worth it. The burgers are worth it. The staff is friendly enough. The restaurant is usually crowded with sensible people who know their burgers are good. Just go. Eat. Regret.<//Text>

Just like any in n out shin dig but much busier. If it's a nice day out, during lunch rush, good luck finding parking & place to sit. Regular burgers come with raw onions but if you ask for grilled, it'll be just grilled that you get. They have grilled cheese (secret menu) which comes with pickles & can come with grilled or raw onions, probably even both. I wonder if the cows we driveby on highway 5 are what's for lunch. Anyway, one guy working here was very nice, clearing tables outside. Would come here again but try & stay away from their most busy times.< /review>

This is one of the best In-N-Out locations anywhere, and a good bet for a place to take a break on I-5.  It is always packed, and at peak times the line is out the door, but they are ready for it.  During the last visit they averaged well over two orders served per minute, so even with a long line out the door we were eating less than 10 minutes after parking.  And in the midst of that rush the food was still at its best.  Double-double gooey and delicious, perfectly cooked, but not even the skightest mess while eating it -- that takes a skill level you don't find at a lot of other In-N-Out locations.  Fries were very crisp and somewhat bland, easily fixed with some salt and pepper, as it should be so that you can season them to your liking.  Dining room and restrooms were very clean and in order, extra help was available to keep it that way.  If every In-N-Out were like this one, I'd put them on par with The Habit and Shake Shack, at least for quality and service.</Text>

I'm not  big of a fan but I'll give them a three, fries to crunchy and I don't love. The burger sauce but without the sauce I'd eat them, shakes are good also. The place clean and pretty quick and the o in smell will lure you over.<//review>

The people were friendly but the cheeseburger was terrible. It's way over salted and the sauce was nasty. I would go back for the fries those were awesome.<//Text>

HO-LY COW this place is PACKED and the line was seriously 30 min long. Stretched out the front door and into the parking lot. We stop here probably 3x year on our drive up north but I feel like the crowd gets worse every time. The food is great but they have got to get a handle on their overcrowding on holiday weekends. Thankfully the cashiers are super friendly!</text>

<Review>It's an In-N-Out that gets a lot of traffic being in Kettleman City, and getting to it is a bit miserable.  Seemed to be short staffed my last stop (after 8pm on a Monday), but past stops haven't been bad (relative to the number of people).  Food still came out as expected.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Text>I love In-N-Out, but something is wrong with this location's water.  I've been to this location twice (months apart) and both times the soda and water from the fountain tasted horrible (like soap and garden hose).  The food was delicious as always.

<text>Grab your burgers here before heading west towards the coast. I always try to stop here when passing through, because it's never quite as busy as their other locations near the cities. Fries are fresh as expected, burgers always juicy. Bathrooms looked a bit neglected, but that happens sometimes.</text><rating>4< /rating>< UserId.>

As with all In N Outs, the service is fast and the food is tasty.  We time our drives between northern and southern CA to ensure we can make a pit stop here.  The other options along I-5 are sub par compared to In N Out.<//Review>

<username>Joon Nam</username><Time>1485201110596</Time><rate>3< /rate><text>I like In-N-Out. In fact, I love the chain and its burgers. However, this location, being the last In-N-Out stop on the way to San Francisco on I-5 from LA, is usually quite packed with limited seats available. Therefore, unless you are doing drive through, I'd say stop ahead of time at another In-N-Out location.< /text>< pics>

I love the burgers, but I haven't gone there for about 8 months, ever since I found out that In-N-Out contributes to the Trump campaign, I will not being giving my money to a company that supports that Fool, just Google the company's or business that support him, you will be surprised!!!< /Text>

Fuel yourself up here, then fuel up your car before heading back on the road.  Check their secret menu in advance if you want some variety.  I recommend a Neapolitan shake and mustard fry cheeseburger, protein style.</Review>< Pics>

As with all In N Outs, the service is fast and the food is tasty.  We time our drives between northern and southern CA to ensure we can make a pit stop here.  The other options along I-5 are sub par compared to In N Out.</Review>

<Text>I'm trying to cut back on the red meat, but this place doesn't make it easy! There is no better place to eat near the halfway mark between the Bay area and Los Angeles on the 5. I won't even hold it against them that they got two of our four burgers slightly wrong last time.< /Text>< date>

This location didn't live up to the In-N-Out hype.  My order was wrong and the burger seemed dry.  It was still way way better than McDonald's. There was no one in the drive thru line which was rare!</review>

<text>I like In-N-Out. In fact, I love the chain and its burgers. However, this location, being the last In-N-Out stop on the way to San Francisco on I-5 from LA, is usually quite packed with limited seats available. Therefore, unless you are doing drive through, I'd say stop ahead of time at another In-N-Out location.< /text>< Pictures>

Great place to stop inf you are on I-5 and are halfway between SoCal and the Bay Area. If you have a dog they also have great outdoor seating.

Compared to most In-n-Outs this one's drive thru is much easier to access. It's also very long for when it's busy. Parking is extensive. Staff is very friendly as you'd expect at an in n out. 5 Stars when compared to other In-n-Outs.< /Review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>A very hot summer day--- staff very busy the store was full ........ yet all was working so well that for me was great
All the staff should be commended for the attention to duty, respect, and personal grooming all was perfect.
Management did not have to intervine at all while l was at the restaurant . In the contrary
they were also waiting on customers. ..
Will return to this store... and live in Wildomar  California.<//Review>< Pics>

Fastest service I have received in any In-N-Out. The drive through and the inside was packed with people and I still got my food within 10 minutes and the food was still great!< /Review>

<review>I did ot visit the In-N-Out burger there in Kettleman City but rather stopped at the Chevron station to get a soda. Kettleman City is a grat stopping-off place when you are going from the valley to the coast. LOTS of restaurants to pick from including the In-N-Out burger place. They have the BEST fries of all the fast-food places in my opinion.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This location was okay, but had an issue with multiple files in the place.  Not just 1 or 2, but more like 5 to 10.  Additionally the staff was not that great.  Someone spilled a drink in front of the couch ter, and instead of cleaning it up for them, they simply handed them napkins...</Text>

It's a nice location with fast service that you would expect from In n out. It can be crowded if you go during peak meal times but they are still quick and efficient.< /review>

This In-N-Out is one of the busiest I know of (and that can keep it from being clean), but the staff is very efficient and hard working, making this a great stop on any road trip through the central valley!< /Text>

We live a world of plenty gourmet burgers that are definitely superior, but In-N-Out is the best if you're on the road and need a decent meal< /review>

Seems that establishment using less spice on meat, smaller patty size. All in, burger had less flavor.  fries were dry and old, shakes slimey and not good, i guess the chain is tpo big and standardization has reduced quality< /review>

<rating>2< /rating><text>Over crowded.  Orders getting way mixed up when delivered.  Three orders were ready to be given to the customer but they totally lost track of the order number.  This led to customers taking the wrong orders and others waiting for their number, which will never be called because someone else already took their food.   What a mess.  If it's super crowded,  run away!< /text>< pics>

Generally great food, however fried were soggy. And restrooms needed lots of attention. Not the standard In-n-Out quality one would expect.</review>

An In-N-Out location as good as any other. However, due to it's location just of the freeway, at a popular stop, the drive thru line can be very long.< /text>

Had severely undercooked fries the last time I was here on a Megabus stop. Soggy and floppy flies are unacceptable, but I had no time to go back to complain since the service was so slow that the Megabus nearly left without me. Took about 20 minutes from when I ordered to when I received my food. Try the McDonald's next door if you're just stopping for Megabus.< /Review>

This location of in n out is always busy, but they're consistently quick and friendly, and their quality never slips. This is a travel route store, so it would be easy for them to just be rude and pushy because they know they'll get more customers if they lose some. Despite this, they remain kind and eager to please. This is one of our favorite places to stop on the way to the coast.<//Review>

This In-N-Out is located in a prime spot for travelers, yet somehow there is almost always a table open. My only complaint is that the entrance can be a little hard to find.<//text>

In-N-Out is always consistent in their quality. This location of the I-5 is no exception! The parking lot is medium sized and the drive thru line is well organized.  Service as usual is very snappy and courteous.  If you're in the area or going on a road trip,  In-N-Out is always a safe bet for food!<//review>
