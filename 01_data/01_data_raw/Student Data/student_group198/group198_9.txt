I absolutely love the wonderful, friendly people who work here.   Lynn and Mindy have become friends over the years.   They really do beautiful nails for my daughter and I.  Their staff is creative and equally important, very clean and safe.  I can't thank  them enough....just lovely.</Text>

Let me start off by saying that two of the eyebrow ladies here are wonderful. But let’s get Into the negative, right now dealing with homophobia and all I think it is very rude that they don’t want to attend a male for manicure because no lady was available only a male nail tech. It frustrates me how they said “ohh that’s weird” but why isn’t it weird when you get a haircut and a man is touching your head. I’m sorry I love this place and my girl Nicki but the men in this nail shop need to educate themselves.< /review>

I’ve been going here for two months. Everytime I have received excellent service from various nail technician. The price is right I get gel & a small amount of  acrylic to protect my own nails.  I don’t put personal phone I just have a cold and over my nails and they’ve been growing since I’ve been taking about calcium and vitamins.  Go here every two or three weeks.< /review>

<Text>So my toe nails came out really cute! But my nails, I was cut and the nail technician decided to paint around the cut? I asked for black and it looked black but it’s actually dark blue. The nails are super lumpy and dented. Then I was told it was going to be $14 dollars extra from the original $18 but in the end I was charged $47 and she said she told me it would be that much but I was never given this information.</Text>< pictures>

I have been patronizing this location for 9 years.
Nikki does the best nails and wax and Mindy is the only person, I will allow to do my pedicures, they are both kind and funny. The owner, Lynn is nice too. I have never had a problem with this shop.<//Review>

< Review>
I been coming for years here and always  been treat nice.. Until today the owner was really rude... I have an autistic son who was listening to music on my phone and she rudely told him to put the volume done.. I told her why.. She didn't reply.. I got my nails done and when I paid I told here improve your attitude.. She came outside and told me if I wanted to come back and do my nails not to bring my son no more.. She's their discriminating my son... Only because he wouldn't put the volume down.. Please help me get this around... That's just not right... I even told here put a sign in your window saying NO CHILDREN ALLOW and she walked away... No one was complaining but her.. Being the owner doesn't give her the right to treat people like that especially children with special needs....< /Review>

Awful place, will never go back again. You get what you pay for. Worst service every. And Lynn the lady in the front very very rude and short. I made and appointment for 1030 am I get there and have to wait over 30 so I walk out and went across  the street. Service was much better and waited 5 mins.< /Text>

<text>The woman who is at the front desk is very rude. I mentioned to her that I did not like my gel manicure and her response was, "well next time go with someone else."
Mary was the lady who did my gel manicure and pedicure. She doesn't understand a word you say to her. I asked her to polish my nails all the way to the top and to the edge of my nails, and she did not. Which means I'll probably have to get my nails done again in a week versus the usual 2 weeks.
I used to love coming here because the service was great and the prices were even better but the owner is rude and she does not care about service. The faster things get done the better for her.
Save your money and go elsewhere. I highly recommend Snow Nails in Rancho Cucamonga, I'd rather pay more and drive a little more to get better service!< /text>< Time>

<review>Where do I start? The customer service was poor, the salon was dirty, the staff was unprofessional, my nails look hideous, and I left bleeding. Not to mention one of the women who works there commented on my skin and said I should be using an organic cleanser on my face! I'll never go back!</review>< gmapID>

<Text>This place is the WORST place to go to. I got a pedicure and they literally put a bag over a storage container and put water and soap in there and then they proceeded to do my pedicure. I got  acrylics done as well and they were so thick and ugly. I will never return. Id rate 0 stars if i could.< /Text>< pictures>

Terrible service!! Just got my nails done there's chips in them, bubbles and a huge cut on my finger!! They charge for everything extra and have nerve to ask if you would like to add tip. The main lady can be very rude and crued as I witnessed her talking to a client! And don't make an appointment it doesn't matter you'll still have to wait!!</review>

<Review>I went in for a pedicure about a week ago 9/21/17.The lady that gave my a pedicure cut deep into the side of the skin on my big toe (very painful) but I thought it was sort of a normal thing since I hadn’t gotten a pedicure in about 3 months .The next day my toe was swollen and is still swollen to this day 9/24/17 I’ve never experienced this before & I’m disappointed that this happened.< /Review><Date>1506321954047< /Date>< user_id>

<Text>They had me waiting, soaking my feet in water for over 20 minutes. Meanwhile another person came in for a pedi and they assisted her first, while I continued to wait. I don’t mind waiting, what I didn’t like it’s being called and then having my feet soaked for a long time. Really bad service.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c334471a5074c5:0xcd06e887a20f4ac6</gmap_id><response>None< /response><time>1510366452506<//time><username>Marcela Cupps<//username>< rate>

Very nice place. Great easy relaxed environment. I especially love the hot towel treatment. It's been a long time since I've been to a barber shop that still uses scissors thank you Christina.< /review>

I made an appointment and I was more than 10 minutes late and they were really cool about it. It was the best haircut I had in a very long time. Exactly what I wanted and it came with an unexpected head massage and a hot towel. Christie was very professional .I will be back, positively!</Review>

Nice people, but terrible barber from my experience. I have no idea how these guys have such a high rating. You can be nice, welcoming, and offer little extras like a nice hot towel with your cut. But you at least have to know how to cut! And I’m NOT picky at all. That barber totally jacked up my hair and now I have to wait for it to grow back!</Text>

<review>Im not so sure what Ricardo is speaking about as ive been to a few barbers here in upland and while others give great cuts none quite give the same experience you will get here. Kristi and Vick are your go to an are amazing and always go above and beyond to ensure you leave with a great experience and looking good!<//review>< pictures>

< review>
I've been going here for a couple years now, however he(vic) always has new barbers coming in and out. I feel as if they're new students or something because they can never cut my hair right. Constantly getting nicked by the trimmers, my hair is never even on both sides. One side looks like a fade, the other a taper. I used to get my beard lined up from them. However the time before last I went in and the lady made my chin line up so crooked.

If you wanna get a haircut from here, only get it from vic. Dont get one from the other two girls he has working there. They do not know what they're doing. If I could rate just vic,  5 STARS. But I've legit received better haircuts at the 6 dollar hair salons then I do at this 19 dollar barber.< /review>

< Review>
Puppy wasn't anxious when we picked her up which was great. It was unclear how long she was out playing and socializing versus on her own in her kennel - need to ask more questions about the dogs schedule for exercise vs rest time.
Puppy has been throwing up a couple times since she came back... Not sure if it's related to something she picked up at the facility. Really hoping it's not related and clears up in its own.</Review>

<Time>1537769317818<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>This place is pretty pricey, but I feel so comfortable leaving my pet here. It's worth the money to know she is being cared for. She has stayed here twice and was remembered from the first visit. Staff is very friendly and the facility is clean. Much happier having her close to home rather than having to take her to Reno. Easy pick up and drop off.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIUSYb0Ep3m_XPkA5cGVHRqIpJP8imnsMd8FVc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

We dropped our 6 month old havanese here when we went to ski. He seemed like he had lots of fun as he was snoring on our way back. The drop off and pickup was quick and easy as I had made the reservation and uploaded his vaccination details online. The staff was friendly and responsive. They emailed me the estimated cost, check-in and check-out times. We also received the first day free as we were new customers. Would visit again.<//Review>

Took my bernese mountain dog there to be groomed. She came out super soft, fluffy, and most importantly, happy! I think she got to play with the other dogs out back while she was there. 10/10 will bring her back<//text>

< Review>
My puppy, ruthie, boots straight to them when we get there. So it makes me feel good about leaving her for the day. I check her after every pickup and there has not been an issue for me.

We've been here about 4 or 5 times now and have only done the Doggy daycare. Price has been straight forward for us everytime. I think it's the same amount to other doggy daycares in the area.

I have never gotten a card with ruthie's "report card" during any of my visits...I've seen people get them though so they do make a card haha which I was initially excited about because she hadn't ever been to a daycare before.

This will continue to be my winter daycare during the snowboarding season.< /Review>

Pros;  Very friendly staff. Clean facility. Didn't see play area (outdoor).
Cons: I suggest you ask right up front for the complete listing of charges and check out times.. We were told we wouldn't pay the daily fee, if we picked our dog up before noon. But, we were in fact charged about $18.00 for a morning playtime; since we didn't pick him up before 9 AM. This wasn't mentioned, or noted on their website.(At least not with the pricing and packages.)
Additionally, the 'first-time client special pricing' includes an additional fee, which was also never mentioned upfront.
These unexpected fees when we picked up our boy, just turned us off and left a bad impression about the place and business practices.<//Review>

Full of charges they tell you AFTER you go to pick up your pet.  Went to pick up my partner's dog after a one night stay, asked for an invoice and they said the computer wasn't responding. Noticed the payment requested was a little higher than my partner told me and not what I recall when bringing the dog in.  When I finally pressed and got the printout it clearly had charges that weren't requested.  I was there when we checked the dog in and nobody mentioned a "mandatory" pet care warrantee (nor did we sign off on one prior) and there was some type of "Olympian Packa" was added for another $25.  We were never informed, nor authorized this but at pick up was told it was "required"!!  Not in web site, nor at intake;  web site indicates that there are choices of "play packages" that CAN be chosen, not that "must" be chosen.  Now price of a pet board is near a one night stay at a hotel for a person when the only viewable price is not what it really is.  They keep some ratty copy of charges BEHIND the counter.  Bait and Switch!!  I asked what the charge was, and was told it was a "play package", so even though the dog is assured 3 "potty" breaks, presumably expected in an overnight ans standard at another nearby dog boarding facility, you are paying extra for that without notification.  Seems like workers will say (or not say) anything to make money and keep their jobs.</text>

<Text>4 - 5 years ago, I gave you the 5 stars rate because they did good care of my baby dog during we vacation and camp. My baby dog was happy and been fun with other dogs. My baby dog feels comfortable her room. They are so cute like a small hotel. 😍</Text>< Pics>

<Review>We could not be happier with our experience at Truckee-Tahoe pet lodge. Our dog is always so excited as we turn on to West River Street and he is always greeted with smiles and lots of love! In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to work and could spend every second with our pup but this is definitely the best alternative we could ever think of! The holiday and birthday parties are the best and the photos we are given as a keepsake are some of our most favorite photos of our four-legged friend! They are so accommodating and helpful! I recommend this place constantly to friends!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The employees here are all kind and caring and take great care of my animals.  The place isn't cheap, but it's well worth the money to have peace of mind and know that my pets are safe and well cared for while I'm out of town.< /text>

Great place to leave your fur babies when you want to ride the mountain with peace of mind. They have indoor and outdoor areas and feed food you bring. My Shiba had so much fun here. I'm not sure who is more exhausted at the end of the day :)< /Text>

Boarded my elderly chihuahua there for 10 days while visiting family who do not allow pets.  The staff were all wonderful and gave Maisy lots if attention.  They did not mind us popping in at all different times of the day to visit for a few minutes or take her out for an hour or two.<//Text>

Great doggy day care. My dog is a bit of an anti social but when i returned to pick him up in the afternoon, there he was on the video monitor, a social butterfly and interacting with all of the other dogs. Amazing!<//text>

Cassidy, Garnett, Colleen and the whole team there have treated me with the best service I could imagine over this past year. They go out of their way to create a one of a kind experience with your dogs and cats. The facility is very clean and customized to the level of comfort that you want your fur baby to have. They even hold fun events for holidays and your pets birthday where they take themed photos. Im currently looking at his picture from st. patty's day and Christmas on my desk lol. I could literally go on for days. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone looking for doggy day care or overnight lodging to please choose the pet lodge. I will be taking my pup here for the rest of his life. Thanks Guys!<//Text>< UserId.>

<review>This business really took care of me. They are well focused bringing excellent service to their customers. Mauro is great, very professional. Gets things done and will take care of you. I totally recommend E3 Collision. Emily is also great and very professional. Both her and Mauro took care of my 2017 Honda Accord and had it returned to me in very little time. Thank You E3 Collision. Thank You very much Mauro.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Perfection. These guys are all about getting it perfect. When my nearly new (just over 10,000 miles!) 4WD Chevy Tahoe Premier got rear-ended by a careless kid I was heartsick, believing it could never be returned to the new-shiny-solid we loved. One of the most sophisticated and complex vehicles Chevy makes, our Tahoe is absolutely loaded with every kind of computer-controlled, super-sensing device GM makes. And it's got extra towing muscle with it's large V-8 engine and full towing package to pull our RV.  What's more, our special-ordered paint (tri-color, pearlescent white) makes it beautiful to behold... but a very difficult paint-matching repair job!  Given all this complexity, I assumed that it would be nearly impossible to return to its near-new condition.

But the folks at E3 are a tenacious lot. They inspected and measured and ordered parts and repaired and worked with two Chevy dealers on some of the mechanical stuff (sometimes rejecting the dealer's work and insisting it be done over!). They were picky, inspecting and re-inspecting and not afraid to stop and order an obscure, deeply buried part that had minor damage and which might have been ignored because no one would ever notice it was broken. In short, they were aggressive and acted as our advocates with the insurance company and the dealer repair people throughout the entire repair process. Yes, it took a long time. But they essentially rebuilt our beautiful vehicle to their exacting standards. And what we got back was a is a Tahoe Premier that is just like new.

I highly recommed this family operation. You can trust them to deliver perfection as your collision repair, no matter how complicated your ride.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5nLFrCwsNjP4y4d32zcCznl4vUu3RDdoXzXeK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNC7ZI4-WmsZGAZ7PswtNMVqBX8ckEKl53Os3_s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

So happy we chose E3 collision to repair our truck. From the estimate to the body work done everything came out perfect no blemishes no orange peel on the paint truck looks exactly like it did when it rolled off the Chevy lot. Big thank you to Mauro who kept me in the loop through the whole process always called me to give me updates on the truck no run arounds took care of me 100% outstanding customer service. I would highly recommend E3 for any body work needs thanks again Mauro you rock! 🙌🏼< /review>

They were amazing. Not only was their pricing very reasonable, they went way above and beyond what I expected. I have a rather fancy car so I got a lot of places charging me the you-look-like-you-can-afford-more tax, but not this place, the price was very very very good. Mauro Jr and Sr were awesome along with everyone else that I dealt with.< /text>

Ernesto and E3 fixed our son’s Dodge Challenger after an accident. He and his team found a few things we did not know about and they were quick, professional and extremely communicative. Price was fair and as quoted - even with finding a few other dings. I highly recommend E3 and wouldn’t go anywhere else!<//Review>

I was so impressed with how quickly and professionally they came to the rescue. I was referred to e3 and am glad I was.   They helped tow my car and then fix it all in a week!   Super fast and honest.   Overall great experience with a tough situation.< /Review>

Thank you so much E3 for taking care of my car and ME!! I would definitely recommend these guys if you are unfortunately in an auto collision or need body repair. It is such a stressful process (insurance, police reports, etc), but E3 really kept me informed and made me feel like I was in good hands!< /Text>

My experience with E3 collision was impeccable! Ernie, Walter, and Emily were amazing. I took my car into E3 collision after being rear-ended. All I had to do was call for an insurance claim and the rest was done for me. E3 collision set me up in a rental car, dealt with insurance and fixed my car with no cost or hassle to me. I picked up my car with a zero balance and all I had to do was make one phone call to insurance. The work they did looks flawless. E3 collision went above and beyond! I highly recommend them for any work that needs to be done.</text>

Emily Sandoval, thank you but I doubt it very seriously that Richard Sparkman was sober observing those photos. I found a way more reasonable price and the door was at least 50% less than his quoted price. Richard was sparking, I see how he got his last name.</Text>

I had a great experience using this facility.  Super easy to deal with especially after having to deal with damage to my truck.  They were able to handle most everything for me with my insurance company, which i appreciate.  The work they performed was flawless.  I was expecting to have some noticeable spots where i would always be able to see where they repaired the damage.  I can honestly say, i dont know how they did it.  It looks just as new as the day i drove it off the showroom floor.  I find this facility to be very reputable, easy to deal with, professional, and to have put out some quality body shop repairs on my relatively new truck.  highly recommended !!!< /Text>

Thieving scumbags charging $6000 to store an unauthorized tow to your facility while putting a lien on the vehicle with threats to sell it if it isnt paid in cash! I hope you go out of business< /Review>

STAY AWAY...Rarely do I post negative reviews but this was the worst auto repair experience of my life. They took 4 whole months to complete a 2-3 week job and couldn’t get simple things right like the paint and type of clear bra. Ernie is a nice guy but they were all talk when it came to meeting times and delivering on the product. I couldn’t accept delivery twice bc of the shoddy job they did. My poor corvette sat outside for four months bc of this company’s horrible work.< /text>

I've been going to Shihlin at least twice a week ever since I discovered their popcorn chicken. They're seriously that good!

I was recently with a friend who's vegetarian and we tried their crispy mushroom as well. It was amazing. Go try out their snacks for yourself. Trust me, it'll make your day :)<//Text>

Best fried chicken I've had in the bay area! Crispy skin and marinated flavorful inside. Their spicy level is on the milder side so if you like it hot get the extra spicy.</Text>

We ordered from them today, and my Taiwanese parents were very happy! The popcorn chicken was fantastic, crispy and juicy. The oyster omelet was one of the better ones we have had in the US. The bubble tea was also great. Will definitely be back!</text>

The XXL chicken is so tasty! We also ordered the jayi chicken plate and popcorn chicken. They even gave us a free hot grass jelly bowl that had boba, taro and red beans. Our order was ready really quickly and tasted very fresh.<//review>

Shihlin Taiwan Street Snacks is a chain with three locations in the Bay Area and the multiple locations are a clear sign that there's a demand in the Bay Area for street eats: affordable, authentic, local cuisine that is quick and tasty to eat.

Having visited Taiwan to try the night markets (of which the one in Shihlin is one of the most famous), I had high hopes stopping by here for a quick snack.  The menu is on point with the XXL Chicken and the popcorn chicken being the most representative.  Other options include oyster noodles, braised chicken rice and plum fries.  Prices (for the Bay Area) are reasonable at under $10.  Our orders:

Grapefruit Tea - $3.79.  refreshing and not too sweet.  Pairs well with the fried food

XXL Chicken - $8.95.  Available either as white meat or thigh and breast, the portion size is generous and the texture crispy and juicy. The seasoning is good and has a slight kick at the end.

Brown Sugar Fresh Boba Tea - $4.79.  Brown sugar is the latest rage and the version here is decent.  The fresh boba could have been better but the flavor of the brown sugar is good without being  too sweet.

Overall, quite happy to have a Shihlin Taiwan snacks in the area.  It seems to be our go to quick spot in the area and the service is quick and friendly.  We could use a location in the South Bay.

Shihlin accepts credit cards including American Express.< /Text>

This is a very good rendition of the Night Market snacks that I miss from my time in Taiwan. It is a small shop, but that also lends itself to the "Taiwan feel". Many people order and take their food to go.
I enjoy dining here and I hope they are very successful in this location!!< /Text>

<text>Oyster omelette stole the show for me.

Popcorn chicken > ji pai

Mee sua was very bonito forward but deeply satisfying

Dont expect to be transported to a night market but expect the itch to be scratch and you'll walk away satisfied< /text>< Pics>

<text>The snacks here? Fire! Was looking for a quick snack in the SM DT area, and there’s always new one popping up. The work hubs and I ventured out to the area for a pick-me-up half day, and ended up at Shihlin. I love taiwan street foods. And man, what an awesome concept.

They’ve got the Taiwanese milk teas, the delicious quick snacks. All of it. So so good. I tried the oyster noodles, salt and pepper mushrooms, and jasmine milk green tea. I was honestly obsessed w the mushrooms, of all things! Bizarre, right?

But how could you go wrong a mushrooms! Mm mm. Anywho, snacks were somewhat reasonably priced. Been here on a few occasions now, and will likely continue to stop by. The foods yummy. The safe could look at little less bored/more engaged, but it is what it is. 4 stars</text></record>

SHILIN is always great for their fried chicken. The fried sweet potatoes are also pretty tasty. The drinks are noty favorite but the other foods are authentic Taiwanese According to some people who grew up in Taiwan.< /Review>

Authentic Taiwanese street snacks. A bit on the pricey side. Definitely recommend the fried mushrooms with spice. It looks plain but packs a punch.</Review>

I used to only stop for gas at shells and no longer will nor will my daughter's who own their own vehicles because they won't serve law enforcement.  I hope if your robbed or a crime happens you figure it out yourself and do not call law enforcement. Pretty sad a big corporation funds terrorists and makes this country less safe! Way to go Shell Corporation. We will take our business elsewhere. SMDH</Review>

The cashier came outside to the pump and saw my undercover lights and shut pump off on me. "We don't serve Law Enforcement, that's why I turned the pump off." I really wanted to say "if somebody does an armed robbery, don't call us, we won't help you." But I held it back.<//review>

<review>I went to visit El Salvador Embassy's. New embassy people are REALLY paying attention to your requests and helping you understand the system. I appreciated clear instructions, ample waiting rooms, kids and adults library, professional customer service.
The only disaventage is the parking lot. I'm not claustrophobic but it was hard not feeling like one.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< review>
This park is huge!The park has lost of open room and things to see throught out. Be warned the parking garage is a total ripoff!! I ended up spending $33 for parking.In the morning hours independent artists setup their work and try to sell it publicly. Some were out there making new art on the spot. People were doing yoga in the main park. I'm not sure if there is live music everyday but when I was in the main area an orchestra was playing.<//review>

< Review>
Labor Day weekend in Coral Gambles and decided to walk around the city to check out the non-star sites. Beautiful sized park with many activities going on. You saw the young 50+ and children with parents and pets strolling all over. Nice place to sit down with a book on a good day.</Review>

<review>A nice community soccer field, fenced in toddler playground, and basketball court. It's a little tucked away into a suburb area. Seems to be a nice neighborhood. Not sure what it's like at night here :0/</review>< Time>

<Review>It's not that the park itself is bad, it's just in a really bad area. There are lots of homeless walking around yelling mindlessly, as it's right off Hollywood Blvd. It feels like a bad area, somewhere I wouldn't let my kids go alone.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf233b18f45d:0xcf1751337f8ae616< /Gmap_id>< time>

Just had my vehicle thermostat replaced and engine diagnostic at this shop. I was impressed with the patience and helpfulness of the staff. It's obvious they care about people more than money. Highly recommended!<//Review>

<text>If you love supporting small businesses, Mario’s Auto Repair is one of the best places for general auto repair in Gardena. They are family-owned and operated for many years and they know how to do it right. Honest and fair-priced, there’s real value for you to come here for your car’s needs. I drive a 2007 Ram 1500 so you know I’ve had repairs done and Mario’s Auto Repair has always treated me fairly and honestly, making recommendations but never being pushy about it. I’ve had A/C work, transmission service, tune-ups, oil changes, shocks, brakes, and alignment and never once felt I didn’t get quality work for a great price. Calling around for prices will convince you, too! I have recommended them to friends before and they agree, so now I’m recommending you check them out, too, you won’t be disappointed!< /text><Name>Michael Keating<//Name>< pictures>

This shop is the best.... I’ve always worked on my own cars but this time i needed help from the pros.. I needed a timing chain replaced and other items as well. I was not wanting to do this at first cause it is a pricey repair. However they were the best priced and gave me a warranty on parts and labor, I’m glad I did it with this shop they are very friendly and honest. I can’t stress how important it is to have a honest mechanic by your side.. they are the best at what they do and their work speaks for itself. I will gladly come back and refer friends and family.. Oh it’s also a family owned shop which is a huge plus. Thanks Mario’s for everything you guys are the best.</text>

I had a very good first experience coming to this shop for a starter replacement/repair. I was recommended to them by a friend, and have no regrets using their service. Nestor helped me with my car ,and knew right away what the issue was. I am a young Lady who knew little to nothing about cars and was comfortable with them, and did not feel taken advantage of. Overall , great family business with kind people.<//Text>

<time>1563484795704</time><review>I visited Marios about a month ago. I was nervous because my car needed some work before moving across the country. The service was outstanding. From the minute I walked in they treated me like family, were very friendly and put my mind at ease. I wasn't sure what all needed to be done, they checked over everything and told me what needed work and what I could wait on.  They showed me every single part they put in, they gave me options on which brand of tire and explained the differences of each one and which they recommended. I have never worked with such honest mechanics, they did excellent work on my car and barely charged me anything for labor. It's hard to find a good mechanic, and I was really glad I found this one. I would highly reccomend this business!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< rate>

Great place to take your car, took my Honda Accord which was in bad shape that I didn't know, Jr the owner knew exactly what the problem was and he jumped right on it. He was Honest about what was going on with my car, this business is a honest place and will not steer you wrong,  prices are good and service is excellent. I would recommend this business to anyone. Thank you for your honest work and getting my car back at a reasonable time I will bw taking all my cars here. Don't just take your car to any mechanic who will just tell you anything to get your money and still don't do your car right. Take it to Mario Auto Repair< /Review>

Awesome customer service.!!!!!

They earned my business today by saving me from a car accident. They allow me to see their work and explain exactly what my car needs and how dangerously, bad condition my car was. My back and front brakes were practically gone. As a businessman myself , I can truely say they are Honest mechanics and they are proud of their work.

I will definitely promote them by bringing them business from people I know.
@mario's >Thank you so much for taking care of me and my car.  Great Job today.!!

I personally give them ********** 10 stars.< /Review>

I required repairs to my vehicle's emergency brake system and rear brakes and everyone at Mario's was very helpful and professional.  The final cost was on par with what I expected and fair.  They went above and beyond by helping me drive my car to a drop-off site from their shop when I couldn't be there in person.< /review>

Absolutely without a doubt the best mechanic shop ive ever been to. The mechanic was very curteous and they wasted no time in finding out what was wrong with our vehicle. We were amazed at the cleanliness, proffessionalism and effectiveness of this business. Our vehicle was fixed and ready to go within minutes and that was very much appreciated, we needed this, this is now our official mechanic shop and we highly recommend it. Thanks guys keep up the good work 👍< /Review>

<Text>I don’t usually leave comments when I rate, but these guys deserve it. My truck failed a safety inspection from the LA VPC and I was turned away. I had to get my E-Brake adjusted. I called Mario’s Auto and explained to them my situation and that I was scheduled to fly out of the country the next morning. They told me to swing by and so I did. When I got there, they were very friendly and very helpful. They understood exactly what I was going through. They told me they had a big job coming out of that VPC once before. They were able to get that particular car up to code for VPC to deliver it. The coolest part about that story is, the owner was in Hawaii. That customer contacted them via phone and they made it happen. Just like how they made it happen for me. These guys will help their customers as much as they can. Family owned and family operated. When I got to the shop, they stopped what they were doing and they fixed my truck. I would’ve paid more and waited longer at another shop. I totally recommend this shop!</Text></record>

These guys are great. I had a leaking radiator hose and it was over 100 degrees. I'm new to the area and didnt know where to go. I had a bad experience at a place down the street and didnt want to get robbed again so I Googled the nearest auto repair shop. The reviews were great at Mario's so I decided to give them a shot.The guys at Mario's auto were fast, friendly and gave me a great price to replace the hose. They are trully family operated and they treated me like a valued customer. I highly recommend these guys for all your auto repair needs. You have gained a loyal customer. Thank you to all the staff at Mario's, this world needs more businesses like yours.</text>

El día de ayer estaba tratando de encontrar un lugar para resolver un problema que tenía mi van ya que se le había encendido la luz del engine y aunque ya me habían dicho anteriormente que el código correspondía al catalítico y yo quería resolver el problema pronto así que precisamente encontré a Mario's Auto Repair y realmente  salí muy satisfecho  ya que desde un principio se comportaron muy amables y honestos el señor Mario Jr . muy profesional me resolvió el problema no tuve que esperar mucho y nunca había encontrado un lugar como este  excelente Servicio,  sus precios son muy justos y tratan que el cliente quede 100% satisfecho es por eso que este día regrese de nuevo y lleve mi otro vehículo para que le cambiaran los frenos y de igual manera  fue un servicio extraordinario  recomiendo a este taller en el pasado eh tenido muy malas experiencias  pero creo que a partir de hoy mis problemas y dolores de cabeza  con mecánicos han quedado en el pasado , espero seguir trayendo mis vehículos a Mario's y lo recomendaré con cualquiera que necesiten un lugar donde si les importe los clientes muchas  gracias que Dios los Bendiga  y les doy 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</Review>< pictures>

< review>
Small kiosk starbucks in the center of the Faahion Fair Mall.  They have a tiny selection of prepackaged coffee, mugs & other retail items.  Very limited seating.  Dont expect to find a seat.  Unfortunately other Mall shoppers take advantage of the Starbucks seating leaving Starbucks customers no where to sit. Within the last year with the change in management this Starbucks has gone from a 5 star rating to a 2 star. There has been a complete shift in the quality of customer service, cleanliness, quickness, quality of drinks, and the overall experience ever since management has changed. Me and my colleagues have been frequenting this location for The Last 5 Years that used to be our favorite spot. The staff was friendly personable warm and always greeted us with a friendly attitude. They took good care of the regulars and appreciated loyalty. The new group of Staff seems bitter annoyed and unhappy to be there and that reflects in the quality of their drinks the speed in which the drinks are prepared and the overall experience. It's understandable that this location is busy being in the middle of the mall, however, thats not a good reason to skimp on service.   A couple of really good staff members still work behind the counter however unfortunately they are overshadowed by the negative ones. Don't bother coming in on a busy weekend you should expect to wait 20 to 25 minutes for your drink.<//review>

The employees that work here have to put up with a lot and almost nobody thanks them for what they do on a daily basis. Yeah, maybe a few of them have an attitude but most people would after dealing with customers who don't know how to order, who try to cheat the system, or who are just plain rude. Maybe before throwing them all under the bus you can take a look and realize how busy it gets at the mall; could you keep an extremely positive attitude while bending over backwards for literally thousands of customers a day? I don't think so.</Review>

Never open on time and not fast, friendly, or reliable. If it says you open at 7:30 it shouldn’t be 8:15/8:30 when you finally open. Ridiculous and some of us have to be at work in the mall< /review>

< Review>
They nearly always get my coffee perfect.  And on the extremely rare occasion when it's not quite right they always fix it for me with enthusiasm.  Great good natured baristas.   they always recognize me and when they see me coming they are already started on my cup 🤓    (Sorry for the times I throw y'all a curve ball and switch it up).   But even then they just laugh along with me.    Love y'all.   And I'm grateful for the way y'all make me feel welcome all the time.
Muchas gracias,
Not Connie❣️❣️❣️</Review>

The cashier was rude and unfriendly. According to the conversation we had during my order, it seems she was the manager. The fellow baristas were unfriendly, and lacked positive customer interaction. No visible date dots, straw container empty, and dirty surroundings. Very unpleasant experience. No intentions of going back.<//text>

<Text>Gorgeous park just a few miles off highway. Came to the right time when wildflowers blooming. Many trails from mild to steep to choose from. Perfect place to picnic.< /Text>< pics>

Beware of ticks on your dogs. Found a tick on my dog’s face even though he was leashed. The tick must have got on him when he was sniffing a bush on the side of the trail. This park has barely any shade. It’s mostly exposed. Currently, the hills are green for now. It can get really hot in the spring and probably summer. There are some steep hills for hiking and a few nice views of the bay.< /Text>

< Review>
There are a lot of trails you can enjoy. Great place for hiking, running, mountain biking and horseback riding. Some parts of the trails are steep, like the first half of Joice trail starting at Benal ranch, again Joice trail coming up from the east to Vista loop trail, Boundary trail near the Coyote Peak and the first half of Mine trail at Nored ranch . If you want thrill of MTB'ing, try the rocky ridge trail. Most of the trails have no shade, so you need sunscreen and lots of water. Sometimes you can see snakes, wild turkeys, dears along the trail. A couple of months ago, I spotted a group of wild boars.</Review>

<text>An unexpected surprise here. An Archery range with parking and great targets set up. The people who share this location are safe and respectful.  Was interesting to see a whole flock of wild turkeys that wander through in the afternoon before sunset. Just be sure to hold up when they pass by, no walking dinner from here!!!< /text>< pictures>

Good trails and very nice views of San Jose. Sometimes there is a lot of foot traffic, and other times is quite lonely. You’ll see coyotes, bobcats, deers, and wild turkeys. Some trails are a bit steep, but are easy or moderate.< /Review>

I kinda am fed up with the fires and the overcast weather. Humidity and ashes . It's like god has ashed  on us. I remember when you used to be able to drive threw this road and end up in almaden  valley . Definitely  a great cruise  to remember.  IBM influenced  technology And the history  of Bernal Family . A woman named Velma was what Bernal road was named after. Bet she never envisioned  computers and freeways in her family's path either did the cottles or ohlone natives. If your from here you should  remember that vehicle. It was hit by a drunk driver in an intersection  in Campbell.  Only for this young man to jump out and rescue the driver. But totalling this 1964 SS  Impala. Him and his family friends and associates from there have keen  respect for this area. And have a pride and love and appreciation  for  the neighbors of this area.  It would be nice to actually feel some understanding threw out and hear people's educated  opinions and or attitudes.  I'm good with that. ☆<//text></record></dataset><record>

Wow. Fantastic hike... probably a level 2-3. Lots of rocks during the first half so no running. The second half is runnable. The views of south san jose are breathtaking.</Review>

Sherwood Forest, the Santa Clara County public archery range in South San Jose is perfect for beginners, veteran archery enthusiasts, and everyone in-between. Every time I go It's clean and the people there are friendly. I love it there.<//Text>

I thought course was okay. They have two courses, 18 hole and 9 hole course. For practice there's a driving range, putting area, and chipping area. Golf carts are well kept there.< /Text>

This is a great safe place to go hiking. If you have a dog you are able to bring them as long as they are on a leash. Luckily every Trail is easy to find and even easier to find your way back. The bathrooms are super clean and they are always stocked with paper towels, toilet paper, and hand soap. Last time I went the meter to charge for parking was down but keep in mind that you should have cash on you just in case the ticket meter is working again. Last time I checked used to be $6.<//Text>

< Review>
Well this time I was in the Southern part of the park, and it is not nearly as pleasant as the Northern part that you enter and pay a parking fee. Unfortunately, a lot of people come here to drink and smoke marijuana in their cars and they discard bottles on the ground. Be careful because there is a lot of broken glass and trash here. The Northern entrance is much, much better and has easy access to trails and has benches and nice trees to sit under. Go to the Northern entrance, yeah.</Review>

Great day for hike.  Took the Coyote Peak & Rocky Ridge trail loop 3.8 miles.  Great views of the Valley.  Weather worked out, lots of sun but a good breeze for the majority of the trail.  Good experience 👍.<//review>

A nice hike, not too long. There is not much shade towards the top of the peak, so be advised if you are hiking in the middle of the day. A great view of San Jose and beyond with a few benches at the top and a plank with some information.< /Review>

Beautiful, clean, well maintained. It's well worth the price to park. I hiked up to coyote peak, the trails are well marked and comfortable. Good views if the weather is clear.<//Review>

It is a fine hiking park. You can easily make a 10 mile loop here. There is a great view of the Santa Clara Valley below.</Text>

Santa Teresa County Park is great to visit. There's many parking lots and a ton of great views and trails. Not the most shade throughout some of the trails but proper sunscreen can help with that. Definitely recommend coming for an afternoon.<//Text>

Perfect hiking trails tucked away in South San Jose. Park is never packed and just gorgeous in spring time with great views of the South bay.< /Review>

The mountain biking in the park is very good.  Listed as intermediate to hard, it kicked my butt today on the Best of Santa Teresa 13+ mile route.

I had to walk many of the steeper rock gardens on the way up.  A total of over 2000 feet in elevation gain put a hurting on me!<//text>< response>

This is a great place to go on a mild hike. Lots of ups and downs. The only major downside is the paths are super narrow and there are mountain bikers. They are all pretty careful though.< /Review>

This park is my neighborhood park, it's great for being so close to everything. Amazing mountain biking trails and there is even some scattered rock climbing over near the gold coarse. Nice place to picnic and allot of professional photographers take family pictures near the difference old farm equipment and barn as well as some of the medows when it's green.<//Review>

<review>Consistently see several groups of deer walking about freely and unbothered. The park is not busy and often feels like no one else is there. Very clean and well maintained. Bit of a steep climb to get to if biking to it. The trails inside the park are optimum for mountain biking (not for road bikes).
Restroom is also very well maintained.

San Jose seriously needs to revisit their drone restrictions. This park is vast and would see more use if it were a drone friendly park.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808e2fc181066781:0xc7069f6213d5dbba< /gmap_id></record>

Great park for everything. Riding bikes, walk or run. Long trails with great views. Wild life is all around. Stay alert pay attention and you will see more. Bobcats, Mountain Lions, Coyotes, Snakes, Birds, Deers and Boars are some of the highlights.<//Text>

Wow, the views are fantastic from Coyote.  The mountain biking in the park is very good.  Listed as intermediate to hard, it kicked my butt today on the Best of Santa Teresa 13+ mile route.

I had to walk many of the steeper rock gardens on the way up.  A total of over 2000 feet in elevation gain put a hurting on me!< /text>

Today Bob and I did maintenance on both mowers, now we're ready to tackle the grass & weeds. The archery range is looking great, with all the improved target butts. Thanks mainly to a hand full of dedicated members, doing most of the upkeep & maintenance. Best range in the area!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

There are many trails, some much much tougher than others. I recently ran the trail that leads to the radio tower at the top it was an awesome cardio workout. For the most part everyone extends  courteousy to one another.</Text>

Absolutely amazing county park in the heart of Silicon Valley with a diverse network of trails overseeing the valley and adjoining Santa Teresa Golf Course. This park is incredibly accessible for most San Jose residents via Bernal Road and is a great way to get back to nature and escape the everyday hustle and bustle of city life. The trail up to Coyote Peak is quite challenging but offers those who make it to the top a majestic view all the way to San Francisco on a clear day. One of my favorite Bay Area parks by far.</text>

It would take me about 1.5 hours to do my usual hike. You will find small deer, turkeys, boars, quale, rattle snakes, etc.
At the entrance they have a spot with a map and information about the type of wild animals you can encounter. They have pamphlets that come with a map and information you can take.
They also provide hiking sticks it's a first come first serve.
I would totally recommend it!</Text>< Pics>

Bring sunscreen. Overcast today? Bring sunscreen anyway. Zero shade. Solid mountain biking spot in an area that otherwise doesn't have many rocks to speak of. Not the best place for beginners.< /review>

Great place with many hiking trails. I usually start my hike at camden ave/harry road near ibm to make my hike longer. Limited parking on fortini where bikers/hikers usually begin. Any park is a good park to hike; we're lucky to have so many places!! Happy trails!!</text>

Glad this is here, but this isn’t my favorite place to bike or hike because it’s sooo rocky. It is amazing that IBM donated the land to
The county! And this is a pretty great example of philanthropy< /Text>

Stunningly beautiful and a great place to get away from the hustle of SV.  Dogs are welcome on leash. However, expect your animal and possibly you to bring home several ticks and fleas. There are also quite a number of foxtails growing along side the trails.< /Text>

This park is a nice place to go hiking and mountain biking. Sometimes you will see deer, turkey, or quail around this area. There many also be snakes on the trail. Be careful as they may attack you if you get too close. I try to leave a good distance when walking past them. They will simply slither away if you do so. In the spring, there is a variety of different wildflowers. Sometimes the flowers will be in big patches. Sometimes there will be nice sunsets in the park also.</text>

<review>Went to the Black Mountain Bowmen range. Great range and it's all maintained by volunteers! The other archers are very courteous and obey normal range rules (no arrows whizzing by my head when I go pull). Nice and quiet, and I've seen tons of wildlife too!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>A beautiful park with great views all around. very nice and peaceful. Well maintained. Watch out not to step on a tarantula, they are often found on the trails and fire roads here and do no harm, so just let them be. This is a rattle snake territory so watch your dog carefully and jog with caution, they will be quiet and will not attack if you just pass them by and pose no threat.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Lots of great trails with a range of difficulty. Depending on the season one can expect to see a waterfall, streams or desert like conditions. There are some great views and the park merges with Bernal Ranch Park. There are some good mountain bike trails too. The Rocky Ridge Trail looks like a moonscape, can be tough by foot or bike but a cool experience. Lots of wild life in the park, deer, coyotes, turkeys, wild boar and mountain lions too.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate><name>Russ<//name><UserId.>107768627985002231706</UserId.>< Date>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Santa Teresa is my favorite park in San Jose. The park occupies a sizable area and has a fair amount of trails for hikers, bikers, and horse riders. The highest point in the park (Coyote Peak) offers a nice view of San Jose (but be prepared for the steep climb, especially if you're biking there.)

Santa Teresa is usually not very crowded, even on weekends. Weekdays are especially nice for those who enjoy activities like animal and bird watching, or a lone bike ride.

Unlike many other parks, leashed dogs *are* allowed here (but please, make sure your dog is on a leash!).The park also offers (clean) public restrooms and a large covered area which can be reserved for parties.

For mountain bikers, the park offers a wide range of biking trails, ranging from almost flat and easy to rocky and technical. No matter how experienced you are, you can always create a route that will get you entertained (and tired).

The only thing I miss in this park is a large body of water. There are a few seasonal streams running through the park, but no lakes.

The parking lot is fairly large, and parking was $6 last time I checked. Rangers do check the place and will give you tickets if you don't pay the parking fees or park your car on the road.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Great trail for winter time hikes (as long as it is dry). Good for families, dog walking, mountain bikers (a bit technical, though). Maybe not optimal for summer time hikes, because there is practically no shade along the trail.</text>

Excellent place for hiking and mountain biking. On hot weather go early as there's no much shade and it gets very hot. Many parking places around the park by trail heads, some of them there is a small fee<//Text>

<text>Peaceful, green (in Feb) area with wide, well maintained trails. Mostly steep inclines and some open meadow areas with windy paths. Many deer are present, along with cows and many types of birds. Very hot and exposed in summer.< /text>< Pics>

Good place for easy-mild hiking.  Most of the hiking is open air on hills (not tree covered or shady areas... be prepared with sun screen).  Was a bit muddy when we were there in end of December.  The view from top of coyote peak is very nice (if you ignore the radio tower up there).</Review>

Great trails. Can't get lost! Can hike hours or minutes. Hubby and I used to go every morning before work for 30 minutes as well as hike various trails in the weekend with our children and dog.< /Review>

Nice park well maintained. When you arrive there is a parking permit requirement. $6.00 daily. If you are throwing a big party. There is a spot for reservations. It has benches and a huge grill. The locations are spread out and the other spots are first come first serve basis.< /Text>

<Review>This is one of my favorite parks.  We hike, walk our dog, and mountain bike here regularly.  It's a great place for exercise, and you can easily get 2000 feet of mountain bike climbing in 8 miles of riding, with hills left over in case you have anything left over!  After rains the trails are muddy with soft clay and unsuitable for mountain biking (and sometimes a pain for hiking), and I wish they posted trail closures online.  The views are fantastic.<//Review>< Name>

<rate>2</rate><text>The park is very poorly marked as being closed when it is. Retracing my steps to where I came in at the free parking lot, there was only one sign that would have notified of the closure that had been grafittied over heavily.

Maybe post trail closures at the base entrance instead of having militant rangers threaten citations? Seems like a pretty simple solution.
I can't be a law abiding citizen if it's not clear to me that I am not being so.

Beautiful park, Rocky Ridge is great.</text>< Pics>

Fun park for those who are looking for a quick hike, run, or mountain bike ride. With all the trails combined, it adds up to 13 miles of climbing, descents, and views of San Jose. Awesome for relaxed hiking and some XC biking.<//review>

I love this park. There is a $6 entrance fee. There are quite a few picnic sites and trails for hiking. If you are lucky you might meet a coyote (I did twice so far). Beautiful views from the tops.<//Review>

Santa Teresa County Park is a nice hiking and mountain biking destination. However, all the trails are completely open to the elements, be they rain, or shine, so one must be well prepared when coming out here.</Text>

Beautiful park in the middle of the county. Equestrian trails, amazing mountain biking trails, picnic areas, an assortment of wildlife, and wildflowers in the spring. Opens 8am. Closes sunset. $6 to park in the main area.<//text>

One of my favorite parks. Has a bit of everything you might want: Good hiking trails, friendly to horses (I don't ride a horse), friendly to pets (many parks won't allow them), very nice for mountain biking (has trails ranging from very easy to difficult) and is not so far.</review>

<text>This county park was an amazing place to drive through and watch leaves fall during Autumn. I once watched a tree fall around here, but i didn't hear it make any sound, probably because my windows were up. So i imagined it making a noise close to something like -crackssshhhh-crashhhh-aaaahhhh-oooowwwwww~!!!!!!!<//text>< Date>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Come to Santa Teresa County Park, located ten miles south of downtown San Jose in the Santa Teresa Mountains. This 1,673-acre park has a rich history and spectacular views from the trails above the Almaden and Santa Clara valleys. The secluded highland valley of the park provides a quiet episode for exploring the natural surroundings of the surrounding developed areas. Santa Teresa County Park is located at the southern end of Santa Teresa. The park can be accessed from the Alma Mountain Valley or Santa Clara Valley. From the Santa Clara Valley, take the US 101 or 85 motorway to the Bernal Road exit. Drive 1.3 miles west along Bernal Road and cross Santa Teresa Avenue to Santa Teresa. Bernal Road continues through the park's Santa Teresa Golf Club and enters the hills. Located on Bernal Road, Pueblo Day Use Area is set in a small open valley on a hill.

來到聖特雷莎縣公園，該公園位於聖何塞市中心以南十英里的聖特雷莎山。 這個佔地1,673英畝的公園擁有豐富的歷史，從Almaden和Santa Clara山谷上方的小徑可以欣賞到壯觀的景色。 公園幽靜的高地山谷為探索周圍發達地區的自然環境提供了一個安靜的插曲。聖特雷莎縣公園位於聖特雷莎山的南端。 公園可從阿爾馬登山谷或聖克拉拉谷進入。 從聖克拉拉谷（Santa Clara Valley）出發，沿US 101或85號高速公路前往Bernal路出口。 沿伯納爾路向西行駛1.3英里，穿過聖特雷莎大道前往聖特雷莎山。 伯納爾路繼續穿過公園的聖特雷莎高爾夫俱樂部，蜿蜒進入山丘。 Pueblo Day Use Area酒店位於Bernal Road路旁，坐落在山丘上的一個小型開放式山谷中。<//Text>< pics>
