<Rate>1<//Rate><text>My one and only experience with Dr. Manoocher Khatami was extremely disappointing.  I have no need or time for one who has an angry, at times hostile, affect toward any patient.  He felt necessary to tell me minimum two times he has practiced 40 years (profile says 50), and professor at UCSD in response to something I said.   No need for this comment unless one feels threatened.  What he lacks is understanding and compassion which are absolutely necessary for a competent psychiatrist.  Would never recommend!<//text>< pictures>

My therapist is so lovely and my experience with LifeStance has been nothing but wonderful. Even the staff members outside my therapist have been so gentle and patient with me. Honestly I wish I started to therapy sooner!</Review>

<review>I have seen Charissa Ruud for about two weeks now, I am very new to therapy. Though I have only seen her twice she has truly helped change my perspective on my traumas and has provided me tools to successfully move past these issues. She is truly caring and does not just brush you off. She really listens and wants to help. I’m so thankful to have her apart of my self help journey. I’m excited for future appointments. I didn’t think I would like telehealth appointments but it has been so convenient and easy. Thank you! Oh ps, if you’re a cat person she will be perfect for you!!! The cutest lil cats make appearances (I swear at the best time) I have a feeling they are just as passionate about making people smile as she is!</review><Resp>{'time': 1618326288294, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your five-star review!'}<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

I feel very positive about the therapist. However  the intake process was s bit disjointed. Seemed like overkill and slowed things down. I look forward to seeing Dr. Anderson in the future.</Text>

<time>1612286859411</time><rating>1< /rating><Review>The website does jut work.  Voicemail says to go to patient portal for scheduling.  It’s very difficult to get a physical person on the phone for scheduling.  The patient portal for 9 months that I’ve used it has worked 3 times ever.  Does matter what browser I use, or device.  It just spins and spins.  It’s very difficult to schedule appointments.  I’ve pretty much stopped going to therapy because it’s too much of a pain to use the scheduling system and the phone system tells your to go to the website.  When you call to schedule the staff becomes frustrated saying I should go to the website.  The audio prompts on the phone also lead to the website.  You basically have to decide a bunch of strange messages to Blackfoot your way on to the schedule.  Personally of it was me I would fire your web developer.  The site does not work.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

pandemic. I started seeing my therapist a few months before the pandemic hit and was already gaining great insight into myself and my issues when we went into lockdown. Fortunately telehealth sessions became available immediately. I find them every bit as effective as in-person meetings and am happy to continue seeing my therapist remotely.

Having access to a skilled, perceptive therapist during these stressful times has made all the difference to my well-being. I highly recommend PsyCare's services and have already recommended them to friends.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1609437463223, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your five star review!'}</response>< gmap_id>

<review>Psycare, Kearny Mesa location. The receptionist, Angela, is truly horrible. She deletes messages and ignores patients. She cuts you off and just transfers you and gives out the wrong information. This is the second time I have had a bad experience with her. They even ignore when the pharmacy calls to refill basic meds. Incompetent and rude. Apparently not even the doctors care about their patients. My doctor just discharged me after years, because I cannot keep scheduling an appointment every three months, it’s too expensive and we have only met every 6 months in the past. Apparently no one at psycare or whatever the new name is (lifestance) —you can change the name but it’s still just sad that all they care about is your money.

I’m making a complaint to the DMHC after reading all these other complaints, this just isn’t right. I encourage you all to do the same.</review>< pics>

<Text>Update 2: Still cannot schedule any appointments without having to call the front desk staff were are abusive to clients. Spoke with a rep who was supposed to be having their IT department check and fix the problem but she has been unresponsive to emails for a few weeks. My next call is another complaint to the BBB.

Update: Psycare changed their name but NOT their abusive tactics towards clients. Despite having a good relationship with my therapist I’ll be seeking services elsewhere.

I have had the worst customer service with this company. Wendy in Billing screams and uses textbook gaslighting (odd for a company that specializes in mental health). Jin screams at clients when trying to solve issues about their appointments being rescheduled last minute. The ONLY reason I continue to use their services is because the therapists are dedicated, knowledgeable, and helpful. If only they could get their front office staff to stop abusing their clients.</Text>< username>

< review>
I have had several experiences with Psycare  helping both myself and my daughter. Her psychiatrist Dr Chang was amazing. She has now moved to Kaiser.

My therapist Mel Lipsey is easy to talk to. I like to come in with things to focus on. His insight has been very helpful. He has given me a lot of outside resources to look at.

The parking situation is less than ideal. Allow time for that. It often takes some time to reach someone on the phone.
The front desk staff are friendly and helpful for the most part.<//review>

I had never sought mental health consulting until going to PsyCare. I rarely see my psychiarist and then only briefly. He has had little input on my problem. However. I have nothing but high praise for Dr. B. He is thoughtful, nurturing, and insightful. Because of him  I have developed new techniques for coping with my problems. My only regret is that the practioner/patient relationship does not allow friendship.</Review>

<review>My child has been a patient at Psycare Kearny Mesa for almost 11 years. She has been seeing Dr. Ramineni and we have been beyond pleased with the care she provides. Dr. Ramineni listens to myself and my daughter. She is not one to just prescribe meds and force you out. She listens to you, makes sure current meds are working (if they aren’t she will explain in detail what alternatives are available) and asks if you have any questions. As for the staff when checking in.. In all of the years we’ve been going to Psycare there’s only been one instance where I was unsatisfied and management took care of it immediately. The ladies are always welcoming, kind and helpful.<//review><gmap_id>0x80dbffc0a5e92747:0xdf45c884fb58d803</gmap_id><Date>1568099906993</Date></record></dataset><record>

I feel like my psychiatrist is ready for me to find soon as I walk in. The staff acts like you're bothering them and aren't very welcoming. Do you all not know where you work?

Horrible staff. Unfriendly .. the receptionist received my intake and then put me on hold and another person picked up the phone and told me we can’t take you as a patient .. I am a retired physician and have never experienced something like that as a patient myself . Doctors in this group should know how unprofessional their employee are. In addition the practicing doctors should know that they are turning the patients away.. Very bad taste for a psychiatrist office who are supposed to be passionate and willing to help and treat patients professionally.</review>

<Text>Because I a forced to give at least one star, I will make sure that anyone reading this knows that the ONLY star they have earned in my care has been a decent base-level of service, as long as nothing challenging occurs.

Recently, I worked with Dr. Garcia to up my dose of a med. He assured me that, because it was a new dose level, the fill of the new prescription should work right away. However, since there is no single pill at the new level, therefore requiring me to cut and combine pills of the current level, the insurance had problems filling the new scrip. When I called for help figuring this out, I got an annoyed call from Dr. Garcia to tell me that I will have to sort it out with my insurance company. No help offered, although I'd put money on this not being the first time he and his patients have run into the same or similar issues.

Two days ago, I put a request in via my CVS app to have that prescription refilled, only to have it "rejected by physician". I am currently out of work and immobile due to surgery, and tried to explain that to the staffer who called to confirm the rejection ("because it has been soooo looong" - 6 months‽ for a med I've been on for 15 years‽ - since I have seen the doctor); I let her know that it wasn't my intention to go without seeing the doctor, but that right now I could not, and was there nothing I could do until I am up on my feet again? Nope. No help or advice was offered outside of "well, you can call in when you feel better." No tips for going cold turkey - something we are never supposed to do according to psychiatrists. Nothing.

I said "fine." I hung up. I then felt bad for not at least sticking up for myself, and called back. I got 3 phone company messages saying " we are sorry. This number has been disconnected or is no longer in service," and three attempts where it rang at least ten times before I hung up. Finally, I was connected to someone who, though extremely kind, patient and compassionate, could only offer to send my message onward. No doubt this person was employed by whatever answering service they use "after hours" (it was only 4:45‽).

If you are looking to get help with depression, anxiety, or any other psychiatric issues, and PsyCare is your only option, call after hours and talk to their call center. Unlike the staff at this psychiatric center, they will not leave someone who is anxious swinging in the breeze. If it isn't your only option, find somewhere that actually psyCares.<//Text>< user_id>

<text>I was a patient at Psycare from 2012 - 2014. During this time what stood out the most was how rude the office staff were. Each time I came for an appointment they avoided eye contact and when they did acknowledge my presence it was far from a friendly encounter. All I can say is, for someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety, this was a nightmare situation to be in at the time. The doctors were okay, but mostly seemed to be pill pushers. And to top it off, when I requested my records for an immigration case this past year they took over 4 months to send them out, severely delaying my hubby's green card. Avoid at all costs. :/</text>< pictures>

<Time>1527457344182</Time><review>Lovely park very close to downtown palo alto and palo alto transit center. Two large fields to throw the ball around, also a big playground and picnic tables in the shade. Its in a residential area and all the families seemed to be really comfortable with their kids running everywhere.</review>< pics>

This is a very nice little park. Lots of shade under trees but plenty of open grass area for games. There is a playground for kids. The park has a water fountain on Homer Avenue which is convenient. Great place for a nice picnic.<//Text>

Very open and lots of grass. Neat cordoned off kids play area. Bring a ball to kick around and a picnic basket and blanket for lunch on the lush grass. Small terrific historic museum across the street.</Review>

This is one of my favorite parks. It has a beautiful playground with swings, a sandbox, picnic tables, a young children playset, an older children playset, and a climbing rock. Outside the playground is a good-sized field where people bring dogs, play sports, and just generally relax.

It's just a few blocks from Whole Foods, so it's easy to pick up some fresh food and head on over to the park for a delicious, relaxing time.</text>

Perfect for toddlers and almost toddlers. There is a big grass area, a big tree, a train shaped jungle gym, a tall slide, a short slide, a rock wall, swings, a brass dolphin (yep) and affluence.</text>

very helpful on-site staff, very good deal, however, the phone number listed sometimes does not directly connect to the office, they ended up sending me a new number, which they should update here on google.</Review>

But the storage unit 10 x 15 isnt really 10 x 15. I thought it looked smaller than 10 x 15 so to satisfy mt curiosity i measured it with a 25 ft tape . well i was right . it came up short. So the thing i figured was when they say 10 x 15 they include the whole building brick and all. You know the measurement starts at the outside of each unit not actual storage space??? What a shame or sham?? Anybody else have that conclusion???< /Text>< username>

<userid>107890747902649804635<//userid><text>Antonio was amazing! I called the day before and he confirmed my online reservation and answered all of my questions. When I arrived he let me know where to park, he walked me over to my unit to ensure it’s the size that I wanted and even showed me how to use the lock. He informed me that the office was closed but that I can stay in my air conditioned car and he brought all the paperwork out to me. Great experience! Oh not to mention a great deal! I was looking for the best price between LA and the High Desert, and this was it by a long shot. I highly recommend Storage Direct in Fontana!</text>< date>

Their prices are way better than other storage spaces near the area. I had a bunch of questions and Antonio was able to answer them all. The storage unit was clean and the customer service was great.<//Review>

<text>Great pricing.  The front office people are really nice.  Informative and easy to talk too.  There prices don't jump constantly either.  My first rent I crease we $3 most other places I've been raised it $10 every 6 months.  I really like this place and the people who work there.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><Time>1521302246252</Time>< Response>

<Review>Royce the Manager, is a great guy.  He is easy to talk to and if I have a question, he calls me back within a few hours to answer my question.  He keeps the place clean and is helpful and friendly.  I would recommend this place to anyone and I give them 5 stars!!!<//Review><userid>105475818483889871047<//userid><date>1519343746891<//date><gmap_id>0x80c34c8ce21364b7:0xd0f16cd98bbe55a8<//gmap_id>< response>

Storage Direct is THE BEST PLACE to store things in Fontana over anywhere else. It is safe, clean, tidy, even though the dust in the units is OUR, the unit holder's, responsibility to keep clean and NOT that of Storage Direct unless one is vacating their unit, which they themselves as the unit holder are expected to keep clean when they vacate and it be as neat as when they moved in and rented the unit; it is not Storage Direct's responsibility to clean the unit for the unit holder, because our contract says WE are supposed to keep our units neat and clean. So I totally disagree with the reviewer who says the place is dirty and the worst place to store stuff: that is a lie. I LOVE Storage Direct, its staff, the location, the price, the insurance coverage, AND my unit, which I DO KEEP CLEAN regularly on a monthly basis. Thank you. You get an A++++++ in my books. Good work, keep up the good work. HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
Regards,
Teresa Garcia<//Text>

nice place to get your WIC, but you buy here food stamps and money, prices are high  on some items. costumer service is like, well the manager I think she is, her face is always so serious and mad. she is like go over there with the latinas, they can help you. And I'm like, Ok, because you don't or what?</Review>

I love the smell when you go in here, smells clean and fresh. I didn't like how one of their employees was very rude, and said I couldn't taste the grapes before I bought them, other than that great produce.< /text>

<username>pahoua xiong<//username><review>I been going to this store for many years. This is my first time I experienced of one of the worse night shop that happened to me. The counter girl her name is Rebecca. She treat her guests so uncomfortably due to her attitude and unhappy face look so uncomfortable with this clerk. She talk to her customers like she dont get a F** about her job or her customers. She doesn't greed my family or other customers at all until we have to ask her if she is read. She the only one in the first counter that night but other is at the back stuck up stuffs. Very disappointed when I ask her questions she replied back with attitude and no explanation to her customers. She doesn't say "I'm sorry, we can't do that or we can't do this." She didn't help us to bring the stuffs to my car with her attitude she ask other worker to help me bring the stuffs into my car. I hope to not to see this type of worker with attitude and no manners to her customers. :(<//review><GmapID>0x809ad7801dcd4943:0x4267d82567f910a0< /GmapID><user>109592142038989528765< /user></record></dataset><record>

I like being able to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Can also get milk and juice here too. People here try to make it a pleasant experience for you. You have to take a number and wait to be called. They will even help you out to your car with your groceries.</review>

To be honest, I've gone to a lot of different chiropractors for neck and back issues stemming from my posture and my inability to escape working in front of a computer. That being said, my biggest issue was that while adjustments worked in the short term, there weren't many chiropractors that helped me try to correct the underlying issues. On my first visit, Dr. Mike walked through a series of tests and explained the problems that he was seeing. He immediately identified multiple complications that took some of my past chiropractors several visits to uncover. In addition to working on adjusting my alignment, he spent about half an hour with me going through multiple strengthening exercises to target the muscle groups that were unbalanced. So far, my experience with The Lab has been awesome. I am looking forward to continuing my treatment and hopefully, I will see some big changes soon. Thanks Dr. Mike!</Text>

<text>I've been to many physical therapists and I have to say this is the best I've ever been to. Starting with the facility it's very clean and well kept. They have new equipment. The staff is amazing I really like Mike because he pays attention to detail. I personally hate it when people try to rush you out. There's usually a plan and they stick to it. Highly recommend this place<//text>< GmapID>

<review>Your best option in Los Angeles. Professional, friendly staff and knowledgeable doctors. I started with physiotherapy after knee surgery and was able to avoid surgery in my other knee due to the excellent treatment. Physiotherapy can be very boring and challenging but the staff of the LAB make it much easier. Highly recommended.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Long story short I fractured my left shoulder snowboarding back in January. After I got surgery I had to start physical therapy immediately, so I found The Lab and I don't think I couldn't have picked a better place.  The facility is clean and bright and the staff is professional and supportive.  I've been working with Dr. Mike for over 4 weeks and he is an incredible physical therapist.  He is patient, knowledgeable, and personable and with his help I know I'll get back to 100%</Review>

I’ve had two injuries. One was a spinal disc injury which required surgery, and my current torn meniscus in my knee. I went to another PT prior that wasn’t helping me heal or giving me proper exercise to speed my recovery. That is a whole different story at LAB. Great Drs of PT and really take the time to help your body move through the healing process. I have felt stronger and gained back movement each visit. Everyone really makes an effort to make sure you won’t RE-injure yourself during exercises and help swelling and your muscles relax. I will not go anywhere else for PT.< /Text>

HE BEST physical therapy place in all of LA and I have been to quite a few. Dr. Mike is amazing and has always been incredibly knowledgeable and helpful in helping me recover and get back to where I need to be for my physical activity. The hands-on work that the doctors do here surpasses all other places I've been to. Dr. Mike works skillfully with his hands like an elegant surgeon navigating his way through your muscular skeleton system with great precision. The building is always clean and the staff is always friendly. It's also a lot easier to take advice from the doctors when you know they practice healthy habits themselves. They live what they teach. An also added bonus that they are incredibly kind and funny as well. The environment is the cream of the crop. The best in the biz. First place gold medal. In all seriousness though, come here if you want your injuries fixed. Other places have just never lived up to here. Highly recommend.< /Review>

<user>114993987940473276683< /user><review>I’m not generally the type of person to write a review unless it warrants one and for LAB physical therapy, I definitely have to share my experience as they totally deserve a 5 star review across the board. I have never been so pleased with my experience as the doctors Mike and John are so caring and definitely have a wealth of knowledge/experience and truly want you to get better. They are so helpful and kind and take the time to not only work with you but to educate you as well. It was also satisfying because both are actual doctors DPT working on you and spend one on one time as opposed to throwing you off to an island. Emily the assistant is super awesome and works step by step with you during your exercises.

Overall, great staff, extremely clean/organized, and definitely the best physical therapists.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1602782364755<//date>< pics>

The best PT doctors ever. I’ve been to several places before coming to the LAB. Since 2017, I have very severe my neck disc/right side sciatica. Those symptoms caused by multiple injuries and factors in many years. From 2017, I went to 3 different physical therapy and I had to switched my docs several times to figure it out. (As you know, some docs are not really docs... due to my insurances, due to mistreatment from the previous docs, my symptoms are not really getting better.. it was more of getting worse)

I finally found a decent sports medicine doc in 2020. And I’ve found the LAB docs in Jan 2021.  Now I obviously know who’s good or who’s bad quite well. (For example, my previous PT places didn’t conduct manual therapy at all. A lot of physical aids only assisted me for 10 months so that I couldn’t get better much. Even the PT doc actually recommended me to go get an injection or consider a surgery haha....)

But, now, it’s been only 6 weeks since I started going to the LAB, my pain level is incredibly reduced. My right arm is quite smoothly moving and am able to work many hours without having severe stiffness. They conduct the right physical exercise step by step and the doctors do the manual therapy very thoroughly. Dr.Choe is the person who’s been treating me with his team. They are top notch.</text>

<Review>Life is extra tough right now with Covid and such. So having a compound leg fracture to rehab back to “pro athlete” status is no joke. Staff and place is great. So much that I came back here. 4 years ago had a very serious injury and the Lab helped me get back to competing. A few weeks into rehab I already know and feel, mentally and physically ready for what’s coming! Thank YOU guys so so much. Mike and John and the rest of the staff get 5 stars!< /Review><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b40ef1f641:0x99f4716dec14bacd< /gmap_id><username>PJ Lloyd<//username>< pics>

<user_name>Iris Liu< /user_name><response>None</response><Text>I’ve been a patient at the LAB for about 3 years now. Both Dr. Mike and Dr. John are extremely attentive and have extensive knowledge of what ails the body and how to alleviate pain through muscular therapy as well as the right, targeted exercises to improve mobility and increase strength. I first came to Dr. Mike after I sprained my ankle (again) after a soccer injury. He got me back on my feet so quickly! Since then I’ve seen him for my sciatica and recurrent neck, shoulder, and back pain.

The facilities are clean and right in the heart of downtown. Super convenient back with I worked around the corner. Now in the pandemic, i still see Dr. Mike each week to continue to soothe muscle aches and build strength in the right muscle areas to reduce pain in the future! The staff keeps the facility very clean and sanitized and everyone is wearing a mask at all times, with strict appointment times now to limit the number of people in the facility at one time.

Beyond that the equipment is best in class and I always leave the LAB feeling better then when I walk in! Thanks for all your help over the years!< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< GmapID>

Great staff who works with your busy schedule. Physio will have some discomfort but you're in capable hands with these people.

The location and equipment feels very modern and cutting age so you're to be sure to get the latest and greatest treatment options with them.

I go in during my lunch hour and usually get out before then.</text>

Normally, I don't write reviews about businesses, but I believe that the LAB Doctors truly deserve more recognition. Having done PT before, I thought I knew what to expect when I began to work with Dr. Mike and Dr. John.  However, their level of patient care is so beyond my expectations that I can't believe I had never heard of The LAB before. These doctors will truly provide you with premium care and will make PT fun.

When I had done PT the first time, I didn't enjoy going to PT and skipped sessions occasionally because a.) it hurt, and b.) it was incredibly boring. I met the physical therapist twice over the course of 6 months and did the exercises alone with zero supervision.

At the LAB, however, I get excited about every session and would never even think about canceling for the day. The doctors are incredibly welcoming and friendly, and unlike the place I had done PT at before, Dr. Mike and Dr. John will always walk you through the exercises to make sure that you are practicing good form and that your time is being spent well.

If you are looking for a physical therapist in the Los Angeles Area, I would highly recommend giving the LAB a call. You truly won't regret it.< /review>

They don't call this place the lab for nothing. Doctors Mike and John have a keen eye for sports related injuries and they've been able to get me in and out, feeling like new within a few sessions. I went in with a shoulder injury, and they diagnosed an imbalance I didn't even realize I had. The place is very professional, but without being too formal. You can joke with both the doctors and the interns, and everyone is really friendly, but they're all ready to answer your questions with professionalism, and accuracy. This place doesn't have fancy machines, but that's what's so great about it. They break your injuries down to the basics and build your strength from the ground up. If you're looking for a place that will treat your injuries and rehabilitate your physical imbalances, look no further.<//Text>

<user_name>Laura Barney< /user_name><time>1612815108687</time><rating>5< /rating><review>I came to The Lab Doctors after a disc herniation in my back. I had been having PT for almost six weeks elsewhere and had seen no improvement in my symptoms. I was dealing with severe nerve pain in my leg with tingling and numbness. My ability to function in my daily life had been dramatically affected and I was miserable.

Thankfully, I found Dr. Choe and I am now feel I am on the road to recovery. From my very first visit, I felt like I was in the hands of professionals. Dr. Choe and his team are kind and caring, as well as informative and knowledgable. Within weeks I started to see improvements in my pain and mobility.

I am someone who always has questions and Dr. Choe is always ready to answer my concerns and queries. He also listens when I tell him how my body is feeling and he makes adjustments to treatment when needed. The staff are super friendly and make the mundane experience of physical therapy much more bearable. The location in downtown LA is also bright and airy and a pleasant place to receive treatment. I would definitely recommend The Lab Doctors.</review>< Pictures>

After a lifetime of contact sports and 3 shoulder surgeries, I'm no stranger to physical therapy.  Dr Mike is far and away the most knowledgeable and talented P.T. I've ever seen.  I delayed therapy after my latest surgery, and was afraid I wouldn't get anywhere near 100%.  I'm a few months out from my last session and still haven't had a single issue with the shoulder.  I've even recently started BJJ in my late 30's, which is more than I thought I could hope for.  My thanks to Dr Mike and the staff for turning back the clock on my beat up old body.<//text>

<text>I've been to dozens of Physical Therapy places over the decades and this one is the best. I have old injuries from Football and Track and flare up in my hips and back. Mike and the crew know what they're doing and working with them has significantly reduced pain in my lower back day to day. The facility is clean with a great view.

<Review>I don’t usually ever write reviews, but I felt the obligation to leave Dr.John Pennella a great review, because he’s helped me so much getting through my 18 month injury that I’ve been depressed about. I felt like nobody would figure out what’s wrong with me, I even saw 5 different sports medicine doctors and they all misdiagnosed me.In under 15 minutes this man figured out what I’ve been trying to find out for 18 months by doing physical tests. Most professional therapist I’ve ever encountered, he even answers his emails so quick to respond with very helpful feedback cause he knows I live 2 hours away. He’s also rated one of the best physical therapists in Los Angeles, so that should speak volumes on its own. If you need physical therapy then you need to meet Dr.John!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I was recovering from ACL surgery and The LAB Doctors were great! They set up a training program that strengthen my knee and legs overall. After two months of physical therapy, I feel like I am well on my way to returning to normal. Would recommend!< /Review>

Highly recommend the LAB Doctors.  Professional, knowledgable, and clean. They place a lot of import on continuing education, both in terms of keeping up with current research and using evidence based practice. Dr. John always makes sure to explain what's going on and why. I've never had an instance where I've asked a follow-up question and not had it satisfactorily answered in depth.  These guys are Top Notch!< /Text>

I don't know where to begin in thanking Dr. Mike and Dr. John for their thoughtful, consistent care, but this review is probably a good place to start. I moved to LA mid-last year but had my ACL repaired just a few months prior. On top of that, I was nursing lower back pain and wasn't doing myself any favors moving boxes and building furniture. Fast forward a few weeks, some prescription medication and an MRI later, and I found myself at The Lab meeting Dr. Mike for my initial evaluation. Fast forward some more and I've now been a patient for several months and have seen more relief than I could have imagined. From advising me on exercises to strengthen target areas to correcting some bad habits in order to mitigate further injury, Dr. Mike has helped me navigate the road to recovery. He, along with the entire staff, treats patients with the utmost care and professionalism while also investing the time to get to know them at a personal level. At the end of the day, I consider seeking treatment by Dr. Mike at The Lab as the single decision I made in not only treating my pain, but learning how to prevent it going forward.</text>

I tried chiropractor for 2 months before coming here and it did not help with my herniated disc but this place has improved it a lot. Easy to find DTLA location. Thank you!!</Review>< Pictures>

The treatment I’ve received from him has been great. He was able to quickly assess where the issues were and how to correct them. The exercises he gave me strengthened my legs and glutes and mostly eliminated the pain in those problem areas. His regimen WORKS.

I especially like that Dr. Mike explains what is happening to the muscles and your body as he evaluates you. I’ve recommended several friends here, and I would recommend anyone to Dr. Mike or Dr. John.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b40ef1f641:0x99f4716dec14bacd<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My wife has been going here for about a year and had been repeatedly asking me that I go see Dr. Mike for my rounded shoulder because he has been fanatastic in helping her deal with soreness and pain from bad posture. I finally decided to listen to my wife this month because it was our last week in LA before moving out of state and I figured I had nothing to lose trying it out for 1 week. After the first session with Dr. Mike, I immediately wished that I had listened to my wife earlier in seeing Dr. Mike. He quickly identified problems with my posture and weak areas of my body. To address my issues, he designed excercises to strengthen my weak parts of the body as well as doing treatment. I went there daily for a week (excluding weekends) before I had to move away, but I could feel that my posture has  slightly improved and my weaker muscles have gained some strengths. I just wish I had more time with them.</Review>

Drs John and Michael and they’re staff are outstanding! Hands down the best physical therapy facility and treatment I have ever received. The staff is friendly and welcoming and will work with you to ensure that you get better. The treatment I received from them prior to my shoulder surgery helped the strengthen the muscles around my injury and reduce my recovery time from a few weeks to a few days. I highly recommend their services.</text>

Dr. John is fantastic. Where other physicians were puzzled regarding foot pain I was having that was affecting my work and mobility, he spotted the cause immediately and got me on a course of exercises and treatment that have done wonders. Now, I'm not even remotely a gym person, and the prospect of physical therapy felt a little intimidating to me. My concerns disappeared immediately: the staff is welcoming, professional, and great to work with. If you're in need of physical therapy, I can't recommend this place enough!<//review>

<date>1509125205104<//date><rating>5< /rating><Text>I cannot say enough good things about the team over at The LAB. The staff, the location, the vibe. Everything is encouraging, calming and sensational.

I've had a lower back issue that's been affecting my day-to-day for 6+ months, and before LAB I tried other places with some success, but the pain returned after a few weeks. I had a severe flare up a month ago and looked up The LAB and immediately had hopes this would be the last stop to fix my issues. After reading a few reviews, with others needing 8-10 sessions to get back on track, I was concerned I'd need way more sessions. I was wrong. After the first session, Dr Mike got me feeling way better than previous first sessions at other places. He was excellent: diagnosed my problems immediately and set me on the perfect road to get me way stronger than normal. I only needed a total of 4 sessions to get back to 95%. And it wasn't just the sessions that steered me in the right direction, Dr Mike and his staff gave me the instruction I needed to help me continue the workouts at home in between sessions too. I'm confident that I won't be going back to my old painful ways, but if I do, the team at The LAB taught me what I need to know to get back to full strength. Tremendous thanks to everyone!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< review>
This is a super long overdue review that I should've done earlier since I have been recommending The Lab to all my coworkers (For those of you who work in the DTLA financial district, you MUST check them out)!! I have been going to The Lab since April 2018 after hurting my neck and shoulder from doing at-home workout video without any supervision. Back then I lived on the west side and commuting to DTLA, and I couldn't afford to take a few hours out of my long commute day to go to the UCLA one, which I have been do before. So I decided to start looking for other options in DTLA and luckily I found The Lab.

After a few sessions, the neck and shoulder pain got better, but I wanted to keep going and get stronger to prevent any future injuries. While I jumped around in many different types of workouts (e.g. at-home training videos, gym setting, jogging, hot yoga, pilates, etc.), Dr. Mike answered not only my questions, but also went through certain exercises together even if it's not part of the exercise routine that he made for me (and even including yoga poses!!).

Even if I exercised to prevent any future injuries, I knew sitting down all day long and working 60-70+ hours a week would break my body down sooner or later. At The Lab, a session is structured as a combination of treatment and workout. There were many sessions where I could only get the treatment because either I worked past midnight the night before or I have to get back to work. Thanks to those treatment, I was able to survive through busy season at work!!

I really wish Dr. Mike and Dr. John open up another office here in Minneapolis!! My experience with The Lab was awesome and not sure if I can be satisfied with anywhere else (fingers crossed).<//review>

The LAB is a top notch office. Dr. John has taken a really tough situation (my ignored injury) and helped me heal in a short amount of time. I thought I was going to need surgery, but with Dr. John's care, my ankle has strengthened significantly and it looks like I will not need surgery after all. Dr. John has a skill set that is unbeatable. He pushes you to work towards your recovery and his staff is professional and kind. My favorite part at the LAB is when he works on my injury at the table with massage, ultrasound and heat/ice pack to finish. Most physical therapy offices I've been to do not give you this personal care/attention which is one of the most important parts of the healing process! I highly recommend the LAB. The office is clean, modern & has killer DTLA views. The equipment is new & reflects today's standard. I am so thankful to have met such a wonderful team. They have changed my life for the better!< /text>

These guys already have many stellar reviews so I feel like I don't have much value to add, but I've received such amazing care over the last 8 weeks that I feel I need to. I've had chronic back pain for the last 3.5 years and had horrible experiences with PT before so I was hesitant to try these guys. But after a coworker's recommendation and looking at all of their positive reviews on Google/Yelp, I thought I'd give them a shot. And I am SO GLAD that I did! They worked miracles with my insurance so I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket. (That alone should tell you how great these guys are!) During the first visit,  Dr. John did a consultation where he got to know my injury and medical history. Then he designed some exercises for me to do to strengthen my lower back. Every visit, I'd do the exercises with some of his staff (who are all AMAZING by the way) and then Dr. John himself would stretch me out and put me on a muscle stim device. Doing that for 6-8 weeks has helped me go from taking pain medication every day to taking them once or twice a week. Thanks to the Lab Drs, I feel so much more aware of and in control of my pain. They have 100% changed my life and I cannot thank them enough. I HIGHLY recommend them for anyone who needs PT!</text>

I cannot recommend The Lab Doctors highly enough. After almost a year of constant pain, Dr. Mike assessed the problem and got to work in the first session. After four sessions, I'm walking without pain in my toes, did my first lunge in about 10 months, and can sense that the pain in my leg is easing with every session. Even Dr. John, who has never seen me privately, knows my name and greets me by name every time I walk in the room. SO professional, high quality, genuinely nice guys!<//text>

A great experience any way you look at it. The central DTLA location is easy to access, the staff welcoming and friendly and, most importantly, the care excellent. I arrived, barely walking, with a training injury and ran a half marathon sIx and a half weeks later. Thank you Mike! I’d give six stars if I could!</Text>

I recently had ACL reconstruction and cartilage repair, followed by 11 weeks on crutches. I've been going to The Lab for about 2 months now and Dr. Mike has helped me make great progress and actually has me ahead of where I expected to be in my recovery! Dr. Mike has been great in identifying any minor issues I have had along the way and quickly suggests ways to help. The exercises I've been given for my knee are varied and challenge me the perfect amount, and these are followed-up by manual work and electrotherapy when I'm in for my PT sessions.

The space is bright, clean and spacious, and the downtown location is great. Both Dr. Mike and Dr. John are super knowledgable, friendly and take a vested interest in your recovery. I'd highly recommend The Lab to anyone!</text>

The facility reminded me of a hybrid of a cross-fit gym and an open-space therapy room. The place is spacious with a modern touch. Real suave.

I visited Dr. Mike Choe, DPT, to receive consultation and treatment for pain management. He personally took the time to listen to my discomfort, provided hands-on stretching to find the source of the pain, and consulted different exercise routines to mitigate tensions on my lower back. He also provided me with running tips by recording my (running) form. Turned out my center of gravity is quite low. He is very knowledgable in his profession and truly enjoys helping people.

What separates Dr. Mike from other PTs is that he really cares for his patients. He followed up with a text to check up on my condition. How awesome is that!? He really went above and beyond.<//text>

<review>I injured my ACL and was worried that I would need a surgery.
Thanks to John and his team I was able to recover without the need of a surgery.
I started playing football again!
Thanks John, I'll be waiting for you back here in Argentina!

I called last minute and they were able to get to my place the next day. The technician called in advance so I knew he was coming and then walked through with me to find out what any concerns were. He was done very quickly. It was super professional and easy. I definitely recommend them.< /Review>

This company undercharges for the quality of service provided. Adding a trip charge when customer is located further then a specific distance like further then 20miles, or adding a no show fee when customer isn’t there might be something to consider. Service was great, y’all really helped us out through our situation. It just doesn’t feel like we paid you what your worth. This place goes above and beyond. Blessed to have found y’all. Thanks!</Text>

Answered and setup the year service. They were able to come the next day. Talked about my issue both on the phone and with the guy who came out. Both were super professional and knew their stuff. Were hopeful it works well as he said what I already knew, "you have a lot of ants". Glad I called.<//review>

Giovani called me back a few minutes after I submitted a form off their website and the next day, right on time, Christian showed up at my place and did a vastly more thorough examination of my place than the other companies did, going so far as to climb into the attic (a horrible, tiny place) and under the house (equally horrible and tiny).

<Text>I am so glad that I contacted Dash Pest Control. I almost didn’t because I’m not located in Ventura County, but they service the San Fernando Valley! Yay.  Giovanni was very professional on the phone and was available to send someone out pronto. We opted for service today, several days after my call. Jose was on time, friendly and went over our entire yard spraying, removing webs and set a couple of traps. He answered additional questions that I had not thought of while talking to Giovanni. Their contract is easy to understand and fill out online, super convenient! The mixture that they sprayed is safe, I let my four legged baby out an hour after they left.

Very happy with this first time service. Will update down the road.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Jacob was quick and professional. He answered my concerns about cats and how quickly we would see a reduction in spiders. My neice was refusing to go unto her bedroom because she saw 2 very large spuders go under her bed and into the closet. I was concerned about my cats, but he said we only needed to leave for an hour while the product dried and that the product was safe for pets.<//Review>< UserId.>

Arrived at the time they said they would come. The technician was very courteous, mindful of the property. And even said if we have a problem within the next couple of weeks just call them they’ll come back out to do a redo. So we’re definitely off to a great start<//Text>

We had a big problem with ants when we moved into our house. We decided to try Dash and have been very satisfied ever since. No more ants! They are timely and always give notice prior to coming. There have been times when we notice more spiders or other pests and they are willing to come out and treat the house again in between our regular treatments without extra charge. I have two dogs and two little kids and are happy that what they use is safe for them. I would definitely recommend Dash!<//Review>

Contacted Dash a few days ago. With the heat, the pests are out in force. Their pricing is fair and they were at my house in just a few days doing the work. Technician was great as well. Very thorough. I am very happy to say that I made the right choice is working with Dash. I highly recommend you give them a call.</Review>

I’d refer dash to anyone. They always do a great job. I have 3 huskies that can make things difficult, but dash is always very accommodating. Specifically Christian does a great job at working around them and making sure they are never at harm while not missing anything. We’ve always had a ton of spiders and don’t have that issue anymore thanks to them.<//Review>

<Review>We have been using Dash for about 6 months now and are very pleased with the service. We went to some spider and other insect around daily to hardly ever seeing them. Anytime we do see activity pick up, they come out and take care of it. The last few times we had Cris show up and he has been great. He’s fast, but still takes the time to do the job right. Another great thing is the email you a picture of who is coming so you know the person your letting onto your property is the person that belongs there. Thanks Cris and Dash for the great service!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Love love love Dash! I’ve had at least 5 pest control companies in the past including trying to DIY with Home Depot spray... the spiders & tiny bugs always find a way in! With Dash, huge improvement... best of all, the pest control guys are the BEST! They’re so responsive and polite... they even fill up the dog water outside!<//Review>

DASH has been an excellent service since I started out with them. Their technicians are professional and friendly, as well as thorough and efficient. They are extremely responsive to every inquiry I have and are able to schedule follow up appointments immediately, when needed.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I’ve been using Dash since we moved to Goleta 5 years ago. We had an initial roach and ant problem and thief treatment and ongoing maintenance has put them in check.

The service tech came out this morning. Rang the doorbell and announced himself. He’s was stepped back from the door and was wearing a face covering as mandated by local officials.

He also suggested we close the kitchen door while he was spraying around the backyard.

Simple, respectful and helpful.

We continue to be pleased with the services.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1602029222993, 'text': 'Thanks for letting us service your home Matilda!  We appreciate the business.'}</resp><GmapID>0x80e8366c5549f0f5:0x2ddd30d84039a534< /GmapID></record>

<Review>We have had an increasing ant problem. I have never used an outside vendor to treat our home but the problem was getting worse.  I messaged them this morning and someone was at my house to treat at 2pm.  Great price, great customer service!  And when I got home there was not an ant in sight 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<//Review>< GmapID>

These are the guys you hope will show up to do the job but seldom do.  Great company that does what they say and aren't trying to upsell you on more services you don't want or need.  Both office and field professionals are top drawer.  I couldn't be more pleased!  Thanks Giovanni & Christian!!</Text>

I was freaking out because this was the first time I ever had cockroaches in my apartment!! I googled and Terminex and Dash came up so I called for a quote from both places. It was Ben’s conversation with me and the way in which he handled me that I decided to use his service. They had very affordable options for me and they did not disappoint!!
Jose came out and was my guy to spray and educated me on how I probably got the cockroaches.. DASH Pest Control is honest and affordable  .. THANK YOU for giving me peace of mind guys!!< /review>

When we first moved into our house we found it to be infested with ants. They, in turn, attracted spiders. Dash eliminated our insect problem and we have been happy with their service for a few years now. If bugs come back between service calls they immediately return and fix the problem. We are very satisfied with Dash and highly recommend them.</text>

We had a horrific ant problem.  It was immediately over with DASH.  spiders were crazy with the heat DASH came out to take care of the problem, even twice without charge.  Our dog has not had flees with no medication.
We have a rental as well and DASH takes care of everything.  It has been a good investment.< /text>

Update.  Servicer called immediately to rectify situation I listed below. 15 min. Afyer leaving review. Wanted to send mr usual guy Jacob out next day. Servicer was on time . Made contact sprayed where I needed. Courteous,
Will continue using them.

Today im not happy. A different tech was sent out. No contact. I wanted him to pray my gage. He supposedly came 40 min before time. He said he sprayed a fence we have no fence. No note left saying he was even here.
I love my other c technician Jacob.
I've asked only for him. He always knocks on door asks anything in house. I have no proof he was even here. First bad service in 4. Well see.< /Review>

First I want to say the office staff is excellent.  Cindy goes beyond to help but that only helps if the other employees do the same. I have an organic vegetable garden and last year when pests started to show up they dropped the ball. I have to say they showed up but came without the proper insecticide several times and by the time they did show up it was too late and I lost a large section of my vegetables. You are thinking “why did She continue using them?”  Well the office staff is great and they promised it would not happen again. It did and their tech Jose is rude and unprofessional leaving my home and not providIng services. So I am in the same position again with a dying vegetable garden. Needless to say, I need to find a new pest control service. So if you love your garden and yard don’t depend on dash to do the job.</Text>

The owner, Giovanni was very informative about my situation. The technician arrived and educated me as to what would be happening on the property to eradicate my ant problem and was very quick and efficient. I will be referring others that live here at the RV ranch community to the service.< /review>

I have had Dash on contract for several years now. I really like them. I gave them 4 stars though because their service isn't always consistent. It seems like some employees are more thorough than others. It also makes a difference if you're home when they come by or not. Which it obviously shouldn't, since they service the back and front yards. I have cameras and some employees are more lax than others. Don't misunderstand me, they don't do anything wrong, just maybe slack a little. The majority of the time, they're great. I'm actually leaving a review today because the employee that came to the house a couple days ago, Christian, was great. He was thorough and knowledgeable. I have also found that the employees in the office are very nice and helpful. Overall, I would definitely recommend this company.</text>

< review>
"The Best of The Best" When I first purchased my home in Thousand Oaks we had an infestation of rats in our back yard which was over grown and not maintained in years. After dealing with Terminex who were the worst unethical company I could have imagine, I found Dash on Yelp. They have been so incredibly responsive to our calls and following up on the issues. Today with the a lot of maintenance later and the professional help from Dash Pest Control we are able to enjoy our entire property. Also they are very competitively priced and never try to over sell you.<//review>

<Review>Dash has come and sprayed my room twice for bed bugs in the past week. Both times I have had to bag and either dry or leave all of my clothes and bedding in the sun. I am still seeing bugs which means I am going to have to have them come back a third time. I’m a college student who doesn’t have a lot of free time. Currently I have all of my clothes in bags in my car because I am scared to bring them into my room while there are still bugs active. Overall very bad experience so far.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>These guys know what they are doing, I've setup for quarterly treatments and since then all the sugar ants are gone, there's no spiders making their way into the bathroom, the silverfish are out of the kitchen and bathrooms. Really nice customer service, you can ask the techs anything and they'll answer or call you back after getting the answer. So, kudos to dash.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>Giovanni Listened to my rodent issue and was kind respectful and  reassuring  That the issue would be taken care of. I was lucky enough to have one of his crew working in my area so within 30 minutes I had Jose doing what was necessary to take care of the problem. Jose too was respectful and assured me the problem will be taken care of. I am very optimistic and would highly recommend Dash Pest Control to my friends!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Time>1551234022350<//Time>< GmapID>

These guys are amazing!  They're, hands down, the best way to control the crazy pests we get in southern California.  Their service is super low-key, but effective. Our ant problem was literally solved overnight, and without any invasive procedures or harsh chemicals so we know our kids and pets are safe.  Now, their regular visits keep the pests away before we ever even notice them. We receive reminders via email and text before each treatment and they're in and out before we realize it.  All this for a price that is beyond fair!  Dash gives us the piece of mind of knowing that our babies are safe from both creepy crawlies and nasty chemicals. 👍👍</review>

DASH has come out 3 times now to service my house for pests. Twice to spray all around and once when I came across a large critter in my house. Each of the technicians, including Jose and Christian were professional and very thorough. I’m very happy with this company and would recommend it to anyone.< /review>

Dash pretty much kills it.  They are always on time. I've used them for two years now and have literally no complaints.  What else can you ask for with a company.  They show up.  They do their job.  They do it right.  Enough said.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Whether you own or rent your home, Dash Pest Control is truly your best solution to staying critter free year round.    Ants/spiders/flies etc are treated with non toxic and organic sprays that completely work— and their service guys are so gracious and hard working — like old fashioned customer service!  I actually look forward to them coming to do their seasonal treatments  :)</review>< Pictures>

Dash Pest Control visits are courteous and professional. We’re happy with their service and the results eliminating the spiders and ants at our house. Their quarterly inspections and treatment is working for our home in Ventura and a call back in between to deal with pests has been timely with excellent results.
Christian was hear for our scheduled treatment and patiently listened to my explanation seeing scout ants. He did his job with no disruption in 1/2 hour. Thank you Dash Pest Control!< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Ignacio is a great guy! He really knows his stuff and makes it his goal to handle your pest problem. Not once did he try to up-sell me on monthly service or anything I did not ask for. His boss, Ben is a real nice guy too. I only spoke with him on the phone but he too was informative and made it his goal to fix our problem. I thought I had rats in the attic. I was quoted $299 to find them, set traps inside and outside if necessary and a return visit to get rid of the animals caught... Ignacio investigated and discovered I did not have rats. The service call cost $49 total, $250 less than quoted!! DASH is my new Pest Control Company.
Many Thanks,

I’m really liking my pest control people - Dash Pest Control. They are keeping my house free of bugs and spiders and were quick to take  care of the mice problem we had. Their technicians do a great job at keeping the webs at bay and are always ask if there are any areas that need extra attention. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Definitely recommend their services.</text>

Let me sum up my experience with the Dash people: they are much, much more than just pest control phenoms; they are genuine human beings...literally! In terms of their service, before them I always felt like the pests were strategically positioning to invade my home to overthrow it - I was losing control. Now, whenever I speak to a Dash representative, it's almost like I have my very own military force at my beck and call to defend against any mass assault or coup. They're so effective. Keep it up guys!< /review>

DASH pest control is Awesome!!!
I had a problem with Ants that I just couldn't get rid of. DASH sprayed the house inside and outside on the 1st visit and within 30 minutes the Ants were gone. ...and I haven't seen any spiders either. The employees are very professional and really take the time to access your needs and talk about what your home needs to get rid of ants, spiders,..ect.
I highly recommend using DASH pest control.< /text>

Great attention to detail and results. Our home is suceptible to quite a bit of activity being at the edge of the mountain and we have experienced great care and success with Dash. I highly recommend their service.</Review>

Love these people. They started treating my property 3 years ago due to black widows and ants. They came every 3 months in the first year and then every six months after that. I've had no bugs since.<//Text>

This is the place for me. Growing up catholic as a child and  the lord always in my heart ❤️as an adult  I lost my way and couldn’t connect back to Catholic Church. I knew in my heart how much I needed the lord in my life . I then found Calvary chapel. The 1st day I was there I felt I found my way back to the lord🙏 I’ve been saved since 1999 and been coming since. I love it here because pastor Poncho gives a beautiful worship service we’re I can understand the word of god. Also the people who gather there, great each other with kindness and respect. Most of all everyone is welcome here. Not putting any church down, but this is the place for me. Thank you 🙏 Lord</Text>

Love this church and Pastor Pancho Juarez. Been attending on an off for almost 25 years. If you want to learn about God and what it's all about, make this your own home church. May God continue to bless Pastor and his family and church family 🙏<//review>

<Review>Love this place of Love & Respect for everyone and anyone that wants to be by yourself but not alone. It’s an opened armed hug to all, from whatever & wherever the road you traveled on. The words used here is “Brother & Sister”, that will light up your self esteem to an refreshing new outlook. If you ever wanted to take a quick look at what can be and what you possibly can become, come out, sit in the back and just listen... You need not say anything to anyone. Just give it a LOOK & HEAR...... it won’t hurt anyone.

<Text>I first seen Pastor Pancho at Harvest Christian church in riverside When I lived out there he was standing in for Pastor Greg and I really liked his preaching and how he connects with everyone he really preaches God’s word to the Bible and makes everyone feel welcomed when I moved to Los Angeles I found his church and started going i’ve been going for the last year I haven’t actually met anyone or joined any of the women groups but I do love going to Calvary Chapel  Montebello feel so at home here and Pastor Pancho’s preaching is straight from the Bible and he preaches so clearly I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a church home.</Text>< Pics>

It was a great experience for me and my family, the members of the body were real and kind, the church is the result of ordinary people doing God's work. I highly recommend attending the Ark of Montebello or listening to Pancho and the Pastors if you want to hear God's word.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>This is my home church I've been coming here since "2007. Love the Pastor and the church. There's so much to do. Our grandaughters enjoy it very much. We also have a summer Vacational Bible Study for a week. Come bring your kids they will have LOTS of fun learning and growning at their grade level along with that they will get served a lite lunch. If your child/children have allergies to certain foods, they will only be given what they can eat.
See you there and God Bless!🙏<//Review><Rate>5</Rate>< GmapID>

The greatest pastor, Pastor Pancho makes you cry, makes you laugh, he gives you life experience stories that make you re-think about the way you're living life and make you want to be a better wife a better husband a better father a better mother, you'll improve your living habits for good....HIGHLY RECOMENDED¡!

The people are very welcoming and loving.  I didn't know where to take my kids and I asked some one who dropped what they were doing to walk me and show me where each class was.  The word of God totally ministered to each one of my family that attended.  The Lord is totally using this church to proclaim his word.  The message was on point!!!</Text>

it has been a great blessing to be a part of this ministry the word of God is explained so well with no going around the message or sugar coating it. you truly can see clearly there is only one way Jesus. it is a bible reading church to see it is being cut or misleading.  so many outreach and children ministry's.  A great place to hear God's Word< /Text>

I've been attending My Home Fellowship for a few Years now .The Pastor & His Wife have a Heart to follow God in Truth & humility .A love for the lost, misplaced , hurting  and questioning Life . Verse by verse Bible teaching .Many outreach ministries to meet the needs of the community. Arrive and be greeted with a warm Smile and Leave feeling encouraged by God's Mighty word .God has had his Hand over CCM for 25 years & I pray that He will continue</text>

I have been her like my whole life I'm thirteen and this is my second home. Pastor Pancho is a great pastor. Not only is he AMAZING at preaching but he keeps his services very interesting and he'll crack some jokes here and there. All of the pastors of the pastoral are also amazing the will stop what they are doing to pray for you or to answer a question. If they aren't doing anything they might just spark up a conversation. Also the teachers at the childrens ministry are fabulous they will love your child as if it is there own. A lot of the teacher I have hade have hade an amazing impact on me and I still remember them to this day. I am currently in the jr. high and the teachers there are amazing. They will ask you how you are doing and if you are playing a sport they just might play with you! If you are in a tough position in your life they will pray for you and love on you. Then the next time you see them they will ask you how that situation is going and will continue to pray for you. All in all this is an amazing church. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recomend this church if you are looking for a church to attend or if your on the fence with this church. Thank you for making my life filled with God. God bless you all. LOVE THIS CHURCH!</Text>

<Text>I usually dont take the time to evaluate corporations because there's such a thing as its "all in the eye of the beholder". However, this is coming from an enlightenment point of view. Today was my first visit ever & I'd like to share a token of the the positive energy that I experienced. The feeling of empowerment that I picked up from pastor Pancho as he was preaching was priceless. The wealth of his ability to translate the words of Jesus Crist so we understand it better, & perceive it in a manner that we can then reflect upon is amazing. The connection with him meets at a personal level because he actually took a moment to meet & know me even for just a min. he made himself available, I can tell he's willing to do the same with every new face that walks through those doors. I really approve & appreciate how he keeps his audience in tune with his awesome sense of humor. It's my pleasure to provide feedback to help my fellow friends & family who in our near future would like to consider giving their heart a chance to rejoice & find hope, faith, moral support & none-the-less a special kind of guidance at this ministry. At last, but not least,  I  observed as the staff worked so well together to make sure that theres a good and consistent flow in paking, child care, and sitting etc. which is very important me, thank you for helping me feel welcomed.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Pastor Ponch makes the word of God feel like I'm going to a concert "excited " always anticipate the messege. Love his humor "ay"  lol the greeters and the ushers, the drivers and the rest of the people at calvary chaoel make you feel welcomed, but above all at the end of the service I leave
with a smile and armed with gods messege. Every Sunday I learn something new and/or I finally understand what certain verses mean.
I feel in my heart that Pastor Ponch is indeed one of God's messengers because he delivers his messege right down to the core without leaving room for any questions that's how good he is with  deliverance of the word.</text>

Took my daughter and was seen by Dr Nadia. I can’t begin to explain how amazing my experience was. She was so gentle and understanding throughout the procedure. She explained everything to me and my 5 year old daughter who was so nervous. I am so happy we chose this amazing team!!! Thank you to the best doctors and the amazing staff. We appreciate you guys!!!< /Review>

I took my son for his first dental visit and I couldn't be happier for choosing  Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos they were so friendly. My son had just fallen asleep and they were so understanding & patient. They also gave us a tour making us feel very welcomed. The place is very clean, organized and very kid friendly.  They also have a family waiting area with changing table for the little ones. We scheduled his second appointment, I definitely found the perfect dentist for my little one! Thank you for the great experience Pediatric Dentistry Of San Marcos!<//review>

<review>It was a great experience. The facility is very nice. The nurses and Dentist were patient with my son(3 years old) as well. They have a tv in the ceiling to distract the kids while getting their work done. Overall great 1st appointment and excited to go back.< /review>< pictures>

As a first time dental patient, the office staff made my  child feel welcomed and at ease. Gave us a tour when we arrived and went over every step of the cleaning and X-ray process to my child.
Beautiful location, extremely clean, warm, attentive staff with so much patience for kids, and great colors and movie options to keep kids engaged.
I was recommended this office by a friend and now I will be highly recommending this office to other parents. My 4 year old son can't wait to go back!</Review>< response>

Amazing dentist office for children. I had a VERY scared eight year old today and they put him at ease and made him feel so comfortable with every thing they did!! We also had our two year old in today for her very first visit and again they did an amazing job being gentle and reassuring. Would recommend to all!</Text>

Dr. Bala and the dental assistants here are amazing. They always make my kids feel comfortable with great bedside manner and by explaining everything they’re doing in an easy to understand way for kiddos. The pricing is reasonable and I’ve never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for an appointment. I highly recommend them!< /Review>

This morning I brought my son and daughter for their checkups. The overall experience was great. Easy parking, modern/fun office space, and clean/engaging treatment rooms with great technology. Dr. Allen was his usual friendly, professional, and gentle self. His staff made the appointment easy and streamlined.< /review>

My kids always love going to the dentist! They used to be so anxious about it, especially my daughter, but Dr. Nadia and her staff have such a calmness about them and it has helped to really reduce the anxiety and make going to the dentist a pleasant experience!< /review>

I took both of my kids here after I was not so happy with another dentist we tried in Escondido. They worked with my daughter and autistic son (4 yrs.). They were super accommodating, caring, and helpful. I will continue to take the kids here and would recommend this office to others. Thank you!</text>

I can’t recommend Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos enough! I wish a place like this existed when I was a kid. For parents: Dr. Allen and his staff are very professional, do a thorough job, answer questions, explain the procedures beforehand, allow parents in room, and let you know what to expect in the future which is helpful for when your child is growing/ losing teeth. The office is extremely clean and kid-friendly. For kids: They have movies in the ceiling and they let you wear headphones and sunglasses while you get your teeth checked out. The dental assistants are very nice and gentle. They even give you a goodie bag with a new toothbrush and stickers. My daughter looks forward to her visit every 6 months and she’s been cavity free!</Review>

The office is very clean and the staff was very helpful & friendly. We saw Doctor Allen and he was very thorough, and gave our son an extensive exam-with no tears. Such a different experience from most health/dental care providers. Not once did we feel rushed. This place is awesome!

Second time and it was better than the first. My son left smiling and didn’t shed a tear. Highly recommend this place!</Review>

I cannot say enough of Dr. Nadia. She is so kind and gentle. She has been seeing my 6yr old for 2 years now, and she loves her. My 11yr old sees a different dentist (she has different insurance) and she gets extreme anxiety when she visits any doctor, to the point where she starts crying. In a recent visit for my 6yr old,  Dr. Nadia went out of her way to talk to my oldest, and even took a quick peek at her teeth. I was shocked when we walked out of the office and my daughter requested to have Dr. Nadia be her dentist. She is amazing!< /Text>

<Review>This place is everything you could hope for in a pediatric dental clinic.  We have seen both dentists and have had nothing but a wonderful experience.  Its clear that they are both very knowledgable and very interested in the best outcome for the child.  On both occasions, we have received very extensive explanations (which really helps you know you are making the right choices for your child).  Neither dentist tried to sell us or push us towards a specific direction; instead, they lay out the information and offer their knowledge and training as a resource.  Both were willing to spend a lot of time with us too.   Highly recommend.

Also, the place is spotless...the hygiene is superb.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I highly recommend Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos, Dr. Nadia Bala is wonderful. My four daughters all love going to the dentist and have no fear when it comes to visiting Dr. Nadia. She makes their experience pleasant and comfortable. Even my two year old willingly sits in the chair and gets her teeth cleaned all by herself. We are so blessed to have found such an honest dentist that truly Cares about her little patients.</Text>

Dr. Nadia is hands down THE best pediatric dentist I have EVER been to! My kids always look forward to their visits. I must admit I was a little nervous about going this past week with this CoVid pandemic going on,...but not after we went and saw how careful they were in making preparations and taking precautions in keeping us safe. Everyone was wearing double masks, plus a face shield!!....and long sleeve shirts and gloves of course. I also noticed  all the tools they brought out were individually wrapped, which added additional peace of mind. It’s obvious they pay close attention to detail! It’s a super clean office and everyone is so friendly!! We just love Dr. Nadia! She is one of a kind and relates so well with kids and parents alike! She even walked us out of the office and made sure we all got our own squirt of hand sanitizer before we left. It’s the little things!! 💛 This is truly a ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Dentistry!!</review>

<review>This is the best dentist I found since I moved here from the East Coast 2 years ago. My kids are nervous dental patients (although they've never had any cavities). The office was very patient, and explained everything to both me and them, which I felt was important. The kids got VIP treatment with ceiling tvs and headsets to watch movies while they got their teeth cleaned. In the end, they each got a new toothbrush and a goodie bag. We will be sticking with them. The doctor and attendants are all great!< /review>< pictures>

My son has always been nervous/scared of the dentist since his first dentist appointment. We started seeing Dr. Allen last year when my son was 9 years old. That was the first time my son had a positive experience at the dentist. Prior to coming to Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos, we have been to other well known pediatric dentists. None were as calm and patient as Dr. Allen. Besides his professionalism and ability to communicate effectively, Dr. Allen was very honest about the procedures my son needed. Unlike other dentist who try to up sell or recommend costly procedures, I genuinely felt that he was giving the same advice to me as he would give his family. I trust my son’s dental health in the capable hands of Dr. Allen and his staff. Give them a try and you will not be disappointed! Also, during the times of Covid-19, we felt very safe and confident that all necessary precautions were taken to keep everyone healthy.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

As always, making an appointment with this office is super easy. This office was closed during state mandated office closure from March-May and my kids were overdue for their checkup. However, I am glad that this business cares more about public safety than business gains. Well, they are back and so are we. Since my insurance pays for 2 visits anytime of the year, I’m just going to bring the kids back again in 4 months and get back on schedule.< /review>

My 3 yr old knocked a tooth out, and they were able to squeeze us in last minute before we were leaving on a trip to make sure she was ok. They got us in quickly, did a thorough exam including x-rays, and also did a wonderful job of explaining what things we needed to be keeping an eye on and what to do to make sure things healed properly. Thank you Dr. Allen!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< date>

We absolutely love them! I am very picky about a dentist and the office for my boys and Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos does not disappoint. The office is clean, the staff is friendly, you are in private rooms, and Drs. Greg Allen and Nadia Bala are both amazing with kids and very knowledgeable.< /Text>

<review>Dr Bala and Dr Allen have been the most amazing dentists for my three boys. Both dentists genuinely kind, above and beyond patient, really take the time to listen to concerns, and always maintain an extremely clean office with lots cheery & bright colors.  I feel like we are treated like family when we see Dr Bala! She has an amazing memory of my boys dental history and takes great notes so she can remember the small details in order to help make each visit a great experience! I’m so happy we have found such amazing pediatric dentists!<//review>< Pics>

Ultimately, I chose this office for my grandson’s first dental appointment because of the reviews I read online.  Let me back up these reviews by saying this was, hands down, the best experience.  The staff was so welcoming and pleasant- but to take it even further, I appreciated their professionalism and confidence.  I can’t get over how immaculate the office was.  I am a 19 year dental professional myself, and I am overly observant (and probably too judgmental) in all dental offices.  I felt totally comfortable with the infection control standards that I witnessed.  Spotless!!  The assistant and the doctor worked so well together, which will in turn make your child’s appointment go so smoothly.  I’ll close with that because it’s starting to sound like a paid advertisement. :D A+++++<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dc754f8b282835:0x9f1fa6d59601e65d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos definitely saved my child from weeks of pain! They were the only office out of all the once I called in TWO county’s that took me in the same day after explaining my sons situation. Once we arrived they were super friendly explained everything in detail and were very well trained in keeping my son calm and comfortable throughout his procedure. Thank you girls!</Text>

Best dentist around! My expectations are beyond met. I feel lucky to have found such a good place for my children. Dr. Nadia was great! She was patient, she explained everything to us and really cared for my sons. I will certainly be telling everyone i know about this office.< /review>

Dr. Allen and his staff are amazing! They really care about your child, and do their best to make them feel at ease. They welcome questions, and will explain things in a manner that you can understand.

When we first started there my little girl would crawl under my chair. They were exceptionally patient with her, and now she looks forward to seeing the dentist! I never thought she would allow anyone to touch her head let alone work in her mouth.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!<//Review>

Dr. Allen and his staff were amazing!  The office was beautifully decorated and organized.  The staff was kind and efficient.  The hygienist was able to get my three year-old to lie back in the exam chair, something he had refused to do anywhere else.  Dr. Allen was very gentle and knowledgeable, it was clear he is an expert in his field.  We are so lucky we found him!<//Text>

<Review>My 3 boys have been seeing Dr. Allen for several years now and he is just the absolute best. After trying out a few other dentists, we finally found somewhere we can trust and receive the best care. The TVs on the ceiling are SOO nice and do a great job keeping them distracted.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Took my 14 month old to get her first dentist check up and she did so well! It was easy making an appointment thanks to the front desk receptionist Nancy. She was super sweet and very accommodating with my schedule. We got to see Dr. Allen who did so well with my daughter. Definitely will be making all our future appointments here.</Text>< pics>

Everyone at Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos is WONDERFUL! They knew my son was nervous so they explained everything to him several times, answered his questions and reassured him that everything was going to be okay multiple times. We couldn’t ask for a better dentist for him!< /review>

<review>We love Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos! Dr. Allen and the staff are always so friendly and kind.  They have a great way with children.  Both Dr. Allen and the hygienist take their time to explain everything that is going to be done beforehand so there are no surprises for the kids. Both of my boys (ages 2.5 and 5.5) make it through routine cleanings without a problem because Dr. Allen and the staff always make the process so easy.  My older son needed some work done for a cavity, and he did so well, again, because Dr. Allen and the staff took the time to really make sure that my son (and his nervous mother!) understood what was going on beforehand and during the procedure.  You also never feel rushed with Dr. Allen.  He really listens to your concerns and is happy to answer any questions.  I would highly, highly recommend Dr. Allen and his staff to anyone.</review>< rate>

< Review>
Both Drs we have seen here were amazing, all staff had been very personable and patient with my son. Dr Allen was great when I had to bring my three year old in for an emergency check because of a fall, he was very anxious and didn’t ant anyone touching his mouth. After a lot of reassurance from the Dr he finally trusted him enough to proceed with the exam. Highly recommended this establishment!<//Review>

<Review>I love Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos! My (almost) 5 year old has been going there since he was an infant (and I had a concern about his teeth). The staff is always amazing and friendly and the office is very welcoming, especially for the children.
Dr. Nadia takes the time every time to address any of my concerns and does and great job at making sure I understand everything that is going on.
The rooms are set up so that the kiddos feel as comfy as possible so that they aren’t scared, which has made such a difference! My son loves going to the dentist because of the environment and I love going because of how great the care and service is!</Review>< Resp>

The first time I took my son to the Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos, he was terrified because of his previous experience at a different dentist office.  He quickly changed his attitude towards the dentist thanks to the amazing staff.  I am so happy that I don't have to stand in the corner and cry as much as my little boy, as I watched him cry in pain while getting a tooth extracted.  Now the experience is way better.  Many, many thanks to the Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos for the amazing professionalism in their practice on kids.< /text>

Dr. Allen has been our kids’ dentist for the last few years when we moved to the area. I am a lifelong client. He is so patient with our 3 and 5 year olds. We were supposed to have my oldest’s tooth removed in mid-March but with the pandemic, it got postponed. The office was in touch with us through the lockdown and finally called to do the procedure so it didn’t cause further issues down the road. Dr. Allen was so patient with my son, explained and walked my son through the whole process, and sneakily gave him the numbing shots without my son realizing it. They are fantastic! And the front office staff and dental hygienists are so friendly!!!</text>

Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos was a very pleasant visit for my daughter and I. She is 4, and they made her feel very comfortable. Our Dentist Nadia Bala, was very knowledgeable, sweet, and took the time to explain everything. We have not had a procedure done here yet, but I feel that it will go very smoothly.< /Text>

<Text>Words can not express how amazing Dr. Allen and his team are. His hygienist was so patient. She was able to help my daughter throughout our visit. Dr. Allen spoke with my daughter in a way that made her feel important.

We left our local pediatric dentistry and found Dr. Allen, who is so worth every minute of the almost-hour drive.  My daughter is going to need extensive dental work with the use of anesthesia. Dr. Allen spoke, in terms that I could understand, about the condition of my daughter’s teeth and the amount of work that was going to be needed to set the foundation for healthier teeth. My daughter will require sedation with anesthesia for the amount of work that will have to be done. As a parent, I have seen one too many tragic news reports about children and dental sedation. I was extremely worried and hesitant about the use of anesthesia on my daughter. Dr. Allen put all my concerns and fears to rest (no pun intended). He explained how safety measures would be of the utmost importance and his team of doctors would be present to monitor my daughter every step of the way. I felt reassured by Dr. Allen and am proceeding dental work with the use of anesthesia for her.

I am so happy and pleased to have found Pediatric Dentristry of San Marcos. If you are looking for a pediatric dentist, look no further. Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos is AMAZING.<//Text></record>

<Text>We have been taking our daughter here since she was just 3 years old, and now she’s almost 8! We couldn't have picked a better place! Dr. Nadia and Dr. Alan, and all their staff are amazing. Everyone is kind and more importantly, we trust them. The best part is our daughter doesn't put up a fight to go. The office itself is very clean, kid friendly, the pricing and services are clear...there isn’t one negative thing I would say. I highly recommend this place to anyone. I wish adults could go here!</Text>< pics>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>This was my 3 year old's second time going to a dentist. Our experience was OK at the first visit. The first visit at a different dentist we were not in our own room but among other patients, sitting in a row of dentist chairs. That place was packed with waiting patients as well. There were so many people and we were not called in until 30 minutes later.

Now let me tell you about our visit to Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos. This experience was 10x better than the first! We entered the suite, checked in with minimal paperwork (done on a tablet), and were called for our appointment within 5-10 minutes of signing the last document.
Dr. Nadia was very welcoming. She and the dental assistant brought my 3 year old and 11 month old in to the biggest room, I think! There were 4 adults and 2 children in there, with space to spare. My 3yo sat down and the dentist made us all feel comfortable. Started out with a checkup of the teeth, and talked us through the entire experience. Tools that were new or unfamiliar to my 3yo were explained to all of us and the way she did made my 3yo feel a bit more at ease. Dr. Nadia told us what needed to be done with the teeth, even let me check out her mouth so I knew what she was referring to, and went over the x-rays with the angles she was able to capture (on our next visit we'll have to capture the rest since my 3yo wasn't cooperating).

Dr. Nadia checked out my 11 month old's teeth as well! I'm so glad she did because I was not aware that he had a lip tie. He is on bottles/cups now so I don't have to worry. But at least he will be a little less fussy (I hope) at his second visit. Dr. Nadia explained everything so well. Once the visit was over my daughter got a goodie bag. I highly recommend this dentistry and look forward to our next visit.<//review><response>None<//response>< user_id>

We were there yesterday and the hygienist got him to do 4 xrays and clean his teeth, very reluctantly but he did do it! Dr Allen was very nice and great bedside manner. It will definitely take some time for my little to be comfortable but I am sure he eventually will, even after tasting the fluoride and screaming bloody murder and gagging on the fluoride causing him to vomit all over me and the floor of the exam room. Gonna see if there is unflavored cleaning stuff and fluoride next time.....Very nice, clean practice! !< /Review>< Pictures>

I love this dentist. I came here to get a second opinion for my son and I loved the service,  phenomenal service. My son had gone to two different places and was scared out of his mind doing the xrays on the previous spots and he was mortified. We came here and yes he was scared as well but the service they showed him made him feel so at ease that doing his xrays was easy. Cannot express how much I love this place for my son. Love both doctors.< /review>

<text>What a great visit!  We took our 2 year old in for his first visit and what a success (I was really concerned about how he would do)!  We were able to get a Saturday appointment which works so well for our busy schedules and also the fact that we were able to fill out all of the required paperwork online ahead of time impressed me! The office is so inviting, our toddler walked in and felt instantly comfortable!  Loved the toys and the movie playing!
Dr. Allen was so patient and understanding and answered every one of our questions.  He even gave us some great tips on how to make at home brushing easier.  When it was time for the examination itself, our son did barely fussed for Dr. Allen!!
I highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a dentist for their kids!
The staff, the office are both top notch!  We are so lucky to have them so close by!<//text>< Pictures>

As a previous assistant of doctor Nadias, I highly recommend her! She in all honesty is just amazing! I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work by her side for quite some time. She has a calming voice, always reassuring her patients of what exactly it is she is going to be doing. Always explaining in great detail her opinion of the treatment that she recommends to parents.
She is truly one of the best pediatric dentists I have worked with! Most definitely recommend her !</text>

Dr. Allen and the staff at PDofSM are so loving, caring, and fun. They know how to work with my anxious son, my goofy daughter and me (spazzy mom).</review>

A huge weight off my shoulders! We had a ruff time finding a dentist practice I felt good about after we moved to the area and a bad experience at the last one I took my children too. Pediatric Dentistry of San Marcos is so warm and friendly. Tillie at the front desk is over inviting & sweet, Lilia is gentle and creative and even had my kids laughing and the Dr was a great listener and explained in detail. I will highly recommend this dental practice to friends and neighbors!< /review>

This was the second visit for my two years old, and he was a champ. Dr. Bala and all her assistants are excellent. They made him feel so empowered; he enjoyed his Visit the fullest. I absolutely love Dr. Bala. She is so caring and sympathetic. She would make sure you got Good understanding of all the Details. I recommend Dr. Bala to everyone who is looking for dentist For their kids.< /Review>

<name>Lael G</name><Review>Absolutely amazing. The BEST Pediatrics anywhere. My wild boys, do great here, they've got iPads and movies to keep the kids busy. Tilly is fantastic and Dr. Allen and staff are so patient and informative. He actually called to see how our son was doing and they set up multiple treatment plans with price points. I'm just blow away. LOVE this place and so thankful they are here!<//Review><GmapID>0x80dc754f8b282835:0x9f1fa6d59601e65d< /GmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<name>Paul Knipp<//name><Date>1537015091713</Date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Couldn't ask for better care. Dr. Allen explained the entire process in a clear and logical way. He and his entire staff clearly have extensive experience working with children. They describe the instruments like "tooth pillow" instead of dental clamp. I sat back in amazement as my 3 year old was in complete comfort getting a crown put in which included the typical needle/shot and several steps that I thought would trigger a cry or otherwise procedure halting response from my daughter. Much to my surprise Dr. Allen anticipated the rough spots of this procedure and gently walked my daughter through without any problems. He referred to his drill as a "whistle" and the numbing sensation of as her tongue feeling "funny". Truly brilliant, I am so grateful to have found Pediatric Dentistry of SM and have complete trust in my children's well being under their care. Keep up the great work Dr. Allen!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>My daughter was seen at another pedo office last week and the experience was horrible, traumatizing and I felt hopeless to get her taken care of. She is 3 years old and VERY phobic of people and strangers.
From the first phone call with Tilly, to walking out with a smile on my 3 year olds face yelling down the hall "I love the dentist!" this office has been a dream.
They were so patient with her and explained every detail and made it such an enjoyable experience for her. She was holding on to me like a spider monkey when we first walked in and the assistant was beyond amazing with her. Took her time and explained everything in a fun way. Dr Allen was very sweet and also helped me understand what the his findings were and his recommendations.
When I left the office I wanted to stand on the corner with one of those big arrow signs and tell anyone and everyone who has kids to come to this office. You will not be disappointed.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<Text>This is by far the BEST dentist office I have ever been to. Tillie at the front desk will go out of her way to help with scheduling, insurance questions and making you feel at home. The technicians are amazing with kids and so thorough with cleanings and Dr. Bala & Dr. Allen are both extremely caring and professional. My 4, 10 and 12 years olds all love coming to their beautiful office. They can play with iPads in the waiting room and watch movies while in the exam chair. The office is located in a beautiful building that's easy to get to and is exceptionally clean with state of the art equipment. I wish I could take them with us on our move out of state..they are that GREAT!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>For the first time, my son had a great dental visit! He is not fond of going to the dentist, has a difficult time taking x-rays and gets very anxious. Dr Nadia Bala and her assistant, Daisy, were very kind and gentle and made him feel comfortable and relaxed. They were able to take x-rays and give him a complete exam and cleaning with no problem. They really know how to work with children and ease their fear of dentists.
The office was clean, organized and has amazing views of san marcos from every exam room. Dr Bala really took the time to talk to me and my son, she is a caring professional. My son said he really likes this place and does not want to go to any other dentist! So glad we found a qualified, caring dentist close to home. I strongly recommend this office if you have kids.< /review>< Pics>

Daniel N. Was absolutely fantastic and helpful. My elderly father had issues with an app and he graciously helped him troubleshoot and solved the problem within minutes. He truly sets the example of what customer service should look like, as a neighboring T-Mobile  store simply turned my father away. We will only and exclusively deal with Daniel N and that store moving forward for any future purchases. Thank you again to Daniel N for going the extra mile for customers. He didn't have a sale today, but his service earned a lifetime customer. We need more people like him in service industries that are not just about the profit, and more people like Daniel actually MANAGING teams that offer the same level of service. ***** Corporate office — take notice of your top employees like Daniel @ the Nordhoff location  and promote them into impactful positions. *****< /review>

I stopped by at this location for a purchase and everyone was super friendly and helpful. It is not a big store but as far as being helped with what i needed was definitely accomplished with a great costumer service!! And believe me i have had some really bad experiences with other stores before so definitely well deserved 5 stars!< /text>

< Review>
I called in the morning to ask if they had the iPhone 12 in Green in stock and they said no, but they could order it for me over the phone and have it shipped. I said no initially because I wanted to the phone the same day, but decided to just order through them. I called back within 2 hours and the person who I spoke to said “we don’t take orders over the phone call 611 bye” and hung up so rudely. So if you don’t order over the phone for your customers then why did someone from the store offer? Or just pure laziness.<//Review>

This place needs to work on customer service . I came into the store looking to switch. The guy was at the register when I walked in getting ready to put product away. He tells me to wait proceeds to slowly put his stuff away as I wait 5 minutes. That's an easy way to lose a sale.

This was my 2nd visit 2 days in a row. The first day I was there for 20 minutes..no help.< /Text>

Quaint T-Mobile branch. The staff is generally quiet but friendly and knowledgeable. Juan is the man. Be nice to them and they'll be nicer to you. Happy holidays!< /Text>

<Text>Deserve zero stars!! Avoid this store! Not only was the person that helped us extremely rude and inattentive, he was also poorly equipped to diagnose our phone problem. His solution was to send us to Apple because he couldn't figure it out. Apple's solution? Restart the phone. Problem solved. And this isn't the first time we've received poor customer service here<//Text>< gmap_id>

< review>
Bad customer service and especially when they realized that you will use the jump upgrade it's not my first time I experienced such treatment from their staffs. I gave two stars for their items,stocks and cleanliness.< /review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>This store has HORRENDOUS customer service! The staff is NOT knowledgeable about certain services! I had to call T-Mobile customer service while I was at the store for help! The rep was APPALLED at the lack of knowledge at this store and helped me by calling another store to help me instead. He said he would recommend NOT visiting this store again, and that he has made a note about it for corporate.
Wasted 30mins in this ridiculous store and was in the other recommended store for 5-6mins tops without any issues!
I honestly believe they didn’t want to help me because I wasn’t purchasing anything. I was there to turn in an old device for Jump on Demand!<//text>< Pictures>

The clerks here have always been courteous, helpful and professional in their dealings with me. There are two different entrances on two different levels. You might not know this depending on which way you come. The lower level is off of Berkeley directly behind the shopping center. This is where you go to make payments.

The upper level parking lot entrance is off of W. Valley View Drive. Up here the building is U-shaped. The entrance is up the stairs in the middle of the U. This entrance is best if you are appearing in court, going to the self help center or going to the civil clerks office.

If you find yourself on the wrong level there are elevators that can transport you where you need to go.

Like all courts, there is security screening so leave anything that might get you in trouble at home.<//text>

<text>Well, its court so its probably not going to earn a 5 because 95% of the people are here because they are having a bad experience whether it's traffic tickets or civil lawsuits or criminal lawsuits. So I'm just not willing to give it any more. The deputies are usually snotty waiting for a case to take all day. Elections death is usually very helpful however the line to take hours<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

If any of you, is recommended to attend court, then please do. If you do not attend court, then you will get a consequence of paying a fine of $1,000 or jailtime and also your case can be charge with $2,000-10,000. Then, you would have to pay even more including your fine. So, I really recommend attending or letting your lawyer come to your hearing. Make some time to call off out of emergency or urgent matter of attending court due to not get a huge consequence. Also, make sure not to trust the prosecutors, they will lie to you to make a deal with them. Then, once your talking to the judge, then you will get shocked that you only had to pay low but agreed on paying thousands of dollars because the prosecutor said that your minimum fine will be $1,200-3,000 but actually it's just a minimum of $200. So, make sure to get help with your case and understand what could or not happen. Talk with your judge, don't trust a prosecutor, they are not your friend neither your lawyer.

For some of you all, who have a traffic or speeding ticket, please do attend your hearing schedule, you do not want to get a fine for not attending from $5,000-10,000. Even if you parked at the wrong parking space and not attend the court date assigned to you, then you CAN get a fine of $10,000. It is unfair because it was just a mistake but please make sure to read the signs before parking, you never know a cop will check on your vehicle. Their are cops who rather chase after criminals or more important stuffs than that but still please do not make the mistake of doing so. This is a helpful tip. LA County court centers have fair consequence wages from $40-200 but this Orange County, it's more pricey and not a type of justice everyone wants.</review>

<Time>1569901192769</Time><rate>2<//rate><review>Judge was over an hour late to court. No staff communicated with everyone what was going on. A couple people got up to ask the bailiff he was short and dull, barely looked up at them. Everyone in the room was there just to enter their plea for traffic tickets should’ve been a quick and simple process. Judge was nice enough once there, but I find it rude to show up an hour late when you’re paid to be there while everyone there is taking their time out to handle their business like adults and was early or on time. And all the staff just sitting around talking with each other and laughing and we have no clue what is going on. I arrived around 8:10 for 8:30 appointment, judge showed up around 9:45 whole process took 2 hours and there were a lot of others who had to stay after me.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I have been here several times for the self help center because I was doing my own divorce filing. They are very helpful. Unfortunately, when they ask a lawyer or paralegal or whatever to come check your final paperwork, the lawyer gets really bitchy and condescending. But the self help window people are great and kind and understanding.</Review>< user_name>

Another example of the failed justice system.  First, I tried calling them to obtain records.  After 4 tries, I was still unable to talk to a real live person.  Their "call center" is just a series of "informative" scripts; don't be surprised when the information that you are looking for isn't there.  To fulfill the asinine obligations that the court had non-nonchalantly bestowed me with, I had to drive all the way to the North courthouse (I live in South County, and to this day no one knows why my case was not assigned to any of the 4 closer courthouses) and wait in line with all of the other shmucks that fell out of line.  Most of the people that end up in this messy tangle of bureaucracy are not criminals, but normal people that got caught committing "non-violent" crimes.  None of the gate-keepers actually want to help you; in their eyes, you're just a lousy criminal.  The individuals that work at this establishment simply collect exorbitant checks, and hand out relentless penalties in return.  Don't expect justice here; expect continuous punishment.</text>

To talk to a person when calling is not going to happen. The customer service at the court is horrible. They treat you as if you are a criminal. Why is the government so horrible at helping the public. DMV the Court house, undoubtedly the worst customer service ever.< /text>

Well established place with a great selection. Great staff. Great hours for the area. The server had good insight of the dishes. She was able to help us to decide what would be the best option for us and our wallet. Even my 9 year old was happy with the food. Can't say that often. Will be returning next late night with a hunger for something different but familiar.<//review>

Food always great. It is a nice clean place to eat alone and with large parties. It is my seafood lover's favorite place in town. I also want to note that I love the wall murals.</Text>

We have been coming to this location for years now. We love it here. The food is great and so is the service. I can’t name one time that I ever had to wait for anything here, they are so quick and efficient.. Mario helps us out every time!! He is the best.. but I’m rambling now.. I highly recommend this location :)</text>

I paid $30 and some change four tacos of cow's tongue at $9.45 for two and one number two plate. When I got home there was only two tacos and number  two plate when I went over there one of kitchen staff went off on me I asked how could you make a mistake on my order these people are trying to rob me charging me for things they didn't give me and then they get mad and start going psycho I will never go back.

<Review>Food was okay.  Went around 7pm on a weekday and the place was completely empty.  The waiters were good.  You can tell they try. Lots  of menu options. But I probably wouldn't go back, the atmosphere was a little eerie and the food wasn't that great.< /Review><gmapID>0x80db6f56ff42c4cf:0xc9c7833d5d4d755</gmapID><user>105526395679299164671</user><Rating>3</Rating>< time>

<text>Casa Jimenez is in a great place with always friendly staff.  The food, most importantly, is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. They offer yummy Mexican seafood dishes as well as beef, pork, or chicken entrées.  I have tried many items on the menu and have never been disappointed. You can sit in the large comfy booths or at a table, if you prefer. Casa Jimenez also has a nice selection of beer to choose from and soft drinks as well. Give this restaurant a try, if you love Mexican food. Oh, I almost forgot, they also have an All You Can Eat option for those with really big appetites!< /text>< pictures>

Food tastes like it's been sitting and reheated.  We tried a few things too, not just one item or one time.  Our last experience they allowed the bar area to blast the music so loud we could not have any conversation w our friends.   WILL NOT GO BACK< /Text>

I had been going here for over 20 years. I used to love going here until they started treating me strange... I don't know what I did but starting about 2-3 years ago my food started to arrive at my table sloppily arranged on the plate and my micheladas were week and they tasted weird and the glass was never full and they quit giving me that wonderful tajin style rim salt. The worst part is I never used to get sick from this place until they started treating me weird, now whenever I go it's like I have to use the bathroom before I even leave the restaurant. I haven't been there for a couple of years and I don't think I will ever go back! very sad 😥< /review>

I love the chips and Salsa! Had the fajitas it didn't come with the correct amount of tortillas but very tasty. Under staffed for sure but not a very busy location. Definitely a possible hidden gem, I'll have to go back and try more food.<//review>

Plenty of food on the plate and it was good I had the Chile verde burrito dinner plate not a lot of spice to it. Pork was tender and shredded like I like it but it was missing that green chili flavor I love... I will eat there again but will probably pass on this meal next time</review>

<response>None< /response><text>I have not been to a Casa Jimenez in a while. I was out with friends and family. We craved Mexican food so we stopped here in Hemet. My friends and family were from Adelanto so I didn't want to disappoint. We enjoyed every bite! Delicious just like I remember. We also had a few beers (Corona), and they were ice cold as was the soda. We almost didn't stop. Their sign was being fixed, which we didn't know, giving us the impression they were out of business. I'm glad we stopped finding out they were still open! Beef tacos, chicken chimichanga, cheese enchiladas, chili relleno, and more were all very good. This really fixed our craving for Mexican food! Prices have come up since I last visited but still well worth it. I will still be a loyal customer for years to come. I can't say enough about the staff. Attentive, courteous, prompt, and more than one person took care of our table. I hope they stay open for many years to come!<//text>< Pics>

It's definitely a family style casual place.

This truly truly beats everywhere else when it comes to steak tacos. Get number 36! It's 2 steak tacos with pico de gallo decent amount of Spanish rice & decent amount of beans with melted cheese on top. I love to add a little of the red salsa to the rice.

The people there are real. Translation: They're interpersonal.

Ooohh. I could go on an' on 😄😍. 5 stars is not at all enough stars.<//Review>

Upon walking into this place there is a taxidermed deer. It is absolutely majestic. We sat down quick, and i ordered a beer. They brought me two, TWO.
My wife hasn't bitched once since we got here.
Idk what kind of witchcraft this is, but i approve. 5 stars.</text>

<rating>3</rating><Text>I ordered a carnitas taco & pollo taco. Pork was bland, slightly overcooked. Kinda wonder if they just reheated it. Chicken taco was ok. Doused both tacos in salsa to give them some kick. Presentation of the tacos was beautiful though, & they were both still hot when I got them. They also came with chips...also warm & sooo good! Tasted like they were freshly made. Funny, I actually enjoyed the chips more than the tacos. I may try this place again...but won't be ordering tacos if I do.< /Text><UserId.>117988837726726468758< /UserId.><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80db6f56ff42c4cf:0xc9c7833d5d4d755</gmap_id>< Name>

<Date>1527547004184</Date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Total let down. I've been to this Casa Jimenez many times, along with other locations; and this is the first time I've been this disappointed in the food and service. First off, we come here for the all you can eat. Turns out they only do the all you can eat between 1p and 6p. Completely different than other chains. Then trying to read their menu was not easy. Most of the stuff is in Spanish with English translations, which is fine, but it was like one big run on sentence. And between the background color, the font color, and the glare from the lighting it was simply hard to read. My husband ordered the chili Colorado and it was strange. It had a sweet thin sauce, almost like a sweet marinara sauce; instead of the normal thick chili or enchilada sauce that it normally comes with. We've been to this restuarant a few times over the course of the last few years, and were regulars many, many years ago... and this experience was the worst. I'll continue to go to the Perris and Rubidoux locations, but mostly likely won't be back to this location any time in the near or distantly near future.<//review>< pictures>

The chips were excellent,  the red salsa, not at all.  Watery, lack of flavor.  Green salsa, really good.

Ordered the combo plate, chicken taco, chile rellano,  cheese enchilada rice and beans.

The chicken taco was so over cooked that the shredded chicken was dark brown and hard like beef jerky.  The shell was tough, and overall lacked any flavor.

The cheeses enchilada was a soggy mess.

Chile rellano was full of flavor, it's a shame the center was ice cold.

Rice was soggy, too much water during cooking process.  Beans were good, hot and full of flavor, hard to mess up beans.

Wife ordered the same meal and food was exactly the same as mine.

When 3/4s of the food is left on the plate and both people do not ask for to go containers, that should be a huge red flag.

Server didnt ask us about the food.

I've been going here off and on for over 10 years, tried to give them one more chance, I'm done.

Like a dying relationship you try and hope they get better, but in a town known for below average food, a slightly less than average restaurant can seem to be a culinary oasis, when in reality, it's just another slightly below average eatery in below average food town.<//Text>

I sent my husband to buy me a caldo de camaron, I had some work done on my teeth and can't chew very well. My husband was charged $17 for a to go container full of broth, onion, green chile, and 6 pieces of shrimp with the shell and tail still on... I was expecting a whole lot of potato, carrots, celery... NOPE... Overcharged and not worth it. DON'T DO IT!<//Review>

Food wasn't horrible, nothing to brag about but what made it worse was the service. The waitress spilled hot coffee on my baby and instead of apologizing or helping clean the girl just ran away. We had to take a rag from the bus boy to clean my son and it was obvious no one was coming out to take responsibility. If you go with family be very careful cuz it's obvious the staff there are not.<//review>

Good food, usually good service, sometimes business is slow, other times it's busy, been going there for years, started going when I was young and the restaurant was still in San jacinto, the workers are nice and helpful.</Text>

I came here in hopes the food would be good but it wasn't as expected. I ordered their chimichanga plate and they tried handing me a taquito plate. I have no idea how they miss heard that order...but anyways, the food was bland. And their Queso fundido was very dissapointing!! It was just a big blob of cheese with hardly any chorizo and they expected 4 people to enjoy that appetizer with 2 measly flour tortillas and all at the cost of $8.25!!! Will not reccomend this place to anyone! Better off eating at Cardenas market.<//review>

I had the Chilaquiles and was disappointed. The sauce was bland and they were super soggy. The water offered here is the worst I've ever had. It tasted like it came from a moldy sink.< /Review>

Soooooo sub par. The food looked and tasted like there was no effort put into it. We were the only ones in there and they acted like we were interupting theyre conversation they were having loud and angry and in spanish 5 feet from us and couldnt even have our own convo. Then they charged us $40 for a chimichanga and an order of nachos and charged us more for the juice we drank than i would have payed for an imported beer. Can we say racist? Ive gone in w my mexican buddies and was treated right.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Celebrate my wife's birthday there. We disguise it a lot. The excellent food provided plates and forks for the cake that he had brought. They also sang to him and they gave him a dessert. Thank you very much for helping me to make the important day in which my wife was born on a special day.

<Review>(Translated by Google) The street tacos have no meat, they are pure onion and coriander I do not recommend the shrimp cocktail very good, nor do they say anything to the waitress or owner Mirella Jimenez because instead of asking for an apology because the tacos do not have meat, she puts Defend her.

Los street tacos no  tienen carne son pura cebolla y cilantro no se los recomiendo el coctel de camaron muy vueno.ni le digan nada ala mesera o duena mirella Jimenez por que en lugar de pedir una disculpa por que los tacos no tienen carne se pone a la defenciba.</Review><Time>1486064222754</Time><gmap_id>0x80db6f56ff42c4cf:0xc9c7833d5d4d755< /gmap_id>< user>
