1st time training. I just went in to pick up my gi and a class was about to start. I found myself on the mat shortly after I arrived. They're very welcoming and the training was incredible. I can't wait to go back.< /Text>

We all expect Gracie Barra schools around the world to provide high quality customer-service, good professionalism and phenomenal teaching/coaching to their students. This school is the king of kings of Gracie Barra's. They are extremely professional and they truly care about their students. If you ever even consider martial art, this school will change your life. Also, it is important to add something: During a pandemic, they made a way to bring value to their students by following COVID-19 procedures creating a safe environment for their students.</review>

All of the professor make sure they get to know their students and make them feel welcome. My first day they treated me like I had known them for years. The culture that has been created here is something special, it is the most positive group of athletes I have ever spent time around not to mention the level of coaching you receive in any of the classes. This place is so great I got my little brother signed up and he loves it.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dcdd3fa0efb579:0x8822ab762dc49ede< /gmapID></record>

Great place to learn jiu jitsu, for beginners or for advanced practitioners of the sport. My sons love it. Here they are hamming it up a bit. Hard for these two boys to stay serious for two minutes, but at Gracie Barra, they instantly transform into obedient students.< /Review>

I moved from east coast after practicing 4 years in Brooklyn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu school and I looked for a location that can answer my needs, from the first step in it felt almost like being in Brooklyn again, I signed after my first class and although it's my second week I feel like I have been training there for a while, the crew is super nice, and everyone is willing to help< /Text>

Gracie Barra Headquarters is a world class training facility. Philipe Della Monica is one of the best Professors I’ve had the honor of training under. He truly cares for all of his students and gives 100% in teaching them the gentle art. This facility is very clean and gives the students the opportunity to train seven days a week. Grand Master Carlos Gracie Sr. once said “ Think only about the best, work only for the best, and always expect the best”. If you want to be at your best then this is the place.</review>

I’ve been training at Gracie Barra in Irvine for approximately a year and a half.  Before I started training here, I had never done any type of formal martial arts training so walking into the academy on the first day was very intimidating.  On top of my lack of experience with martial arts, I was also in fairly bad shape from a few years in grad school and work.

What I was hoping to get out of training at Gracie Barra was to find an activity that was physically and mentally challenging and something that I would stay with.  I had started and stopped my membership at the gym numerous times and I just found it was too boring and I never pushed myself hard enough.

So in January of 2016 I signed up for a free class and the process was very easy and the ladies at the counter were so friendly that it made it less intimidating.  I signed up right after the intro class and it’s been everything I was looking for.

What I love most about training at Gracie Barra are the world-class instructors (Professors) that truly care about their students and also a plethora of great training partners that make this sport so enjoyable.  There’s truly a fellowship all the members of Gracie Barra and sense of caring for the people we are training with.

I would recommend anyone looking to learn self-defense and stay in shape to first train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and second to train at Gracie Barra.  The last year and a half have exceeded my expectations and I’ve even put my kids as well.  (The kids classes are fantastic)

Thanks to Professors and Staff at Gracie Barra for providing such an excellent school and life changing experience for my family and I.</Text>

Gracie Barra Headquarters is like home.  I have been training at Gracie Barra Headquarters since moving down to Southern California in 2010.  Coming to this school as a blue belt from a different school I was extremely nervous and anxious, but was welcomed with open arms as soon as I walked through the front doors.  The family atmosphere is one of this school’s greatest characteristics along with the excellence of the instructors and staff.

Classes are very well structured and are always filled with practitioners of all ranks and walks of life.  Once on the mats everyone is family and looks to help each other progress and get better.

If you are looking for a new place to train or are looking to being your jiu-jitsu journey, I highly encourage you to come by and try a class yourself.<//review>

I walked through the door 2.5 years ago, signed up that night, and it's one of the best decisions I've made.  If you train Jiu-Jitsu your life will change and for the better.

The staff has unlimited amounts of positive energy and is nothing but supportive.  The curriculum is well thought out and continually improved on.  The guys (and girls) you’re rolling with are world class.  It’s got a great culture: most the students are friendly and everybody seems good natured.

The policies are very flexible. I wanted to take a month off for injury and it was no problem.  The facilities aren’t as posh as an ultra-gym; but that’s not really what I’m there for and I’ve heard that that’s being addressed.  I could not recommend this place more highly.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Best choice for fitness and a must for women of all ages. I was never interested in sports (let alone martial arts). But I gave it a try (first lesson is free) and I loved it. After training for a year or so I was competing in various competitions, including American Open (bronze, gold), Pan Ams (bronze, silver) and World (bronze) and usually always placed in the top 3, which is the best evidence of the quality of this school.  The instructors here are very encouraging, always helpful and genuinely interested in improving your skill.  The curriculum is very well thought out, methodical and consistent.  The schedule is very flexible and allows me to choose a class that is convenient since I am a working professional.  I highly recommend this school to anyone who is interested in fitness, wants to relieve stress after a long day a work or compete at the high level. Gracie Barra Jiu Jitsu is, indeed, for everyone.<//text>< pictures>

I've been Training at Gracie Barra Headquarters for 8 years and it has truly changed my life. Anyone considering Jiujitsu as a sport and a lifestyle should look no further. The Gracie Barra organization offers it all weather you are a kid or a competitor they offer something for everyone,  when you see so many diverse students from so many backgrounds so focused on the same goals it really makes the expirence special! If you just want to loose weight or want to compete at a world class level they will get you there.
Offering  programs for anti bulling, women's classes, kids programs at all ages, to Competition training they can back up their slogan "Jiujitsu is for everyone" please come give it a try first class is always free 😀< /text>

After a long search of different Brazilian Jiu Jitsu schools and being disappointed, someone recommended Gracie Barra. The minute I walked in I was impressed how organized and friendly everyone was. At the time none of the academies I had visited had a curriculum. Gracie Barea was and is the pioneer of establishing structure that all other academies follow. They cater to all types of athletes. If you are looking to get in shape or learn self defense this is the place. Even if you are competitive and want to become world champion one day they will help you achieve it.<//review>

I am a Gracie Barra team member in Texas. I had an opportunity to train at the Gracie Barra Head Quarters in Irvine for 10 days during my trip to to watch the Jiu-Jitsu World Championships. The training there was very technical and classes were usually taught by a Black Belt Professor. One night Master Carlos Gracie jr.  was there teaching a class and it was a threat to share the mats with such a legend of our sport. Everyone was friendly and helpful.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I have been training at this location since 2011 and it's truly a top notch school. All of the instructors are highly professional and the participants treat each other with the utmost respect. The robust training schedule allows a busy professional like myself to choose from classes at all times of the day. My absolute favorite are the noon classes where I take a lunch break from work to train. In addition, I train at other Gracie Barra location when I travel for work and meet amazing people I would otherwise never meet. It's such a great network of schools. If you are thinking of an exercise routine, getting in shape, or competing in a Jiu Jitsu tournament, there's no better place in OC than training at the US headquarters of one of the largest and most organized BJJ schools in the world.</text>< Pictures>

The culture of the school, for the most part, is welcoming to new students.  Higher belts try to help the lower belts through the drills.  In addition, the culture is very family-centric with many parents and kids that compete in local and world tournaments.  The instructors are very technical and provide a pragmatic approach to sport, mma and self-defense.  Any day of the week you will see a numerous higher level belts, including many black belts during the adult classes.  The head instructor, Professor Philipe Della Monica, has an extensive list of fighters that he trains (present and past UFC champions).  His expertise is apparent as he models basic and variations to techniques for different levels within the class.  You will be hard pressed to find a well rounded BJJ school.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>I started learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2015 and I am very glad and fortunate that I am able to train at Gracie Barra Headquarters. It is led by head instructor, 3rd degree black belt Philipe Della Monica, and his knowledge, technical expertise,  positive attitude, and encouragement have made training here a great experience. Learning from high level black belts, such as himself, Jesse, Marco, Rod, Les, and the many, many others that grace Gracie Barra HQ have made me confident in my own abilities to practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. In less than a year of training at HQ I was able to compete and win gold in a regional Jiu Jitsu competition, and I have continued competing in high level Jiu Jitsu competitions, such as the Pans and Worlds tournaments.

I highly recommend trying out Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at Gracie Barra Headquarters. Those who train at HQ run the gamut, from UFC and World Jiu Jitsu Champions, to law enforcement, to the average 9-5 worker (there are classes throughout the day). HQ also offers classes for woman's self defense, children/teens, competitors and beginners. Even if you never plan on competing ( although I recommend it) Gracie Barra Headquarters is a great place to learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Whether it be for recreation, for self defense, or for building one's confidence/self esteem you will definitely have a good time with good people at HQ, challenging yourself and each other in the practice of this great and highly effective martial art.</Text><Resp>None</Resp>< Pics>

Gracie Barra is more than an amazing martial arts academy.  It’s a family.  I have taken classes at Gracie Barra America in both a group setting and private instruction.
All of the Professor, Coaches, and staff are professional, personable, and a positive role model for adults and children.  The Head Professor Phillipe Della Monica is always in a friendly mood and sees good in every situation.  It was my pleasure to introduce my own children to him.  My youngest son has also become one of his students.

My older son has Asperger’s Syndrome and is frightened of many close contact sports.  Phillipe has taken an interest in my son and the special needs application of Jiu Jitsu.

As a father, I very much appreciate Gracie Barra’s children’s program.  It makes our community safer by teaching our young people to defend themselves, but more importantly it develops their character into young adults.  With Schools expelling children involved in physical altercations on a “no tolerance” basis, Jiu Jitsu is a much safer alternative to the “striking” martial arts like Karate or Taekwondo.  Jiu Jitsu’s grappling style appears less aggressive while still being effective.

As a law enforcement professional with more than 23 years of experience, I believe Gracie Barra’s commitment to the community is building the ground work for a better tomorrow.  I have certainly personally benefited in both better physical health and a more proficient hand to hand fighter.<//Text>

The instructors are extremely attentive and friendly with an all time safety first approach.
Professor Phillipe is very detailed an thorough with his classes.
The highest level in Jiujitsu for adults and kids can be found here. In addition, the students and training partners are super nice, welcoming and carefull with each other. The school is extremely clean. And if you stick around after hours you get a peak of the UFC fighters training for their fights which makes it even cooler to be a part of this school! Highly recommend it!!!!</Text>< Pics>

<review>Gracie Barra Headquarters is THE place to train in the Orange County area.  This school is unique by offering world class instruction and a large affiliation of training partners but still maintaining an intimate and supportive learning environment that one would traditionally see in a smaller academy.  The culture here is driven by instructors Philipe Della Monica and Mike Dykes who have helped me since 2008.  Everyone here from high to low ranked belts is interested in helping you grow in your jiu-jitsu endeavors.  Communicating your needs is encouraged from medal chasers to recreational players.  The thoroughness of the school’s curriculum encompasses all areas of the sport including self-defense, sport jiu-jitsu, and MMA.  Techniques are taught in continuation with variations and counters to enable your jiu-jitsu game to flow rather than one confusing mess.  You will be hooked in the long run once you step on the mat here!<//review>< Pics>

So much could be said for this extraordinary establishment. The high level of self defense, anti bullying and authentic Brasilian Jiu Jitsu, taught from master Carlos Gracie Jr himself is almost a perk to everything that goes on within those four walls. From toddlers of just 3 years of age to men 72 years young, active competitors and UFC fighters alike and it doesn't stop there..  your favorite soccer mom looking for a mid week work out or your busy business professional that has an hour a day at lunch and is looking to practice the gentle art..Gracie Barra HQ has it all.

Never have I experienced a martial arts academy with such humble roots where everyone leaves their egos at the door and walks in with a smile. I am incredibly impressed with the facility, its instructors, the cleanliness and most importantly the consistency of passion and commitment for which the classes are taught. Its rare to find a martial arts school with such a large network of schools there is even curriculums that are available to reference that change based on belt level and programs.

Thank you Gracie Barra and thank you to all the students turned friends and family for creating such an outstanding place where all are welcomed and appreciated for our contributions to community, each other and the art of Brasilian Jiu Jitsu . Its funny but sometimes I feel as if a day not spent training, is a day not maximized to its fullest potential.

I highly encourage anyone that has never been to GBHQ before to go by, have a look or even watch/ try a class but most importantly notice the smile on the face of yourself or your loved one when you realized that you have just found your third place.</text>< user_id>

<Review>This place is an absolute treasure!  The instruction for kids and adults is outstanding for both self-defense and sport jiu-jitsu.  My son has been training since he was four years old, I started shortly after him, and it was one of the best decisions of our lives.  Gracie Barra Headquarters (Irvine) is special because you not only get the best instruction but you will also meet outstanding people.  The head instructor is Professor Philippe Della Monica who’s an extremely accomplished BJJ athlete and instructor, but his accomplishments pale in comparison to his character and investment in his students.  His personality and character set the tone for the entire academy, as you will find instructors that are very invested in the development of you and your children.  It doesn’t matter if you are a UFC champion, Jiu-jitsu champion, or student who’s seeking a healthy lifestyle, Professor Philippe will be equally invested in you -- I’ve seen and personally experienced his devotion and investment for all his students regardless of expertise level.
At GBHQ, you will find a training culture that doesn’t look to grind and beat you up but one that seeks to help you with a life long journey within the art leading to a healthy life.  Because this GB location serves as the world headquarters for the GB organization you get the chance to meet and train with hall of fame BJJ athletes and legends within the art.  I can’t say enough about this place but try it out yourself and you can experience a life changing art, academy, and culture.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcdd3fa0efb579:0x8822ab762dc49ede</gmap_id></record>

I have so many great things to say about Gracie Barra Irvine that I honestly don't know where to begin. I will start by saying that this is a world class facility with world class instructors in terms of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I have been practicing "the gentle art" on and off through out the past 16 years and have had the opportunity to view & participate at different gyms/facilities. I have yet to come across a BJJ academy that is as diverse and well rounded as Gracie Barra Irvine.

Head instructor professor Philipe De La Monica has the academy running like a well oiled machine. The curriculum that he provides caters to many body types, level of athleticism, and age groups. The academy also caters to those that are interested in the sport for competition as well as those who are interested in the sport for other reasons (fitness, self defense, etc.). What I like most about Gracie Barra Irvine is the friendly atmosphere and lack of ego's. I have been to gyms where the sole focus is sport jiu-jitsu and many sparing partners have malicious intent. It is rare that this happens at Gracie Barra Irvine, there is a certain level of respect for each other as well as consideration for the safety/well being of training partners.

If you have been on the fence about trying Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I urge you to not waste another minute and come try a class at Gracie Barra Irvine. You won't be disappointed.< /Review>

I've been training here since 2009 and have had a great experience. The Gracie Barra motto is "Jiu-Jitsu for Everyone" and there is something for everyone here. I strongly encourage you to come by the academy and see for yourself, but if you need the information:

BEGINNERS / CASUAL BJJ PRACTITIONERS: If you're just starting, they always make you feel welcome here. Some of the best people I've ever met are from here at Gracie Barra HQ.

SERIOUS COMPETITORS: If you're a serious competitor, there is never a shortage of talent. In the advanced and black belt classes, there are so many tough training partners. Even during the lunch time classes, there are a lot of brown and purple belts to test yourself.

KIDS: Brearin is one of the best in the business when it comes to teaching the kids. He has a lot of energy and knows how to have fun, but he is good at keeping he kids focused on learning. Coach Rod is also awesome with the kids too. The curriculum itself is not just BJJ centric and teaches kids different life lessons as well.

WOMEN: Women are always welcome in the regular classes, but they also have a women's program that is geared towards different aspects of BJJ.

TRAVELERS: When you sign up at one Gracie Barra, you can go to any of them worldwide. That way, you have no excuse not to train! There are a lot in the SoCal area alone and it's also a good way to make sure you train with other people you're not familiar with and don't get too familiar with the same people.

OTHER NOTES:

Over the years, there have been so many great instructors. More recently, Professor Philipe Della Monica has taken over as the head instructor and has continued to grow ever since. He is very well respected in the BJJ and MMA community as a competitor and coach. He is super friendly, but what stands out is his passion for teaching and his professionalism. He runs the school meticulously and even when he travels to teach seminars or corner MMA fighters, he is always back as soon as possible to teach. We are lucky to have him.

The point is that they're always working to improve the BJJ experience for you and you can't ask for anything more out of a BJJ school or any organization for that matter.< /Review>

After trying out a few BJJ schools in Orange County to find a school for my son in 2012, I was totally impressed with the Gracie Barra schools (visited GB Saddleback at the time).  I specially noticed that there was a curriculum, format and a professional approach in the way it was taught.   Since then, I also started to train, but now I am in GB Headquarters in Irvine.  I am almost 48 years old, but training there makes me feel like I am in my 20s again.  I also want to mention that I am really passionate about Gracie Barra because of the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and most of all the camaraderie everyone experiences there.  I know that I can speak for everyone when I say that we have all gained an awesome “family” in Gracie Barra! Thank you professor Philipe for your Leadership, Passion, Inspiration and for “fanning the fire” for all of us to master the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.< /Text>

<UserId.>111837054160486645883< /UserId.><review>My son and I joined Gracie Barra 3 years ago. I am 56 years old and my son just turned 16 years old. The Gracie Barra experience has been one of the best things I have done in my life. I am athletic and have done a lot of sports. Never have I found such nice and positive people. The whole experience is positive. It is very difficult to find anyone I dislike. Professor Philipe Della Monica leads by being a great instructor and a role model for kids, parents, students and peers. All the instructors are top notch with not only their Jui Jitsu knowledge, but also their positive attitude. Some of the best Jui Jitsu  and UFC athletes come to the academy/studio. They are all very nice and treat everyone in the studio very respectfully and as equals. My son started in the kids' program. About 5 months ago, he started doing the adult classes. It has been such an amazing experience for him. The adults and higher belts are extremely nice and serve as additional role models to my son. They come from all walks of life, yet have the same things in common: nice, positive, hardworking, family oriented. I cannot think of a better experience for young men and women to be surrounded by top notch adults. Finally, as a 56 year old man, it can be quite intimidating competing and wrestling against younger men and knowing that your best days physically are behind you. Thank you to my training partners and instructors for understanding the challenges faced by us older guys.  Philipe and the other instructors do a great job in not letting my Ego get in the way of learning the Gentle Art. I feel I am in great mental, physical and spiritual health. My son and I are certainly better people by joining Gracie Barra Jui Jitsu.<//review>< Response>

The most important testimony I can give about this school and what sets it apart from every other academy is it's super-refined structure and consistency.  The leadership and world-class instructors maintain an extremely positive and light-hearted attitude, which provides a fun & ideal learning environment.

Grace Barra Headquarters, in my opinion, is the best place to learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in the world.  I've trained here for just over 8 years now (white belt to black belt) and I can't say enough about my experience!

I took my first intro class in April of 2008 and was instantly sold on the team spirit, positive attitudes, and clear/concise instruction.  No lie.. I signed up and paid for an entire year in advance.  I even told myself on that first day that I would become a black belt at this school.  When it's right, I guess you just know.  I'm now one of the dozens of black belts at the school attending classes regularly.

If you are looking for world class Brazilian Jiu Jitsu instruction taught by world class black belts in a fun and safe environment.. this is the school for you.  Come take a class and I promise you'll be hooked.</review>< Pictures>

Led by world champion, Professor Philipe Della Monica, the Academy is open seven days a week offering classes for young children (boys and girls), ages 4 and up through adults (men and women).

My son, Mason, who is 16, and I have been training there for over 6 years now (I am 64) and what we have both gained and learned over that time is not only the technical and fighting aspect of Jiu Jitsu but also lessons in perseverance, respect, putting in hard work to get better and being a better person in every aspect of life.

The level of training and competition, led by the Professors and Coaches teaching the classes, is high and there are often three, four or more Black Belts training with you in an adult evening class.  Many of them are also competitive Jiu Jitsu world champions and participants!

If you want to participate in a sport that will test your mental and physical ability, your toughness and get you in the best shape and condition in your life and also build new, long lasting friendships, you might just want to come over and take a class and see for yourself.

That is because you will literally receive instruction from Champion Brazillian Jiu Jitsu practitioners.  From in-house instructors to visiting instructors, you'll have access to the minds of some of the most prominent jiu jitsu players in the history of the sport.  It is important to note that this is not only reserved for the hard-core competitor , but to women, children, and the most casual practitioner of the "gentle art".  Speaking of children, the Little Champs and Junior programs are the best out there.  I've seen a transformation in my own children that I can only attribute to jiu jitsu.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The place to be for the best BJJ instructions. Either for simply learning BJJ or planning to join the competition world of BJJ. I also noticed they have the best instructors for the children classes. Prof. Brearin and Coach Rod inspire the kids to be their best inside or outside the mats. Also now, Prof. Feitosa and Master Carlos Gracie Jr. (son of the founder of BJJ himself) are now in charge of managing the place who stresses major foundations for each students in the art and in the sport. You can't go wrong with that.< /Text>

This school is an amazing beacon for all of the Gracie Barra schools all over the U.S. and the world!  It is the academy where I started my instruction to teach in the U.S.  The program was tough and disciplined.  The people were also.  It helped make me stronger and better in my game and in my technique as well as perfect my ability to deliver our messages to my students.  Jiu-Jitsu is not just a sport or hobby.  It is life changing.  It is life altering.  If you let it take over you will go places you always dreamed and always hoped you would be.  This is what I learned and what I cherish from my time at GB Irvine.  The bond of a family forever united by the incredible teachings of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, from Professors such as: our Master Carlos Gracie Jr., Professor Marcio Feitosa, Professor Flavio Almeida, Professor Marco Joca,  Professor Kayron Gracie and much more.
Tough guys full of heart and passion for a sport they know could change the world.

<Text>I'll start by admitting that I've only started training here very recently, so these are more of my initial impressions. I'll probably provide an updated review in a few months.

The tagline for the GB franchise is "Jiu-Jitsu for Everyone", and that describes the atmosphere at GB Headquarters perfectly in that it is excellent at accommodating people with different goals for learning BJJ. Some people are doing it for fitness, others for self defense (like me), others for competition and MMA training, and so on. The students are also of all different shapes, sizes, and levels of athleticism as well.   Regardless of those factors, all of them are meeting their goals through learning the art of BJJ. The instructors have a base of expertise that is diverse enough to answer questions and tailor their teaching to accommodate these different perspectives and aims.

Everyone I've come across is friendly and willing to help, and I have not encountered any egos in the other students as of this writing. The instructors are also patient at breaking down moves and principles, answering questions, and teaching at a pace where beginners like myself can pick it up. Great atmosphere for a beginner like me - who is small, not very flexible, fairly uncoordinated, and pretty out of shape.

I've had classes with about 5 different instructors so far. The curriculum each week is standardized, so the techniques/principles that are taught are the same but each instructor has a slightly different teaching style where they emphasize different points about the same set of moves. I personally like this, as it allows a student to learn a technique not only by its steps, but by its principles and options for when and when not to apply them.

A final positive is that they don't have long-term contracts like other gyms, so if something happens such that you're unable to train, you won't be locked in. That was a deciding factor for me signing up here, since I'm a student.

In short, I highly recommend it so far, especially to beginners regardless of their goals or level of athleticism.

Check back in a few months for an update.</Text>< pics>

This place is horrible!!!! They lock you in with a fraudulent contract, keep charging you even when you cancel. They upgrade your membership to up to 200 dollars a month without telling you. And they lie to you saying that they can cancel the membership. They tell you it's not them it's their billing company, well, comes to find out after month of research, the billing company is them. It's actually ran by one of their black belt, a guy named Derrek Nakagawa, and they have a small office right here in Irvine.
A bunch of liars and crooks. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.< /text>

Cute little spot that looks to have a great inside/outside bar atmosphere. I went for taco Tuesday and the ordering process was a little rough... possibly due to Covid. There were only three meat options...tacos were good but small.<//review>

The Salt Pepper Fish was heavily battered and had very little fish.  What you eat is mostly fried batter.  Most Salt Pepper Fish is prepared with very light coating and you can clearly see and taste the fish so this was a big disappointment.  The Soy Sauce Chicken was the saving grace as the Salted Fish with Chicken & Tofu wasn't great either.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dbf8ebcd03a1ab:0x6801d958fdb3e475< /GmapID></record>

Solid food at a great quality:quantity:price point, especially for lunch specials ($8-10).  Service was friendly and attentive. Don't go here for decor--it's in a space adjacent to a supermarket.  I think comparable to Sam Woo (which might be a tad better) but they take credit cards (unlike cash-only Sam Woo), it's not as crazy busy, and thus service seem less gruff.  Thank s will be our preferred go-to place when we just want solid Cantonese fare with out the fanfare/ambiance.</text>

Came for dim sum, they have limited selections but all food tasted great. Will definitely come back to order different dishes!

One con is that they don't have AC. I happened to go on a hot summer day. Guess it won't be a big problem for San Diego on a normal day.<//review>

This place is in a grocery store.  The dim sum su Mai was fresh, but lacked flavor.
The baked charsui bao was  soft, freshly made and delicious but was short on filling. Chicken feet was flavorful but semi tough.  The beef chow funny was excellent perfect blend of soyu, beef, sprouts, ginger, sugar and fun rice noodles. I was visiting the area. And this place was the closest.
I would venture to say there may be other options, but in a pinch this would suffice. Pricing is moderate. Aloha< /Text>

I frequent this special place from time to time since I enjoy the good mood that is unique to this place. The staff is extraordianrillyremarkably welcoming and qualified. The service is pretty efficient. Not to mention, the food you get is highly distinguished. I came often and I was never disappointed. The expense is decent. I highly suggest this restaurant to all my friends.</Review>

<Review>It's an average looking food court kind of kiosk inside of a grocery store. However, they do make some nice dim sum and some excellent rice porridge, both of which exceeded expectations.

We got siu mai (pork and shrimp), har gao (shrimp dumplings), xiao lum bao (soup dumplings), baked BBQ bao, Magic Rice Wrapped (sticky rice with chicken), and egg rolls. The egg rolls were average, but everything else ranged from very good to excellent. The pork porridge with preserved eggs in particular is really well done, very well seasoned, and the pork in it is so tender It's hard to believe. We will definitely be back for more!<//Review>< pictures>

This place is awesome if Ur looking for authentic szechan food, not for white people, u guys go to brandy hos.Their spicy good is made from real chilies from China not from pre-made sauces.This place also does not use msg per owners preferences. Next time ur looking to try something new and refreshing go to Hong Kong BBQ & Dimsum, it's the da bomb<//Review>

<text>This Asian restaurant is attached to the grocery store so it convenient to get some groceries and food to go or sit in to eat. It has a rather formal dining area.  However I came for the Peking duck at the to go counter. The Peking duck can be seen through a glass stand with lots of Peking ducks, soy sauce chickens and crispy pork are hung. There you can also order all kinds of Chinese food which they will prepare fresh for you to go. A small selection of dim sum is already made fresh on display.</text>< pictures>

Came here to buy some roasted pork for the Lunar NewYear.  We ended upp with 2+ pounds of roast pork, 1/2 of a chicken, and 2 orders of fa gao (a light sponge cake).

Service:  good.   Server was nice to tell me  about the choicess of chicken.  Knowing that I was buying food to  celebrate the lunar new year, she told  me about a celebration in the  nearby public library.  Was smiling all the time when we  carried a conversation.

Food:  surprisingly good quality!!! The skin of the roasted pork was crispy.   The meat  was seasoned with the right amount of salt and spices.  Each piece was cut perfectly and assembled nicely in the box, see picture.   I sometimes get my roasted pork  from a store in Clairemont Mesa.   This place has  better  service and quality!  The sponge cake has good texture and not so sweet.

Like this place and will visit again for bbq takeouts.</text>

If you look for this,  it is inside the grocery store!  That was a pain to find we almost gave up!  We had Peking Duck served two courses.  The bao with crispy skin was soft and sweet, never enough of it for us!  The second was a lettuce wrap succulent meat and chestnuts.  It hit the spot for sure!</Text>

This is a very low key, minimalist dim sum / Chinese food restaurant attached to an Asian market. They have a VERY small selection of dim sum and a better selection of Chinese food items. Service staff was nice, but that forgot our orders a lot. Overall, pretty fun, inexpensive joint for Chinese food.<//Text>

I decided to give Hong Kong BBQ and Dimsum a try. Although, the arrangement is a bit strange, it was nice and clean. Food was not bad at all. However, dim sum options are very very limited. I had shumai, spare ribs, and rice soup. I was happy with my orders. I would rate it 3.7 stars.< /Review>

My husband and i go here all the time. I introduced him to the duck porridge and he can't get enough of it. The fried flounder is one thing that i always order and it never fails me. Love coming to this place.< /Text>

Went here for dimsum on a Sunday, and it's just really not very good.

Most of the items were already pre-made and just waiting to be plated, which really didn't do them any favors. The 叉烧包 were simultaneously dry and a soggy mess.

The only items that were decent were those that we got lucky with and they had to make fresh. We got the 鳯爪 this way and they were well-flavored and actually pretty good. Similarly, the 虾饺 while not superb were at least okay.

The decor is really poor, even by Chinese restaurant standards. It's a converted movie theater that shares the interior with a supermarket, and it looks like a converted movie theater, only with a bit of an unpleasant smell.

The service is also really poor, even by Chinese restaurant standards. There weren't a huge number of people there, but the wait staff still took ages to come by or do anything.< /Text>

我建議不要order小籠包。小籠包的味道是糟糕的。但是我推薦蝦餃皇。我忘記這是什麼。只記得有special 的單詞。也許你在一開始享用這個面時會覺得很好吃，但是當我吃完一半后我覺得膩。因此我不建議一個人吃它。至少應該是兩個人。</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dbf8ebcd03a1ab:0x6801d958fdb3e475</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Best BBQ period.  Bonnie B never disappoints.  Soft, juicy, melts in your mouth awesome.  Candied yam, potato salad, and 5 pieces of ribs does the trick every time.  Mouth watering as I'm writing this.<//Review>

<Review>The best Soul Food/BBQ spot in Pasadena. The Mac n Cheese and Yams are simply to die for. The brisket, hot links, and of course the ribs are bomb!!! My personal favorite is the Salmon, hefty portion and absolutely succulent. I try to grab a plate at least once a week, and this was my staple for Sunday Night Football if I wasn't cooking myself. You definitely gotta try Bonnie's out! You'll become a regular!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Southern home cooking: black eyed peas, okra, collard greens. I had the pork ribs, which are generous in size, smokey, & tender. We paid a small upcharge for corn bread instead of sliced white bread. Excellent value & good eating.< /Review>

Pleasantly surprised!! This place was pretty good. I'm using disappointed in trying soul food or any black owned food businesses in california being that I'm from the south. I'm so happy I stopped by this place today! The sweet potatoes were so delicious and the peach cobbler!! Chicken was so tender it was falling off the bone. I will definitely be back.<//review>

< Review>
I haven't even tasted the food yet, and I'm unhappy. I ordered, paid, and sat down 15 feet from the register. While I waited another customer came in, gave his name, picked up his order and left. The woman who served me went on a break or something and, after 10 or 15 minutes, another woman asked me what my order was. I told her, she asked me my name, and then she brought a bag. She said it had been sitting back there for 10 minutes, getting cold, I suppose. No one ever called my name. This was my first visit, and I'm not sure I'll be back. They don't  their act together. I left a tip when I paid and now I regret it.< /Review>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Ribs and Collard Greens are very well made. Ribs carry the smoky flavor from the barbecue, and is juicy and soft (probably due to the low temperature in this special barbecue pit and so the meat juice wasn't evaporated off?).  Friendly service. Family-run small business.</Text>< name>

Love this place. I had the brisket with Mac and cheese and yams. And peach cobbler for lunch.
So disappointed that I didn’t make it back for dinner, but you can bet I’ll be back there again at some point tomorrow. It’s just that dang good.< /review>

<Review>This place is amazing. Really wasn't sure going in given the small store front and the area but boy am I glad I did. The woman at the cashier was super friendly and helpful. I sat down and my food was out in about 5 minutes. The fall off the bone spare ribs were just that so tender but not dry. The collards were perfect not bitter or overdone. I will definitely be making this a regular place from now on.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The meats {ribs & brisket) were good, the sides not so much. Slow getting the food out. Some mix-up with the order. Had to explain my order many times before I got my food.</review>

It says open on website, Thursdays 3:PM I keep calling to place an order and know in is picking up and it says inbox full, so I cant even leave a message. I always try to eat here put they seemed closed half the time. The one time there are open they dont pick up the phone. Reason why I wana place the order a head of time is because they take for ever. WOW I could have gave you so much business, you are NEVER OPEN 👎🏼 bbq is okay btw</Review>

I ordered thru GrubHub and my driver rude and obnoxious,  unpleasant experience, never want him to handle my food again. Poor customer service and very bad attitude like he hates his job. My food was raw and uncooked, my meat was very pink amd tough. I feel its a safety hazard to serve someone raw pork meat or any meat at that. This was truly a dissatisfaction all around. Fighting with my meat to separate from bone is unusual and meat was possibly bleeding.</Review>

<name>R Lucero< /name><rating>1<//rating><review>--> HERE's SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT <--

Placed an order only to witness with my very own eyes. The person handling the cash "without gloves" goes over and starts touching the food. I immediately asked for my money back. How is this at all safe?! The person handling the cash should be wearing gloves and should not be touching the food at all! Absolutely disgusting especially during these crazy covid times. If you want to risk your health and safety for a mediocre plate of food then be my guest. I personally would recommend going else where. Obviously they are not worried about the well-being of their customers or themselves.</review>< pics>

This is the kind of Mexican taco truck you should expect in Oakland...but in Fremont. Affordable, super tasty, fast. And, they have dining tables and umbrellas to chow down and relax under. Perfect meal in the great outdoors. Plenty of parking. Just make sure you bring cash!</review>

Overpriced, didnt even get any onions cilantro or sauce on my tacos. I have a feeling they might charge ya for it. And the al pastor was salty. There are better more reasonably priced taco trucks in the area. Will not be going back.<//text>

So this review is for the Taco Truck that sits on Thornton...more like trailer but you get the point. Been here 2 times already and both times there is a small line. No matter, the guys inside are really fast, friendly and make great food. We have ordered tacos, nachos and quesadilla. Nacho and quesadilla were good, the tacos were bomb!! Got Al pastor, carne asada, chicaron, and chicken; all were fantastic. My new favorite taco truck in Fremont!< /Text>

<user_id>105262661519560790951< /user_id><Review>(Translated by Google) In my opinion, the food was very good, although I only ordered triplet tacos, these were very good and with a very good taste and although they have sauce to put them I did not want to put them because they were already very tasty. Well, I recommend the place to eat since it is economical and although it is a lunchbox they have very good service and good food.

En mi opinión se me hiso muy buena la comida aunque solo pedí tacos de tripita estos estaban muy buenos y con muy buen sabor y aunque tienen salsa  para ponerles no les quise poner por qué así ya estaban muy sabrosos.

Worth checking out.
Smooth ramps. I believe this was made by Spohn Ranch.
It's Well made.
It's got quarter pipes on each side, with A frames and rails and a gap in the middle.
Street parking.
There are bathrooms there.
I believe the bathrooms and the Skate spot itself may be closed to the public right now?
Not sure about the hours or if it is open.
It was chained up before.
Anyway, neat little Park.
Worth checking out.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

This park is small and quaint it does have a couple of different play areas, basketball court and a skateboard park also has  restrooms and water fountain. There's also a water play area but it is currently closed this year because of the virus also it's not the season but kids can still play in that area.. there's no parking lot there's only street parking and it is in a residential area it is a clean Park.<//text>

The salads are so fresh, so big, reasonably priced, and you get friendly service at the front. I have not tried the sandwiches but I’ve read they are good and it seems to be really busy there with to-go orders so that’s a good sign.< /Text>< Pics>

Salads are fresh and made when you order. Cashier is very friendly and eager to answer your questions. Very healthy options and way delicious! The downside is that they close very early, they should consider closing at least at 8pm.<//text>

Expect roughly around 10-15min the most for your food, not as bad as 1hr at kotori 😂.It’s definitely a must go place!! Ps. Closed on weekends :(< /text>< Pics>

<Review>The BF wanted to sell his Magic the Gathering cards, but we came on a Monday and the person who buys the cards only comes on Saturdays. The store is pretty small but it filled to the brim with merchandise. There were some kids hanging around playing card games and the store owner seemed nice. There is plenty of parking but no restrooms.</Review>< pics>

This place is great to get any tcg cards. Though the only downside is that the place seems a little compact and messy. Other than that the owner was friendly and had a great time trying to get some cards.</text>

<Text>We walked in there and stood around for a few minutes and no one came out to ask if we needed help or anything. The store was pretty dirty and inventory was limited. It was definitely not worth our time to visit this place.< /Text>< Pictures>

Really nice owner, and really good pricing on Yugioh booster boxes and structure decks. It's a bit small, but there's plenty of nice, inexpensive single cards available. Also a really amazing dog.
Update: I've mostly stopped playing Yugioh due to a lack of time to, but I visit every once in a while to buy model kits. I've noticed that there have been a lot more people coming to Yugioh tournaments, so if you're interested in tourneys, you should totally come!< /review>

I thought the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I did walk in at 1st and there was no one there, but I called "Hello?" and right away a smiling staff member appeared.  I'm just learning about pokemon cards, because my son is newly interested.  They took 10 mins and explained the differences in EX, GX, break, and all the confusing packs.  Even gave me a free guide to help explain a few things.  They even TEACH kids to play the pokemon card game for free, just call in and set up a time.  The prices are on par with other places and the internet.  I think it's worth a look for sure.< /Text>

I think there may be new owners or managers, and they are awesome. The food is great and the people are friendly and always happy to see you when you come for an order. My favorite Chinese food in town now. Try the boneless fried chicken. Flipping. Amazing.</Review>

<review>We have been regulars here for the past few years. We absolutely love it. Everything on their menu is delicious and fresh. I do recommend ordering a lunch or dinner plate so you have soup of the day and little bit of everything. It is very well priced, my fiancé and I each order our own plate and we never pay more than $21 total. I recommend any of their delicious shrimp dishes😋< /review>< response>

The women up front is kind and warm and wants to make sure your happy and have everything you need, like a southern grandma. The food is also amazing, but even if it was mediocre (which it is not) I would still come because of the incredible service.< /review>< pictures>

Very unfortunate, I had forgotten why I quite going to this restaurant and tonight it all came back.  I phoned in the order and was told 20 min. I arrived at that time, the restaurant had three booths with a total of 8 people.  There was one to go order customer in front of me. One of the customers in the booth had been requesting a straw and even though she acknowledged his request she never took him a straw.  After the guest made a scene another guest walked over with an extra straw to the man in need.  The owner/waitress only excuse was, it's only me.  Four ladies came in and set down. Then the to go customer got her food, the other customer in the booth went to pay while my food was sitting ready to take.  This guy kept trying and trying but the card wouldn't go through after 5 tries he brings his wife over to also try.  My food has been sitting now for 10 min.  The wife finally brings out her card.  I then asked the owner/waitress, since I was paying cash can you just tell me what I own so I can leave?  She didn't want to leave the counter where the failed attempts kept happening. Nor could she just look at my tag and tell me what I owed.  I had to wait until the transaction with the customer whose cards would not work was complete before I could be told my total. "$31.80" finally she told me.  I dropped 32 and grabbed the box.  Now the four ladies sitting in the booth haven't even got their menus and they have sat their for 15 minutes.  I was surprised that the decor from Maria's Italian Specialty were still on the walls.  That was at least 20 years ago.  Yea that brought back memories of why I quit going to Ming Sing.  When I got the food home there was nothing special and the crab wantons, egg rolls and chicken were all fried super hard.</Text>

<Text>Food is really good.  I had a happy family dish , and it is awesome.
Would give a five star but customer service it's terrible the owner runs the front but she has no manners at all.  She needs BIG TRAINING  on how to host a customer.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I went there for lunch and the food was HORRIBLE! I don't know how this place has so many stars. People should raise their standards. I will NEVER go back there. The fried rice was left on our plates because it was absolutely inedible. The chicken was over cooked. The shrimp was so overcooked it was chewy. The cornstarch water they served us is called "soup"? Really? How is this place keeping their doors open for business? I gave a good tip and was polite, but never ever again.<//Review>< pictures>

My go to Chinese restaurant in Lodi. Prices are competitive and service is quick. I would order the dinner for two and the prices are competitive that you get an appetizer,soup and 2 vian and fried rice. They have a ton of customers and they are very busy. The phone keeps ringing for orders.<//text>

Only reason I give 3 stars was for service. Mongolian beef combo plate...Tasty and filling. But had to ask for water, got sat with no menu. I was one of 3 tables. I am in the industry and expect a lot I guess..But the basics were barely met. But great food....</Review>

We used to Go to Southern Gold, who were excellent and 1/2 The price of  Ming Sing; but now that Southern Gold closed, Ming Sing us back to being #1. The Singapore Rice Noodles are delicious, and we also love the Shrimp Chow Fun, the Curry Chicken and the Wor Won Ton Soup. And of course their Honey Walnut Prawns are the best in the Central Valley!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

But the staff is nice and helpful and the food is great. The mongolian beef is the best in town! Every time I go I get it.

VERY VERY VERY rude phone lady. Started ordering garlic chicken, egg rolls and a drink for the first order  and she started yelling that it is $25 minimum for delivery when I was ording each meal seperate. I never leave reviews but this really rubbed me the wrong way, I ended up spending $64. They ended up putting shrimp in one of the fried rices and did not give us the second order of eggrolls, refused to drive back out because they insisted it was in the bag. Food is great but make sure you are ready to deal with horrible customer service.<//Text>

Terrible food, overpriced and definitely not worth checking out. Just threw out our generals chicken and hot and sour soup we picked up to go. 97% sure I just attempted to eat someone’s pet. Hopefully dine in is better, but If you don’t like overpaying for microwaved “chicken” then stay away.< /Text>

The staff is great and the food is pretty decent. There isn't anything that necessarily sets it apart from other asian places. The decor is a little confusing but that isn't too big a deal.</Review>

Had dinner with my daughter and was greeted by an extremely rude older lady..when it was time to order she actually rolled her eyes in disgust at us.If the restaurant wants more business they need to either get rid of her or show her how to be NICER to people..I would give her a half a star rating!!<//text>

I'll be honest, this was my first time visiting, and I tend to need a few visits to get a feel for the place. But here is my preliminary thoughts.

The line was surprisingly fast for how busy it was. The lady at the window was polite and professional. She answered my 1 questions kindly. Received my food pipping hot as well, considering it was past 2am when I stopped by. I think it's worth a late night stop.< /Review>

<Text>Yet another prejudice establishment focused on keeping the homeless out of the area. Probably one of the only restaurants not taking ebt as every other of the same name will. Seems they hire employees and management only if they have a holier than thou attitude towards the less fortunate. Notice the prices oftheir burgers are at least a whole dollar more than the two closest Jack's. And they always mess up online orders. Even the simplest meals can be drama.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Horrible management. The manager here, i think her name is Vanessa, is very unprofessional and mistreats her employees! The other leaders there, who look new also have poor customer service. They do not know how to handle certain situations. They look at people with nasty looks. And go to the back and gossip about people. While the store is full of customers. I noticed one lead, name is Priscilla, is always in such a bad mood every single time I have gone in. Her and another employee seem to always gang up and gossip about another worker there, who I noticed ALWAYS performs her job perfectly. I don’t know what kind of store this is or how they run things here but I personally work in the food service and I wouldn’t allow such nonsense to take place in my place of work. Corporate get your MANAGERS in check!! I will start calling and making complaints every day if I have to if this store does not get under control.< /Text>

<text>06/02/20 at 4:00am ish, we got greeted at the speaker with "our system is restarting"
OK. We get it. It's fine, so we waited. Then we asked how long it will be after waiting for 5 minutes and she went,"15 to 30 minutes"... Uhm. Why didn't you say that before?

A lot of the time the lady Rena/Raina i think her name is does an amazing job.

The guy working 3AM 11/27/2020 was a jackass. All I got was a small coke and 5 nuggets. Why throw the bag at me?</text><Date>1606499678656< /Date>< Pics>

Easy to see from road. Drive through is quick - less than 5 minutes with 3 cars in front of me. The order was correct, hot and fresh. Drive through staff was pleasant and efficient. Condiments and napkins provided without the asking. One of the better drive throughs I've been to.<//review>

The worst experience ever!!! Drive through girl taking order wile laughing and playing around with I don’t know who. Got my order wrong, forgot some curly fries that was even ordered at the end and got charged too!!! Wow they don’t know what they are doing and bad customer service. This happens today Saturday 1st of March 2020 at around 1:00pm. I have been a customer services for 20 years and never had wrote a bad review but I had to write something if you want to succeed in life you need to have great customer service. Now that I have read some reviews it’s embarrassing that nothing has changed at all!!!< /Review>

<Review>Google how Jack in the box sickened and killed people...please do your research before eating at certain places Ultimately, 73 different Jack in the Box locations were linked to the E. coli outbreak. The bacteria sickened over 700 people in four states 602 of them from Washington and led to 171 hospitalizations and 4 deaths....please just be cautious because it can happen again ...I refuse to eat here or ANY Jack in the box because of this!!!!<//Review><user>115674325511728785013</user>< resp>

Good food fast service, the food is served hot and tasty.  Good Place to have lunch with a bunch of your friends  or family the atmosphere is open and Airy and not noisy. Love the self serve drink machine, you get to choose the type of drink and the flavors  you want.  There's plenty of parking and if you don't plan on staying they have a drive-thru.  Just in case you may not know it, keep your receipt because you can call a number and answer some questions about your visit and your food things like that and after you done with the survey they will give you a number to write on your Jack-in-the-Box receipt. Take your receipt back to Jack In The Box and redeem it for a Jumbo Jack or Supreme croissant, it's a buy one and get one for free deals.   : )</text>

<review>Jack in the box, though it's not that great for food always, is always there for you. Bathrooms and stoner food at 2am, 1 dollar drinks during the summer. They may not be great at their jobs of making food, but they are still great people.
The tacos may be the quality of dog food, but they're still free with a survey.<//review><gmapID>0x80dca6202ad8ba8d:0x2f5c9702a6125259< /gmapID><user_name>Malakai Unland<//user_name><Time>1550092403908<//Time><user>115919369143735184555</user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The food is good... Service is okay. The fact that they haven't called the cops on me is cool...but they will so don't push it. Recently there's been a shortage of TP when I visit...  I asked for some and I got it. Check the stalls' supply prior to engagement, as they have been sharing "A" Roll.<//Text><resp>None< /resp><Time>1539497039677</Time>< Name>

Stopped to get lunch and went in to use the restroom. Disgusting, TONS of paper and pee all over floor and toilet. Looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a long time.. in spite of the sign that said we pride ourselves on cleanliness. Tried to tell someone, walked up to counter, where they take orders, and it was filthy with handprints. Waited for someone to help me and after 3 minutes no one came to help me, even the person in a different uniform that I am guessing was a manager or at least supervisor. The floor was disgusting as well. I just left</Review>

Most people probably don't know this, but jack in the box has some of the best egg rolls available at the restaraunt level. They're better than any chinese food place around, hands down. When you order yours, be sure to tell them that #TheMattressMaverick said that you should try them out</Text>

This location makes me really dislike jack n the box, all the way around.. .  Almost to the point of hating it and refusing to go to any of them in the franchise. But I do try n remind myself that every location and every manager is different and it's ultimately up to them to correct the problem(s) that were encountered during the visit. But I fully feel that the staff here are very judgemental and also they are haters and they really need to change their attitudes towards people who are spending their restaurant..... homeless or not..<//text>

<review>It was awful, I went threw the drive threw got my hot coffee spilt on me. They didn't give me my receipt or credit card I had to call them and when I went back into the restaurant I had to wait ten minutes to get my new printed receipt  because they were trying to fix the cash register while customers were waiting. I'm a senior citizen and wife of a Vet and it saddens me that the new generation are very rude and uncaring. Also my food was cold and I would not recommend this store to my friends<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Horrible customer service and the workers are lazy and hard of hearing made me go back around through the drive thru to make a postmates order after already waiting in a long line . Slowest Jack in the box in moval I would recommend driving an extra mile to another location.< /review>

This place is right off the freeway.  We went there while traveling.  We stopped in to use the restroom and then eat. The bathrooms were so incredibly messy that we left without eating.  I would not go back there again.< /Review>

Man going here is like gambling at a casino, I have gotten the nastiest sourdough meal from this location that I have EVER gotten from anywhere! It was a sloppy, soggy, nasty mess! In fairness I have also gotten some good ones too. Same odds with the curly fries too. So good luck.<//Review>

This jack in the box on sunnymead has homeless people chilling at the front doors looking at you like they want you to feel sorry for them and buy them something to eat. To save yourself from that go to another jack in the box or go to the drive thru.</review>

Food is made fast and the quality is better than other locations.  The drive thru workers know the right questions to ask, they dont interrupt you when you order, and they always give napkins! Simple things like this make going to this location enjoyable!< /review>

This has to be the worst Jack in the Box I have ever been to. My girlfriend lives down the street and I figured it would be a convenient place to get us a late dinner. Unfortunately, both times I have gone there, the order has been messed up. Items forgotten, food cold or not properly cooked, or the wrong order was given to us while our order waa given to someone else. I doubt that we'll be going back to this location again.<//Review>

<Review>Disgusting. Most of the tables were dirty and empty for over a half hour. I can understand if they were busy. But they were not, there was maybe 5 of us total seated. The bathroom was beyond nasty, there was blood on the wall, the toilet was the filthiest thing ever and there was no toilet paper.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Ive been here off and on since 2010.   And everytime ive been through the drive thru, it never fails , something is wrong with my order.  Most of the time my food is cold especially the fries, they're hard and cold.
Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I cant remember ever having a pleasant experience here.  I love jack in the box for a quick lunch.  But ive learned not to come to this one!  By the way the tall blonde female manager is rude if you bring the problem to her attention.  And will want you to wait before she'll properly address the problem.</Text>< user_id>

<text>Bad experience every single time going thru the drive thru. I live 4 minutes from this location, fries cold n stale. Bread dry, cheese cold (as in not cooked with burger, but thrown on after.) Special orders go in one ear n out the other (grilled onions=u get get reg onions in yur burger; no onions=onions in yur burger)

I would drive the extra time n mile to the other locations.

I walk in to make my order,  as the worker tried to swipe my card and failed, I explain to her it usually has problems swiping and asked if she could punch in the numbers instead. The worker called over manager to assist punching in the numbers, the manager(who was really, REALLY rude) (short black hair Hispanic maybe?) came and snatched the card and started aggressively swiping my card to a point it was bending. I afraid it was going to break. So I stopped her and asked politely to enter the numbers in (which they have done at other locations)she snapped back: "we do not enter in card numbers, you probally don't have money in your account."(I know,  rude right?!) So to avoid any problems,  I left and drove to wells Fargo across the street to get money. Return with my payment and asked to speak to the manager about her unnecessary comment earliar. She ignored me. But the worker apologized for the inconvenience.  I didn't get any names wish I had.</text>< Pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) The worst customer service ... the employees of today August 8. At 5.30pm they ignore the customers who enter the restaurant and it is worse if they are Latino or black ... with whites they have better service. I was there waiting for service And the employees do not even greet the customers who come to order inside. They ignore them and pass by them and do not look at them, they are ignorant who do not know that the one who orders in the car will pay the same as the one who gets off ordering inside ... if there were less than one star to qualify for jack in the box, I would give it to them..in all Jack in the box they ignore the customer who comes in to order.😣. good thing that as customers we have other options. .
