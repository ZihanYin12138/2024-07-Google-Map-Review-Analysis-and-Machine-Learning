< Review>
Hands down the best restaurant in San Francisco ! The Chef is a god with food and the bartender is incredible.  The service was exceptional.  Elegance and romantic atmosphere, minus the live karaoke guy in the corner.
Will definitely be back and recommend this place to all.</Review>

It was so beautiful and warm from the heaters they had. The prices vary from what you order. We had steak, chicken, crab cakes, sides (sharable) & drinks and for 4. The bill came to 483 gratuity included. But we still tipped ☺️<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVTi-S2TYyHvApJ8o1hhQV2ZozqcyTUaLreekC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfkihkYu0ltNw1CwcCl7ByTeDRObB6eUzi4Bzx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Amazing steaks and lobster. The service was exceptional as well.  I ordered the bone in Filet and it came out luscious and succulent- made to perfection. Must recommend for a date night.</review>

The service was amazing. I took my bestie for her  b-day they went above and beyond. As we eat we watched our car being broken into. They held our food while attended to the car. Comp our desert and nice glass of champagne for out trouble. Amazing food. The butter cake to die for.  Just an amazing restaurant but the outside surroundings are the slums. Definitely not a cheap date< /Review>

Steaks and drinks excellent. Service on point. Management was aloof and not as professional as the experienced staff. The bartender was rude to my date, post meal which left us walking away sad. We spent over 500 dollars for the two of us, including 15 for every side of butter not included with the meal. Lobster mashed potatoes are soupy. I commented to the manager who insisted they are supposed to be soupy. He also made it clear he's afraid to criticize the chef. I've been in the industry for almost 30 years. Auto-gratuity hurts the staff. Just being honest.<//Text>

I never take time to post a negative review, but in this case I feel it is warranted. The service was subpar, the food was brought out cold (twice) and everything was salty. Even the desserts were undesirable. I would only recommend this place for drinks and the sorbet. While the managerial staff was kind and accommodating, it did not make up for the overall experience.< /Review>

<Name>L Noble</Name><review>The food was great! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Indoor seating is Covid-19 friendly with the business at 25% compassity. The menu is some what pricey.  During this partial opening the menu has been revised. No sushi, no seared tuna and no Bone marrow to name a few. I was told that they would start to serve it again in a couple of weeks. We'll see. There is also a 20% service fee included to your bill during this partial opening. All in all, with the great ambiance, food and drinks I will definitely be back and I definitely recommend.< /review><userid>112909136850968495488</userid>< Rating>

Celebrated my birthday here. Sat in the rooftop semi-outdoor space. It was a bit cool as the skin went down, but still a comfortable experience. We started with cocktails (good), crab cocktail appetizer (ok. Seemed previously frozen) and the bone-in filet, bone-in ribeye, sauteed broccoli, and lobster mac and cheese. Overall tasty meal. They surprised me with a complimentary slice of cheesecake beautifully decorated. We also ordered the butter cake which was amazing. We will certainly be back!</Text>

<Review>Great outdoor dining option in times of covid. Great cocktails, exceptional wine offerings and a world class steak with tons of sides to boot. Seafood offerings are second to none, fresh and worthy of constructing your own custom tower. Welcome to San Francisco. Cheers< /Review>< Pictures>

Shout-out to Kristina- answered all my questions, was friendly, attentive, and the perfect waitress all around.

The drinks alone are to DIE for- house infused vodka?! Yes please! I had a cosmo and lemon drop, highly recommend.

The food was unreal! I had lobster bisque, their mushrooms and mashed potatoes as appetizers. The meal was a rack of lamb with truffle butter, my dates the twin lobster tail. It was delicious!!!! We had butter cake as desert- and oh my goooodddd! PLEASE get it! It's un-frickin-real! Live music, which was awesome btw! Thank you so much to the ENTIRE staff- awesome meal, and an experience I'll remember for years to come. Decades even! Will DEFINITELY come back when I have another pretty penny to spend. ,💚💚💚😊<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I made reservations here for my moms birthday. I didnt realize it at the time but it requires to be dressed up a bit. The people at the front desk said were fine and took us in. We were treated very well and everyone was attentive. This was the BEST dinner we ever had. My mom and I are planning to go back in thw future. It may be a bit pricy but its worth every cent. Highly recommend<//text>

Phenominal food with fabulous service & an elegant, moody atomoshphere. Maestros is the bomb for steak houses in SF.. Lounge over dinner with fabulous drinks and with a savioy wine list. We had buttery New York Strip, Rib Eye with bone, fresh asparagus and not enough room for desserr. Truly a gift in San Francisco.  Last reservation is 10pm and it's quieter during Kovid<//Review>

We had a 3 hour experience that should have been limited to 1 1/2 hrs as stated by the restaurants COVID policy. The additional 1 1/2 hr was attributed to very poor service.  We had an $800 tab and it took us 20 mins to attempt to get the check.

Great food, horrible service.<//Review>

<Text>This is my wife's favorite restaurant.  The service is outstanding, fun atmosphere, great music.  Be ready for an "eclectic" crowd.  But that's kind of fun.  The steak rubs are just next level.  Done flawlessly.  It's expensive but it's so worth it it's not even funny.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808581e76ab80ee9:0x20d6791cd5ff982a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Mixed review. The food was mostly excellent except for the lobster mash potatoes, it is definitely not what the picture online portrays & mgr responded Oh we jazz it up for the internet. It was dark so used the phone light to check the lobster quantity & mgr decided to comp since it was disappointing. First upscale restaurant I ever been to that charges for first basket of bread then the rest is on them, took 30mins for 1st basket & never brought a second after requested. However my steak was delicious & sautéed spinach. Maybe I'll try them again just a different location for sure.</text>

Finally got the chance to celebrate my baby’s birthday!! He loved it! The social distancing was amazing - tables were empty on both sides of us - the food was delicious as usual- I have visited your Chicago and Las Vegas spots - parking was easy ..service was unmatched!! Can’t wait to go back !!
Thank you!!</review>

Wow...probably the best takeout experience ever. I had the good fortune to call and speak with Holden. He made great suggestions when I ordered - specifically the amazing butter cake. Everything was packed perfectly and beautifully. My order was promptly brought out to my car curbside and placed in the backseat. Everything was still hot by the time I got home. Steaks cooked perfectly. Pricey?  Yes. Worth it?  YES!! Looking forward to ordering again soon. Thanks Holden!<//text>

Didn't make reservation for a Friday night but there weren't that many people so got seated right away. We came here for their famous hot cake. We had it in their LA location and it was so so tasty. Did the one in SF match up? It was tasty but a bit lacking. It didn't taste as fresh because the cake part wasn't totally soft and moist, and it came out a tad colder than we remembered it to be. We still managed to finish the giant cake and it satisfied our sweettooth. In addition, there was live music but the genre of music did not match the ambience of the restaurant.< /review>

<Text>So good. The sides are definitely great for sharing and the food is insanity. I got the lamb entree and practically sighed or moaned after every bite.
Also, right now cause of covid, its only rooftop/patio seating. But honestly that was great. Came in at 7pm and one person had the sun in their face but it was low enough to not be within 15 minutes.
Would definitely recommend if you want to try and celebrate when celebrating feels impossible due to the pandemic.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Honestly I am very shocked by the Google rating of this restaurant, considering that they DO NOT know how to cook a steak properly. We have been in quarantine awhile though, people must have forgotten what fine dining looks like. Don't bother wasting your money here. My friend ordered a $140 steak, medium rare, and it came out medium well, almost looked burnt on some parts. Instead of making a new one, the staff tried convince him that he doesn't know what a medium well looks like 🙄 . They basically refused to replace it even though he was very unhappy with it. Terrible service. Also this company refuses to refund for the steak, and does not respond to customer phone calls or emails. For the $500 wasted here, we could've went to Gary Danko.<//Review>

This is my third time at Mastros. My goal was to support during Covid and they totally missed the mark.
They over booked and under staffed. Food came out cold, cocktails were ordered and didn’t come out for 30 minutes, it was misty and manager wouldn’t close roof even 1/2 way, bathrooms were disgusting and customers were not observing the mask rule in the waiting room and the hostess was not enforcing!
Very very disappointing for those of us expecting an upscale experience but receiving sub par evening.</Text>

<review>Possibly the best dining experience myself and my partner have experienced.
Troy, the bartender/waiter was so excellent and really made the night! He went above and beyond in service. Whoever manages/owns this place should definitely take care of him! All of the staff were excellent and food was absolutely delicious. We had the filet steak which was tender and perfectly cooked, and steamed broccoli which was refreshingly not over steamed, and the fries were amazing. The butter cake was insane and huge, I won’t need breakfast tomorrow.
Thanks for a great experience!< /review><Response>None<//Response>< Name>

<Text>Amazing steakhouse with fantastic service.  The seafood was fresh and flavorful. Server put together a seafood tower featuring crabmeat, shrimp and snow crab legs. Presentation on point. Good list of cocktails and wine.  I ordered heart of the rib eye it was cooked to perfection. We had a table of 7 and ordered all of the sides. Skip the scallop potatoes. The lobster mashed potatoes are where it's at.</Text>< pictures>

<rating>3</rating><Text>We went to the newly opened Mastro's for a birthday dinner.  Unfortunately it was a rather disappointing experience.  The atmosphere was just okay - background music was a bit too loud.  Service was way too chatty and over-attentive for a fine dining experience - I prefer staff who is attentive from afar and quickly available with a glance/signal, rather than constantly coming to the table and interrupting conversation.  Finally, the food was mediocre at best.  The salmon was oddly soft and watery and lacked flavor, which was especially disappointing considering this Mastro's touts themselves as a seafood restaurant.  I don't see us returning in the future.</Text>< pictures>

Main appetizer was the  Sauteed shrimp which came cold the sides were lobster macaroni and lobster mash were very blah in fact the lobster mash gave one of my friends in upset stomach and was really fishy service was also an issue in the beginning was fantastic toward the 2nd half the meal they forgot to bring extra dressing as well as another basket of bread as well as my wine which they completely forgot to bring which later on the end of giving to me for free but after the fact being that the meal was already done even the butter cake tasted burnt at the end I was very disappointed nothing like mastros in Beverly Hills.< /Text>

Solid steakhouse with some live music on the second floor on certain days (I think they moved it to the third floor / roof per covid stuff).  Split some wagyu with friends and try out the scallops you won't regret it.< /Text>

Attentive but very slow staff,  food & ambience is the winner....

Also was asked to take my hat off, which I have to say made me happy and reminded me of the old days when people looked the part...</Text>

My Star Scale:
1 Star = Do not recommend
2 Star = Do not recommend but there were      positive aspects of the experience.
3 Star = Would recommend
4 Star = Would recommend ++service OR ++ food OR ++ ambiance (2 of 3)
5 Star = Would recommend ++service AND ++ food AND ++ambiance (3 of 3)

So the new Mastro's in SF is all about the hype and they definitely come though. Rediculous ambiance and service to back up the food, you are definitely getting your money's worth at this awesome high end steak and seafood restaurant. I've been to other Mastro's locations and this one ranks highly amongst the chain.  The attention to detail and food execution was impressive. Gluten free items are in abundance here and since they serve a la carte, ordering gluten free couldn't be easier!  By design, appetizers and side dishes are meant to be served family style. We went with lobster mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and steamed spinach. All awesome choices and very complementary to the main dishes we all chose.   Mastro's is known for their steaks right?  So I ordered up a Kansas City strip (basically a bone in NY strip). Bone in, changed the entire flavor profile of the strip for me and took it to an entirely different level. They asked how I would like it cooked and they hit it exactly as I asked for, medium with red in the center (a true medium).  Mastro's also serves A5 wagyu at up to $300 bucks a cut, but I know what I can appreciate and the strip I ordered was absolutely delicious.  We didn't order seafood during this visit but I've had the signature seafood tower here before and if you are up for awesome chilled lobster, crab, oysters, shrimp etc, this is a must have.  We corked our our own wine but the wine selection is never ending here, and they have a great selection at various price points to fit what you are looking for. Very attentive wait service but not overwhelming at the same time.  5 Star for sure.  If your are looking for high end quality food, awesome service and fantastic ambiance then this is the spot to go to. You don't just stumble across Mastro's SF, you plan on going there....< /text>

I will highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a really nice upscale dinner without getting a coursed meal.
There is a strict upscale dress code.
Making reservations its ez by phone or online.
The cork fee is 40 dollars for a 750mil bottle.
We opted to bring our bottle of Dom perignon witch if purchased on side will run you for $300
So I payed $170 for my bottle plus $40 cork fee and saved me a few  bucks.
Prices are to be expected high, and average tap for 2 with a few cocktails a few appetisers 2 antrees and dessert will run at about  $300+.
We had 2 appetisers, 2 cocktails, 2 antrees, 2 side dishes and a dessert.
Our bill was 375$
Here is a list of dishes ordered.
Roasted bone marrow.
Seafood tower.
South of France cocktail.
Elder flower martini.
Filet 8oz.
Bone-In Filet 12oz.
Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi.
Rosemary Garlic Sautéed Mushrooms.
Butter Cake.
The Bone marrow is really good an will recomend it to anyone willing to try something new. How ever the one we got was a bit gamey. I have to say I had better but I would still recommend it.
please note that the seafood tower is fully customisable and they will plated on a tower with dri ice on it witch make it really cool and hazy I recommend if your trying to impress your special someone or if you just love sea food we got shrimp cocktail which is 3 jumbo size shrimp they are extremely fresh and succulent also got 2 king crab claws that I would not recommend getting due to their small size your better of getting the king crab legs.
The 2 cocktail we got were really good and would recommend trying them out.
The filets were good but I wish I actually had ordered the Bone in ribeye.
The side dishes were delicious and huge they come on a big hot saute pan which completely kill the hole upscale dinner experience in my opinion.
I mean here we are sitting with this really nice dinner on a beautiful set table and the they bring out two big sauté pans and leave them there on the middle on the table personally I would recommend the sides to be plated on a nice side dish patle or some kind of small cast iron plate but that's just me.
Over all our experience here was amazing and the food was great along with really nice and friendly staff and professionall service.</review>

If you’re looking for a fantastic steakhouse with quality steak, amazing service, great ambience and satisfaction for the premium price, KEEP LOOKING.... Most overrated restaurant and dining experience in SF. I had high hopes for Mastro’s. They have some serious kinks to work out in this restaurant. I have never waited so long (nearly an hour) for a table when a reservation was booked in advance. It took 30 minutes to get drinks after we put our order in at the bar while waiting. By the time we got seated and our orders came, we literally spent 3.5 hours in this place and we were only 2 people. And the most peculiar thing is apparently the VIP bread basket is the most exclusive item on their menu. It literally took 30 minutes before we finally got a bread basket, despite my multiple check-ins.

Management has not spent enough time educating their staff on the menu or the wine list.

The ambience was almost like walking into the set of a ghetto music video. Why is the music so loud and obnoxious? Why does the decor look like a high end brothel? For such an expensive restaurant, this place has ZERO CLASS and poor ambiance.

The only positives here were our table server had a lovely personality. Unfortunately, poor management and operational inefficiencies make her job very hard.

Food wise, I don’t find the product worth the price. I ordered a fillet medium rare. It was ok at best. It was dry, had no tenderness, and was over-salted. The Brussel sprouts tasted like the grass growing in my backyard with some salt poured over it. There was so much cream in the mashed potatoes, I thought I had drank an entire gravy boat after two bites.

Drink wise, if you’re going to charge $20+ for a cocktail on the rocks, use a single clear ice cube. That is standard at most cocktail bars when ordering an old fashioned or similar cocktail. Mastro’s used the same ice in the cocktails as their water glasses.

Additionally, the design is poorly done. For a massive two story restaurant, there should be a bathroom available on each level. Also, at this price point there should be valet parking.

Every steakhouse in SF is better than this one, including your own house with a cut of grocery chain store meat on the grill.

Save your time and  money. Go elsewhere.</review>

<Date>1522111546154</Date><rate>5< /rate><review>I honestly love coming to this office and the care I get when I do!

I had tried seeing a chiropractor once about 8 years ago but didn't get much benefit out of it and didn't really see the value at the time. I'm glad to report that this office has since changed my mind! Between the wonderful chiropractic doctors and the amazing massage therapists, there are no lasting issues from a car accident I had been in before I started coming here but I also no longer have certain pains that I had suffered for over a decade.

I've had a wonderful experience every time I've gone in and everyone is so friendly and helpful! I love going for my appointments and I'm sure you will too. If you're looking for good chiropractic care, check this place out.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
I've been a patient for over 20 years and I've always believed in the the care and support I get from staff and doctors.  I'd rather have chiropractic care for back, shoulder, leg pain, than going to the traditional doctor for pain meds. The results are faster and true, rather than a pill to mask a problem, which also means  I feel better without side effects.</Review>

Feel like a new man 😁 everytime I leave. Michael McMurray from San Jose was my Dr. of Chiropractics for 10 years now I don't have to drive 83 miles once or twice a week. Blessed and highly favored.</text>

I've known Dr. John for over 20 years and seen his practice and techniques just continue to get better.  He now uses an "activator" more often than manual adjustments.  I was skeptical but this is FAR gentler and  in my opinion more effective.<//Text>

<Text>Very irritated. First appointment visit for my wife was supposed to be $68. Front desk said $100 because it covers 3 x 15 minutes massages for the first 3 visits. She's not there to be massaged. She's there to be adjusted (never had this issue with a chiropractor). Then they said the appointment was at 4pm. My wife asked if she would be out by 5pm for work and the lady said she would. 4:30pm and shes still in the waiting room, even though she came 10 minutes early! Then, the chiropractor says he wants to see her next week because she has a lot wrong with her. She just turned 34 today, is active, flexible, healthy, etc., and there's a lot wrong with her? Then, I needed to make an appointment for her for something that deals with her sinuses at the hospital we go to where everything is covered. This hack tells her to not make the appointment yet because they offer services to help with that, which our insurance wont cover, so that would be more out of pocket. I don't trust this place ONE BIT!!! The only reason that I didnt give them worse of a review (besides that google wont let you do 0 stars) is because they did adjust her well. So, apparently, they do good work. They just lie to you about the cost, the time, and are there more for your money than your benefit. If my wife does go again, I will be there so she wont get screwed, but dont count on it.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I have been a patient of Dr. James since 2016. I had a lot of neck and shoulder issues. My daily pain levels have been greatly reduced. The staff is friendly and great to work with. I really recommend getting a 15 minute massage before your adjustment. Beau is especially awesome!</Review>

Finding Vallejo Chiropractic has allowed me to get my mobility back.
Afer slipping down my stairs, I found I was not able to walk more than 800 steps a day with out experiencing extreme pain. After only four adjuments, I felt like a was ready to conquer the world.
Of course additional treatments were needed, but going from a 10 pain level to 4-5 on my worse days - gave my life back. The staff are friendly and Dr. James always greets me with a smile. Each week he ensured me I would achieve my 10,000 steps per day with continued care. I have reach my goal and I could not be more grateful for the care I received.
On weeks that I am feeling wound up, Beau is a great massage therapist. Gentle and always willing to work on the sore areas.
I could not ask for more caring people. Extremely satisfied!! Thank you........</Review>

< review>
I had a back injury about 13 years ago and have seen 3 other chiropractors in the past, all 3 telling me I had no way of relieving the pain unless I saw them every 2 weeks. A friend then suggest I come to Vallejo Chiropractic and see Dr. Harrington. My goodness, this man and his colleagues, all of the same pedigree in their specialties, have been able to relieve my back pain. Doc told me his goal is to not see me. Within the first 3 months, he was able to get my visits down to every 7 weeks. They have helped me through a sciatica attack and through 9 months of my pregnancy and now 6 months post partum. I love what they offer and will continue to come here for years to come.<//review>

It's more than chiropractic care, it's total body care! I have a degenerative disc in my back and two bulging discs in my neck, and that can make it rough sometimes working as a lineman, but these guys keep me going. They have three doctors but I've only seen two, Dr John and Dr James. Using the body scan method they can pinpoint where things are out of alignment and make the necessary corrections with the Activator which makes micro adjustments or they can do a good old fashioned manual adjustment. I usually opt for the Activator, unless I feel the need for a little more and go with a manual or drop table. All the massage therapist are good and have their own unique style. Beau has recently started taping my back which has surprisingly helped. Shanon has a one of a kind massage technique that completely relaxes your body and her hour massage is well worth the price. So there are a lot of options to get your body working and feeling better.lo</text>

My back definitely feels 70% better after Dr. Jame's Session.  I overworked my back until I fouind myself in more strain and tightness than I've ever felt.  There is no way I'd be able to go to work today if I hadn't gotten that quick readjustment. And the women in the office was the sweetest! Good people. Thank you, Vallejo Chiropractic! (Only 10$ with Kaiser insurance coverage., DEAL!)</Review>

I went to this school from kindergarten through 4th grade. I don't know where to start. The amount of homework given at this school is ridiculous. The amount of time to eat compared to the amount of time to sit around and hangout on freetime is just sad. Give this a thumbs up if you don't like this school.< /Review>

I base my entire life off of the ten core values and everything I do revolves around them. My knowledge of the founding fathers of our beautiful and simply exquisite country has increased dramatically since arriving here. I've learned many useful skills that I am sure I can apply later in life like 2 years of Latin (a very useful language that is spoken often if you live in the 5th century) or knowledge of what Joan of Arc's middle name was or the number of acres George Washington owned. I also simply love being able to choose between three whole outfits to wear each day which consist of a very comfortable collared polo shirts and stylish slacks. Highly recommend this school to everyone if they also want to become a Latin speaking classical learner.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Don't listen to the hating kids' reviews, they couldn't even spell "torcher" right. John Adams isn't perfect, but it's a great school. The environment is friendly and respectful, bullying never happens and it's easy to make friends with the other scholars and teachers. The classical education is also a plus, and the scheduling is great for high school, makes the workload easier to manage. Not a bad school overall, though lacking in a place to play, like a real grass area, unlike the other JAA school in Lincoln and El Dorado. As a scholar here, I'd recommend it!</Text>< Pictures>

Amazing. That is the one word that comes to my mind when describing this school and it's staff. We have a child that requires special accommodations and John Adams Academy has gone over and beyond to help assist our child. There are no words to express are complete gratitude but you at least deserve a wonderful review.< /Review>

So many wonderful families attend.  This school requires a 40 hour a year volunteer commitment per family, which really helps bring in strong families.  My children are receiving a great education.  We love the 10 core values they teach the students.  They are taught them everyday.  We appreciate the patriotism our children are learning.  And one thing we notice compared to our public school is the way they tackle problems and issues in a quick and well thought manner.  We are very pleased with our experience here.< /review>< Pictures>

The idea that a child can receive a high quality liberal arts classical education at a tuition free public charter is an educational game changer.

The school board is experienced, principled, and in touch with the day to day operations of the school. They, along with administration, are always seeking to improve the quality of education offered to the scholars.

Like any school, John Adams Academy has challenges unique to its location, demographics, institutional type, and educational philosophy. However, on the whole, everyone from the facilities crew to the school board are dedicated to providing the best education possible to as many scholars as possible. It is not uncommon for administration, teachers, and support staff to volunteer extra unpaid hours, supplies, or resources to improve the overall educational atmosphere of the school.

I highly recommend John Adams Academy.</Text>< pictures>

<Date>1522098866555<//Date><text>Overall my family has been happy with the education and experience our children have received as JAA scholars. We’ve been with the school since it opened and have witnessed many challenges and successes. I struggled at first making the move as I wasn’t sure how my kids would respond to the transition from a public school to a charter, but I am very happy with the results. The classical education experience has been challenging, but has rewarded my kids with a well rounded approach to learning and thinking. The foundation of servant leadership and ten core values have helped guide choices and actions and given the scholars a high ceiling to strive for.

We’ve loved the different instructors and mentors the kids have had spent time with. The teachers are extremely hard working and many of them highly qualified in their respective subjects. Overall we’ve enjoyed the open communication with the staff and administrators. We spend a good amount of time volunteering and taking an active role at the school, which has allowed us see first hand how much the folks we’ve been involved with love and enjoy our kids.< /text></record>

<Text>It is now my senior year at John Adams, and I would highly recommend putting your children here if they wish to learn. Most of those who posted a bad review did so because of their lack of willingness to learn and to do their work. It is a tough school, and there is lots of reading and annotating of primary sources but the main reason that it is a good school is because the teachers and curriculum are there to get you to think. The books I have read and the discussions I have had in class are far more advanced then anything my friends at other public schools are reading. In order to get the best grades, you have to be able to show that you can think, not just that you can memorize. As with any school there are minor problems, but the drama level is surprisingly low, and the people are quite friendly. It is a good choice of school: the people who have the best experiences here are the ones who are willing to learn, and do their work.< /Text>< pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Student since the first year here! I have attended the school since fourth grade. I am now a Senior. I can honestly say that I love this school. The teachers are amazing (with a few exceptions, as with any school). They are honestly great people and take the time to get to know you personally. They will stop and ask how you are doing in the halls, make sure you don't need help on homework, and genuinely want to learn from the scholars as well as teach. The staff is friendly and helpful, and most of the scholars are nice and studious (we don't have bullying problems or much swearing because the majority of scholars are religious [LDS and Catholic are the two big ones]) Sadly, the administration is not as good, having a tendency toward unpreparedness and inconsistency. This is probably not the school for you if you don't enjoy a rigorous education. There are often philosophical discussions, debates, and socratic discussions, even in classes such as math and science. We don't have a great sports program unfortunately. However,  we have great music and art program and plenty of things to do if you are interested in debate, philosophy and a classic education. I highly recommend checking out the library.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This year's administration is by far the worst it has ever been in the school's seven-year history. They show favoritism and bias among students. Inadequate communication with parents. They promote a culture of violence instead of greatness. They favor the bully than those that are bullied. Administration does not believe an actual punch in the face is a threat, but just saying you will is worthy of 2 days suspension  Careful about putting your kids in here< /review>

<Text>I'm disappointed in the amount of school work given on holidays. Instead of spending time with your family, the kids will be caught up in school work.  Caution! putting your kids in this school will take away from important family time. Time we can never get back.

This school literally sucks. It appears to be all good, to the adults(why its has high rating on facebook) but in reality...... To the students its almost like a boot camp.... It really sucks. And only half an hour of lunch time... Not enough time in my opinion. And then there's the uniform... Don't get me started<//text>

<Text>First of all it, it really depends on the teacher you get. JAA is not right for everyone. They have a unique teaching style that may not be right for everyone. And I saw a review that said there are to many Mormons, and from experience I can tell you that alot Mormons who go to public schools get bullied because they have different standards. Also the uniform, they have a uniform for 1:students don't get bullied because of their style 2:so students do not get categorized on the clothes they wear 3:so scholars learn to express themselves through the arts. This school is still young, I have been here from the start, so why not give it a try?<//Text>< Pics>

Teachers here are pretty excellent except that they always give the kids tardiness when it's not their fault.  Sometimes kids walk in the room and get a tardy and mabye detention for being late.... is this really fair or reasonable.  At least give the kids more time to get to school or find out where they live site people can understand the time it takes to get there... all in all it is pretty dumb and harsh.< /Text>

​This being my first year at John Adams, I have learned more than any public school has ever offered me. I have learned to appreciate the gift of education more than before and I have learned beautiful life skills that will allow me success in the future. John Adams has encouraged me to reach for the stars, but not to even stop there. The staff works individually with each Scholar, taking personal time out of their day to invest in us and help us succeed. They have devoted an entire hour in our school day for scholars to seek help from our teachers.
The Staff's goal is always to ensure that their Scholars are excelling and being equipped with tools that allow us to assist ourselves when our time comes to face the real world. They take time to get to know us, so us Scholars don't feel like we're walking into a cold learning environment.
JAA Staff have politely pushed me and challenged me to excel and challenge myself, both academically and personally. ​I've grown academically, with raising test scores, and I have grown personally, developing a deeper respect for myself and those around me.
John Adams has been nothing but an inspiration and support to me, opening doors of new opportunity and advancement.
So thank you John Adams Academy, for providing such a beautiful learning environment that I can thrive and grow in.<//text>

I go to this school and I have been to a normal school before and this place is terrible compared to other schools it's literally like the worst place on Earth that u can go to and if u are going to send your child here you are just trying to make your child go threw torcher. The teachers here are the worst and they don't care about none of the kids they just give u a lot of homework and don't care if u fail the class or not. This school sucls!!<//Review>

<Text>Nick is awesome very professional friendly and honest! I haven’t felt this relieved to have an honest mechanic(transmission specialist)in years! These guys aren’t looking for the extra buck or who they can get over on just plain old honest hardworking American mechanics!!! My friend had leaks in her van and Nick broke down everything we needed to know without trying to oversell us especially as women!!! I will always recommend this shop to friends and tell them to ask for Nick!!!</Text>< Pictures>

Nick was super informative and helpful when dropping off my Expedition. He was handling a difficult customer prior to me and the way he handle the situation and conducted himself was very reassuring to myself. AAMCO is certainly lucky to have him as an employee!< /Review>

Nick and Glen are both very helpful, honest, and efficient in getting my car taken care of. I have taken my car to this shop multiple times over the years and am always grateful for the lack of drama in getting things figured out and fixed quickly. They’re very reasonably priced and will tell you if something is not worth fixing or outside their expertise. I would recommend this establishment.<//Text>

I have never gone thru AAMCO till I needed a transmission in my car. The guys that work there are very professional and nice. They are all around great guys. I will definitely be using them again in the future if needed. I highly recommend going to this location.</text>

July 2020: Took are truck in again for some different issues. These guys are honest and always takes an extra step in taking care of their customers. We will continue to bring our vehicles here to them. The fix only what is necessary, if if they can take the extra step to making your vehicle run better, they do. Thanks again

June 2020: I really recommend this place, they worked on my husband's Dodge Ram 2500 diesel truck. They did good work, went above and beyond. We will be taking our vehicle here again real soon. They are honest, Thanks 😊< /review>

< review>
I have a small leak from the rear differential after a new transmission installed in February 2020.  Not caused by new transmission work and not serious.  After a Mechanic evaluated and test drove it, I got good advice to monitor it and if it worsens, invest in a low cost repair.</review>

Everything needed to be inspected for neglect as my little brother had my vehicle for a while he never checked or changed the oil (little brothers) so it went through a total inspection. Everything with a lubricant was serviced I got it back that afternoon and it's running great. I would take it to them without any second thoughts<//Text>

Nick and Glen are great! They replaced my transmission and my jeep runs great and they were less expensive than everyone else in town. That’s not the good part, They just looked at my Prius that stopped working, they jiggled the hybrid plug and told me to pick it up, no charge.
Honest, fast, fair and funny.
Thanks guys, your awesome!< /text>

They tell you the truth and are very friendly guys .I would refer they shop to anybody and everyone that needs a vehicle fixed.  They try to get it fixed in a reasonable manner and time.    We have been there 3 times with different cars.  Thanks guys  Happy with your work.</text>< pictures>

These guys are fantastic. I've had both my vehicles here for several different issues and referred several people to them. They always know exactly what the issue is and fix it quickly and effectively. They're reasonably priced too. AAMCO isn't just for transmissions, they are my go to for all my vehicles. I highly recommend these guys.< /review>

I brought my car in to the shop after I was advised that I might have a transmission issue.  I set up my appointment with Nick and was on his doorstep upon opening on Saturday.  He was very professional and offered to do a courtesy check at no charge.  He found no transmission issue but continued to try to troubleshoot the issue at no expense to me.  I appreciate his efforts and honesty.  I will definitely bring my vehicles here in the future and refer other customers who might have transmission issues.</text>

Nick the manager was incredible. He worked with me to find a universal part that saved me $900.00!  He also gave me a military discount. In fact, I plan to bring my second car in for service. Nick  and his crew are professional and courteous. Check them out.<//text>

<Review>Everyone that I interacted with at AAMCO were very professional and thorough. My transmission is working great!  The timeliness of service and cost was projected accurately.  I also received daily updates.  The only recommendation that I would make is to improve their after-hours drop-box.  Something that was secure (vehicle key) with a card to be filled out with appropriate information would be nice.  Job well done.  Thank you.<//Review><resp>None<//resp>< Name>

Having to get your transmission rebuilt is never a good experience, but the service and lack of communication at this location made a bad thing even worse. They were unrealistic about their time table, having my car for 5 days longer than what I was told was going to be "worst case scenario". They had had my car for 6 days before they even started on it, which I only found out when I called to see when it would be done the next day... It also ended up costing $500 more than the original "worst case scenario" I was quoted, and I understand that an estimate can go up, but don't say "worst case" if it is gonna go higher. If that wasn't bad enough I had to take it back because it wasn't driving right. Found out that one of the mounting bolts wasn't tightened down... Too busy for their own good!< /review>

Nick Netherby the center manager went above and beyond to help my family out with our trucks transmission problems. We came down for the day to Lincoln from Fresno and didn't know if we would be able to make the trip home. He ran codes, checked the trucks fluids, and spoke to me especially in a manner that I could understand about the trucks details. We feel confident in being able to make the drive home and to seek repairs at a later date. He really knows what he's talking about and if we lived here I would seek his advice/opinion before any other shops.</Review>

These guys are the best! Brought my car in for a rattling sound and Nick came out to listen to it and so far all it needed was oil..No thanks to the dealership! who was the last to change my oil..which technically it isnt due yet for a change. needless to say Nick's crew will be doing my next oil change and any repairs in the future! I have been here before and appreciated their honestly and care for their clients!</review>

<username>Don Artree< /username><review>Wonderful experience! I took my wife's Impala in for a second opinion after the first estimate was over $4800. Within a couple of hours, Nick got back to me that the problem was a minor issue and could be fixed for less than $200. Saved me loads of money and did it in a timely manner. I  recommend AAMCO in Roseville to anyone who asks.< /review></record>

Nick, did a great job. My rebuild took more parts and labor than the initial quote, but Nick worked it out so that AAMCO took the loss and I was charged the price of the original quotation. The car runs like it was new. I AM VERY HAPPY and will return if I need help again.< /Review>

I was very pleased with Aamco's service.  I have an old Dodge Grand Caravan with about 160,000 miles on it.  I Don't want to spend a lot of money to keep it going.  I had a check engine light and I knew the code was related to the transmission. On Sunday I made an appointment online for Monday at 8AM. They diagnosed it for free, called by noon with the estimate which was reasonable and they had my car fixed and ready to go that evening.< /Text>

<Review>I've been in the Sacramento area for give or take 2 years now. I've been around cars my whole life and have worked in mechanic shops myself. If there's an issue that I can't solve myself I bring it to these guys! I was never recommended to this shop. I did some online searching and took a chance and I'll let you know that that chance has paid off greatly! My wife and I have been bringing our vehicle's here for the past year and a half or so. As far as I'm concerned we've saved thousands of dollars on inspection/ diagnosis fees, parts and labor costs. The staff (Nick and Glenn specifically) are some of the most kind hearted, knowledgable people I've ever dealt with on a professional level. This isn't just another blood sucking mechanic shop after your money. Half the time you go in they know exactly what the problem is without even looking at it and are always willing to recommend a cheaper, more efficient plan of action if they know that their wait times and costs don't identify with your needs. All around beautiful business and I personally plan on keeping these guys in my back pocket for years to come.

Thank you Roseville AAMCO! You're the best!

I recently had a situation with my 01' Mercury Sable, took it in because it simply would not start! When I finally got it to start, took it in on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Didn't get it back until the next Wednesday, but that was because it started FOR THEM over & over, so they couldn't find the problem. Well, it turned out to be the fuel pump, which they got me a good deal on and we ended up paying a lot less than anticipated. Although, I had to keep calling them Nick & Glen were very curteous and helpful. I think I will take the car in again for care because the overall experience was very good!< /Text>

They were helpful and fast. I went in expecting to find out I had a huge bill and headache coming my way, but they found the problem in a matter of minutes and explained that they could fix it for me, or I could do it for a lot cheaper since it was such a simple problem. I will definitly be going to them again when I have car problems in the future!</review>

So took my truck to them and they diagnosed me with a oil leak. Said had a bad valve gasket cover and another gasket had them replace it. Took a day or so whatever. Then took it to them that Friday to have them do my cv axles and lower ball joints, which I was quoted for 700$  said it would be ready by the end of day. Then I get a call at like 1 saying that it’s gonna be 1000$... and the reason was that the estimate was not complete. Which I find weird but ok, and after all that I don’t even get my truck back Friday cuz the alignment guys were busy. And when I get my truck back it’s not fully aligned because one of the bolts was seized... so pay 1000$ to have to go spend more money on a alignment. Then once I have my truck back it starts to leak oil from the front diff. So had to drop it off and have them check it. Said they fixed it and it’s all good. Then the first day I drive my truck to work after picking it up again it leaks once again. So now I get to drop it off again. Pretty annoyed with the whole situation and not to happy so far with my experience from this place. Spent 1500$ to pick up my truck with issues that it didn’t have when I dropped it off<//text>

<Review>I would give no star if I could. They did one transmission and had it a week for repair. I thought it was my driving but it never felt right and it was slipping. Sold it to a person who loved Audi and fixed them up. So I got a different car (an Acura) and after 13 years went to them when the transmission went out and they had the car 9 days. That replacement transmission was rebuilt with all the extras and upgrades only lasted 9 months and it is slipping in 1st, 2nd and 3rd badly. They have has my car 8 days and still no word. I went to look after 4 days at the end of last week and my car was sitting there with the windows open and in the same spot. Not even a timeframe when it will be done. They need to pay for my car rental and give me a factory built transmission. This is really not ok.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I took my truck to Aamco for a new transmission. I thought it was going cost more than the truck was worth. But I was surprised at the price. Do get me wrong it was a lot but nothing compared to the other quotes I got. The work was done in a timely manner and the guys at the shop were very professional. Hopefully I don’t need any automotive work done in the future but if I do, I will use Aamco. Thanks Nick.< /Review>< username>

Glenn and Nick were extremely friendly, personable, and knowledgeable. I was mis-diagnosed with a bad transmission at another trans shop and was looking at almost $4,000 in repairs. I took it to AAMCO for a 2nd opinion and they were able to determine that it was a bad catalytic converter during a FREE inspection. It literally didn't cost me anything and they saved me literally thousands of dollars. I will be bringing all of my vehicles here in the future and recommend anyone do the same as they are very knowledgeable and honest. They will save you time and money! Thanks again guys!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Can't say enough about these guys!!!!!!!!  I was referred to them three years ago and they've done good by me on 4 different cars in my family.  Honest and hard-working.  They've answered every question I have ever given them and they thoroughly explain every answer.  Just yesterday I called them broken down out of town (bad spark plug, 2002 Sequoia) and they walked me through the likely problem so I could speak intelligently to the local Aamco.  They even offered to talk to the shop on my behalf.  These guys ACTUALLY care. Yes, these types of repair facilities still do exist.

<review>Thank you to Glen and his team at Roseville Aamco.  They made it much easier to deal with my car repairs.  Everything I was told occurred as it was explained and in a timely fashion.

I am very satisfied with the repairs they did and I highly recommend their services.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809b206ef5194877:0x8c0cb7ff209f009d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They guys here were great. Just talking to them on the phone I could tell a difference in quality from the Aamco in Auburn. They did a good job on the repairs/maintenance and even worked hard to finish in time so I could get my wife to her doctors appointment. I will defiantly be back if I have any problems with my vehicle that I can't fix myself.</Text>

Having moved to Roseville three years ago  from  out of state, one need to get new doctors, dentists, vets and most important an honest and reputable auto mechanic.  After a couple of attempts to find an auto mechanic and not being satisfied, I tried AMMCO Roseville.  Wow!  What a find--a real gem!  Glen and Nick are two great knowledgeable guys who approach their jobs with passion and a desire to provide excellent service to their customers.  Right from the start, I felt like I was treated like a person who needed service for my car, not just another customer here to help with the cash flow.  A truly great  place to take your car for repairs and service.</text>

Great service, they take the time to explain what's going on, and worked with me to figure out what was necessary to do now and what could wait.

Trust is important with car maintenance, and that's why I'll continue to being my car to these guys.< /Review>

<Review>I TOTALLY agree with all the 1 & 2 star reviews on this page. I had a rebuilt transmission put in last Sept 2016 and my car had to go back for trouble with the same said transmission. They kept my car for 1 month so rental car on my dime entailed. When I did finally get the car back...cables were left unplugged, a wire was cut and put back together with electrical tape, body cover underneath the car was just haphazardly tucked in and the  battery cover was missing! My VSA light is still on and won't go out from the first visit. There is now a loud squeaking sound when I hit bumps. I will NEVER return to the Roseville or any other AAMCO location because of this outrageous  experience and after reading these reviews. Thanks for your comments and letting me know I am not the only one experiencing this inadequate service!!!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
My car was overheating due to a failing thermostat so I brought it to AAMCO for the repairs. I felt that they were stalling on the diagnosis (4 days) so I did some research on my own and found that this was a very labor intensive repair for my specific vehicle (around 8 hrs). After the diagnosis I was told that they wouldn't be able to begin the repairs for a couple of days. I ended up taking the car to another shop who diagnosed and completed the repairs within two days (thank you Roseville Volkswagen). During this time I was in a rental car provided through my extended warranty with a time limit of five days, so getting the repairs done in a timely manner would have saved me from having to pay out of pocket for the rental. The reason I was dissatisfied was the lack of communication/directness. Yes, 8 hours to change a thermostat is probably not the most economical use of time for your techs. However, I would have greatly appreciated being advised to take my vehicle elsewhere in the interest of getting the repairs done in a timely manner. In fairness, the staff were friendly and knowledgeable but I will not be taking any of my vehicles here again.<//Review>

<Time>1501739310430< /Time><text>Brought my girlfriend's car over for an AC inspection. I scheduled an appointment 2 days before, and waited about 2 hours. It was a free AC inspection, therefore I understand the wait as there are a lot of paying customers that have been waiting for rebuilt transmissions, etc. Just make shre you are patient, or plan extremely ahead. There was wifi, so watched 2 episodes on Netflix to pass the time by quick. They were honest guys, and didn't try to upsell me like a dishonest shop would. The gentlemen were real nice.</text></record></dataset><record>

We took our GMC in as we noticed what appeared to be transmission fluid on the driveway under the vehicle... and Aamco were suppose to be the transmission experts.  To make a very, very long story shorter, after almost 2 weeks of them having our vehicle including test drives they informed us they found finally found issue.  We were told the rear seal on transmission was leaking, but transmission was fine, so we agreed to pay $300 to get it fixed.  They called to tell us the vehicle was fixed and that they were taking it on a final test drive to ensure all was working well.  Other than the length of time it took, at this point I was happy they found issue and got it fixed.  Next call, which we got was on our way over to the shop to pick up the vehicle, they told us that the transmission blew on the test drive.  I was thinking, well we brought them a running vehicle, they told us transmission was fine, and the transmission blew after their work on their test drive, so OF COURSE they would make it right and give us back a running vehicle.  But NO, they wanted thousands to rebuild our transmission.  The best they would offer was to give us a credit of the $300 toward the cost to rebuild transmission.  Um, not sure about you, but at this point I had lost all confidence in this establishment both as a repair facility and as a business that does the right thing or that takes care of their customers.  Since it was evident they weren't going to do the right thing, we just wanted vehicle back to take it to someone else for repairs, but they refused to release vehicle without us paying them the $300 (for blowing the transmission..really?)  Then it got even worse when they wanted us to come and get it or they would start charging us storage fees.  Really???  This is NOT how to run a business.  I understand things break, but the ones that break them should be responsible for fixing them, a moral that this business doesn't get.  We took vehicle to dealership in the end to get a new transmission and it runs great now.  But still  not happy that this little experience with Aamco cost us nearly $4,000.  I would NEVER take another vehicle to them.  If i want a vehicle destroyed, I would just send it over a cliff, much faster and cheaper, and a ton less aggravation.</text>

I've used this shop multiple times for my cars and truck.  I have received good service and a fair price, everytime.  They looked for ways to save me money, coupons, discounts, and did not recommend un-needed repairs.  I was expecting to have certain work done, but they were honest and told me that it was not needed at the time.  They could easily have just done the work and lined their pockets.  They are open on Saturday, which helps alot for pick up and drop offs for working couples.  They will be my mechanics from now on.< /text>

Guy saw a kid (me) walk in for his FREE AC Check and says some bs about the car without even looking at it and says it's going to cost at least an hour labor.. I asked why they advertise FREE everywhere but still want to charge me $110.. I then called the other AAMCO in Citrus Heights and they told me to come down and get it checked FREE LIKE AVERTISED. Ended up getting the system fixed for about $175 a pretty awesome deal if u ask me.. SCREW ROSEVILLE THEY SEE PEOPLE LIKE ME AND ASSUME THEY CAN SCREW YOU OUT OF MONEY FROM THE GET-GO.. Absolutely disgusted with how they treated me!<//text>

Nick called me and told me that there were pieces of metal in the transmission pan.  They said it could take a week to repair, dependent upon how fast my Maxcare Warranty company approved the repairs.  Well, some divine miracle must have happened because Maxcare decided not to send a rep out to inspect the transmission, rather, they chose to just approve the work!!!  Glen and Nick assured me that they would do all that they could to have my truck done by Friday October 16th, as our trip started Saturday October 17th,and we would leave on a 1500 mile trip.  They did it, they got it all done, rebuilt my entire transmission!  We left on time, no problems, no worries and never had any moments of "what was that".... Everything worked perfectly.  Many blessings and thanks to all at this Aampco.  You helped make our dream trip come true!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

On my vist to AAMCO wasn't really satify with the outcome as I was charge for getting my car back without no difference from the time. I took the car in as I don't think that I should have gotten charge at all the $215 dollars as my car wasn't fixed. The Mechanic came back to the front and acted like he knew what was wrong, but he should have known before having me come back and spending the extra $215 dollars this was robbery. If he was a good mechanic but reach in to take the $215 dollars from my pocket, I would have to make another trip to get the car fix for another $500 dollars more, while sweating on the hot days with the windows open and the
windows are down driving with no way of being cool in my car. Yes, I think I was made a sucker by that mechanic that should have told the people up front that the compressor was crack before having me come back and still leaving the place with my broken car which nothing was fixed as they said they would. I paid for myself to drive away with a broken car still. Not really satify and still sweating with the hot air flowing through my car. Rate this with one star the people up front were ok and cheerful. I don't think the five stars were at all what they deserve and I don't love it, if
I am still sweating in my car and the car is still broken.<//Review>

Had a transmission rebuilt by AAMCO #20992 in Redlands on 8/12/2015 ($5248.00) when I got to Sacramento, found that the 4WD no longer worked. I took the truck into this shop AAMCO #21494 on 8/20/2015 and was told they wanted $400.00 to investigate the problem??? Not a happy consumer! #rippedoff<//text>

Glenn was absolutely fantastic, I went in after AutoNation Honda incorrectly installed a battery, he saved me money with the free inspection they offer and gave me tips and a number to call for the future, he made my day much better.< /Review>

<review>After one year of having the transmission rebuilt I was backing out of the driveway the transmission locked up ,my daughter only used it for school and she only put about 2,500 miles on it so I called AAMCO and they told me it only had a 1 year warranty so I lost over $3,000 on a rebuilt transmission that I only put about 2,500 miles on it and the guy I talked to told me he put his best person on it .
I will not recommend this place in Roseville to anyone,
I had 2 cars serviced in Santa Clara in the past with no problems with AAMCO just the bad unprofessional job from the one in Roseville .<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Worst Place i ever had to deal with my entire life, took the car in they kept it for 2 weeks and most of their excused was "miss communication" or "we couldnt get to your car" and after 3 weeks of having the car back now the transmission is slipping, i'll never ever go there again< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1501088376154, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving us feedback.

The location is not so bad, it sits at the Ontario Mills mall, on the backside  near Nordstrom Rack, there or 3 chargers but one of them seems to ALLWAYS Be down, in that 3 chargering station the spacing with parking is very good.</review>

<Review>Security passes frequently, which is a good thing. I've seen them check the status on cars. However ppl keep unplugging my car from its charge, because the names are not on all the machines. Other times ppl unplugged me just to plug themselves in 😑, even though I had close to nothing of a charge. It's a busy mall, expect that to happen.<//Review>< pictures>

Kirsten is professional and knows her products. I have full coverage. They have travel agent and can also help with your rego tags (renewal etc). I don't have to go and wait at DMV! So happy for her help and love AAA insurance. Wish I had come here many years ago. Their towing service is fast. We needed a tow truck last night, he took our car to the mechanic shop we requested at 10pm. We are very satisfied with their service. Thank you.<//text>

I like the location and the services offered but it's wayyyyy more expensive than any other service repair shops that I've been to and I had to wait over a week to get an appointment, probably won't be back.</Review>

<text>One of the only AAA branches in this area open on Saturdays. Why are the other branches not offering this, as well?
Everyone at this branch is very polite, helpful and friendly. I've been to 3 other locations (Roseville Douglas Blvd, Sunrise Blvd and Natomas) and I've had negative experiences at each (they've rudely turned me away even though I've been a AAA customer for 10+ years and I have a platinum membership) but not this one. AAA Roseville Galleria is my new favorite location and will be going here from now on.<//text><time>1603780086087<//time>< userid>

Then she spoke again at top volume about how the governor should be recalled because a customer couldn't use the restroom because of covid. If I wanted to listen about politics I would go to a rally.

Nice surprise to find the donut farm coffee shop! We got a mocha and two donuts (lemon and black berry). The mocha was good, not among the best I've tried, but definitely worth the price. The donut are from the donut farm so nice and fresh, but I always wish they'd be even fruitier than they are! The staff is nice and welcoming, good place overall.< /Text>

This is the last place I visited before leaving state and it was a great send-off to say the least.
Every time I came to this spot, I was always greeted with a chill vibe and many vegan treats to scour and eventually, devour. The donuts are lit simply put and the soy lattes go hard here. I just love that this place is basically a vegan haven for you veg refugees out there looking for a solid and pretty affordable place. If you want a stable charge but not a jittery caffeine experience, the coffee does that with finesse here.
I remember many Gilman mornings with an east bay express in hand, coming here for those killer dairy free lattes. Topped off with a ciggy, you've got yourself the made in the bay.< /text>

This is a coffee branch of the Donut Farm store, so they sell Donut Farm vegan donuts, which I unfortunately recall as dry. It’s a cool, eclectic little shop with lots of loose leaf tea drinks, cold brew, and a full espresso bar. My latte, a nice baseline drink I like to try, was good, well proportioned, creamy, and well made. The roast was very earthy and had a distinctive taste, not my favorite blend, but interesting.< /review>

<Review>Everyone who works there is a delight to talk to, but the star of the show is the coffee.  It is the only place I’ve been to that has good decaf, like, really good decaf.  They also have great tea and the most amazing donuts, which happen to be vegan. Win win win.<//Review>< Rate>

<Review>I stopped by here on Christmas Eve because I was in desperate need for some caffeine. I was very grateful that it was open, but even more so to be greeted by friendly staff. Even though they were about to close, they made one of the best lattes I have ever had! They have some special lattes that are very unique and so soothing. If this place was closer to me, I would come here all the time!</Review>< user>

< Review>
Best coffee is the Bay Area. I travel from Oakland to get this coffee. The staff works hard to connect with community and customers. Always a very pleasant conversation and wonderful local art on display. I usually get Turkish Cortado, a red eye or short drip but everything including the teas are fantastic. A wonderful Cafe... on par with European caffes. No joke.</Review>

My go-to cafe. The lavender latte is phenomenal, especially cold, as is the clove latte or cardamom latte. The best thing about the cafe, though, is their mexican hot chocolate - rich, spicy, and not too sweet. If you don't like overly sweet drinks, this places makes it da bomb. As someone who can't have dairy, I also appreciate that they don't charge extra for non-vegan drinks.

I've been here at various times and the quality of the drinks does vary by the barista. If you want quality drinks, go on a weekday afternoon - there's a barista with a pixie cut on Wednesdays, for instance (sorry, I don't know your name!) and her drinks are 1000% better than the others.< /text>

This is a wonderful vegan-friendly cafe. The donuts are from Pepples Donut Farm. There are a few sidewalk tables. The staff and customers are very friendly, and there's a wonderful neighborhood vibe.< /text>

<text>Funky little neighborhood place halfway between the beer garden and the natural food store, so as you might expect a bit pricey. Decor not much better than a laundromat's, but good coffee and lots of other chic beverages, plus pastries, including vegan doughnuts and yam muffins--yes, that kind of place.

<text>I went there twice in one day. They serve oat milk if you are looking for an alternative milk option. Delicious chai latte and the lavendar late is to die for. I love the texture of the vegan donuts. Sometimes they have live music. Just a very interesting place and friendly service.<//text>< pics>

I love this place and frequent here often. The coffee is some of the best I've had in the Bay Area, I prefer the Gilman blend, but all are really good and they make a great Americano.</text>

Best cappuccino I know of. The biggest problem is that whenever I go anywhere else I'm disappointed in comparison with this kick ass dark roast.</Review>< Pics>

My favourite coffee shop in Berkeley. Chill vibes, great coffee, and tasty donuts. I would recommend any that are chocolate or citrus flavoured; they are the best.

The Turkish Cortado and maple oat cappucino are my very drinks. Great stop on the Greenway and walking distance from cedar-rose park.< /Text>

<Text>So I wanted to try Donut Farm🍩. Turns out this is a coffee shop☕️ that gets these donuts delivered to their shop from Donut Farm. Regardless, I got to try Donut Farm, which was great. It’s way to expensive though. 6 donuts for $16?!?😱😡😱 That’s more than $2 for one donut!!! You’d think vegan would be cheaper. Also, all these donuts have the same bottoms. The only difference is the frosting on top. The green matcha one is really gross🤮. But the early Grey lavender one is so good🤤!!! I’d say three of them were good (lavender, coconut, salted caramel). The other 3 were ok (orange, Mexican hot chocolate, and matcha). What I love about the donuts is that they have a really good crunch and it is SO AMAZING. They seem
More crumbly than normal donuts and less sweet tasting. I really like them overall. I’d give them a 3.7 stars if that was a choice.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I highly recommend this place for coffee and donuts! Excellent soy cap and Mexican mocha that was pleasantly not so sweet. The peeples vegan donuts are amazing flavors and excellent quality, even a candycap mushroom flavor! Maybe my fav coffee shop now.</text>

Sadly one of the few places where the baristas actually know something about their coffee. Delightful discussions and open to some custom drinks. Coffee roast dates are written  on the bag! Yay. In addition to selling whole beans they sell a variety of coffee making products (filters, pourovers, etc). Only 4 tables though, and one of them is outside.<//Review>

<review>TL;DR: good coffee, nice pastries, but there's that one rude barista who doesn't understand how to be a good neighbor to the other businesses on the street or how to be considerate of the customer's needs. A real shame.

PROS: very nice coffee, knowledgeable baristas. I'm not much of a pastry eater, but the couple of times I've tried one, it was quite good- especially the Yam Rolls. Most of the baristas are very cool people.

CONS: just the one, really, but it's kinda pissing me off. So, I've been a semi-regular at this cafe for a few months, went there maybe twice a week. I work online in cafes, and I make a point of buying a couple drinks each time and tip to contribute. I never had anyone at this shop give me a sense that I'd overstayed my welcome. They claimed to not have a bathroom, and told me I should walk down the street to the market. Since I don't feel right using a business's bathroom without buying something, and since Coffee Conscious only has pastries to eat anyways, I'd generally pick up lunch. Suddenly today, I was told not to eat outside food in the shop.

I was a barista for years, and I get that this is generally a no-no. But being that they were sending people to another business to use the bathroom, I figured it was reasonable to grab something. In the course of the conversation about this, the barista said something about the shop being small, basically implying that they're not cool with "campers." Fine, I get that too. But here's the thing- there was NOBODY else sitting when I arrived, and the cafe wasn't full in the whole time I was there. Also, there are some regulars who come in every day and take up basically half of the place. I like regulars, and I like supporting local businesses. But when they're all but throwing folks out on the one hand, and shmoozing others who are going to stay just as long on the other hand, it seems a little hypocritical.

Also hypocritical- they DO have a bathroom, and I've seen friends of the baristas using it. They've got to set the rules, I understand that, but when they make people needing a bathroom another business's problem (and BTW, it's a medical issue for some), it's not right for them to also complain about you supporting that business. And if you want to keep people moving through, don't selectively enforce that. Support local businesses- all of them. I'll be at Royal Ground on Solano.</review><Gmap_id>0x80857ec9caf33e17:0x3de8bd771a1d44c< /Gmap_id>< username>

Good food and great outdoor seating. More than the food,  I love the people working there. They are so sweet, from the cashier to the servers. My fave one is the young lady with a strong Spanish accent. She's so friendly and professional. Will eat there again just so I can give her a tip.</text>

My partner and I absolutely LOVED the pizza and cheesy bread we got here a couple of days ago. We had been hiking all week and needed some calories, and saw this place as we were heading back to our campsite. We were SO impressed with our meal. It was such wonderfully-made pizza (we got the 3-cheese with red sauce), and the cheesy breadsticks were freaking amazing! Plus, the service! Everyone was so super friendly!!! We love Parkside Pizza and will remember it fondly. :)<//text>

<Review>This pizza is absolutely delicious. I am a really, really picky pizza guy from NY and usually end up disappointed. Not here. It was so good we got it for dinner both nights lol. One of the nights they got the order wrong and fixed it right away. Go here, you won’t  regret it.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

In search of cheap eats after a long day of hiking we found this joint.

The pizza is not great:
-The cheese has a plastic like consistency which will try to choke you.
-The little sauce I could find lacked aroma and taste.
-The redeeming quality of this pizza was the outer crust which was airy with a nice crunch.<//text>

We got to the hotel next door late and found out that the power was out. We had not prepared to pay with cash and were all hungry.

After scrounging together everything we had, we were like twenty cents short. The woman seeking the counter said something like "no problem, we're all in this together."

Seriously, where do you find such amazing service and people these days? I will definitely babe a point to return to Parkside Pizza next time I'm in town.

Oh, and the pizza was awesome too!</review>

Great American style pizza. We forgot our backpack in the place and they were so kind and dropped it off at the hotel lobby next door, so we were able to pick it up the next morning. Thank you!< /review>

The best pizza I've tasted in my life in 2013.

I stayed at the lodge nearby with a Groupon and after a short hike we bussed back. It was a chilly December evening when we walked in for a Pizza and submitted our orders.

It was so delicious that it was unbelievable. All four of us were confused at something so good. We attributed it to the hike but ordered another pizza to test our theory. It was just as delicious despite our stomach's bursting.

We ate there every evening for the remainder of our two night stay. I write this review because I had the hardest time finding "Pizza place in Yosemite" and now that I finally found it I can look back on this review for my next visit to Yosemite.< /text>

< Review>
Simply said: worst pizza I ever had. Too expensive, a ton of „cheese“ ( I don’t know what this white sticky stuff is, definitely nothing s/o in Europe would call cheese). Ingredients spread over the pizza w/o even a second of giving it a sincere try. Place not really clean, although close to a NP trash is all over the place outside. At least the pizza was hot. All in all: they want your money. That’s it.< /Review>

The pizza and the service were great at this little pizza place just outside of the entrance to Yosemite. We stayed at the Blue Butterfly Inn tucked away on the river behind the property of the more expansive lodge. Nice to have the option of bringing pizza back to the Inn to eat or eat at Parkside, which we did. It's pretty unassuming, which we liked: you stand in line to order a pizza, find a table to sit at, and they bring it to you. The line was long, but the pizza came out quickly, and the service is attentive and friendly - well worth waiting in line! The crust was cooked just right and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Eat outside, if you can - the weather on the evening we were there was heavenly. The inside has several tables in it, but the atmosphere outside is much better.<//Text>

< review>
Yosemite could really use some decent food options. There's really nothing good in the area.

This looked to have the best Yelp reviews I could find so we came here the first night.

We got a large pizza, half chicken alfredo and half chicken cordon blue. On the positive side, the crust was way better than I expected. I really enjoyed it. The pizza itself was dry though. I couldn't taste any sauce and you would think alfredo and ranch would be noticable flavors. I did like the chicken cordon blue slightly more.

A large was plenty for two people. We ended up not eating it all since we didn't really like it.

We found a sandwich shop in Yosemite Valley (Degnans Kitchen) with free wifi that was better, so we didn't come back here.<//review>

<text>Where's the sauce? The pizza was more like a cheesy bread than a pizza. But it was still good and convenient. Luckily I had some marinara sauce at the house. We walked up and found was ready in the 15 mins they promised. Also they cut it bad.< /text>< pics>

After one bite of the pizza I knew it was horrible, tasteless, the crust was way too overcooked and black in spots,  quite possibly the worst pizza I've ever had.  I was starving so I ate a few pieces,  but if given the choice between the two I'd rather eat the butt end of a skunk!  Do not go here!<//text>< pictures>

The pizza is pretty good, but the beer and wine selection is limited. It is however, one of the few places to get anything to eat within about a 30 minute drive. It's where we usually eat while staying at the Blue Butterfly Inn next door.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Expensive and not very delicate with the ingredients. Frozen dough pizza, a shame because for the price they could be made on the spot. Attention good food too normal for the price.

(Translated by Google) Pizza without taste and far too much cheese. In addition, with $ 18 as a self-pickup exaggeratedly expensive. Better to eat yourself in the hotel (shop at Wal Mart beforehand)

This place over charged me today, made a skimpy pizza and it's not the 1st time. The employee who rang me up had no mask on. When I called with my discontent he just wanted to talk over me and would not even give me his name. Not helpful at all and though this is my neighborhood pizza I will not return. What a jerk!!! I feel over charged and cheated.< /Text>

The people working there were great so certainly the people are not an issue. The way the pizza tastes though... I am very particular because i usually make my own pizza from scratch, but every time i get pizza from papa murphys the dough just doesnt taste right and the sauce seems too watery and unseasoned and the toppings lack flavors im used to. My friend likes these pizzas, but for me it just isnt for me.</review>

<user_id>100779454044239823758<//user_id><Time>1537394315529</Time><text>This location ripped us off. They said they honor $10 Tuesdays over the phone, but when my fiance went to pick them up, they said they wouldn't honor the deal. He was frazzled and paid for it anyway. I was furious, called corporate, and they assured me they'd return the overcharge. Nothing has happened yet and it's been a few weeks. The Madison and Garfield location is much better. The food appears fresher and the place smells cleaner than this location. I won't be eating at Papa Murphy's if they don't refund the theft from this location, but either way, I'm steering clear of this location from here on out.

UPDATE: After dealing with corporate, I only received one response to my compliant in the form of an insulting and rude email from this store's manager. As a result, we don't spend a penny at any Papa Murphy's anymore. There's no accountability, this store could overcharge your card and nobody in corporate will care. But if you like Papa Murphy's, there's a way better location 2 blocks away, food is fresher too.</text><gmapID>0x809ade4972e34f09:0x5f4c154d90839a8e<//gmapID>< Response>

< Review>
Ordered a pizza 4 hours in advance and found out it hadn't even been made yet. No apology from the lady behind the counter.  I stood there and waited as they made my pizza.  I have family waiting on me. Really took any level of convenience out of picking up.  That is why I prefer delivery.</Review>

<text>This place is terrible the staff is slow rude and very unorganized.  It took them an hour to prepare one Pizza that isn't even cooked I still have to take it home and cook it.  I asked for some type of compensation such  a soda or something and they said no they just let me sit there.  I was very unhappy that evening don't see myself going back there ever... If you have more time then average person then by all means go here but if it's an after-work trying to get home quick bite this is going to slow you down and ruin your life.<//text><Rate>1< /Rate><name>LaShanda daniels< /name>< time>

Service was poor to nonexistent.  I came in with gift certs that have already been paid for.  They argued with me and refused to take them and refused to call the manager to clarify.  I went to the other store on Greenback and Hazel, they took the certs as cash, (as they should) without question, and were very friendly and apologetic.<//text>

Overall, it was good. I dropped in because I was in the area. I was assessed with different areas of concerns and adjustment techniques were different. I will more than likely stick to my original location.<//Text>

I really enjoy my visits because I feel so much relief after I go. I love that I can use my membership nationwide since I travel to California regularly. Dr. Harris at the metrocenter location in Phoenix, AZ is wonderful. I was also seen in Rancho Cucamonga and the Dr there was also wonderful and a very nice guy. I wish I caught his name. Definitely recommend the joint as it’s affordable and accessible!<//Review>

<Text>I've been going there for years.   I was very reluctant at first especially to have my neck adjusted but I've never had a problem.  I live with constant pain and tightness due to arthritis. Getting adjusted regularly has helped me tremendously. A special thank you to Dr. Gentry!  I have also been to other locations I've never had a problem. Staff is always friendly and professional and accommodating. I highly recommend them.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Even though I have my regular chiropractor, I’ve here several times on a Saturday when my neck is really bad. For me its worth the extra cost because I feel so much better thru the weekend.
The chiropractor always does a great job. The front desk person is always very nice.<//Review>

<Time>1616110239154< /Time><text>Terrible customer service. Make sure what did you sign with them. I gave them a trial last November after my horrible headache.  I was thinking I signed a month trial. I stopped going there after a month because did not see any difference. I just realize since than they have been charging monthly fee for membership. I paid 4 months fee without any service. When I contacted them. They said no refund because I signed automatically membership. I supposed to sign cancellation. No other solution or asking why I would not want to continue? Just telling me make sure you come and sign cancellation .They do not even follow patients if they feel better or happy with service just charging bills.<//text>< user>

{'time': 1616441894163, 'text': 'We regret any misunderstanding about your plan. We work very hard to ensure that our staff clearly explains all of the policies to our patients in order to avoid a situation such as this.\n\nPer our membership agreement, your plan has a 2 month minimum that will continue month to month until you request cancellation and turn in the proper form. This is necessary due to the medical nature of our account.\n\nPatients who elect to enroll with one of our money saving plans have those procedures explained verbally, and the main points are highlighted and initialed by the patient point by point, ensuring that they understand and agree to all points of the plan.\n\nWith that being said, we continually strive for great customer service, and we will work to ensure that we are being transparent with our plans which allow us to provide our care for a very discounted rate (only $79 a month for 4 adjustments). Please reach out so that we can address your concerns. Thank you.\n\nBest in Health,\nThe Joint Chiropractic'}</Resp>

<Review>I've been going to "The Joint' now for almost a year and I can say that all though the all have been good this location in Rancho Cucamonga has the best 2 chiropractors that I have seen. I drive a little out of my way on the way home to specially go to this location for these 2 chiropractors.</Review>< user>

Stopped in on our way to Irvine from Las Vegas and was in so much pain I could barely move my shoulder and arm and got the pleasure of making Dr. Gentry's acquaintance. He was thorough with a technique on point at this Joint!! I'm still in a bit of pain which he advised I would be but already feeling a bit of relief. Thanks so much Dr. Gentry - keep up the stellar work!<//text>

<Text>Wasted my time coming down there after I told the lady on the phone that I had an accident over 2 years ago. When I came in and she said she couldn't treat at me.  Could have easily saved me a trip down there by just saying on the phone what she told me in person.  If they can't perform a simple task over the phone I question whether they can actually do any other job.</Text>< username>

<review>You guys have mediocre chiropractors who just listen for the crack and don’t actually adjust you where you need it. You take money from people during a pandemic and then say there was nothing that could’ve been done. I am high risk and stopped coming after the shut down (which apparently didn’t matter) and that was the time our visits ended. We’re out $200 because you guys could care less about the safety of your “clients” and would rather take their hard earned money during a hard time. This place sucks. Find a real chiropractor.<//review>< Pictures>

I love the convenience of a walk in basis which is what works for my lifestyle. The doctors are great at what they do and the staff is friendly. The front desk staff are friendly and welcoming. Dr.  Smith and Dr. Tolbert are amazing. The level of ability and professionalism is remarkable. There is rarely a wait of more than 10 minutes during the week day and roughly 20-30 minutes on the weekend, and even that is rare.  The entire staff treats you like you are important, they remember your name and details you have shared about your life. They truly care and it shows. I  highly recommend.< /Review>

I love The Joint! For less than the cost of my insurance co-pay per visit, I can get weekly adjustments. The doctors and staff are friendly and cheerful. I get in and out quickly and the doctor on that day, listens to which area of my body is acting up and tailors the adjustment accordingly.</Text>

Easy place to go for a quick adjustment.  Usually there is no wait.  To get the best deal you must purchase a 10 visit or more package.  It works out if you go once a month.  You need to make sure you are telling bugging you.  If you do not speak up they will just do a general adjustment</Review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Dr. Smith is awesome! I was in a car accident in 2007 and started seeing a chiropractor in Norman, OK 2012-2016. I started going to The Joint about a year ago. I get tension headaches really bad at the base of my skull and NOTHING helps but chiropractic. Most techniques don’t work so Dr. Smith has to use a special technique that no other Chiro has used on me but it is immediate relief as soon as he does it.< /Text>< username>

Dr Rosie is the best chiropractor I have had the pleasure of being adjusted by. She is not rough or forceful but every place she adjusts me seems to sooth not only my joints but my nerves and muscles as well. She clearly puts a lot of thought in her approach of each individuals treatment. I love watching her adjust my mom because I sense her compassion and genuine care in how she takes care of my mom. Tara the receptionist always greets us enthusiasticly is quick to inform us of the most cost effective offers they have available. The facilities are always clean and have a good atmosphere. I look forward to going here and always come away feeling encouraged emotionally and physically.< /Text>

<text>The Joint is one of the best offices I’ve ever been too! Such a friendly staff and the Doctors are miracle workers. Dr. Tolbert is my personal favorite doctor at The Joint because he takes the time to remember what is ailing you, and really helps to make sure it is fixed before you leave. If you are considering going to a chiropractor, come here !<//text>< pics>

<Review>Awesome staff and doctors. Very friendly and actually try to get to know their patients. Tara, at the front desk, always welcomes you in with a big smile. I've been adjusted by few doctors at this location. All gave good adjustments, but Dr. Blake is my favorite.</Review><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I went to this place with the intentions of getting some relief. Filled out the paperwork rated my severity and where on my body the pain was. The doctor and this place was a joke. He would not even attempt to adjust me. Future reference: do not put a pain level of 10 they will not touch you.</Review>

The experience was great, I like that de Garcia took his time to talk to me about my lower back issues and I think her name was Tara she was the lady at the front she was nice all though people (customers) have ZERO patience she dealt with it very well, I think customers need to be nicer. The joint did wonders for my back I would recommend<//text>

<Text>Walked in to recieve more information about their package options as we were referred to by a friend. We walked in and were not greeted. I asked the receptionist what the packages consisted of, her first words to my colleague and I were "it's cash only". When my colleague said, "OK? What are the services you offer?" She said in an annoyed tone, "it's basic chiropractic services. They like jump on your back. And like crack your neck." I then asked her what the services meant and she looked annoyed and pointed to the service menu.  My colleague looked at me and asked that we leave.  Please coach your front office staff on how to properly sell your services and most importantly how to engage properly with potential paying customers.  Also, we find it very offensive when the first words that come out of your paid staff is not a greeting, instead a demand of preferred payment. By the way, they only take cash.

<review>Once the doctor determined I wouldn’t be picking up a multi-visit contract, he told me I was wasting my time and dismissed me, untreated and still in pain. I have had substantial, long-term relief from one treatment before, but apparently that didn’t suit him. I went through a lot of discomfort to get here, all for nothing. I can’t believe anyone in his field would do this.<//review><user>108654100892490514308< /user></record>

Location on Day creek in Rancho Cucamonga.  I went there twice in one day and got put off the first time and the second time.  first time I went there I was told to come back at 2:30 because im a new patient and they need more time than 20 minutes.  We go to lunch from 2 to 230.  I come back at 3:05 and I'm told sorry come back at four because we need a coordinator here with you.  this is not professional.  Waste of time and mileage.< /Text>

Great place to kick back, drink and chill while listening to a range of punk, rockabilly and metal.

Don’t be mistaken, this is a DIVE bar and it’s a great one! It’s been years since coming here last but love it every time. Even during COVID they’ve made it work and the outdoor seating is lively and safe.

If you like strong drinks and good music come here.< /Text>< rating>

<Review>This was suuuper cool. The food is bomb and the drinks are strong! The reason I didn't give 5 starts is because the waiter we had was rude and didn't pay much attention to our table. The bartender and cook were great with us so thank you for making our experience great!<//Review><userid>101326219083456118808< /userid>< name>

<review>Best place we have ever tried on a whim after a trip to Japan Town. It seems like a hole in the wall place in the city, but now we still can't forget. Very thorough on COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions to maintain safety throughout. Given the atmosphere, it felt very designated to a certain crowd, but the service was phenomenal with open arms. Oh gosh, the food!! I just had a grilled cheese and just that has me craving more! The fries are to die for!! I don't know what they use to season their food, but it's amazing! We each saved this spot in our map for a future visit, I tell everyone I know making a trip to SF, we are coming back again Zeitgeist! We are going to make sure you guys maintain a good business traffic flow! Love the merch! You are amazing!!< /review>< rating>

Nice outdoor space. Good drinks. Friendly service. You need to buy food with drinks but they have small plates if you are not hungry. They are careful about COVID regulations.<//Text>

<review>I really appreciate how Covid cautious they are. However, I felt that turned into an excuse for staff to be rude and target people. They say dogs are fine but our waiter refused to be anywhere near ours and threatened to kick us out if we didn’t further shorten her leash. Decent alcohol selection but not worth the hostile staff.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808f7e20423dcf53:0x95306ba1a91f0acd< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
Used to enjoy going there for their beer selection. Yes COVID times are tough, yes it’s even tougher on the service industry and restaurants and bars. But that doesn’t justify flat out rude behavior to your patrons, who are trying to support you during these tough times.</Review>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>Just alright. Greeted by a very unwelcoming bartender and all the staff felt really uptight. All their rules assume you're there to make trouble. Maybe that was the clientele pre-pandemic, but not now. The menu was extremely limited. Might go back once things open up more, but today it felt like we spent way too much money for something very mediocre.<//Text>< pics>

Pro: Nice beer and liquor combos, food is great.

Con: The folks at Zeitgeist seem to be under the impression that COVID-restrictions are a free pass to be massively rude to patrons, even when the "transgressions" have nothing to do with social distancing or ensuring that the area is safe for all. My wife and I were seated before our friend arrived. When he arrived a few minutes later, there was no one at the entrance to show his ID, so he saw us and walked backed to meet us.

Then in a move that was as bizarre as it was rude, the manager/host came over and berated me and my wife for not following his specific instructions to tell.my friend that he had to show his ID before he came back to meet us. Now apart from the fact that my friend immediately produced his ID, and that it is not the responsibility of the patrons to hunt down staff to show their ID, and that the entire situation could have easily been resolved without him being massively rude to us, it was just awkward. We are all adults, and to belittled by some guy because we did not follow his explicit instructions on how my friend should do his job was just odd.

So in closing... go to Standard Deviant on 14th street. Not as many seats, but at the very least you don't get belittled my and dude who looks like a scruffy Jeff Goldblum .< /text>

This place is lit! You have so many options and the sausages are actually tasty and fresh! In combination with the other ingredients, it makes a perfect snack! The fried Oreo desert is bomb! Best combo for food and desert. Get it for sure if you go to this place. You won't be disappointed!<//Text>

I don't know which I liked better the hot dog or the dirty corn, they were both perfect. There's a bathroom in the back which is always a plus and service was fast.</Text>< pictures>

Very rude crew, especially the front door host! Too much arrogance without any reason. The beer options are standard and food choices are limited. The ambience and place is just ok. Had seen many good reviews but  recent reviews on yelp are bad and I agree. I think the staff needs training on how to deal with customers.</text>

Super rude waiter that even my friends who have been here a couple of times recognized. This place is great except there is one guy who is about 40 years old who is the rudest waiter I’ve ever met. This place should fire him because all he does is offend customers. He yelled at my friend for not being able to find the bathroom— as if it’s her fault that she didn’t know where the bathroom was when it was her first time here.</review>

<Time>1554302868221< /Time><Text>It's been years since I've been to a bar like this, and I enjoyed every minute of it. It reminds me of the kinds of punk bars I would hang out in. This place has cool bartenders, pinball machines, and a great variety of draft beers. They also have a food menu (burgers, brats, etc.), but I didn't get a chance to try their stuff. I love this place and can't wait to come back.<//Text></record>

The amount of rules they have for patrons would suggest employees abide by some great moral code. Few things can be farther from the truth.

A no frills place with a large patio to smoke, if you're into that.

Great place for day drinking tho.</review>

This is a great bar for sunny days in the city. They have a huge back patio area, and it's always a great time. It is a cash only bar and even though there is an ATM, I recommend bringing your own cash. Wide selection of beers, decent food, fantastic atmosphere and good crowds.< /text>

I’ve been going to this place for the past 3 years and used to love it. Unfortunately our last experience was very bad.

-35min wait to get in ( that’s ok we were expecting it due to the pandemic)
-a quart of beer is now $15.5
-we ordered two baskets of fries ($26 total). It states that each basket serves 4-5 people. Unfortunately, it was smaller that the small $5 portion they used to serve. Each person had less than 5 fries. (We where 9)

We talked to one of the employee just to understand if there had been a mistake. The employee was very rude and did not apologize.

After spending $160 + $30 tip we really felt like we got roped off.

Very sad to see what this place has become. Maybe they got new managent and I hope they will fix it.

We talked with some of our table neighbors and they were all pretty disappointed..< /text>

While I understand the 1 hour time limit, we waited patiently outside for 30 minutes, once we sat at our table we spent 23 minutes with 1 drink and food before we were told to leave. I debated the time with our server while looking at several tables who had been then before we arrived. We even showed the credit card receipt for our first order and our uber timestamp of when we arrived both lining up to our timeframe. I appreciate what they are trying to do but felt like we were rushed out for parties of 6.... 7 Year patron will most likely no be returning anytime soon.</review>

Really great beer selection. Back patio is huge but fills up fast on most nights so get there early if you've got a group. Food is pretty solid for bar food, I usually get the patty melt. Fantastic staff. My go to SF dive.<//Text>

Great little punk bar that occasionally plays some good metal music as well. Friendly staff (hi Joe at the door!) and killer Bloody Mary's. And the burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches are great too. There's a beer garden space out back, a pool table in the room where you order food and lots of good local beer to order. But remember, they're CASH ONLY so hit an ATM on the way over.< /review>

Dive bars are not my favorite, but if you're in the area and you love beer, then Zeitgeist is an easy, casual option. Three of us stopped in for beers and enjoyed them in the outside patio area. The weather was perfect that day, and we shared a big pitcher of draft beer which my husband selected from the bar. The patio was full of customers enjoying the afternoon with friends.< /Text>

Don't worry, you won't be able to hear a thing, as you'll be enjoying a wonderful and vast selection of beer from the bar inside. It's really the outside patio that shines as one of the best drinking experiences in San Francisco.<//review>< Pics>

The drinks are also super cheap which is a rare find in SF.
The service is quick and the staff are lovely. There's also good outdoor seating for hot summer days.
I'd for sure recommend this place< /review>< pics>

Most awesome bar in the whole of San Francisco. Like the town itself, it needs furnishing and cleaning up in most places, but this shabby charme really works. Prices are reasonable, the food really, really good, Smokers are welcome. Staff is working hard to keep waiting times at the bar to a minimum. Awesome Jukebox inside (Slayer, Motörhead, you name it)!</Review>

Generally rough around the edges but also on the forefront of excellent beer selection. The kitchen hours are at the whim of the cooks' attitude but when it's on they deliver every time. Perhaps best regarded for its expansive beer garden in the middle of a busy city. The most striking aspect of this place is its fierce democratization of its clientele. There are no class-based perks and everyone is equally welcome. A remarkable feat for a town that reflects economic inequality more so than most other  American cities.<//Review>< Pictures>

Unique and genuine atmosphere in a rapidly changing neighborhood. Great outdoor space for the when the weather is cooperating. Extensive beer menu. The staff might look intimidating but they're actually friendly and knowledgeable. Good bar food and clean bathrooms. It's a cash only bar but they have an ATM inside. Definitely plan on visiting again next time I'm in the mission.</Review>

Awesome cash-only beer bar. The beer selection is great and the prices are reasonable compared to most places in SF. When you go, know a few things:

1. The bartenders aren't going to wait for you to decide. When you get to the bar, know what you're going to order
2. You're not going to hear top-40 hits here. They play metal. And it's awesome
3. There's a great outdoor seating area but bring a jacket since it can get kinda chilly at night
4. Always tip the bar tenders. They work hard

It's a great spot in SF - enjoy!</text>

The wild boar is my go to sausage. So incredibly delicious with the wasabi ketchup. If you are lucky enough to get there early a grab a burger... THAT is where it's at. Served on these incredible onion buns. The burgers are a true game changer. Take that over to tornados.. Basically you're looking at a perfect day.<//Review>

This is a genuine beer with a solid outdoor space / beer garden. Extensive beer menu, CASH ONLY. I've never had food, but apparently good bar food and relatively clean bathrooms. Enjoy this remaining relic of the Mission.</Text>

Staff is completely disrespectful to customers, particularly at closure. Takes 10 or more minutes to get a drink. The patio doesnt make up for the awful service experience at this place, and it hasn't improved for a decade.</Text>

The drinks are cheap and the people are diverse (when i mean diverse I mean its mostly white people but from different backgrounds, I'm Asian but I enjoy coming here.) Good for groups if you can find a table at the right time. They got a pool table and serve really good burgers. Be warned tho, its cash only.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Zeitgeist philosophy: do what(ever) you want. Just don't let YOUR party off leash. As soon as your party starts partying on others' party, that's the moment that you become a liability and get kicked out. And let's be honest, who HASN'T gotten kicked out of Zeitgeist, anyway?

Re: bar staff - they're professional, courteous and curt (that's how they got to you already. No time for chit chat). They are used to madness and mayhem. Their being short and to the point is how they control the chaos. That's you. :)

Haters always gonna hate, but real crew gonna appreciate. Zeitgeist gets ALL THE STARS. Now be good, y'all.<//Review>

One of the best bars in America. No question. Generally rough around the edges but also on the forefront of excellent beer selection. The kitchen hours are at the whim of the cooks' attitude but when it's on they deliver every time. Perhaps best regarded for its expansive beer garden in the middle of a busy city. The most striking aspect of this place is its fierce democratization of its clientele. There are no class-based perks and everyone is equally welcome. A remarkable feat for a town that reflects economic inequality more so than most other  American cities.<//review>

Cool bar with an awesome patio garden inside. So essentially a beer garden.
When i was there on Saturday afternoon the place was full, and they were playing kind of metal rock. Not a fan myself but i addmit it fit the mood:)</Text>

CASH ONLY. I wasn't really prepared for that. The drinks were reasonably priced and they served pitchers which I'd s huge plus. They had a great selection of beers and they served some food as well. It was packed on a Sunday afternoon and it took a while to get a table outside. Very fun punk rock bar, great tunes ,great vibes, and great staff. I'm sure we will be back<//Review>

I really enjoyed the scene here. It's a hip dive bar without the creepers. I loved being able to sit outside and the fact that it was private. The bike rack is cool too for those who bike. The bathrooms were very clean which is a huge plus in my book. I also enjoyed staring at the elephants painted on the wall in the garden.

The bar has a wonderful selection of beer and some ciders. I am not a beer person so I had a cider. Pretty sure it was Blizzard or something like that. It was recommended by the bartender.

I would definitely come here again and recommend it.<//review>

One of my go to bars. If you want something fancy or boujee, go elsewhere. This bar is no frills with an excellent beer selection. The outside patio area is what really makes this place special. There are so few places you can hang outside with your friends over a good beer. The food here is super cheap and great for a quick bite when you're starting your night.</Review>

I love zeitgeist! This is a legit dive rock bar with great beers on tap. The garden area outside is awesome and I’ve shared a lot of fun drinks here with all kinds of friends.

Even as SF has changed with the tech people over the years, zeitgeist’s vibe has stayed true. Just a little more packed now. Highly recommended if the vibe you want is energy but in a hangout, have a beer with friends way.<//Text>

I love this place for mostly sentimental reasons, but they also have a great beer selection.  The real draw is the outdoor area out back.  It's just communal picnic tables but the atmosphere (mostly laughter and weed smoke) make it great.  You can also get basic bar food here which is nothing special, but reasonably priced.  Just don't forget to dress warm!<//Text>

Outdoor beer garden in the mission that has a lot of seating, and is sheltered from the wind. One of the few outdoor spots in SF that's not that cold! Large beer selection. Limited selection of bar food.

The service is not very friendly. Lots of seating, but can be hard to find a place to sit unless you get there early. I think there's a separate smoking section, but maybe not enforced, so it can be a little smoky. Communal picnic tables, clientele is hit or miss, sometimes friendly and sometimes douchey.<//review>

<Review>The Zeitgeist is the worst possible destination for civilized people. The rudeness of the bar staff pales in comparison to the animus exhibited by the kitchen staff. Photography is inexplicably prohibited. There is enough weed hiding in the cracks of the picnic tables to keep Snoop busy for the rest of his life. On a warm day, there's more hairy sideboob of every gender at Zeitgeist than the rest of North America combined< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< response>

This place is awesome! Just because they now call it a biergarten with craft beer, don't expect the staff to be fancy. If you want a great day of drinking outdoors go now. There is always entertainment, just look around.< /Text>

Cool dive bar if you are into metal music or heavy prog rock. Really nice patio and huge smokers section outside. It has more beers on tap than other fancier places and the prices are decent for SF. Food is tasty, but as unhealthy as bar food goes... but I didn't expect more.<//Review>

I love the Zeitgeist. The people who go there have changed a lot since I started going there, but don't blame the bar. It's still got a punk rock soul.< /text>

Been here a few times. Make sure you bring cash! They have a nice big patio, always can grab a seat somewhere. No matter what time of day they got you covered. You can get a well made spicy Bloody Mary in the morning or an amazing midnight burger for drunk munchies. The fry cook is even a little feisty, which makes it even better!< /Text>

Plenty of drink options, and the outdoor area is good for relaxing and having good conversations with friends. They have food food on site (typical German-influenced pub fare), which is pretty good. Drinks are reasonably priced. Would recommend.< /text>

Place sucks. Music they play is cool. The people that work here severely resent anyone who doesn't wear a punk or rock n roll costume (see also band t shirts and jeans). Their beer choice is ok.< /Review>

Here for a meal, ordered west coast burger for $11 plus fries $4. The burger tastes quite good. Beef patty was juicy added with cheese and caramelised onions. Perfect for lunch.<//Review>

One of my favorite places in the city, huge selection of local craft beers on tap as well as some from across the western states. Food from the kitchen is basic yet cheap and delicious. I recommend a grilled cheese half cheddar/half pepper jack with the house fries.< /Text>

This place has become scam. Main problem was being thrown out for having a small service dog outside. Cash only, $3.75 to withdraw. Signs and rules everywhere about how you can't take pictures, sit on tables etc... So much for being a rock n roll bar. Used to be cool tho.<//Review>

Biker bar, but somehow also feels safe and hip and welcoming simultaneously. How? No idea! Big beer garden, great beer selections, a grill offering some burgers and sausages. Pool table. Plenty of space. This place is a real SF standard.< /Text>

Many of my friends won't go here anymore because it is too busy but if you ever come on an off time it's such a great hang out spot with great music. I came on a weekday around 4pm and got my veggie burger and Roy Rogers right away. Love the outside patio.</Text>

Use to like this bar ALOT, came here for many years and always recommended it... most recent visit was a little taken back. Gentrification to the max and the Bar tender also a caucasian gentlemen several times over skipped me while waiting long periods of time and spending plenty of money... definitely a racist experience... being native to SF, it was VERY poor ordeal</review>

I've been to this place many times in the past 10 years. The crowd has changed a bit, but its still a very fun place to hang out, play a game a of pool, have a burger and sit in a bench outside. They have a good amount of beers and spirits. It's definitely a place I would go to again!</Text>

Zeitgeist is an interesting punk/metal bar with a great draft beer selection, decent food, and plenty of outdoor space to enjoy the weather. Definitely a place to end the night, but don't cause a scene. They have a reputation for kicking annoying customers out!< /text>

The staff here isn't terribly friendly, but I feel like that's party of the charm. The back patio is where it's at really. It's very comfortable and social, but be careful if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke.<//Review>

Best beer garden in SF. Lots of great craft beer on tap as well as cocktails. You never know what kind of debauchery is happening on the patio and that’s what makes it great. Cash only and some food options!</review>

A nice little hidden surprise when you walk through the back. Love the patio seating area & the punk metal music vibes. Fun with a big group if you can get a table<//review>

Zeitgeist is a cool dive bar. They have more than 20 beers on tap and a few bottles. They also have a small kitchen than does a solid burger and fries and even a grilled cheese. I definitely recommend coming here with a few friends to enjoy a few beers and some casual heavy metal< /text>

One of the best bars in the city. Metal themed biker bar with about 100 beers on tap and a beer garden out back. Cheap burgers and tots, too! Cash only!< /text>

<text>Zeitgeist is an interesting place. Some nights the music level is just right so you can really enjoy a good conversation and some beers with friends and other nights the music is so loud that you can hardly hear yourself think, mind you this is outside in the patio/garden area.  It easily accommodates large groups and you don't need to have any type of reservation so that's always a plus. Inside the bar is normally crowded so its loud with conversation. I feel like Zeitgeist almost needs a bigger space and all would be great. Still a fun place to hang with friends.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

Have been here just once, though I plan to catch up with an old friend there later today. Dive bar vibe of a good sort that reeks history and sports old signs and eclectic decor, including a red-topped pool table in an alcove. Dozens of beers and a large outdoor area with picnic tables. Burgers being grilled smelled great, though I didn't have one. Cash only, according to a sign on the front door.< /review>

Maybe i just haven't gone at the right time...but I wasn't that impressed. Yes the patio area does seem like it'd be fun during a nice day in the city, but the couple of times I've been there, it's been at night and pretty chilly outside. The bar inside is a total biker bar, which is fine, but just not  really my kind of place. I hear food is pretty good, but I haven't had a chance to try it. I may improve my rating once I'm able to go back and be there on a nice afternoon in the outdoor area.</Review>

So nice to have an outdoor-centric bar. Can get cold sometimes but occasionally they'll bring out the heaters. I had a burger from the kitchen and it wasn't mind-blowing or life-altering but it was still dang good.< /review>

Great beer selection, and they have a nice beer garden out back.  They don't allow pictures or I might post one.  They have dominoes with a board you can use so they don't fall through the picnic tables.  The grill is good.  They make burgers, garden burgers, grilled cheese and tomato, and awesome home fries.  Used to be mainly a motorcycle bar, and they still keep that vibe, but now very bicycle friendly.  They also have a pool table.< /Review>

Cash only, and it can get super crowded here. The beer selection is pretty good and the prices are not too steep for the city. You can get pitchers to share with your friends so you do not have to wait in line too many times to sit down and hang out.</Text>

Noisy, smoky, the bartenders are often surly. But that's all good. The cocktails are all doubles, and good by dive bar standards. This is a great place, if it's the kind of place you're looking for.< /Text>

I visited Zeitgeist for the first time the other night and I will definitely be returning soon. The beer garden out the back was big and lively - a rarity in San Francisco. The beer menu was vast and the service great. The food menu was also a bonus; the grilled cheese and tomato came with a nice portion of fried potatoes and satisfied those late night munchies. Although the music is not really my thing, it didn't detract from the experience.<//Review>

<review>Extensive beer selection and large outdoor seating area. Beware, the place can get super busy during peak times.

They don't serve french fries (the board even mentions this). ⛔🍟
The food selection is really quite limited especially for group-snacking type items. Your best bet is chips which are a bit overpriced. I recommend eating prior to coming or grabbing a drink before heading elsewhere.

Had a California lager. Good place to chill. Inside there is an open area to sit and talk. Might not be a good idea to go there during a cold chilly day.<//Text>

<Text>Like so many bars in the area, if you want to get a seat you should probably come early. The drinks here are large and in charge! They are pricey but you'll get you're money's worth! I had an amazing gin and tonic!

The outside patio area is huge! There are picnic benches to sit on and I believe there was a BBQ pit. The bathroom outside is a little weird but was much more spacious than the one inside.

The staff is friendly, but when you're busy it's hard to be personable. The decor was pretty eclectic but the vibe was fun!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>One of the very first bars I went to when I moved here.

One of the bars that has the widest variety of beers from all over the world. There is also a giant patio area with tons of picnic tables for hanging out with friends.

They also serve some pretty decently priced grub. Snag yourself a grilled cheese and a beer.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>I met some friends at Zeitgeist when I was in town... I love the laid-back rocker atmosphere and the outdoor seating. Perfect for relaxing with a beer after work or on the weekend.

< Review>
I would heavily recommend avoiding this place.
I drove from Chico CA with my girlfriend and her friends to Zeitgeist Bar. She had told us that this place was a great bar with a wonderful patio and pool table.
We walked in and I went to the bathroom.
I came out and met my girlfriend and friends at the door.
We were met by the doorman, (remember, I just walked from the bathroom to the door) and the group was being yelled at by the doorman with a simple, repetitive, statement; "No, get the f*** out"
I asked him what happened and was met with him and another male forcefully, and unexpectedly, shoving me out the door on to the street. I hadn't had a single drink and was given no explanation.
(I feel that I should mention that my back is not in the best shape unfortunately)
I spoke with my girlfriend and her friends and was informed that they had left to look for me since they weren't sure if I had walked outside. Apparently, if you leave the bar at all or are associated with anyone leaving the bar, you are no longer welcome.
We ended up walking to the Crafty Fox just down the street and explained the situation. We were told by the bar tender that it's extremely common to try and keep up their reputation.
What a way to run a bar in San Francisco.
In conclusion, save your money and go somewhere else like we did.
We enjoyed some steak and Mac and made positive memories instead :)< /Review>

Don't sit right under the speakers outside unless you want to yell at each other.  some pinball machines and a bar size pool table Plenty of locals love this place and it has been there forever.  A ton of craft beers etc.  I always see people with bloody mary's so maybe they are good.  They also have some OK food from the grill for about 10 bucks a plate.  Oh yeah, you can smoke weed in the corner and no one cares.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Grungy rock bar with plenty of atmosphere. Staff were great and very friendly, though you could tell they didn't take you too seriously if you don't look hard enough for them (you shouldn't judge by looks, lets just say I've lived plenty!). Great burgers, juicy and full of flavor. I would have preferred some crispy fries to the lumpy, tater-totesque potatoes offered but no big deal. Large beer selection was a  plus and good tunes throughout. Will definitely return for more!</Text>

Good selection of beers. Bartender was unnecessarily rude. Is that a hipster thing now? Food was decent. Over representation of men in their 40s and 50s. What's up with that?</Review>

This is a must for anyone who likes beer and happens to be visiting SF, the ultimate patio experience. I've spent many happy, tipsy hours sipping beer and chatting with old and new friends. Perfect place to end up after dinner or night out, you just want to stay and talk and watch the sun dip behind the hills.< /review>

<user_name>Farzad Sharif<//user_name><Text>The lure of Zeitgeist is ultimately a lack of better options for open air drinking in a wide, open space where you can smoke. Sure, some find it's crusty, punk rock ambience charming – and some times they're right. But even on that level they could execute so much better. Friendlier bartenders and more of them; higher quality food; a better sound system; and so on. 'Cash only' is a bummer, too.< /Text>< time>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Resp>None< /Resp><Text>A wonderfully roomy and quirky-trashy dive with large array of cheap beers, affordable kitchen serving spot-on burgers (veggie too), a sexy patio and last but not least a couple of pinball machines. Music selection ranges from new wave to punk, noise-rock and sometimes even some post- and math-rock. Bar staff is always nice (even on Saturday late nights) and the crowd is diverse, motley and good.

Visited while on an organizational trip, on a Sunday. Music was 🔥! The atmosphere was a perfect cap to a busy day. Going back during peak hours is a definite goal.< /text>

Don't come here if you don't know how to act in a bar. Cash only. Great beers. Intelligent staff who don't have time for your $&#%. Patio is clutch.<//review>

Zeitgeist is a good fun place to grab drinks and grub. They have a large selection of beer and alcahol. The food has always been very good. Not fancy, but very good. It probably tastes better due to the alcohol, but they don't seem to skimp and it feels well worth the inexpensive price tag for a burger, veggie burger, or whatever else they have on the menu. The bathrooms aren't great, but I've never had a problem when I'm there so I assume they keep them up fine which says a lot.<//Text>

My experience as okay considering the people in this place. The employees were great as as well as the locals and regulars. The usual new San Francisco crowd though is overpowering. These people water down the potential great atmosphere here.<//review>

<text>This is a DIVE bar and it's great. They have a huge selecton of draft beer and a great punk/biker atmosphere. The burgers and home fries are really good and really reasonable. If you like to hang with a rougher looking crowd (but all very chill) this is the place.< /text>< user_id>

<review>Probably wouldn't describe this place as a punk bar as it just seemed like a stylized dive bar with some hipsters. But the beer garden was really nice (on a warm day). Beer garden got packed and was super noisy (overpowering any freeway sounds possible) Lots of beer on tap and most important $4 grilled cheese with potatoes and pickles!!!!</review>< Rate>

<review>Unnecessarily dirty and surprisingly  pretentious. Bartender hasnt showered in 3 days and has wax build up on his "unique" 1920's moustache, is put off when you ask if the one TV in the stench filled place could be put on the nationally televised football game. Just put a sign on the door "We only serve caricatures here".</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Great patio seating and a cool atmosphere, perfect place to have a beer or whiskey with friends. That being said, it's cash only (they do have an ATM, but when it gets crowded it can take a while),  does get very crowded during peak times, bartenders are known for being rude and will refuse to make any kind of mixed drinks most of the time, but on a busy night they work to get drinks out quickly.< /review>

<Date>1550507953071< /Date><rate>2< /rate><text>This place has a great selection of beers. The only reason for the 2 star rate is because last time I was there I was taking a picture of the beer menu just because I'm a tourist and I wanted a great memory of it. One of the waiters shouted at me out loud "NO PICTURES" and pointed at a sign that says "no pictures". Well, if you have already been there you will notice that the whole ceiling and walls are covered with signs, and a sign that says "no pictures" is barely noticed amongst the others. He shouted so loud that every client in the bar looked at me. Well, I guess there several ways of saying something. He chose the rudest one. I feel very sorry for him. We were very good clients and I know this place is never gonna be our priority anymore.< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
Was walking from Hayes Valley trying to get to a bar and got caught by a red light. I noticed a skull on the door and thought why not? I was pretty surprised because even though it looked a bit like a dive from the outside -- and is CASH ONLY -- it has a really good selection of beers and is not at all a dive. It is just a fairly nice beer garden out back with a kind of divey inside. Totally laid back place (at lead mid afternoon during the week!) I would go back to. I was in town for business but texted my SF buddy who was out of town, and he was like "I love that place!" Definitely worth a trip if you are in the area.<//review>

Great beer selection. Cool atmosphere. People need to learn that while I don't care if they smoke, I don't smoke so they need to stay in their area. Staff could help with this a little.< /Text>

<text>Very loud. Kind of rude staff - we were looking for some friends in the crowd and were told to move twice. Back patio could be cool if it wasn't so loud and crowded and filled with smokers. It seemed the place was trying to be hip but ended up seeming like a biker bar with metal music. Cash only.</text>< Pics>

<Text>San Francisco has changed a lot recently, and I hadn't been here in a while, I was very happy to see that the Zeitgeist is still very much the way I remembered it. Good drinks, good crowds and many of the same lovely surly folks working the bar. Wouldn't have it any other way.</Text><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

The crowd here is pretty laid back, there's good beer, the well drinks are served in pint glasses, there's bar food and a pool table, and the backyard is pretty great.

My only hesitation is that the bar gets pretty packed on weekends and I'm not a huge fan of crowds -- but if you're looking for fun, showing friends around the city, or want to meet some new people, Zeitgeist is a pretty good bet!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Zeitgeist is a surly joint full of yuppies in punk clothes, cigarette smoke, and suspicious bartenders.  Patrons glare at you.  You glare back.  Sound fun?

The only redeeming quality of this place is it's big backyard area. But if you're looking for that atmosphere and are willing to make a small trek head over to El Rio, where the beers are cheaper and you get the backyard without the angst.< /text>

<review>This is one of the few beer gardens I've been able to find in the city.  I usually go straight for their bloody marys - they are potent but oh so good!  If the weather is decent (well, even if it's not) the beer garden will usually be packed Friday and Saturday evenings so come early to get yourself a spot on their large community tables.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Lots of variety of beers and a few good ciders as well. Live music was a nice touch to the environment. Picnic style benches are outside for general use by the beer garden patrons< /Review>< userid>

I had an empty cup of water, and an employee came up to me and asked me if we brought in alcohol. We told him no and he told us he didn't believe us. This was after buying a pitcher of beer and clearly drinking said beer. We did not do anything wrong and they still came and accused us of not following the rules. I am sorry for buying alcohol from your establishment???< /Text>

Went in with my wife (who is an immigrant) and ordered us a couple of cocktails. I complained when I caught the bartender watering down our drinks and some bald guy (probably a bouncer) came up and started calling her a "mail order bride." There are much better bars who deserve your money more than these douchebags.<//review>

This is a great place to go chill with some friends on a sunny day. It's festive with great beer and the way the outdoor section is configured, there's no wind so if they sun is out, it feel pretty warm. You can end up spending a ton of time there. My first year in SF, I held my birthday gathering here. There were tons of room for everyone to hangout and have a blast. Great for people watching and meeting!

The one thing about this place that makes me not want to be a super fan is the fact that I can't eat anything here. I don't eat beef or pork and I hear they have an amazing burger.< /Review>

<text>Two weeks ago my friend and I went here to find a poorly-trained trumpet player blurting out a terrible rendition of Jethro Tull's classic, "Thick as a Brick". Keep in mind this was the third time I'd encountered this man (who I believe is the owner's cousin). I asked him to stop playing so loud in my ear and when he wouldn't stop I informed him that I'd walked Bob Dylan on stage at Filmore in 1973, and that he was destroying my favorite Jethro Tull album. Shortly after that, this man (wouldn't tell me his name), beat me with a rubber fist until my eyes swelled shut.

Needless to say, after all of that AND being propositioned in the bathroom by an angry bald man.I will not return.

One of the waitresses had a tampon string hanging out of her jeans, too.</text></record></dataset><record>

Great Beer Selection and a HUGE Patio what more could you ask for on a Sunday Funday?  They also have a limited food offering with some pretty darn good burgers.  This is a great place to spend an afternoon with friends or grab a beer after a sporting event.  We usually go here after weeknight soccer games and share a pitcher of beer.<//text>

<review>I like to go in the corner past the bar where no one can see me on Friday nights and beat off under the table. Kind of a thing I've been doing for like 2 straight years and no one has caught me yet. Something tells me I wouldn't be kicked out but encouraged if discovered. Makes me diamonds. Still, I have to give it a 1/5 because I know this is a dangerous addiction and I have to be stopped although I'm too proud to actually quit my reign of terror outright. Someone of equal power must end my devious spree.< /review><name>Hugh Mungus<//name>< userid>

This is a hardcore bar, most are wearing dark clothes. They do have a lot of good beers on tap and a nice big outdoor patio. Appropriate to go to with a large crowd, but not if they're not into the possibility that Satan helped draught their brew.<//Text>

The barkeep with blue hair mouthed off a few benefactors while we were holding up to arrange our beverages. The bare bouncer was extremely forceful and fierce with different supporters who were not bringing about any issues. He threw a punch at one person since he said he didn't care for the way he was taking a gander at him. Our nourishment was frightful and we sat tight just about 2 hours for courses. Heaps of other great spots around there with MUCH better administration. STAY AWAY!<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Very rude and disrespectful.  The bartender with blue hair mouthed off several patrons while we were waiting to order our drinks.  The bald bouncer was very aggressive and confrontational with various patrons who were not causing any problems.  He threw a punch at one guy because he said he didn't like the way he was looking at him. Our food was terrible and we waited almost 2 hours for entrees. Lots of other good places in this area with MUCH better service.  STAY AWAY!</Review>

Cash only. Super dive-y bar with plenty of out door seating. Large selection of beer on tap as well as bottled. Pool table off to the side, by the food counter, which serves burgers and homefries. Patio seating is plenty, with many umbrellas for shade.<//review>

The bar is like so many others, small, dark and usually pretty dingy.  However the back patio/beer garden is why you come here.  With long wooden tables and a host of rowdy patrons, this is the place to go drink beer on a sunny day in the city.  The beer selection is great and the atmosphere out back is always fun.  Food is pretty hit or miss here if you're looking to eat but the beer is why you come.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Pandemic update: This bar that used to be my headquarters (I had been going there 3 times a week for 3 years before COVID hit) is now the shadow of its former self.
The reasons we would go there were:
-Broad choice of beers on tap (50+)
-Quick service, if you're thirsty you go to the bar and the waiters were the quickest of the West
-Allowed smoking, not many bars with outdoors allow that, Zeitgeist was famous for this
-Opened late, usually midnight on week days and 2AM on weekends

It was the best "dive" bar I had been to and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
Now if you go there:
-Very few beers on tap, no more pitchers!
-You have to wait for the waiters who take forever to notice you to take your order
-You are not allowed to smoke, not even vaping, despite being outdoors and socially distanced from other tables
-They close at 9PM

Some of those changes I can get due to COVID, some others are just this place losing its soul. Good luck and farewell<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Zeitgeist has an amazing selection of draft beers, an inside bar that feels like a hole-in-the wall where you can watch the Giants or Warriors on their single TV, a large outdoor beer garden, and some tasty grilled food. Oh, don't forget the decent juke box and old biker bar decor.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I walked in and the blue haired bartender was literally playing "A Birth of a Nation" and "Triumph of the Will" on a tablet at the bar talking about "White Power".  The bouncer also has "14:88" tattooed on his hand. I was mortified. The employees are literally Hitler. Avoid at all cost if you respect tolerance.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Note: I came here on a Friday night.

I think for the crowd it desires to cater to, Zeitgeist deserves 5 stars.

The bar boasts a large beer selection at very affordable prices! I grabbed a glass of sculpin and green flash west coast for $11.

Dress code is casual as is the atmosphere.

Spacious outdoor area with an interesting heavy-metal influenced playlist. Not exactly my music, but I enjoyed the experience!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808f7e20423dcf53:0x95306ba1a91f0acd</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>One of my favorite bars in San Francisco. Amazing patio where anything goes (no photos please) incredible beer selection, pool table, and generally good crowd. Can get hectic on sunny Saturdays, but its always a good time. The picnic table seating usually facilitates some interesting conversation between groups of strangers, and I've made more new friends at this bar because of it than anywhere else in SF. And its cheap! Word to the wise- don't order food after 10PM. The cook has been there a long, long time, and he doesn't want to make your drunk ass a grilled cheese. Wait for the tamale lady to show up!< /Text></record>

I love this place - it's one of the best dive bars in San Francisco.  They've got good drinks, a lot of beer, and fantastic grilled cheeses.  They also might have the best home fries I've had in the city.<//Text>

The best part is the outdoor patio, which is massive (smoking allowed). Zeitgeist is rough around the edges... like all of the edges are rough, but this is the appeal of that place. You don't go there on the first date or to hook up, you go there to hang out with friend, drink beer and smoke. It's damn awesome!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>There aren't many beer gardens in San Francisco and this one is definitely an institution. If it's sunny, go here. Keep your wits about you and put your phone away when ordering, though. The bartenders aren't the friendly sort. In fact, if the though of punk rock blaring and surly bartenders makes you angry... you probably want to skip Zeitgeist altogether.< /Text>< Pics>

SF standard for good beer and THE outdoor patio.  It can get crowded and noisy.  Famous for their Bloody Mary which is solid, but not the best I've ever had.< /text>

Despite my ratings, this locals-only haunt has the best backyard beer garden in the city.  A hipster joint, cold women serve warm beer with an attitude.  Lots of unique and specialty beers, along with a bbq and a full bar make this a destination where you can waste an afternoon in ultra-stereotypical SF-hipster fashion...<//review>

<Text>I went here to have a drink with a friend and his friends for his birthday. The patio area was a big open space with lots of benches for people to congregate and drink to their merriment.

The bar was lively on both inside and outside the premises, and is at a great location just a block away from Market and Valencia. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I could definitely see why people would go here for a drink or two (or three).< /Text><user_id>106208702453359226950</user_id><resp>None< /resp></record>

Massive beer selection and great outdoor seating.  It's a cool hangout and, even when crowded, doesn't feel terribly so.  Protip:  You can order beers through the outside window.  Line there is usually shorter than trying to get a bartender's attention at the bar.<//Text>

Great spot, excellent draught beer selection, food is good, not overly pricey throughout, the crowd is a mixed and trendy sort, smoking is allowed in the patio. Definitely recommend 5/7< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>Not what it once was, but maybe that is a good thing? Maybe not. Depends on your perspective. It used to be populated by curriers, show movies on the back wall in the patio through billows of pot smoke, and have decent food if you could wait for it. Now the crowd is more millennials than bikers. The beer selection remains awesome, and the outside patio is still a nice place to have a pint on a Summer day.< /Text>< user>

I hate to give this place such a low rating cuz it's such a cool space and historically it was always a great place 4 bikers and motorcycle Enthusiast but then it got taken over by the Hipster crowd and it's just gone down ever since not the fault of the establishment they can't control who comes to their place<//Text>

crazy fun spot.  came here after SF critical mass due to ability to lock up my bike indoors.  big outdoor patio for eating and carrying one. the bike racks out on the patio are clutch to hang up that trusty steed away from prying eyes and saws.. outdoor smoking area, beer garden type feel, lots of wanna bes just coming here for the scene tho..<//review>

I used to go here all the time when I lived on Valencia. I brought a large group of my Texas girlfriends here and the bartender educated us to the virtues of Fernet. This place is like your favorite dirty dive bar mixed with a German bier garten. Plenty of seating outside and fun people watching.</Text>

Found a hair in my sandwich and was treated with apathy and derision by staff who thought they were cool but in reality were rather unattractive and doofy (suppose in the hipster world thats cool). The crowd was average to below average and the food sucked, beyond the hair. In an area with so many great choices, why would anyone come here?</Text>

<Text>I liked Zeitgeist but I'm biased: I like beer. I used to think Zeitgeist got crowded but that was before I experienced the beer garden on Octavia. One good feature of Zeitgeist: there's and indoor AND an outdoor area. Tap takeover nights happen here, especially around SF Beer Week.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Lots of excellent beer on tap (we had the Moonlight Death and Taxes), a large outdoor beer garden, good music, and a skull-bunny on the door. All good.

The only downside? The outdoor beer garden hung under a steady pall of cigarette (and other) smoke, which made it hard for us to hang around for more than a single pint.

In many ways, a grittier, grungier version of the Ginger Man.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Super fun place to go out and get some late night drink and grub. Food takes a long time and the place is a non-conformist beer garden that looks like it was plucked from the East Village in NYC. Wear warm clothes when it's cold as most of it is outside.< /text>

<review>Vegans: Ask them to hold the worsteshire sauce and the horseradish (it has egg in it). That’ll make it 100% herbivore-friendly.

Ride a bike? Love pinball? Like cheap brewskies? Enjoy a solid outdoor space? Then Zeitgeist is for you. This no-nonesense bar is great for large parties on a hot summer day. Miss the tamale lady though.</text>

Picnic tables?
Heavy Metal?
Beer?
Kids, welcome to hipster summer camp.
Zeitgeist is hands down the best beer bar in the mission . It has loads of local brews and even some awesome ones straight from belgium. The bloody marys are also perfection.
The atmosphere outside is so fun. If you have a cigarette to spare you will make friends immediately.
They have a staunch anti pinata policy but other than that they are the best bar in the mission.
You can't have everything.</review>

The Zeitgeist was where lots of bicycle activists would meet up and plan things like the 5th year anniversary of Critical Mass or what we could do to get a bicycle lane on Valencia.

Today... Today, it has nothing of it's former glory. The beer is great, the decor is divy, and the service sucks, so at least it still retains its former charm. But you can't get into fights anymore without cops getting involved.< /review>< Time>

Bartenders are friendly enough, good beer selection, and good environment but please, please DON'T EVER ORDER FOOD THERE! EVER! After waiting in line for nearly thirty minutes to place my order, I finally get there, place my order and the very rude (fat, short-haired, pudgy) girl working behind the window doesn't give me my change back. When I tell her I haven't received my $13 in chance back, she becomes hostile and extremely rude and says that I left the window and implies im really drunk and thats why i wandered off....DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE DRINK! Bottom line is, the food is crap and so are the people who make it.  Rant over and please, for the love of God, someone get new and more friendly cooks back there....ones who wont act like complete bitches when the pressure becomes too much for them back there.<//Text>

< review>
I've been a bartender for over 9 years, and the only reason I've not served someone is because I didn't think it was safe for them to drink anymore. If I ever didn't serve someone because I personally didn't like them, that would be the only situation in which management would not have my back and make sure that person got served. The viral video shows that this place is run by scumbags that embrace bigoted ideology. Typically progressive double standards. This business should be ashamed.</review>

<date>1475561122468<//date><rating>1</rating><Text>okay, i Recently came to sf with A few friends to visit and we decided to stoP in this bar. while here, a group of men were discussing something political to themselves and the bartender and bouncer both started yelling at them and pushing them around. I believe they were talking about the upcoming presidential electioN. eventually they got pushed out the door.

i can't Believe any establishment In this day and age would do such a thing. so what if you don't share the same beLiefs as these guys, grow up and Learn to respect others.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Text>Came here on a team outing (a.k.a. day drinking) last week, where the lot of us proceeded to polish off a few pitchers of beer over the next few hours, while I was feeling rebellious and chose to nurse my double of rye instead.

While the drinks are pretty standard - don't expect any fancy cocktails here, a la Rickhouse or Zero Zero - the space is pretty neat. There's the usual indoor part of a dive bar, with the pool table and video games, and there's this nice outdoor patio area, replete with picnic tables and benches.

Unfortunately, not so much to my tastes, mostly due to me being more of the cocktail bar/lounge type, but partly since, not only was it too cold to be out in an area lacking heat lamps, but also because the patio was filled with smokers. But hey, if these don't bug you, or you're into the dive scene, Zeitgeist is probably worth checking out.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - While the front door has a single step that's easy to get up with some help, they also do have an accessible side entrance. Once inside, you have to deal with your usual bar height counters, but they have ramps elsewhere to get you in and out of the patio, should you so choose.

Bathroom - Accessible!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808f7e20423dcf53:0x95306ba1a91f0acd</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Once you make your way through the divey inside, there's a great outdoor biergarten that Zeitgeist has provided for you to enjoy their considerable selection of beers. This place has been getting quite a reputation as the cool place to go for a reasonably priced drink, and while it's not your only option for that sort of thing, it's a heavyweight in its class.< /Text>< Pics>

It's pretty much a Biergarten, done in a San Francisco style.  But not like a bunch of entrepreneurs trying to cash in tried to imagine what a San Francisco-Bavarian Fusion Biergarten would look like.  Nope, it's like an organic biker-cum-bicyclist bar with a great outdoor area, great beer, and a whole lot of privacy.  Also, Tamale Lady.<//text>

After being hassled in the toilets for turning down a request for oral sex from a heavy set, blue haired individual, we were again hassled at the bar for "wrong opinions" (can't remember the exact phrase that was used).
Basically, only come here if you have a very narrowly defined set of "acceptable opinions".
On our way out we were threatened by a Mr Sam Hyde with his friend Ben Garrison. They started talking nonsense about 'zyklon' or something; very strange experience. Maybe Zyklon was the bouncers name?
Either way, we won't be returning, the place has a a bit of a 'skin head' vibe if you understand my meaning.<//text>

Bar with too much hype. The large patio is great on a nice day and the beer selection is decent, but the staff was a bit rude and the (not so great) burgers took over an hour.< /review>

The beer selection is amazing. The burgers and homefries are always SO GOOD! The staff is friendly but not fake. If you don't feel comfortable then you probably should have a drink elsewhere. This isn't the place to be uptight. Let loose, but don't go crazy. I REALLY miss their collection of pinball games, but there's always pool. My 50something y/o bloodymary hating friend says Zeitgeist's blodymary is the best he's had in his life!< /Text>

This is a bar after a Detroiters heart minus the Wings. Beer selection might not be good enough for Portlanders. The vibe is an older dive, with lots of black shirts. Older punks, biker types, goths, and jaded burners. Some yuppies, but not many hipsters from what I've seen.<//text>

The locals are very weary of new comers so it's a bit uncomfortable, but I like the spot- love to shoot pool, drink micro brews, and there's an outdoor area too that's very nice!

Also good quick food that I grabbed as I entered!

I will dedefinitely go again ✳🎶👄</Text>

A prefect addition to the neighborhood and a much needed outdoor beer garden. This place is a blast. They'll give you a full other pitcher if they run out of your beer and they have quite the selection to try. Go with a group of friends and bring cash.</Review>

Rude bartenders (deliberately so), cash only, wide selection of drinks, good food, grumpy kitchen staff (deliberately so),  outdoor and indoor seating, outdoor community tables, loud hardcore music, smoking allowed outside, bicycle racks....One of my fav outdoor bars even with the attitude from the bar and kitchen staff...:)<//review>

Awesome gtfo, dive-y, laissez-faire attitude bar with diverse tap selection. Outdoor yard is great place to hang out and argue nonsensically about whatever politics, coffee, or gluten-free diet turns you on.<//Text>

I'm giving it a "1" for the dispicable way two Trump supporters were treated in your Bar.  When your Barmaid saw the two Customers in the Bar wearing "Make America Great Again" Shirts,  she asked them if they were serious?  When they said "yes" she said she wouldn't serve them.  After debating back and forth,  the Barmaid got "BOUNCERS" and the "BOUNCERS" Physically made them leave the Bar.  Its clear on the "VIDEO FOOTAGE"  the Bouncers Physically Assaulted the two Customers on the process.  ALL FOR WEARING A "Make America Great" slogan on a Shirt.  Your lucky it wasn't me your Barmaid or your Bouncers did that to.  I would have called 911 ASAP,  and an "Ethical" Lawyer with experience in "Federal Law"  would have been "sending you a "Letter".  In addition I would have pursued the possibility of Charges at your Bouncers.  You see I Voted for #PresidentTrump.  I'm also "Educated" as a Paralegal.  You see it's an untruth that #PresidentTrump Voters arn't Educated.  Shame on your Business for discriminating.  You did the same thing that Businesses in the Southern U.S. did during "JIM CROW."<//Review>

Came here to grab drinks with some friends.

I opted for the hard apple cider, which was decent, and I just hung out outside on the benches. Place was almost completely packed for a Saturday night around 11pm.

Cash only.</review>< Pictures>

Can you say dive bar? Can you say it louder than the Motorhead blasting in your ears? One of the most unique bars in the city, this place is great if you want to go relax with some friends and catch up. The Evil Twin beer by heretic is unparalleled by red ales. Check it out if you are looking for a beer garden on a warm(ish) day in SF.<//Review>

Ok Beer and ok food for the price. But expect to be talked to in a rude manner by the staff. That is both in the door, the bar and when you order food. Seriously, cheer up guys!</Review>

<Text>This bar is ran by bigots, homophobes, islamophobes, racists, sexists, xenophobes, facist and capitalists! Really bad customer service too! My partner and I were neglected by their staff. I guess it's a coincidence that we also happen to be POC's....</Text></record>

Well my wife's autistic son who happen to go out for a first time in a while(he doesn't have many friends) was just kicked out of this bar because a nasty skinhead bouncer did not like his presence there. Now he is in his room crying and hugging his lady body pillow since this skin head bouncer ruined his night. I tried offering him some chicken tendies and french fries (his favorite meal) but he just started to cry even more and smacked the plate out of my hands. I am a very popular bar goer and rater in the SAN FRAN area and I will advise everyone I know against going here again. The bigotry and privilege of this place is outrageous. Now I will try to comfort my wife's autistic son by offering him cookies and milk. If I could I would give this place a negative star. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COSTUMER AT ALL !!!! STAY AWAY !!!<//review>

<Review>The place was dirty. The Staff and even customer were a bunch of tumblr rejects and judgemental SJW cucks.  A couple people who I guess were regulars there treated my friend who is an Iraqi veteran suffering from PTSD very disrespectfully, because he wore a shirt with an American flag on it and i suppose that "triggered" them. They called him a racist for no reason trying to cause a scene, we said nothing to them, and the bouncers approached us and said we weren't welcome there and we had to leave.</Review>< Time>

Mission dive bar with an extensive beer selection and cheap cocktails. They also serve food and have a huge outside patio. Only drawback is its cash only. But they do have ATMs on site< /review>

Zeitgeist is a dive bar, but unlike most dive bars you've been to or will go to if you get around this place has very little appeal. A good selection of beer and only double tall drinks are what's what though. The pricing is really geared towards beer, the first sign of a dive bar. Second sign is the 1 and only pool table is trashed and supported on boards that could totally break with more than 6 on a board. Definitely creekage. Small groups of mixed groups buddle around corners like a college bar. No bums or degenerates roaming around, no biker's posted up, HH was not to be seen. Prices on the wall were odd, order and then find out. I like the patio, the lounging gardens and that's what saved this place for me.

To me "dive" is an endearing term of feeling free and doing what you want, no judgment from the other patrons, cheap drinks, but when you have clique's and unfriendly people, a thrashed location, a kitchen (dive bars may only have a stove and fryer). More pub than bar, but a low quality in any regard. Tiniest bathrooms I've been to in a while. Everyone dropping 4 stars must be on crack or know the bartenders because when you travel around the country you'll see that being your favorite local bar or where everyone knows you doesn't make it good.

2 bouncers at the door were unnecessary and brutish, actually they were no larger than me, probably trained in some deadly martial art, not scaring anyone guys, everyone's trained now a days. 3 bouncers on a dead Saturday, odd. You should know they're there, but not everywhere checking up on you. If it wasn't for the only selling doubles, decent beer prices and selection and the outdoor patio garden area this place is a 1 star. Barely managing a 3 because drinkers are my people.</Text>

Probably my favorite bar in the City since it's right by MUNI, never crowded enough that I don't have patio seating, and their beer selection is functionally as good as Toronado's. I was there last night and tried a coconut IPA, Big Leaf Maple, and an oatmeal porter.

One of the few places in the City that has Death n' Taxes on tap, so there's a solid option for all your dark beer lovers.

And all the beers are between $4 and $5, and during happy hour, it's all slightly discounted, so nice craft beers at rock bottom bar prices!

Props to the bouncer as well. I had left my ID at Burning Man, but I just explained it to him and he waved me through. #burnerproblems

Close enough to the Mission to stumble there for burritos or Indian food as well, so all your needs are met. And as Nique F. reminded me, Zeitgeist rolls out its own burgers and grilled cheese sammiches, so you can stay here for your vittles too.<//review>

Staff was rude and inconsiderate to my party, We were trying to order several things and wanted separate tabs, Bartender told us he couldn't bother with running cards again and refused to charge us to individuals, this also then included a standard gratuity%  Which we wanted to have removed, again he refused, told us to take it up with the credit card company if we didn't like, Then proceeded to bouncer our group out to make way for another party, even though we had booked till 5p, We won't be returning and discourage anyone from patronizing this nasty bar</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I like this brewery that dates back to 1979!
Inside it has a secret garden with spartan tables on which to sip beer and small dishes during the hottest hours. Suitable for groups because there is a lot of space.

(Translated by Google) Cool. A whole classic. The exquisite beer. The largest variety of beers I have ever seen. The IPAs, unbeatable. Mortar environment. The patio is delicious. The truth is that San Francisco never ceases to surprise me, you always find something. The only surprising thing is that they only admit almost, well, the only downside. For the rest, absolutely recommended, do not miss it. I was very pleasantly surprised to see an advertising poster for the mythical Spanish Bultaco.

(Original)
Genial. Todo un clásico. La cerveza exquisita. La mayor variedad de cervezas que he visto nunca. Las IPA, inmejorables. Ambiente de morteros. El patio es delicioso. La verdad es que San Francisco no deja d sorprenderme, siempre encuentras algo. Lo único sorprendente es que solo admiten casi, en fin, la única pega. Por lo demás, absolutamente recomendable, no os lo perdais. Me sorprendió muy agradablemente ver un cartel publicitario de la mítica Bultaco española.</Text>

<rate>4</rate><text>(Translated by Google) Cool alternative bar with an extensive beer selection.

You can only pay with cash. Opposite Zeitgeist is "Fred's Liquor". You can pin here.

In terms of music, metal and rock were mainly played. When we were there hip-hop was also played, Wu Tang Clan a.o.

It can get cold when you sit outside. Make sure you bring a jacket or vest.

(Original)
Toffe alternatieve bar met een uitgebreid bieraanbod.

Je kan er alleen met cash betalen. Tegenover Zeitgeist zit "Fred's Liquor". Hier kun je pinnen.

Qua muziek werd er vooral metal en rock gespeeld. Toen wij er waren werd er ook hip-hop gedraaid,Wu Tang Clan o.a.

Het kan wel koud worden als je buiten zit. Let er op dat je een jas of vest meeneemt.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>(Translated by Google) By far the most well-stocked pub. Has an impressive 53 varieties on tap. Bikers place. The place has a great history and has been The place for bikers. On the walls are a lot of pictures and paintings from many celebrities in mc sports and who have also been regulars at this pub. From Paris-Dakar to famous road racing drivers.
Is a must as a tourist and is a matter of course for local bikers.
The place has a mobile phone ban in the bar which makes the place more social than other pubs. Even young people from all walks of life seem to thrive and have this place as some kind of get together or gathering place after today's activities.

(Original)
Överlägset den mest välsorterade puben. Har imponerande 53 sorter på tap. Bikers place. Stället har en anrik historia och och har varit The place för bikers. På väggarna sitter enmassa bilder och tavlor från mängder av kändisar inom mc sport och som också varit stammisar på denna pub. Alltifrån Paris-Dakar till kända roadracing förare.
Är ett måste som turist och är en självklarhet för local bikers.
Stället har mobiltelefonsförbud i baren vilket gör att stället är mer socialt än andra pubar. Även ungdomar från allsköns håll ser ut att trivas och har detta ställe som någon sorts get together eller samlingsplats efter dagens aktiviteter.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>(Translated by Google) Great bar. You can eat a burger and enjoy a tasty beer, the choice of which is great here. A machine with a choice of music will allow you to set the atmosphere you want. There is also a closed area where you can sit with a glass of beer and a cigarette

(Original)
Великолепный бар. Пожно перекусить бургером и выпить вкусного пива, выбор которого сдесь велик. Автомат с выбором музыки позволит задать атмосферу какую пожелаешь. Так же тут закрытая площадка на которой можно посидеть с бокалом пива и сигаретой<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Typical SF bar. The terrace is really nice even if the music is a bit strong. They do not take the CB but there is a distributor in the bar (the withdrawal fees are exorbitant against ~ € 3) so the best is to anticipate and have cash!

(Translated by Google) I give it two stars because the burgers were not bad but the rest unpleasant too much I understand the vibe of the place but they are rude too picky for a place like that they got in a bad mood because I took a photo they think it is the louvre even with my girlfriend They were just as rude horrible experience.
