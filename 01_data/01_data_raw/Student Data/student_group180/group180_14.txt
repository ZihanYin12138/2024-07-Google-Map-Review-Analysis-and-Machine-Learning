Very pleased with my cut and beard trim. The guy who did the service made sure it was perfect. He started to cut my hair and after that, he kept looking at my beard and kept making adjustments just to make it perfect. His attention to detail was highly appreciated. He does not make you feel pressured in any way. I am very much happy with the service!< /text>

<Review>It was a job well done at a very affordable cost. The barber that cut my hair was truly masterful because he just finished his job in a few minutes and it was perfectly done. I am thankful for this barbershop!</Review>< Resp>

<text>Great job! This barbershop had both quality and experience I had received for a haircut. Jonah is one of a kind barber and very easygoing. He was into details and took extra care for the cut that I wanted. All the barbers here are passionate and dedicated to their job. I will definitely come back and have my beard trim next week.</text>< Pics>

The hairstylist was apologizing profusely as she cut my hair because she knew she messed up. She cut my hair up so high that it looked like a mohawk. As a working professional, I got so many stares and comments the next day in the office that I had to go somewhere else for ANOTHER haircut in order to buzz it all off. Truly a disaster. Again, the hairstylist apologized throughout the haircut (she messed up early) but I was still expected to pay full price. Never again.< /Text>

I highly recommend this barbershop to all of my family and friends! Just a week ago, I came here to change my hairstyle with the help of your barber. I was so happy when your barber did his best in cutting my hair into an attractive one. I can say that you trained your barber to become more efficient and professional in the field. Until next time! Thanks!</text>

<text>Angelo's in Little Tokyo has a cool setup where they cut your hair on the sidewalk right outside the store due to the coronavirus, which I actually liked better than the usual indoor setup. Better to go after 12:30 or so during the summer cuz otherwise the sun shines right on you apparently. I went at 3pm and it was fine. And Luisa was great and really friendly, but I'm sure the other barbers are fine. They accept only cash or Venmo. Standard mens cut is $35.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Was stressed severely by staff to make an appointment. Did so. Scheduled for 9:30 AM so as to arrive at work on time, arrived at 9:20. They’re supposed to be open at 9, but door was locked and lights were off. Called associate of barber, and was told that barber was running late. Half an hour passed, then was told that another barber would be arriving within 15 minutes. Very sad that team of barbers lack punctuality.</Text>

I'm not happy with my haircut. I told the lady what I wanted, I asked for a low fade to shave with a 1 to 2 on the side  squared off and pointed to where I wanted her to start. She went off on her instinct and cut my hair her way. The sides to high and rounded sides. She offered to give me the cut for free, but it's not about a free cut. Its about listening to the customer.</Review>

I came to this place for a cut, and I left with like 10!

I told the barber I was having a photoshoot later that day. When the barber showed me my haircut, she handed me the mirror instead of holding it up for me to see, no big deal I thought. When I got to my photoshoot later, my crew and models were quick to point out that the back of my neck was all cut up and that it was bad! I had never experienced cuts like these. check the pics.

Also look at the fading job near the ear, not even a good cut!

I tried to go back for a refund, they wouldn't give it to me.<//Review>

Albert is awesome, but if you walk in don’t just let anyone give you a cut. Got a legit horrible haircut, plus the stylist sliced my face up with an unguarded trimmer while lining up my beard. Not going back without an appointment, lesson learned<//review>

<review>Great haircut, in a real barber shop. Over $20 for a cut, so pricey, but they are in a great location in the middle of the city and must pay the rent I suppose. I have a very tricky regular cut, it tends to spike up unless done just right, and Angel, who took care of me, got it just right.

They also validate parking in the lot behind them, which I wish I'd known before I dropped $5 on a street meter parking nearby. Validation makes it an easy choice.

Honestly, I came in here in a rush because I needed a cut for a meeting at work, and it was Monday. Most barber shops are closed Monday. These guys are open 7 days a week!

I'll be back. Sorry no haircut pics. You'll just have to trust me!</review><Time>1486745890820</Time>< GmapID>

Went here for first time after leaving a close by shop that was not clean, Angelo's was very modern, very clean, and priced right for the location. Big screens, new chairs, and friendly service thanks to Johnny who does a bang up job cutting my hair. Thanks!</review>

<text>The shave I got there was horrible. I assume he is better, but stay away from the woman that works there. Not even with the cheapest razors did I cut myself that often like she did today.</text>< user>

Excellent haircut, way to expensive, never paid 50 for a fade, the price drop their star rating to 3. If price changed, they deserve a 5 rate.  Being honest, didn't know they validate, just like not knowing how much they charge for a fade .</review>

(Translated by Google) It cuts very carefully!

While I was going to the States several times, I thought that I would like to have a haircut once in the United States I just got a free time and I have a haircut.

How to make a hairstyle If you think to show the image with a smartphone, how can the smartphone freeze and start up. .

Telling in poor English does not pass well.
I'm going to cut it behind you
I mean shaving
Skin head? In reply
With Magomago

A clerk took out an image with a smartphone
Select Barbar style I liked.

Prices are $ 35 for each cut shampoo.
It seems cheaper if only clippers.

It was my first time to cut like a shaving razor. Arrange cut was kept for only a while to arrange. 
It's amazing technology!

I regret that I should have bought it because the hairdresser selling in the shop is stylish and reasonable.

(Original)
すごく丁寧にカットしてくれます！

何度かアメリカにいくうちに、一度　アメリカで散髪してみたいと思い　ちょうど空き時間が出来て散髪しました。

どんな髪型にするかスマホでイメージをみせようと思ったら、なんとスマホがフリーズして起動せず。。

つたない英語で伝えるも　うまく伝わらず。
うしろは刈り上げて　ってつもりで
シェイブっていったら
スキンヘッド？って返事で
マゴマゴしていると

店員さんがスマホでイメージを出してくれて
気に入ったバーバースタイルをセレクト。

料金はカット　シャンプー　それぞれ別料金で３５ドル。
バリカンのみならもっと安いみたいです。

カミソリでそぐようにカットする切り方は初めてでした。しばらくは整えるだけアレンジカットがキープされていました。
すごい技術です！

店内で販売している整髪料がオシャレでリーズナブルなので買えばよかったと後悔しております。</text>

<gmapID>0x80c2c648576693a7:0xe6fe2149cc58238f< /gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics><review>(Translated by Google) A very excellent barber shop and the barbers are very friendly and really love their work with high professionalism and speed in providing the service, but the prices are high but they offer a five-star service for the session they provide what you want for 30 dollars per session not for the service for example if you asked for creative chin and hair then this costs you $ 30 and also if you ask for a shave Chin only or hair only, preferably book at least one day before your arrival. As for the customer without an appointment, he can stay according to the circumstances of appointments and working hours are from 9 am to 4 pm

محل حلاقة ممتاز جدا والحلاقون ودودون جدا ويحبون فعلا عملهم وباحترافية عالية وسرعة في تقديم الخدمة الا ان الاسعار مرتفعة ولكن يقدمون مقابلها خدمة خمسة نجوم الجلسة يقومون بتقديم ماتريد مقابل 30 دولار للجلسة ةليس للخدمة مثلا اذا طلبت خلاقة الذقن والشعر فهذا يكلفك 30 دولار وكذلك اذا طلبت حلاقة الذقن فقط او الشعر فقط ويفضل ان تحجز قبل قدومك بيوم على الاقل اما الزبون من دون موعد فيستطيع ان يبقى حسب ظروف المواعيد ومواعيد العمل هي من 9 ص الى 4 عصرا</review><username>Abdulaziz AbuAbdullah</username>< Response>

<review>We stayed on Easter weekend and were pleasantly surprised.  Location is great as it’s only a 5 minute drive to town and has easy access to Jedediah Smith Redwoods.

Park was quiet as we were in a section that was mostly empty since it was the off season.  Didn’t use the amenities as we were fully self contained but did take a look and they seem decent.  IMO one of the better places to stay in Crescent City.<//review>< pics>

Road trip from WA to S Cali, entering Cali couldn't find a campsite with space available.  Came across this one at about 9:00pm found a good spot, put my overnight payment on the envelope and sleped great. Only vehicle in the tents only side<//review>

<review>The park manager cut the cord on the dryier so we could not use it. He informed me that everyone can go to the laundry mat. I asked the slum lord. What about the people in this park that has no. Means to travel to the laundry mat and he said that it is not his problem. If you don't like it leave.</review>< user_name>

It's a beautiful & quiet spot. It's located on the outskirts of town but you'd never know. Not once did I hear any traffic from the road or freeway, which is very close.
On the downside It's expensive, Wi-Fi is nonexistent and cable doesn't work but tbh we didn't need all that because we enjoy the outdoors. The beaches are close and there's tons of beautiful hiking in the area.<//Text>

<text>Quiet RV park mostly filled with long termers and permanents, and most of them here for the fishing. Otherwise, clean park, surrounded by trees. There are bears that wander into the park at night. Verizon 4G coverage is poor here. Water pressure is great. Very little rules here, yet residents do a good job of respecting others and keeping their space clean. Lots of people parking their boats in here. There's tent camping and overnight spaces up front, long term RVers in the back. Spaces are very close together, you could almost ask your neighbor to pass the potatoes. Would definitely stay here the next time we are back in town.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsOLX4FHogRKmrL1lYfVkIsT1xINBFRBcDSXF0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjT9vFwc7khGB_a_RHZpQDEXaWqXQpwk_0BVVm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1mhUAXaFfGdRVIpdMT3-DaLt9Lt6uVpnsTd48=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9b-fLgZ_EZWKhSJYqhfOkYnMFbWb5cX2MtmmQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTCXCCbSVnLr-rYug7AT5sxbuNIj2UuHGYU3LV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

<Review>Unfortunately the park doesn't enforce their own rules, kids were running wild with no supervision. The cable is grainy or fairly clear and channel reception was variable and limited due the trees at any given time, 4G reception was spotty but mostly okay. Good location, noisy at times, good for a weekend or so, friendly staff but not enforcement friendly. Would recommend for shorter stays, however, reasonable term rates. It's a toss up, good and not so good. Could be better but good, somewhat.</Review>< pictures>

Went to Crescent City to visit a Friend.  First few RV camps I tried were full, Village Camper Inn was able to take me for a couple of days.  Kinda glad.  The places on the ocean would have been way too cold and windy. This was tucked up against a hill with plenty of trees.  The friendly staff was able to tell me how to navigate the park to position myself the best to back in.  Remarkable since they have a plethora of sites.  Cell reception was poor but worked.  Wi Fi was worthless.  Fire rings were truck tire rims.  Did not take advantage of any of the other amenities.</text>

Maid's are apparently absent, as to the fact there is visible dust and grime on all surfaces. Internet signal was unusable. A warm place to stay, hot shower and a bit of TV, is better than sleeping in the car on a cold rainy night.</text>

Was passing through when the clutch went on our truck. Needed a place to park our 5th wheel and try to get the truck repaired. These people were awsome. The staff is wonderful. The park is clean. Easily one of the nicer parks we've stayed in. And its a short bike ride to the entire town. Small town hospitality at its best.< /Review>

<Text>Great place to camp.  Site are large and you have the trees all around you.
Horse shoe pits, basket ball, pickle ball.

The only downfall is there is no small store of anything you forgot.  But close to stores and Walmart.< /Text>< userid>

Stayed here for five nights. Lovely, well managed grounds. Friendly atmosphere. A pleasure to walk in the park with our dog. Crescent City has much to offer. State and other parks in the area are awesome. We only planned to stay a short time, and then extended our trip. Loved it. Would give five stars, but, honestly, while the staff was efficient, they were a bit brusque, consistently. Worse, the person helping settle people into spots was not helpful. These are minor complaints! Otherwise, it was great. Don't hesitate to stay here.</review>

Super clean... Groomed park quiet and the staff it's was and welcoming as well  priced in a comfortable range or just 270 a week. Includes pspace, water, sewer, hot clean showers and laundry. Seconds off the freeway and to Walmart but the feel of the wilderness. Only 10 minutes to the beach by car, but close enough to bike as well. Lots of space for the family. Pet friendly. I can't say enough. Make this your choice and you can't go wrong<//Text>

The woman who cleans the bathrooms MUST be family, as no one as rude and hateful as that woman is, could ever hold a job otherwise.
I thought Laundry was ridiculously expensive, $9 for 2 loads!
Only one bathroom, and Not ADA compliant, at all. I'm surprised no one has sued them yet.
It IS a nice, park though, one of the nicest wooded parks in the area.

<review>Nice woodsy place, very nice staff, full hookups, showers are wonderful! However..... there is a lot of permanent residents whose dogs bark 24/7, also theres this god awful marina horn that goes off ever 5 seconds 24 hrs a day. And is super close to the road so u hear traffic all the time. But most annoying of all is the resident dogs barking constantly. Wont be back due to this.<//review><response>None</response><Time>1540409217250< /Time><Rate>3< /Rate>< user_id>

<Review>Depends upon where you stay in the park, but lower portion is a cul de sac with bbq or fire pits with old rings (looked like tire rims) that don't cover the pit at all, grass on only some of the sites, 1 set of showers for entire park and were kind of nasty in my opinion/not super clean, daughter said temp on showers went from Hot to Cold, so remainder of trip scattered our showers in our RV, no maintenance on the pads (swept my own, and was happy), don't allow tent camping with RV spot (same price almost as RV spot, yikes! - might pay $10 for a campsite) so difficult on having a larger family (which guessing they want to discourage anyway), trash on arrival date was overflowing, not much business, so guessing the high $48/night is keeping people away, nice shade, cool surroundings, great 10 minute access to beach and if needed, 2 min from Walmart.< /Review>< rating>

This RV park is not very well taken care & run down. Check in lady was not friendly at all. Good Sam should really consider removing their name from this RV park.</review>

Stayed here for a long time while employed temporarily in the area.  VERY pleased with the campground, the employees of the campground (Friendly and Helpful) people in the park were great! and I really hated to leave when it was time to go.  I would advise anyone to come by for a night, a month or a year.  I can not imagine you not liking this place.  You can't find a better place in this area.  The prices are right also.  Come see and stay.< /text>

Nice and quiet. Clean facilities but when checking in on a Sunday there's no info in the paperwork for washroom codes,Internet which was almost non existent and a list of cable channels. Other than that which would be an easy fix, it was clean and quiet.<//text>

Came in after a long day at work,  a customer was being very rude to the cashier, who was angie. She remained patient and respectful towards them and after that customer instead of being irritated she greeted me and conversed with me making my day so much better! Always a pleasure walking in and seeing someone not letting a rude customer ruin their day. She was very kind. great personality for the environment!</text>

Yesterday was our first time we came to that restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the excellent service, with the finest  cuisine and booze and with the friendly price. We will surely return there again.<//Review>

Horrible experience with manager.  Staff member gave me mushrooms instead of chicken and I am allergic to mushrooms.  The manager was rude and will not give me a refund. I do not live in the area so luckily will never have to go back.  STAY AWAY.<//Review>

Got there at 10:15 am, they are supposed to be open at 10:00 am and ready to serve, nothing is ready; management should start their cooks earlier, otherwise friendly staff.<//review>

Crab puffs and egg rolls over cooked but food solid and they do remember your order. Don't care for the chow mein, but reasonable price and service is good</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

Great selection of asian foods; great selection of produce; nice meat market; lots of parking; and good sanitation practices...you have to wear gloves and sanitize your hands before entering (both provided), wear a facemask, and keep social distancing</Text>

(Translated by Google) The place is dirty and super but super bad services, bad service I do not recommend it at all and expensive, without order the place and rude those who attend, all the workers are in arrogant behavior ... The quality of the basic product and the meats. 😶

I had a tooth emergency to arise and it escalated to requiring immediate attention.  I called Yosemite Dental Care at 7:15 A.M. PST and was greeted by a truly caring associate who expressed concern as well and she immediately scheduled me for an appointment at 12:30 P.M. PST the same day - ‘see you in 5 hours!’  From the moment I arrived I was treated with the utmost respect and professional care.  Dr. Allyson offered me the best care and attention I have ever experienced in a dental office, which is the standard for this facility.  Thanks to everyone there my issue was resolved.  Kudos to all!</review>

< Review>
I  went for a routine visit.  The staff is highly efficient.  My hygienist is Gina..  She has a beautiful demeanor and a soft touch. In addition to her superb job, she gives me tips on how to maintain my oral hygiene better.  I highly recommend Yosemite Dental for their caring treatment to each patient.</Review>

<text>Appointment was on time. I was a little bit caught off guard as they have changed procedures and iam not sure why.  Normally the hygienist cleans my teeth and then does the final polishing when she finishes the initial cleaning. This time they had another girl come in and take x-rays, my back molars only, not sure why and then did the final polishing first. This seems odd to me. There was no explanation as to why the new procedure. One of my complaints is that the girl doing the polishing and flossing did not floss UNDER MY BRIDGE and I did not feel like she knew how to floss my teeth properly. She just quickly slid the floss down the center space of each tooth instead of sliding it down the side of each tooth and under the gum line. This bothered me a lot. The other thing was that there was no record of my having a bridge! The hygienist said she fixed that in my file, she said that my file merely indicated I was missing those teeth. I've had this bridge for approximately 40+ years . Something is wrong here!! I HAVE TEETH UNDER THIS BRIDGE!! and have had REPEATED ROOT CANALS ON THESE TEETH UNDER MY BRIDGE!! They also did not do full mouth x-rays. They only did my back molars. WHY? I've had repeated root canals done on that bridge area. As I lost the teeth due to a horse back riding accident when my horse and I collided with a pick up truck and I went head first into the windshield. Iam disappointed this is not in my file anywhere after all these years.

And the dentists and staff are wonderful, always interested in whatever the problem is and answer any questions you have. Another perk is they offer a dental care financial plan to help if you don't have dental insurance. I highly recommend this dental office to anyone.< /Review><Time>1615951774955</Time>< rating>

It is always a pleasure to visit this office, the staff are kind, knowledgeable, and professional. The office itself is spotless, well appointed, comfortable and the artwork is fantastic. I was not surprised to see the efforts made to create a safe space regarding COVID 19 guidelines for their staff and patients. And while there, I experienced the joy of a fellow patient, who seemed to not be the least bit concerned for his procedures and was very excited to visit the toy chest! Just another testament to the professionalism of this staff. Thank you Dr. Weig, your team are the best!< /review>

I also had a cleaning and was pleased with the thoroughness of the cleaning and the explanation of the condition of my teeth. The office is warm and clean. Very comfortable.....

more os an assembly line then a dentist office, got in seated 10 min , dr/ dentist came in for 2 min , check out teeth, asked about concerns and went to next patient, after sitting there another 10-15 min hygienist finally came in and cleaned teeth. I get there buys but why have people sitting there for 20-25 min while you work on other people, Patients time is just as important as yours and why not work with patients schedules then just pack them in?</review>

Yosemite Dental care has been great for making sure our teeth are healthy and helping to keep bright smiles. We started going to Dr. Tom's caring clinic years ago. Jena keeps us informed with tips for cleaning our teeth more efficiently. Dr. Karen  was so helpful to guide us after some health issues and I was very please with a cap Dr. Tim replaced. During Covid this year they all helped us feel safe and comfortable our last visit.<//text>

I highly recommend Yosemite Dental Care in Mariposa! Seriously - I’ve moved to Yosemite Valley this past year and prior to this have had the same dentist since I was 14 (I’m almost 31 now) and knew it’d be hard to find a dentist that could live up to my expectations of efficiency and patient care. The folks at Yosemite Dental Care far surpassed my expectations! I feel at home here. Every member of the staff, from the moment I called to inquire about an appointment to the the moment I realized I left my lights on and killed my battery in their parking lot, treated me like a member of their family. (Huge shout out to the receptionist who I asked for jumper cables in the parking lot and Dr. Tim for taking time out of his busy day to jump our car! Seriously guys - this is the hospitality and humanity we all crave in this world!) But wait! - it gets better! I went in three days before my Dental ended, (I know I’m a mess) knowing that I’d need a deep cleaning and these people cared enough to go WAY ABOVE AND BEYOND to MAKE TIME for me. Jena was an amazing, wonderful, personable, hygienist who was gracious enough to fit me in on this busy day to ensure I was able to get the service I needed. She made me feel so at home and provided me with best most conscientious care to ensure I wasn’t in pain during the first portion of my deep cleaning. The staff worked hard to manage to fit me in the following day, super last minute, for the second portion of my deep cleaning, (which was seriously needed might I add) even though they were pretty booked. Sarah, the hygienist who took care of me on the following day was equally as wonderful and even told me about their family plan for folks without insurance to provide me with options after my dental expired. It’s safe to say that you want Yosemite Dental Care to be a part of your dental experience. The staff was also super conscientious of cleanliness and safety during this scary pandemic! If I could give more stars I would! Big thanks to all the staff at Yosemite Dental Care in Mariposa - I’ve never felt more cared for, safe, and welcome at a dentist’s office!<//text>

I want to thank Dr. Tom Wieg and his Staff for giving me my life back. I actually had a Cardiac Arrest for 18 minutes and was in a coma for 4 days after my teeth were pulled when Western Dental in Merced, Ca. Dr. Guindi in Fresno, Ca. and Wisdom Teeth Away in Fresno, Ca. all told me I had some infection in my mouth and then removed all my teeth. I didn't find out until after my Cardiac Arrest for 18 minutes that there wasn't any infection. Thanks to Dr. Wieg and his staff at Yosemite Dental Care here in Mariposa, CA. I not only have my life back but I can now smile again!!! I just want everyone to know that Dr. Wieg really cares about his patients and I am proof of this!!! I would recommend Dr. Wieg to the World a million times over!!! Thank you Dr. Wieg for giving me my life back and for making me smile again, it's been a long time coming and I am truly thankful and Grateful to you and to your staff for treating me like a human being and not like a money maker!! God Bless you and your Staff!!! Love Always, Bobbie Joe Cavazos< /review>

< Review>
Took my 2 year old here for her first dentist appointment, the staff were incredibly patient and kind. From the moment we entered to checking out, everyone was friendly and accommodating to my toddler. The staff had concerns about her teeth but would not do the cavity screening for fear of scaring her. This resulted in me having to take her to a pediatric dentist, I wish they had just done the screening because it simply involved poking her teeth with the instrument. This visit was good overall.

Returned for a cleaning for myself, and had a completely different experience. The dentist was wonderful, I enjoyed my visit with her and she was thorough. The hygienist on the other hand was a terrible experience. She was very rough, scraping underneath my gums, causing a lot of bleeding, and ignoring my obvious pain. I was unable to floss for several days without pain after this appointment. I did not have any tooth concerns, cavities, and am diligent with my dental hygiene, this cleaning was unnecessarily painful, I had never had an experience like it. I wish I had the wherewithal to stop the cleaning and express my confusion, but I didn't. I had hoped the amount of blood and constant wincing was plenty, but I should have said something. I recommend the dentist, but encourage others to have caution with your hygienist and speak up if it is painful.< /Review>

<Text>Jan. '21: I go back to when "Yosemite Dental" was  Dr. Thomas Wieg up on the hill.  This practice is very professional and observant of today's safety protocols.  My experience today with Dr. Allyson Milman was great.  She is the first dentist other than Dr. Wieg who's worked on my teeth in many, many years.  Explains every step of the process and executes with precision.

Apr. '21: Went back today for cleaning with Jaime. Excellent!< /Text>< pics>

Both my Husband and I, Robert and Jennifer, love Dr. Allyson’s amazing work.  She truly executes mastery in her work, and she has never disappointed us.  She’s very kind, focused and extremely precise with a very steady hand.  The music she hums with her beautiful voice is always very calming.  We’ve also had the pleasure of having our teeth cleaned by Jena.  She’s also so kind, skilled, gentle and very precise every time in her work. The Reception support staff is also courteous, professional, and kind.  In fact, Yosemite Dental has exemplified exceptional quality in their work for our family of 3 generations here in Mariposa!  The price and discount plans are very reasonable.  Yosemite Dental’s skilled staff of Excellence will not let you down - -ever.  It is our sincere pleasure to highly recommend them to you for you and your family’s next dentist visit.< /Text>

<text>These folks take excellent care of my wife and I. State of the art in a small rural town. Still just as great here in August 2020.

Had a crown done in less than 2 hours on 6/19/21. The time included 45 minutes where I could go do a few errands. Never felt any pain during, after or any time in the next 24 hours.< /text>< user_id>

Impeccable COVID protocol, extra effort in appt scheduling due to our distance from the office, and superior workmanship!

Dr. Allyson replaced a recent filling that failed (my fault), at no charge!

========================

I posted the above awhile back, and a subsequent visit reinforces my rating. Becoming a big fan of Dr. Allyson!<//Text>

<text>Being new in town, and losing a crown, plus the stay-at-home order for COVID-19 made finding a dentist a bit daunting!  I called Yosemite Dental Care and got an emergency appointment. Dr. Tim was able to reseat my crown in the nick of time. Nice office and great caring staff. I look forward to being a real patient here soon!!<//text><rating>5<//rating>< pics>

<Review>The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. There was no pressure, and I was nervous, thinking I was too old to make a difference in my oral health. Dr. A Milman was professional, and the Dental Assistant made my experience unforgettable. It's a 4-hour drive, but I am a customer for life now!<//Review><Response>None< /Response></record>

I was referred to these guys from a friend who works in Yosemite and I couldn't have been happier that she did. The staff here is super friendly and will work with you to meet any of your dental needs. I had an awesome conversation with the dentists there who were cleaning my teeth, which by the way, they did an amazingly thorough job at!

With all of this going for them, here's the kicker: all of your dental cleanings are free! That's right, you heard it, free.... even without insurance!

It is amazing to have a dental office in the United States that provides free cleanings without insurance, especially with how expensive health care in general is. These people are doing it right and I wish more offices around the states would follow suit.

I will definitely be coming back to this office,< /text>

< review>
I have heard wonderful things about Dr. Weig over the years that I have lived in Mariposa, although was continuing to see my former dentist near my previous home.  Finally, I took the plunge and went to see him with an emergency problem.  I immediately was able to see why everyone raves about him.  He is straight forward, calm and patient.  His technique was great too. In short I am pleased to be a new customer of Dr. Weig and appreciate his office staff who are equally professional.  Thank you</review>

They are knowledgeable and supportive of our health goals. Every time we come to his practice we feel welcomed and leave encouraged and motivated. I started taking my daughter for gut issues and noticed amazing results after only 3 visits. We started taking all of our children to his office and feel grateful to have found him. I cant wait to start seeing him myself. Keep doing what you do Dr. Donahoe! Our community is so blessed to have you!<//review><gmapID>0x80dc824a378761a7:0xa307bdbf9595210< /gmapID>< time>

I love how she gets to know my teens and how comfortable they are with her Dr Oldenburg. Also my little guy who is 8 loves seeing her and she is always so patient with all his quirks and constant talking. I appreciate everything she does for my guys.</review>

I love the time Dr. Donohoe takes with me and my kids. He spent time making sure that my daughter’s gait was correct and listening to her patiently as she described her problem areas. It is a pleasure to be a patient here. The front office staff is super friendly and helpful.<//review>

<text>I'm so happy to have been referred here by a friend. They have amazing service and make you feel welcomed from the moment you walk in. They were very thorough in explaining everything. My son had been having the worst headaches and after seeing a Neurologist we opt to trying this office. His headaches have gone from 8/10 everyday to now vary rarely and at most 2/10. The doctor explains step by step what they are doing and makes you feel very included in the process. Would definitely recommend this office!!!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

I’ve been a long time patient at Donohoe Chiropractic.  I am super impressed with the science of the technique and have had tremendous results over the years.  I continue to visit for some issues, but mostly just regular maintenance.  Props to Dr. Wilder, she does fantastic work.< /text>

My daughter and I had the best experience! The how and the why of each procedure was thoroughly explained by Dr. Donohoe. He was so great about answering my questions and insuring I was well informed. Excellent bedside manner! Looking forward to our next visit!<//text>

My son tends to slouch, and loves to ride dirt bikes, jump off trees, wrestle around and other boy things that tend to give him a sore back and neck.  I am so impressed and happy with how she finds his trouble spots every time. The whole office is amazing, and he walks away feeling better every single time. Highly highly recommend this office to anyone thinking about getting some chiropractic care!<//review>< resp>

What can I say this place is amazing, there's never a bad moment here. Staff is amazing always showing they care how we are doing and how I feel. Never had a place follow up with patients before so 5 stars for that. I have a bad back and every time I go in I know I'm in good hands. Very clean place nothing but the best in this office. I love the fact that they treat you like family here.
Thank you all for being there for me in my time of need. I hope my sessions continue till I better.< /Review>

I know this office doesn’t need my review, because they have nothing but 5 star, positive reviews, but I left there feeling like I owe them one. Although their books are full you would never guess. The office and doctor were very kind, attentive, and efficient. They handled my baby like I would imagine their own. Donohoe made sure I understood what he was doing, and worked throughout the appointment like he had no where else to be. Very professional and respectful.<//Text>

<review>From help with an Injured back to pregnancy and supplements. This office helped me during some really difficult times. Dr.Oldenburg is caring and informative. Super patient and had great communication. Her care was essential through my pregnancy and post. Scheduling is easy and the front desk has been helpful on so many occasions when something has come up.

Chiropractic care, supplements for my children and now visiting for massage with Sandy. Sandy is absolutely amazing! I hurt so bad on a daily basis that the relief from an 80 minute massage is incredibly welcomed.  She has beautiful communication and explains exactly what's going on. There has only ever been one instance of miscommunication and poor attitude from a young lady that I don't believe is there anymore. However, that small moment doesn't take away from the quality care I've received through the months at Donohoe Chiropractics.<//review>< gmapID>

When I saw the complimentary kombucha on tap, I knew this was the place for me. Dr. O listened to my concerns and walked me through everything she thought necessary. A night & day difference from another chiropractic office in this valley (who only subscribed me to lock into one of their multi x’s a week plans without even checking anything on me). My only regret is not coming to Donohoe sooner! After one adjustment, I could immediately feel my body making improvements.</Review>< pics>

I heard  about Donohoe Chiropractic from my daughter (who is a patient).  I've been having pain in my neck, left shoulder, and right hip (arthritis).  I wanted to give this a try before requesting PT.  I absolutely love Dr. Oldenburg!  I feel that the treatment is helping in areas that the PT can't and both my  PT and chiro are supportive of what the other does.  The office is clean and the staff is very friendly.  I'd recommend Donohoe Chiropractic to everyone.< /review>

< Review>
Dr. Donohoe is seriously the best! I started coming in at 3 months pregnant and it was the best decision. I was experiencing pain from still nursing my little one....his practice makes it a comfortable experience and its not a manipulative adjustment that's harsh on the body. His years of experience shows, that we even now bring in our daughter, she was having issues passing gas and with sleep. It was like a night and day turn around for her....no more restless nights like we were experiencing which was about 5 days a week! Her pediatrician couldn't even help her and thought nothing was wrong. My family highly recommended this office.<//Review>

Dr. Donohoe is amazing. It so refreshing to find someone with so much knowledge and a very holistic approach. He took his time explaining everything and making sure I felt comfortable during the exam. At 9 months pregnant its something I really appreciated. He answered all of my questions and I left feeling like a million bucks.<//text>

Dr Donohoe helped me through two difficult pregnancy related back problems (SI pain and pelvic instability). Our whole family continues to use the services of the other doctors today. We’ve been a patients since 2013. Highly recommend their office to anyone who is looking for superior chiropractic care. Love that they use the activator method which is more gentle than manual adjustments which always intimidated me in years past. Also, their tables recline from the standing position making it much easier to get on and off the table. No more tweaking your back when rolling over either. All the staff is professional and friendly. We love their holistic approach to health! They are a real blessing to our entire family.< /Text>

<Review>My 6 week old was beyond fussy, wouldn’t latch & had a painful cry all day every day. After going down the list of things that were bothering him (tongue ties & colic) his tongue tie doctor referred us to a chiropractor to see if anything was misaligned. After the adjustment doctor did on my son he has been out of any discomfort. Their way of realignment is very new age and pain free which was my concern for my baby. Highly recommended for babies and can’t wait to get adjusted myself!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1603157679367, 'text': 'Wonderful news!

I was referred to Dr. Donohoe by a friend when I was pregnant and having severe back pain. After 3 sessions, I felt so much relief so I continued to see him for the remainder of my pregnancy. When my daughter was born 5 weeks early, he also saw her to make sure her alignment was good after a rough delivery. My daughter continues to see him, and I see Dr. Wilder. We also went to a lactation consultant there, and of course we love the Elderberry Syrup. I drive almost 30 minutes, but I would not feel comfortable going anywhere else.</text>

I started coming here in January, two weeks before I was due with my son, due to very bad sciatic pain along with other pregnancy related pain. I was not able to walk normal getting on the table and after getting off the table I was walking normal. Just amazing! I call their technique witch craft/magic as a joke but it is crazy how perfect it works and how they can pin pony and isolate the problem. We use to go to beer creek where we would walk in and get cracked all the same and sometimes felt worse after. I convinced my husband to try it out even though he was skeptical about a non-manual cracking technique. He was SHOCKED and laughed in disbelief the first time. Now we go every two weeks. Our daughter loves coming here since they are extremely child friendly and she gets a sticker every time on the way out. She also loves playing with all the great toys while mom and dad get fixed up. My husband needs several surgeries including multi level spinal fusion, and a shoulder procured to reconnect his collar bone with a permanent strap. He has been prescribed every pain medicine and hates taking them but sometimes has no choice because of the pain, especially after work. Since coming here he has been able to take  less pills which is our ultimate goal. Thank you from the bottom of a worried wife’s heart ❤️<//Text>

<Text>The office is always very clean, front office staff is friendly but sometimes I do feel a little rushed, but then it is a busy office.  Dr. Wilder has always been so helpful and always listens to our concerns and really seems to care about ours and our childrens health and well-being.  We have been seeing Dr. Wilder for approximately 2 years.  Our children have seen all three doctors and all have been wonderful!</Text>< pictures>

I was seeing Dr Oldenburg during my pregnancy and had such a great experience that I knew I wanted to bring my baby to see Dr Donohoe as soon as possible. I love how well they explain everything and how comfortable they make you feel. Everyone is so nice and I always feel so good leaving there that I knew my baby was on good hands too. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for chiropractic care.< /review>

Wow! This place was amazing. My daughter felt super comfortable with Dr.Donohoe & the friendly environment he provided! I was able to get a quick appointment. My daughter was up at 2am crying about a ear ache . She got adjusted and she has been fine, no more aching. There was no waiting time at all. Inside the room was a little kitchen and books my daughter was able to play with and get comfortable before her adjustment and keep her busy while I talked with the Dr.
Dr.Donohoe has such a beautiful sweet soul and my daughter was able to feel it. She didn't cry as she usually does at any Dr. visits. He walked us through the whole process. We drove from Riverside && let me tell you he is 100% worth it! We will be back!< /Review>

<review>Simply the best pediatric care I have ever recieved for my children. Dr. Donohoe is so knowledgeable and was able to even help my infant son with his lip/tongue tie issues as well as his colic-like tummy troubles. And the staff is great so friendly and accommodating. They always schedule all 3 of my boys back to back and we are seen promptly, hardly in the waiting room but a few minutes. My family is so blessed to be getting such great care.<//review>< Pics>

Dr. Oldenburg is so professional and kind! She took the time to understand my medical history and conducted a full chiropractic exam before doing any adjustments. Melissa and Julie were also very helpful and sweet when I called and when I visited their office. Overall they are a lovely group and I look forward to my future visits with them!</text>

<Text>My family and I have been coming to see Dr. Donohoe for almost 5 years now. I absolutely love this practice. Such care and compassion at every visit. The front office staff is so wonderful. There are a variety of supplements and vitamins you can purchase right there in the office. The elderberry is a must purchase every cold and flu season! We had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Oldenburg yesterday with our 5 year old and he absolutely loved her. He didn’t want to leave! All of the doctors at the practice aren’t your crack, snap and pop chiropractors. Every adjustment is done with precision and not cracking and popping you back into place. We love Donohoe Chiropractic.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I can’t recommend this office more! The Drs are awesome and very thorough! Office is clean, organized and peaceful. I always leave feeling so much better than when I got there. They’ve helped me with back, neck and shoulder pain. They also helped with tendinitis in my elbow. Their masseuse Sandy is phenomenal! She helped with tension in my neck, arm and back just after 1 massage! They also have a great selection of supplements and creams. I bought a water pillow from them and I love it! It’s helped with relieving neck pain while sleeping.< /review>

<Review>I’ve been coming to Donohoe Chiropractic for 5 months now and have been receiving treatment from Dr. Wilder for a back injury. After a few sessions my back started getting to a place where I could live my life again, the treatment here is wonderful and gentle. Everyone in the front office is so nice and inviting, they get you checked in and set up very quickly. Wait times are incredibly quick and the doctors are prompt and listen to what you need. The office is comfortable and aesthetically appealing and the treatment rooms are very clean. I’m so glad I took a recommendation and made an appointment here.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Dr donohoe was super gentle with our 10 week old. He answered all our questions and educated us on so much. So thankful we found him and hoping that the adjustments help our baby with her constipation and reflux issues. I will recommend this place to all friends and family.

Update: our baby has gone from pooping once a week to once a day, occasionally she will miss a day. That’s a huge improvement! So happy we took her in!< /review>< gmapID>

Dr. Donohoe is the absolute best! He is so knowledgeable about infant development and health. He has a great rapport with infants and kids! He has been helping me address my infant’s reflux and slightly flat head, and he helped my first baby with tightness in her neck. I have also been treated at their practice during pregnancy and for postpartum back pain. I highly recommend them!</review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I saw Dr. Donohoe with my last pregnancy and currently seeing Dr. Oldenburg. They are both phenomenal doctors! I wish I knew about prenatal chiropractic care care my first. Not having to suffer through the aches and pains that come with pregnancy has been life changing! Both doctors have always taken their time and listened to my concerns and educated me with each visit.  I can't recommend this practice enough! I'm so grateful for this office and the care they provide!< /Review>< pictures>

On September 28th we went to a specialist to have our daughters tongue and lip ties released. She recommended we see a lactation consultant and a chiropractor for after care.

Two weeks ago we went to this chiropractors office. No one was wearing masks but when we asked the assistant to she did happily. The chiropractor then came in and said he had a collapsed diaphragm so he would only put the mask on when he got close to her... ooookay? But we let it go because he’s supposed to be the best. He recommended we come back for a follow up which we then scheduled for today. My wife left a Yelp review saying he was a great chiropractor but if masks were important to you not to see him right now.

We went back in today, again no masks. When the chiropractor came in my wife asked him to wear a mask while handling her (It’s a mandate in California that businesses comply with mask orders). He then asked why we were asking him to wear a mask and my wife said because it’s the mandate and we’re trying to protect our daughter (4 weeks old).
He then proceeded to scream at us that he was not required to wear a mask, masks decrease oxygen and actually contribute to the spread of diseases and that our daughter was the least likely demographic to get COVID and that he knew about my wife’s review on Yelp and was going to look past it and treat our daughter but now he won’t be “disrespected” in his own business and asked us to leave.
So now im shaking and crying. My baby is crying. We obviously left but i just can’t believe something so simple was so hard to do? I know i can’t force people to wear masks but as a business in California there is a mandate (we called and confirmed with the board in California) and we’re just first time parents trying to protect our baby. Is it so wrong to try to protect my daughter?< /text>

{'time': 1603155518562, 'text': "First, let's clarify some facts. Dr. Donohoe went in to treat your daughter on his\xa0day off. He called you immediately after reading your Yelp review to discuss. You chose not to return his call. Dr. Donohoe doesn't have a collapsed\xa0lung - not sure where that came from. He has an SCI therefore, he is protected\xa0under the American for Disabilities\xa0Act as a Disabled American.\xa0Everyone\xa0that knows Dr. Donohoe, knows he doesn't raise his voice - again he is very quiet due to his demeanor and his disability. As far as your views on masks, we completely\xa0respect\xa0your opinion\xa0and will not debate with you.\n\nHow incredibly disappointing to urge others to not go to a business\xa0because\xa0you don't like their policies and be so rude to someone that is disabled demanding that he wear a mask. (This could very well be viewed as discrimination on your part.) Then you expect to waltz back into the same business that you left a negative review for and have access to care, unbelievable. So many businesses have been greatly damaged during\xa0this time, some to the point of never reopening. \xa0Why not make a phone call instead of bashing a business publicly\xa0for doing what is within their rights to do?\n\nWe have come way too far in 23 amazing years in practice serving this very community with excellence to be bullied. We are clearly not the office for you. We hope the very best for your baby."}</Response>

I saw Dr. Oldenburg throughout my pregnancy and felt better after each visit. She is very attentive and provides excellent care. She was able to spot I was having a reaction to a medication that was prescribed by my OB. I am thankful to have found a Dr. That actually listens to your concerns!< /Review>

Dr. Donohoe and Dr. Oldenburg helped me in so many ways, through pregnancy, previous issues with my neck and back, and my daughter (as early as 3 weeks old). The office is so welcoming and all the girls are amazing! I have and will continue to recommend this office to my friends and family.</Text>

A wonderful chiropractic office. I had just had surgery and couldn’t sit for long and Marilyn and Dr. Oldenburg took complete care of me and saw me right away so I would have the least discomfort possible.
This office feels like family and everyone is so kind and sweet and very skillful with what they do. I’ll never go elsewhere!<//Review>

< review>
Dr. Donohoe is very friendly and super informative!! We absolutely love how friendly the staff is and we are most grateful for how they are super supportive of families! They are very accommodating for my active two year old son! I first met Dr. Donohoe during week 32 of my pregnancy. I had been having a lot of pain and we had found out our daughter was breeched! After being adjusted once by Dr. Donohoe and seen again two days later she had flipped! We were so thankful. My pain I had been experiencing went way down and I was able to care for my son again and get around more! He helped prepare my body for an unmedicated, natural delivery I had hoped for. I can joyfully say I had a very smooth and unmedicated delivery of our daughter and I credit a big part of that to the care I received by Dr. Donohoe! Look forward to seeing him again for post partum healing as well as having our baby adjusted!<//review>

Dr. Donohoe has helped myself and my family for over 10 years! I saw him through all 3 of my pregnancies and each baby was seen by him days after being born. He even helped my oldest avoid having to go on meds for reflux as a newborn. He educated us on why it's so vital to a newborn's digestive system to avoid medication like antacids. I know that having regular adjustments throughout my 2nd and 3rd pregnancy helped prepare my body and gave me the confidence to have 2 successful vbacs! We as a family will continue to support and visit this office as long as it's in business! We love Dr. Donohoe and all his staff!</Review>

<review>Donohoe Chiropractic is professional, compassionate, and thorough! Myself, my husband, and our 18mo are all patients of Donohoe Chiropractic. Every aspect of our appointments have been positive- from scheduling and text message appt reminders to the friendly and inviting front office staff and availability of natural health supplements on hand to purchase. I see Dr. Oldenburg to help with an ongoing issue and my 18mo sees Dr. Donohoe who first identified the cause of her reflux at 6mos and was able to help relieve her symptoms! Both doctors have also helped relieve sinus and ear pressure from seasonal allergies and cold symptoms- total game changer! They are kind and knowledgeable, answering all my questions and never making us feel rushed! An added bonus is the free kombucha samples at check out! I highly recommend Donohoe Chiropractic to everyone I know!<//review>< pictures>

We went for the first time yesterday for my 22 month old and I will say Dr Donohoe is hands down the best Chiropractor we have ever seen. He was very nice, explained everything very thorough, took his time  and I didn’t feel like he rushed us through. He really cares about his patients and it’s very clear. He was great with my son. We will be back very soon.< /Review>

The office staff are amazing! The atmosphere is so welcoming and friendly. I love the products available for purchase that go along with the holistic health and living. I am seeing Dr. Oldenburg to help address two problems I’ve run into in my 4th pregnancy. One is SI joint dysfunction, and the other is my baby’s position (frank breech). Dr. Oldenburg has been so informative and so helpful with both of these matters. I am already feeling much better and able to get around easier with only having had two adjustments. I am so grateful for her!< /Text>

We love Donohoe Chiropractic.  They offer much more than just an adjustment.  With the gentle manor they have adjusted myself during pregnancy to my 4 children which included my youngest at 2 days old. They are also great support for a new mom.   You feel like a family member and not a number.  With the new beautiful renovation there lobby is so spacious and welcoming.  They have large rooms to accommodate me and my four children with toys for the kids to keep entertained. The type of adjusting they do you don’t have to return multiple times a week.<//review>

Never before have I come across chiropractors who did anything other than ‘crack’ and ‘pop’ me. Little did I know, there Is another way.

At Donohoe Chiropractic, ALL the doctors use the same activator technique. With a quick exam and leg length analysis, they can determine exactly where your body needs adjusting and use the activator tool to get right to the source. It is so gentle, precise, and effective.

I’ve seen all four doctors there and they are all very nice and super knowledgeable. Dr. Donohoe cares for my two young kids and is so patient and gently with them. He sees my kids once every three months, and even then, they sometimes still don’t need an adjustment. This just goes to show how honest he is. The Donohoe’s didn’t  build a practice by getting people to believe they need to get adjusted multiple times a week. They built their practice by being, truthful, hard working people all while helping healthy families thrive.

We absolutely LOVE Donohoe Chiropractic!<//review>

<Review>We absolutely love Donohoe Chiropractic! We have seen such a great improvement in our overall health especially with our daughters. They don’t get sick as frequently and if they do it’s a mild cold, not only that but our 4 year old’s sleep has improved drastically which means Mommy and Daddy get better sleep too. My family and I have been getting chiropractic care here for about 2 years now. We see Dr. Wilder, she is awesome! Thank you.<//Review>< Pics>

My daughter somehow pulled her neck, it was locked up, and I took her to see Dr. Wilder ♥️ Literally- by the end of the appointment, she could move her neck 💪🏼
a few days later... Dr. Wilder called to check on her! which I think is so heartfelt. By her second
Appointment she was good as
New! I love the staff, and great doctors at
Donahoe.</text>

We have been going to Dr. Donohoe's for about 4 years now. He came highly recommended by a family member. I was pregnant with my first and I had never been to a chiropractor before. Dr. Donohoe answered all my question and addressed all my concerns. After my daughter was born she began seeing him too. I just had my second child and couldn't be happier. Both my pregnancies were healthy and the deliveries went smoothly. All their doctors are equally knowledgeable. I've seen Dr. Wilder as well, she's wonderful and just recently I saw Dr. Oldenburg right before I had my son. Dr. Donohoe just started seeing my son for preventive care and wellness. They also have a lactation consultant who is very knowledgeable and provides demonstration education to help you if your having trouble with breastfeeding; we were very impressed. So if your in need of chiropractic, pregnancy, or lactation services make an appointment today. Oh, and their front office staff is helpful and will offer you a delicious cup of coffee too. Thank you Dr. Donohoe and team.</text>

<Text>Dr Donohoe has been seeing my son since he was 3 weeks old and he has always been amazing to us, from helping him before and after his tongue tie release, to helping his belly issues. He is also full of knowledge you wouldn't get from another chiropractor about nutrition and how certain medications affect the bodies ability to do what it's supposed to do on it's own. He, and all his staff, are so amazing, friendly and helpful.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Donohoe is the kindest most patient chiropractor I know. He takes his time as my son warms up to him. He is extremely knowledgeable of holistic medicine. I'm so thankful we found him. His staff is always friendly and kind and willing to help in any way possible.</review>

<Review>Dr. Donohoe is very professional and thorough. He takes his time to get to know the patient and makes sure to address all concerns. He is so knowledgeable and I'm so thankful to have been referred to him! He has seen my newborn for a few visits and I'm looking forward to getting the rest of my family in for any treatment they may need.< /Review>< username>

Definitely recommended!!! We get the best care at Donohoe Chiropractic. My 3 kids have all been taken care of through their multiple sports injuries; rugby, football, motocross, baseball, gymnastics, etc. You name it my kids have hurt it and Donohoe has fixed it. Bed wetting is a huge concern for one of my teenagers and as long as we come in regularly he is safe from that embarrassment. My husband throws his back out yearly it seems and he is always back to normal and back to work within a couple visits. I was seen during my last pregnancy and Donohoe was able to get rid of all my pain that the doctors said was just part of being pregnant. Our newborn infant was seen with the first 3 weeks of life. We also use/take a few of their supplements to keep our immune systems healthy. Thank you so much to the Donohoe team for taking care of us for all these years!!!< /review>

<Text>Just had my first chiropractic experience today with Dr. Oldenburg.  She was so sweet and knowledgeable. I loved that she spent so much time getting to know my personal body issues. My last chiropractor just did the same moves on everyone. I feel like this office wants to find the problem and fix the main cause. Donohoe Chiropractic is so much more than just a chiropractor! I feel completely confident that I am in good hands. I look forward to feeling better. As an added bonus they have delicious apple kombucha in the office.< /Text>< Rating>

<Review>Dr Donohoe and his staff are absolutely amazing!   We started seeing him about 8 months ago and are lives have truly changed for the better.   I had trouble nursing my daughter on my left breast and after Dr. D evaluated her & was able to work his magic she was then able to nurse on both breasts with no issues at all.  I am so glad I found him and his wonderful staff!!<//Review>< pictures>

I love that they offer a holistic approach with offering a variety of products to purchase over the counter for your health. Dr. Donohoe is absolutely amazing in working with my 4 yr old daughter, I wouldn't trust her with anyone else. He is also very detailed in answering any questions you may have and explaining any information about processes. My daughter loves him and asks all the time if we are going to go see Dr. D today. Myself and my husband see Dr. Wilder and love her as well, she has a very kind and warm approach, after the adjustment she always asks how you feel and checks that you are good before you leave and we love that about her, it definitely shows care and not like your 1 and done like other offices can. A huge THANK YOU to Donohoe Chiropractic for the stellar care you all provide!</Text>< UserId.>

Absolutely great experience first time here with my toddler who fell and needed an adjustment. I was nervous but they eased me quickly and the rooms with the play kitchens were a dream for making him feel comfy as well! I will be going back for myself. So lucky to have such a great practice so close to home!<//Text>

I had been to other chiropractic offices for past pregnancies and for other issues that have come up inbetween.  I am so glad I gave Donohoe Chiropractic’s office a try.  I was mid pregnancy with baby #4, looking to keep well adjusted during pregnancy and to be prepared for labor.  Their technique is so gentle compared to my other experiences.  I have never left the office with more or new pains then I went in for. Which I can’t say the same for the other offices I have been to. I even had Dr. Donohoe adjust my 2 day old.  He has so much knowledge to share he is more than just your typical Chiropractor.  My other 3 children see him on a regular basis.  I have been able to avoid unnecessary testing like x-rays and ultrasounds for them.  If your looking for a Chiropractor for the first time and are scared. This is the place to try.< /Review>

I have been coming since 2008. Dr Donohoe helped me during my first pregnancy to allow my son to turn head down so I could have the natural birth I was hoping for. I have seen him through all four of my pregnancies now and his help and care has been amazing and kept my body in such good shape during and after my pregnancies too! Dr. Donohoe has also seen all my children as patients too! He is so good with children! More recently I have also worked with the lactation consultant in the office (Kristin) and she has been an absolute God send! I will recommend everyone in the office (I have been treated by them all at some point) with the utmost confidence in their care for me and my family!< /text>

<Text>Dr. Donohoe has been able to help me feel comfortable and aligned through both of my pregnancies. I always leave feeling so much better and now he treats my toddler as well when she has tummy issues, a big fall, or anything else, and she absolutely adores him! He has also helped me with internal gut issues after his functional medicine training so we basically go to him for everything (: It's just a bonus that his wife Veronica has also been available to chat when I have needed it and is a fountain of knowledge.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Dr. Donohoe and his associates have changed our lives for the better. I didn't believe in chiropractic care until nothing else worked. We come regularly for tune-ups and always if we get injured. It is visible that he loves what he does and truly cares.

My family has been going to Donohoe Chiropractic for almost 10 years now and I can say that with all of our visits we’ve always had a great experience. The Dr’s are amazing and very knowledgeable and the office staff is wonderful. I can say this is the only office that my four children enjoy going to see the Dr and will ask me to make them appointments. Very thankful many years ago we decided to make chiropractic care part of our health routine.<//Review>

The first time I ever went to the chiropractor was when I was pregnant and saw Dr. Donohoe. He and his staff are amazing!! I was having sciatic nerve pains in my leg and was completely shocked at the difference one visit made. The rest of my pregnancy was a breeze with the care at Donohoe Chiropractic’s. I love that they really listen to any concerns you may have and are truly there to help. I have also seen Dr. Wilder as well and think she is great too! Love this place!!</Text>

Absoulstely 5 stars! We met Dr. Donohoe at one of his community wellness talks he was offering before becoming patients. Life changing! We recently switched our chiropractic care over to him for my kids and make a long drive from out of town just to see him. My kids adore him and his care! Thank you!< /Review>

Dr Donohoe is truly gifted. Regular chiropractic adjustments during my pregnancy kept me healthy, comfortable, and ultimately lead to my 100% natural child birth. I am so thankful for Dr D and his staff. My daughter has been a patient of Dr D’s since she was 3 days old, where he helped with breastfeeding difficulties. We love Donohoe Chiropratic and highly recommend any of their doctors to everyone!<//text>

I have spent my last 15 years as a Massage Therapist working with different Chiropractors.  I honestly had lost a lot of my belief in Chiropractic after seeing how many approached and cared for their patients.   Training for marathons and having 3 kids so close together left me with lots of aches and pains.   I had to do something so I reluctantly went to Dr. Donohoe.   I barely mentioned that I was there for some low back pain because I always like to see how they do their evaluation.  Without an X-ray, after Dr. Donohoe did his, he pointed out EVERY single part of my body that I had an issue with, down to the small bone in my ankle, that I truly didn’t even consider getting addressed.   After my adjustment, I walked out of that office PAIN FREE for the first time in 20 years!!! I didn’t think I’d ever know what that would feel like again.  It stuck too! I stayed that way for 6 months!  I began to stay in touch and see just how much this office has to office it’s patients and the community.   This is the ONLY Dr. referral I have ever been willing to give out.   I’m fully confident any and all who walk through their doors is on the path to wellness.<//text>

I didn't go in with many chiropractic needs/issues. I expected to just go in and get adjusted with some pops and movements. When I showed up I was greeted with smiles and quick, friendly service. Then my adjustment consisted of laying on a table, small touches and foot movements. And then adjustments as needed with a "activator" device the size of a drill that clicks and does the minimally invasive adjustments instead of the cracks and pops. I honestly didn't expect it to be effective at first but walked away feeling great. I now feel great and I have now been going back regularly ever since. And they provide much more than just chiropractic Care. I had no idea.<//Review>

<review>My three year old son is a patient of Dr. Donohoe. My son has or should I say HAD severe eczema. He was extremely swollen, had scabs from itching everywhere, his eyes and lips were peeling, and he would leave blood stains on the couch and beds from his severe break outs.
Before coming here, we had seen multiple doctors and specialists over the past TWO years. I was reassured over and over again that my sons condition had nothing to do with food or gut health and they would continue to prescribe him stronger and stronger steroid creams. I had one doctor even tell me “you can’t test food allergies through blood work”. They made me feel crazy and hopeless.
Not only did Dr. Donohoe listen, but he genuinely cared about the health of my child. I was brought to tears my first visit, knowing my son was FINALLY in loving hands. Not only did we get to the root of the problem, but it was solved with lab work, diet change, adjustments and supplements. It’s only been a month, but it has literally been life changing for my son.  No more sleepless nights, no more hearing my son scream in pain that his skin is burning.
Not being able to help your child is a feeling I cannot explain. I will forever be greatful to this practice and as long as we are living in Southern California, we will be coming back!<//review>< resp>

Took my 3 year old twin girls to see Dr. Donohoe almost two weeks ago.  One needed some attention in her hips which has made a big difference in the way she's walking and running.  My other daughter needed attention in her upper body and neck area.  Another interesting thing Dr. Donohoe let my husband and I know is that the part of the brain that helps with speech needed some tending too as well. We have seen a great difference in her  speech. She has been using more words and putting together more sentences than before!  I'm so glad we found him!  If you have had any doubt before about chiropractic I suggest you give it at try!  Thank You Dr. Donohoe!</Text>

<review>We feel so incredibly blessed to a part of the Donohoe practice! My 1.5 year old daughter sees Dr. Donohoe. My daughter struggled with eczema when she was about 8 months old, she was EBF and Dr. Donohoe recognized that it may have been something in my breast milk. I did the blood allergy test and it was discovered that I had a slight candida overgrowth. He suggested the anti-candida diet and some specific supplements for my daughter and myself and her eczema cleared up completely within two weeks and it hasn't been back! We are so thankful for the holistic care provided! I recently saw Dr. Valerie Oldenburg and I absolutely loved her! She took her time getting to know me and my health history, I can't wait to see her again next week! All of the doctors are just wonderful! And, the office staff is so friendly and helpful as well, just all around a wonderful experience!< /review>< time>

I cannot begin to express how much I love the care and devotion this practice provides. From regular and prenatal adjustments for myself, to adjustments for my babies, and adjustments for my husband and his lower back pain, we just love it. We can notice a difference when we go too long without an adjustment. My son is a typical 4 yr old who falls hard and plays hard, at one adjustment his feet were off by over an inch! After his adjustment, he slept better and had a better overall attidude and appetite. My labors have been shorter and actually enjoyable due to having adjustment's throughout my pregnancies. Oh, and the lactation help is amazing too! I can't recommend this office enough. You will feel cared for and heard, not just another patient or number.< /Review>

Doc Donohoe has been in my life for almost 8 years. He was so kind and patient with me during my pregnancy. I had so much back pain and new mom nerves. He helped both. Fast forward to now and my 7 year old son has been seeing him and his staff since birth. Doctor Wilder is now overseeing my sons care and she is wonderful. Listens to all my questions and takes time to talk to my kiddo and make him comfortable. This office is one of our favorite  places.</Review>

<Text>Dr.D is a wealth of knowledge. I had my first appointment with him when I found I was pregnant (at 9 weeks) now every time I go in there I learn something new that will benefit me through my pregnancy, labor, or with a newborn. I have been able to avoid any form of medication for aches and pains from being adjusted. I am concord the reason I have had such an easy pregnancy is because of Dr.D. Thank you to everyone at Donohoe Chiropractoc. I truly appreciate all of you</Text>< pics>

The staff at Dr. Donohoe's office are awesome and always helpful and pleasant. Dr. Donohoe himself has the best bedside manner and it is obvious he is passionate about what he does. He is beyond knowledgeable and that put me at ease immediately upon meeting him to treat my infant.. I started seeing Dr. Donohoe as well and it is so refreshing to have a Dr that doesn't just snap, crackle and pop you. He goes the extra mile and it shows. Now that I think about it, the extra mile is actually just probably his standard of care. It seems to far surpass other offices I have been to. Definitely would recommend him.< /review>

My kids have been seeing Dr. Donohoe for about 7 years.   They are healthy and they don't easily catch colds or bugs that go around.  I believe 100% it is due to excellent chiropractic care.  Everyone on staff is kind and educated.  I am so grateful to have this local resource to keep my kids healthy and well.</review>

I love Dr. D and Dr. W!  I've been seeing Dr D since I was pregnant 9 years ago and he was amazing! I credit him and his help with my being able to have a great pregnancy.  I would hobble into the office and be able to walk out comfortably after my adjustment. He even made a house call to check our new daughter and myself after a very long birth.  I've been coming in since then for both myself and my daughter and seeing both docs. It's especially helpful for my daughter to come in to see Dr Wilder after horseback riding lessons! I've learned a lot and recommend Donohoe Chiropractic to friends all of the time!< /Review>

< Review>
I really wanted to call the office this evening and thank Dr. Donohoe, but the office is currently closed so this is the next best option. I am currently 5 months pregnant with my fourth pregnancy and have been experiencing a lot of lower back pain. My midwife had recommended that I find a prenatal chiropractor. I came in today for my first appointment. Most of the symptoms I've been experiencing, I didn't even mention in my appointment or write down on the initial paperwork as they are really typical pregnancy related issues (appetite, digestion, energy, mood) that I've dealt with with each pregnancy and not anything I thought would/could be alleviated during pregnancy. After the initial examination, the doctor pointed out problem areas I hadn't even remembered or thought to mention as well as the areas I came in to have addressed. He worked a little adjustment magic and my back immediately felt better which was a huge relief. Over the course of the day though, I've noticed so much more. After a month of stomach issues and no appetite, my stomach felt 100% better and I found myself feeling ferociously hungry. I have energy that I haven't felt since pre-pregnancy and my back doesn't hurt tonight for the first night in months. Instead of the typical pain and exhaustion I always feel at my kids bedtime, we danced and played. I'm really looking forward to my next visit and am looking forward to continuing treatment over the course of my pregnancy.< /Review>

<Text>Dr. Donohoe is the best!  I took my 3 month old baby because he was a preemie and suffered from reflux.  After the first appointment it was like a brand new baby, he started sleeping better and his reflux symptoms started to improve.  I also started seeing him to help my own issues and I have been feeling great.  I highly recommend this Chiropractic office.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I'm so glad to have found this office! My AMAZING lactation consultant, Kristen Davis, works out of this office and introduced us to Dr. Donohoe(whom is amazing as well!)
After many painful weeks of breastfeeding and many visits to unskilled practitioners and uncertified LC's, I finally found Kristen and learned that my 6 week old has a lip and tongue tie!  Kristen has helped with breastfeeding tremendously!  She and Dr. Donohoe have been so helpful in preparing us for my DD's release procedure coming up this Monday.  Both Kristen and Dr. Donohoe could not be more knowledgeable about infants, their anatomy, breastfeeding, and just everything baby. They are gentle and encouraging and are experts in their fields.
I would recommend this office to my closest family members and fully trust both practitioners.
If you are having any issues with a fussy baby or difficulty breastfeeding that aren't bring addressed by your pediatrician, pay this office a visit! You will NOT be disappointed!! You will only wish you found them sooner!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

What a wonderful place! The staff is so nice and the office is beautiful! But most of all, Dr Donohoe is so knowledgeable!!! I took my infant to him, and within a few visits he was happy and healthy. He had a tramatic delivery via ceserian and Dr Donohoe was able to correct a few things very gently! Within no time we were back to health! So thankful for him!< /text>

The absolute BEST DOCTOR EVER!!!!  From the moment you walk in The staff greets you with a smile, they are so friendly. Dr. Donohue is just amazing to say the least! Hes so patient and so full of knowledge. He takes his time to answer all of my questions. My Daughter is the type to cry bloody murder at every appointment she has, yesterday she saw him for the 3rd time and she was a little nervous but warmed up to him and hardly any tears were shed!!! I love Dr Donohue and his team. You will not regret bringing your little ones and yourself here. My daughter will keep coming here for life!! Thanks Dr Donohue you are awesome!!!!!!<//text>

She still had a very tense, tight jaw and I saw an immediate improvement after her sessions. She only needed two and I really liked that he didn't try to push me to bring her more often. He explained everything to me in terms that made sense. He also called me personally the morning after her first session to check in! He really has a way with babies and you can tell he loves what he does. I paid out of pocket and it was certainly worth every penny! Not to mention all the great supplements and holistic meds available in office. My husband was having insomnia and I was able to get him some magnesium spray that totally helped. Oh and their elderberry syrup is perfect! I could go on and on...<//Text>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>Oh, where do I begin with how amazing this practice and family is? Everyone who goes here is truly cared for and treated like family. I've brought my son for adjustments since he was an infant, and all the doctors have always treated him with care and tenderness.

When I got a shoulder injury and couldn't carry my 3 month old son, I was even given an emergency appointment after hours. I was able to pick him up the next day and feeling 100% in 3 days. That's when I truly believed in the power of chiropractic.

I've been to about 10 different chiropractors, and I've never experienced what I experience at Donohoe Chiropractic. I'm not told to come in 1-2 times a week, forever. I'm given the care I NEED and nothing more. They truly aren't in it for profit and to scam people but instead to help heal people and get them in better health. The adjustments are done differently than I was accustomed to, as well. Instead of cracking and popping my body in uncomfortable that rarely left me feeling better, they use the activator method and leg length analysis to actually get to the root of the issue in as few sessions as possible. And it truly leaves you feeling great!

We moved out of state, 1.5 years ago, but we visit family in the area often. We love this family and practice so much, that every time we visit, we are sure to book appointments to see our favorite chiropractors!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I love that they don't manipulate. They use an activator that gently taps each bone back into place. I am taken back within seconds of arriving and fee like I get great attention. Came in here for a knee cap being out of alignment and am so glad I didnt go to urgent care for x-rays and MRIs!!! Love the full body healthy approach!<//review>

<Text>Highly recommended!  Donohoe Chiropractic (we have seen both Dr Wilder and Dr Donohoe) have been amazing with helping treat my two kids. My daughter had major digestive problems and was diagnosed with failure to thrive even at one point, but both Dr Wilder and Dr Donohoe helped us get to the root cause of her problems with adjustments, labs and dietary changes. She is thriving and we continue to come in for adjustments every so often. My son has just started with Dr Wilder for adjustments to help with hip and leg pain.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmap_id>

I highly recommend the Donohoe Chiropractic office, ESPECIALLY if you’re pregnant! I got sciatica really badly in my left leg and popped my hips out of place while working my physically active job. My OB office just told me to take Tylenol and didn’t even ask me to come in to be checked out. Dr. Oldenburg was able to quickly tell me what the problem was and work on fixing it. I had to wait 1-2 weeks to get in because they are in such high demand but I felt IMMEDIATE relief and constant improvement each time I returned. I went from not being able to walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night to feeling almost no “typical pregnancy back pain.”

If you’re pregnant and your back or legs are hurting and people brush it off as “just part of pregnancy” you need to know it doesn’t have to be that way! Go see Donohoe or one of the other doctors (Oldenburg is mine!) and you’ll be so happy you did!

They will also help you find out if your health insurance covers it!< /Text>

The staff at Donohoe Chiropractic are friendly, professional and always smiling. They are the most helpful when it came to my chiropractic needs. I recommend this office to anyone looking for relief from any type of back pain or discomfort. The massage therapists that work out of this office are great as well. Treat yourself to a massage. Schedule when you are feeling tense, float out of the office on cloud 9.</text>

<text>I have been seeing Dr. Wilder for a little over a year now for my hip and knee pain. It’s amazing how I feel after she adjusts me. I have also seen her for sinus issues while sick along with my toddler for sinus adjustments as well. My 3 year old has seen both Dr. Wilder and Dr. Donohoe for her tip toe walking and I can see an immediate change in her walking afterwards. They are both very patient and knowledgeable. There is never a long wait time. Their office is always very clean and organized. They have a kid friendly room, which is great for my very active toddler. In addition, their stock of natural products is so convenient for my family, including Mrs. Donohoe’s delicious organic elderberry syrup! I would highly recommend their office for every ailment.</text><Date>1547778893425< /Date><name>Leslie Aranda< /name><UserId.>109222788340372363300</UserId.>< rating>

Took our two month old in because he was having some difficulty nursing on the right side. Was told by several friends about Dr Donohoes practice and his medical staff and was skeptical. He did an amazing job explaining everything step by step, noticed immediate improvement the same night, dr made a follow up phone call and sincerely cared. Highly recommend for anyone seeking alternative treatment</text>

<Text>Dr. Donohoe and Dr. Wilder have been an absolute blessing to our family. The staff is also amazing at getting back to me when I call or if I need an appointment ASAP. I recommend everyone here and my entire family sees both of them as well.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>My experience at Donohoe is nothing short of a miracle! 2 torn meniscus 8 months of agony and my treatment with Dr. wilder saved me from invasive knee surgery twice!🥺 she has been re alligning me for the last year and I could not live without this office. The ladies are sweet, helpful. I don’t need weekly treatment and that is a bonus. I would never go back to traditional chiropractic, this is the future of internal holistic chiropractic medicine. Give it a try and don’t look back. 😊<//text><gmapID>0x80dc824a378761a7:0xa307bdbf9595210</gmapID><Date>1545152057191<//Date><user_id>117540506021584112925</user_id>< response>

Our daughter was suffering from migraines at the age of 10. One day it was so bad she was laying on the bathroom floor vomiting. I called Donohoe’s office and they saw her right away. His gentle adjustments made us very comfortable and her migraine went away. This was 4 years ago. Our family continues to visit the Donohoe office on a regular basis. The staff is amazing and your not just another patient. The Staff really care about your over all health and well-being.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>My children and I have been seeing Dr. Donohoe and Dr. Wilder for about six months or so now and we have been more than impressed with our results.

My son (5) has struggled with night terrors and Dr. Donohoe keeps those at bay by keeping him in tip-top shape, and that’s huge to help him and the rest of my family sleep restfully at night!

My daughter (2) has been getting a regular adjustment since birth and when we moved to the area we made sure to get her in With Dr. Donohoe and keep her healthy. Every time she seems to be grabbing at her ears or seeming to start getting sick, I make sure to get her seen and we are able to avoid sickness!

For myself, I always feel like a new person, light on my feet and feeling 100% after an adjustment! I struggle with upper back pain and a slipping rib, both of which feel amazing and pain-free after Dr. Wilder does her magic!

I HIGHLY recommend bringing your whole family in to be seen by Dr. Donohoe and his staff to get and stay healthy!< /Text>< pictures>

Dr. Donohoe made time in his busy schedule to treat her within a 24hr period of me reaching out. After the 1st adjustment, she burst into tears because she simply could not  believe the improvement and relief she was experiencing. She then saw Dr. Oldenburg for two follow up adjustments and was back to work after the 3rd day of treatment. All of this with no ER visit or meds. Veronica Donohoe, Dr. Donohoe, and Dr. Oldenburg all followed up to see how she was doing multiple times, because they truly care. She is now seriously contemplating her current career path as a RN, and looking into applying to a chiropractic  school that Dr. Donohoe recommended. In other words, they truly heal and change lives at Donohoe Chiropractic 🙏🏼♥️😇🕊<//Review>< time>

I went for regular chiropractic appointments throughout my preganancy and had a much easier pregnancy than my first. I take my kids in when the need arises. Helps with ear aches, and typical childhood injuries. My daughter was walking for a month or so with a turned in foot and it was fixed in one adjustment never to return:)<//Text>

<Date>1548366836782<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Dr Donohoe (and his entire team) has changed our lives. We started seeing Dr D in 2013 after a series of illnesses my 7mos old was experiencing. A dear friend suggested we try an adjustment instead of another round of antibiotics for an “ear infection.” It was like pure magic! My screaming infant was smiling & back to nursing like a champ before we even left the office. We have been back for regular adjustments, sick adjustments and everything in between. I also saw him through my entire second pregnancy and my experience was night & day compared to my first.
Dr Donohoe and his team are a wealth of knowledge and so very kind & patient. I suggest Donohoe Chiropractics to all of our friends - from newborns to adults.</Review>< response>

My daughter and I went in and got adjusted and we were treated like royalty! Both doctors were very thorough and explained the entire process and when we left, we both felt like we were walking on air! She was treated for general adjustment for an athlete and I was treated by Sarah Cathers for some back and chest pains from a rib being out. I cannot believe the difference it made. Everyone in the office was friendly and I felt like they celebrated our victories with us as we left, not to mention delicious kombutcha on tap! We both got phone calls the next day to check in on us, which was unexpected, but a rather pleasant surprise. It’s the little things that make all the difference, and we will surely be back!</text>

<Text>Probably the best decision I’ve made in a few years concerning my back. In September, I had numerous back issues that resulted in an ER visit where all I got was a shot for severe pain. Made me loopy and I was out 2 days. Still not fixed, The next day I went to Dr Donahue ‘s practice. I walked in leaning heavily on my right side. Couldn’t stand straight at all. After the session, I tel you, I walked out straight and was ready to do cartwheels. After a few weeks I was severe pain free and really mobile. I went 1 month without a visit and no pain. Now in dec the pain is creeping up but I’m ready for a monthly visit ( which is what we will do to be pain free and mobile)!  The staff is great friendly and caring. And Dr Wilder is amazing. She’s even seeing my teen son for his back pain ( sports and work Injury). Trust me. It’s the best $$ I’ve spent on my pain issues, something pain meds haven’t done for me for a long time now.<//Text>< resp>

<Review>I love this place! They are always going out of their way to help you with anything you need or answer questions you have. Dr. Donohoe is very kind and knowledgeable. I started going earlier this year with my second pregnancy because I wanted to increase my chances of having a successful VBAC. Towards the end of my pregnancy I had extremely bad back pain, to the point where I couldn’t walk. After a visit to Dr. Donohoe, I walked out of the office with no pain and walking like a I didn’t have a huge belly in front of me. I was also able to have a successful VBAC and what felt like easy birth compared to my first. He was also a great support in being able to successfully breastfeed my son and connected me to the right people when he saw he had a tongue/upper lip tie. I highly recommend this place!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

My newborn was having nursing issues and lost almost too much weight. I was determined to continue nursing. I was referred to Dr. Donohoe by my lactation specialist (I had already heard amazing things about him and the work he does!) for a possible tongue tie and a recessed mandible. Dr. Donohoe explained his method of treatment thouroughly and made sure all of my questions were answered before he made any adjustments. While performing the adjustments he walked me through each step explaining what he was going to do and how it would help our little Jaxon. I walked out of his office with so much hope that we could correct his issues with chiropractic care, and I honestly saw positive results with baby’s next feeding! I would and will recommend Dr. Donohoe to all of my mommy friends! Thank you soo much for giving us hope and results Dr. Donohoe! It means the world to us for me to be able to nurse our little man! 💙< /Review>

Love Dr.Donohoe and all.his amazing staff. I've been taking my daughter to him on and off for a little over a year now and he is amazing with her. He is very soft spoken and great with kids. She was soo scared the first time there then after that she loves going to him( she even plays at home like she is taking her babies to him)  and she knows he helps make her random fevers go away almost instantly and makes her better.. I cannot rave enough about how much we like dr donohoe!!!!< /review>

Dr Cathers was awesome! She took her time and listened to all my concerns and immediately addressed them all... As she was fixing me up she explained in detail as to what she was doing and why and what I would feel. And I can honestly say that with just my 1st visit I feel so much better! Almost all of my pain is gone. I haven’t gotten a head ach as of yet. And I slept like a baby last night. I feel like a new man today. So thank you for taking such great care of me! And the entire staff was awesome! Very nice and friendly they all Made me feel at home. I’m glad I found this Gem and I can’t wait to go back again next week for my 2nd visit... I highly recommend this establishment to everyone. I will definitely advise all my family and friends and customers... You all are awesome! Thank you!
FYI my wife thanks you too!

Not only did he help so our baby girl turned after 2 visits, him and Dr. Wilder have been there for our family of 6 ever since. From, my back pain, to my husbands recovery of a ruptured achilles, to keeping all of our athletic kids strong and healthy. We are so blessed and thankful for all they do for us.

Dr. Donohoe and his staff are pure joy. When you step into this peaceful practice, you know you are there to receive health. Many times when you go to your doctor, you know that you will probably have to glean thru the advice and prescription suggestions to see what meds you are comfortable with taking (usually none). With Dr. Donohoe and his staff, I know with confidence that every suggestion for my children is for their true health and not just a prescribed Big Pharma bandaid. Even my little guy loves coming here and he usually cries when he is being seen by a doctor. Thank you, Donohoe’s, for a life giving  practice in our community!</review>

<Review>I was honestly a skeptic of chiropractic  treatment, but after several visits to Dr.  Donohoe I have completely changed my mind set. I went from having back pain on most days to rarely having any issues.  His office staff is very friendly and professional.  His services are swift and effective. I highly recommend Dr. Donohoe to anyone.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
This practice is an invaluable resource to the community. I found Dr. Donohoe just a few days after I learned I was having twins. I wanted to do the best I could to carry them full term and have a natural delivery. There is no “cracking” like a typical chiropractor, but the method works. I suffered from severe PSD, and one day it got so bad I couldn’t walk. I went in there in cruthes and left walking out. He eventually healed my PSD completely and I went on to carry my twins to full term. I was comfortable with no swelling until the very end. Unfortunately, I did have to have a Csection due to both babies being breach. But Dr. Donohoe was upfront with me from day 1 that twins were a whole different ballgame and there was only so much that could be done. I appreciated that upfront honesty and management of expectations.< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Dr. Donohoe is more than a Chiropractor!  When my son was diagnosed with GI candida overgrowth, his pediatrician and dietician did not give me adequate support or a treatment plan that worked.  We battled it for 18 months, with multiple trips back to the pediatrician, only to be left with questions unanswered and the problem not solved.  We were referred to Dr. Donohoe and he gave us a comprehensive treatment plan and email support.  The candida was GONE after 30 days!  Proven by lab test.  He has helped us continue to get through GI issues and food allergies/sensitivities as well as keep my littles aligned and healthy. They have never had to see that pediatrician for anything again, not even for a cold.< /review>< GmapID>

Dr. Donohoe is an amazing chiropractor that truly cares about his clients and community. He is the ONLY  chiropractor in Temecula Valley's that is double credentialed as a Pediatric & Pre-Natal Chiropractic Specialist. This is extremely important to me being that I saw him during my pregnancy. I wanted someone that was credentialed and had the pre-natal experience. After having my daughter I had lower back pain. It was great to have immediate relief after seeing Dr. Donohoe. I also had him see my baby girl. He is so gentle and knowledgeable. His office is clean, staff is friendly and I always leave felling great. Thank you Dr. Donohoe for all that you do!</text>

We are blessed to have Dr. Donohoe! Before we became patients, I had always known about him and heard so much positive feedback about his practice. When i was working in the medical field before i had my son, he was always the Chiropractor that our practice would always refer to. I've also had mutliple peditriations speak highly of him. When our son was born, we needed some serious help, and knew exactly who to go to. He was colic, couldn't latch and cried 18 hours out of the day. We brought him to Dr. Donohoe when he was only 10 days old & i wish i had gone sooner. Dr. Donohoe sat down with us, took his time explaining how chiropractic care works, and showed us, on our bodies, exactly how much pressure he uses when adjusting a newborn. He also took his time listening to everything we had to tell him, & answered any questions we had. We felt confident and safe letting Dr. Donohoe assess & treat our brand new delicate baby boy. Through regular treatment, he was able to help us get a handle on our sons issues and guided us in our treatment plan decisions. It turns out my son was not colic. He had a leaky gut, TMJ, reflux and a major cows milk intolerance. Dr. Donohoe was spot on & extremely knowledgeable about every diagnosis we had. He always had an effective plan to treat. I often wonder how many other parents struggled with similar issues and how they got through it, without Dr D, we would have been so lost. We were nervous new parents who couldn't figure out what was wrong with our baby. I'm forever grateful for Dr. Donohoes care. Our son is a happy, healthy, almost one year old who really enjoys his visits with Dr. D! His partner Dr. Wilder is also fantastic. She was able to effectively help me with my back pain. She is now treating my sister for her chronic shoulder pain. My sister has never been able to find relief until going to Donohoe Chiropractic. This practice takes pride in their work. They are dedicated providers who really care about the well being of their patients.</text>

Dr Donohoe has helped EVERY member of my family become a more healthy person, but the reason we started seeing him was because my, at the time, 10 year old was suffering from migraines.  We chose an alternative to our pediatrician because I just didn't want my child on heavy medication to MASK what I felt like was a treatable issue.  So we started regular chiropractic care with Dr. Donohoe.  It was AMAZING, her migraines were reduced significantly, AND she suddely became my healthiest kid!  She didn't catch all the illnesses that all my other kids seemed to catch!  As she got older, her migraines became more frequent again, and Dr. Donohoe suggested some allergy testing to see if we could pinpoint a CAUSE...and sure enough, she is allergic to GLUTEN....under his loving guidance, my daughter is migraine free with a combination of a Gluten free diet and regular chiropractic visits.  Had it not been for the amazing care of Dr Donohoe, my daughter would be on heavy migraine meds and we would have never gotten to the real problem that was causing her pain!!!  Thank you so much Dr. Donohoe....you are amazing and I am so blessed to have you care for my family!!!!!< /Review>

I do this kind of thing when children are experiencing challenges with nursing. I will drop everything to help an infant with problems breast feeding. I apologize if you felt pushed into any treatment plan that you were not consenting to. My office and all our doctors and staff go out of our way to ensure that patients are educated and given the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about their care or finances before we provide any service. We also stand against business practices that push patients into care with scare tactics or long term treatment plans and contracts. We strive to create a family atmosphere and to treat our patients as family. Every patient is welcome to come and go as they please. It is, however, our job to make recommendations that are in the best interest of our patients. That is where it ends, a recommendation. Many of our patients choose preventative care and get evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis, others come in as needed. We work with patients in whatever capacity they are seeking to utilize our services. Whenever we experience complaints such as this we attempt to address the concern and make the situation right and to learn how we can do better in the future. In fact, 30 minutes after you posted this review my wife called you personally to address your concerns. You didn't seem to have any interest in working things out. At any rate, we wish you and your family the very best."}</Resp>

- I think I speak for all of us.

Edit: Changed from a two star, to a one star. We were all banned because of my HONEST review. My friend and I decided to take a casual stroll today through the ruins that once was the glorious Howie's Game Shack, but we were escorted out the moment we walked in. I was blatantly told that it was because of the review I had left. I couldn't believe my ears, but as I let it soak in, I realized that I wasn't surprised. My freedom of speech has been infringed upon. I have never been dishonest in my critiques, nor a nuisance within the establishment. I have been a patron of Howie's since it's opening day in 2004, and I was just bullied out of the store by an employee because I had an honest opinion.

Edit #2: They are paying massive amounts of money to censor their reviews on most platforms, not sure if this one will get through.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Sub-par management for over a decade. Was extremely out of touch with gaming for many years on the corporate front. Treated players like trash. Prices very high, turned the place from a competitive LAN into a new modern-day chuck-e-cheese. Hope they finally fired Brad. This review is by someone that was hired by Howie personally. I was there from their first day open through half a decade almost.  I also started Monster Energy Gaming  there  years before ME finally figured it out and got on board and never received ANY credit.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dceeedf5a83713:0x1239e12a91b1d276</gmap_id></record>

<Review>We spent the day at Howie's for my son's birthday. It was nice, the food was typical and staff was friendly. Only down side is headphones on xbox didn't have mic. So kinda killed it for my son. Make sure you have your xbox account ready, my daughter's gave us lot of issues and wifi service was spotty. We spent a long while getting her ready to play. VR was cool but i don't think they wipe down equipment.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Headphones on vr voice coms were not working   Controller died and was wasting time, manager said he would pause the time to give us time to eat and never did pause the time than gave us 7 minutes when it wasted 30 minutes.  They need to make sure their equipment is working and make sure they are not promising things they cannot keep. I almost made a yelp account just to warn people of the bad service but the vr games were so fun and I’m going back in the future I will not go out of my way just for a communication mistake. I just hope this does not happen again or I will have to make a yelp account.< /review><username>OVERWATCH Highlights Official</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>3< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

This place is pretty over priced, only worth it if you come with a group of friends to have a lan party experience. The manager is a prick, it's expensive, and the hardware sucks. You'll be playing on an old monitor with an older PC, cheap mouses and most of the keyboards are junk with awkward layouts. No mouse pads, old chairs. No outside food but all their food is crappy and unhealthy. BUT HERE'S THE WORST PART! you have the own most of the games to play them! Say you want to play overwatch or player unknown's battle ground on PC, you must own a copy of the game to play it. What a rip off, you have to pay $20 for a day pass to play and buy the games if you don't own them. Same for the xbox's if you want to play online you have to have your own xbox live account.

If you already have an xbox live account, coming here 3x will pay for a new game. You might as well buy a cheap 5 port switch on amazon and setup your own lan party, you could use PC monitors for your xbox.

For PC, if you have to own the game to play then you already have a PC (probably a better one) and again I would recommend hosting a lan party with friends. With 4 people paying $20 that's enough to order pizza, etc. and buy some long ethernet cables and a switch.

I've been coming to Howie's since it opened as was run by Mr. Howie himself. I was there for the Buena Park opening, waited in line hours before. Recently started coming back, not for the 144hz 1440p gaming I have at home but for the atmosphere. The manager is a total prick, everyone else that works there is alright. This place doesn't cater to the competitive gamer like it used to and you wonder why it's dead here.</Text>

Played black ops 3 and it wouldn't connect to online play. We ask them to fix it and they said play it locally. We ask for a refund and they refused. Won't be back here.<//text>

I tried this place when I first moved in the area 5 years ago & love the donuts! Breakfast croissants are pretty good too! The ladies that work there are so sweet! & now that I've moved away from the area I still drive here when I want donuts! Highly recommend!<//Text>

A coworker brought these in today and sadly the taste has put them on my “do not ever go here” list!! They taste stale and like old oil!! I see they have pretty good reviews so maybe we just got a bad batch but it’s enough for me not to go or recommend 🙁< /text>

I just moved to the area and tried Best Donut House Monday. It was so good I came back Saturday! We tried plain, chocolate, crueller, apple fritter, Bavarian cream and donut holes. The gal that helped us is very friendly, nice to my kids and the prices are fair. Highly recommend it.</review>

I like this little place. The woman that always seems to be at the front counter is really nice. The donuts are good and there's always a good selection.<//review>

If you pay close attention to the title, you will realize that there literally cannot be a better donut house. They know. They checked.</text>

I've been going to this car wash for years and have been  a very happy customer, but I wasn't happy today with my experience.  I have tires that are less than 6 months old and I had been running errands when I decided to stop for a car wash.  When my car came out of the wash it looked like it had a flat rear tire, but I thought it was a shadow and dismissed the thought, because the tires are fairly new.  While pulling out of the parking lot onto the street I noticed I was having a hard time controlling the steering and then I began to hear the "sound" of a flat tire.  I discovered a very deep gouge in the side of my tire.
I was disappointed that the attendant who cleaned and polished my tires didn't say something to me before I started driving on it.</Text>

<Review>I hate to leave bad reviews,  but I can't leave a good one if they are closed during normal operating hours. This has happened 3 times over the last year. Better off heading down the street to the place on Ellis. They are always open during posted hours.< /Review>< Pics>

Full service car wash.   Asked them to dress the tires.  They didn’t.   Car had lots of water spots.   Had to have him re wash windows on inside.</review>

We went in with a disaster of a car needed so badly for a wash and the carpet was just trashed and needing a wash as well.. They worked very hard to clean the car and the rug I was happy about the quality. I would have given ☆☆☆☆☆ but they forgot to wipe down the driver side door and no scented pray even though we asked three times ... But other wise will be back to get the car washed again...<//Review>

I almost thought this place deserves a minimum 4 stars until I saw my other side (passenger side) on next day. It was cheap, cashier lady was friendly and good location certainly deserves a minimum 4 stars, at least that's what I was going to do. The guy (washer) did a good job in cleaning my car (driver side) from where I was sitting from the customer waiting area. Unfortunately, he left the passenger side totally uncleaned. I don't know if this was intended or by a mistake. Lesson learned..make sure your do 360 walkabout of your vehicle after the wash.< /review>

I loved this place, I am surprised there have been any complaints. They are: budget friendly, professional, very thorough, and go above any other place in this price range. I have a jeep grand Cherokee with leather seats, and they have always done a good job with the interior it's major reason I drive to come here. Anyways if your looking for a nice deep clean for your car look no further!</Text>

I recommend this place for carwash. It is fast and prices are very reasonable. They have also custom carwash and they accommodate your needs. They inspect your car before they handle the key back to you to make sure everything is done correctly<//Review>

The guys here do a great job. They have recently upgraded their interior lobby. Don't forget to get a punch card. 11th wash is free.</text>

It's ok. Its a car wash. I come here only because my dog vet is in the same strip mall. It's a hit or miss. The few times I come here, the wash job can be good or leave alot of streaks. It's not a 100% hand car wash, your car does go thru a machine so we all know how that can turn out.< /Text>

We had a great time on our kayak cave tour. The sea was a bit rough when we went out, but it was still a good experience. We managed to go through some caves, and see marine wildlife very up close! The guides also take pictures of you the whole trip, and provide the pictures to you at the end of the experience. It can be tiring to kayak ~3 hours, but there's a break half-way through the tour and water/snacks are provided, which was great. We would recommend this company!</review>

My paddle did have a slight issue, there was no smiley face to remind me which side was up and it almost ruined my day. :)<//review>< rating>

<rate>5< /rate><text>My husband arranged the kayak cave tour and it was awesome! All paperwork was done ahead online. Our guide met us at the shop where there was a clean restroom and curtained change areas. Andrew greeted us and had all our gear ready to go. They provided booties, Farmer John wetsuits, long sleeve rash guards, wind proof splash guards and PFDs. We took a short walk to the beach while Andrew got to know us a little and where our kayaks were already waiting. Andrew gave us a thorough briefing as to what to expect and how to handle the ocean swells and waves and how to re-enter our kayaks safely should we end up in the water. He then got us all launched through the surf. Once on our way, we would periodically re-group and Andrew would tell us what the next challenge would be (tunnel, cave)and advise how to best navigate it. He also gave us info about the many pelicans, seals, otters, oyster catchers and commorants that we passed by on the rocks.

Yes, it was challenging for flat water kayakers as ourselves, as the seas got quite bumpy and we got wet and cold, but Pat and I were both comfortable with Andrew’s judgement, safety instincts and water skills.

After a decent paddle back to our exit point, we were greeted by Andrew’s colleagues who assisted us in landing safely through the surf and rocks. After a short drive back to the shop, we were changed, dry and off to lunch and wine tasting! The great surprise was that the many great photos that Andrew had taken along the adventure were uploaded and sent to us as soon as we were back at the shop!

Thanks, Andrew and the crew at Central Coast Kayak for a beautiful paddle! We definately will be returning!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1622077592031, 'text': 'Thanks for paddling with us! We hope you enjoy the Central Coast.'}</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>These guys do a great job. They are patient, funny and fun. Khristian and Heather were our guides and were fantastic! It isn't a waste of time if you want a fun, kayak/cave adventure. Great value!

My paddle did have a slight issue, there was no smiley face to remind me which side was up and it almost ruined my day. :)</Review><userid>109664223610619717116< /userid>< rate>

We rented kayaks from here and couldn't have enjoyed the experience more.  The owner (I tried to remember your name...sorry) was friendly and helpful.  The crew at the beach were also great.  It was one guys first day and he had worn long pants...very funny guy and really friendly.  He got smashed by a wave bringing in my wife.  He was soaked and she was as dry as could be.  Nice work man.  Thanks!!< /text>

We went on the ocean cave Adventure. It was phenomenal. L Brent and Libby were terrific guides, we had so much fun learned a lot about the area and just had a blast. We went through a lot of caves, when the Whitecaps started up as the tide came in if they can a lot of fun we all made it back safely, everybody had a great time. Very highly recommended</review>

My friend and I did the cave tour - it was amazing!  Nick was our guide, very knowledgeable, patient, and a great teacher.  The staff at the store were amazingly helpful and pretty stinking funny too!  Would definitely recommend, and would love to go back with my family - thanks for a great adventure!</Review>

<Review>Very nice experience. The trainer was very knowledgable about the water conditions and gave very good instructions before the ride to get us prepared. There are some really scenic areas along the way. On a calm day it would be a good idea to take a camera on the kayak if you have previous experience kayaking< /Review>< Time>

<Text>Although I have done a lot of saltwater fishing, I'd never been kayak fishing...until today.  Set up the trip with Kelsie (extremely professional); Tom (the owner) spent a lot of time telling me about how to fish the area and answered every question I had.  The entire staff was great and I highly recommend them.  Can't wait to fish there again.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Be careful from this vendor....not honest and shady business practices.
I went to CCK for the installation of a Yakima roof rack. When the owner John found out I didn't buy it through them he was very fussy and crusty. When he found out how much I paid for it he was quite as his was priced horribly higher. He spent an hour with his technician trying to put my rack on and was unable to do it. Said the Q7 clips were wrong. He recommended some straps and a foam pack so I purchased it from it. Come to find out....the Yakima racks he told me were wrong WERE CORRECT. We had the Yakima distributor call John and tell him how and he wanted nothing to do with it as he sold me the other system. Instead he just HUNG UP on the distributor! I then took my Yakima racks to another dealer and they put them on no problem. While I was there having John at Central Coast Kayaks "try" to install my racks I heard a customer walk in irritated saying that the racks were sold "used" and I heard the owner John saying "oh no they are not used". Either way horrible customer service, pricing and knowledge.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Good experience overall, but I wish the crew members had exercised better judgement when it came to kayaking near the rocks.  One of the guides went into a cave and could not get out bc of how powerful the waves were at the time.  Instead of conceding that it was too dangerous for inexperienced kayakers, the guide ushered in my boyfriend who subsequently tipped over and got pummeled against the rocks by the waves.  He has a fractured ankle and elbow bc of their carelessness.  My advice for future kayakers: If it looks unsafe it probably is.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I’m not a big burger eater, but this place has amazing tasting unique burgers. However, the onion rings were the jaw dropper for me. They are crisp and tasty. The dinning area is impressive along with the murals. Several tv’s to watch any game. This is my second visit and already looking forward to my next visit.

Ps recommend the gator bites😁<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>This place is exactly what Sacramento and West Sacramento needed. The best burger spot in the 916. You can actually select your meat(beef, venison, elf, buffalo, antelope, etc) and the fries are just as awesome. But it doesn't stop there as the craft beer selection beats most pubs if not the breweries themselves. Service is also incredible. So glad to have met Nick that recommended the peanut butter and jelly burger. I wouldn't have tried it if it wasn't for him and it was mind boggling awesome! The campfire Stout pared perfect with it to. Can't wait to come back.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqSmt2By-ayHeCN6uRpD16ZKVPVccPFqY-jQjH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIZYdVusUP8NGKe4cF5HjFsr0RgJQk9dFJboNB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHfEXMCE_pmLcfvw4bxAXmCgxM-SCMwyc2o1xM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><UserId.>103793650797451707251< /UserId.></record>

I ordered the bacon avocado burger. It came on a delicious toasted bun. This is a wonderfully thick burger party with 2 big pieces of bacon and a generous amount of avocado added in thin slices.
The atmosphere is not so great or I would have given 5 stars😅
The fries were perfectly crunchy on the outside, hot and chewy inside.< /Review>

The food, the beer, the service is simply the best. I've loved The Flaming Grill Cafe for years and now they're open for dine in service again after having been closed for Covid-19. I had to go get my fix of the grill and it was just as awesome as always and Odin knows how to make customers feel welcome and at home and glad they came in.<//review>

Flaming grill has been one of our favorite places to eat a burger since we moved out here.  So we decided for our first dine in meal since this pandemic started it would have to be here.  The food was great and watched Space X launch, good times.<//text>

What an awesome place. Fried artichoke was super tastey. The greens were fresh, and the fries were soft and crunchy, perfection.  Specialty burgers were excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful. Also, a very wide beer listing; a lot of California locals.</Text>

I am not that adventurous but for those that are this would be an interesting stop.  Burger toppings tasted fresh and delicious.  Side was an abundance of hot, crisp fries.  Respectable beer menu.  I would have preferred my beer served a bit colder.  Overall, good experience.</Text>< Rating>

I love this place.  Use to go to the old one off of El Camino.  The food is outstanding and the owners are sincere genuine people.  I know it's hard times for many establishments but my selfish self wishes they would open up a location in Roseville, Rocklin or Auburn area.  Camel, Gator, Elk and traditional Angus burgers are all delicious and the Chorizo Fries are my new favorite appetizer!  It's a bit costly but the burgers are large and they give you ample fries which are tasty too.  Most definitely stopping by next time I roll by the area.< /review>

Atmosphere best suited for busy times of day. Wide selection of burgers, and some healthier items as well. Didn't try the beers. Tots appetizers. Near the freeway, and easy parking. Interesting selection of meats. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful about their choices.</text>

Try your burger salad style there you won't be sorry! The portions are very generous. While visiting the area for 10 days my boyfriend & I discovered it. We went back 4 times! Each time for a different style of burger.
Yes they have regular beef, but they had wild boar, elk, buffalo & several other types of meats.
Great place, don't miss out!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Name>

The owner and staff are great! I've only ever eaten the standard meats, but the other ones sound interesting enough for me to tell other people about it and have them go, "Huh? They serve what? That sounds interesting." Anyways, definitely check it out and definitely try the different varitey of fries they got too! (P.S. the sweet fries mean they use sweet potatoes and not a sweeet sauce, but it's still pretty good)< /text>

Finally tried this place after passing by it for the longest time. Ordered a mushroom swiss burger to go. Got home and paired it with a nice glass of red wine. It was delicious and did not disappoint. I will definitely be back and will recommend to everyone. Had a beer from the big selection while I waited. Thank you Prescilla for the kindness and good service.< /text>

Definitely unique, and very tasty. Local brews and exotic meats is their slogan, and they own up to it. I tried the Bacon and Avocado Elk Burger, and absolutely loved it. Along with the very passionate service, I will go again. Hopefully they have gator in the next time!</review>

This is probably my favorite restaurant. The burgers and fries are better than anything else I find in my opinion. The staff is friendly. The beer lineup always has something new worth trying and usually local. They know my order before I finish my sentence. If you want a fancy experience this isn't the place. There are other places for that. For what it is I don't think they could improve anything. And I'm a pretty picky person. Can't wait until they open the one in Sacramento again, but the drive to west sac isn't too bad< /review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>4 stars for getting the order cooked right. Ordered the Harris Ranch beef which I trust and is flavorful. (Also did you know beef processing mfg can sell you "Made in the USA"beef that has NEVER eaten a single blade of grass in the US but is from Australia!)
Support LOCAL ranchers.

Ambience: One star.
HARD concrete bench seating while table support is made of pointy stucco type paint. No joke. One can exfoliate your heels on it and cut your knees if you bang on it. Horrible idea. Just put barbed wire there why don't you. Mural looks like from Dante's Hell which was really depressing maybe an insight into the persons mind. Purgatory.

Service: Three stars.
Slow with two staffers. Didn't acknowledge us when we walked in but they did every other customer. Good.
I won't go back but would consider getting to go. Just not a welcoming family environment.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad4089aabed9d:0x54fabed528917c3d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I started with wings - excellent, with the Flaming Sauce.  The Flaming Sauce has a really good flavor, but didn't strike me as hot, until... well, it builds a good solid burn.   I also had a little container of the Hoser Sauce for a taste test - and yes, it is manly - made my head break out in sweat.    Hot but still maintains a good flavor.   To me that is the sign of an excellent hot sauce - flavor, with a building heat, as opposed to cheap hot sauces that simply burn with no flavor.     Moving on to the burgers - I had the elk.  Again, excellent, but the challenge was, the french fries were so damn good, I was hard put to finish my burger.   Overall experience - excellent.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809ad4089aabed9d:0x54fabed528917c3d</gmap_id></record>

Food is always great and filling. Staff greeted us quickly upon arrival. Food is extremely filling I recommend cutting your burger in half you are going to need to take half of it home.</review>

I have tried the fiesta salad and it was very delicious! I will come here more often just to get it and try their other stuff. And the portion sizes are reasonable for the price no arguments there.👌🏻</Review>

If you are looking to try something different, this is your place. Extensive menu of burgers, all available in an assortment of exotic meats. Sirloin is the base, for the timid.  Elk, buffalo, wild boar, Wagu beef, these and many more are available.  The also have chicken and some vegetarian options.  They also carry an extensive menu of craft beers.  Portions are good and prices are on the high end of reasonable.  We're a family of four and with drinks and an appetizer our bill was just over eighty bucks.  Everyone left with leftovers too.</review>

<Text>With so many burger options from exotic to mixed types of beef and even vegetarian burgers and then they even have somewhere around 30 craft beers on tap many local too.

The burgers aren't small they have them from 1/3lb upto 10oz burger and they even have them topped with more ingredients from bacon, carne asada, and even gator bites, just to name a few I have tried.

The french fries, sweet potato fries, tator tots even get a upgrade if you like from garlic to asada fries to loaded tots.

If your new or even been a few times and not sure on a beer ask for sample. And then if you find what you like they even have a stamp club on them. Ask servers for details.

If you really enjoy burgers this is must try!
They even have a kids menu too!
And if you like sports they have TVs at all angles, so go get a big burger, drink and watch some tv.<//Text><time>1574754123165</time>< userid>

<Review>My wife and I had dinner there tonight, it was delicious and the server was friendly, the portion on the trio fries was very generous, enough for 2-3 people. The prices are very reasonable. I would've given them 4 stars were it not for their tables. If you have long legs like me, don't wear shorts or like me, you will be scraping your knees the whole time on the legs of the tables. Terrible design, they could've at least made it a smooth surface, not that super abrasive outdoor stucco they used.< /Review>< pics>

Bring a huge appetite, because these portions are sure to gut bust.  I could barely eat about 1/3 of my meal.  Delicious specialty burgers in a shop located off interstate 80 in Sacramento.  Looks like a good selection of craft beers on tap, but I had to drive so skipped this time around.  Prices are reasonable, ambience is simple.< /Text>

<text>Have never been to this location and it was awesome. Have been a fan of the flaming grill since the lion burger! Have taken many people to the other locations. This location is no different. Amazing service, great beer and amazing food! Sacramento is lucky to have one of these amazing places, and there's like 3! Had the bacon and blue wild boar and everything that it should be. Soooooo gooooooooooooood!

Very interesting place a little run-down but that adds to the character of the place.

The food was actually very amazing just enough of a portion to make me happy I had the catfish, which had Cajun seasoning on it, really tasty.< /Review>

Excellent, truly excellent burgers and sides, and beers! Service is fantastic. Tell them what kind of beer you like and they bring you samples to choose from. I chose a New Glory IPA and a jalepeno burger with blue cheese instead of Swiss. Upgraded to tater tots for the side. So friggin good!!!<//Text>

The best burger I ate in a long time. I didn't need to eat anything the rest of the day because of how satisfied I was. The garlic fries were ok...not like what you get at a SF Giants or 49ers game. Best burgers in town.<//Text>

I love it! If you don't eat meat they also offer a veggie burger and other vegetables. Great food and good service. But I think they can improve their wait time when the place gets really busy they need a hostess.< /text>

<review>I have been going to Flaming Grill since they were just at the North Sacramento location. I still love going there.

While I have had their burgers, it's the pastrami sandwich with the carne asada fries upgrade that are my favorite. I have never been able to finish both, but I end up finishing the leftovers for breakfast.

Last time my 15 year old and I started with the fried alligator which was really good, especially the dipping sauce that comes with it.

While I'm not a beer drinker, my coworkers who are really enjoy the variety of different and uncommon beers.

It's definitely worth the trip out to West Sacramento.</review>< Pictures>

One of my favorite places on Sacramento yup grab a burger. F.G. Has a few locations, this being the newest. It's always fun to try their exotic meats (ranging from wild boar, wagyu, elk to gator and even camel). They'll prepare things exactly how you want them and have a fantastic selection of beer on tap.< /text>

Food selection is terrific, all kinds of meats offered.   Everything tasted great service was top notch and the prices are fair.   My only complaint is the seats- uncomfortable.   Otherwise a great place to eat and a chance to eat something different for a change le the frog legs and the alligator.<//Text>

Small chain, non-corporate segment.  Murals on the walls and concrete tables and benches.  Great beer selection.  Understaffed, but the servers do their best.  Quality meat in the patty.  A bit gray and lacked char from an under temperature grill.  Carnitas burger was shy on the carnitas.  Ghost pepper fries consists of melted cheese and a sprinkle to pepper powder.  Kitchen performance would be 2 stars, but the ingredients and beer selection helps hang onto 3 stars.<//Text>

Great burger place. Burgers were cooked well, and tasted very good. I ordered the Jalapeño burger, it was alittle expensive but worth it. The have a wide variety of local beers. The atmosphere is pleasant, it sport friendly with many TVs showing sports. Waiters and waitress were superb! Came and checked on us a good amount of times and offered more water or condiments if we needed. Also, the Buffalo Burger was delicious!</Text>

<Text>The Chix Adobada fries were tasty. The habanero wings needed more flavor. In my opinion, not that it matters, I think the sauce should have been mixed with a sweeter ingredient like pineapple or mango instead of another Chile like jalapeno.

Response to owner... I said they needed more flavor, I didnt mention anything about the heat.<//Text>< pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1544325764100, 'text': 'Hi John! Glad you enjoyed the fries. Our habanero wings are meant to be spicy (described on the menu). You can also ask your server if they can mix the wings with another one of our sauces to mellow down on the spiciness. Look forward to seeing you soon!'}</Resp>< GmapID>

Way too expensive for a burger that does not come with onions, lettuce, and or tomatoes.  The flavor is just ok.  I wound never recommend this place.</Text>

Bacon and Blue burger was huge, full of thick crispy bacon and dripping with melted blue cheese.  The adobada fries and carnitas fries are big and delicious.  The on tap beer selection is immense and suverse.  *Order burgers medium rare if you want medium*< /review>

< Review>
I hadn't been to the west sac local always the El Camino, El Camino has always been excellent. Yesterday I ordered two cheeseburgers with fries and their onion strings, since they don't have rings. My burgers was very dry! The lettuce on it was disgusting no pickel and nearly no onion/tomato. The onion strings tastes like the flour coating was not cooked all the way and a weird sweet taste. The portion was enormous. The fries where good but again enormous. Overall a lot of money for bad burgers. I'd rather they have better a great quality product than a lot of poor quality.<//Review>

I am just some human, so please don't hate me or do anything against me.  I am not a professional as this is my personal, subjective view.< /Text>

The only bad thing I can say about this place.... Is that I chose poorly!  I had the elk burger. It was too gamey for me. I've eaten bear deer racoon squirrel snake rabbit ect ect! But  it was fresh.  I think this meet was frozen and shipped. But I shall return to try something else. I really enjoyed the gator bites well the ones I got. My 4 year old nephew went to town on the gator and he loved it. I did too! Oh not to mention the staff........ But they were amazing! Made sure our drinks were full. My burger wasn't how I ordered it. So the waitress took the elk burger off the bill. One of my table mates offered me half of their french dip. And it was amazing! So I definitely try this place again. If I don't like it..... Oscars is next door!</text>
