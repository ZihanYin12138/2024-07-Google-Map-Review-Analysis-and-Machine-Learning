How you doing yelpers, I wanted to send in some feed back on my experience with my departing from the Amtrack. First off it was a pleasure riding the 2112 Amtrack witch they said it was 7667, but thats not for me to understand I'm leave that for someone else that could make since of it. But my friend Scott was very kind and help me out to all my needs. Also the Gentleman in the food Cart as well. I had the pleasure of meeting Leam and his mom on the train 🚆 and that always a great thing to be able to meet friends and there love ones hut over all it was a pleasure riding with you again see you next ti.e Essing< /Text>

Love this station. It is classically one of the best Amtrak stations in the country absolutely beautiful old California style architecture. Very safe location monitoring is well done.</Review>

<Review>I just like waiting for a train here. The station architecture and the aesthetics of it all just makes me feel at ease for some reason. This station is an ideal location for the opening or end credits of a romantic comedy or drama. If you're ever passing by, don't hesitate to park your car and catch the train towards downtown LA or San Diego. You'll enjoy waiting here, at least I know I do.<//Review>< Pics>

Trains from into union station are often late here. There is a repetitive announcement on an intercom to let you know every 5 minutes. That's  great but the sometimes muffled and unclear. Also, tapping on google mas gives you a schedule right away which is nice so you dont have to download the app, but it's not usually up to date with delays. The lobby smells like the 1960's bars of asbestos and cigarettes</text>

<review>I got off AmTrak Pacific Surfliner and approached the information window. First, I spoke to a man who I had to tell to speak into the mic. He didn’t know the answer to my questions.A woman took over who also didn’t speak into the mic. I said, “Please speak i the mic. I can’t hear you.” She turned around, walking away with her back to me and LITERALLY threw her hands in the air. Wow!<//review><name>Carolyn Mansager<//name><Rating>1< /Rating>< date>

This place is horrible its dirty and very unsafe.  Its like a homeless shelter you can't even use the restrooms because you have homeless completely nude in the restrooms showering and all the stalls occupied by drug addicts injecting themselves.  Homeless sleeping in the benches, cars being broken into, illegal transactions in the parking lot.  On top of that they only have 1 security guard to cover the whole premises and only 1 janitor to clean it.  The security guard is scared to remove loiters but I don't blame him poor guy he is really out numbered. The city of Santa Ana is very corrupt.<//review>

<Time>1346799511553< /Time><Review>In general, I love taking the train. The food car, the scenery, and the slowed down pace you experience. However, I recommend avoiding any segments of travel by Amtrak buses. I was a bit leery of it, but the agent on the phone said "Oh they are not like greyhound or anything, these are Amtrak buses, very nice." Uh, not really. We left Santa Ana at midnight, or were supposed to. The driver was about 20 minutes late, no big deal I guess, my sister was waiting with my son and I for the train to arrive..and even tho Santa Ana is not the first place I would choose to be around midnite..nothing happened. The problem was after we got on..the bus driver got lost, and there we were, not on a free way or main thoroughfare, but lost, in a "bad" part of Santa Ana. Me and my son..and a few rough looking guys saying they hoped the bus didnt get 'jacked'. The driver announced over the PA system if anyone was familiar with the area and if so could they give him directions.. Fortunately, someone did, and after about 15 -30 minutes, we got back on track. Every segment of our 3 leg trip was late, which I personally do not mind much. However I DO mind being put in danger. When I finally got through to Customer Relations after getting home and spoke with Angela, she said there was no record of the driver getting lost or being late (after about 25 minutes on the phone with her looking through her different "screens'" and explaining that the buses are leased and difficult to get information on. She asked for the bus driver's name, saying they don't even know that.) She actually said the bus arrived early, and there was nothing she could do. I may take the train again, as I have had other good experiences with train only trips, but my recommendation is stay away from the buses. And if anything goes wrong, I would get names and make sure the employees report the problem, be it lateness, getting lost or what have you.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

FULL of people and great places to eat and drink. Acre pizza was excellent, and their soft-serve ice cream tasted better than the usual stuff!</Review>

What an awesome spot to grab food and do some shopping. Each spot is a bit on the expensive side but the food is really good: hearty sandwiches, loaded pizzas, lots of different breweries and tap rooms and great ice cream. You could spend a few hours here. Great for families where everyone wants to eat something different.</text>

Whether you're young, old, or somewhere in between, in nice weather this is the local hang out. It offers gourmet food and drinks at a variety of small restaurants and breweries, boutiques and the community market grocery store. There's coffee at one end, and ice cream at the other end, just a couple of minutes walking from one to the other.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I stayed at the Barlow for two nights over this past weekend. We had a lovely time. Our accommodations were the Queen Deluxe Room. It was quiet and the room was clean. It was exactly what we were looking for. My one minor note is that there was no hand soap. We mentioned at the front desk. The lovely girl at the desk said she would speak to the cleaning staff. We arrived back and our room still did not have hand soap. We just wound up taking it off of the cleaning staff's cart. In the grand scheme of things, it was not a big deal. I would definitely stay here again. The location was perfect.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

If you’re a local, you may agree with me: kinda dull unless there’s live music and ... where the %<?! did the nitro ice cream place go? Not to worry: Off to Screamin’ Mimi’s I go!</review>

<Review>Neat little side-downtown to Sebastopol. Upscale and pricey shops/eateries but a nice place to walk around. Beautiful edible landscaping that is very well maintained. Great breweries. Most places close pretty early, even on the weekends.<//Review><Name>Laurel F</Name><rating>4<//rating><pics>None< /pics></record>

This is a really cool concept.  To be fair most of the shops/restaurants are pricey but it's an enjoyable place to window-shop and walk around.</Review>

Looks like an old warehouse district but it feels like Downtown Disney.  Everything looks overpriced and it all closes at 6pm #fakedowntown<//text>

Don't come here if you're looking for "normal" burgers, however.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808430a7c331d385:0xb6a211a5b2631096< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Service: It was a walk up and order type of service. They were super helpful with helping you decide what you wanted.

Drinks/Crepes: The crepe itself is very good! We got the green tea crepes. Nice and fluffy but also crispy at the same time! Oh, did I mention all of their ingredients are organic?! We also go the sparkling lemonade! That was super refreshing.

Place: Got kind of lost with the GPS. However, this place is super cute! Only 3 tables though, so don't bring a big group.< /text><Time>1435388394281</Time>< user_name>

< Review>
This is my favorite japanese style crepe place. I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. First time was in 2011.

Toppings and ingredients are always fresh. The creeper batter is always amazing, lots of flavor and the right amount of chewiness to lightness.

Prices can get high if you build your own crepe, but the location is in Beverly Hills..

I always get the Nutty Banana with earl grey crepe but they no longer have the earl grey. A little disappointing but they have other great choices.

Staff is friendly, and the place is quite small. So, if you catch it at a busy time, it's tough to move around.</Review>

Harajuku Crepe has no competition. It is absolutely the best place to get crepes. It's a small place. Service is quick. Food is fabulous!< /Text>

I really loved their crêpes. It was the perfect mix. It is definitely something for people with a sweet tooth. I would love to give 5 stars but the guy who worked there was not helpful at all and seemed to be either hungover or just not in the mood to talk to the costumer in the morning.</Text>

The smell of Nuttella perked  my interest, so I strolled into the store to try out their crepes. I waited about  five minutes for someone to take my order. No one greeted me or took my order even though they clearly saw me, and there was only one other customer waiting for his food so I just walked out. Crepes look good but unfortunately the staff was not very friendly.<//Review>

Cute Japanese ice cream shop.

I fell in love with this place ever since my friend, Emily, posted a pic of her icecream crepe on Facebook.

Her or my other friend warned me that it looks better than it tastes and she was right.

It's a cute place to go but the quality of the ice cream wasn't amazing enough for me to want to come back for more. Great for foodie-photo-addicts like me :)</Review>

I had a Harajuku Crepe in Japan and this place in Beverly Hills tasted better!! :) I'm impressed! :D

This is a cute little cafe in Beverly Hills. There are about 2 small tables and a couch for seating. The guy who makes the crepes is Japanese and is really nice!

If you're here, you gotta try a crepe. You can also order boba or tea too. How it works is that you get to customize your crepe by which type of crepe you want, fruits, toppings, fillings, and/or ice cream. And with each thing you choose, there's a cost.

What I got:
-Earl grey crepe $3
-Strawberries $1
-Whipped cream $0.50
-Nutella $0.50
-Green tea ice cream $0.50

Total: $6 (Totally worth it!!)

The crepe was thin and perfectly cooked! Everything was well-portioned and wasn't too sweet.

Only downside is the parking. You gotta try to find a meter or park in one of the public lots/garages.

Overall, I am a fan and will definitely be back! A great place for dessert!< /Text>

The menu is create your own, with each topping ranging from $0.50 - $1.00. I came here for the the early Grey crepe, which sets it apart from other crepe places.  I topped it off with red beans,  big mochi balls,  and black sesame ice cream.  First bite,  amazing! You can actually taste the Earl Grey flavor.  Their ice cream and mochi balls were delicious.  If you're in the  area,  definitely stop by and support this small business.<//Review>< rating>

This place is so damn good!

I've been wanting to try this place for the longest! We had dinner on the Westside and decided to save room to try Harajuku Crepe for dessert.

We shared an original crepe filled with fresh strawberries, green tea ice cream, and nutella. It was so good that sharing was hard. I wanted it all to myself!

Finding this place was a tad frustrating. It was nighttime so it was dark and hard to see the sign. We kept missing it! JFYI, it's located right next to Vidal Sassoon. Parking sucks too! BUT you can park at the Beverly Gardens. It's metered parking and free after 8PM.<//Review>

Don't really understand what the hype is around Harajuku Crepes. Came here on a Saturday 15 minutes before closing and was amazed by how affordable these crepes are, and the option of choosing sesame and earl grey crepe batter. But after asking the cashier, I decided to stick with the original batter, since it was most popular. Included in the crepe, I had banana, sheet of mochi, nutella, and almonds (they ran out of whipped cream). The crepe itself was $3, and the toppings ranged form $0.25 - $1. Mine came out to be $6-7.

When I received my crepe, I noticed how small it was and how little toppings it came with... No wonder why it was so cheap! Secondly, just from holding the crepe, I already knew it wouldn't be good (or as good as other crepes I've had), because it wasn't the crispy crepe. It was really soft, like a pancake, which I'm not really a fan of.

It wasn't a "bad" crepe per se, but just not my cup of tea. I probably wouldn't come back...< /Review>

<Text>I came here with a group of 9 on a Friday night. I got a matcha crepe with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and mochi. It came out to be $6. The crepe was rather smaller than other places, but still pretty good. The mochi was wrapped within the edges of the crepe, allowing me to eat ice cream and mochi in every bite.

One downside is that the place is rather small, so there wasn't much seating and we ended up standing outside to eat the crepes. In addition, waiting for the crepes took a while, especially considering the size of the crepes and the lack of customers while we were there.

Parking is also hard to find. Had to park near a park a block away.

Overall, not a bad crepe place, but definitely have had better with faster service.

Note: There is a minimum credit card charge of $6.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The owner developed his skills at a creperie in Japan, and invented his own recipe for this venture. The not-so-secret ingredient that makes the crepes here extra special is MOCHI powder! It makes the crepe itself slightly thicker than French style crepes while still maintaining the fluffy softness we looove.

What's also great is the selection of flavors--original, green tea, earl grey and buckwheat (yes, buckwheat!)--ensures that you're never going to get bored of the menu. Since they're very generous with their toppings, the finished crepes are often monstrous.

Finally, a worthy successor to the now defunct crepe nazi on Sawtelle!</review>< Response>

<Gmap_id>0x808f9dd90268c879:0xf954be96b03a60c0<//Gmap_id><review>Many groups share the facilities here. in the parking lot is relatively small given the size of the facility. If a large group has arrived first, then you may need to park a block or two away from the facility, given that street parking is of course taken up by people who live in the neighborhood.

They've completely redone the athletic fields, replacing them all with artificial turf. It appears that a really nice job was done.

The complication is that the turf has been constructed with an infill product that appears to be different than cork or rubber -- possibly something like ground up nutshells or something similar.
In my first game as a coach at the facility, eight players across the two soccer teams ended up with abrasions on their hips, elbows, and forearms after they fell and scraped themselves on the ground. Think something akin to rug burns. I've played and coached on multiple other artificial turf fields, and never seen more than two or three scrapes like this over an entire season.
If you're a coach of teams that will play on this field, definitely bring the extra large size bandages with you to your games.< /review><username>Donald Nagle< /username><response>None<//response></record>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Restrooms! Baseball diamond and other playing fields. Two gated play areas for smaller children to play in that get shade in the afternoon, and a swimming pool open in summer. The recreational center offers programs for everyone: preschoolers, teenagers, and adults. The parking lot is fairly large, too. Been coming here for nearly three years and never had a problem: it is safe, clean, and everyone is polite/friendly.<//Review><Name>Kelly Graham Runge< /Name><gmapID>0x808f9dd90268c879:0xf954be96b03a60c0<//gmapID><date>1437762465106<//date></record>

Well, it is a lovely little park within walking distance of my office. Went over there with my dog to give him some exercise since he had been cooped up in the office all morning. Me, the dog in the field, and a woman with two kids on the playground. Dog was running around with a stick. No one was bothered, because there was essentially no one there. Went to leave and out of nowhere there is a Park Ranger. Turns out that the dogs of San Mateo have two options to get off leash. A small terrible bare dirt and rocks park on third Street or Central Park from 6-8 AM. I wouldn't want to be a resident here and own a dog...</review>

<date>1507826030487<//date><text>The Martin Luther King Center Park  is considered a landmark to many of us who are native to San Mateo, California. I learned to play ping pong there, I learned to swim there, I played in the play ground many hours in a days time, I've participated in many events there and most of all the childhood  memories bring nothing but SMILES to my face.
I believe this special place can do the same for many children and adults. So let and allow your children and family members to have the same memories.  It couldn't be a better place!  😄< /text><rating>5</rating><name>Leandra Shepherd< /name>< user>

< review>
Looked this spot up before coming to Pismo for a staycation and glad I did. There's a plethora of spots in downtown Pismo by the pier that...aren't...incredibly...........diverse....in their offerings. Everyone has sides, burgers, boozy beverages, and their own version of clam chowder but Moreno's has incredibly flavorful Mexican fare, GREAT service, and a simple menu that's not trying to be more than what it is supposed to be.
I had a shrimp quesadilla; my wife had a breakfast burrito, and both were devoured within minutes of receiving them.
I needed more and ordered a barbacoa taco and an asada taco...both delicious and washed down with a Jarritos.
Clean joint with great food and friendly service.....what more does anyone need? Definitely returning the next time we are in town.</review>

We were visiting from New Jersey and drove directly there after reading some reviews. WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED! In fact, I don't typically eat Mexican food, and I loved it! What a surprise and what nice people! Everything we ordered was delicious. The staff was so helpful and attentive. We wish we had this restaurant in our neighborhood in Jersey! Loved it!!<//review>

This is one of the best Mexican food restaurants I’ve been to. The owner was very accommodating. There is a dish we asked for that wasn’t in the menu and the staff happily agreed to make our food.I also ordered sopes and they were very delicious and just the right amount of crisp. Really recommend this restaurant!< /Text>

I am a north bay lady and my husband and I realized we should get some tacos since we were south.  These tacos reminded me how special a simple taco can be!  The meat is showcased and Morenos does a fantastic job at their meats.  I will definitely be hitting this place up again before we leave.  It is clearly a true family business.   The momma was so friendly and appreciative of how much we loved their food.  The kind of place you want to support!  If I lived in PB, I know I would be here many times a week!< /Text>

Very good shrimp tacos, cooked perfectly with a bit of spice. The beans were good and the rice had flavor. Alot of Mexican restaurants serve rice but usually bland but this rice had taste. The only negative is the service was a bit slow, but then it was busy, but they were getting some orders mixed up. No big deal but that's why a 4 star rating.< /text>

< Review>
Moreno's taqueria is a new spot in Pismo Beach, but they are not new to the industry and it shows! They were very polite and greeting as we entered and were Covid friendly. We ordered several of their tacos (carnitas, al pastor, chile verde, chicken, and carne asada). They offer a red and green salsa depending on your liking and the tacos are served with a generous amount of lemon. We rode our bikes in from Oceano and brought some 805 cerveza with us as a beach dinner date. We'll definitely be back.</Review>

I have eaten burritos and tacos from all over the United States. However, Moreno's Taqueria  had the best breakfast burrito, burrito, taco, and quesadillas without any real competition. The welcoming nature of this small taqueria is representative of how much care and love they put behind each item they prepare for you.

If the food wasn't enough, the employees make you want to come back on a regular basis. I visited Pismo beach for 1 week, and I made it a point to visit them at least once a day. I loved everything they served me, and the conversations they had with me and my wife. I can't wait to come back!< /Text>

Outstanding Mexican food…my wife is a vegetarian and opted for a bean, rice and cheese burrito…she said she wasn’t really hungry but wolfed the whole thing down!! I had a carnitas combination plate…the carnitas was so good, I ordered 3 more tacos…I was stuffed but it was worth it!! Good prices, REALLY good food!!< /Review>

I never leave a review ever , so let's just start by saying the customer service is better than lots of places I beens , they ask me if I needed anything else , came  to check on our table, made sure the food was right. Just that alone is worth it,but the food was freaking amazing had the barbacoa tacos and they melted in my mouth.

<Text>Manila Wok serves authentic Filipino fast food (turo-turo) with reasonable prices.   They are still open during COVID but only for takeout.
You can choose a combo with 1, 2 or 3 entrees. A 2-entree combo is $8.50 as of the time of this review. Entrees are also available as separate orders or in party sizes. My favorite dishes here include BBQ sticks, pork adobo, lechon kawali, lumpiang shanghai and turon.
My rating reflects the taste and value for its category (fast food).<//Text>< pictures>

I give 4 stars because nothing compares to my family cooking. It gives me the feel as if I’m back home in the Philippines 🇵🇭. Service is okay with me as you might need to be a little patient with the old folks running it. I’m proud that their in business and I hope they continue and grow. The food is decent, not expensive, and will hit the spot if you’re looking for a decent PINOY food spot in the area.<//Text>

<text>I haven’t had sinigang in astonishingly about 10 years. This place did my memory justice, and then some! Sinigang is my favorite Filipino food, aside from lumpia with dipping sauce of course, and this place pleasantly surprised me. I am not local, but had a yearning to get some Filipino food on a whim. This place satiated my appetite, with left over rice of course. Staple, staple. My local Filipino go-to restaurant closed. It’s funny that this restaurant has a very similar ambiance to it, I suppose Filipino culture really shows through decor/service traditions. No doubt this place is family owned, as most of the Filipino shops are I assume. Good people, good atmosphere and most of all GREAT food. Thanks for the hospitality, guys :)<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I like Filipino food. However, the food server was eating when I walked in and did not clean her hands before preparing my plate.  That was somewhat of a turn off! May or may not go back! I'd give them a 2.5.< /Text>

We really liked the Bicol Express and Dinuguan, the Adobo and Pork Sinigang wasn’t bad too. They also do orders same day orders for Pancit (even large orders but check early). Deserts like ube halaya and other rice cakes are sometimes available. Food could be warmer though.<//text>

Manila Wok has good and traditional Filipino food at a decent price. However, restroom facilities are far from the greatest, and the dining area is kept cool from fans rather than air-conditioning. I would recommend the food but not the in store accommodations.</review>

No frills Filipino takeout spot!

Starting with the con: I came in on a Sunday and they claimed they couldn’t take cash, despite the multiple CC stickers on the door (they even have an Apple Pay sticker!) Okay, fine - I drove down the street to an ATM to get cash.

Pros: the food was great, almost as good as my mom’s. The pork sinigang was amazing, broth was perfect and the meat had the perfect amount of fat and was melt in your mouth. My husband liked the BBQ skewers. The tray of lumpia shanghai we ordered for a dinner party was a hit - the best we’ve had since moving to LA probably because unlike other places, it didn’t taste freezer burnt.

Looking forward to trying more of their ulam when I’m feeling homesick.< /review>

<text>I love this spot, pancit is delicious. Good, wholesome filipino food. Fair prices for plenty of food. The menu varies daily, but the choices are always the favorites- adobo, afritada, bisteak, menudo, fried tilapia, caldereta, lechon, etc.. so two item combos are always of a good mix.< /text>< Time>

I was so excited to try this filipino joint since it was the closest to where I live. I was rather disappointed. Food didn't look appealing. Bicol express was lackluster. The only thing I liked was the free broth they gave me. Not coming back here.< /review>

It’s June 8th 2021 and I received a letter in the mail saying a bill of mine went into collections. They said back in October 2020 when I switched units I had a balance due because my deposit did not cover everything. I never received the first letter in October 2020 and I’m in the same apartment complex, I called cannon management and asked them why did I not receive a follow up since I was unresponsive to the letter that I never received and they told me “We don’t do follow ups” & the collection agency they’re working with was extremely rude and the case manager hung up in my face after I asked them to email me the demand letter. They did all of this over $160 I would have gladly paid if I was informed about it. This management is trash. -10/10 would not rent from them again.</review>

<Text>Encanto Apartments- Indio, Ca. If i had the option of ZERO starts i would. the current manager is rude and doesn't care about the tenants. Recently, they enforced the rule of assigned parking for all tenants and no visitor parking. His excuse for having assigned parking was due to a small complaint of residents parking in the front of the complex. Mind you, they've never had assigned parking and distributed parking stickers to each tenants vehicle. A lot of the tenants own multiple vehicles that take up the spaces of  non- covered areas, which is hard to find parking anywhere. Now with assigned parking, management doesn't care and won't take responsibility for calling the tow company to remove the vehicle off property that is parking on someones spot. The manager stated, "You know what to do just call the tow company and they will take care of it." How is the tow company able to verify that the vehicle is in the wrong spot. Why isn't management leaving the office to confirm and call them themselves. I've contacted the Main office at riverside to speak to the general manager Mark S. I have left two messages with no reply back. I know for a fact there is 175 from what the Encanto management claimed of unregistered vehicles that belong to tenants in the on the property. Encanto Management isn't handling this issue properly, and the fact that we were only given a few days notice.  My biggest concern is that Canon Management has yet to return my call, after being told by Encanto to write a letter to have my parking re-assigned to a closer location near my apartment or in my current spot. Even when my neighbors are being assigned the same spot they were parking before. My apartment has been shot up, with a bullet hole to prove it and poor repairs by maintenance. I never made a big deal about the bad repair that is still disgusting to see every day as a reminder of almost being killed when the bullet traveled through the kitchen and in to the bathroom where i was sitting and stopping in the bathtub.

My complain is that the current Management at Encanto, is that they do not care about the tenants or what effects they have when making rules without thinking of the issues it will cause between neighbors. Also the fact that I can't choose where i can park at near my apartment.

attached are the pictures of the bullet holes.</Text><Response>{'time': 1568071682072, 'text': "Hello Jose,\n\nWe're sorry to hear about the inconvenience the newly\u200b assigned parking policy has caused you.

<Date>1623087643247< /Date><review>I joined Cannon Management as a leasing agent with a little over 1 year ore of property management experience in the industry. I  am reaching my 5 year anniversary with
Cannon.
My company has given me a promising career in property management with endless possibilities for growth. The support and training I am given has empowered me to promote to an Assistant Manager on a beautiful lease up community in Temecula.

My Regional Leayh has so many strengths and talents. The strength I admire the most In her is her true professionalism and her passion for the success of the community’s and  for her teams.
I highly recommend Cannon to those looking for a strong company.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

Lived at The Landing in S.B., the  manager Irma Gonzalez is the most unprofessional, unintelligent staff there. Used to live there & went to pick up some mail & she said “yeah i don’t know maybe one of the other apartment has it”, even after THEIR staff told me to come pick it up because they had it in hand. Don’t have someone be so called “manager” in the office & not do their job properly or effectively. Giving my mail to another apartment is fraud, especially when it contains personal information. She didn’t even try to resolve the problem, on top of that had the assistant manager getting loud & acting childish, as if she didn’t have any common sense? Worst management ever!</Review>

< review>
These are pictures of a "move in ready" apartment the day AFTER my scheduled move in date at a cannon management property called Lido. They didn't respond to my calls on the date of move in, closed early and still did not have it suitable the day after (men with powertools still working... not to mention the apartment was on the wrong floor). This cost me thousands of dollars in moving, transport, relocating, storage, housing, etc.... and i didn't even sign the lease yet! This is a blessing in disguise because if I had to deal with these people over anything they should be responsible for I can imagine it being 50 folds worse. I can only sympathize with the actual tenants who have signed leases with this terrible company. They use dishonesty, deception and childish arguments to support their behavior. Ultimately one of their "corporate" staff Markeith Smith told me to sue his own company in what I believe was an emotional breakdown on his part. The sheer lack of unprofessionalism and disrespect for people from this company should be considered criminal. I now have to spend more of my time (above what cannon management has already wasted) to take this plague of a company to court and honestly it's worth every second and dime out my pocket. Slumlords like this will continue to behave like this, treat general public and tenants like garbage until they are forced to change. Thank you Markeith Smith of Cannon Management for your sage advice to sue your own company this is unprecedented.<//review>

Crystal the new apartment manager for my building is rude, over talks you, and has a very smart mouth. When you call to ask questions she doesn’t give you a straight answer and instead she catches an attitude and behaves in an unprofessional manner. Also, when I call for maintenance no one calls back for days and when she calls back she has a very nasty attitude. I’ve never had any problem in the past with any leasing manager but this lady is very unprofessional and brings an uncalled for attitude to the table. Maybe she doesn’t want her job.</review>

<text>Beware of Rebecca. I’ve had two experiences with her now where she has shamed me for making complaints. A true bully and nasty person. I was cussed out in my elevator by a neighbor while with my daughter, and Rebecca was unhelpful, rude, and condescending about my report. I recently advocated for the pool to reopen, which is now legally supported by LA County Health Department, and she again spoke over me and demanded “this conversation is over.” I can’t believe this woman is employed by a property management company. Her lack of support and respect for tenants is uncanny. As someone who has unfortunately dealt with her on multiple occasions, I advise a new career path for Rebecca.<//text>< pics>

Please, do not affiliate, do business, or partner with this company. Many "managers" wouldn't know how to operate a lemonade stand, let alone a rental property. They condone irresponsible, unprofessional, and flat out poor customer service. They only care about your money.<//Review>

<text>This is what they call remedying the issue. I have personally pulled rats out of my attic. I have had an on going tat problem for over a year. Cannon bought out the last company 3 months ago and I had yet to see anyone until today. (Because I got a lawyer). They know where the issue is coming from but because it’s not owned by them they will not remedy the issue. I have attached pictures. I mostly have videos or the rats chewing and squeaking in the walls. I have lost sleep over this because they just won’t shut up. Cannon management hasn’t made this any easier for me.< /text>< pictures>

Have my water shut-off,s home during repair, and construction, strangers possibly contaminating my personal space which I paid for. I returned home on 72020 and there was a large hole in my celing hazardous waste Rusty nails scattered all around my living space. at this point I left the keys in the room contacted them that I'm never returning and requested my security deposit as well as the rest of my money for the month that I already for.

Cannon is absolutely abhorrent. They will ignore your requests for service, hire unprofessional and rude employees, and at the end they will demand you pay for the turning of the apartment. I have rented multiple times and cannon was the only company that DEMANDED I pay for paint, carpet cleanings, unit cleaning, and service fees. I left the place cleaner than when I moved in. They were not even in charge of the complex when I moved in, and they tried to tell me I left I dirtier than when I moved in. Scam artists. Once I showed them the California civil code regarding what they were asking me to pay for, the magically disappeared. They still send me letters threading to report me to the credit bureau if I don’t pay for the turning of the unit (paint, carpet cleaning, unit cleaning, maintenance, etc). They can expect a law suit if they report me. Wish I could give them and their ignorant staff 0 stars</Review>

<text>Terrible experience with hoa bill. We didn’t get checks for hoa payment and was told that it’s more comfortable to pay online. So now my payment didn’t go trough and I should pay fee 20$. They just send me a letter about that after one month since I made it. And I wasn’t notified that my payment didn’t go trough. Very nice policy to collect money from your costumers.< /text>< rating>

<review>Town Square lancaster Ca
The very last encounter with Stacy was fine til I went to shake hands with her. She pulled away. I asked her “ you’re just going to leave it like that? She says, “yes because I didn’t like your review of me”
This to me is very childish since the last time I spoke with her was when I received a 60 day notice to vacate with no reason given.
She obviously holds a grudge with tenants even two whole Months later.
I’m mystified as to how your company continues to allow their on site staff to operate  without reciprocity for their poor behavior.
Honestly in any customer service industry. Staff are usually required to act above board, not allowing personal feelings to govern their response to consumers. Regardless of a tenants behavior she should have behaved accordingly.
I am concerned that she will ignore my request to retain my new address to have my remaining deposit sent to me.
Maurice ( the senior maintenance person ) made the final walk through with me. He noted how very clean it was and minimal impact to the unit despite four years occupancy. We also discussed how the carpet was damaged due to numerous maintenance errors, three separate floodings due to plumbing issues and adjacent tenants misdeeds. Despite all the maintenance records that reflect all those issues beyond my control. I feel she will try to place all the blame on me with personal malice.
The fact remains I’m not the only tenant who has had this problem with her. If this were my business, I would not allow an employee to harass, grieve and lord over a tenant his/her position of authority with a personal grudge. This is harassment in its purist form.</review>< pictures>

DO NOT RENT AN APARTMENT BY CANNON MANAGEMENT!!

They are more concerned about money then there residents. It is coming up on a year of living at there Park Heights property. When I signed my lease they told me its $735 monthly and I do not have to pay utilities. Then, when I went to the office to pay my first month rent they told me I should of received a water, trash and sewer bill in the mail. I did not receive the bill till my second month of living there by Con Service which are also, money hungry people. I was looking over my bill I was charged for 3 people even though I only had 2 people living in the house hold. I went to the office they told me there is nothing they can do. I called Con service spoke to 2 managers and 5 representatives, FINALLY, after 9 months!! I was billed correctly!! Mind you every time I go to the office they are closed stating come back 2 hours or they are rude and do want to assist you at all.When I moved into the apartment the front door was broken, I had spiders and roaches. I notified the office I was put on the list to be sprays they never came!!! I put my 30 days they told me I have to pay to get the door fix, paint the walls and pay 100 for someone to clean the apartment. My deposit is only $300, I can clean my apartment for FREE!!!
I WILL NEVER RENT A CANNON MANAGEMENT PROPERTY EVER AGAIN!!
OH!!!  and they raised my rent to $877 from $735 and the month to month is $1178!!!< /Review>

<text>This is a Re-rating of the MOUNTAIN VIEW COTTAGES APTS. In Indio Ca. I would like to say after my last review I made on July 4th regarding the parking situation, thinking the problem would not be resolved I am so glad I was wrong. While waiting an hour for a parking space after 12am on that day I had time to leave a message to my manager Brenda "who's been a manager since I've moved in over 5yrs ago" and an Awesome one at that, plus leaving a message to the owner Sam of CANNON MANAGEMENT CO. I would double my 5 Star to 10 Star if I could. THE OWNER SAM WHILE ON HIS VACATION heard my message got things done THAT DAY on an holiday. I feel that Cannon Management Team and my manager and staff will get this parking situation resolved. I truly have to point out on those 1 Star ratings it is NOT Cannon Management Co. It's the MANAGERS of the property doing wrong. The Cannon Management Team sees these 1 Star comments and tries their best to make it right for the tenants, I'm so glad that my manager and her staff is the best of all the places I've lived in including back east. All I can say is Cannon Management Co. Rely and trust on their managers of the property to do what's right for their tenants. I have to say I am VERY VERY PLEASED that the situation I was in is now being resolved and it won't be just a couple of weeks it's going to be PERMANENT. So I'm hoping those 1 Star reviews managers of the property sees my review and do what's right cause Cannon Management Team will investigate as long as the tenants emails or calls the owners so they know what's going on things will get done. I would love say THANK YOU Cannon Management Co. and my manager Brenda and staff trying to make Mountain View Cottages Apts. a great place to live in.

River Oaks - Riverside,Ca. HORRRRRIBLE management since the day we moved in. Moved us into a roach infested unit while I was pregnant. Had to move our stuff from that unit to another. They turned the roach infested unit into a model because it was so bad. Nic was working in the office when I went in to apply and he wanted us to keep quiet of the roach situation because, little did I know at the time, he was manager of cannon management, and didn’t want investors to back away. Cannon management took over within the month. Nic promised us lower rent in upgraded unit for the year, once he left the office personnel said it wasn’t possible. It has been THE WORST rental experience I have ever had. They tried to say we didn’t pay our rent had to go thru hell to get a receipt to them and then all of a sudden they found it in the safe. Roaches and mice. Service repairs don’t get done. They won’t fix anything else in our apartment because we put in a 30 day notice. The gym was closed most of our time there, manager argued with me for the time it had closed and machine was broken saying it wasn’t...what’s the point???? Random water shut offs every week, literally. I can go on and on but I’m tired of typing for now.</Review>

Let me first start off saying that this Property Management (Cannon Management) does not care about families who are good paying tenants whom been living in their apt for years. Also, if you have kids or plan on having kids, then definitely BE AWARE and don’t move into any of their properties. Me, My husband and 18Month Old son are now HOMELESS because of them.

We lived at our place at TOWN SQUARE APTS for almost 6 years and around OCT. 2018 our Apt got infested with BED BUGS. Never before did we have a Bed Bug problem. They tried to say we have to pay $1600 for treatment when we finally told Management after realizing they weren’t going anywhere.

We’ve been Month-to-month ever since our first original lease was up in 2014. Supposedly they revised/changed some terms and conditions from our original lease once Cannon took over. Well GUESS WHAT?? My husband and I never got any addendum or amendment. Stating the changes.  We never re-signed a lease or anything since our very first one which we still have.

Cannon Managements new LEASE has in there that TENANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PEST (BED BUG)COSTS and whatever. Well when we told Management that we shouldn’t have to pay $1600 for something we didn’t bring and we’re not responsible for the costs. They hit us with a 3-day notice saying we violated pg8 of the lease . Well our original lease that we are held to goes to pg 6. So we aren’t responsible for anything.

To top it off, we confronted Management about the 3-day notice and how are they holding us to a violation that we have no recollection of or have not agreed to. Also, my husband questioned the amount of $1600 which they said was for treatment. The lady in the office named Mira said  thats not the actual amount but a proposal. So right there they’re frauds and crooks trying to steal and lie about pricing and stuff. I also asked for information regarding if there has been other tenants affected with bed bugs because by law they’re supposed to disclose that information to other tenants and treat it. Later, I ended up finding out a lot of OTHER UNITS are infected with BED BUGS and I have the proof from my old neighbors. Well, eventually after all our questions and mentioning why we never got anything to sign when changes were made to the lease.The main office lady STACEY HOLLYFIELD, which is a horrible manager btw said that we’re insulting them and that she’s going to give us a 60-Day notice. Legally she can’t do that just because we asked questions. There was no other basis.

So we ended up getting the 60-Day notice but ended moving out before then because they had the nerves to do treatment a month later( Probably cause the PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT VIOLATION), but failed to realize its an INFESTATION. All three of us were still getting bit horribly. We didn’t want to get bit anymore or risk paying a full month of rent since 60days was up in the middle of the month. So we moved out!

Anyways long story short, they added the $1600 to our move out cost and are saying we owe them $600+. Seriously we don’t owe them anything, THEY OWE US our Deposit! Having to be bit up, get no sleep, physically, mentally scared for 7+ months and then rooted up/kicked out of our residence with our 18Month old son is no joke and they’re still trying to make things worst for us??! CANNON MANAGEMENT IS THE WORST...STAY AWAY!</review>

<Text>Cannon took over my apartment complex in Anaheim about 4-5 months ago and it has been a complete nightmare. They fired all of the competent staff and replaced them with their own who clearly do not understand property management. Forget about getting any maintenance done and also forget about having a clean rental history- the staff will "lose" your rent payments and incorrectly serve you a 3 day notice. Only if you can provide any and all receipts do they magically "find" your payments.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Currently transitioning under this new company and I could not be more nervous. They come in and cut all of our employees pay and remove all our bonuses. They give us our offers on a damn note pad to take home, no official documentation on anything. My major concern is if they already cut pay of the employees I can't imagine what will they do next with our residents. I don't expect they will be doing any renovations or  events now that this company is already off to a great start on budget cuts.< /Review>

<review>I firmly believe they rented my daughter an apt that was filled with toxic mold and covered it up with paint at Lido, the management staff is unprofessional, had to call code enforcement who stated the mold was there and coming from under the foundation.  The management gave nothing but attitude, had to call corporate to get some assistance.  When we left the apartment was molded to the point where code enforcement stated it was inhabitable for any future residents.  Stay away from Lido...that's only the basic, there's more.< /review><user_id>115977632812265414198< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

The Lindy West Apartmenr First of all I pay $1325 to be living an apartment infested with cockroaches. Bought ALL brand new furniture and spent thousands of dollars. I wish I never moved here and the management is the worst. My license plates were stolen while being parked in the carport and then my keys were stolen, then my car broken into stole everything in my glove compartment. This is NOT a safe community to live in. I felt safer in Long Beach than in this ghetto apartment community. The gates are never even locked. They give you gate keys that don't even work. The heater doesn't work. The water is milky and has calcium. I have sent several emails to the assistant manager and manager regarding all my issues and they are still not resolved.<//text>

This is a company that puts profit and everything else above tenant satisfaction, period. Currently I am dealing with a problem with maintenance  and management regarding workers smoking in the rental unit below me as they prepare it to be rented, but they must not have noticed the no smoking sigh posted next to the apartment door. Their music has been blasting for the last two days despite my several requests to management to have it stopped. The noise of work being done is expected but blasting music and the revirberation from it is maddening! I spoke with Claudia directly on the second day and explained I was trying to test online but was too distracted, her response was to offer me the show apartment to do my test...i asked if she could ask the workers below to turn off the music and she defended them by saying,"they are just trying to have a little fun while working". I pointed out that I was a paying tenant and that they were paid staff.
Really should I have had to done this and so far their music is still going, loud!</review>

<Review>I have to take them to court. I moved out in January, now it is May, they refuse to return my deposit & the management onsite stopped communicating. The only letter they did send was to the apartment I moved out of with no deposit back. See you in court & I will make sure to spread the word NEVER to rent in a complex owned or managed by these guys! Terrible shame! Reporting to BBB & everywhere else I can think of. For what, my $535 deposit? Really?!<//Review><Name>Julie Pedersen</Name>< pics>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Cannon took over my apartment complex a while back .. it's been nothing but problems since then. I've had my rent lost, they've towed my car from my parking stall, they lost my lease from the previous management company and then told my I couldn't renew it. I was served a three day notice for having boxes on my patio, although I'm moving and have no where to store my stuff. When I moved into my complex the rent was $645, it is now $900 + and this is for a 1 bedroom in San Bernardino. The managers in my office never answer the phone or return calls, the phone just rings off the hook.. I call cannon and they do the same thing. Worse management company I've ever came across.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>I have lived at Lido for over a year and the maintenance was slow at first, but they have always come to fix things and they do it properly, unlike some places I have lived at before. I have had no issues with any rent increases. Some of the properties they manage are not the cleanest, but hey if you are looking in the ghetto for an apartment what do you expect? I see the workers picking up trash daily every morning and to be honest, they could do it all day because of the trashy tenants here. San Bernardino is not the best place, so whoever complains, move to a better area. I have lived at one of their Upland places and it was fine. The staff here at Lido are friendly and if you pay on time then there's no issues.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>The manager in Vista View Apartments located in Rialto, Ca. (Jezebel Salazar) is horrible and very incompetent with her job. Idk how you can hire someone as a property manager with no college education background. I guess she got lucky because her mom brought her in of how great her “daughter really is”. She seems to be very uneducated.. the fact that she’s the property manager.. you would think she knows how to do her job well. She’s illiterate when it comes to writing notices to tenants. It makes you wonder what does she mean other fees when the only fee there is in the notices are latefees. I have never heard of a Refrigerator Fee in my whole life for being along term renter. (?)  She’s never in the office and always takes long hours of lunch and breaks.  She’s always gone and never answers the office when we tried to get a hold of her. She takes the advantage of being a property manager. She towes tenants vehicles just simply to scam tenants because she knows the person who does the towing and she also get half of that money. It happens there all the time until someone had made a complaint against her to the corporate office regarding that issue. She was put on leave for investigation. Also on Thursday’s she’s not available but theirs someone there in the office to help.. but only to leave us with a respond to comeback.. when a property manager is there during “her business hours”.  But what’s the point of having someone there on every Thursdays? when in fact they can’t even be helpful to our needs? People move in and move out due to car thefts, garage being broken in, infested with cockroaches and very inhabitable due to poor cleanliness of outside of the property example like the dumbster overfelling trash everywhere where raccoons eating trash at late nights and bums comes every morning in the property to dig in the dumpsters in hoping to find any recyclable items such as cans, glass bottles and plastics. This property in Rialto has to be the most unsafe apartment complex I have ever lived in. They don’t do anything about the cockroaches, but yet they’re so worried about the grass being cut, which I don’t understand when tenants lives inside the units not the outside. They’re worried about the outside more than the inside and the most important issue.. they should be able to address is the inside unit where tenants lives with there children and families.. where we all eat and sleep that’s more important of all. I believe she’s not fit for this job and cannot successfully deliver her job well. This property is very disorganized and very inhabitable. Business hours is not Monday to Friday. It’s when she’s there at the office whenever she wants. She takes more breaks more than anything that we have ever seen. You’ll see tenants or people waiting outside the office when she’s there.. like as if they’re waiting for food at the restaurant to order. She can never be reached at nor she returns your call. The only time you will ever find her in the office.. is when the rent is due the first of the month. Other than that good luck, maybe now because new regional general manager has again changed.  But keep trying. The worst property manager.. I have ever had to dealt with in my whole life.. very incompetent in my experience. The management ( Cannon) as well are very easy people to get manipulated by their own property managers. It seems like they really don’t give a damn about you as tenant and would rather just hear their own workers side of their story. I thought by hearing both sides of stories would clarify some misunderstandings. I guess you can’t even go to the chain of command.. it’s just pointless and useless to talk to these people. Let me clarify this I have live on this property for 5 years and the experience I’ve had to deal with is what pretty much what I described a living hell.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb08b57cff299:0x6953ff0fc8f3b27d</gmap_id></record>

Its a rip off, we basically give pay $135 monthly for them to nit pick about yard violations instead of truly providing services that add value to the community.   Just a another example of the establishment digging into the little guys pocket to scape every last penny. I think the government, Better Business Bureau should look into these unfair HOA practices.</Text>< Pics>

<text>This review only pertains to Jonathan Gilbert and my experience with him as I toured available units. I was helping a particular obsessive friend in finding an adequate loft in Downtown Los Angeles. My friend need to know square footages, rental amounts per square foot, noise level and sun exposure, how noise insulated each unit was, room dimensions, intended purposes for the rooms as displayed, and a whole host of other details I've since forgotten. In the midst of this we had to go and add more coins to the meter which meant some of those details had to be recalculated and regurgitated for my friend. Did I mention going to visit the two units of interest three (3) different times? Can you say 2 hours? During this entire time Jonathan was gracious and professional, never sharing any sign of fatigue, even though we had kept him working past his shift. For making my mitzvah bearable, I think he deserves 5 stars.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcb08b57cff299:0x6953ff0fc8f3b27d<//GmapID></record>

They do dealings with shady companies too. Their vendors for towing and security specifically are terrible companies and I even recall looking them up on the BBB to find that they had F ratings.

I lived in the Cannon Management owned Temecula Creek Villa Apartments for a total of 13 months, and while the move in process was easy, the apartments themselves are well laid out, and the rent is affordable- They're clearly out to make their money in deposits.

Upon move out we were sent an invoice for $1,129.05 and this includes a $65 credit for overpaying our rent! I called Cannon Management and was referred to Mike Vandaele, who oversees Temecula Creek Villas.

He was so incredibly rude, it was mind blowing.

When I told him there was a $500 pet deposit unaccounted for he told me that it was on me to prove that it had been paid- no offer to look in to it or anything. And no surprise, but also no apology after I provided the proof.

When I asked for receipts of the renovations paid for- the painting, the steam cleaning, etc. He told me they were not required to provide them (which they are).

When I explained that per California civil code 1950.5   "A landlord cannot routinely charge each tenant for cleaning carpets, drapes, walls, or windows in order to prepare the rental unit for the next tenancy."  and also, Brown, Warner and Portman, The California Landlord’s Law Book, Vol. I: Rights & Responsibilities determined that minor marks or nicks in the walls are the landlord's responsibility as they fall under "general wear and tear". He blew me off and refused to discuss the charges. I believe his exact words were "We're done here".

He's been rude, uncooperative, and unwilling to explain or provide proof for any of the charges.

Here's what they charged for-

$144.70 (Prorated) for "Paint Touch Ups"
$135 to clean the unit
$83.13 (prorated) to steam clean the tile
$831.79 (prorated) to replace the carpet

Replacing the carpet I'm fine with- we got a puppy, I get it- but then charging us a $135 cleaning charge WHICH INCLUDES VACUUMING THE CARPETS is ridiculous. On top of that they also charged $83 to "steam clean the tile" when "mop floors" is also included in that $135 cleaning fee. When I pointed this out, Mr. Vandaele offered a $5 credit "because that's about all it's worth".

After reading all the other reviews and similar stories from other former tenants- I will never consider renting from a Cannon Management owned property ever again, and I will be sure to suggest the same to my friends and family.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Everything that Shy said in her previous review is true.  The property was sold and is now managed by Canon property management.  They came in, fired Shy and Abert and brought in their own people.  If you're a current resident you need to pay attention and speak up because things are only going to get worse!
If you are a perspective resident run for your life, save yourself!

One of the main issues at this property is SECURITY,  there is none!!!! Many of my neighbors have had things stolen out of their patios, furniture, bicycles, plants, shoes etc.  Skate boarders who do not live on the property use it  as their personal skate park.  The underground parking is completely vulnerable to theives.  I can't tell you how many residents have had their cars vandalized.  One resident came down one morning to find her car jacked up and ALL OF HER 4 BRAND NEW TIRES STOLEN!  As far as SAFETY goes, it is just a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt.  I have had run ins with shifty, dirty looking characters who look like they are under the influence and ask me for money.  This has happened ON the properrty! The vistor parking on the Center St. entrance is used by passers-by who sit in their cars, smoke pot, drink and then leave their garbage for someone else to pick up.

As Shy said, MAINTENANCE is a very sad situation. Although Chris and Efrain are still here they are spread thin on such a large properrty.  Meanwhile the property is in disrepair; the doors leading from the parking garage to the apartments are filthy!  The plumbing above the cars in the parking garage leaks constantly.  It is obvious that they are trying to cut corners because they contract with the lowest bid contractor, the  "keystone" cops of repair guys.
Rosie the property manager for many years has moved on.  I'm sure she will have no problem finding another property to manage she is a gem!! We miss her terribly!  Finally,  our rent used to go up $10 every year but this last year it went up $100!!! Because we have a year lease, we hope things will improve but if not we will be moving on.
It's really a shame that it's all about the bottomline and not providing good service.

Again, if you are looking for an apartment and drive by wondering if you should check out this property just keep going.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>This management company took over The Regent in Palm Desert with the new owner.  They are the company that is cold, combative, and evil. They fired all the staff that was there for years that we all built relationships with.

My neighbor just came down with cancer and had 2 months left on the lease after 10 years of living there with no issues. Too sick to work and needed to move in with family. He gave the corporate office a doctor's letter stating he can't work for quite awhile and that he needed to break his lease early and not. Be liable and they said tough luck.

These people are disgusting.<//Review>< Pictures>

I was delighted to be here.  We went on long hikes, driving tours,  and tons of group activities.   The contractors are really nice and the whole experience was well organized and worth it.  Bring the kids and the wife on this one!  They will love it!  This is all from what I remember…..I get headaches sometimes.</text>

I went 10 times total! I even got to contribute to the beautiful artwork within the medical aid station. Both as support and to go into the luxurious rustic camping experience. All of the comments about the accommodations and amenities are true! This really is the most wonderful vacation spot to spend time with all your best friends! PS. I've seen the majestic desert tortoise a total of 5 times and consider myself deeply blessed. Stay safe, brace for rollovers, and remember! The dust blowing in from the campgrounds is full of the poop particles of everyone before you-- take a deep breath and inhale history!</Text>

<Text>Absolute blast to stay at for vacation with friends. We all went here and had the best time ever for our little California getaway. I can only rate 4 stars however because the sleeping arrangements were not as advertised. I didn’t end up with my silk bed sheets and fluffy pillows. Other than that, I’d highly recommend to anyone looking to visit for a month getaway under the desert stars</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>Absolutely close to nature.  Should be a National Park.  Why fight the crowds and the copious numbers of Griswald families when you can come here AND get paid?  Bring a tent, it gets windy.  While sleeping on the hood of a HMMWV, you can go star gazing!

Sleep is optional.  Why be wasteful with 7-8 hours of sleep when you can perform 2x the work with 2x less sleep?  Quadruple productivity!

The Starbucks at Barasu wasn't bad, but they were out of a lot of stuff.

The tours felt a bit rushed.  We'd take a tour in one spot, enjoy the views and then someone yelled "We're jumping the TOC" and all of a sudden, we all had to leave or something.< /review>< Response>

The bathrooms with no stalls, the delicious meals, the staff that will go to the end of the world to make sure to get you everything you need. No need to worry about the heat because the Army provides AC in the box! The sleeping arrangements are very proper, clean sheets and you will not have to worry about some critter crawling on you when you’re sleeping. I cannot forget to mention the vehicles. They are all so maintained and up-to-date. What I love the most about coming here every year is that they say we’re only going to stay for a few weeks, but we always end up staying for about a month! I would rather be here, and one day I’ll send my children here to enjoy the time I had. Cheers!<//review><userid>101168689348066960350</userid></record>

Beautiful scenery and world class food. Enjoy a delicious California burrito, soak up the sun, and take time to reflect on the poor choices you’ve made in life before your brigade gets annihilated by 11th ACR.< /text>

<review>If you come prepared, NTC isn't so bad. Wash and dry your clothes before going into the box. And ration them so you don't run out of clean clothes. Get yourself a good hygiene kit. Don't waste your cash on the gut truck: they don't guard the chow pad during the day, so there's tons of free food you can just snatch.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM02zIia9VCaFSck30GcWVtvBjLFPrtW_q8w92u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2AWSi4Aj6aEF439yyMxh-E0sZy71DUnsKBuif=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyap3gB8c2mwRHmmNi4a609pA5I6OiZolbujzf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJnaPlSb62BFtd2OV3eQdSsyC0fbItwEw-ubXZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoe14889lqLbl67o6KMiVPMXf6vOc-oIiZf068=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFcTtWMk6_7cjcGjTb29i_hyjRUw9AvZnV_VSy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj74Jl37t-becAvhSzxTGupB6yzymCg6bmyOur=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Sunny, spacious, and exciting! Unforgettable experiences and good friends are abound on the RUBA. Friendly staff, never a dull moment, and best of all the food. Six different restaurants to choose from with new choices every night, make sure you get there early because seating is first come first serve! A dynamic and fully expense paid trip to heaven. There's hiking, running, privacy, all on a secure compound. Ask your bg staff when your next rotation in heaven is in the training calendars!!<//text>

<text>I can't find the correct words to describe this gem of a vacation destination resort nestled in the California desert.... The living conditions we're if I could put 6 stars I would just magnificent!!! The breath taking scenery....literally from the sand in your throat and lungs...was superb!! Don't get me started on the top notch dining very up scale stand up  dining very trend setting.....The long safari trips through the desert with the Ac unit not working in the safari vehicles... but who needs ac when it's a cool 117 degrees... I could go on and on about this fabulous vacation destination but you'll have to book yourself a month vacation package through your unit or your local Army recruiting center... they'll hook you right up with a all expenses paid trip here at some point!!! Don't thank me ...thank your recruiter for this piece of heaven on earth when you go!!!!</text>< Pics>

Should I start with the power constantly going out, or the fact that you have to wear full kit with ppe in 115 degrees. I think I actually want to start with the toilets that have no door so you can happily greet others as they walk by. My over all experience at this 5 star vacation away from home was life changing at the least!!!</review>< time>

There are a large variety of dining opportunities, although wait times can be long for the most popular places. Spacious accommodations are located within walking distance of the dining areas, and are only a short distance from the entertainment options that are set up in the clearing just to the south. Endless hours of entertainment await you there at both the beginning and end of your trip.
Overall- highly recommend for those looking for a little extra thrill in their lives and for those who want to get out there and see the world.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c438e5f3a22f97:0x21a2f859d551567b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Resort had many amenities unavailable, unlike the travel brochure had mentioned. House keeping was lacking, the " five star cuisine" was more like -5 star. Had a blast though on the many activities that were guided by super friendly staff, to include some sleep deprivation, nvg driving, and pooping in a plastic bag. Would most likely not return again, but probably will. Oh yeah, bring quarters for laundry machine, the app requires a $10 minimum.</text>

Taking life for granted? Feeling spoiled? Well, you’re in luck. The RUBA is design to cure that. There are a few places on this planet that can make appreciate the little things in life. Like good toilet paper, privacy,... etc a few days here and you’ll be cured....<//text>

If you’re reading this you’ve likely already booked your all expenses paid vacation to one of the hottest resorts in southern California. This exclusive retreat will not disappoint. It truly is a desert oasis. After a day of countless activities there is no better place to unwind. At the touch of a button let the spacious showers massage you with hot water which never runs out. Then relax in your spacious, high ceiling air conditioned bungalow. It is an experience like no other! Would recommend!!</Text>< user>

What a wonderful getaway. Whenever me and 700 of my closest friends just want to escape from it all and disconnect from the world this is our go to spot. Gorgeous vistas, exotic tortoises, rustic living quarters, the RUBA really is the full package. Don't forget to check out the quaint local towns of Barstow and Victorville! They're full of interesting places and wonderful people.< /review>

Where do I even begin? This is a must visit location that everyone should stay at least once in their lifetime!

The Ruba offers airy, elegant rooms where you’ll find marble bathrooms with soaking tubs, smart TVs, and the most luxurious beds you’ve slept on. You will not be disappointed!

Dining options include plush international restaurants, cafes and a buffet eatery with the finest foods on the west coast.

I would rate the Ruba 10 stars if they would allow me to! My friends and I will definitely be back in the future. See ya next time California!< /Review>

Surrounded by some of the most scenic terrain you'll ever have the displeasure of spending a whole month around. It has the look and feel of being at one of the biggest beaches you'll ever find in your life, with absolutely no water. If you do so happen to get tired of the free food supplied to you and your party, feel free to spend an unnecessary amount of money at one of the many food trucks available to help you gain all that weight you lost back immediately.</review>

I don't know what it is about this place that keeps me coming back.  Might be the fine dining experience, the comfort of outdoor living, the spacious room for activities, or the ability to lose a third of your body weight in ten days.  If you truly want to understand how the "rustic" Americans live, ask for the "WAG bag". They never run out of supply.  If you see the desert tortoise, please take a picture, and add it to this location.  More people need to see the beauty of this tropical oasis.  Oh, I'll be back.  Can't get enough of this place!<//Review>

<Review>the best place I have ever been, its even better than the great place I have lived, the food is free but you have to stand up, the hotel rooms where nice as well but they were a little cramped and for some reason I could not get to a wall outlet. after a week in this resort you get to go take a 2 week long nature hike in the beautiful desert that surrounds the area. my only problem with that is that our heaters kept running out of fuel at night for some reason and we kept getting attacked by people who threw very loud firecrackers at us and tear gas. I don't know why they were so angry at us the place is huge they could have found their own camping spot. but is was a very stress free time.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Are you having too much fun in life? Are your spirits full of joy and happiness? Well come on down to the Ruba, Box, and Rufma get away trip! This 4 week all expenses paid trip will take you through the motor pool, pooping in little bags to help conserve the environment, wearing body armor in ridiculous heat to protect you from artillery shrapnel. Then once you get out of the box you love the little things like toilets, running water, and AC. But wait theres more! Then you get to sit two days in line to turn in a truck at the RUFMA! just to be told that there was a bolt missing in the fender so you gotta get that fixed. Highly recommended.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Although we did not stay on The RUBA, we were just a short 2 mile walk away over the mountain at Bicycle Lake. The name is a little deceiving with the complete absence of water or bicycles, but the heat waves coming off of the ground made it easy to imagine a luscious oasis. The RUBA is a traveler’s delight with long walks, few trees to block the view, and a plethora of restaurants to satisfy your every craving. However, if you do not want to be shackled by the pampered accommodations of RUBA, I would highly recommend the quick trip to Bicycle Lake. Get back to your pioneer roots with no showers or indoor plumbing. You also receive The RUBA’s all inclusive guided tour through “The Box”, a utopia of mountains and wildlife with friendly locals. I will definitely come back for years to come.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Every time I'm in the area I just have to stop by this hidden jem. The staff is very friendly and service is great. The menu has a wide selection but the I highly recommend trying the  Ratatouille mixed vegetables with penne vegetarian. Scenic and colorful views all around and plenty to do for a whole months vacation. It's even home to the world renown desert tortoise! A++++++++< /review>< pics>

<Review>The 12th wonder of this world! While others fret between the choice of a zoo, a beach, or an all-inclusive resort- the RUBA takes out all of the guesswork! Daily safaris through an exotic climate allow for all types of animal sightseeing; be sure to bring hay for the donkeys! Dennis the Donkey Mascot is available 25/7 to answer all of your precious questions. Escape to the water buffalo side, with plenty of sand for everyone! Kick off your shoes and allow the heat to melt away all of your stress (and some skin). Finally, enjoy a plethora of fine dine choices from one of the 5 mess pads, along with in-season food trucks! Your trip awaits you! 12/10</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I have to say I definitely concur with everyone else. The RUBA is a fantastic getaway when you're trying to leave the life of modern conveniences behind you. The beauty of nature can be seen when someone throws trash on the ground and it is instantly picked up by a flock of crows. As you walk around on the "soft" sand you can listen to the crows quietly chirping in the background.

If shopping is your game, head on down to the Base Supply Center where everything is conveniently priced and never out of stock. Don't forget to grab some free popcorn on your way out, the slushy machine is broken.

Finally, if you enjoy fine dining and fanciful delicacies, head on down to the strip where you can enjoy such fine establishments as Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Subway.

I am sure to visit again! CANNOT WAIT!</review>

This fine resort is located in beautiful southern California where you can soak up enough sun to burn your skin and sand to enter every crevice of anything you own (even that place, don't like you don't know). Ruba resort come equipped with "Alcatraz" style showers (drop your soap and shower is over), great stand in dinning experience with limited walking space, best of all the toilet rooms come equipped with shower curtains that are already falling apart and as bonus you're lucky if half your body doesn't stick out. The sleeping accommodations are great if you like company (up to 144 persons per room). So if you're near the Barstow area and looking for a life get away, this is the place to be.< /review>

This is definitely one of my favorite vacation hotspots. The facilities are accommodating in the temperate and breathtaking landscape. The ruba offers a wide variety of foods that can satisfy any pallet. Feeling adventurous? Be sure to try the exhilarating hike through the motorpool, taking in all the sights, sounds, and fresh air of the beautiful scenery. Much like other 5 star resorts, it can get a little bit crowded during the tourist season. Be sure to reserve your spot as soon as you can!<//Text>

<Text>Nestled in a cozy corner of this quaint little desert community you will find this hidden gem.  Spacious living areas and unique bath house style bathing  creates an upper class feel matched only by lavish Dubai living.  Take a midnight stroll through the "Goodyear filtered" sands of the automotive garden on your way to your very own observation tower. There you will spend what's seems like a lifetime enjoying the views of the surrounding rolling convoy dust clouds filling the sky.  Lazer tag anyone? This place has a multitude of outdoor activities. Mtn hiking, cave exploring,  many dry lakebeds that you can look at but never touch and let's not forget tortoise dodging!  Love this place? You should check out another hotspot just down the road. Book your trip to Yermo  CA and never miss the exciting action of the US railroad service!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNuE16eD3G2N8s4jKv_Mw9Fc4AsOmftYxeD6ig=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Rate>

<text>Arrived on one of the fanciest charter buses with all the bells and whistles after a relaxing 15 hour bus ride. As I stepped off of the bus at 0430 in the morning into a cool 100 degrees, I could tell this was going to be paradise. As I settled into my cottage, which was insulated with tan flex seal and boasted a comforting open floor plan, I took in the full aroma of axe spray and scrotum. Exploring the resort brought many adventures. One of my favorite things to do was wait in line to get a basket pass to the shoppette. By the time i made it to the register to pay for my 69 cent slushy, it was already devoured, but the customer service was second to none, so i never minded paying for an empty cup. The basket nazis were also friendly. It didn't matter how tired I was, I always had plenty of energy to enjoy the scenery at connex yard. My favorite part of the safari, called the box, was putting on mopp gear, as the desert nights in August can drop to a chilly 98 degrees. I also enjoyed socializing with the local populace and did not mind the risk of contracting notional congo fever. Our tour guides, the OCs, we're very friendly and offered constructive criticism such as "you are the worst group ever". If you were lucky enough to step away from the ruba resort, which was frowned upon, you might have had the opportunity to enjoy other sites such as wild donkeys crapping in the family park or perhaps catch a glimpse of the $50,000 tortoise. If you were willing to chance an article 15 to work off your 8 dollar burrito and walk to the gym, which is not open to rotational units, you would have a fitness experience only comparable to 5 star hotels...so I've been told. My only criticism was that, while having a bowel movement, the 13 pieces of old tape stuck to the shower curtain door did not allow for the breathtaking open view of the clogged urine troughs I was hoping for. It just wasn't the same feeling as taking a dump out in the open desert with no cover in front of the luring eyes of our tour guides into a plastic bag, then carrying said bag back through a group of your friends, putting it in a clear trash bag, because smelling it cooking in the heat all day did not stimulate the senses enough. There's always next year.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c438e5f3a22f97:0x21a2f859d551567b</Gmap_id>< user_name>

At first I thought the accommodations at the RUBA were going to be crappy tin buildings, boy was I wrong. They really turned up their game on the tin roof, concrete floor 5 million man barracks buy using spray foam for walls. It's much softer than metal and just as hot when the air conditioning constantly breaks.

I particularly enjoyed urinating in troughs that were level so that when you flushed them the water just diluted it and not drain. This in turn created a wonderful aroma of dead animals and death. The glorious stench was only enhanced by the toilets which were backed up most of the days with turds the size of forest trees and monuments of wet wipes waving to you from above the water line.

But everything cannot be perfect which is why I'm only giving the RUBA four stars and not five. I was not impressed by the medical care at all. When you show up each morning and night you only get to see a PA, I mean they're not even doctors. When they ONLY gave me a shot of toradol, muscle relaxers and other NSAIDS for my back pain, for the 20th time, I immediately asked for an MRI which was denied. Knowing better than the PA's my wife deduced (researched WebMD) that I needed surgery for my chronic low back pain. My debilitating pain is mainly exacerbated any time my team leader asks me to work. My wife also told me to try lavender oil. I did what she said, because I have no spine or thoughts of my own, and it not only helped my anxiety from being yelled at by NCO's but decreased by body odor caused by Sun constantly beating down upon my lowbrow which causes me to perspire. I think they should hire my wife to work there, she can search google as good as any PA.

All in all if you like extremely overpriced & poor quality food trucks, hour long lines in the 100+ degree weather, and lots of smelly people having coitus in the Porta Potty and containers at night, then you've found your paradise. If that's not your thing, which I cannot understand, you just might be normal.</text>

Luxuy lodging, exquisite eating, exotic flora & fauna, breathtaking views, amazing night time views of the sky... what's not to love. I remember the feel of Saran Wrap peeling apart from my thighs as the package I had stowed between my legs shifted in my rush to be the last off the 5 star bus. I squinted my eyes to the blinding beauty that is he RUBA, licked my lips, and could swear I tasted the local layer of powdered/confectioners dust settling on my now moistened but cracked lips. A hint of dried urine was suspected as the filler ingredient. The hardships brought me closer to my brethren as the cosy Quarters allowed us to exchange the scents of musk de toilette, and second hand or partially deoxygenated air. I did however appreciate the morning greeting of bumping elbows with strangers while trying to shower. Such good mannered folks. Some toilet stalls were occupied by my fellows, or the occasional Turd who weighs an average of 12.5 Courics (to big to fight with and takes too long to evacuate the stall). Some of the locals looked suspiciously like giant crows and I am sure their size is attributed to the leftovers that our resort donates to them. Deeeeelish', by the way. Mystery meats, preserved fresh fruits, compacted eggs, sugar flavored with fruit juices.... ohhhh I can't do this to myself right now!!! You can even pet the occasional rats whose features resemble that of Mr Splinter. I remember the night sky, dust brown and slightly reminiscent of a cool sand blaster. Just gorgeous. 5/5 would recommend that you do not miss the chance to come here. Overall the accommodations were out of this world.< /Text>

Agree with the above review. The rent is free here! I couldn't believe it. Although the bathrooms are actually located outside of the living space, it's worth the short (or long) walk, depending on where they place you. A lot of trash is always blowing around, but that's OK because there are constantly roaming groups of people volunteering to pick it all up! My entire face has peeled off three times while here, but man you should see my tan. There is local shopping and eateries on wheels that charge a substantial fee for their meals, but it is somewhat better than the free food that is offered at the standing-room only establishments spread across Ruba. Don't venture too far off Ruba without your proper safety gear or you will be confronted and yelled at by random strangers. After one week, you get to go on a special trip and camp out under the stars in the Mojave desert for two whole weeks. Sadly they didn't tell us there would be no shower facilities while we were out there. They told us we couldn't take phones, but I swear I heard people talking in the porta-potties out there. This is my second time visiting and I have to say, this place gets better with every visit.<//Text>

A little slice of heaven in the California desert, the RUBA truly is an oasis for those travelers seeking tranquility and senic bliss.  Let the perfectly manicured and lush green grass flooring of the rooms massage your tired feet at the end of a long day as the melodic beats of helicopter rotor blades lull you into an unbelievably peaceful slumber. Travelers will enjoy this "blast from the past" with rocky brown sandy terrain that stretches for miles and puts you back in time with your ancestors from long ago.

The cuisine is phenomenal with a myriad of options day or night.  No need for room service when the food trucks are constantly on patrol for hungry guests, spreading their infectious Home Depot day worker charm to all those who choose to partake.  Looking for dessert?  The shoppette is conveniently located just a minutes walk from any one of the bungalows.  In the mood for something sweeter? What could be sweeter than the shaved ice truck that appears randomly to deliver fresh snow cones... and, of course, smiles.

The feeling of isolation gives way after a few short days to make way for true zen.  Travelers will find themselves completely in harmony with the natural landscape, covered in the dust of self satisfaction, helping you further connect to your surroundings.  You will never find yourself bored as the daily tasks are plentiful and, and while completely meaningless and mundane, always ensure you are greeted by that feeling of accomplishment as you lay down to rest and stare up at the stars.

Will definetly stay here in the future.  A total steal for those traveling on a budget.  An absolute gem!< /text>

Really good food and very authentic. We had the lemon chicken and it so flavorful. We also had the salad and the drinks they make. Can’t wait to go back and try other stuff on the menu. The service was awesome and they so informative about the culture and history of the Indigenous people in Vietnam.<//Text>

It’s just so incredible how flavors can be so different based off of how a region combines spices or even adjusts technique a little bit! I’ve had plenty of Southeast Asian including Vietnamese in my life and have lived in Asia for a few years but the flavor of the dish I got here was so innovative and refreshing! It kind of reset my taste buds, so to speak! Very patient staff despite all my questions! Fresh and delicious. What’s not to love?!</Review>

Halal Vietnamese food?!?! Why yes please. Not being of the religion, I wanted to at least try it to discover differences and how good it is. Well, after discovering this gem more than. A year ago, I've been consistently coming here. I enjoy the glass noodle with lamb the most here. I cannot say they are better than others I've tried. It is a tad different than traditional but in making it Halal, it didn't take away from the deliciousness.< /Text>

You have to try the lamb chops and spicy beef pho! Food tastes really good and fresh, I like their taro drink too. The restaurant is clean, the service was excellent, and the food was tasty 👍😊< /text>

I received a call their number about something related to my social security number. While I haven't had the food, and I imagine it's fine enough, they shouldn't engage in scams or other less than savory practices using their business's number if they want to seem legitimate.<//text>

This is a family owned spot with amazing food. I lived in various parts of South East Asia for 5 years and this really took me back. The banh mi is excellent and the Champa chicken is truly unique. Will definitely be back to explore more of the menu</review>

Probably the best bahn mi sandwich I’ve ever had! The food here is excellent and made with a lot of love from the owners. If you’re looking for distinct regional flavor, champa is an experience. The sandwich is not dry unlike other bahn mi sandwiches. The meat is very juicy, gives a fresh taste and the bread tastes very fresh too. The brisket quality from the Pho is also very great and really enjoyed the broth quality. This is a place to go more than once. A wonderful halal establishment. I highly recommend their sandwiches and any of their soups.< /text>

<review>Finally!!!!
Halal Vietnamese food and it is awesome.
We called them 30mins before closing, if we can still come, very politely they told us to come.
People there were very humble, as a it was my first time in a Vietnamese restaurant, they explained me the items in their menu.
We ordered Champa chicken, Bo and Bun Bo.

This was the best chicken I ever had, I loved it. It's kinda crispy chicken  cooked with lemongrass.

Both the soups were tasty and the beef was perfect cooked.
I liked Bo more then Bun Bo.
Bun Bo had  something like chunks of fat in it that I didn't like that much.
Bo was the best!!!!
I will highly recommend this place and I will visit this again.</review>< pictures>

< review>
We just had another awesome meal from Champa Kitchen ❤️ I can say it is my favorite  place to order pho from. They never disappoint us. Our must have-s are beef sandwich( ask it without jalapeño if you are not spyci eater), beef pho. I also love their papaya salad, which is also very spicy,  I have never asked them to reduce the spiciness, but I guess they can do it mild too.
The owners are very friendly and good people. I hope their business thrives and grows.</review>

<Text>Food was great. We went for dinner. And ordered Chicken Pho, Chicken Fried Rice, Paratta for appetizer.

The Paratta was the best I have had compared to make other places. It was finger licking tasty. We love pho and dont get Halal anywhere. This place had it and was just super good.

Would recommend this place for sure. Family owned, very friendly. They have a praying spot as well, if you are there on prayer time.

Very neatly maintained. Kid friendly. Plenty of parking as well.< /Text>< userid>

Nice place for family. It is clean and neat.
The food is amazing. The portion is quite big for us, big enough for 2 kids to eat. The new menu, fried egg noodles is very good. And the chai tea is a must have.
The staffs are very friendly and good with kids.
It's always been a great experience to go here.< /review>

Not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. Though the people/cook are from Vietnam, some of the dishes have Malay and Thai flavors. The Champa people have their own, food, language and culture while living in Vietnam. I've traveled through Southeast Asia and can appreciate the flavors they have brought to the area.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This restaurant has a unique offer which is halal Vietnamese cuisine prepared by a minority Muslims community in Vietnam called Champa. The menu is small but they use the best fresh ingredients and execution of each dish is authentic. I have lived in south east Asia 25 years and I can say with certainty they prepare dishes with authentic recipe. The staff are extremely polite and well mannered. The dishes to must try is the beef stew with french baguette, very uniquely vietnamese. I learned of this dish when Anthony Bourdain visited vietnam in his show. A French vietnamese fusion dish. I have been to about six different vietnamese restaurant in bay area and 5 in Canada never seen this beef stew on the menu.  The mango salad is fresh, herbatious, sour, slightly spicy, nutty and sweet all same time. I have tried the chicken pho which is very subtle but good quality organic chicken. I most of the times eat the spicy beef pho and I always ask for extra spicy chilly paste or sate. Truly unique experience is also their curry which is unique to their region. To me it's very similar to Thai muslim or malay style coconut curry type broth. If you like malay style or even Burmese Muslim style curry you will like the Champa curry. I have tried their fried wings simple, good quality fresh chicken and simple seasoning of salty, sour and sweet glaze typical of South East Asia cuisine balance of these flavors together.  I have visited this restaurant five times with a gap of one month each time. Every time they delivered the end product with the same excellent quality. This is a relatively new restaurant one year or so. I wish them lots of success in the future. I hope others come to this wonderful restaurant to experience the unique cuisine of champa. We need more places like Champa that bring unique cuisine from minority community all across the globe. A must place to try.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Grand opening last month, my first time there on a quiet Tuesday afternoon.   Small intimate room, clean and bright, with friendly prompt service.  Enjoyed the Chicken Vermicelli Bowl (bún gà), served boneless and skinless, with fish sauce on the side. Chicken pieces cut just right, very tender, interesting spices, just the way I like it.  Good quality fresh ingredients.  Probably the only Halal Vietnamese restaurant in the Bay Area (so no pork).  Bún also available with grilled beef slices or grilled shrimp.  Curry and lamb dishes also available (have not tried yet).  Vietnamese Iced Coffee also very good, fresh tasting, served pre-mixed in the glass, so no waiting, but it was a bit expensive.<//text>

<Review>I adore this place! They give decent food, they have a rich menu, The chief cook in that place is an expert, I enjoy a lot trying all their dishes. The dishes are always of high qualtity, the service towards the visitors  is nice. I visit often this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it to all my friends.< /Review>< Pictures>

My daughters first job she worked at this exact Mr. Yous and she was a good worker the women who works there also known as may was very rude to my daughter she would come home and tell me about how she would be mistreated  by the owner. My daughter says the way they had her clean and serve food was outrageous  . She would serve her customers and may would reach into her plate and take food out  I do not recommend this place to work at or eat out very poor costumer service and treatment<//review>

<Text>Hands down this is the best Chinese food place I've ever eaten at. Always my first choice when choosing a place to go. Ive gone to this place for 5 years now. Their food is so delicious! Big portions for very reasonable prices. I recommend the sesame chicken, it's one of my favorites! The wontons are great as well, although everything is. Try it for yourself (:</Text>< pictures>

Because their food sent my mother to the hospital and has been their for the last 8 days. Not only is she their still, me and my two other sisters got the same food born virus  and when I called to get information from them all they can say is "I don't know". I'm glad the hospital informed the health department hopefully before someone else gets this as well.< /review>

<text>I read the poor reviews, and as mentioned in some of the reviews this place is a walk in counter service, NOT a restaurant!!
The plaza had a power outrage at the time and no one else was open. We were staying in the hotel across the street and looking for a place to eat. Though, with no electricity, Mr U was open -  cash only,  cooking with gas.
I thought the food was GREAT, we ordered the 2 item plate and there was enough for two adults, the noodles, orange chicken, & teriyaki chicken was just plain GOOD. I would go again</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

The Place use 2 Be Very Nice when they First Open, & the Food was Nice, BUT now that they have been there for some Year's, it's NOT the same, The Place is not CLEAN like it use 2 be, The PRICE has went UP & they don't even GIVE u the Same amont, So U get my dliff, Higher Price & Less Food . What kind of Business is that, But that's how it is at Mr.You, & that's the TRUTH<//review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>This Mr You is the worst. Prices have been increased and the serving amount is less. All prices on the menu are covered with tape. Sorry to say but their employees are greedy with the food, after serving a spoonfull they take some back. Its outrageous how its gotten more expensive and they want to serve less. I surly will not buy from them anymore. Mr. You in Moreno Valley here I come.< /review>< date>

<Text>Went here after long day on a Sunday with friends. We bought the tickets online which was great and checked in in the front desk. We then got some food like popcorn and nachos which were okay. I had my hot water around to stay hydrated. We watch kong vs godzilla which was good. Then we got dinner afterwards at a nearby place.</Text>< username>

I finally got to go when they were showing Vertigo.It's a beautiful venue, and I thought it was so cool that there was an organ player before the movie.And for such a historic theatre, and for being in a popular neighborhood, the ticket prices are reasonable.  I didn't buy anything at the concession stand, but my roommates did and they said it was expensive.  Better to eat beforehand.</Review>< pics>

Loved going here, wish it was still open but we have to do our part. I still enjoy the whole process of going for a movie. And you could get food and drinks at your seat.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Wow Wow Wow!!!  You have to go see a movie here!!!!  Absolutely gorgeous theatre remodeled art deco, a throwback to yesteryear and a fun place to hangout.  You can order your dinner, drinks at the Alameda Cinema Grill, they'll deliver right to your chair.   Get there a little early, eat your dinner, sip a glass of Cabernet, watch a great movie, so much fun.  Take in the amazing architecture and the inspiring detail that makes this historic treasure so worth visiting.  The Alameda Theatre is an Art Deco movie theatre built in 1932, designed by renowned architect Timothy L. Pflueger and was the last grand movie palace built in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Highly recommend!</Review>< pictures>

<review>Unfortunately we didn't get to see the movie showing at this theater, it was sold out.  However we did enjoy the wonderful Art Deco interior architecture.  This is like a flashback in time, it's very beautiful.   The light fixtures, paint colors and details are so nice for pictures.   We only talked with two staff members and both were nice.<//review>< Pics>

I really enjoyed my visit to this theater.  I usually only go for Warriors watch parties ($5).  The theater is so clean and the employees are friendly.  The environment is peaceful until people like me become rowdy during the game.  I have a lot of fun with the other WARRIORS fans.  We give Hi-5s and cheer "Waaaaaariars, Waaaaaariars" and "DEFENSE, DEFENSE!" You can even have food delivered from the restaurant next door to your seat if you are sitting in the reserved section and delivered to the theater door if sitting in the general section.  I can watch the game at home but I really like the large screen and the people.  It is the next best thing to being at the Coliseum.  I will definitely will go back to the Alameda Theater for other games and movies on a discount day.<//Text>

<text>We adore this local theatre.  What a gem!!!  The historic theatre is lovingly restored, and the small theaters all have great sound.  Have made some really nice memories there- especially on holidays when we book reserved seats and bring the family.  Only bummer is the food from the restaurant is a seriously overpriced for what it is (especially since the portions seem much smaller- ie the pizza).<//text>< Time>

This is my go to movie theater.  Always make first choice.  The staff is very friendly and keeps the theatres clean and comfortable.  They have beer and food available in the theatre, so you can grab a bite while you watch.  Parking is easy in the adjacent parking structure.  There are loads of restaurants in the area as well.  A great place for a date or a family night out.< /review>

<time>1583920312403<//time><rating>5</rating><review>One of the best based on types of shows offered and food choices.  Traditional theater seating, but good quality and comfy.

I tried ordering from my seat, (not during the movie, of course). It took forever to figure out the website and there's a minimum order amount for delivery (why?) so I couldn't just order the calamari. I added the chicken sliders which turned out to be a good thing since they were great and the calamari sucked. Plus, I had to enter my home address for "delivery" so I wasn't sure if I was ever even going to get my food or if someone was driving it all the way across Oakland.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f86be0f8c89dd:0x7b58c36ce6683445< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Their tickets are quite cheap for the bay area ($9 matinee tickets) and they have great deals at their adjoining Cinema Grill. Their restaurant will even serve you right at your theater seat!!! It truly is a fantastic theater.< /Text>< Pics>

One of those theatres that is a hidden gem. So much history in the building itself and even during renovation (new carpeting), they still have many ways of accommodating their guests. Very nice place to take the family and enjoy a nice outing.<//Text>

<review>Theater was great, two story historical building. The seats were old school but still comfortable.  The food was terrible (from both the concession stand and grill) save your duckets and just enjoy the movie.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>The most amazing, clean, well run, and friendly theater I have ever encountered after 46 years of life, residence in 5 states from NC, IA, TX, & NM before here!

Simply a delight. In fact, we look for movies to come out there, just for an excuse to go check it out, and convince ourselves it wasn't a dream!</Text>< response>

Such a beautiful theater. Only four star because the older section of the theater has older seating and not as comfortable as the most modern theaters. That's being picky though as the theater is really a time capsule that captures a magical time of a bygone era.< /Text>

< Review>
I love this theater. Not only is the theater a nice theater, both well run and with multiple big screens, but it is in a great location. Part of the reason I like coming to the Alameda Theater is to go to see a movie and then go to one of the many good restaurants around. I would highly recommend this theater purely based off location. Still, don't discount the fact that the theater itself is pretty good too.</Review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Lovely theater with beautifully restored art deco interior. Seating is comfy. Staff are typically friendly and helpful. The selection isn't huge (I think they have maybe 7 or 8 theaters, not super sure), but it usually has the current blockbusters and enough of a variety to suit my movie mood. There have only been a few occasions when I really wanted to see a specific movie that I couldn't find here. This remains my default theater and I really enjoy coming here.

I love that they do special series throughout the year. They had a classic movies series going on Wednesday nights for a few weeks for example, and I hope they keep the series events going. They also used to do a special talent show or trivia thing before movies in the big historic theater on popular nights, but I'm not sure if that is still happening.

It seems they will be slowly moving toward more sustainable practices, like reusable dishes similar to a restaurant rather than the disposable cups and packages typically found in the concessions, and I appreciate these future changes.

I've enjoyed this theater for years and will keep coming back regularly.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>I love this theater.  Amazingly restored to its original splendor.   It really makes going to the movies feel like a night on the town.   I really like the added ability to order food from the restaurant next door and have it delivered.  Yes,  you can eat it in the theater.   They even have reserve seating if you want it delivered.   Just know the reserved seats for the restaurant delivery is right up front where you walk- in. Me and my husband like to sit in the very back so you can sit anywhere after you get your food.    Which is what we did because we are not comfortable sitting that close to the screen.   That's a lot about that service.  We tried it,  we liked it.  It is on the pricey side,  but we expect to pay a little more when we come to this theater.  We don't even live in Alameda anymore, and the are two theaters closer.  That's how much we like it.  It's all about the ambiance.< /text>< pics>

<review>So much history here and such a beautiful theater. The food options are superb and the ushers take friendliness and courtesy to a whole new level. On big opening weekends it can be crowded but they do a very great job in keeping things clean and organized and I greatly appreciate them.

I liked the first time I visited this cinema, I was well received as usual in any cinema, but the last two times I went, it seems that all the staff had a bad day and that is what they reflected in the face and their bad attitude.  I do not go to that place again, management should take action on the matter since literally from the person who charges the ticket, the person who is in the snack, and those who review your ticket were with a bad attitude each and every one  of them even I asked a lady that she was angry?  or why she attended with that bad attitude I simply received from her a negative displacement.  I have no problem, I am a tourist and I do not return, problem for the locals who are the people who pay their salary.</text>

< Review>
A gem of Alameda, this movie theater is a community center for Alameda and shows a wide variety of movies appropriate for both kids and adults. There's a good restaurant called the Cinema Grill next-door which will serve you food in the theater if you want to have a meal and it's also a great place to go for drinks or dessert after a movie. Alameda Theatre is a beautifully restored Art Deco movie palace that's fun just to be in let alone watch a movie in. The city paid to restore it and they were smart enough to also pay for parking garage that's right around the corner so it's easy to park on most evenings.< /Review>

This is a uniquely lovely place, and I can't think of another example like this.

It's a regular movie theater, plus good people and better organization and faster-moving lines, plus a damn fine pub that delivers food to you in your theater seat. Try to beat that.<//Text>

Then I went bowling for just $7 at the Alameda Bowling Alley.

Our family really enjoys this theater - great sound, lots of snacks to choose from including beer and wine. We tried out ordering from Cinema Grill and although it's a little confusing to navigate online, the option of having dinner with your movie (and cocktails!) is great.< /Review>

First time patron to this theater and any theater in years. I enjoyed the movie even though I wanted to see a different movie at another theater but enjoyed it nonetheless. Will most likely be back< /Text>

Great place to see a movie! Nice, art deco interior that brings back some of the excitement of going to the cinema. Also really nice to be able to order real food at the adjacent restaurant and eat in theatre. You can even order beer and wine!</Review>

A great theater, particularly the main screen. In addition to wide release movies, they do a lot of classic movies and community events. Concessions stand prices are about the same as any other theater, not unreasonable, and they have beer. In addition, the restaurant next door has a program where you can order from your seat and they will bring it to you. Parking's not bad, there's a parking structure just around the corner. I live in Oakland, but I will make a trip to see movies here whenever I can.</Text>

small, cozy theater in Alameda! one of our gems :) The staff are always the sweetest and have the best service. I love the $5.50 Tuesday deals, I like to go every Tuesday to check out movies until I've watched all the ones I wanted to! Plus sometimes there are special month offers where they offer free/even cheaper screenings! In the summers for example they hold kid friendly screenings of different movies throughout the month and it's such a great place to bring your family for a nice outing! plus they have a parking structure adjacent so you never have to worry about finding parking. it's also close to park street where all the eateries are! a cute local date spot if anything :)</Text>

Alameda theatre is a full service entertainment destination.  There is a big multistory parking lot on the corner.  You can reserve a seat for just a dollar more.  And there is a connected restaurant so you can get food and drinks delivered to your seat.  But the best part is the historic main auditorium is HUGE and it has incredible sound and projection.<//Text>

The best east bay movie experience.
Not the new super theater plush power recliner type but a mix of old fashion with modern movie experience.  Add to that the food selection from the Alameda Grille and sit back and enjoy.  The only draw back is other than getting your ticket from the Grille, there is no assigned seating.<//Review>

Alameda theater is a great place to go. Take your family or go by yourself or friends. It's always a good experience, the historical theater room is so beautiful! it's so big very comfortable, just a pleasant place to come and watch a movie. The popcorn is always fresh, they have a restaurant where you can order food in the theater and they will bring it to you, it's very nice, it's family-friendly, it's just fun! Everybody's so pleasant and sweet and kind I've never had an issue ever and I've been going there for quite a few years.
Tonight there was a issue with the sound, they stopped the movie and said they would refund your money if you wanted to leave right then, or you can watch the rest of the movie and get two tickets to return to the theatre.
My grandson and I decided to stay and watch the movie.Very nice, enjoyable, so yeah if you want a place to come where it's comfortable and nice come to Alameda theater you will not be disappointed< /Text>

This is our favorite movie theater in the area. It's a beautiful building with theaters playing first run movies, clean restrooms,  great customer service and you can get good food and drinks delivered to you if you want. What's not to love?< /review>

This is my home away from home. If you're feeling  peckish, pass by the bar/restaurant and buy your tickets from them. They will bring your food orders to your seat.< /review>

I love this Cinema, mostly due to its close proximity to my apartment. The workers are very friendly, the concession stand is more than decent, the bathrooms are clean (can't truly enjoy a place, if the bathroom is crappy), the seats are plentiful and comfortable, and the screens are extremely high definition. If you live, work, and/or visit the Alameda area and have free time that you are willing to spend on watching a movie, I can't recommend this Cinema highly enough!!!< /Review>

Family owned theater restored beautifully. Love coming here for the summer movie series and $5.50 Tuesdays. Reserved seating with the ability to order food and drinks right from your seat make this great theater even better.</Review>

Great historical movie spot!! They have one of the best sound systems same as all the big name theaters have. The one thing that sets this place apart is that they kept the old charm and feel of a historical theater.<//Text>

I loved stopping at the Alameda Grill for movie size pizza and an awesome organic Rose wine. We bought our tickets and breezed through the Back Stage entrance. Ant-man and the Wasp was fantastic in the historic theater. It was a great movie night!< /Text>

Not your amc, or other big theater. Gives you an old school vibe. Very clean and nice seating. Staff is very polite. They seem to always have only a few people on deck working but it has never been crazy when we've gone as a family.<//Review>

I feel all the memories of my young childhood where I spent every Saturday going to the Twelve (noon)  kids .all day 50 cent Saturday Matinees (.25 cents if you cut out the discount coupon in the Alameda Times Star Newspaper.  The theater is just as close as it can be..even the phone booths and wayer fountain still decorate the main entry room. The majestic ceilings and fancy powder rooms wall to wall mirrors, the red crush velveted carpeting that makes you feel your among royals.. I am so happy its been restored. The love is obvious and my total respect to the owner. Thanks Kyle.</text>< Pictures>

<review>This is a alright theater. The movie area is nice and modernize to the current era. The movie staff needs work. I say this because this theater runs thier own restaurant right next to it. You can have food and alcohol beverages serve to you inside the rooms before the movie starts. Which is an unique feature offer here at this place. The rooms could smell bad depending on the clean up crew and time. I had twice smell sewage odor and mildew. It made me sick for a week.   I mainly go here for the Tuesday movie special pricing.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1549080611773<//Time><review>I live out of the area and tried to buy tickets over the phone as a gift for loved ones who live in Alameda.  I've done it before, in fact this time I had communicated via email and was told to just call in.  I called 3 times on separate days, each time speaking to the same person who said he too busy to help me.  When I was finally able to get his attention he said that I couldn't buy what I wanted but changed his mind when I explained the emails however I had become discouraged by his rude attitude and decided to take my business elsewhere.  There's so many other options out there why do business where it's not welcomed.<//review>< GmapID>

AND the Cinema Grill had fantastic food -- and when you order food from there (either to eat before or during the movie, you get reserved seats at the theater. Best kept secret in the Bay Area< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Having grown up in the town of Alameda this theater was not an actual theater it was a tumbling gym for kids. the movie theater was actually at South Shore Shopping Center but years later very recently they have renovated it and brought back that excitement of going to the movies and working with local businesses to promote new releases and bring back that small-town feel of going to the movies with your family and friends and then enjoying dinner and drinks ice cream Etc before or after.< /Review>

Great restored theater.  Comfortable seats.  You can order food and drinks at the attached restaurant. The snack bar sells beer and wine.  On weekend evenings, the main theater has entertainment before the movie like Alameda's Got Talent or movie trivia.</text>

This historic theater and attach Cineplex is filled with rich history in Alameda. The main theater was built in 1932 and was active for about 50 years before closing down. It was restored and reopened in 2008 with the attached Cineplex. It was in the Guinness Book of World Records for the brightest projector. I'm not sure if it's still there or not. Highly recommended location to view a movie.<//Text>

<Text>This was my first visit to this theater. Went with my wife and daughter to watch a kid movie. The place was huge and nice but the screen image wasn't always clear (out of focus) and the screen had a spot in the middle with something wrong. Don't know if it was dirty or what, but my eyes were focusing on it while I was trying to watch the movie.<//Text>< Rate>

Good mix of new technology and Old time feel, exactly want i want in a movie theater experience. peaked in the historical theater and it is breath taking, curious how the experience is on the balcony. Great pricing and appears to have a restaurant and reserved seats, will definitely be coming back for more.</review><Date>1471039947770<//Date>< user_name>

The small theaters aren't bad and I wish the upstairs concessions were open, but that's not enough for a deduction and the main theater adds value. A local cosplay artist sets up some really cool scenes for some of the new releases in the lobby. You can rent the mezzanine for events, too. This place has some great vibes.

If your feature is in the main auditorium, then you're in for a treat. It's a huge screen, great sound, comfy seats, and some extra entertainment on Friday and Saturday (Alameda's Got Talent). During the NBA Finals, they telecast the Warriors games for a really fun watch parties. There's a mezzanine that I've yet to use, but that's on my list of things to do.

As for concessions, this is where I really like this theater. First, they've teamed up with the neighboring restaurant. You can get a special front row seat and they'll deliver your food to you in the theater! They also have pizza, beer, and wine. And for my kiddo, they have a $5 combo with popcorn, a small soda, and a fun sized pack of M&Ms.</text><UserId.>110618131638463984111<//UserId.><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<review>Love this theatre! Especially on Tuesday’s when they offer 1/2 off ticket prices!

This theatre has so much history and you can feel it when you immediately walk inside.

Parking: You have to park on the streets or in the parking lot across the streets. You will have to pay if you arrive before 6pm.

Prices: I think this tickets is reasonably priced, even not on Tuesdays. You don’t pay $15 like you do at other theaters!

Would I go back? Absolutely!</review>< Pics>

Old school movie theater charm that still has a small town feel to it. Such a nice respite from the cookie-cutter megaplexes that took over the industry. I hope this place stays open forever!< /Text>

A good movie house with 1 large historic theater and many smaller cineplex style theaters that show all the latest films. The theater had fallen into disrepair, but was purchased by a city/private partnership and restored to its former glory. Comfy seats. Good consessions. Decent matinee pricing.< /Review>

Great location, readily available parking in the garage too. The concessions aren't terribly priced and the historic theatre is great.

The movies are of limited selection, but it comes with the territory of a smaller theater<//Review>

Downside: Food isn't worth the price, IMO. Beer and wine big bucks also.. $8 a pint/glass. Lower the price and you'll have a total winner.<//text>< GmapID>

An unbelievably wonderful theatre in Alameda, with fantastic image and sound. Be sure to schedule a Fri. or Sat. night show in the main theatre for an incredible pre-show of singing, dancing, jokes, magic, and whatever else they plan!</Review>

<Text>First time at the Alameda Theatre and it was awesome, watched The Post in the main Theatre. Great pic Awesome Sound! A section of seats is open to sit in where ordering food and beverages available including Beer on tap. Live before movie entertainment including a trio on the drums guitar and flute performed songs that were popular during the same time as when the movie took place. As well as a magician performed a few goofy tricks including audience participation with snack prizes for those lucky wieners and to top it off all performers threw child size m&m packs to the entire audience as the movie previews began. Definitely a must go if you haven't had the privilege yet and I cant wait until the next time I go.
!!!Awesome Experience!!!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808f86be0f8c89dd:0x7b58c36ce6683445<//gmap_id>< name>

Large old movie theater that was renovated with large screens. The sound was perfect. This complex offers pre ordered dinners delivered to your seats. Lots of covered parking around the corner at 75 cents per hour. Large snack bar.</review>

Theatre #1 has the ornate decorations on it's walls and the original movie house, the other theatres were all added on later.  One of the movies we watched I noticed were slightly blurry and out of focus at the beginning as the titles were just less than tack sharp.  Only the staff cleaning the auditorium could I find to mention about the focus.  Stadium seating was comfortable, sound was good without being overly loud.  The washroom is stepping back in time.  The slightly off focus visual was it's weak spot.< /Review>

Great theater not owned by a big chain. Their historic theater is designed like a vintage theater with a stage in front of the screen. They okay current movies & have begun to upgrade their concessions so you can now by pizza, wraps, beer & wine along with your standard stuff. My only knock against them would be that you can't buy tickets online through Fandango. You can through the their site, but it's just gives you a slip that you have to get scanned at the box office or one of their kiosks to print your tickets.<//review>

<Review>The main theater is huge and wonderful to watch movies on.  The seats are great, recline, and people are generally quiet and nice.  The other theaters though smaller and still quite large and it is great to watch movies on.  And the sound is excellent.  Overall one of the best theaters in the bay area.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

<Review>Clean, small town cineplex still featuring a classic big screen theatre as an attraction. Very friendly staff and management keep this complex humming . Additional features are the restaurant attached as well the multitiered parking garage .
It lacks an extra star as the younger staff can sometimes be a bit uneven hospitality wise .<//Review>< Pictures>

It's a fine theatre that has the historical theater on one side with a modern multiplex on the other side. Sound and picture were fine but nothing special. You can order alcohol at the concession but requires a separate line from the food. As far as I can tell there is only public parking available.< /Text>

Amazing community movie theater designed with a nod to the glamorous 1930s and 40s Art Deco, with state of the art picture and sound in the main theater and attached modern complex. All sorts of local charm and Tuesday matinees.< /review>

My favorite theater in the East Bay. Try to catch a movie in the main theater, art deco beautifully restored. Great neighborhood to go for a stroll before or after the show, and parking is free after 5pm and on the weekend in the parking garage around the corner.<//review>

I always choose to see movies at this theater if I can. It is absolutely beautiful inside as it was painstakingly renovated from Deco-era glory. The prices are reasonable, and the snack bar staff is helpful and fast. Check their schedules for classic movie nights, as well as a kid's movie series during the summer.</text>

<text>Before they closed the ORIGINAL Alameda theatre, it was a classic beauty inside, last movie I saw there was Deliverance. ....it closed the same year, I believe, could never look like that again. I can also compare it to the time I was just 7 or 8 yrs old, so pretty. ....now, with the elevators......NAH...good sound and chairs much more comfortable. ..<//text><gmap_id>0x808f86be0f8c89dd:0x7b58c36ce6683445< /gmap_id>< Rate>

Who doesn't love alameda theater? Parking around the corner, nice people,  and never really busy on weekdays or matinees. Love the cheap prices once a week - and that you can order food from one of the first rows and have it delivered to you during the show!<//text>

Great local theater. Supports the community, live streams sporting and other events. Lots of screens but the theater is laid out very well so they're all good size. Reserved seating with food is available.< /Text>

This is a restored old school, multi-screen theater that has a really nice vibe and excellent service. The seats are comfortable and it was a very good viewing and listening experience. I'm definitely going back.<//Text>

Main theater is large and a good mix of traditional and modern.  Decent ticket prices and audience members are respectful to each other. Favorite place to watch movies.</review>

<Text>I always have an awesome time here. Plus you can order food and have it brought to you in the theater. It has a nice retro look but everything is still brand new. The people are friendly and the environment is easy going.< /Text><rate>5< /rate>< response>

Modern, comfortable seats and theaters, convenient parking structure nearby, pretty easy to drive to.  Oh, and staff who are actually real, interactive, friendly people and not half-dead automatons.  One of the most pleasant movie-going experiences in the East Bay.< /review>

<text>Love this place for it's convenience, old school decor, and location.  Love their discounted Tuesdays. They periodically have displays for action movies done by an independent artist and they are fantastic. For those times you need a beer with a a bad movie you can also get one on tap from the concession counter.  Reservation system and synergy with the neighboring Alameda Cinema Grill is over rated.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This is our first time at the Alameda Theater. Clichés like “hidden treasure” are seldom deserved. But in this case it certainly is ... and more.
We came all the way from Western Marin.
Our experience was unequaled in any other  Bay Area theater. We will come many times again.</Text>

<review>Fun.  Very comfortable seats, you can reserve a seat with a meal.  Overpriced snacks as always so the meal with movie thing is great. Huge movie displays in a beautiful lobby of a classic theater.  See movies here!!!  Not super crowded, very friendly staff, some young and annoyed...  Free water with a glass at the fountain.  Nice neighborhood for a meal and movie then Ice Cream.<//review>< Pics>

This is probably one of the best theaters in the Bay Area! I have always had a comfortable and enjoyable experience, especially in the historical theater during midnight showings or special events (as I write this...sitting through credits of Dark Night Marathon movie #1).  If anybody is in Alameda they should definitely stop by!< /Review>

<review>Great eats delivered to your seat! If you are hungry before you go see a movie there is a bar restaurant on the corner that is actually connected to the movie theater. If you begin eating at this restaurant but do not finish and your movie is beginning they will give you a to-go container and you can use the VIP back entrance to go up to your movie with your food and beer< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Part of the old school Theatre Revival movement, as seen in many cities, Alameda Theatre, as part of a new model, actually based on an old model, of customer service, and fun theater experiences, that go beyond to just coming and watching a movie. This lovingly restored theater both some of the nicest interior of any theater in United States, and is noted in the Guinness Book of World Records, as having the brightest theater projector in the world. Also, it is a nice break from the often overcrowded Emeryville, and Berkeley Theater scene. It is also a center for Community Affairs, where they have a talent night comma and often hold dramatic presentation to a place, poetry, music, and other performances there. A really nice place overall, and a nice combination of modern and classical theater elements.< /text>

i enjoy every time i go to the Alameda Theater. The first screen is their historical screen and i spend more time staring at the architecture then i do actually watching the movie. This place is awesome for two reasons: They are independently owned and operated, as well as they offer a military discount.< /Text>

Only Movie theater in Alameda. Good screens and Dolby sound and 3D only down is that seats are still a little old (not the recliner installed in most movies) and limited reserved seating. Other than that nice theater, offers food beer and wine and off course every other treat served in movies.
Enjoy your popcorns and a movie ;)< /Review>

<Gmap_id>0x808f86be0f8c89dd:0x7b58c36ce6683445< /Gmap_id><review>This independent cinema shows first run movies in the historic theater (completely restored and decorated) and the newly constructed cineplex (hiding behind the historic theater so it doesn't ruin the magnificent facade). The historic theater has a balcony, too.  In addition to the usual popcorn and such, after 5 p.m. you can order beer and wine.

One unique feature is that you can order food and drinks from the grill next door, and have it delivered to your seat during the movie. While there is a more limited menu than at the grill itself, it's still a decent selection.

Friday and Saturday nights, the historic theater hosts "Alameda's Got Talent" prior to the main feature. The theater also hosts special events, such as two New Year's Eve parties (one more family-oriented and alcohol free, the other with a no-host bar).< /review>< time>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I love this theater! I always purchase the reserved seats online in advance - they’re the same price and it’s great not to have to worry if you’ll find a seat if the show’s sold out. Be warned though, inevitably someone will try to sit in your reserved seats and you might have to kick them out (which my husband secretly loves to do - I think he enjoys the mini power trip). With reserved seats you can also get food or drinks from the Cinema Grill delivered right to your seat in the theater!< /text>< Gmap_id>

Food! Actual food! Check with the restaurant next door for special seating and meal packages for your movie.
Brilliantly refurbished.
Reliable nearby parking free after 6pm.

Awesome main theater, so huge, and such a great restoration. I wish they'd schedule what's in the big theater more than a couple days ahead; they'd probably get bigger crowds. If you want to see the lastest box office hit, at short notice, and expect the theater not to be sold out, not full, this is the place. But be aware which movie is in the Historic, it's easy to get bait and switched into the multiplex.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Great old theater in Alameda (heck, the only one!)

It's not super high tech but always comfortable, the staff is nice, they've got all the new movies and show a lot of old ones too.

The biggest plus is the restaurant next door and being able to buy beer and food and take it right on in (you can buy beer inside too but it is a bit pricey).</text>< response>

During the late 1980's we danced to New Wave/Alternative music as teenagers in the lobby and the place was called The Twilight Zone. It was a great place & so much FUN for for us youngster at the time. I had no idea the huge theater right behind us in the 1980's the whole time. Was so fun to finally come back a few days ago and experience this place. It's AWESOME! A BIG thank you to everyone who saved this beautiful place for others to enjoy. They don't make places like this anymore.</text>< user_name>

I I sat down and write out everything that I ever wanted in a movie theater, this would be it...

Historic theater with awesome Art Deco design aspects (1932), stadium seating, comfortable chairs, amazing sound and screening quality, reasonable prices ($11.25 compared to AMC's $13.50), awesome food, and YOU CAN DRINK BEER while enjoying your movie.

This is basically the best movie theater of all time.  Ya, I said it.<//text>

Has the old-fashioned allure of an historic play theater. I loved the atmosphere with upstairs seating and decorative walls and lighting. Came here for Star Wars TFA and it was an amazing experience, though the sound systems aren't as advanced as other places. Come here for a slightly different take on your monthly movie date.<//text>

<Date>1487009452155<//Date><rate>3<//rate><Review>Nice theater, but their concession stand can use some improvement. It had one of the worse popcorn and their staff there was more into goofing off and flirting with each other instead of taking care of the customer. When I asked for a receipt, I was told their machine was broken (yet the customer before me it was working). Their Slurpee was more on the watery side and it was a bit sweeter than I remember.

But their cineplex was nice. Their sound system was well balanced and the seats were comfortable.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<name>Kyle Wolfe< /name><text>I go here very frequently because it's the best theatre in terms of technical quality, but the service here is terrible. I've been forced to have to leave without buying tickets multiple times because one of my friends in a large group doesn't have an ID with their date of birth. If you are under 18, you cannot buy R tickets for other people without ID and are very strict about checking for it. I've had friends who have been turned away with their college student picture ID because it didn't specify a date of birth. If you bring a large group, expect to be asked for everyone to show ID, make sure everyone had their DOB listed. If one person doesn't have valid ID, you will not be able to buy a ticket for them. They are also very strict about bringing outside food and drinks in. I use to bring soda in my jacket but now they will check you at the entrance and confiscate any outside food and beverages. While the candy and drinks aren't reasonably priced, the popcorn is. You can get 50¢ refills which is very nice. Just know that if you get up to get a refill and try to come back into the theatre, the attendant will stop you and ask to see your ticket. This system of checks is honestly getting out of hand, it makes it a real hassle to have an enjoyable experience.< /text>< date>

<review>The theater is great but the whole relationship between it and the grill next door is over the top.  The reserved seating for the grill is not fair to all movie goers who paid the same for the show.</review>< pictures>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>I always enjoy going to the Alameda theatre. Parking can be difficult at times although there is a parking structure on the side, street parking and a parking lot directly across the street..since it is right off of the main shopping area it can get tight at peak times.
The theatre itself is really nice, staff are friendly, it is very clean & they show current movies. They also have fun retro nights where they play retro movies, a moms club for moms with small babies, talent shows ( can't remember when or how often) and general fun stuff going on to bring in the community. Lastly, they have a deal worked out with the adjoining restaurant so you can order food to your seat in the movie. No more settling for popcorn and a hot dog when you csn order sliders, fries, a salad..you name it. Its a fun theatre!<//text>< user_id>

An amazing theatre with so much history that has been artfully restored. I have seen many movies here but my latest trip takes the cake. While in line for the first showing of Rogue One, something unique to any of my previous Star Wars experiences occurred. Instead of the typical wait in line outside u til about an hour before showtime, they let us sit in our theater 3 hours before showtime in their very comfy chairs. You can enjoy some fine treats and alcoholic beverages for those 21+. Wonderdul theatre!<//Text>

This has become one of my favorite theaters in the Bay Area. The theater is art deco style and harkens back to the classic movie theater days, yet the theater is big, has 2 levels, multiple screens, and is very up to date. They do have a historic part of the theater too which has a balcony and give that classic movie feel. Great atmosphere!<//Text>

< Review>
My 2nd favorite bay area movie theater after Oakland's Grand Lake Theater. Great location surrounded by awesome restaurants, great parking, Burma Superstar, Tuckers Ice Cream and more surround the theater. Awesome theater with old school charm of the 1920s coupled along with updated sound and style. Great place to watch a movie and enjoy the evening.< /Review>

Great local theatre with a lot of charm and community-feel. During NBA championships or the World Cup they'll host viewings. Try to catch a movie in the historic theatre (theatre 1) - only the just released movies will play there.< /text>

Beautifully restored theater in the heart of downtown Alameda with great staff and service. It's fun to get to the bistro next door before the show and reserve your seats while you're eating.< /review>

Do you remember going to the theater at South Shore when it was a 2 screen cinema that played movies that had already been out for months?  How about driving down to Union City because it was the closest theater that was nice.  I do.  This place has been a blessing since coming back.  It now serves food and alcohol much like the Kabuki Theater in SF.</review>

The theatre lobby and screening rooms have a wonderful ambiance, and the tickets are slightly cheaper than at other theatres. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because at the movie I went to see, the sound was a bit muffled by the acoustics of the theatre, making it slightly difficult to hear the performers on screen.</review>

The theatres are old fashioned and has a very unique atmosphere when you walk in. Their building was so unique, I asked the ticket booth staff if I can peak into their main theatre and it was absolutely stunning.< /Review>

Love the retro look and feel of the lobby, all theaters clean and comfy, and if you want to dine and watch a movie they have the option of dinner and a movie, order food and your ticket at cinema grill(which is next door) and have your food and drink brought over to you in the theater while you sit in the reserved sitting which is awesome.< /Review>

You also can get food and drinks delivered to you while waiting for the movie to start. Friendly staff, especially the ticket collector. (Dont know his name but he was cool) Bathroom is decent and clean. They have seats which is totally convenient. Although that was my first time there, I will definitely go again and again. Also the previews before the previews were local previews of Alameda businesses and community events/blurbs. (Awesomesauce)<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>My wife and I took our daughter to see the trolls movie.  It was clean and fun.  If you go into the diner that's part of the theater, you can have them deliver food and drinks to you while you enjoy your movie.  I would definitely do it again.  Prices in alameda are higher, so expect to spend more for a movie and concesion visit here.  Remeber though, the food and drinks are delivered, so no clumsy business.< /review>< Pictures>

Exelent theater, you can have food and drinks delivered during the show, seats recline, all the new hits and a bunch of events all year round, and you can rent it out for whatever you want.</Text>

I love so much about the Alameda Theater - the building, the movie choices, the bathrooms!

But . . .  we had to walk out of a movie today because the sound was TOO LOUD.  First the advertisements before the movie were loud, shrill and harsh, and then the movie The Hitman's Bodyguard was deafening any time the pace picked up.  My friend and I were not the only ones to walk out.  With headaches.

Alameda Theater:  Please turn down the volume.<//text>

Great sound, great video, and there was a showcase before the movie. Definitely worth the price of admission-- I was very impressed by the entertainment they provided at no extra cost.< /text>

I LOVE the Alameda Theatre. You get super friendly service from the moment you walk in? The theatre itself is beautiful if you're an art deco fan, with its opulent gold gilded trim, floral swirls and grand staircases flanking the lobby. Until they got an espresso machine, they'd let you bring in Peet's coffee -- pretty flexible! The last two times I've been there, we've gotten to see Steve perform magic tricks before the previews started -- very entertaining and a personal touch. There was a problem with the projector tonight, but other than that it's always seemed to go smoothly. By the way, I've never paid for parking to see a movie here, but then they don't charge after 5pm....</Review>

The main hall where they show first run movies is a great place to check out the newest blockbuster. The additional halls are all new, state of the art theaters with comfy seats to boot. There's also some great food options on the block and in and around Park street in general. A favorite of mine is my ritual of a burger and a beer from Burgermeister either pre or post film.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating><user_name>Brian Cossar< /user_name>< GmapID>

Extremely loud theater. We always ask to turn the volume down but that never actually happens. Everytime we go we hear see everyone talking about the volume. Many people get up to go ask for the volume to be turned down. A lot of parents with kids under 10 end up having to leave 1/2 way through the movie. This happens even at noon show times and the mommy and me showings. You would think in a place like Alameda they would respect families with small children more.<//text>

After the city of Alameda GAVE the owner of this theatre over 10 million dollars of our tax money, and 10 years of tax free business. The theatre buys the very expensive and bad resteraunt next door again with city tax payer money and a guarantee of tax free business operation. In order to get a half way good seat (alibit one with food from the resteraunt spilled all over it that hasn't been cleaned in years) you have to buy absurdly expensive food from the resteraunt.

Save your money, wait for the movie to come out on DVD sit at home in clean seats and watch the movie in comfort. Maybe the city council learn something going forward and stops giving hard earned tax dollars to private business repeatedly.</review>

Today the theater screen isn't working. At the ticket booth the cashier isn't sure why it's not working or when it will be working. Asked for a manager and after waiting for awhile he didn't show. Terrible and disappointing. The website lists the time.<//text>

The staff are really awesome, and the prices are very fair. $11 per adult tickets, $6.50 for a large popcorn. Not bad... You can also pre order tickets online, especially for high demand movies. Be aware though, this isn't like tge modern theaters that blast A/C like they are recreating the ice age. Theater might get warm, especially for a packed auditorium.

The location is perfect for grabbing dinner and then dessert at the many boba or froyo establishments in walking distance! Parking us also really easy around here too!< /Text><response>None<//response><user_id>110288469148184652948</user_id>< username>

I remember working at this theater snack bar before it closed in the late 70's. It used to be like a center island in the middle of the lobby. The balconies were accessible for the one big original screen. The seats up there were suspiciouly nasty back in the day. I remember old Al, the old usher guy. The theater manager at the time was a guy named Pedderson. I think he kinda hated life and wasn't very nice. I later heard the guy died from a heart attack

The old screen curtains were ratty and full of soda and food stains. The hidden upper balcony store rooms where the snack bar supplies were stored were dark and dank. Probably the walls leaked as early as that if not before. Kinda spooky. I'm just glad I never spotted any rats or roaches.

Back then the giant "Alameda" neon sign outside was broken and never lit up. The marquee bulbs on the underside of the entrance overhang were always mostly burned out. The old box office was a small booth outside in the center of the front walk under the marquee overhang.

The old Ryders Diner and then later the Record Factory Store used to be where the new added multiplex screens and bistro/bar are now on the corner. I like the new theater now. It should've always remaind a theater. Too bad it never had a great Mighty Wurlitzer organ like the Oakland Paramount. That would've been cool.

It wasn't exactly the most ideal job. My fondest memory was being able to see the first Star Wars movie for free as many times I wanted. A lot of free movies and old Al looked the other way. Crappy job but good times. My first real job.</Text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) In Mexico the offer of cinemas is much better, starting from that point, this place falls short with its sweetness, the popcorn is very good. It is a very beautiful old and large theater.
The sound quality is good.
There is parking nearby, very good for that.
There is an exhibition of classic films which gives it a super plus.

(Original)
En Mexico la oferta de cinemas es mucho mejor, partiendo de ese punto, este lugar se queda corto con su dulceria, las palomitas son muy buenas.  Es un teatro antiguo y grande muy bello.
La calidad del sonido si que es bueno.
Hay estacionamiento cerca, muy bien por eso.
Hay exposición de películas clasicas lo que le da un super plus.</review>
