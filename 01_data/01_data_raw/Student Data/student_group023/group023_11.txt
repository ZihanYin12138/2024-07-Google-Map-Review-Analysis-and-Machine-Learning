I have never been so happy! I am so grateful  for my fairy gown mother, Ruby! She made me feel so special when I was starting to get discouraged. “No one ever cries alone in my presence”- steel magnolias, not only did Ruby make me feel so comfortable but her unforgettable use of quotes to add a dose of laughter and love. I cried so many happy tears. Thank you Ruby- I am eternally grateful for you. I mean that.</Text>

They were so friendly and helpful by working with me to find my dream wedding dress. After looking at multiple stores and finding nothing that I could actually try on in my size, they made me feel amazing that everything came in a size where I could really see the full fit of the dress. Thank you so much ladies!! Awesome experience!<//text>

Della Curva and Lisa and Bert are truly amazing! I grew up in southern California and now live in Alabama. I was traveling home for Christmas and knew I needed to go visit this plus size dress store as there is nothing like it near me. It was my first time trying on wedding dresses and I found the one! My mom and I  had the whole store to ourselves  to pick out and try on any dress that I wanted and I felt so confident knowing that all the dresses in the store would fit me. They had a large selection of every style imaginable. The prices were extremely reasonable as were shipping charges back to Alabama. I cannot thank them enough for how amazing this experience was and it will be a fond memory me and my mom can look back on. I cannot wait to wear my beautiful wedding dress back in sweet home Alabama!</Text>

As a curvy bride, I am so grateful this store exists. Gown searching can be nerve-racking enough without the anxiety of wondering if the gowns will even fit. That is not a problem here! And the staff are so knowledgeable. What a great experience. Thank you for offering all brides a place to have that bridal experience we all dream of.</Review>

The shop was beautiful and my consultant Emily was excellent at her job. She listened to my feedback about each dress I tried and right at the end of my appointment she pulled the perfect dress that had all the elements I was looking for. I never would have picked the dress off of the hanger. She is truly skilled at her job. The experience felt personalized to me and my guests were treated nicely. I previously had an appointment at David’s Bridal and the experience at Della Curva was so much more luxurious. Professionally trained staff, gorgeous windows with natural light to model the dresses, comfortable chairs, water offered, etc. It’s not easy being a bride during a pandemic but Della Curva made my experience feel special!<//review>

I loved my experience with Della Curva . I got my wedding dress here! I had looked at several stores and was so happy that I found my dress. The ladies were so friendly and I loved that I was able to get my dress altered there as well. I even wanted to come in to try my dress on again with my bridesmaids and they were more than accommodating. They have kept in touch with me since my wedding! I would definitely recommend looking for your wedding dress there!<//review>

She walked out with her wedding dress!! The store is quiet and beautiful.  The staff are kind and very helpful and they have such a great offer that there is a dress for everyone.  And the dresses! So beautiful!! I have never been excited about a wedding dress the way I was excited over my sister in her gorgeous wedding gown.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Ladies, if you are tired of having bridal boutiques shove you into size 4 and 6 sample dresses when you are CLEARLY neither of those sizes....stop torturing yourself immediately and make an appointment with Della Curva.

Happy Perk #1: all dress sizes are 16 and up! no body shaming here! Sara and all the other women here are lovely, fantastic people who will help you feel as gorgeous as you are.

Happy Perk #2: they truly have quality selection of dresses and the women REALLY know their stuff. Working with Sara was fantastic - just by getting to know me and my body type for a short period of time, she picked out MY dress instantly and made me try it on first. Every dress after that paled in comparison. :)

Happy Perk #3: they do not rush you through your appointment! You can ponder, question, and twirl around in your dresses with your bridal entourage without a time crunch.

and lastly....they are just outstanding professionals who strive to really make sure you have a happy experience there. Whether it's working with you to finance your dress, or just to offer countless suggestions....

I am SO happy with my dress and I can't thank Sara enough for being my "gal" and helping this fellow east coaster feel beautiful and special.<//Text></record>

I am so thankful that I found Della Curva! I drove quite a ways to get to this store, but I am so happy I did! Ruby is absolutely phenomenal! Her energy and customer service is really what made my experience that much more magical. My entire party was so happy to have her apart of the process. She helped me find the dress that had EVERY SINGLE DETAIL that I was wanting. If you are a curvier bride, and are able to make it to this amazing gem, do not waste your time anywhere else, come to Della Curva!< /Review>

Our appointment was booked on a Sunday, when this beautiful bridal store is typically closed. Boutique is a little hard to find, on the 2nd floor but there is metered street and parking lot spaces.

Not only was our appointment confirmed by text the day prior, we instantly felt welcomed as soon as we walked into the gorgeous store that is Della Curva. Alexa was waiting for us with her grace and patience. Our group felt totally taken care of and we felt no pressure and the space was so comfortable with plenty of seating for our 6 person group. Alexa listened as we spoke about what our bride wanted and she went in our direction and had great comments for us too.

Our appointment was probably really long but we really appreciated that we got to take the time to try a bunch of different styles for the bride. NOW let's get to the dresses.... they were all so beautiful, seriously what a great selection and finally a plus sized store that carries actual pretty wedding dresses, we had previously gone to David's Bridal and we would describe that experience as a frozen meal that has already expired, compared to Della Curva that was a hot, well executed steak or vegetarian dish, basically there was a dress that would work for any bride! Also, the prices were so reasonable, truly getting a value with these dresses, but seriously Alexa was amazing and we can't wait to make our final order!

Thank you again, 10/10 recommend Della Curva, if you come here, you will think about getting divorced JUST to go shopping here again for another beautiful dress.< /review>

<review>Based on other reviews I must have been there on a bad day.  I was so excited to try this salon but it did not live up to expectations.  We arrived about 45 min early which might have been the problem but we offered to come back and they said no, its fine.  Ruby told us she likes to start with 5 dresses so to pick them out.  She gave us no guidance just would say no if it was too small or too expensive.  As the person who knows the sizes and prices shouldn't she be picking the dresses?  I don't want to walk around looking at all of the dresses I can't try on.   It felt like she had a style of dress she thought I would want because she kept pulling VERY similar dresses.  They do have a beautiful salon but I would recommend Strut Bridal in Long Beach any day.  As a 28/30 I could try on every dress in their salon which was a much better experience.< /review><pics>None</pics><userid>107689440121175717678</userid>< rating>

This Bridal Salon is the absolute best. They have such a great quality and selection of dresses. Not only are the dresses priced fair, the customer service is above and beyond. My consultant Ruby was so amazing. She really took the time to understand what I was looking for and she was conscious of my budget. I had been to multiple bridal salons trying dresses on and not a signal consultant helped me into my dresses. She was so compassionate and honest. If I asked for her honesty she gave it to me and for me that is something I valued. Della Curva also had the best dressing rooms I had seen. It was so refreshing to have a mirror and a big room to just take a minute to see the dress myself before going out in front of everyone. I can not rate this store high enough!< /Text>

<text>So many dresses and they made me feel so comfortable. I cried a few times due to building anxiety but (I wish I could remember her name, short woman with dark hair extremely pleasant) did everything she could to make it as painless as possible. I'm sure most people would not find the experience painful at all. The store and selection of dresses were amazing and so is the staff.<//text>< pics>

I found this gem online for my best friend who is getting married and was looking for her perfect dress (after trying a few other places). The appointment was wonderful and ended with a Yes to the dress. Sarah is so kind, professional and knowledgeable. She was telling us the history of some of the dress styles and providing genuine service. Do yourself a favor and go here first!</Text>

Sarah was very helpful and very real about the experience. I was a little intimated by the shop but in the end I loved the privacy and that there were many gowns for me to choose from within my price range.  I found my dream dress and can't wait to wear it on my wedding day. So thankful i found this shop and Sarah!</text>

<text>I searched everywhere for a plus size dress and after a friend recommended Della Curva I checked out the website. This is where I fell in love with my dream dress (Della Curva Website). I took a screen shot of my dream dress. When I got there they said the dress was discontinued. I was a lil bummed, but still excited to try on dresses!!! Yes ladies you can try on dresses that fit!!! I was in heaven!!! A quaint, beautiful and elegant shop tucked away on Ventura. I was helped by a very sweet young women Alexis and Sara. While trying on a few dresses Alexis came to me and said look what we found!!!! It was my dream dress!!! I couldnt believe it!!! She said it's your size... I was so excited. My family loved the first few dresses but when I walked out with this dress everyone was saying that's the one for you. Once I laid eyes on myself in the mirror and after seeing the reactions, I instantly had tears rolling down my face. This was the dress!!! I said yes to the dress!!! And the best part was since it was discontinued and a floor dress... it was a $2,000.00 for half price. I left feeling like the luckiest woman in the world.

On my wedding day 9/9/18 I cant even count how many people absolutely loved my dress. They said it was stunning, was made for me, gorgeous, I looked like a princess, breath taking and they all asked where I got it from!!! DELLA CURVA!!!

Thank you Sara and Alexis for all your help. I will never forget the day I said yes to the dress and how easy you all made it. You made our special day even more special!!! Thank you again!!!</text>< user_id>

<review>Della Curva is one of the best decisions I made in my LIFE!! Ahh😍 Flew all the way from Hawaii, had no other options going in and I am so happy I came here and met Sara. I am a for real plus size girl and I tried on tons of dresses (so hard to believe I had a selection) .. And found the ONE!!! It's like a fairytale and I am so blessed to have found Della Circa. Don't hesitate ladies and wuteva😉❤❤</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Sarah was so helpful and she picked out a dress that I was *this* close to buying.  She really, really knows her stuff.  She knew exactly why that dress looked better on me than another dress due to my body type and height.
Also, the prices of the dresses are spot on.  Unfortunately I found another dress I fell in love with at Nordstrom. I say unfortunate because I would have MUCH rather have given Sarah the business as my experience at Nordstrom paled severely in comparison to Della Curva.  I highly recommend you come here.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Could not have asked for a better experience. Sara was my fairy godmother i swear to you she is absolutely phenomenal. She was a blessung to work with so amazingly friendly and with the little amount of time i have until my wedding and shes still getting me the dress of my dreams. This bridal shop is hands down the best from the amazing staff to the beautiful dresses and the whole store is just so perfect its magical. Ive already told my whole family about this place. Seriously girls if youre looking for a beatiful dress with no stress and no feeling down on yourself go here now!! I promise you wont be disappointed. Thank you Della Curva for making my dreams a reality and i cant wait for the big day ♡<//Review>

Great tech support. Took 10 minutes out of their busy day to check my rifle. Determined and fixed the issue on the spot, and sent me on my way. Great info and advice, answering all my questions. No wonder I keep going back.< /review>

Bought my first airsoft gun here, workers were extremely nice and explained everything I needed to know. When my gun broke (not the store’s fault, the manufacturer sold them a defect) they explained to me what was wrong and fixed it for me for a good price. These guys know what they’re doing.<//review>

I have become a regular here since getting into Airsoft.
Friendly staff, good product selection. Definitely a one-stop-shop.
Really good selection of AEG's and pistols. Lots of gear too.

Expect potential for a small line on weekends, as the store's capacity is only a few at a time during COVID.

Just note their website stock status does not necessarily reflect that of this particular physical location, so give them a call and they will be happy to check if they have an item.<//Review>

<Text>Came here to get my first full setup of gear after borrowing and only playing once or twice a year for ~6 years.

The guys who work here were extremely nice and easy to work with. They didn't guide me too much but were there to answer questions I had and were ready to answer those questions in depth.

Overall I was very comfortable, very happy with the products I got, and ill be going back for a second gun whenever the day comes that I need a second.

The only negative was that they were out of stock on batteries and battery chargers when I got my gun so I had to go elsewhere for those. My one piece of advice when going here is to call ahead to ensure they have what you're looking for in stock - if they do then I would highly recommend going to the store as it was a good experience</Text>< pictures>

Walked in not knowing much about Airsoft guns, and walked out with a good starter gun at a great price. Customer service was some of the best I have experienced in a longtime. They took the time to explain the differences between the guns and showed me the best ones for a beginner. They showed me all the features and how to use the gun. I was also able to test fire the gun at their firing range.<//Text>

< Review>
I PRE-ORDERED some gear through the website and went through the card verification like the company asked to "protect against fraud". My order was then canceled days later and when I call to ask why it was cancelled they tell me that they didn't have anymore inventory and the don't hold items ON A PRE-ORDER! I'm then told that the card wasn't verified until Monday morning when I sent in the verification on Friday afternoon and was told the shipping department probably didn't see it because they had gone home even though I sent it at 1:30PM. Avoid the headache order with Evike instead they at least TRY to fix the situation if they make a mistake instead of brush it off and say they can't do anything else to help the customer.<//Review>

Spent the money to Polarstar my Airsoft gun only to walk out without testing the gun myself. Customer service was great but they did not have the necessary items for me to test my Airsoft gun out after spending a pretty penny.<//review>

<Text>Came here with my partner and we had a fantastic time! The staff was nice and the rental stuff was easy enough to figure out. The only thing was the other players were very very rude, and I told one of the refs, but he told me it was part of the game. I'm not sure that's the game I want to play. Anyways, I had a great time and my partner had a glorious time, I would come back any time, but I will request to not be group with as*ho*es next time.< /Text>< pictures>

I feel they are very honest with their work and recommendations, and they do want to help you walk out with a great performing airsoft gun. They will not try to sell you parts that don't contribute to improving your rifle. Great group of slightly nerdy staff who really know their stuff, they are also knowledgeable on all rules and regulations involved in this sport.</Review>

Amazing customer service and part of my air soft gun broke so they gave me free parts to try and fix it. The employees are social and work with you to find a perfect gun for you from there large selection of quality products.< /review>

<Text>One of the guys were super chill. Helped out  slot and whenever I had to ask a question the one guy (sorry I don't know his name) he always gave me a good positive answer and didn't seem to mind anything. The same guy also helped me install a new grip for the gun and was super helpful!

Some days it can be packed for such a small store, making it take a while just to grab ammo but they are the only one in SD. Good prices, and great selection in guns. I've had an order take a while do to lost forms, but this is an isolated incident and they didn't charge labor. Overall a good store, but lacking a bit in part selection and number of staff.</Review>

Very positive experience!  Lawrence was awesome!  As a regular firearm shooter, I was looking for a way to save money on ammunition and still get semi-realistic training.  Based on my requirements, he pointed me to gas blow-back versions of my weapons, which provide the recoil (albeit minimized) and realistic round count that I'm used to.  He let me test fire the weapons to get a sense of their feel and behavior.  I'm in!  I've already talked a friend of mine into trying out airsoft with me because of my experience at Airsoft Extreme San Diego with Lawrence.  I will definitely be making my purchase from AEX.<//Text>

Very bad customer service and the sales guy and the manager have a very nasty attitude. Also they lie. I once bought a g&g rifle and with that deal they made the bbs price cheap and when I went next time I got another rifle that was a g&g and they said that brand doesn't come with deals. They try to rip you off. I don't suggest anyone buying from them. I would suggest that you drive to Los Angeles to better stores there.< /text>

Bad customer service, plain and simple. When you walk in, you are bombarded with a dozen pimply faced 15 year olds chatting it up on how cool this or that is. The customer service associates are no more than 16 and could care less about what you want if they are in the middle of a conversation. After inquiring on .30 gram ammo, I was told they were out of stock. However the sales associate then attempted to sell me some cheap .25s saying they were just as good as any top brand .30s. I expect most of their sales come from their online store, because I will never visit this location again in person.<//Review>

The people here are very nice and knowledgeable about airsoft. They know what they are doing and help me find what I need whenever I go there. Their customer service is great and the people who work here are friendly. Their inventory is stocked with essential equipment for airsofting along with a large complement of weapons to purchase there.</review>

I needed a hopup bucking to upgrade my DMR so I chose this company because it was the closet one near me. Transaction was good but during delivery the parcel needed signature required. Of course I wasn’t home and missed this. So I had to wait until the weekend until I could get.

I understand if this was a gun or if it is too big to fit into a mailbox but why they couldn’t of just dropped this small, tiny, 1 inch item into my mailbox? Or leave under my door mat? If you ask me, this was a complete waste of my time!< /Text>

Just getting back into airsoft and bought an ak74 from them. Tryed it out that night around 6 and it wasn't feeding correctly and the mag jammed to the point where it didn't work I called in that same day and they were almost closed so I couldn't come.back to return it. Came back the next morning right at 11 and the gun was shooting fine using their battery and mag but still wasn't shooting well enough for me to keep it and I had to pay a 15% restocking fee!!!<//Review>

Everything I buy here never breaks they have guality stuff for sure most the staff is friendly there's is 1 member who is rude though
And seems more money hungry than the rest .. but regardless place still has great merch I recommend shopping here. Just don't come to get your guns fixed they most likely lie just to get money from you and do research dont get recommendations they will lead you rite to the most expensive item even if it doesn't match your gun it's sad but just get what you want and leave cause its quality< /Review>

Compared to dealing with Evike issues this place is a 6 star.

Other than the fact that I have gone in for a battery and left with a hi-capa it's awesome! But seriously, the best place in Southern California for HiCapa parts. Lawrence and staff know their stuff.<//Text>

<Review>This is definitely a great place to get airsoft gear. There's a wide selection of guns and parts. It doesn't take long to find what you need. The customer service was amazing! The guys working there were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. You just needed to flag one of them down as it was quite busy there. Regarding the reviews that had bad customer service; maybe they've improved since then, or maybe you just came in on bad days. Contrary to logic, try coming in on common busy days such as Saturday, you'll probably avoid the "bad" workers with all the customers they need to service.</Review>< Pics>

Awesome place to go for airsoft guns. I bough a 1911 green gas blowback for $95 and my friends cost $120 and he thinks mine is much better quality. Awesome place if you are just starting airsoft or buying  500-600 fps sniper riffle. Really cheap too. Has everything too a beginner or advanced airsoft player needs.< /review>

It's important becuase once you have a airsoft bb gun you get to learn about it .
Just like the real ammo guns..</review>

<text>I come to AEX regularly now that I've gotten back into the sport. The guys are super nice, really knowledgeable, and above all are not jerk to plebs like me. Recently bought a wolverine SMP setup and they helped answer all my questions and steered me in the right direction of tanks/regs that were in my budget. Great place to shop for airsoft gear<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbff9707ddef83:0xeb3d4a16c5149d98</Gmap_id></record>

I've been going to AEX since summer of 2013. TJ, Dave & Laurence are all very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or a veteran, they will always point you in the right direction. I stop by the shop at least twice a month to say hello and pick up a few things. Great products, great service, great people, AEX is my go-to place for anything airsoft related.

P.S. The AEX brand rifles are the best bang-for-your-buck guns on the market. They are phenomenal out of the box, and with minor upgrades they are just unreal.< /Review>

Great Airsoft store, it's pretty much the only one in San Diego and that's just fine. I've been to the big 3 Airsoft stores in Los Angeles that everyone talks about ( Evike, Airsoft Gi and Airsplat ) Evike probably once a week or so and it's a nightmare compared to AEX. And while AEX might not have EXACTLY what I want when I want it, they usually still have what I need just a different brand and or price.
There is a lot of inexpensive airsoft gear out there that looks great online only to buy it and have it shipped and find out it's just utter garbage that looked good in the picture so it's great to have a store stocked up with parts that you can look at and feel in person.

Anyways, Good work AEX
Brent.<//text>

The Store and staff rock at this place the only problem i have is that the store is super cramped there is always a ton of military wanna bee kids hanging out in there which doesn't make help with space. other than that store was recommended by a family member and i would never go anywhere else.<//Text>

And they act as if they hate their lives, and they are very lazy. They sometimes got what you need though.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Awesome shopping experience! Was my first time here. I came in for an online order I had placed but decided to look what else the store had to offer. The store associate was very helpful and offer me a variety of assortments that I was looking for. I I definately indulged in all the goodies but I will surely be back. Its definitely a shopping experience you will have to do in person unless you're a long time customer and know what you want.

Well stocked and sometimes they have free samples.

Whenever I come, I am asked 3-5 times by the staff if I need help finding something. Each time I say no, and I've noticed them watch me as I browse around the store. Whenever I am holding a bottle of vitamins they will try to hold it up front for me, and I say no thank you. I'm not sure if the staff is just overly helpful or if they assume that I am stealing. Either way, it's a bit annoying. I've come many times over the last couple months and each visit is the same. There is one staff member that isn't so overbearing like the other two, but I mostly encounter the other 2. A couple times I decided not to make a purchase and go to Vitamin World instead, because I was a bit insulted.<//Review>

Since 1956, The Bakersfield Museum of Art has been showcasing fine art and is said to be one of the city’s top attractions.

Inside this large museum are two large galleries and two smaller ones. The permanent collection features art by local artists. The rest of the rotating exhibits feature a mix of art from all over.

The outside grounds of the museum are home to some beautiful gardens and sculptures.</Review>

The exhibits are great and educational for kids. We went to the rainforest and to the gem and skin exhibits which were a great learning experience. I honestly was impressed the most by the beautiful butterflies.</text>

< Review>
I love this place but was disappointed the Rain Forest exhibit was closed. My favorite part was simulated flying like a pterosaur - the new name for pterodactyls. Lots of fun. Scientists have learned a lot about them since I went to school. Also enjoyed displays about evolution of the earth's crust and the beautiful gift shop. Prices in the cafe are a bit expensive tho. Still worth a visit!< /Review>

< Review>
Visited with my daughter and her fiancé as a possible venue for their wedding. The museum is beautiful; the grounds were also very beautiful, very green and well maintained overall. But the gazebo needs a little bit of a refurbishing and paint, and apparently there was a mishap with a prior landscaper where some bushes and vines were affected. But they are coming back nicely. Would have been a great wedding venue, only the time frame was off for us.<//Review>

Always a great place to visit. You can walk back to the gardens in back and sit in the gazebo, something I like doing for lunch. They have good events regularly, and interesting exhibits.< /text>

HOWEVER
I Purchased a family   membership and was told I could bring my 5 list grandchildren who where written on the card by the worker who sold the membership  to me.
When I brought my  5 grandchildren to the Laurie Brock museum  on 8-1-18 I was told only 2 of them were allowed at one time....
Fraud
The reason I purchased the membership  was so I could have time with all of the cousins together.  I asked about it at time of purchase and was told, no problem, just show the card.  Lies...
Very disappointing.
8-1-18
Just asked to speak with a supervisor
I was informed that 2 adults and 6 children  are  allowed and the girl at admissions  made a mistake.</review>< Date>

We stopped without any expectations as we were passing through-just wanted to see what art was happening in Bakersfield.  Wow, were we blown away by the great art and curation.  A nice mix of local and international artists.  The different exhibits meant there was something for every taste.  You can easily spend a couple hours and come away refreshed!</Text>

Beautiful venue. Have not been inside the main building, but attended a wedding here in the garden and it was an excellent choice, especially for Bakersfield.</Text>

<Text>Has a nice collection of art. Didn't get to go into the garden but the inside had a large collection. They usually have a monthly special which is nice. Small entrance fee making it even more reason to go.< /Text><user>114859552600808257435</user>< Response>

<username>Rick Rowland< /username><Resp>None< /Resp><Review>I'll be very honest,I love the artwork but I don't ever want to go back there to visit due to an employee,Juana Martinez,who continuously takes photos of me without permission and doesn't care whether you like it or not . She seems to  be more on her personal cell phone taking sneaky pictures of people than doing her job .I don't mean to talk down about her ,only her actions and that is why I can't go there to support the museum.<//Review><rate>1<//rate>< Time>

The sales reps that I dealt with at the store were kind, patient and very helpful;  Knowledgable about their product and up front about costs without a hard sell. it was a pleasant experience after speaking with the chat system on the Verizon website which was not pleasant.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Horrible customer service. Purchased a Gizmo watch during a holiday promotion. Informed credit would appear on my statement the following month. Five months later, I still haven’t received credit. I’ve called the store over ten times in the past four months and every single consultant has taken my phone number for the manager to return my call.... I’m still waiting. Don’t waste your time or money at this store. BEWARE: Not an authorized Verizon store!<//review>< Response>

<Review>After an extremely frustrating day of trying to get phone upgrades and receiving poor service at other retailers, we were pleasantly surprised by the customer service we received at GoWireless. Eric was quick to provide straight forward answers to our questions, sat with us on the phone as we contacted corporate for information, and even continued to be happy and helpful when it was clear we were going with another carrier. They truly made our day much easier and I would recommend Eric and Gabe for assistance with the Verizon issues.</Review>< username>

EDIT: I got a call from the district manager, Steve about the mishap and he tried what he could (within his limits) to restore faith in the store. Unfortunately we couldn't come to a reasonable agreement. I still am disappointed with my original experience, but I'm amending my review of the store - in part because I believe that Steve is telling me the truth and would have been able to do a lot more if it wasn't for the time passing (and he just sounds like a nice guy), and in part because in reality, I should have been more persistent at the time to make the correction - which is not actually a huge deal. The phone itself is great - no issues there, just not a dual sim... and whatever, I still like the product. I would still return to this store, I think I would just double check the information I'm given before walking out the door. Was it just a miscommunication? I don't know, but I'm willing to give the salesperson the benefit of the doubt and not blame the store itself for what might have been the mistake of one employee.

ORIGINAL POST: I called the store to see if they had the Note10+ dual sim, they said that they did, then the sales person said that it was the last one that they had, sold it to me, helped me get it activated (minus the dual sim) and then told me that I needed to have Verizon help me set up the dual sim. I wasn't able to get in touch with Verizon until the 14th day after purchase and then found out that I was sold the wrong phone. I spoke with the sales person and she said that I could no longer return the phone. My own fault since I didn't check the model number on the phone until it was too late. Just pretty disappointed that I was lied to in order for them to make a sale.< /text>

I love this store. Matt the manager has gone above and beyond multiple times for me to make sure I have been happy and any issues I've had have been resolved quickly. Richard, Brandon, and Andre are also extremely helpful when I come in even if it's just got a question or finding a chartering cable. My friend got a phone from Richard recently and said it was once of the easiest and most pleasurable experience's ever. I highly recommend this store</text>

I went in to find a phone for my brother and I and the manager Steve helped me out. He did everything to make the process smooth and simple. He listened to what I was looking for and gave me many different options. He was very intuitive and helpful. While I was there I also saw how the employees interacted with the customers and they were all extremely nice and really wanted to jump in and help. Overall this is a great location with awesome people. I really recommend this Verizon location!!</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1439567743307, 'text': 'Awesome to hear Claudia!

BILLY WAS WONDERFUL!!!!  HE KNOWS HIS PRODUCTS AND TOOK CARE OF MY SON AND I BOTH WHEN WE UPGRADED.  IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM (BILLY), I WOULD NOT HAVE UPGRADED MY PHONE AT THIS TIME.  HE JUST MADE EVERYTHING HAPPEN ON TWO PHONES WHILE TENDING TO OTHER CUSTOMERS AND WITHOUT ANY STRAIN HE TOOK CARE OF BUSINESS.  I WOULD CONTINUE TO GO TO THIS LOCATION (NEWBURY PARK) JUST BECAUSE HE IS SO KNOWLEDGEABLE, PROFESSIONAL AND EFFICIENT!!!!</Review>

<text>Came to Verizon in Newbury Park getting phone upgrade. Received the finest service I have ever gotten at a Wireless store. Billy is extremely knowledgeable, quick to come up with alternatives,  and always working to get the best deal for the customer.  On top of all that, pleasant and funny.  Highly recommend him as your next service consultant at Verizon!.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Not as knowledgeable of phones as should be, but did a great job at finding answers and trying to get facts straight and to us.  Some errors in information initially to find out answer was different.  Great job of staff.  But shame on Verizon for not giving these employees enough proper training and support and resources to handle customer needs.  The staff do an amazing job given a very difficult situation to work within.</Text><UserId.>113394026270338651590<//UserId.></record>

I’m not one to complain, but this was honestly one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. I spoke to the manager but she was part of the issue, and she was not very apologetic or understanding. It ended up being almost a three hour process to upgrade my phone.  I accidentally gave them the wrong zip code when they were trying to access my account (I just moved), which I understand did not help things. However, my account then got locked out because the manager tried to access it too many times, kept going after it should have been clear that it was the wrong information.  For some reason, this made them unable to accept my card for payment for 24 hours until my account was unlocked. I had to go the bank and come back with cash. This time a male employee helps me, turns out that cash payments do not post immediately and they cannot upgrade my phone until the payment has posted. Was told it may be anywhere between one hour AND 48 HOURS!! I had no phone at this point, I am upgrading because it stopped working that day. I am expressing my concerns to him and trying to get more information, when he jumps to answer the phone WITHOUT so much as a quick “sorry” or “excuse me”! I was a little upset before that, but at that point I didn’t know what to do except walk out and let him finish his call. Came back an hour later, manager helps me again. The phone she said they had in stock an hour ago is actually not in stock, and I had to get a different color. This wouldn’t be the end of the world, except I know they weren’t  busy enough to have sold out, she just didn’t check properly. THEN the manager goes to the back, supposedly to make a phone call. Had to be at least 30 minutes before she came back, my sale pending the whole time and the other guy on the floor is helping someone else, by the time I leave a line is starting to form. Told her I doesn’t seem like there are enough people working, was informed “we”re working on it, were just short staffed right now” Thank you, I can see that...<//review>

I felt very compelled today to add that I truly love this store and the excellent help.  Billy S. in particular has been so helpful!  After a big move for myself and my family, we felt a bit deer in the headlights, but Billy has provided excellent service!  He gives tips on how to save money and do right by your household needs.  I have already recommended this store and Billy in particular for friends that I have met in my new community.  You go here?  You won't be disappointed.  Billy makes what could be a long errand (think DMV or the post office) very fun and light.  He builds awareness around mobile phones and technology (for those of us that are dinosaurs)  and he explains EVERYTHING in simple lay-mans terms.   You can't go wrong here at this Newbury Park Broadbeck location.  But DO insist on asking for Billy.  He is the best!< /Text>

Just left the store and felt compelled to leave my very first social media review...so here it is...both Bryan and Matthew who have both been helping me have been an amazing and going above and beyond in regards to customer service.  I'm switching to Verizon from Sprint and I couldn't be happier not only with the fact that I  am returning again to Verizon service but to be reminded by these two of why Verizon is the best phone service around and this store is the only one I will come to because these guys go above and beyond without question. Thank you Verizon, and thank you both Bryan and Matt.< /review>

This may be a Verizon Authorized Dealer, but it's also NOT a genuine Verizon store - their deals are not honored by a genuine Verizon store.  They double-talked my wife into getting an iPad, saying that it was just an "exchange" for a tablet previously purchased at a genuine Verizon store, and then put a monthly charge for it on our bill.  They also insisted on a "restocking fee" when we called them on this deception and turned the iPad back in.  We won't shop at this store any more.</Review>

Very unfortunate.  Went into the store to upgrade my old iPhone 5s.  The only issue I had was battery life.  Told them I was willing to look a new phone but I needed the most memory offered and a battery that lasts.  Matt sold me into a new iPhone 7, but lowered the capacity on the phone down to 28GB.  This has caused me numerous problems.  Finally figured out why the phone was slow and glitchy and I couldn't take pix or videos.  I called and was told to go back and they would switch it out.  I showed up at the store and was told they are not a Verizon store but a reseller.  I was told they would need to order the device and would let me know when it is in.  2 weeks later I called and inquired about where the phone was.  I was told it came in a few days after I was originally at the store.  No call from anyone.  I was unable to get to the store before 2 weeks of business travel.  I come back from my trip, shelp back into the store and am now told that it has been longer than 30 days and I now need to either have Matt get an exception from the Verizon rep or BUY a new phone for $700.  Ridiculous.  Simple error.  A small amount of customer service would have saved the situation.  I'm "waiting to hear," and am told that I should keep calling back to see if I can be helped.  I called Verizon directly and they are willing to switch my phone for only $300 extra.  15+ yrs with Verizon doesn't hold much credence.   I'm now shopping carriers for my 7 phone lines.  Horrible service.<//Review>

Hands down best customer service around.  I stopped going to Verizon stores and will stick with Go Wireless Newbury park due to their kind, friendly and awesome staff. The manager Matt goes above and beyond and has helped me on numerous occasions. Will be back again and again.< /Review>

Billy Schmeltz was absolutely amazing. He truly had all the right info. Not once did i feel pressured into buying anything nor he was pushy. He helped me purchase a bundle protective screen for my iPhone and will allow me to get discounts in the future. He went over and above to answer any questions we had. Im sending my kids to purchase future accessories from him<//text>

GoWireless has a C- rating with the BBB??!!!

I cannot begin to describe how disgusted I am with GoWireless as a company, their N.P. store manager Matt, as well as Verizon to a lesser degree, and I will describe our experience in great detail. Similar to what Patrick W here experienced, my Mother and 16yr old Daughter were not only completely and utterly defrauded at this store by a salesman who not only used profanity to describe some of the HTC 1 phones negatively, but when I was made aware of the fraud, went in personally to handle it with the manager Matt, his lack of any actions or promised follow through made it clear that this is how they do business and is indicative of GoWireless as a company.
This all started back in August, when my daughter broke her HTC 1, and went into our local GoWireless store here on Broadbeck Dr., in the Islands shopping center. My Mom took her, since they share a plan together. The salesman they dealt with was aggressive and pushy, and put a bad taste in my daughters mouth. She wanted another HTC 1, as she was already familiar with it, and does very little beyond using it for calls and texting, but the salesman told her that she didn't want that phone, it was, Quote, "A Piece of S#I!" and that she should only get the top of the line HTC model, the HTC 10. He told them that they were eligible for a "Free Upgrade", and conveniently left out that the the full price of the phone would be amortized on her bill. My Mother, being on a fixed income, would certainly not have agreed to the $700+ phone, no how/no way.
Once I was made aware of her now nearly $200 bill, 2 months later after she was complaining of the second bill in a row that was now doubled, I called Verizon to find out what was going on. The Verizon rep explained that this new HTC 10 phone had had been added to the account, as well as insurance on both phones, (My Mother's phone is 4 years old and doesn't need a $15 per month plan!). The Verizon rep also expressed disdain over the situation, and was very apologetic on behalf of Verizon, indicating that these types of situations were anything but uncommon. She said that these Verizon affiliates are well known for these types of tactics, and unfortunately, there was nothing she could do, this would have to be taken up with GoWireless directly.
I called this local GoWireless to find out who the manager was, and after a week, was finally able coordinate time off from work to go in and talk directly with the Manager, Matt. I wanted to give him the opportunity to rectify this issue, and so my Mother and I explained the situation. Matt indicated that he knew who the salesman was, and also alluded to acknowledging that this was anything but the first time there have been issues with that employee. Unfortunately, that salesman no longer works at that location. Matt expressed what appeared to be genuine concern, and promised that he would call me back with an update regarding what could be done on Monday, or Tuesday at the latest. Monday came and went, Tuesday also, then Wed/Thurs/Friday...... no reply. I called Saturday and talked to Matt. It took him a bit to remember who I was/what the situation was, and then just indicated that he had not heard back from anyone at corporate-no mention of why he had not bothered to follow up with a reply earlier to me as promised to indicate this. At this point, his demeanor was one of indifference, and I was done with wasting anymore valuable time waiting for him to do nothing. I asked for his superior's number, and indicated I would take it from here.
I will be contacting Verizon, HTC, the BBB, as well as local media sources, I already have all the contacts from my TV/Motion Picture Product Placement company. The CV here is a realistically small/tight knit community, word gets around quick. It's unfortunate that I do not have positive feedback for GoWireless.<//Review>

There is a gallery, outdoor garden with outdoor art scattered about. Fun place to visit when you're in the neighborhood. Also, you can sign up for woodworking classes. This place is a real treat and should be explored!< /review>

The home tour is amazing, Thursday and Saturday only. The gardens are lovely and filled with indigenous plants and signs in Tongva, the Indigenous language. The gallery has small but wonderful rotating exhibits.</text>

<review>Sam Maloof is a fabulous artisan sculpturing furniture unique in design. His home represents his craftsmanship with architectural structure and furniture designed by him. The whimsical garden  captures your attention with sculpture and a variety of California and Mexican native plants. Eat before you go and be prepared for warm weather. They do sell bagged snacks, bottled beverages, and coffee. If you are artistic you will be inspired.<//review><user_name>Joel Garcia</user_name><Time>1532295017122< /Time>< pictures>

<text>Very disappointed in the director and volunteers. I am a hearing impaired  person that travels with a registered service dog, not an emotional support. My dog is highly trained and extremely well behaved. Yet, they refused to allow her on the premises sight unseen. When I asked to speak with the director, he said my disability wasn't visible and therefore the dog was fake. I asked for clarification  because the website clearly states that service dogs are allowed. I also asked him to describe what constitutes a real dog and how he identifies one. He was unable to give me an answer. I was with a student field trip attending a private appointment. Wow!</text><user_name>Jodi Frazey</user_name></record>

Beautiful way to see woodworking done by a true craftsman. Very informative 90 minute tour given by Susan the day we were there. Reservations needed for tours which you really want to take. 15.00/12.00 for seniors. Check website for children info. We were lucky to get in the day we called. Beautiful grounds.</Review>

< Review>
I had visited Sam Maloof before the whole complex of buildings was moved from where the 210 freeway cuts through. He had said at that time every stick and rock had to be moved by Cal Trans because the 210 was cutting through it. So here we are many years later.

The visit today was free except for the house tour which was $5 but it ended at 3.00 pm and I missed it. Anyway the garden, gallery and gift shop was very pleasant and they had a lot of sculptures on display in the garden for today only. There many events occurring throughout the year so check back on their web site and plan your trip accordingly.<//Review>

<review>Awesome tour. This place has such a feel of comfort and home. Absolutely beautiful woodworking, art, ceramic, sculptures. Lovely plant and sculpture garden. Great museum and gift shop. Very good video before tour. No photographing inside. Reservations a must. Present COVID protocol. A MUST SEE!< /review>< pictures>

<review>I had a crown placed with the help of this high end dental crown machine the dentist used and less than a year later the crown came off. I went back for a repair which I was told would be done at no cost but sure thing I was charged $75 for the office visit (I have PPO) to later find out I should have never been charged. A few months later, the same crown has chipped. Time for a new dentist. High-tech gear can be an advantage if you know how to use it.</review><user>102078893913792965262<//user>< Date>

<text>I was so terrified to go to dentist a couple of years ago. From the very first day, everyone made me feel so comfortable and safe. I am so happy to have found this place. Dr Mojaver is absolutely the nicest and most understanding person I greatly appreciate. Thank you to everyone!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Dr. Nasrin Mojaver and her team are a wonderful combination of compassion, knowledge, and patience.  They understand I can get very anxious and have never been a fan of going to see a dentist.  However, Dr. Mojaver and her team understand and remember this every time I go in.  They make sure I am comfortable, relaxed, and explain exactly what they will be doing and why.  She is the first dentist I have ever trusted and feel comfortable around.  Any time someone says they need to look for a new dentist, I immediately recommend her.</Text>< time>

< Review>
I want to say that Dr.Mojavar is one of the best dentists I have ever seen. She is extremely professional, knowledgeable, and very caring. I had seen other dentists but they were not good at their work. I had so much pain and I called Dr. Mojavar. She explained the whole procedure in detail so I can understand. I was able to receive the best treatment. She did an implant for me. She is awesome and I highly recommend her for any implant as well as other dental treatment. Thanks a lot, Dr. Mojavar< /Review>

I had previously gone to another dentist and wanted to get a second opinion , instantly I was able to  tell that pearl cosmetic and family dentistry was honest & also very flexible.
It was my first visit and they were able to do my Exam and also fit in a crown procedure all on the same visit .. which is unheard of in other dentist offices they even stayed an extra hour to make sure it was all done the same day .
Andrea and Viviana were super helpful & had great customer service .

Dr. Nasrin Mojaver was very efficient and professional. Definitely coming back for my routine visits .<//text>

I’ve never had a simple or easy dental experience... I’ve always struggled finding a dentist I could trust or I felt cared. Dr. Mojaver is a true professional who takes your health to heart and delivers excellent service. She takes the time to clearly communicate all the options you have, and her passion for her profession is obvious I’ve never felt for a second, her or her staff try and “upsell” me, and in fact has opted for the more affordable procedure on multiple accounts taking my budget into account. I never write reviews, but after coming here for a number of years now I felt compelled. If I could give this office more than five stars I would.< /text>

<review>Most wonderful people.  Patient with me all the the time because I gag a lot.  The New technology (equipment) is amazing in developing a crown in relatively no time compared to what it was like in years past.  I highly recommend these dentistry services for young to old.  They play great music too !</review></record>

I came to Dr. Mojaver through recommendation from Kaiser about 3 years ago when I moved here from San Francisco.  Since then she and her staff have been most kind, accommodating and painless.  Mostly routine cleaning but had a really neat experience when they discovered a cavity that required replacement of a metal cap.  They manufactured a new crown using a 3D laser printer right in their offices, and in just a few minutes.  Best part, I got to watch it being made.  Cool!<//text>

Called in a Wednesday and they were able to see me that Friday! I wanted to buy some more time for my two root canals with temp filing in them and have them re-add more temp filling until I financially able to purchase the crowns etc. Prompt service and not only followed my instructions she furthermore suggested the buildups rather than temp fillings and showed me within a few min the difference in my co-pays. I went for the buildups as it had to be done regardless and she did not spare on the materials! She is very nice and to my surprise wanted to make me happy, which is extremely rare now a days. I had been with several different dentists in this area and for the first time I walked out of a dentist office with a smile and felt great after two buildups!< /Text>

Excellent! My tooth was having a lot of pain and discomfort and Dr Mojover was gentle while fixing the filling on my front tooth which is a relatively sensitive area and she did not use a painful shot my tooth was fixed painlessly in a short time! I really appreciate your support with fixing my tooth so I can be pain free. You are a talented dental angel!  ♥️ Pontea< /text>

Stay away if you have HMO insurance. They will never treat you like a patient. Instead you feel like an intruder. They will never have an open appointment for you, because they are not making any money from you.
The worst experience ever!  I would give 0 stars if I could.< /Review>

With HMO plans, patients are assigned to a specific office monthly and  must be on our eligibility roster. This roster is updated monthly. Occasionally, patients are removed or reassigned by the plan for reasons we are not aware of. Therefore, we only schedule patients for the month they are eligible for, otherwise, if patients are not eligible, they will be responsible for the services in full. After speaking with you, I contacted your insurance company to do a three way telephone conversation and was not able to speak with any representative after one hour of being on hold. If you are able to contact your insurance and do a three way call, we are more than happy to discuss this further. I have even contacted plan's provider relations representative and left a message to discuss this matter."}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf9ed7b82ba1f:0xcacb345a85a56144<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Just had my first visit with Dr. Mojaver. The office staff were all very kind and pleasant. The office is small but has very up to date equipment - I especially loved the massage chair. Dr. Mojaver was very professional, pleasant, and treated me as a valued patient. My exam was very thorough but not overboard. Optional treatments were offered but not pushed, and all of the costs were clearly explained. I have to come back for a filling, but I'm not worried about it at all. Should be a breeze.</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Mojaver and the team at Pearl Cosmetic & Family Dentistry are amazing! I've been a patient for almost 2 years now and every visit has been top notch. Dr. Mojaver is always warm, welcoming, and attentive to any issues. Her office also has a laser for dental fillings which avoids the need for anesthesia. It made my filling quick and painless!</text>

<Review>One of the things I have always dreaded is finding a good dentist for my family, especially since one of my kids has severe anxiety when it comes to her dental check-ups.  Her previous dentist refused to even do her check-ups anymore because his concern was that he would traumatize her to where she wouldn’t even let anyone near hear.
From the first time I called Pearl Cosmetic & Family Dentistry, I got a warm and friendly greeting over the phone.   I explained the situation with my daughter and they reassured me that they’ve worked with other kids with the same fears and they can help.  From the moment I walked in the office, the same friendliness I got over the phone I felt there.  The front desk staff and hygienist were extremely nice, but Dr. Mojaver was amazing. It was the first time I saw my daughter feel so at ease at a dental appointment AND she got an excellent cleaning too.  When I brought her back to have a couple cavities taken care of, my daughter was so nervous, but again Dr. Mojaver and the hygienist both talked my daughter throughout the visit and the appointment went great!  I had my other daughter seen there too and my husband and I will also be scheduling appointment for ourselves as well.  All costs for services were explained ahead of time and I had the option of opting out if I wanted to.  There was absolutely no pressure on that end.
I highly recommend Pearl Cosmetic & Family Dentistry to everyone!<//Review>< Pics>

Dr Mojaver is a kind, friendly, and gentle dentist with amazing skills and office capabilities.  The office makes crowns in house now so no more multiple trips to complete that procedure.

Dr. Mojaver and the team at Pearl Cosmetic and Family Dentistry did an incredible job. Truly expert level craftsmanship and dedication. Using state of the art technology.

I went in for a tooth that had previously had a crown and filling. The tooth was in bad shape with a cavity and particially broken filling.

Dr. Mojaver was able to remove the deep cavity and work with the tooth to rebuild it using a 3d camera and software to precisely map out the structure of the remaining tooth. Then using a specialized 3d printer / CNC machine create a brand new crown in house. The crown was a real work of art. Made with a nice tight fit due to the skill level and use of sophisticated equioment. Without this level of skill and artistry this would not have been possible due  to the tooth's condition.

I have had various work do over the tears and I'm consistently impressed by the level of dedication and friendliness of the entire staff at Peal Cosmetic. I have seen the dentist skilll level, which was already very good, continue to grow over the years to an exceptional level. This is due to their continued use of new and improved  equipment and techniques.

Everytime I go in I'm treated very well, just like family.  I cannot recommend them enough! You will be very fortunate to have them treat you on your next appointment  whatever state your teeth are in, I would highly recommend you have the experts at Pearl Cosmetic Dentistry. give you that great smile you deserve!</text>

<text>Just returned to the best dentist ever. Crown replacement, no pain , no wait all the work in one place. Amazing. 3D CAD was so cool.
Hard to say enough good things.

My past experience with dentistry has not been a good one, but all that changed with Pearl. They are caring ensuring your comfort at all times. From the time you walk in you are greeted as a friend, and treated with respect and understanding during the whole visit, at the end they all thank you for coming in. The staff enjoy their work, laughing, joking and being friendly is just the day to day routine here. It puts you at ease and makes the experience enjoyable; there I said it, I enjoy going to this dentist.
Cheers

<review>I couldn't be happier with this dentist. I am an accommodating patient when I'm in the chair, but after having multiple bad experiences with my previous dentist, I'm not an easy patient in regard to pushy sales practices, poor quality work, and BS excuses...I am informed and know what I want and don't want. Dr.Mojaver and her staff listened to what I wanted and didn't want, and did an amazing job catering to my needs. They are professional, courteous, understanding, and did fantastic work exactly how I wanted. They made my crown rapidly in-house, the fitment was perfect, and required no follow up visits for adjustment. I highly recommend this doctor to anyone considering a new dentist. I'll amend this review if anything changes, but my first experience was the best experience I've ever had with a dentist. As an added bonus, they have chairs that gently massage your back during the procedure! A+++</review>< Pics>

Dr. Mojaver and staff are wonderful and they make you feel like family.  They all are very caring and understand that a dentist office can be scary.
This is the first dentist that once I've had a crown done I did not have to go back and have additional work done to make it fit correctly.
I have recommended Dr Mojaver to my friends.< /text>

Pearl Dentistry has the nicest, most professional and skilled providers I have ever experienced!!!  The office is a beautiful, warm environment with amazing staff.  From exams to procedures, they have the most state-of-the-art equipment!  I am very impressed! So much so that my husband and 2 children (6yo and 3yo) are also patients. I have referred any of my friends or family who have asked for a wonderful dentist to Dr. Mojaver and her top notch team of providers and office staff.< /text>

I took my 95 year old mother to Dr. Mojaver for the first time recently and everything went great.  My mother came out of the first appointment and said that she was a great dentist.  The financial and insurance stuff was all explained in a straight forward way ... no confusion.  I would recommend her to anyone.< /review>

<Response>{'time': 1576102046188, 'text': 'Thank you so much Karina'}</Response><user_name>Karina Ricasa<//user_name><review>Dr. Mojaver is very professional and knowledgable, and most importantly for me, she makes me feel at ease. I've been going to see her for years and after battling cancer needed some serious dental work done. I had a molar fall out due to bone mass loss and went to Dr. Mojaver for help. She explained to me that fixing it would require a tooth extraction, a bone graft, a crown, and a bridge because an implant was not an option.

I had not had such extensive dental work done in a long time and was very anxious when I arrived for the procedure a couple days ago. Throughout my visit, she held my hand and helped calm me down. It was a very long procedure, but I am extremely satisfied with the outcome. They were even able to use a 3-D printer to create my crown and bridge in their on-site laboratory. I will be in for a check-up in a couple weeks, and in the meantime, the doctor has already called me personally to ask how I am recovering. I highly recommend her.</review>< Pictures>

Very friendly people throughout the office. Highly recommend any and all to check them out.<//Text>

<Review>Dr Nasrin has been my dentist for last 4 years and I am very satisfied coming here for all dental issues. She and her staff really take care of me during every visit. I like that she never told me to get fancy stuff done even though other dentists in the past have told me to. Getting appointments is also easy and so is resceduling. Her office is in a good location too with no parking issues. I would always recommend her.</Review>< GmapID>

I love my dentist. Dr. Mojaver has a personal touch and remembers small details about one's life and family. More importantly, she is a knowledgeable professional and has a lot of tricks to keep pain and discomfort to a minimum. Everyone on her staff is very likeable and good at their jobs. I have to pay out of pocket for everything and she gives me a nice discount that I appreciate. The office is always impeccable, there are plenty of chairs and rarely is there a wait. And when I'm in the chair and look up, it is nice to see her face and eyes. She has a wonderful sense of humor which I prize dearly. If you are reading this to choose a dentist, go no further, you've found the right one.< /review>

Dr. Mojaver and the staff are amazing. The difference is noticeable from the moment you enter the office - it is welcoming and comfortable and it makes you forget you're at the dentist. Glenda at the front desk always has a smile on and is so helpful.
The staff as well as Dr. Mojaver are caring, friendly, professional and go above and beyond to put me at ease and make me feel comfortable because the truth is, going to the dentist is not usually a pleasant experience. Whether it's a neck pillow or headphones with some nice soothing music to make your mind wander to far far away places while they are working hard on your pearly whites, they have all the tools to make you feel as comfortable as possible. Furthermore they are very knowledgeable and take the time to answer all my questions (and I have a few). Most importantly the work they do is top notch and I'm so glad they're in my insurance network.</Text>

Our family has been going to Pearl Cosmetics for more than 5 years and we're so happy and satisfied with the service and care we get! Dr. Mojaver is an excellent dentist and very friendly with the kids. She takes the time to give us individual attention. All the staff at Pearl Cosmetics are professional & friendly. I highly recommend them as your family dentist.</Review>

<review>I have been coming to Dr. Mojaver and her team for many years.  My previous dentist(s) were closer, but I only went there when I was having issues.  I never really felt like I wanted to be there.  Consequently, when I started at Pearl, I had some periodontal problems.  Dr Mojaver worked me through those and now for many years my teeth and gums have been healthy.  Going to the dentist is no longer a stressful, painful thing.  I go for regular checkups and cleanings and they keep me on track for where I am doing well and where I might be missing areas in my daily care.  The office is a pleasant place and the staff make you feel welcome.

It's also worth noting that for many years I had very comprehensive dental coverage.  For the last year I have been retired and paying out of pocket.  Still the same great care, with fair consideration for my wallet.

I highly recommend Dr Mojaver and the staff at Pearl.</review><date>1551206793221<//date><Rate>5</Rate></record>

<text>Had a crown placed here. Originally came in a bad toothache on no notice and they were able to get me referred and scheduled for a root canal at another place right away.
I came back for a crown and very pleased with the service. Local anesthesia is always the most unpleasant step, but here I could not even feel it!
Everyone in the office is very friendly. I most certainly recommend this place.
Thank you, Dr. Mojaver!</text><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

I've been with Dr. Mojaver since she was in another dental office. I lost touch with her for a few years because I didn't care for the other staff in her old office. Luckily, I found her again and now she has her own office in Carmel mountain/sabre springs area.

The office is spacious, brightly furnished and very clean. That's a plus to the already excellent dental experience.

I highly recommended Dr. Mojaver. She is so nice and gentle but thorough.  I wouldn't want anyone else to do my cleaning for me.<//text>

Dr. Mojaver is one of the best dentists I have been to. She is very kind and caring and provides the best service ever. The staff is extremely helpful. I have been going to  Dr. Mojaver for over 15 years now and have had every type of dentistry you can imagine. They have always given me the best advice and excellent service. I have referred many friends and family members to her over the years.
If you are looking for a skillful, caring and ethical dentist, she is the dentist you should visit. I highly recommend her to everyone.< /Review>

The Pearl office is the nicest place I've been to in a while. The equipment is up to date, the atmosphere is nice, the interior is warm and inviting and the employees are considerate and on task with my dental care. I have been to many offices that try to sell me stuff I don't need, or insist on procedures that are unnecessary. At this office I received exactly what I needed for a problem molar that had been bugging me for about a year. The treatment was spot on at Pearl and the problem is gone...I wonder why I had to suffer for so long before getting the proper treatment?!?!? ALL DENTISTS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL! Thank you Dr. Mojaver, to you and your staff<//text>

I feel so lucky that I was able to find such an amazing dentist with just a simple Google search!  Dr. Mojaver and her team are so kind, friendly, and welcoming!  As a new patient (and one with a fear of needles), I was fairly nervous for my dental appointment.  However, both the staff and the doctor went out of their ways to make sure that I was not only comfortable, but relaxed and happy as well.

I kicked off my shoes and plugged in some headphones, while the dental assistant gave me an eye mask turned on the massage chair.  I have never experienced dental work (fillings) that were so pleasant! Plus, the touch-up work that Dr. Mojaver did on my teeth came out beautifully!!  I am very happy with my experience, and excited to return as well as recommend new patients!< /text>

<review>Always a pleasant visit, Dr. Mojaver, Glenda and the staff are very professional and attentive to our all needs.
We now have the whole family under Dr. Mojaver's care , so no more visits to the children only dental offices.
Making an appointment is easy and with convenient reminders, getting to the dentist is a breeze.
Highly recommended!</review></record></dataset><record>

thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Dr Nasrin’s office. I had some pretty big issues with my tooth and things got a bit complicated with it but Dr Nasrin and the team handled everything perfectly. Her office is cozy and comfortable and very enjoyable to be in. The location is great and with a super friendly and helpful team and a 5 star doctor what more could you want. It makes getting a cavity exciting :) Thank you Dr Nasrin and team!< /review>

<Review>My husband and myself have been going to Dr. Mojaver's office for a few years for our dental services and routine checks. I have been to dentist since I was kid for cavities, so I have lots of fillings.  Dr. Mojaver and her staff have always been on top of my routine checks to prevent more issues by fixing my cavities when they are small and doing x-rays periodically. Everybody in the office is very friendly and make you feel welcome. I highly recommend her business.</Review>< pictures>

Dr. Mojaver has been my dentist for the last 8 years and I have been extremely pleased with her services. She is meticulous, caring and kind. She takes the time to listen to your problems and figure out the best treatment plan. I have problems with tooth sensitivity and I really appreciate her gentle approach and genuine concern for my comfort. Dr. Mojaver and her team provide excellent customer service while maintaining an upbeat and warm, caring environment.<//Review>

My family and I have been going to dr. Mojaver for years. First my mom, then over the years she has recruited us all! She does great work and is always polite, respectful and a pleasure to have your teeth done by. Trust is very important when trying to find a good dentist. I feel that I, and my family can trust her and her team.<//Review>

Dr. Mojaver is the best dentist I have ever had, service is excellent, state of the art facilities, and best of all she takes pride in her work. I have never had to return after having work done. She has always done the job right the first time! Most of my life I hated going to the dentist but now I can't wait for my next visit. She is a true professional.

Thank you Dr. Mojaver!!</text>

Dr. Mojaver and her staff are wonderful!  I hadn't been to a dentist in years and was hesitant to try another one after my previous experience.  As soon as I walked into Dr. Mojaver's office I was greeted warmly and put at ease.  She knows exactly what she is doing and fully explains everything.  She is very affordable and does great work.  I have been going to her for a couple of years now and no longer dread going to the dentist like I used to thanks to Dr. Mojaver.  I recommend her to everyone and no one is ever disappointed!< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Dr. Mojaver and her staff at Pearl Cosmetic were nothing short of amazing when it came to taking care of my teeth.  I had come in for my initial consultation regarding a broken tooth and was out the door within 30 minutes with a full understanding of the condition of my teeth and gums - shown to me with pictures and explanations, what she and her staff could do to help me, and how much everything would cost me, should I decide to follow up with them. This was a very efficient visit with no pressure, which I extremely appreciated. I ended up going back to have that tooth extracted as well as a couple fillings placed, and again was blown away by the efficiency and care given to me by Dr. Mojaver and her staff.  My entire procedure was completed probably in about 30-45 minutes, while experience very minimal pain throughout.  I was given instructions on why they were doing what they were doing, and how I myself could help facilitate the healing process post operatively.  I highly recommend her office and her services to anyone looking for a dentist in the San Diego area.<//text>< name>

Worst, every filling fell out or rotted out from under the tooth with three years.

She will make sure she scams your insurance dry.
Just remember each tooth she touches you will loose in less then three years< /review>

<Review>I have been going to Dr. Mojaver for several years.  I had been going to the same dentist for over 15 years and he had to close his practice due to health problems.  I was afraid I wouldn't find another dentist that I felt so comfortable with.  Luckily, I found Dr. Mojaver.  Her and her staff are top notch.  They are very friendly, efficient and accommodating.  Dr. Mojaver doesn't  recommend treatment that is not necessary.  She is very open and straightforward.  I recommend Pearl Cosmetic and Family Dentistry to anyone who wants the best treatment!<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Love Dr. Mojaver and her staff! Everyone is super friendly and knowledgeable. I used to work at a dentist office when I lived up north in OC, and so I learned a great deal about dentistry and insurance...At Dr. Mojaver's office, I know I am in great hands when getting my teeth cleaned. She also did a great job replacing one of my older amalgam fillings with a composite filling when I was having some sensitivity. Highly recommend this office for any of your dental needs!<//Review>

Everytime I enter Dr. Mojaver's office, I am warmly welcomed like walking into my sister's kitchen for coffee. Their charming customer service, coupled with Dr. Mojaver's great medical expertise introduced me to the quality dental care I plan to have for the rest of my life.<//text>

I recently had invisalign and was happy with the results! There was an issue with my insurance and Dr. Mojaver worked with me to resolve the issue with patience, kindness and professionalism. The entire office is very friendly and make going to the dentist an enjoyable experience. What I really like about Pearl is that they take my insurance and do not bill extra for cleanings or X-rays. I used to go to another dentist that was great but they charged me above what my insurance allowed for a simple cleaning and Xrays. I also like that they offer teeth whitening that is very affordable and doesn't hurt or take long. Dr. Mojaver is very gentle and great with kids. My daughter doesn't dread getting her teeth examined and cleaned and looks forward to getting her goodie bag.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
After moving from Canada, I did a lot of research before finally choosing Doctor Mojaver. She and her staff are amazing! Everyone in that office is so welcoming, professional and puctual. They have never made me wait to be treated.
Having had several very negative dental experiences, I was pleasantly suprised to find that my anxiety level during my visit was almost non-existent. I immensely enjoyed my first visit to Doctor Mojaver's office. I am very pleased with the results! Dr Mojaver thank you so much!
I strongly recommend Doctor Mojaver for her excellent services!<//Review>

Went there this past Saturday and was seen immediately and treated for hives. Dr told me to come back in 3 days if they weren't getting better.  Went back today and I knew I would have a wait and I was OK with that. After 2 hrs in the exam room, a nurse popped her head in and said "you're still here?" About a half hour to 45 minutes she comes back and says "you're good to go! Dr has sent everything you need to the pharmacy and you can call Sherry in a couple days to go over your x-rays.  I said "I'm here for hives " She said you're Jill and I said yes. She left and never came back...<//Text>

They were supposed to fill my prescription on the 17th and have yet to do so. Also think it’s a little weird I’m not getting the same medicine as other COVID patients - two other people have received a steroid and amoxicillin. A Z-pack. But y’all leave me with rude customer service and a heavily delayed nasal spray? Lmao give me a break. Might as well go with Adventist if you’re in the Oakhurst area.

Edit to add: I was waiting for my COVID test, just the test, for about 40 minutes. Damn near fell asleep in the car.< /review>< Pictures>

I had an appointment at 4:45 and at 6:20 I was still waiting to see a doctor! No one even checked on me to tell me what was going on!! I will never go back! Now I have to find a new primary care physician. Not a good experience as a new resident to Oakhurst!<//review>

Not sure yet. I hate the fact that i have to have a separate appt for each issue. When i asked, they said it was about volume. That put me off. Gone are the days of total care I guess.< /text>

Dr.Barker is very nice. BUT. My boy did LAB CORP today 04/09/2020.  When the doctor drove the needle into my son's arm.He didn't get to the blood vessel right away  but twisted the needle inside his flesh until he got into the blood vessel. He should have pulled the needle back and re enter!!  I was holding my little boy and watching all the process. My poor boy.  It's swollen and he got much more wound than normal! I will never do LAB CORP again to my other boys over there.  It's terrible.</text>

<review>I have called 3 times for prescriptions to be okayed and stopped by the office twice.  Still haven't gotten approval.  This happens every time I need a prescription  okayed.  Guess I'll have to go back to Adventist Health who can't keep help very long.< /review>< Name>

Started at the office in Oakhurst. I've had an unbelievable amount of different doctors. I've always been treated well by the girls at the front and the other ones helping the doctor. I've had to wait before and even waited so long I just left. But still I go back. They know me by my first name and are so helpful. When they transferred to Coarsegold I followed and so far I am so comfortable with the doctors and the staff. I needed surgery and I got my referral right away.<//text>

once again they completely dropped the ball.
I have called  3 times you medication refills
no response no refills.  you people don't care your Dr. are  ridicules.   thank you rlfur absolutely nothing.  I have pure discontent for you thanks . you say 1 thing and practice a different, good medicine.  not one of those things. you'd probably be happy if people just died so you could have the day off

Seriously clear your day if you have appointments here. Never never get in on time always behind hour or more always some kind of excuse why they behind. Very frustrating especially for working people. Confidently is non existent, everyone in lobby knows your business.< /Review>

I went in as a new patient to the clinic they just opened in Coarsegold and saw Dr Chico. I do not recommend that anyone go to this doctor ever! She did not send in any of my prescriptions and since my visit my  ear drum has ruptured, she did not write down any thing I told her and quite frankly I think she was more worried about trying to look pretty than she was about helping me! Terrible terrible doctor!!!!< /text>

<Review>Why is this office always late in seeing their patients?  They spent more time with their niceties towards each other than getting patients treated. Then when you question the doctors they argue with you, make excuses and then tell you their issues with Camerenas management.  Ugh.

< Review>
I take my baby (under 1) to Camarena Oakhurst &I go to Camarena Coarsegold.

I'm disappointed in the reviews on here... it's the medical field, not a fine dining experience. Every case is unique in its own way... seriously &y'all wonder why doctors don't want to work in our mountain community. Anyway.... personal experiences:

The new pediatrician in Oakhurst is amazing. She has a warm heart, an open ear, and non-judgemental persona. She's on top of it when it comes to knowledge, and makes herself available outside of appointments, if need be. I'm so glad to have her here. I've only had to "wait" when I've called in same day or prior day &it wasn't even that long.

The doctor in Coarsegold is very patient.  She has personality &knowledge; I like that. The office staff seems to be a mixed of new &seasoned (I also appreciate that because we need more medical field personnel around here!) They are pleasant to be around &again the wait time is to be as expected: some days are longer than others-- maybe the people complaining about wait time should remember that when they are asked to explain why they are there. 🤣

Anywho. Camarena is a blessing to our community. Big shout out to both places. Thank you, thank you, thank you. My family appreciates you.<//Review>

Reception:11/10
CNA:11/10
Nurse Practitioner:0/10
If you have the unfortunate day in being assigned Badu, N.P. I caution you. He not only didn't offer a friendly hello or hand shake upon entering my room, but was domineering and rude when I, the patient, asked for him to go into detail about tests he said I needed or a referral that would "take a long time". Badu became impatient and dismissive when I wasn't understanding him. In theory, the medical system is supposed to aide in the help of a patient, not add to the disconnect. It's disheartening to see such a low caliber staff member on their payroll. I very, very rarely seek medical attention, and when I do I expect to be treated with respect and to be heard, not talked down to and treated as though I am some dumb person who is probably milking the system. This place misses the mark with their Nursing staff with Badu.

Food for thought: Where are the PhD's? Very Wizard of OZ to me. I must be missing something.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Im no longer a patient there as of Today  and its very upseting ive been there patient for at least 6 years watched doctors come and go watched the entire office get trained they knew me on a first name basis . I've never complained or said a rude word to anyone .
Until today I am in shock I ve been there early before my appointment time every time , always have to wait sometime I even thought they forgot about me in the back while waiting for the dr. To examine me I was in there for 2hours it was five or after when I finially came out to see if anyone was still there but that happened about a year ago.
Yet I never even complained I think it was because I liked the dr. So much.
All that stopped today as I was saying I made a 2:30 appoinment was there on time got checked in kind of even excited cuz I was going to see my dr. Whom I haven't seen for 1year and three monthes ....mind you i was in last week with I thought was beginning stage of phenoma there guy nurse or whom ever I seen said I had the flu and would not take my word for it here I amback the following week but 10x worse .
As I'm waiting and waiting seeing people  come in getting called back before me knowing there appointment time was after mine (cuz over heard there appointment times ) Then I go and ask
Why are all these people getting called back before me beings I was there first the office lady goes oh Brenda I'm so sorry ?? Not knowing really what was going on I sit back down then two more people for called back with no explaination of any kind I stood up said this is not right . And walked outside to cool off called the main office in Madera only to be told my appointment now had been cancelled this is how a patient is treated cuz of there stupid mess .

I wouldn't take my enemy there .
And i am a very resonable person had the office lady said oh Brenda I'm sorry i messed up and put in the back of the line I made a mistake I would have not liked it but I could have excepted it . Instead they did this whole cover-up this that is totally unexceptable  people make mistakes company's should not cover up stupid .
This could have been deadly if it were my medicine and not my appointment time come on camerena you people are fake and not small town friendly .

I believe the staff to be very attentive to my my needs and I feel very safe in there care. And there kindness is so welcoming with with a very clean and friendly  admisfear . I found that its hard for me to go to a doctor in the past cause of my experience with staff members. But not at camarena health in Oakhurst ca. They make feel welcomed in a careing loving friendly way that is most reassuring when they find the problem and get it resolved fast. They are very knowledge in the medical center and are intuitive efficient and I am so thankful for them being in Oakhurst where it is hard to get to Fresno for a doctor.< /text>

<Text>I always show up early for my appointment and I have to wait over an hour to be seen! They're also very rude to children and got upset that my son was loud in the waiting room. He must have gotten tired of waiting too. They can't stick to their own schedule and the help seems more concerned with their phones.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place, is THE place!

Since opening day they’ve put out the best Thai food I’ve had anywhere! I love the passion and clean tastes and textures these people put into their food! I now live 10 minutes from Portland Oregon where good Thai food is abundant, BUT...  Bangkok Avenue is still my favorite Thai restaurant. I look forward to a meal here whenever I come down to SoCal. Every dish I’ve had so far has been delicious, and I’ve had a good majority of the menu! Crab Cream Puffs and Fresh Rolls? I love em’! Tom Kha or Yum I get every time. Ginger Ginger and Veggie Delight ordered Spicy are also favorites. I’m currently craving the Seafood Panang.

I wish you the best of luck for many years to come Bangkok Avenue!<//Review>

<text>This last takeout my sister ordered the pineapple fried rice which was delicious considering I am not a fan of pineapples (especially on pizza).  Sa-te chicken and crab cream puffs make a good appetizer combination.  They are always so nice, friendly and welcoming each time we picked up our orders, we can't wait to dine in.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I am a huge Thai food fan, and every Thai restaurant I get the panang Curry. The food was fresh and cooked well, and I would give them a 5 star but there was huge Bay leaves left in the curry. The staff is wonderful and attentive, the place is very clean, and their to go orders are well wrapped. I will come here again to see if I can edit and give them 5 stars. The price is a dollar or two more then expected, but it is thousand oaks.< /text>

<Text>Great tai food.  Dishes are well prepared and have great flavor.  Make sure to make reservations on Friday and Saturday nights or plan on waiting for a bit.  Check the board for special dishes.  They have great soups and the dumplings are fantastic.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80e8253b092a54d5:0xb2dbc011c08fe6c0</gmap_id>< rating>

Fresh roll were good. The rice wrappers were quite sticky. Taste wise no issues for the rolls. Peanut sauce perfectly complements the roll. We also asked for spicy sauce. It is recommended dish if you go for this place. Basil fried rice with deep fried egg was good. Fried rice was not spicy. We asked for medium spice level. If you prefer then you can ask for higher spicy level based on your taste. Fried egg was good but it wasn't seasoned well.< /text>

Drinks were relatively inexpensive and well made. The fresh bread was wonderful. Bone marrow appetizer has caramelized onions and bacon. Filet was cooked to perfection. Shrimp and scallop linguini was a bit spicy and delicious. Added the crab leg and it was definitely worth it. Highly recommended and we’ll be back.< /Text>< Time>

I was visiting for business and stopped in for lunch. The service was good and quick. I ordered the Crab fried rice. The fried rice actually contained a decent amount of crab which was a pleasant surprise. The portion was large (unfortunately I could not take with me as I had no way to safely store). I also tried the coconut ice cream and sticky rice. It was really good too. I was stuffed full and happy.</text>

<review>The food is consistently incredible. I have been back many times. The flavors are absolutely amazing. The owner is super nice and friendly and some how seems to remember everyone’s orders , even though she never writes anything down, and remembers it next time you come in. Great staff, great food, and very clean. The best Thai food around period.</review>< Pictures>

This small Thai restaurant has five star quality food. And a great wine list of hand selected wines that go very well with the food. Gotta try the scallops and eggplant. Everything we had there was amazing but that dish was magical.<//review>

<Text>The first thing we noticed when we walked in was a clean, well-updated restaurant...oh and the waitress's smiling face. We were very happy to know that they can make our favorite dishes vegan style and delicious. Peach, the waitress, is very knowledgeable when it comes to dietary specifications like "Vegan" and happily suggests modifications. My friend and I go here almost every week and after just a few visits Peach already knew our orders and modifications by heart. She is such a wonderful example of excellent customer service. On top of the fantastic service, the food is absolutely delicious. It's consistently amazing and the portions are enough to fill me up (although not enough for leftovers). We love this place!< /Text>< pics>

All the classics are done well, but also the desserts. I cant believe we never tried them before but I'm glad we did finally. My goodness. Very creative.< /Review>

<Review>Amazing, consistent, and flavorful Thai dishes. THE best Thai restaurant in Thousand Oaks, with great service. ALWAYS very busy, so be patient with your carry out orders, and dine-in orders. Favorites: Green curry seafood stew (no noodles). It's not on the menu (first saw it mentioned on Yelp). A LOT of seafood - 2 meals worth!  Spring rolls are great, along with Tom Yum Gai soup (chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, lemon). Perfect with brown rice. Family owned business, mostly young gals. Great job ladies!< /Review>< rating>

I walked in 25 min before closing when the sign said open on a Saturday night. The workers there acted like they didn’t want to serve me. One of them go and ask the kitchen then approached me telling me I can’t dine in I only can take away. We I was leaving an older couple walks in and they seat them. They blow my kind away for the pick and chose service they have and then they ask me if I still want to eat. What a very bad representation for the restaurant. When you have such unwelcoming people who work there. The owner should pay attention to this behavior. Change your hours online and turn off you open sign if you don’t want to receive customers anymore. No stars indeed</review>

First time there ...great food, fast service and easy to have a conversation without needing to yell!, even with an almost packed full restaurant. Another good thing waitress was very attentive, so things got brought out as needed not rushed at all. Definitely will return.< /Review>

<Text>I don't like giving bad reviews, but so many reviews were raving about this place, I left disappointed. The fried bananas were wrapped in spring roll pastry, which I have never seen before. Sadly, it did not make the dish any better.
But the food was fresh and mostly tasty, just not quite full of the Thai flavors I expect from good Thai food.<//Text>< Response>

<Text>This is a new restaurant that opened few weeks back. The food was one of the best. We ordered Thai Garden Salad with House Made Peanut Dressing, Green Curry with White Rice and Drunken Noodles. They are very knowledgeable about food preferences for vegetarians. As a vegetarian, they made sure that the dishes we ordered were without animal products such as oyster or fish sauce. The wait staff (Peach and her sister) are excellent and very welcoming of customers coming and trying there new restaurant. They gave us 15% discount on our bill and gave us two Thai Ice Tea for free. We would definitely be back at this restaurant soon.<//Text>< pictures>

I usually don't eat oriental food often, but this place is really great. You have to try their duck dish, it is out of this world. I also found that their chicken wings were pretty good, not the best out there, but for the price you can't go wrong. Definitely worth giving this place a try.</text>

It was 10.00 and came with a soup to start with . Soup was delicious.  Then our plate was served,  salad was nice and fresh the wonton was tasty! (Extra start for being vegetarian) great service.

We had to sit at the bar bcus the restaurant was packed. AND tables had been reserved so maybe call ahead :)<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Delicious dishes of duck, chicken wings and shrimp that are the right mix of tender and crispy. Their tom yum soup is pleasantly sour and refreshing. If you enjoy spicy food, ask for the spice tray to accentuate your dishes!<//Review>

Went Saturday night. Had a reservation. For 7, didn't get seated until 7:20. There was no air-conditioning in the restaurant, I was sweating the whole time. The food was good. Pineapple friend rice with chicken. Pretty expensive, $17 and change.<//Review>

Though we didn't get to have lunch where we wanted, this was a good substitute. I'd been wanting my husband to try it for so long and of course he loved it! We both got truffle burgers and we shared a side of truffle fries.< /Review>

Excellent quality and great flavor.  The garlic spare ribs are tremendous.  I like the panang curry, spicy basil, and spicy eggplant also.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>honestly the best thai restaurant in Huntington Beach. I've JUST tried this for the first time. I was hesitant to try because I've been going to other Thai restaurants in HB for a few years as a regular, but I won't name any out of respect. Some of the Thai restaurants here in HB are incredible, but Bangkok Avenue has more of an edge.

I ordered the Short Rib Panang Curry, it was delicious. My husband and I both shared this, and we also shared the Crying Tiger. We both could not decide which one we wanted so we just shared! The Crying Tiger had tender steak with delicious sauces to dip in, I could not be any more happy with my order.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Highlands center is a  great  place  to  stop to stock up on some food and drinks at the grocery  store.  Or stop by the pharmacy. There's  plenty  of parking  available  for  all. The people  here are very friendly  and  the prices are reasonable. If  you get the chance stop by and enjoy.< /Review><Time>1584686224724< /Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>103524066118409307693< /UserId.><Name>YLesaMarie</Name>< gmapID>

<Review>The place has a laundromat in addition to a couple of Mexican restaurants, a Children's Museum, a t-shirt printing shop, and I believe a souvenir boutique.  All in all, I find it safe and pretty well maintained.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80838a2a0b7fcd1d:0xbb1707bc97a454c9</gmap_id></record>

It is some what ok....i dont like to see the homeless standing around the doors and begging for a dollar. It tookme alot to get here i think to myself. I just kindly say soor not today. It is not fair for all of us. I dont like when they follow and get mad if you dont help. So i say this. The complex needs to hire security guards for the whole parking lot. It will help on so many levels.</Text>

<Review>Fun place for kids!!!
Even though online it was showing sold out, they were selling tickets on the window as well. So who don't have tickets and want to try then can go and buy tickets upfront. It's big zoo and we'll maintained during Covid. Zoo team sanitises everything very frequently. It gets very crowded after 1-2 pm so it is better to go early and finish by 3 pm.</Review><response>{'time': 1620156146963, 'text': 'We want to clarify that buying tickets in person is not a guarantee every day. We still ask that guests make a reservation in advance.'}</response>< rating>

Came here last weekend on a Sunday for our schedule visit at 2:30pm. My boyfriend and I booked our tickets two weeks in advance for $24 each per adult and $10 for parking. Recommend to book ahead of time for your time slot, which allows you up to 30 minutes to enter, meaning from 2:30-3pm is our entry time. The lines were short and ample parking for visitors. Most animals were out and about but the reptiles and bugs building was closed and play structures are closed off from kids due to covid protocols. There’s a free gondola to take to see more animals at the top and the lines went by fast. Reason why gave one star less is because of the cleaning and sanitizing they are doing at the zoo. I felt that the way the gondolas were being sanitized could be better. They are sanitizing by just a quick spray of disinfectant into the gondola vs spraying the seats and wiping down spots that may be touched. People are getting hand sanitized before they enter but I also saw a few families slip by without doing so. I personally would feel more safe with them being more strict on their workers to follow and clean when not everyone has had their chance at receiving the vaccine yet. However, this zoo is worth checking out if you haven’t before. Not a whole lot of animals to see compared to other zoos but the gondola seems like an attraction to many that’s different from other Bay Area zoos.</text>

I like this place. But.. Theirs a lot of places that doesn't have animals in

some areas.  Because. Of. COVID-19.  i have a daughter and she wanted to eat there but. I couldn't because i barely have money because i paid to go to the  Zoo so no..  But the animals we're good. 👍  and it cost 16.00 to go in with my wife and daughter. If your child is 2 then you'll get it for free. if you are an adult than you ever get less money pay and if You have children then you pay 16.00. 0k bye!</review>

Fun zoo for all! Perfect for kids. The zoo itself is located up in the Oakland Hills, giving it a very unique backdrop. If you have a membership to another zoo, you can get discounted tickets at 50% off and free parking (parking normally $10). Check to see if your zoo is listed on the "Reciprocal list" to qualify for this discount, although the only way to purchase these discounted tickets is in person. The zoo hasn't built this into their online reservation system. For all others, if visiting during COVID, you'll need to reserve tickets online. Many cool animals, a freaking gondola ride 😃 and probably the best zoo food options I've seen. The food although expensive, was fresh and tasty. They serve beer!! Zoo is the perfect size, not too big, not too small. I think they also have a carousel and train ride, which were closed because of COVID. The gondola ride was a highlight and comes with the price of admission. You could ride it as many times as you want and the views are awesome. Food court and more animals are located at the top of the gondola ride<//review>

Wonderful bay area zoo in the Oakland Hills. The  kids love the gondola ride and the cafe is good! Lots of spots to do a mini picnic. Be prepared for lots of walking and slight hiking up some hills.<//review>

Great zoo, feels more up and close than San Diego but it's a little older.< /review>

I haven't been to this zoo in many years and I was shocked to see how awesome and beautiful it has become. The new gondola and upper area of the Zoo was an amazing update. The animals have so much space to roam around and the overlook of the cities makes you feel like you are on top of the world. The online ticket purchase was super easy and the crowd was definitely perfect for a Wednesday afternoon. I'm sure it sells out on the weekend. Definitely wear good comfy walking shoes as the hilly terrain is rough for some. I definitely forgot how hilly this place was. Lol. But it's not a huge place so it doesnt feel overwhelming and like you have to rush to see it all. Its perfect!</text>

We love this zoo. It's clean, well set up for social distancing (important in this moment in time), and provides new learning opportunities for our family. I love that we see young and old alike each time we go. It's a great place to walk around and has many benches to sit on along the way.<//text>

<Text>An absolute lovely place to go sight seeing and lounge around. Walked around at about 6pm to 9pm, looking at the theatrical display of wildlife in the form of lighted lanterns. It was like walking through a Christmas wonderland presentation.</Text>< Date>

<review>Glofari was amazing. Words can't describe. Kids had a blast. Light statues were pure art. So well put together. Felt safe also, everyone had to wear a mask.< /review><userid>106885770588023970268</userid><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg8dKNOXvjah_FiLCoipQ2F40SUvaGz1d7b7eD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5xKIZaJjkMy6lI7LUvqy8pQcgFgGeqdC2XG_T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOlvMkU9eC4P1HXteWKMKHtw_VnlHFqZDx4FKI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3c_Gzw_fzFv2xMmb-ZnDbCzmCt3oqEqAwV7F7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp_omGuZjXj6b1owuPqV4UEOQg0ZqI2rCDICiZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLVQqicRXZDsa-NsNoaIFWy11i8zBKLH2p0sm2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< rating>

It's a small zoo, but very well put together.  Be prepared to go up and down some stairs/ramps to get to exhibits.  We had a great family experience here.< /text>

Great time! Awesome to walk around. Food available. Try to get an early RSVP, 2 weeks in advance for weekends. Weekday's schedule are usually open depending on the day. Don't just drive there, pay for everything online including parking pass. Make sure to at least have the ticket barcodes from email pdf available on phone to enter park. Had a blast! Snack shop has hot food & drinks but hot food don't last all day; they ran out by 3pm. But everything else was great! We got food, walked around with mask on, and of course 6 ft social distancing. Employees will create lines if too many people are wanting to view the same animal to prevent overcrowding 1 area. Staff was excellent!</review>

<text>Glowfari is amazing!! So much fun for all ages! Not too busy, very well controlled. The giant lanterns are beautiful! The gondola ride is the best. I love that you can ride the gondola as many times as you want, included in the admission price. Café offered a variety of prepared snacks, not overly priced. The music and lights pared with the lanterns is very well done. Absolutely loved out even there.<//text>< Pictures>

Our family really enjoyed the Glowrati event! There was just the right amount of people. The flow of the lines and the atmosphere was relaxing. Food & concessions were open for purchase, however we brought our own snacks. The weather was amazing and not that chilly the evening of 11/28. You can enter within an hour of your reservation time on your tickets and you can stay as long as you want until closing at 10 pm. The earlier, the better I think. Parking was easy because of it and we got the first space in front of the entrance, which never happens. Everybody was wearing masks even though we were outside. The gondola ride up the hill was open and you can fit a double back-to-back stroller inside, not sure about the tandem. Super convenient because we didn't have to take the kids out. We have the Contour. It was a great little family outing for the Thanksgiving weekend. There were bubbles and a big floor piano for the kiddos to stomp on along with music, however for those who are strict about the social distancing among kids, probably best to divert to a different location.<//Review>

What a wonderful place to visit with family/kids. Well, any animal lover will enjoy it greatly. Big number of animals to see, learn about their habitat and discover something new. Making reservations online was easy. Staff on site is very helpful. Everything is clean, COVID- safe, everyone is masked and distancing. Stroller friendly.
Some areas are closed but that’s perfectly understandable. Gondola was a lot of fun. Separate are with California native animals was a blast to see. We hope to come back soon!<//Review>

Our family membership is well worth it so far. We were able to get up close views on many of the animals doing what they do. Our 3 year old son had a blast too.< /Text>

A nice zoo for kids and the family. Right now you book a time/date in advance and the spots do fill up so you'll want to plan ahead. We went in the afternoon and many animals were active. There were lots of staff on site to answer questions and keep things moving. Most people respected wearing a mask and social distancing. There were some spots that got a bit crowded but you could always find space.</text>

A gem, right here in the East Bay.
We've been members for years and still enjoy the place.
The newest section on California wildlife is well done.
The food in the restaurant is very good and the view from the patio are world class.< /Review>

Oakland Zoo strives to have leading quality care for our animals and provide them with the best living situations possible.\n\nThe habitats below (giraffes, tigers, and others) are in our plans for renovation within the coming years.\n\nFor example, our current chimpanzee habitat was built in the early ’90s but the Animal Care Staff has provided many changes to their environment to provide physical and mental stimulation. The climbing structures, for example, are ways for the chimpanzees to be more engaged with their environment.  We are currently assessing how to increase the behavioral diversity of our enrichment program as well as looking at ways to increase the amount of time the chimps are occupied with elements in their environment.\n\nI’m happy to hear how much you loved the California Trail and hope you come back again soon to visit the zoo.'}< /resp>

The animals at the bottom part of the zoo look extremely cracked out and stressed. They are in enclosures that look way too small. They feel like show ponies, it's really sad. The gondola is fabulous, the animals look happy and have tons of space. I wish there was some way they could expand the zoo to give the animals more space to run free particularly in the bottom part.<//Text>

Overrall great experience. This zoo has some great habitats for the animals compared to other zoos. The ride up to the second part of zoo is pretty darn breathtaking. Will definitely be taking the whole family soon.< /Text>

The gondola made this zoo experience stand out from others. There are a good variety of animals; this zoo and the neighboring San Francisco zoo each have animals that are not available in the other, so it makes both zoos worthwhile to visit. The animal decorations throughout the zoo are slightly tacky compared to the overall vibe of the zoo, but my understanding is that it is for some nighttime attraction, so I understand its necessity.< /text>

This is by far the best zoo within hundreds of miles. Way better than the dilapidated SF Zoo. The zoo is kept clean. The exhibits are well kept. The animals appear to be well taken care of. Lots to do and will take about 3-4 hours to do and see everything with a food break. I highly recommend this zoo! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</review>

Awesome zoo and so glad to return.  The staff are doing a great job with timed entry and sanitization procedures. Most in attendance were respecting social distancing with a few exceptions here and there. The gondolas were open as was the outdoor cafe with plenty of outdoor and socially distanced seating. Thanks Oakland Zoo for doing your best to make this a safe return for everyone!<//Review>

Been a member since before my kids were born. I live that it is by reservation only. Go later in day to avoid crowds. When my family goes we pretty much have the zoo to ourselves. We are looking forward to the rides opening again.</text>

My family has maintained a membership since 2016 and it has been worth every penny.  We attended Boo @ the Zoo this year. Even with the pandemic restrictions my 4 year old had a GREAT time visiting his favorite habitats while in costume.  It was a great replacement for trick or treating this year.  He was particularly excited to have his first wolf sighting.  The zoo always provides at least a couple of hours of distraction for our family.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMS_GUR7ewoNhNUrWkN5NYmMV0fZbbPzmiLzQmB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrtsj7-mVR5PfRklo8WlAzO3atvylouB_LOTio=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUtgnxLYWW4x9bJzN82HDccNvy9Y8wMpqAVR3T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7d_XZK0kecgOS3xmj_HuPmYKpZZU54Gozv4cq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNe5lyMfChxXk6V4CpHeZYZgoFc62T83QkRAazo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

Nice paved walkways.  The gondola  is a popular part of the park. You get a great view from there. You can see Oakland,San Francisco  and the bay. Best view from up top is the Bison area. Would recommend.<//review>

Always a great time at this zoo. Lots to do and see. Riding the gondola is always a favorite with some of my kids. Some are terrified of it. So I wish there was a way to get to the other side of the zoo aside from the gondola</Text>

Simple reservation system, you can pay for parking at the window in case you didn't pay ahead, parking is sparse, make sure to have your reservation at the entrance gate. some areas are closed currently.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Glowfari was so much fun! The Oakland Zoo really did a great job of putting on a great show. It was socially distanced and as safe as you could possibly make it with a bunch of families and kids. We will definitely go back when they do this again.< /Review>< Pics>

Lovely, neat and clean ambience. Stroller available on rent for kids. Food, water  and drink available. During pandemic you can take your own foods and staff are helpful and try to maintain social distancing.  Few sections are closed</Text>

<Review>We spent about four hours there, and not everything is available during this pandemic. Thankfully I bought membership and can take my family back once the other area's are open. Staff was helpful and sanitary. The gondola was amazing, the bears and monkeys put on a good show just playing around. And there is plenty for small children to enjoy. The gift shop was disappointing with a very small selection that caters to small children.</Review>< pictures>

It’s a spacious zoo with a wide variety of animals, and the kids love the gondola ride. But the food options are appalling. Given the park is catered to kids, and lengthy walking distances, it was nice to see they had dining facilities. But they serve absolute garbage, sugar filled junk food - that is remotely nutritious for a child.< /text>

The zoo layout is good but when I went, there weren't many animals out to see. There also aren't a ton of bathrooms or rest areas. I did like the feel of the animal enclosures though. They felt open and natural for the animals to enjoy.< /Text>

I am 51 years old and can honestly say this trip to the zoo was my favorite. The animals were so Interactive it's insane. I watched a baboon put a blanket on its head about five times to make me laugh then the last time he did it I asked my boyfriend if he thought he could see where he was going and no sooner did I do that did the monkey run right into a pole. He sat down took the blanket off his head and shook his head like it knocked the wind out of him. I about died. Everything was amazing at the Zoo today and what's all going on in the world it was greatly appreciated. A must-see Zoo if you're ever in the Oakland area or surrounding area.< /Review>

The zoo inside is good for families. Some animals, like tiger and jaguar are always sleeping. Bears are always fighting with each other. Not many people are visiting the zoo in the covid19 situation. But the only concern from us is that the zoo is located in Oakland, which is not a safe place for families to drive through.</Review>

It's a lovely zoo, not too huge, but a good variety of animals in pretty nice enclosures. I like the new California area that you take a gondola to.< /Review>

I went at night for the Glofari light show in December and it was spectacular. I felt like a little kid seeing lights at every corner. Highly recommend for families or adults.<//Review>

<Review>Great way to spend half a day or more with the family! You can definitely go through the entire zoo at a leisurely pace and finish within 4 hours. Be sure to reserve tickets in advance online due to their Covid policies. We unfortunately missed out on the Glofari tickets but hopefully we will catch it next time!< /Review>< Rating>

< Review>
First time visiting the zoo with my family and I enjoyed it. I went on the weekend, it was crowded so it was quite hard to practice social distancing. However, noted that everyone wore mask and not all areas were crowded. Overall, it was a very fun experience.</Review>

Oakland zoo was great on a weekday and not too crowded when we arrived at 10am! The gondola is a great addition to the zoo!! Plenty of room to spread out in the great outdoors and enjoy the animals!!< /text>

Fantastic for kids, our 3 y/o goes frequently and she never seems to tire of it. You can find all the animals and attractions online. The gondola (free) offers fantastic views of the SF Bay, as does the upper landing. Although some attractions are currently closed (thanks 'rona), like chimps, mountain lions (vulnerable to covid) and indoor spots with tight quarters (reptiles, insects), and petting zoo, there are still plenty of things to see.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I love seeing all of the animals at the zoo and my personal favorite thing to do here at this zoo is ride the 4 minute gondola 🚡 ride my only thing is that I wish it was at least a 10min or more ride throughout the entire 🏞️ park but I'm overall pleased with my hometown zoo.<//review>

Glofari introduced our family to Oakland Zoo. I was skeptical that lights in a zoo would have much to offer. Boy was I wrong! My kids lept and laughed their way through the entire lit animal fantasy. The gondola proved a challenge to their bravery which led to a level of happiness rarely seen in them. We went all out at the Landing Cafe with hot cocoa, cotton candy and popcorn all the while reveling in the nighttime view of San Francisco, the Oakland Hills, the neon running gondola and dinosaurs.<//Text>

Visited in Aug 2020 a few weeks after reopening. Purchased timed-entry tickets and parking online ahead of our visit, as currently required. Went with a senior, who appreciated the many benches for resting on. Pleasant employees. Employees and visitors followed the mask requirement. This was our first visit using the gondola to the California Trail loop. Beautiful addition to the zoo! Great to see local animals as well as ones from around the world. Some of the "welcome back" messages on whiteboards throughout the park named individual animals; I would love to have that information posted more permanently for the larger/older/easy to identify animals. Some areas of the zoo are currently closed (amusement park, petting zoo), so check the website if you have a particular destination in mind.< /text>

<Review>I like the Zoo.  It is great place to run the kiddos around and burn some energy.  We love the elephant, and giraffes exhibits. My kids wish you could see the Lions more easily though. All in all good place to spend a few hours.</Review>< Time>

Lovely zoo for single visitors, couples and families with kids. I secured 11am tickets and was able to watch an amazing feeding of the zoo's huge tortoises and saw the grizzly bears enjoying some adorable pool time. Bring plenty of cool water, sunscreen and snacks.</text>

Love this zoo !!!! Our family has had our membership for several years. We love everything about it. It's a great go to family activity for us. The zoo is well kept and the staff is very friendly and attentive. We'll be members as long as we live close enough. Highly recommend for one time visitors and memberships alike.</review>

The Lion pumpkin patch was pretty funny last week. The gondola ride up to the new California Trail section is really well done. We saw mountain lions & bears there. There were fewer people there which made the visit pleasant.</text>

<Review>We bought a membership so my son can regularly visit here every week. He absolutely LOVES it and it is teaching him SO much about all the different animals. This place has changed so much, even in just the past few years. This is easily the best zoo in the Bay Area! It's so much bigger and nicer now. All of the animal habitats are spacious and the animals themselves seem healthier and happier. I look forward to visiting here with my family more often now.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>The new Oakland zoo Wild California exhibit, accessible only by a gondola ride up the hill, is a fantastic new addition to an already family famous destination. Even our teenagers found the new exhibit to be an interesting and enjoyable visit. On weekends the zoo can be really busy, so get their early, or late to enjoy the exhibits without a lot of crowds.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Beautiful zoo with an excellent assortment of animals that are very obviously well taken care of! The ride up to California Trail offers spectacular views and even more cool animals. This zoo is great for people of any age and isn't too expensive. Staff all seem to love working there and are knowledgeable and helpful. Definitely recommend spending a day here!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Massive property. Great attention to detail throughout the property. Spent about 2 hours there but could have easily been there twice as long taking in all the small but significant touches that went into making this place special. The gondola ride provides one of the best views of the East Bay.<//Review>

<review>Tickets there are a little bit expansive.
There are a lot of shady place to stay and observe animals which is really nice for summer weather.
Animals seems like happy and healthy.
Gondola is on my recommendation list.
It is so clean and stable.
We have a very good time with our friends there.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhkV37wvWq0RddG7ufd71RHTda1vfpGphdSurb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhGrpjhk_KcXJ6Dv4HVZtpjJD5MFjci80PmTVa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxEqZ7NK7sQEZ571DAA6eJNaps_HtPXpUsMf1C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1562174724021, 'text': 'Thanks vivian!'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The Animals are always great and the sky tram has some fantastic views. The food is school lunch quality however and there seems to be garbage everywhere. Great if you love the zoo but given the choice I would go to the SF zoo.< /review>

Although several areas were still closed where social distancing is not possible, we were still able to enjoy nearly all of the zoo. Staff were plentiful, friendly, and knowledgeable. Habitats looked so nice I could live there. And the burger and fries at the cafe were awesome. The hills can be a bit steep for mobility challenged patrons, but there are plenty of benches and lots of shade to rest a bit. The animals looked happy and healthy with many enrichment activities and areas for them.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Great weekend activity and affordable entry tickets.  ($24 adult/$20 child).  Highlight of the park was the Gondola up to the hill with a cafe overlooked bay area.  Cafe food is decently priced with salad, sandwiches, pizza, burgers and fries.  A bit of hill to walk so bring water to hydrate.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_c_1j6gzPqDF_g46owzXL2aZP_YV5L4NCNEal=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNalhN3I4TvJXot_QraWUmoCFW2esRcao4r2KoT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO62sMDY5lJH64Hel_uQRjp8J9SOdnekmfX-xIW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbF6pdNlX_mUIpVsWxAs6-INItBs9KdbxCTtR3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV3q-67Ag195Ik38xquYCPw0hNOFfJmOHHP-mG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyp1Fe7NELyGi0RWIsSAJtdEj2iJpGOr1aflnW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCJaBeexXM3Ei3fp1TirSXAt_ilXygJiAAKuao=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODrfTuBMmEOF60D-C9rxQTD4AxID1k8SHFBzOl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZL23q3i5dtwPdgFDDWasGZbDTpkzfkLvSD2II=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1563818687708, 'text': 'Thanks for the review'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa</Gmap_id></record>

Great opportunity to get out of the house and into the outdoors and do something the whole family enjoys. Love the addition of the gondolas and the California trail. The Grizzlies were especially fun to watch. We also were able to see the lions get a snack.< /text>

Great place to visit...Best for kids..All day fun..The visiting fee was 24 dollars per person..So many species of animals are there.. Their is a show where at the end of the show u can touch animals which was fun.. I touched Python...Food is good.. Their are three adventure rides one is gondola ride which will be free if you buy admission tickets of 24 dollars.. second one is another trip which is of 6 dollars which is little boring good for kids and the third one is on train where u have to buy 2 tickets per person in this trip we will see Australian species..It is full on fun... Restrooms are available..We have to stand in queues for all the adventure trips.. The zoo will closes at 5...< /text>

<Review>By far my favorite ZOO, staff is amazing , lot’s of parking spaces. There is so much to experience, only negative thing I can say is I wish there was more food options and more bathroom locations. I recommend for everyone to visit if they can. Entrance fee together with the parking is very reasonable.</Review>< rate>

It was ok being that you could only see most of the big animals and ride one of the trams. Every thing else was closed off due to C-19.</Review>

<review>Great place to take the kids. Food and drinks are expensive so bring your own bag. The gondola was a fun short ride. They also have some kid rides. The California trail was amazing great views of Oakland the Bay bridge and San Francisco. You can spend the whole day there and it is worth it!!!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPixltZURcJHFyPkpOimpXujXGufyss_CIwmBae=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3bQAvKwxpiehk9Wrj5mUvaS4qKwrCF5NwZGo7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoBlV4bR1zrImGbF6w3bIVRr7ad02-1vGwRD94=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXH72Owpf_A_EnE7T5GM3CqqhkZ88tAIb7hCKN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0waQff6XbV4t5MLlRLrrXS-h1k4Vf5s76f-wJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNK9kiSBGdCnUt7zA2LnOzPRY_Y718K11Nk7KaL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwxUPV48HzvU6evWTzdpv5i74dGtkS94i8VQkP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>We had a great time. It was great for our older kids but for our preschool age kids not so much. All the play areas and  petting zoo were all closed.  Water fountains all turned off and only the stores open at the entrance. Bring your own beverages or buy it when you first get there because all the usual eating spots are closed. Everything else was closed. Was not worth the entrance fee when everything for the kids is off limits. The time limit also has you feeling rushed. Gives you barely enough time to get around the whole zoo. With little ones it a little harder. The ride up the mountain was amazing. We all enjoyed it and loved all the animals up there. Again, wish the play areas were open and water fountains. But with Covid it all has to be closed. I just don’t think it was worth the $120 we paid to get in when all the kids stuff were closed off. Especially petting zoo.<//Text>< pictures>

<rating>4< /rating><review>The zoo is small and we have spent a leisurely stroll in two hours. There are places in the park where food is sold, but you can also bring your own food picnic. Most of the zoo is located on the hillside. There are two entrances, one is higher on the hillside and the other is lower. The lower entrance is easier to drive downhill and it is very easy to see the intersection.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-pW3SkRQQjb27gtqMmU0p1IF7_7IKBFupWPtz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2zjJQctGP9QMH9nF_9GhadSTt0N2bj23EyyPK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNijdtHAAxfoxUAbeDYyXLfIaKYUDRrAo5-3aJU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyfF_vSdYbwEne40O9L9t_zKamzBJuv0tvk2_Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNOG-FNEyv39RQnZ985H5v2E1wFaJvpWYNf9gZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdB9RXnEJo_oA6YUeluKHi2updynej9N3jrT4r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1557246380102, 'text': 'Thanks for the review'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

Wonderful place for the whole family to go explore, learn, and have fun together. There is the zoo, the panoramic gondola 🚠 ride in which you can see the Bay Area (strollers and wheel chair friendly), and Adventure Landing (Kiddy amusement park for toddlers to 8 year olds).

Can easily see and experience the zoo and Adventure Landing in less than 6 hours.

#LetsGuide Tip: Be sure to ride the gondola as part of your experience, the panoramic Bay Area views are spectacular - can see all of the East Bay, Oakland Airport, San Francisco, etc.— there are bears, mountain lions, bald eagles, etc. to see, a cafeteria with self serve outdoor dining area a “multimillion dollar view,” and a zip line for kids to enjoy.

The zoo itself is hilly (many rolling hills) so if you are pushing a stroller or wheel chair it can be a workout.

Restrooms have diaper changing tables. Lots of outdoor dining areas that you can either purchase food or bring your own and eat.

Besides zoo ticket costs, parking cost is $10/car.

During the week, the place is filled with school groups and summer camp attendees besides families. There are certain areas where there can be a lot of kids in one place because of this.< /Text>

<review>My trip to the Oakland Zoo (Knowland Park) was wonderful and historic[since the 60's]. I am a long time 57 year residence. But had not been in about 4-6 years. I truly enjoyed Glowfari. It was well done and carefully thought out.. I enjoyed my family time. It was a little cold. CooWELL and Awesome<//review></record>

<Text>I added the photographs of almost all the major animals I saw except the lions. You will pretty good number of animals in the zoo. However I felt the animal enclosures ate really very small for them. When we are actually captivating them, we should atleast be sure that they get the minimum place to roam around. I honestly don’t think they gave enough space. Apart from the images added we saw grizzlies, grey wolves and a jaguar. There are about four grizzlies, one jaguar and two wolves with their four pups. It was great to see them. We were lucky enough to reach the point during their feeding time. We could see the grey wolf carry food for the pups and also saw it hiding the food at many different places. The trains ride is for kids ONLY. Sky ride is worth it coz you have good chances of siting a lion from the top during the ride. Would have been a great place if the animals were given enough room.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHla9tR0ZTeSxDc3I-dCGkDFttLiKUjHbFEuOf=w150-h150-k-no-p']},

<text>I heard from many friends that this zoo was amazing and now I know first hand. Fantastic zoo for animals that can't be in their natural habitats with room to roam. The animals have space!!! Imagine that!?! And the prices are very reasonable (even has a discount online for membership- worth every cent and includes parking).
During this pandemic unfortunately a lot of exhibits are off limits and closed for obvious reasons but we still enjoyed  ourselves immensely and plan on coming back again soon. The zoo really needs the community's support to help sustain the animals needs.

When fully reopened (hopefully in the near future) there are kid play zones and viewing areas thoughtfully placed all around the park, an awesome gondola, a train and children amusement park area.
I didn't get to try the cafe (my only complaint) the cafe up near the Buffalo and bears was closed and I was starving and munching on my kids snacks 😐.</text>< Pics>

The rate was about a bad behavior of Supervisor Bob Westfall, sleeping while interviewing me for a job.

The interview was at his office at Oakland Zoo on November 4, 2020 at 1:00 PM although he was also late for the interview.

About the Oakland Zoo, it must be a great place to visit.<//Review>

<text>What a fun experience our group had at Glowfari!
All the colorful displays were amazing.
The staff was friendly and very diligent regarding mask wearing and social distancing. Even had people walking around offering hand sanitizer.
This zoo is a great experience in and of itself.💖 Have you ever seen the views from there? Stunning.
Glowfari is just an added fun event. 😊</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This zoo has improved so much since my last visit 15 years ago.  If you haven't been in many years, I encourage you to try again.  The animals were playing and seemed happy.  The enclosures were large with vegetation and structures suited to the animals inside. Great zoo for small children.  Only downside is that there are hills so hard for elderly and pushing strollers up hills with 2 children wasn't fun.  Kids loved the gondola up to California trail.<//text>

<Review>We met up with a friend at The Oakland Zoo and we went to see the new section. The kids liked the gondola ride. It's a nice ride up with views. The new section is nice. There are animals there, they also have a new restaurant. We didn't stay long because my daughter didn't feel too well but we want to come back and enjoy it again when everyone feels better.<//Review>< Pics>

We did a walk-in.

Start your April Fool’s Day in Oakland Zoo. 🦒🦬🐆🦓🦩🦝🐫🐊🦍🐘🐢

Jun’s Tips:
1. Take a Bart and a Uber to the zoo.
2. Eat the Dipping Dots in the store (you rarely find it in supermarket; the banana split is good)
3. See the California Grizzly Bear. It’s the State bear.
4. Oversee SF and Oakland on top.
5. Eat their burger 🍔 in the canteen (the patty is moist like steamed. I like it. Not too dry or heated. )
6. Check out @christianlambertphoto for more photos of the Zoo.

Michael’s tip:
1. Go to the S.F. Embarcadero to talk about if you are going to come (you may not want to come)
2. Always love your husband.
3. Enjoy!

🙈🍔🍟🍧🍵

<user_name>Sarah Weessies< /user_name><Date>1583861299918< /Date><rate>5</rate><Review>The Oakland Zoo is a fun family oriented zoo. It would honestly be fun for a date as well. This zoo has a lot of options to see animals and learn. The gondola ride gives you a great view of the Bay area. There's a really nice place to eat at the top where the gondola drops you off. If it's a warmer day go in there. They always have it at a cool temperature and the food is amazing.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSxyHBn9Pvkxy1KE-az9iHTOZcsB6lrlgBdMnz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnPvGnsDubSQ-FqM_dajdZIcCVW5jfcS7SAHfl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcqLHRTOfLwhVXPFTaCkMbYWl9KibK2s2LBxlb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>{'time': 1583969649950, 'text': 'Thanks Sarah for the review!'}</response><gmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Admission price is 24 dollars and there is a mandatory parking fee of 10 dollars. The entrance is up far on purpose with no pedestrian access. When inside, there are some rides that require more fees. The food concessions are overpriced - bring food and water from home! The zoo itself is pretty decent and not dilapidated even if many animals look pretty old. However at these prices it's a place for the rich. The upper part with the gondola is actually quite nice but all day I had to think how much I will have to work to pay for the whole family to enter here :(<//Review>

I would have given this zoo 5 stars but the staff arent very happy to be there. Most of the staff look bored and are on their phones. The facilities are SPOTLESS and the gondolas are SO MUCH FUN!!! The only downside to my day at the Oakland Zoo was the staff. Get some stuff that are happy to be there and enjoy their job!!< /Text>

<text>What a fun time! We recently went here and had an absolute blast. We had a great time checking out all of the animals and were pleasantly surprised and the quality of the pens here. The staff was friendly and we can't wait to come back once the new zone opens up on the hill!

Also, go see the elephants if you get the chance! They were so animated when we saw them, it was a very cool experience.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Open and currently practicing covid precautions. Must get your tickets roughly 2 weeks in advance with parking pass. Reserve your date and time space. Animals start getting put away at 4pm. Be sure to go see the elephants and zebras  towards the right after ur ride back gondola ride. Wish  there was more animals to view but happy with our zoo trip. Easy lovely and chill. Perfect weather and not alot of people. It was great with no lines.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

My kids loved seeing the animals! Every single animal on the brochure was there. There were plenty of hand sanitizing stations on site. The crew was very friendly and helpful. At times, security reminded folks to stay 6 feet apart or take turns watching animals.

If you have kids, I can't recommend Oakland Zoo enough!<//review>

I enjoyed the zoo. Be prepared to do a lot of uphill walking. It's pretty big for a local zoo. I advise bringing your own lunch and water. All the concessions were closed. Only a small gift shop was open. We were disappointed because we didn't get to see the lions, and a couple other exhibits were closed. The zoo does have a sky ride and an a gondola ride. Only one was working. There's a petting zoo for the kids. But only goats were available to pet. Toward the exit, there a small group of rides. A train, carousel, and some kids rides. It took us about 2.5 hours to walk and visit everything. So plan accordingly.</review>

My kids love it here, the free flying bird shows are great and they love feeding the Penguins & Lorikeets!! Outside play areas, places to have a picnic, cafe’s. You can go on a little train ride & there’s a big indoor jungle barn, where the kids can run wild & the parents can have a coffee…. Plus the staff are doing great work with these birds, training, charities, protection and their talks are very educational!! We buy return tickets every time!</review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>The day we went it was one of the hottest days. Even with that though the kids had a blast. It was not crowded  because  its reservations  only. Most the time people stayed away  and followed  the rules. I did see a couple people trying take off their mask  but as soon as they saw others looking they would put it back on. I think it would be a good idea  for them to out a couple spots throughout  the zoo to let people  remove  their masks to grab a drink or have a snack. Most the food was closed just the main places at the main entrance  and a couple spots for sweet treats. It was a good day though<//review>< pics>

Elephants!! Wide open (albeit hilly) terrain with great social distancing.

Currently the Oakland zoo has free parking during the pandemic. A great way to spend a few hours exploring the animals. Our favorites were the elephants, bears, tigers, and lions.

The skytrain gives you a very expansive view of the entire Bay area, absolutely gorgeous views! Highly recommend visiting!!<//Review>

The staff was very knowledgeable and the kids had a lot of fun. We got there before the zoo opened so we got good parking. Overall great experience and will go back< /Text>

One of my favorite zoos I've been to! Animals exhibits are quite spacious especially the new California Trail! Staff is very helpful and nice! The Gondola up to California Trail is a very nice addition.< /Text>

<review>A great experience to travel through this nicely constructed zoo space. It's really nice to see that the animals are given good amount of space and the enclosures are widely separated and spread across the area. There are also some fun facts and important information alongside the route and the enclosures which is fun to read. The ropeway that takes you up to the bear spot offers a great view of the Bay area. So all in all a great place to visit.</review>< pictures>

<text>The Oakland Zoo is absolutely one of the best zoos in the Bay Area.  It is clean, well laid out, family friend, well kept and fun.  It is apparent that the animals are well cared for and a lot of thought has been put into their habitats.  It is very easy to spend the entire day walking this spacious zoo.

All of my life we have been coming to the Oakland Zoo and my memories of it are from childhood to adulthood are wonderful and precious.  We have take nieces, nephews and now grand-babies here.

The Oakland Zoo is a Bay Area Gem and it promotes wildlife education and conservation.  If you go to its website you can access their wildlife cameras and watch the Sun Bears, Black Bears, Elephants and Condors live.  It is an excellent place to spend a day relaxing individually or as a family and build your own special memories.  This is a must do if you are any type of animal lover!  Don't miss the train ride, merry-go-round or especially the Gondola/Sky-Hi ride that gives you spectacular views of the SF Bay Area.   We love this Zoo, its animals and the team of people who make this place so magically wonderful.  Enjoy!</text>< pictures>

<text>Have enjoyed the Zoo in the past, and had some trepidation about going anywhere during Covid, but they have several measures in place to limit exposure.  Reservations were easy to get online, and the limited number of people made it easy to stay distanced while seeing the animals.  The gondola was constantly being disinfected, and really enjoyed the new native California area up on the hill.  Good option for doing something outside with the family.< /text>< username>

Took my 16 month old son and 8 year old daughter there on the weekend. Had a great time. Got there early so it didn't get too hot. Great fun for young children. My son and daughter both loved all of the animals. The bats were super cool. Train ride is awesome too!< /Text>

Wonderful experience seeing all animals up close. Best part is seeing animals being fed and interacting with the zoo staff who are always willing to answer questions and interact with children. Gondola ride is fun and they have a nice cafeteria above the hill which has some amazing views. All in all a great experience for kids, families and anyone who would like to enjoy a fun day</Text>

<time>1558927959094</time><rate>5< /rate><review>Very nice zoo with great views. Most animals have nice, large enclosures. Also a good variety of animals. Only negative of this is that there aren't very good view points to see the animals in some enclosures. The gondola was a nice ride and while the wolf habitat is currently closed, that section of the zoo is still definitely worth seeing. A lot better than I expected.</review>< pics>

Decently large zoo with a great variety of different animals. Very family friendly, multiple Cafe's, play areas.

There's a mini amusement park at the top parking lot complete with a train.

In the last couple of years they made a great expansion to the crest of the Oakland hills. You take a wonderful gondola ride to the upper facility, where you are treated to constant panoramic views of the bay area.

There is a large cafe, play area and new exhibits of native fauna such as bears, wolves, mountain lions, condors, eagles etc.

They also have a buffalo area where they help raise buffalo to repopulate a herd being reinstated by a native American tribe.

If you do nothing else take the gondola ride and have a bite at the cafeteria. Most impressive.
Be prepared to take a walk for parking though. They have multiple large lots but the place is very very popular and gets crowded by families every weekend.</text>

As a member, glad Oakland Zoo was finally able to finally open. Covid-19 safety protocols are in place and seem to be working well. There is always the odd idiot who takes their mask off or has it pulled down below their nose. Fairly easy to avoid these morons.</Review>

<Review>Beautiful location, well maintained and friendly staff. I had a much better time here than I did at the SF zoo even though this one is smaller. I will definitely come back when the new wing opens up.< /Review>< Pictures>

Good zoo to spend time with kids and families. Well maintained neat and clean surroundings. Not a big too but animals here are very active. Restuarant here   is expensive. I enjoyed the gondola drive. But not expect too much worth for the price.< /Review>

<user>117238233440849797570< /user><text>The zoo is big and the animals have a lot of space to roam around. The giraffe area could be expanded though. There are already six of them plus other animals and the ducks. Their area seems small for so many animals. This zoo does not have as many animals as one would expect. Still a nice zoo. This year the area was expanded and the Gondolas were added. You could ride them up to a new cafeteria section for free. The view of the whole Bay Area is spectacular especially on a clear day. Food here is quite expensive. A cup of coffee costs almost $5.<//text></record>

< review>
ProTip: Don't go when it's raining and/or cold. We went on a Saturday around 10:30 and it was lightly raining. The sign at the entrance said to decide if you want to go because the zoo might close. Luckily it didn't, but the animals weren't fans of the rain. The least kept up exhibit was the insect building; it also smelled pretty bad inside. Overall it was a good visit, especially the gondola ride to the California Trail. Also, to get a better view of the Bay than the bison overlook, go to the outdoor area of the nearby "visitor's center," which is actually a restaurant.< /review>

<text>I really like the zoo, but it was pretty crowded for me, in our COVID world. It was often difficult or impossible to remain fully distant, and lots of people didn't care to. On the upside, pretty much everyone was wearing masks, though you had the usual numbers of folks with noses out.

I went on a Saturday, so weekdays might be better in terms of crowds.< /text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Great zoo! I loved seeing the animals, but even better is you can tell this zoo is animal friendly and cares about them and not just bringing in money. They are also very environmentally friendly which is a plus! They have canned water instead of plastic water bottles! There are also very good views of the Bay Area here! The animal signs are very informative and interesting!</text>< Pics>

It's a fair sized zoo, with so much to offer. Animals are wonderful and their keepers certainly love their animals- talk to them! You'll learn a thing or two.
Highly recommend going towards the farm animals, Patrick the goat is a lover, give him a good pet for me!< /text>

A nice zoo to visit, great choice for family with small kids. A wide variety of native and exotic animals leave here. Especially, the tigers and the Jaguars are very impressive.<//review>

<Review>8 out of 10.... nice Zoo parking and instructions and where to go is a bit confusing.... but once we were parked and settled in everything was great, we did a overnight with the Boy Scouts and the docent staff was amazing, the docents who led us on our tour, the docents who took care of us and our sleeping accommodations and the docents who fed us did a great job, the educational and docent staff is simply incredible.... regarding our night tour could have been a little bit longer we did five  locations, would have been nice to do at least 8 or even 10 locations / exhibits considering we were there we had the time and it wasn't that late.. all in all a good experience thank you Oakland Zoo...<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ8y1Xk6wNzh2164SgTCp-Gqh520r_2r3AxLPv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY2-lbEQEEG2xwEkcf2PSwB7zETm-tI6mFU4M-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-9EGhnA0tiPBFXHOyMdywA47FSziZAd3Eo2hh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVXM-GXR2ye9o7LsEJ9Y0wiJXeF_Q8aQj-Rput=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW2erKn69aEeEU8GdC0OVI1BHRF2FZzQAZXv2t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPoUSPbnG6iCk4hW_OXiLPzjmI6sMSd3sTOiIz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeEVI7jPdY-e5kdEeTwPDA_kw-YY_hF0G0NlkJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRJjVaFGF0Y9RgAdImDK_R_qNhZPjQJmb4bdEo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEaD6_CcdHTBxZ6qz8dskvZSPdPSRQ6KDIWcbi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtoJbtYlCgrJ5FKIZ2ol-TcqLAmxm2qVsQuiO8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOd8NjwJyPQ_VaPz8kKQN3lWAriFGFkderaaEbN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtcR1ORo80o8ZGZJ6pFUNzTzYLbiPflt8Mn4Tz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3hHjpkveVa_hLHamu3n49wXPkF7P4ijvFmEau=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_tZ7WCE36SjFBdgz2VetUptXf_helm3_MLTbf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTX8msFykDpkUVV9NSVOL72JIedXENyqig8VuS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPonGE0clBXj9lwfMsclICJEfgf4I3DqRhcb3hO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlQ-zMAdxlsmzmk5KZ7DVJ0fVenybRQx0r-MHh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8WJPKPj5KRmJkr6HBSs1Khi3j3IxPi7IJMeRT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Really nice exhibits to view the animals and get some nice photographs. Great selection of animals including elephants. The tram to the new facility/restaurant is free and the food was suprisingly good. The staff was friendly and helpful. A few places could use some maintenance but the overall experience was outstanding. Looking forward to going back. Get there earlier than later as parking can fill up quickly.<//text>

Regardless, the animals are simply spectacular and the gondola rides are very relaxing and beautiful. I would definitely reccomend to all ages!< /Text>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>The Oakland Zoo remains my favorite bay area zoo.  They have done a stunning job handling covid at the park, with limited admittance, great demarcations to maintain social distancing, reminders to wear masks and sanitizing stations.  I was nervous at first to bring my 12 month old but the park knocked it out of the....park....

It was almost more enjoyable with the social distancing and limited admittance. Cannot recommend the zoo enough, even with covid.<//review>< time>

I have not been to this zoo in 30 years. And boy was it a nice surprise. The animal selection,  the layout was nice.
The park was pretty busy. The parking lot needs more handicapped parking. Overall a good place for the family.

My only negative would be that some employees are not very customer friendly.  Lack motivation.  But hey. It's not Disneyland.</text>

Haven't visited in years. It a a nice small local zoo with hand sanitation station through out. They have a gondola car to reach the back part of the zoo as you can't walk and they sanitize the cart after every guest and everyone must sanitize hands before entering. Felt safe and the park was enjoyable with time entry< /review>

<text>In all fairness the day we went was windy so the gondola was not running, and there were horrendous fires burning just north. When the gondola is not working, you can only access a smaller part of the zoo. The upper part of the zoo was totally off-limits since there was no gondola ride to take you up there.  That's a whole third of the zoo . So we missed out on a lot. The air was thick and Smokey. But even beyond that, I was a disappointed in the zoo. It needs a lot of TLC. You can definitely tell it is an older Zoo. The animals look well cared for and there are a lot of well-informed docents to answer questions or provide information. Some of the things that weren't that great, were the lack of a signage to get you around the zoo, the many empty cages and enclosures, the poor quality of the ground you walk on, lots of big gaps and cracks and bumps that are kind of dangerous, lack of good signage on the foliage around the zoo which truly does make it interesting. And lack of any type of commentary on the little train ride that is given. There was no, "Welcome to the train ride", no standard, " keep your arms and legs in the train ride", not even descriptions of the animals that we slow down to see from the train. It definitely needs an overhaul. Better training on behalf of the people that provide the train ride too.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdGfUVdDbDwbnb5enyATDSd3Xsdr9ObdqDm8m9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt1HDVx8E3BPgmjJI_-xf8umtAGNLC0Br_EKkY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8usqB7cw-WcFTOJYmZkJCiZrHxdOvitt1Z50_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZO6l06l-A_6DVn7maXBCfvASB2jI88pcA0IvI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPALGrACLU2y41wjxkiMVbpDL68UP_gIa7Qvimd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl5OgZyc-XTDhgzM13-EjBc-momfdGg8sAH03o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmXWokRuUq5PIjod9dfu7ImjJMTaHxSL3kCTLT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5pAIEeb3JAfI3DeicRP1YbJPbUOwIVti3fiis=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd_MXGJIgXkS8FLqJcWLro1apl1YWNt6U6jN1U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_ZSgja2IZYaTGrZdzzjsLe07H1yAFVh7xyWWH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVGwb25sSoC3qg3d4tmjgNhw6nWqsqw2K9Jept=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpT01tZkaz7_Z9gbjQbrZk3EBiUDdm65xbwiVL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

What a pleasant surprise! Oakland does not have the best reputation, and I figured that I might be disappointed. I was wrong. So wrong. The zoo is well-maintained, the animals were well cared for, and it was fin for both the adults and children. The California enclosures are currently being built, but you can take the gondola up to the top of the zoo property for a spectacular view. From the cafe you can see a HUGE section of the bay, including the ship yards, bridges, and the city below. It is a bit breezy up there to say the least, so make sure to bring a sweater on cooler days. The zoo is great for photographers, with both animals and beautiful gardens to capture. We did not have enough time to see everything, even though we were there for 3.5 hours. We pass through the area often and will definitely be back. San Francisco Zoo has some neat exhibits, but many of the buildings and habitats are closed and rotting away. SF Zoo is mostly flat, whereas the Oakland Zoo is carved into the side of a small mountain. I have mobility issues, and the hills wore me out, so plan some extra time to stop and rest along the way if you have difficulty walking or tire easily. This zoo reminded me a lot of the San Diego Zoo, albeit on a bit smaller scale.<//Review>

<Text>I've traveled to many zoos and this one remains one of my favorites. It has a nice variety of animals and interactive experiences for kids and adults alike. My family has had a family membership for the Oakland Zoo for the past five years, and I encourage everyone who wants to visit to buy a membership. Being a member gives you free parking, early notification of new events, and has reciprocal benefits at most zoos across the country. I also recommend arriving early if you want to see the lions and tigers active opposed to just sleeping in their habits.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_V0AfoJmAHJC6LFt6aaGKRRgfODxkSBXetVBG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCiGIZml_Kzg6CPejvop1GFDadylhqUbtf90Qt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLwtgdKy05NmP6QjAh6fYhrBLwG1kQ61qien1Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The best part is the gondola and the upper part is all native california, wolves, condors, mountain lion, bears. It's cool. Find them so they can  continue to rescue animals from all around and release them. It's not just the animals you see.<//Text>

<review>It's a lovely zoo but I didn't feel safe. The cashier took my phone in her bare hand to scan tickets, and it was very difficult to remain socially distant as we walked around. Hand sanitizer stations throughout.<//review>< Pics>

Beautiful place to have a very good relaxing day. Some animals hide, but I understand them. Got to see a lot of our fellow animal friends some I have never seen in my life. I enjoyed the cable car ride which took us to the big lounge-balcony area where you can eat! There are different areas that are divided into “continents” and each of them represent its own animals. You can take a train ride between the areas that cost a little over one dollar per person. Please go on a sunny day, you will enjoy much better.<//text>

Great Zoo! The upper area, that can be reached with the gondola, is a must as this is what really completes the experience. The bottom part is a bit old and could be rejuvenated but the overall ambiance is not destroyed by these details that could be improved. Most employees are great to deal with, especially the ones that handle animals and are clearly passionate about it. I write "most" because I ran into 1 exceptionally silly person who didn't give me enough tickets, which I had paid for, for the train and then made me pay again... but oh well, wasting $3 wasn't really worth running my day by arguing with an idiot...<//Text>

<resp>{'time': 1597166951250, 'text': 'Thanks Brian for the great and thoughtful review! This is definitely a learning opportunity for us and feedback like this is extremely helpful in creating new protocols to keep our guests safe.'}</resp><text>We went Sunday August 2nd a few days after they opened again. Overall it was a great experience! The animals seemed more active than I remember, so maybe they were happy to see us again. Even the jaguar wasn't pacing.

The staff did a pretty good job considering the constraints they had to work under. They had people at various places directing everyone and I still saw many of them really enjoy talking with the guests while keeping safe.

There were a few downsides. While almost everyone wore a mask as directed, it was difficult at certain key places to keep 6 feet apart. Especially at the entrance there were a lot of people at the gift shop while we were trying to walk in. If they could temporarily move the gift shop somewhere else, that would be ideal I think.

Second, it was very difficult to keep kids from touching the glass. There are signs and people walking around reminding people not to touch the glass but it is difficult. Our kids did a fairly good job at it but still was very difficult to completely avoid.

Third, they did a great job cleaning each gondola as people got out, but the bottom had 3 separate lines and it was difficult for them to go in order and keep cleaning. I feel like they had the toughest job. They should do a single line at the bottom just like they do at the top.

Hopefully they are able to keep everything open, we would like to be able to keep going safely!</text></record></dataset><record>

We had booked online tickets last week for today, but unfortunately we have family members that developed cold symptoms last night. In an effort not to put others at risk and be considerate, we asked to change the tickets, but the operator refused and told me " we didn't ask you to purchase tickets if you have a cold". Were we supposed to predict that we will have a cold on the particular date? How inconsiderate and disrespectful during times of COVID. If you are asking people not to come if they have a cold, you should have some flexibility with your tickets policy. Unbelievable that we have to deal with this in addition to being sick.< /review></record></dataset><record>

One of the best zoos I have been to. The zoo is not too big or too small for you to cover. Just the right size for you to cover in less than a day. All animals look like they are taken care of pretty well. The new California trail features wolves, Jaguar, bears and American bison. Amazing zoo definitely worth a visit.< /text>

<review>Excellent zoo. Reasonable price for admission and food. All around very clean. Even though I feel bad for most animals in zoo's the animals here had very spacious areas to roam, all enclosures were clean and filled with toys, ropes, etc. for activity and what I consider most important - private spaces. Nice Job.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgh0V2vFnIqaYVNsVIjz7OBHWLvewrhXHzxH08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf47HCA3rmqB1CqarKSWBuzaNCxomBXpUYBUip=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLJ5r8jymwBXe4zUW9DlJUJh76Q3W45mKrCYQ5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>{'time': 1580322318682, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving a review Tom!'}</resp><gmap_id>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great zoo, spread out so it doesn't feel crowded. The new California trail is a must see with lots of activities for kids. The bear exhibit was huge and we got to see the beard up close! My 5 year old spent a lot of time playing on the playground in the trail, and the cafeteria is a great place to lunch before heading back down the hill.

I highly recommend as a day trip, is even 2 days to split up the California trail and the rest of the zoo, but get there early so you don't have to worry about parking or stand in a huge line to ride the free gondola.</text>

<Text>Great way to spend an afternoon. Half a day should be enough time to get around and see the main things.
Some of the highlights for us were the Gibbons on their island. Be sure not to miss them.
A couple of other things worth seeing are the flying foxes on the way out are also definitely worth a visit ( mainly since you don’t see those very often) and also the reptile house (very nicely done with a few different terrariums and very active little guys to see).< /Text>< pictures>

Wonderful place! The work they do and education they provide is so important to the community. The Covid-19 precautions they have in place make you feel safe and comfortable so you can enjoy the zoo.<//Text>

Yes, this is a small aquarium. However, it is only $20 dollars for "locals", so I think it is well worth the price. The tunnel is super cool, and they have many other nice displays. I wish there was more education information. I definitely would recommend going once or twice.</review>

Fantastic zoo. Loads to see and do.
The animals all look well cared for. The enclosures and the zoo in general look in excellent condition.

Great zoo, friendly people.  Not crowded at all (which may be due to how well they do social distancing).< /text>

Best zoo. Even if there were no animals, the Oakland Zoo is just a great park. You must purchase tickets ahead of time; they only allow a certain amount of reservations at a time due to the covid pandemic.<//review>

They recently added a newer level to the park that wasn't accessible before but now through the gondola you can rise above and see a whole new circle and many much more animals, such as the Grizzlie bears and buffaloes as well as  mountain lions and its really nice and worth the visit if you haven't been in a while or ever.<//Review>

It's big.  Animals not caged. They are in areas that mimic their surroundings in the wild.  Good selection of animals. Fun for the whole family.<//text>

My son loves the gondola and the staff is very friendly about letting you ride over and over again, especially when they are not busy. Some great views of the lions from the sky ride.

<text>Surprised at how great this zoo was.   Parking was a... zoo, but that's be expected on a Sunday with nice weather.  We really enjoyed the elephant exhibit, the Gibbons, and the orangutans.  Plan on spending a couple hours to see all the animals.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The team ride for $3 was so worth while and so much fun!!! It was a great way to see the African Safari animals and a spectacular view on the ride back. Very nice zoo.< /Text>

<Text>It is a stunningly beautiful place to be. Exotic animals, and great zookeepers make this place amazing. The layout of the zoo keeps one curious and engaged. The gondola ride is a must.

There is surprisingly spacious room for all the animals so they look relaxed and naturally behavioring. The introduction to animals is loving and educational. Some areas are closed now due to the COVID situation, but the good side is that this place is less crowded so we could stay long and observe the animals at great spots. I really appreciate that the staff is making great efforts to protect the health of visitors.</review>

Wonderful zoo, so many animals, super well organized and curated. The gondola was spectacular and different experience from other zoos I've visited. Great day spent here.<//Review>

< Review>
I was troubled by the lack of space the Oakland Zoo provides for the Bald Eagle. The Eagle expressed distress when I was last there. The Eagle would repeatedly fly to the top of the nettting as if trying to escape. Any sentient being desperately trying to escape to freedom is one of the saddest and traumatic things to witness.
The zoo does not provide nearly enough space for a bird that is known for flying at high altitudes.
I wish they would release the Eagle(s) to a more fitting and spacious animal reserve if there is no possibility of rehabilitation back into the wild.<//Review>

I hadn't been to a zoo since I was a little kid and this one was quite fun and a chill experience. There was a wide variety of creatures to look at and I got the feeling they took good care of them. If you're looking for a relaxed way to spend an afternoon, this is the way to do it. They are opening a new section of the zoo in July that I didn't get to see but it looks very promising, with larger exhibits that try to place the animals in something more like their natural habitats. You even get to ride a lift with an amazing view up to the new area where there is a café with the same view. We were able to go up to the café, but not into the new area of the zoo.<//review>

It is positively delightful, beautiful and very clean. It cost $24 for admission plus tax. Tickets can be purchased there and online. With this, it's free to ride the gondola up to the California Trail. Skyrides cost an extra $3. Note, it is really cold up there now(December) so dress appropriately. Also, make sure you wear comfortable shoes coz you will walk alot. Parking cost $10 so you can park across the zoo and walk to the gate. Finally, it is a fun place for adults and children. Enjoy!</Text>

There are hidden gems throughout the zoo, like the children's area where your can pet goats and sheep. Really a lovely and well tended place.</review>< pictures>

Pointed at animal butts, petted the goats, rode the gondola, train, and let the inner child out.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3CN9tml7PyeACLMxUhnqANJCTMXsJ-z98dN9n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsYDCzl21ZICbJ5U0QGJFCQD2oeBRGYX0a8tk9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKihS23keFfSahmHs3Rm-tQe0i3SQW1b2nYgAu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp7pU0TMVVFkK85m5p-O3x2fy0zdCp_exOds98=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWoAVf2-PxhDPZ4ICZYi7mcMkudY6czS3MFJ_3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNasvZVGyqKgzfALg-E4IoWxDqV9IymZqm_zpzp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObsY1MBgmUdprgmsAcSGMGo7u9dF3NllKOFRO_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAa5fxO_IvSR3-gBkc3qKJ2ppB0Vshr9AdjWTc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrF-fn__qNhE41cTo55ukRw2iDicczoBv2Ucb3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMS4M-TkWsVSb-FhUEQ4tTHXHGQFzvSk2DBiAni=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9YNGNmSGAjwrIIFTUbvqKNgfXwvrYx366LXMS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiHBXKuQgu6j_-SOTK7bdxhXynCdjzg87vBABJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuMkxplT4T31rJihby0XqYr3mQz15aYqeCbi8W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQSL7cL0PKdXfxVb_DiryiFv1zmVT_4aWP37cI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< user_name>

Lovely and relaxing walk around zoo. If get there at morning feeding time you get to view most of the animals. The tram ride up and down offers great views of the bay area.</Review>

First time visit and decided to come on a rainy day.  The crowds were minimal and the animals were very playful. It was really fun seeing the animals happy and interacting more.< /text>

Very nice newly constructed upper area.  Great view of the bay.  Fun play structure for the kids.  Better than expected food at the new cafe.  Garlic fries is a must try. Feeding for the bear was also fun to watch.  Not as nice as the San Diego zoo but the price is also much digestible.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Great place to go. The new gondola has a great view and the food is excellent. However, the food is expensive. The train ride is ok but you should really go see the new exhibit. You can also take a few photos from the top. Its expensive to get in but, if you like animals, you will not be disappointed.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4K2pMcc-_eBsEDBepLL4ZQqn830DHFCNO7lEa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaqQ6XNlfaBgyEVDlbueZt4nROvyZNT9o21xDn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWOEmahctiQpNJY0-q0papt2SZy8a5kJs0L--O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Pretty awesome day at OZ, even in heavy rain. View from the cafe at the top of the gondola is awesome. Young bears play-wrestling was cute/disturbing. Wolves, condors, and jaguar were awesome. Fruit bats were surreal!< /text>

<Text>A fun day out for the whole family. All your favorite animals are here, along with some unusual additions from around the world (but mostly Africa). There's even a place to pet goats and sheep 🐐🐑

There's a common area for lunch and kids to run around, and a few pricey places to grab some eats. The new FREE gondola takes you to the top of a hill where there's a panoramic view of the entire Bay.

If you live nearby and have kids, consider the membership. 🐒🐯🐗🐢🐪</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz6L9Aa3BfbElmTdf29Au2yAJnUmImaeBdafu6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNogn1l_nDT1jCP1_3IyKZtBfvxKwFd-slY6i0B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpNjMBAyqic5lJDI28fjVnsjSkj9CILOPQN5V7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpwmn-xSI-eJWmoH9G_9f7Ybp1nt7EcXs_w6VU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPfPAWkc_EfHs1kXiYU967LX1_0IgeEohjtPas=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpZFNXj62-aNrc9dQzmrLGQfUrsODz1bRSmrcl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjvmoK6-V5FTMCX0lglDi9JCH6nzx8zTZ1xRmM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw2GaffdmbLDI-fNZ295M-zItHcP4POGy9gm3O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUxExsUTMS9MAlDA5Jp-Jc7A0GLBVdVtnlVoQz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1523658110790, 'text': 'Thanks for the feedback.

Spectacular Christmas Zoolights, attracting a lot of visitors. The Festival of lights are well done, well synchronized, crowded but worth the visit. The scenic Gondola ride is a must! Lovely view of the Bay Area, day and night. There’s a restaurant atop the visitors viewing Center and everything is lovely!
Parking lots are available, enough for every visitor. Always worth a visit when in the Bay Area.<//review>

I always enjoy coming to this zoo. Only zoo with Elephants in the bay area. I love the opportunity to watch feeding time for the animals. Love the new gondola and new animals recently added. We definitely spend an entire day here. Recently heard about the overnight stay options, will definitely have to check that out!< /Text>

The insect section is horrible. The room needs lighting. It needs more insects - there's just too much empty space. The floor could use tiling. I hope a millionaire ends up reading my review and donates a chunk of money to improve this section. Maybe they will name the insect section after the donor's name. How about Warren Buffet? How about Mark Zuckerburg? This area is only one star. The rest of the zoo us four stars.</Text>

So not very often I would make a post like this but you guys deserve top ratings and I truly believe that the cost to enter the zoo right now is way too little it should be more.... Beautiful space beautiful animals what can I say not to mention the Skyride just fantastic.</Review>

<username>Mike Johnson< /username><text>I enjoyed the zoo very much. It seems well kept and well managed. It is a scenic walk even if there were no animals.  The big Surprise for me was the gondola ride to the east side of the park offering stunning views of the Bay. The structures on that side of the park were  beautiful including the cafe and the wooden decks/platforms made for walking, standing and viewing. I liked the environment throughout the zoo where the animals are kept (the enclosures) from The birds to the tigers.
What I didn't expect, was to have to pay $10 for parking. I also thought the admission fee might be less than what it was. I don't know what the average price of admission for zoos are Nationwide, but it seems a little high to me. Maybe it's just because I haven't been to a zoo in a while or maybe it's because it's located in California.<//text>< Pics>

As members, we were thrilled to learn the zoo opened back up! Very easy and convenient online tickets reservation after visiting the website. A+ service passing through the parking and zoo entrances. The animals were very active, especially the grizzlies! It almost felt like we had the zoo to ourselves, except when some groups weren’t socially distancing whatsoever! I am pretty disappointed I didn’t see any staff wiping down anything!?! And the one staff that came to clean the restrooms didn’t practice social distancing with me, and I was the only one in there. We’ll be back next weekend!</text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Great zoo to take your family to. Easy access from the freeway. Parking  cost $10 per vehicle. Tickets are $25 for adults,  $20 per children.
Zoo location is on the side of the mountain,  so, there is many up and down walking trails, bring your comfortable shoes. The animals looks healthy, and good varieties. Good kids play area, and a petting yard.
Stop for lunch at Tusker Grill to enjoy a burger, or salad.  Try their Gilroy garlic fries.
Or, take the gondola ( free with your paid admission) to the California trail to enjoy your lunch, and see more animals after.  Make San Francisco bay overlook area as your last stop to enjoy a breathtaking view of the SF bay.</text>< pictures>

A Place where my grandparents visited while they were dating, and subsequent alternative to Fairyland, the Oakland zoo has held up well after, nearly a century of operation, and adapted with the times, and practices of some much bigger zoos in the United States.
One of our favorites was the Chimp there, (At least I think it was a chimp, hey what do you want, I was like, 5) who would mimic us kids and sometimes tag us with a piece of candy or a nutshell.
This is Oakland History. AND somehow still unknown to many younger East Bay residents. Change that! Go and visit!</Text>

<text>The zoo is decent now, but will almost double in size with wolves, bears and more lions in summer 2018. While some areas are a bit of a let down, it has already a wide variety of animals and habitats including the very entertaining train ride through the Australian Outback (paid separately as is with the sky ride).

Definitely use the free Gondola to go uphill even if you come before summer 2018, the view is very worthwhile and the right company will make it a very nice experience.</text><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

<Text>Most exhibits were open, which was nice.  Hardly saw staff to ask about animals.  Half the information boxes were wired wrong or not working.  Extremely limited on drinking locations (buying or refilling).  Only 1 gondola was working (the one that goes up to the mountain lion), so it took longer to get through the zoo.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1601578860178, 'text': 'Hello Kaycee. Thank you for leaving a review. We love getting feedback from our guests because it allows to grow as an organization. Regarding the talk boxes, we had some issues recently with the power outages turning off power around the Zoo which affected the boxes. We have had our Maintenance Department go through and fix any issues so this has been attended to. We have passed on your comment about staff to the appropriate department. Due to the COVID safety closure, we have not been able to bring back all of our Education staff. We are slowly getting back on track and hope to have more staff roaming around for your questions :) Thank you again for reaching out and hope to see you soon!'}< /resp><GmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The admission is not cheap, but they have to feed the animals.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaH2SbmljOGaHkichOeEpeY-S3BetADSuy-7AL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRcSQeNHIACg3L54X88z0HtA_JatnTB83aqeyl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpWejaY3-zVgDDlr3uSd7kH4vdkPDoRCYY7rIB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFI8PtXDGvyz5AVNQTn4V-JdWnKCDCu4SjdZSR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-JT2gCVICt6vd7FoHn6kZHBdG4H7DYDrH3GIO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

👍  Fun ride up gondola with 91 yr old Mother. Fun nature walk on upper level of expanded zoo grounds. Good visibility of wildlife in natural like settings.  Courteous staff, lovely view, tasty cafeteria food.<//text>

<user>110197456035072123880<//user><text>I have come here 3 time since last year. I have come to enjoy very much Oakland's zoo  The first time the draught showed a terrible impact on the zoo's vegetation and animal and the ambiance was dusty but on February and may the park looked amazing and the animals also enjoyed the new condition as well. I love taking the sky ride to go to the upper part and the views. There is quite a good variety of animals throughout the zoo and the bears,  jaguar, tigers, and elephants are quite impressive. I definitively recommend a family membership if you live in the area and come multiple times throughout the year.<//text>< Pics>

<text>We went to the zoo during the COVID situation and we were pleasantly surprised how neat and well maintained it was. Hand sanitizers were placed throughout the zoo. I could also see the gondolas being cleaned and sanitized after every ride. We felt safe and had a fun outing.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Has some great animal and more to come. The price is high so if you have a family get the annual pass since the price of a annual pass is amount the same amount of a one day pass. Also if great place for a workout single the zoo is on a hill.

-Pokemon Go player
The place has a lot of pokestops and 2 or 3 gyms. T-mobiles user may have internet issues.<//Text>< pictures>

Not the biggest zoo but nice exhibits.  Have not been to a zoo in a long time and  so seeing live animals like giraffes and elephants was pretty cool.  Can cover most of the zoo in a couple of hours.  Lions , and tigers, and bear oh my.< /Review>

<review>The zoo has a lot to offer and doesn't take too long to walk around since it has the distinct areas. We started off with the Sky Ride (an extra $3 per person) and got to see over the giraffes, lions and elephants. From there we went to see the baboons, siamang and monkeys and birds. They have a really nice collection of insects, but there were only a few reptiles in the other area. The black bears, grizzly bears and meerkat were all resting so they weren't out when we hit the exhibits.

Overall it was a fun visit on the 1st or January. My favorite things were the sun bears, the lazy petting goats and the emu that tried to escape on the train with us.</review><Name>Phil M<//Name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg_sYfubdM2ZCaCZbX6wXBwQae9imZ2hNXG8mp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOr48MIMM2S2vBiCtEjCwm8b6lbRqpgUbkX9D2R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMabg36-bkoAB0tA4qy7pGi6J0w7CteRH8TxZwa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsJ7V1H06kZgVCnT10h0C2q7V8Cyz8gez9jLk8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWSUDJz4XJB3qeWpvvUA2XQO1mMdASvNt4GAAY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqYYim6MawweLn4rB6BcGG-dHy-zhBsCpvPrpO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-KetsJury5NioawxCiSLs9B7ZwJSmP93GQJfn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3LTrVGPnsWJlYHBuM-hYBTrO4Q0lhsyU0wXTc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbB7y6y96NNyNwudM2-wb0dUp6iaWmlrz_W0o-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9Z-nogLqCsppuygmyIUVnkQcXInuYd5Ab8FYA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNf2x6gHvSw_7VoWm1kxQyFtiZaA9w5fV5lF90g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOc8Np2DGBFqcDFADN2JCfuezfbJIKekzYH2Is3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO89pwIB-poc2pCEk-NWZ0bT-svBXkRnHQRPgUo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< gmap_id>

Lot of educational information written all along the path. Gandola ride is beautiful and that ride is included in the zoo entrance fee. They have restrooms everywhere.
They have ample parking along with shuttles to help people get to the entrance. And also very clean and well maintained.</Text>< Pictures>

I love wild life, environment sustainability, and fun! If those are also your cup of tea, the this is the place to go. wether you are a local of a tourist looking for something unique try it! The staff is very friendly and caring. Also now, if you visit and it's your birthday, make sure to tell the staff, you get a birthday pin. When a staff see's you, you get a smile and happy birthday! :)</review>

The line to get into the zoo was extremely long (for a Saturday morning) We arrived around 10:30 am and there was little to no parking left. However, I noticed that when we were leaving at around 1pm there was a whole lot of parking available in the front since the people that arrived in the morning were starting to leave.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Took my daughter and her cousin here, it’s been almost two years since we visited. They enjoyed it, saw the huge tigers and giraffe, the pet zoo was fun for them. The giant tortoises too.</Review></record>

While at the outset , I was unsure of what fan fare to expect for a hefty $24 entry fee , I was pleasantly surprised at what the zoo had to offer. Starting with the maps which my toddler could interpret owing to the animal silhouettes that line up, through the Australian safari on a clickety clack steam train, up the sky ride over the lion, camel and the elephants, going further up to the enclosed gondola giving not only a magnificent view of the cities,but also taking one to the California Trail, the zoo just rocks.

From a toddler's perspective it was sheer delight given the fact that I eased his walks with a stroller to go everywhere. The trails are covered with greenery making the walks a non issue even on a hot day. Conveniently placed stores , restrooms and water stops make enjoying the animals your only option! I was impressed with the magnificence of the African section with the Giraffes, Elephants and Elands.

I would highly recommend this place for a full day trip with your family. The well maintained trails, the carefully manicured enclosures with ample space and human created mimicry of natural features like stone walls, deserts, water falls etc along with geographically apt flora make the fauna come to life.<//Review>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>Went to the Zoo on Saturday. This is a very beautiful Zoo we love the terrain and how well kept it is. I was really disappointed at how crowded it was. I felt really uncomfortable at how many people the Zoo let in at once. It was very hard to social distance because it was that crowded. I did appreciate the staff cleaning the high touch surfaces and keeping the Zoo clean.</Review>< Name>

<Review>Had to choose a time slot for visiting, nice because there were very few people. Staff spraying sanitizer inside gondolas and on people's hands before going on. Some habitats were closed, but most were open. Appreciated that there was plenty of soap in the restrooms. Cafe on the hill was closed.</Review>< response>

<review>The covid protocols are pretty simple to navigate and reassuring. Buy tickets or reserve with your membership online and have them printed or on your phone when you arrive. The Baboon bridge gets too crowded to be safe, if that's a special one for your kid(s) be aware it may not be on the itinerary. The mask rules for kids are above and beyond state recommendations (a good thing, most kids can keep a mask on), however the staff did not harass me when my developmentally disabled child who is older than 3 refused to keep his mask on halfway through our visit. We were able to distance further from people at that point because it is not crowded at all. Gondolas are sprayed with disinfectant after each use and hand sanitizer is provided before boarding. All in all a very stress free outing after months of staying home.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The zoo is always fun,  if a bit crowded. We were a bit late to go to the new section,  but enjoyed seeing all these animals anyway. Parking is interesting here at times,  but we're got lucky!<//text>

<Review>Oakland zoo is large and you can easily spend the WHOLE day here. Wear some comfortable shoes, some of the paths will be going uphill/downhill. Bring a stroller for younger children as they may get tired from walking, but it you forget it, they do have stroller rentals available. Bathrooms are located throughout the park as well as drinking stations and food kiosks. There are several feeding times throughout the day and trainer talks. They have an app you can download that helps with the schedules and also map of the zoo. They have a new California trail that recently opened. You'll have to take a skyline ride to get to it. There are also several kids play area throughout so you can let them play run around a bit and you can sit have a break lol< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXnN1mZ-lLftHItLuJJRlwKM_S1Of388Q603lM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh1StcF52-6kscS7Ol9wc0yhLKop8gynVDsir4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgmrzO9V3FCagOlAFkkI9fJ2eY4-EA2cVq_C8w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcekp1xJLHfxsqT_6M2lsmZfVeYEpXJOYywINu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ5jx9fsVRcO8-VKIon1T8hL7WaNWWeWmpPyqk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRhXO38LkAVjuEVd22c84aN4OFXbF4wicKPgJG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqlVgxAQgL3ixc2sSqcZMQzRw6bHlfU8h7TAkS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiQe2Wo_9J2dvyhILiDBf_tWI-vgcJF3NoQ4NU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>113520200107396087494</UserId.><resp>None</resp><Date>1536326282343<//Date>< name>

<Review>This zoo is easy to get to and the animals look very happy. Nice place to take kids. It is really fun if you go in early morning when they first open. The animals are more receptive and  alert. I bring my breakfast and eat it in the park. The week day is better for me because it is less crowded, and more quiet. This is zoo is a nice place for an outing.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1577383050140, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving a review!'}</Resp><date>1577218359219< /date><gmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa</gmapID></record>

Went midday on a Wednesday, and it wasn't too crowded. The COVID precautions seemed sufficient. Lots of hand sanitizer stations around.<//text>

COVID UPDATE: A sizable portion of the zoo is closed as of the writing of this review. All of the drinking fountains are closed so expect to bring your own water or prepare to purchase the aluminum water bottles.

Only one refill station is available immediately after the gondola.

Masks on all the time rule was okay with me and my party but may be difficult for those with breathing problems especially on hot days like when I went (93°F).

If you want to support the zoo, think about donating via their website. Otherwise, save your money for the full reopening.<//text>

Went to the zoo this october and it was really nice. The zoo limits the number of people who can come to the zoo through their reservation system online and the entrance fee is not expensive at all. There is few exibits for food near the entrance (which closes by 3pm) and a stand that sells snacks inside so either pack a lunch for your family or eat before going to the zoo. Any part of the zoo that is enclosed is closed. The animals seem to love it since it's very quiet. We enjoyed it and spent about 4 hours there. Plenty of areas with sanitizer stations.<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>So fun! We have annual family passes and they paid for themselves in just 3 visits. Since we don't have to pay every time we go in we pop by for lunch (the food is really lame but the view is unbeatable), take friends and family, ride the gondola at sunset.

I love the giraffes, elephants, hilarious monkeys, bats, camels. The baboons are AWESOME , always running around, playing tag, wrestling. And there's all ages from a tiny baby baboon that hangs out on it's mom's back to a big cool old dude who just chills while the others wait on him all day.

The kids area at the Oakland zoo is perfect, too --both my 3 yo niece and 9yo nephew could both really enjoy almost all the rides (he was too tall for just one of them). And they have a Little Free Library on one of their nature paths!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxfdgd_BAVxeFcVrdo2GB5HYPjZZwFtb6XAlJt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsXHnqYjJYxTNCpqT0vfuntjkjF56Uq-Os_8QE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVYxqVL1CEvn3ilOu4-7eM4BlRSnMoj1tYKQfc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT4LzpAuuR5_2HyYlT79lodTSPZFk_WvPvCXrI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP30wTmNMNUowgsA_bzSuoVpMPfZu_Mqvh_Dr2i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSvuB6bAJX3dOIhBswtPHCvUqrtVZSGcTR8pfg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBq6KUIyiNB6UVIH0wlc144GtzJb1jAWDRPqOt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<Review>The Oakland Zoo is nice, but Indo wish some of the animals had larger areas. There are rides for the children in adventure landing that cost a little extra, but not to much. Overall I recommend going a few time.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa< /gmap_id></record>

We have had a great time, each time we've gone. My daughter loves the animals, and learning about them. It's a smaller zoo, nothing huge and fancy, but it's well cared for. It's clean, the enclosures are nice and nothing looks horrible. I do hope they are able to update more and more as they've been doing this last year.</text>

<Review>What a rip off with this place. Seriously $20 per kid it's not like they're feeding the animals or playing with them and then adults $25 that's reasonable for grown ups that have never seen any wild animals in captivity. The wait time is ridiculously long and they're not set up with any type of shade for kids or grown ups.  They should close this for good and release all the wild animals back into the wild.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1597684099210, 'text': 'Thanks for your review. None of the animals are releasable back to the wild since most were born in a Zoo or came from a rescue situation. We try to keep their habitats as natural as possible and unfortunately they naturally come from places that are very hot. Please make sure to check the weather forecast before your visit next time if you are concerned about the heat.'}<//Response>

< review>
If you are in Bay Area, do not miss out this place. I like the size of this considering the kids you are bringing in with. Open gandola will take you to one side of the allowing you have birds eye view of the zoo whereas new gandola- cable car- is new addition. The cafe at top of the zoo site gives a breathtaking  view of bay area and pacific ocean. Definately recommended.</review>

The last time I was here, wasn't for the animals. I was here for a meeting with Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. I've been very involved in this organization, a great cause. Yes, I have also gone here for the animals.< /Text>

This zoo went through a recent expansion adding what is known as the California Trail.  Basically more than doubling the previous Zoo size.  Bald Eagles, Condors, Cougers, Black Bears, Grizzly Bears and more.  Keep in mind this in addition to what was previously there, like Tigers, Lions, Elephants, oh my and more.  With the expantion comes a higher price too, but you get to see so much more as well.  An added bonus is the views of San Francisco are pretty awesome from this new portion of the Zoo.<//Text>

It’s a fun place to visit with your family . The gondola ride was the star event of the day and views were breathtaking. The petting zoo was also a fun activity.</review>

Five stars.  It was beautiful zoo.  I'm so surprised how big the areas were.  I enjoyed the gondola ride and seeing the gorgeous view of the bay, I would recommend everyone to come here and I would come back.   Also, be sure to check your library's Discover and Go program for free admission AND parking (Tues-Thurs only!) We scored both, which saved us a chunk of money.  Arrive early for parking and bring sunglasses, a hat and bottled water, especially if it's sunny out.</review>

<Text>Heard some good things from friends and the reviews on Google.  There is also the Oakland Zoo App.  I have to say we had a great time exploring everything that the zoo had to offer.
All the employees we interacted with were very nice and friendly.  Some of the enclosure's are very large and like the lions, they hang out in the back where it might be hard to seeing them through the telescopes.  I would suggest to ride the 'Sky Ride' it's $3 each, you get a great view of the lions, giraffes, camels and bison.  Take the  gondola to a cafe, visitor center and the second part of the zoo, with the all new areas that opened in 2018.  Really enjoyed the Grizzly enclosure huge with lots of viewing areas.<//Text>< time>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Date>1567214053296< /Date><Text>We went on a Saturday and it was PACKED!

We tried to park in the parking lot as we saw people leaving but they wouldn’t let us in and made us park on the exit road but still charged us for parking, not a good start to the day.

The new part of the zoo was pretty nice, but it takes a while to get up there from the lift and there’s only a few animals up there.

I’m sure we would have had a better time had it not been sooooo crowded.

The only other feedback was that some of the exhibits were “too natural habitatish” so we couldn’t see the animals.< /Text>< resp>

<Text>On the smaller side for a zoo. Needs maintenance, but the gondola is nice and looking forward to the new exhibits/animals summer of 2018. The gondola was nice the week it was open, and has been closed for a very long time :( Rides at Adventure Park are separate and you have to buy tickets. The staff at Adventure Park are outwardly disgruntled and yell back and forth about how much they hate operating the rides, distracting kids and families who are having fun. Half the rides are broken and Adventure Playland looks like a depressing wasteland.<//Text><response>None<//response>< userid>

<Review>We got to see the animals really active, and they have so many of most of them.
The grizzly bears were particularly fantastic, there were so many of them and they were actively playing, bathing, and eating. Their bath pond is right up against the glass so you can see them up close!< /Review>< user_name>

Love the Oakland Zoo! The animals have large enclosures and the zoo keepers are always out and about willing to discuss animal diets and habits with children. The new gondola takes you to a whole new conservation walk area and restaurant. Start with the flamingos and turn right to walk counter clockwise around the zoo path. Tigers, giraffes, camels, lions, birds, elephants, zebras, meercats, hyenas, wart hogs, baboons, crocodiles, bugs, petting zoo, pigs, goats, sheep, bats, otters, turtles, lemurs, giant tortoises, toucans, monkeys, sun bears (often hiding in that beautiful enclosure), deer and more I'm sure I missed. Fun to enjoy again and again. Buy a family membership for free parking and more discounts.<//text>

Nice selection of animals and more exhibits on the way.  A lot of hills so be prepared to walk up and down them throughout your visit. Bring a lunch.< /Text>

The new area adds so much. This is one of the best zoo's and just got better. Unlike San Diego the enclosures look more natural.<//text>

The most peaceful zoo layout in the country. Animals are free to roam, comfortably. The sky ride on a sunny day offers spectacular views of the bay and both downtown Oakland and San Francisco.< /Text>

This place is massive. If you like to hike around watching animals along the way, this is for you. If you like riding a Gondola, they have it here. Except on windy days. So check your weather first before anything else. It was just an ok experience for me.< /Text>

Great zoo for all ages! We come here often with our toddler to make the best of our membership and spend some family time together.
Only quip is if you have an outside drink they will not allow lids or straws but conveniently have both in their cafes.

**Update**
I’m glad that you are no longer using the lids and straws in the cafe keeping the plastic pollution in mind and for the safety of the animals. Next time I shall carry my reusable glass for my own drink.< /review>

<text>First time back during Covid.  We had a great morning.  All staff was very friendly.  Felt very comfortable.  Everyone had masks on and gave great social distance. Gondola cars are sanitized as one group gets out and before the next group gets in.  We see something different everytime we go.  Today we saw the jaguar eating breakfast, 2 camels laying on their sides right next to the veiwing area and the lions talking to each other.  Saw lots of other animals as well and had a great walk.  Thank you Oakland Zoo.</text>< date>

The Oakland Zoo spans some 100 acres and is home to over 750 native and exotic animals. I was not prepared for the hills, inclines and stairs to get in between exhibits. It is nice that there are live people guides to help direct you places and discuss the animals. Visitors can take a train ride and discover the Wild Australia section for emu and wallaroos. The African Savanna area is where the popular giraffes, zebras, and elephants are located.  There are two aerial rides.  The Sky Ride which you have to pay an extra $3 to ride and the gondolas that take visitors to the California Trail and visitor center. There is a panoramic San Francisco Bay overlook worth the wait in line and trip.  There is a lot to see and do at the Oakland Zoo, we did not get to everything this visit but I look forward to the next.< /text>

We liked it very much. It is big and will be even bigger next year. Allocate at least 3-4 hours, or even full day and plan ahead. In addition to animals, there is a small adventure park inside as well (for extra money)</text>

<Review>A great place for families to experience wildlife and the zoo is dedicated to conservation efforts. Also expect to get a good amount of exercise in with the hilly and expansive property. We chose this zoo for the elephants but loved all of it.<//Review><response>{'time': 1521576956657, 'text': 'Thank you for your support!'}</response>< rating>

<Text>Very impressed with this zoo! Lots of space, awesome exhibits, and incredible variety of animals. It was awesome how up close and personal you can be with the animals. Main thing that surprised us was how big it is. You can even take a ski lift to a upper level that is like a whole other zoo. Really cool place.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1582050737888, 'text': 'Thanks for the review!'}<//response><GmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was blown away by the views you get at this zoo! The gondolas give you views not only if the bay, but if the animals below you like the lions and the camels. There are many animals to see, and they seem to be well taken care of with lots of space. I also highly recommend coming for the light show during the winter holiday. They put a lot of effort into decorating the park, and it is a treat to take the rainbow light gondola at night.< /review>

Best large Zoo in the area for toddlers and older adults. Not as much walking as SF. The Gondola to the top is a new highlight.< /Review>

You have to be 18+ to ride the gondola or sky lift on your own unless you have an adult to ride with you, just thought y'all might want to know.</text>

A great zoo with a lot of different animals, spread out over a vast area. Memories as a kid involved the San Francisco Zoo, but I have to say that it is not match compared to the Oakland Zoo. We took the sky gondola to the aminal habitat area, and it was nice to be able to see wolves and other animals in such a large area, but still be observable by patrons. Some great veiws of the Bay as well. My son really enjoyed the different rides available.< /Review>

Our first visit ever was during Covid. They had setup hand sanitizers around doors and elevators. The volunteer docents were kind, friendly and very knowledgeable. My absolute favorite area is the gondola ride & California native animals. There is a beautiful view of the bay up there too.< /review>

The Oakland Zoo is an average Zoo.The species are neither very rare or exotic. Three lions, three tigers, four elephants, 6-7 Giraffes may not make it a world class. Amphibians, reptiles, Birds section was a total disappointment. Though crowded the entry fees and parking fee make it a costly affair. The visitors galleries need quantum improvement for visitors and little children  to have a good look at animals without disturbing  them. The Gandola and train ride can be enjoyed only if exotic varieties and large wild  animals are in plenty.<//text>

Best zoo in Bay Area!

The design of the exhibits makes it easier to spot animals more naturally. Although there are fences and glass and nets where required, but the experience is friendlier than other zoos I have visited. The size is perfect for completing the tour in a few hours satisfactorily, covering all exhibits.

First thing I would recommend is the Gondola ride, which takes you to the top level of the zoo. Complete that level exhibits and return to the lower level to enjoy the rest.

Food and drinks are allowed, which makes it easier for families to plan. There are plenty of benches and sheltered spots where you can relax and eat before moving on to the viewing.

Unfortunately, the petting zoo and a couple of exhibits were closed due to rainy weather.< /review>

<Review>The Oakland Zoo has done a phenomenal job of handling the COVID crisis! They have employees carrying hand sanitizer dispensers to provide to people in line. They are wiping down public surfaces with a spray disinfectant, and all areas are marked with clearly-visible six-foot designations. Absolutely mind-blowing how perfect their response is and how fully on board each employee is.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I really enjoyed the new gondola, and the new exhibits up top, especially the bald eagle exhibit, the Jaguar was amazing, and the mountain lions we're having a playful tumble.
The food at the new Cafe was good and reasonably priced. I really enjoy taking my children here and spending the day.< /review>

So much to see and do. You can have a different experience each time you go. Take the gondola to the upper zoo where you'll find a new set of animals to see, an outdoor and indoor play area for kids (including a very popular zipline), and a place to eat. Back down on lower zoo, there's a petting zoo, play area, places to picnic, and a place with rides for kids (train, carousel etc). We go all the time and never get bored.</review>

<text>Great park, great staff. Gets lots of use, but very well done. Some days the animals in the California trail area don't come out. Some days the grizzlies splash in the water inches away from you. Seems like a good deal for most of the animals.<//text>< rate>

Lots of fun kids had a great time staff was kind of rude but what would you expect surrounded by children minimum wage job why not blame the parents and hate us all I'm just saying some of the rudest Zoo staff I've ever experienced my family and I regularly go to the Sacramento Zoo and I've always been treated with respect and dignity I can't say that for my experience here I will return for the children but it's not the San Francisco Zoo</review>

Sorry my bad. I meant to leave a five-star! It's my first time writing reviews using this interface.

I meant to leave a five star, but not sure why it shows one. I did it on my phone using one hand. Really sorry for rating it as one-star by mistake. I have changed the rating from 1-star to 5-star.

We visited the zoo yesterday and the experience was super nice. Our daughter really loves being there. We got a yearly pass and plan to visit it more often. It is the best zoo (especially for kids) we have found in the bay area.</Text>

Visited during Covid-19 and felt like they did a good job with COVID protocol. I felt comfortable especially seeing that it was every other one for the gondolas and they would spray it down with sanitizer and also squirt some sanitizer in your hands prior to riding. Got to see some animals but but all. Hilly but nothing impossible as we went with a stroller and was fine.< /review>

Bought tickets for the date and time.  We drove 2 hours to the place.  We arrived, and today the zoo is open !!!  This mess!  Children are very upset and cry.  Why are you selling tickets online when the Zoo is closed?  I ask the head to resolve this issue, it is not very decent.</review>

<text>I've generally hated zoos.  Many zoos have that heartbreaking quality of visiting a prison.  The Oakland Zoo is a bit refreshing in that the animal habitats are generally large and well-appointed, the animals are mostly rescues, and the staff that I've interacted with are passionate and knowledgeable.  It's a nice, sprawling zoo.  Check out the Siamangs and the Flying Foxes (the world's largest fruit bats!).< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We LOVE the Oakland Zoo! This is an excellent place to take your kids, there is so much to see and do. The ticket prices are so reasonable for how much you are getting to see. There are so many exhibits to see and we really enjoyed the employees who shared lots of interesting facts about the different animals.

I would definitely recommend visiting the California Trail portion of the Zoo it is fantastic. The gondola ride is fantastic! The views are beautiful!

I would also recommend going in the morning, the animals are very active then and you might get to see some animal feedings as well.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1577987317704, 'text': "Thank you Audrey! We're happy you enjoyed your visit!"}< /response>< gmapID>

This is during Covid...but not entirely related to it.
Pros
-Easy in an out with buying tickets online!
-Nice to see large areas for the Animals!
-Clean bathrooms an areas
- Not gonna complain about exhibits being closed or animals not there etc. Life goes on lol.
-Taking the gondola is cool but read my con lol.

Cons however ....
-I get some food places need to be closed. But there wasn’t a single vender in the park. Maybe I missed the one right as you walk in. But through the entire park. Not a single food or drink station. I would have left sooner simply to get food, but just trying to walk to every attraction takes forever.

-Complete nightmare walking with a stroller or a child you have to carry. Pathways are uphill or down hill and most areas are a one way in one way out. This is not cause of Covid. It’s just how the path is. So you have to walk one way to see something to then walk back to get to something else. Poor planning on the layout for sure. Not a single flat area...

-The gondola ride was fun for the kids. A stroller takes up space. Everything was closed or empty but the bears an bison. The bison don’t do anything an the bear exhibit is the only exhibit worth it. There is also no shade. So unless you wana see a few bears. You can totally skip this. The restaurant is also closed. So no food.

-Not sure of the whole point of a parking pass as it wasn’t left in my car nor attached to my plate. So I hope that $10  goes to the zoo lol.

Over all it’s a one an done kinda thing. I enjoyed the Zoo an I am glad they were able to open back up. I didn’t mind the lack of exhibits etc. I minded the poor planning of the layout of Exhibits an the lack of food and drink.< /Review>

<Review>The Oakland Zoo has really come a long way!  Don't expect the caged monkeys in the parking lot! The Oakland Zoo has really taken steps to create a more "natural" environment.  The enclosed gandala up to the "California Area" is a nice alternative to the ski lift that's older than my parents. You don't have to pay zoo admission to get into the kiddie land, but be prepared to pay for ride tickets. In the end a zoo is a zoo. They really aren't that great for anyone and most of the animals are given literal trash to play with. Gatorade bottles do not appear in the wild to entertain anyone! My 2 year old enjoyed herself though, so whatever.< /Review>< rating>

This was so much fun. I went with my dad and younger brother. I loved seeing all the cute, hairy, and maybe a little scary animals. I liked the rides as well. I would definitely come back to the Oakland Zoo.<//Text>

<Text>A great place for dates and family outings! The animal husbandry is top quality, and the keepers are excellent at answering questions. The gondola ride up to the California Trail also shouldn't be missed. There's a cafe, plenty of native Californian creatures, and a playground for kids to exhaust themselves (if the walk hasn't done that already). I highly recommend the membership for any local parents, as you certainly get the full value quickly.< /Text>< Resp>

<review>This is small zoo but it's pretty nice. Besides the animals and education associated with zoos it has a great view of the bay from the tram. It also is easy to walk and very kid friendly. There is a small ride park for small children who may get bored easily, a petting area with goats, sheep, and livestock. The zoo is affordable and even food items are relatively cheap. This is great for small children or just to get away for a couple hours.</review>< Pictures>

We’ve been going there since our kid was 2 years old. He is 6 now and we have visited more than 8 times now. My kid loves this place. And they have done pretty good improvement over the time. My kids favorite place is the playground on the hill, loves the gondola ride.< /text>

<Review>This was my first and only zoo visited in USA, so I can't compare it with other zoo in USA but anyway, I enjoyed my visit there and also employees was very polite and kind. This zoo is pretty big compare it with zoo in Czechia.
There is a condola at no cost which can ride you up to California trail where you can buy some refreshments and look at some wild animals if you will have a luck.<//Review>< user>

*Australia area+train ride are extra
*need special key to listen to animal information
* gondola ride included (freaky but worth it)
*great views of animals
*playground in upper area...
It was our first time visiting this zoo and we went on a cloudy, on-and-off raining day so the  animals were all really active and fun to watch.
We got to be really close to a lot of the animals but there were many enclosures with nothing in them or where we couldn’t see anything (apes, wolves, plus others) which was disappointing.
We were also disappointed that we couldn’t see any of the Australian exhibit without paying extra to get on the train. There were a lot of us and we’d already paid a lot to get in to the zoo so we had to skip that.
There was not a lot of information on the signs throughout but there were little speaker boxes. We couldn’t figure out how to get the speaker boxes to work until we came across a key someone had dropped that made them play!!</text>

<Time>1553319982145<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Despite going on a weekend that was WAY too crowded (it took 30 minutes just to get off the freeway because the zoo parking lot was so backed up...pretty sure everyone was trying to use their Groupon coupons before they expired), it was a great spot. Beautiful location, good variety of animals, clean facilities. Our daughters loved it, especially seeing Simba and Mufasa (see pics). The only part we didn't do was the California area, but that's because it was in an area only accessible by gondola, and we didn't feel like waiting in the long line and leaving our double stroller with all of our stuff behind (because it wouldn't have fit on the gondola). We'll go back and see that when the girls are older. Overall, definitely worth checking out, though.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrKJvCns67e5TgwTQjkLuAhlpao0ezLhNT6Dw2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKO_3ndPL7JLsEQkXP4Tl2woToFCVp1-gkrBqI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPimNwIieMdA07QfQ88AkIjOJ66i0Ss_EBRL5zQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1553531731026, 'text': "Thanks for the review Matthew.

We haven't been there for a little while, so it was nice to see they have automated the parking lot entrance, and made some improvements to some of the enclosures. Always a great time, lots of friendly families, a real community feeling when you walk the pathways. We'll be back!!!< /Text>< Pics>

This is a great place to bring your kids. They have so many animals and if you come in the morning they are usually active. The gondola ride to the top is also very good as you get the view of the bay. And the ride is free! You'll get to see the bald eagle, wolves, jaguar, bears and mountain lions. This is a fun place for the entire family!< /text>

<text>My grandkids enjoyed the zoo.  It was our first time visiting.  There were some beautiful animals, such as the zebras, the elephants, the playful bears, the giraffs, etc.  The gondola ride was so nice.  It was such a wonderful place to go with the children.  Im very impressed at this zoo.  We will surely be back.< /text>< response>

Small place but can handle big crowds without making it look too packed .. parking was easy ... Lines move quickly ... Lots of strollers and families come here ... They had 4 tigers and you can usually spot them due to the multiple openings for the public to view around the cages<//Review>< pics>

Not only is the zoo an amazing place to wander through and see how well the animals are cared for in the most natural habitat they can provide. The zoo also does a lot of amazing work for Animals off site and in other countries. It's so worth being a member.</text>

Got there at 9 and the line was forming. When we got in most of the animals where still hiding. Groupon had a family pack which helped with the price. Very diverse zoo not like Sacramento zoo. Worth the money and the drive. Just wish we could have seen all the animals< /text>

The Oakland Zoo is a beautiful zoo, and riding the gondola to see rest of the park (California Trail ) and the views is a must! It's nice to see a lot of the animals in large areas and they all appear to be very happy. It's a great place for kids and families. We packed a lunch and had a little picnic while being there, highly recommended over waiting in line for lunch. Parking can be a bit chaotic, so I would recommend going during the time they first open, or a few hours later when people start leaving. We went on a cold day, so we weren't able to see the bears but maybe next time!</review>

Very big zoo with lots of animals. Gondola ride was very fun, once you go up the hill the animals there like wolfs are hard to find or see as live a big area. We liked the gift shop, it has lot of stuffed wild animals.</text>

Loads of animals to see. Parking at the lower entrance might be easier if you can find a spot. Spots near the main entrance are taken quickly. Also,  be warned that the road you take up to the main entrance sometimes becomes a one way street so you might have to take a different route down.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1582051359975, 'text': 'Thanks Patrick for the detailed review!'}</response><GmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

What a great place for a weekend gateway with family and friends. All the animals are very healthy and well managed. They also have very friendly staff around, and a well mix of mammals, reptiles and birds, and of course bugs. The only downside is the parking space constraints , and the place can get really busy over weekend and expect to spend quite sometime to find parking spot.</text>

Love, love, love the holiday lights at the Oakland Zoo. Took the grandkids and they were mesmerized. Sorry I didn't take good photos - I was entranced as well. Animals are asleep for the night but the lights are great and the gondola ride up the "hill" was fabulous. It was only $12.00. A must see for the holidays.< /Text>

This is our second time at the zoo after a few years. Our first experience was not so great but this time around we had a great time. Getting there early was the key as the animals were more out and about rather than hiding in the shade.

Also the gondola ride to California trail was pretty cool with bears and bison on display. In addition a nice little play area for the kids. Kids and us had a great time, signed up for the annual membership!!!<//review>

Great zoo! It complements the SF Zoo nicely given some different animals. Oakland notably has elephants, baboons gibbons, buffalo camels, alligators and a jaguar. The skylift ride, gondola and kids ride park are nice additional attractions for kids and the whole family. Highly recommend the family membership packages which are great deals - the family membership we got cost a lot less than two visits.</review>

Lots of land for the animals. They have elephants which many zoos nowadays no longer keep. New section via gondola ride has native animals as well as a playground. Kiddie rides at Adventure Landing are fun but cost extra. Free admission to that section. Train ride is great.<//review>

<Text>Compassionate staff! My 15 month old daughter fell and bumped her head while we were getting a bite to eat at the top on the gondola ride. The staff quickly came over and asked if she was ok, they even went out of their way to make a ice pack. They also gave her a fruit cut free. Thanks for your professionalism!< /Text></record>

<text>I felt as if the zoo was so spread out and not a lot of animals. I felt as if they put play ground in between the animals to make the park look bigger. The restaurant food was dry and over priced. I wont be going back.<//text>< Pics>

This was fantastic! Free parking was an unexpected surprise. We had a blast of a FUN workout, as we strolled through the lighted Zoo. There was something for everyone's interests.
The light show was fun to watch as the lights changed and seemed to dance with the Christmas music. The Christmas song choices were just as diverse as the attractions throughout the Zoo.
I do recommend this holiday Zoo Lights show for your Christmas, to do list! And, also...
Just remember to remove your plastic lids on your soft drinks/coffee cups before entering. Their not allowed.
Enjoy, Merry Christmas World!
Thanks Oakland Zoo!!<//review>

The employees were all friendly.  The animals were all beautiful.  And I loved the  hand written ‘side notes’ on the exhibits.  I will definitely visit again.  And I’m from San Diego.< /text>

This is a great family outing and now it opens at 9:30 on Sundays! Much better. We usually stay for 3 hours and do one section. The gondola and North American wildlife section is awesome.</review>

<rating>4< /rating><text>The docents are what gives this zoo a 4. They are very knowledgeable and I learned a few new cool  things about chimpanzees. The animals rank a 3 out of 5. Some of them were in hiding, like the sun bears. Of course the food and drink were overpriced. Be prepared to do a lot of uphill walking. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. The ride in the gondola was nice.<//text>< Pics>

This is a nice Zoo. Not the best I've been to. Very hilly... We brought a wagon...I won't be bringing that again! Some of the animal enclosures are small. Excited to ride the new gondola.< /Review>

<text>Parking is absolutely outrageous on the weekends. Literally took 45 minutes to park. We are members and there is no members line to enter the zoo so you wait in line with everyone buying tickets. They had to close the gondola because so many people were at the top. During the week it is a great zoo with a lot to see and do. I just recommend not going on the weekends. They also do not serve alcohol which the SF zoo does.</text></record></dataset><record>

Was disappointing. From being charged 10.00 to park on a lawn Then another 48.00 for the exhibits.
We saw garbage in the enclosures and the gondola was closed due to wind. They should have offered a discount at admission.
Our family visits zoos all over the state San Diego, SF, Sacramento etc this zoo just did not meet our expectations.</Review>

<Review>Smaller zoo so nice to explore for a few hours.  Good for kids.  Enjoyed the gondola ride to the cafe and animal exhibits at the top of the hill.  Kids liked the little amusement park rides next to the main entrance.</Review>< Pics>

Gandola ride fare is included in ticket and is an interesting ride. Ample parking space and friendly staff. Variety of items to shop.<//review>< pictures>

We’ve been to the other zoos in the Bay Area and Sac and Oakland is our favorite. It is mapped out very well and we love how it is designed for families. We don’t mind driving a bit further to go. The little ride park is fun the the kids and we’ve been members for years now.<//review>

A bit pricey of course, and parking can be a pain but overall a very positive experience for people of any age. Its very well kept and showcases a plethora of different animals. Its worth the ticket so long as you enjoy your time spent there.<//review>

This was our first time and it was nice. Not a lot of animals to be seen, but a lot of walking to be had. We took the gondola to the top of the zoo and the view was amazing. We had lunch at the cafe near the zoo entrance and it was decent. However our garlic fries came in a tub of oil and were inedible at the bottom. FYI, there’s not much parking so if you arrive later in the day you’ll be forced to park down a long, steep hill.</text>

It's a fantastic zoo. They don't have as many different animals as other zoo's, but I appreciate the fact that they give the animals large enclosures with lots of amenities like toys, swings, balls and water features. The new California section at the top of an amazing gondola ride is with the price of admission by itself.< /text>

Zoo itself is great but customer service is non existent. Employees don't appear all that excited to be there and don't appear to care about customers. This could have easily been a 5 star review if it wasn't for the customer service issues I encountered< /Review>

This place was quite large. Definitely worth the admission price of $20. BE SURE TO GO EARLY! If you don't you won't get to see everything! Be prepared to be walking up & down a lot of hills...great exercise. I had a great time.<//review>

Decent sized zoo with lots of animals to look at. Very hilly so a good workout for the legs while with the family. I had to dock a point for the gondola ride to access the newest part of the zoo. Not a fan of heights. Also has a mini amusement park with rides for the kids. Food is expensive so bring your own.</Review>

Really nice zoo where you can get very close to the animals.  We spoke to several zoo staff and it's obvious that they love the animals and care very much about the zoo.<//Review>

This zoo is beautiful and great to visit year round. There is a ton of shade on hot summer days and a great new play area for kids in the new California Trail area. They have lots of benches to rest while you view the animals and several spots to eat if you bring your own picnic lunch. Food and rides at the zoo are pricey but the proceeds all go back into the zoo and their many charities so totally worth it.</text>

I really don't like the ideas of animals being locked up for our entertainment , however I noticed that the animals here are happy and active.  They don't show any sings of mistreatment.  Fair priced and safe for all ages.<//text>

AMAZING!!!!! Sooo incredible!!! The condors were breath taking, yes California Condors,  rescued and on exhibit...  the wolves were so cool and the amount of space the Oakland zoo gives them makes you really feel they have the animals well being as their first priority!!!!  And I haven't even mentioned the Grizzlies... or the mountain lions... and the gondola up, some times we just ride that up and down and up.... congrats to the zoo a GREAT JOB!!!!<//review>

After you buy tickets online you still should wait in line for a long time to print it out as they can't scan from your screen. BTW overall experience was good. Very nice place with many different animals. Lots places to have rest and hide from sun. Very nice California trail route. Thank you.<//Text>

<review>Always a favorite, the recent upgrades finally make this a truly full day place. Awesome children's area with special exhibits [kid sized doors!] and a cool goat petting zoo. Food is decent and a better value than similar institutions. If you can, take the free gondola and eat at the cafe with a view at the top - totally worth it.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Oakland Zoo strives to have leading quality care for our animals and provide them with the best living situations as possible.\n\nTheir habitat (along with giraffes, tigers, and others) are in our plans for renovation within the coming years.\n\nOur current chimpanzee habitat was built in the early 90’s but the Animal Care Staff has provided many changes to their environment to provide physical and mental stimulation. The climbing structures for example, are ways for the chimpanzees to be more engaged with their environment.  We are currently assessing how to increase the behavioral diversity of our enrichment program as well as looking at ways to increase the amount of time the chimps are occupied with elements in their environment.\n\nWe're so happy to hear that you loved the zoo and hope you come back to visit."}</response>
< Review>
I've never been to the San Diego zoo which by most accounts is the best zoo in the country but I have been to several others and this is by far the best zoo I've ever been to. I went in with high expectations and I was not let down. What an incredible experience, it seems a lot of thought was put into this zoo and the only complaint I have is that while most of the enclosures seem appropriate to the animals inside, the chimpanzee enclosure seems way to small for them, especially considering all the open space not far away that could be used to expand the chimp enclosure.<//Review>

<Text>Kids love it, especially the gondola. Lots of fun. Food is overpriced and not the best service at the restaurant, girl employee rude. We will bring our own sandwhiches next time. We bring our kids at least once a year. If we have a little extra time we let them get on a couple of rides next door.</Text><rating>5< /rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

<review>I have so many memories that have been here as a young adult with friends, then my family as the children grew up, and then now a good time with our grandchildren. the only drawback for me now is the hills just get to my knees. The layout and animal habits are great. The new Californian area is a work in progress but really cool<//review>< Pics>

Went at around 9am and the animals were very active and appeared to be enjoying themselves. The black bears in particular were really fun to watch.<//review>< Pics>

<text>It was great! The workers were helpful & the animals were visible. We got to hear a lion roar and see a wolf, even with the wolf exhibit being closed due to new born pups. It was just right for a spring afternoon. Wish we lived closer so we could go more often.<//text>< Pics>

Looking for the best views in the Bay Area? Definitely walk the Trail up to the Bison area and bears, the tram will take you up there.btw, have your camera ready for some serious panoramic photos.. gorgeous green area. Never gets old, done it thousand times and you always see some new things, also take rainboots for the kiddos, there is a super fun creek at the play area and would be a must to play in it.
Also an extra change of clothes, they will get wet..but happy at the end of the day. 👍🏼☺️
win-win.< /Review>

I love this place so much more since the California addition. We got a family Membership just to ride the gondola up top. The kids have spent over an hour just up there exploring. It's still a bit nostalgic, too so I'm glad I can share this place with my kids.< /Text>

Great zoo with lots of animals as well as fun rides. Plenty of places to stop and get a snack. Sort of expensive but I guess that's not surprising.<//text>

<Review>Any zoo gets a 4+ rating from me. This zoo is good, I like the animals, it's not too big and can take less than 3 hrs to go around even if very slowly. The air chair ride is just $3 but is very nice. The zoo is dry though in terms of activities as compared to really good ones but good place nevertheless. Can get crowded.</Review>< pictures>

Very nice zoo. Must take a tram to get to the area where there are animals that can be found in California. Unfortunately, except for a very brief glimpse of a wolf through some bushes, no black or grizzly bears were visible. The only sight of the mountain lions was a paw and a tail as they take advantage of the hammocks in their enclosures. Good view of the camels and elands and many other animals.< /Review>

The gondola is great and gives you an amazing view over the bay area. On a clear day you can even see the Golden Gate Bridge. Most animals have decent amount of space, but some cages are a bit antiquated. Parking and a confusing layout are the main downsides of this zoo.<//Text>

Perfect size zoo for my two year old. We had a really great time watching the bears. We got there on a Saturday at 11AM. There was a long line to wait for the parking lot entry. The lot was full, and we were instructed to park alongside the curb driving up to the lot. We got on the Gondola first which I highly suggest for two reasons. 1) the line is short, and 2) the other park is small. There's also  The California Wilds Playground on that side which has a sandpit, a small Creek for littles to stick their toes in, a Zipline, a small tunnel and a slide. We then came back to the main park and finished our visit there.<//Text>

It was enchanting to see the animals again and watch the kids interact with the exhibits. They all had a blast and so did I! This place is so special to me and so many of the folks around me. I feel extremely lucky to have this incredible resource in my neighborhood, and it’s one of the gems of the Bay Area. 💖< /Text>< response>

< Review>
Location on a hill in Oakland off I580.
It should be arguably the best zoo in Bay Area and nearby.
Very reasonably priced, it offers a free Gondola ride up the mountain ( not to be missed) too!!
With our family of four and with 2 kids, we were able to experience 80% of the zoo in 4 hours. We did not do the other sky ride ( paid service). A paid train trip also adds to excitement but it is a very  short ride.
There are about four rides ( carousel, plane, etc) which are OK priced at train station.
It has a reasonable collection of animals and most impressive to us were the primates. The park has lot of birds out of cage and in the wild.  For bird photography, I found ample opportunities. Park has decent food options and several picnic areas.
Overall a good half day trip. Since there are activities too other than exhibits, you could plan multiple trips in the year.<//Review>

It's a great zoo to take your children there's lots to see. I loved that you can see the animals up close. The guides are very informative and helpful. Just be aware that there is a lot of walking and hills!  Bring good comfortable walking shoes. Oh! I do wish there were more restroom  stalls in some of the restrooms, especially when there are multiple schools on field trips. Lines can get very long.</review>

<review>Such an amazing experience. The animals are well cared for, which is nice to see. The animals are varied and interesting, with good sized, appropriate habitats. Otters, alligator, bats, African animals, and even jaguars and bears. They have this gondola to take visitors to the "California" expanse. Staff is helpful and friendly. Restrooms are well spaced, common and easily accessible. Ramps for wheelchair or stroller access along the exhibits. You will enjoy!</review>< pictures>

Great zoo! I went here as a kid and just returned at more than 20 years. They continue to grow and improve in a way that provides as good a living situation for the animals as possible. The only negatives were the high prices for unhealthy food and the general unenthusiasm of many staff members.<//text>

My family and I enjoyed our time at the Oakland Zoo. We are regulars at the SF zoo and I will now be coming here instead. The area is a little smaller but so much more to see. You get up close and personal with a lot of these animals and is much more interactive than SF. We will definitely be coming back.</review>

This priceless last piece of quiet, unspoiled open space in the Oakland hills has been replaced with a restaurant and animal cages,  denuding the meadows and killing the oaks and even locally rare native plants. The buildings, views, and animal displays are attractive and informative. It's just hard to enjoy them understanding the cost to Oakland's native ecosystems.< /text>

{'time': 1561566811828, 'text': "Hi Roy. We understand your concern but with the building of California Trail we actually made sure to preserve a lot of the native fauna and flora. Our elevated pathways help preserve the local grassland, marine chaparral, and oak woodland. We made sure to build our aviaries and habitats high enough that we wouldn't have to cut down the trees. We have set up trap cams that also monitor all local wildlife around the zoo. We hear you and share your concern and want to assure you we are helping preserve the local fauna and flora. Thank you for leaving this review. If you would like to discuss more, please email web@oaklandzoo.org ."}</response>

Once the California Trail section opens in Summer 2018, it will basically double the size of the park.  On busy days and weekends, the walkways can feel tight.  Food is overpriced, so pack a lunch.< /review>< resp>

<text>If you like the zoo the Oakland zoo is great. I mean it's no San Diego zoo, but it's still pretty big. There's a gondala you can ride to the American wilderness section of the park, that's pretty cool.

If you have to choose between Oakland and SF for zoos, definitely choose Oakland.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Always love the Oakland zoo.  The California exhibit is beautiful, with views of the whole bay area from the gondola ride, and we got to see the wolves eating with their half-grown cubs.  The zoo has tons of enrichment for the animals, and it has a lot of interactive areas for children.  There's also a carnival ride area, eateries and snacks for sale.</Text><GmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa<//GmapID>< pics>

Decent collection of animals this family friendly zoo is a fun place to visit, one should  miss newly installed gandola ride to the other extended part of zoo. Make sure to check for windy weather to avoid missing gandola and sky ride.<//review>

<text>Kids really liked the zoo. The zoo has a friendly atmosphere and the staff are very courteous and helpful. It is great place and we plan on definitely going again. I didn't give 5 stars because I felt the train ride to the "Australian section" wasn't worth the time standing in line or the fare cost. The train ride itself was fun however it was too short and the Australian attraction itself was few and far and in between.</text><user>106216844673894285570< /user>< Rate>

Compared to the zoo we have been to in the past it feels that we were able to be much closer to the animals here in oakland. California also has natural vegetation that can make for some pretty cool enclosures for the animals. The gondola was our sons favorite part though.

Love the zoo! We are members and braved the crowds yesterday to tak our family there. The new gondola was packed, 20 minute lines, but orderly and effecient. A great festive vibe! Views of the Bay were incredible!

I loved this zoo. Their new attraction with the bears, wolf family, restaurant and ther high point view was absolutley wonderful to experience. It's actually better than the San Francisco zoo.
There was one negative, we had to park at the exit gates, walk all the way up the hill and still pay for parking. Some people can handle a hike but, I couldn't. I was so exhausted and out of breathe. It was horrible. Then when we finally got to the top there was actually, parking in the parking area.< /review>

New California trail up at the top of the gondola is definitely worth checking out. I think the only animals I couldn't spot were the wolves, Grizzlies and mountain lion. They're very well staffed and have knowledgeable zookeepers ready to answer questions. There is a new habitarium up there too, next to the visitor center, also worth a gander, especially if you have kids.<//Review>

Enjoyed our day! Got tons of exercise! Very nice layout and wonderful areas for the little ones. Next time will definitely bring our basket of goodies and water/sodas. $5 for a can of soda is a bit much. Previous reviews stated parking is free?? Not so. Admission prices were also misquoted. All in all it was a beautiful day spent in the animal kingdom!< /review>

My wife and I were looking at the Elephants and these two guys driving around on a golf cart came and yelled at us saying the zoo was closed however on a positive note the lady selling tickets at the front entrance this past Sunday was very nice.  We think some of your people need to take a lesson in politeness to guests.  We would have been happy to leave.  Your employees don't need to be rude.</Review>

Beautiful ZOO, beautiful setting.The animals have nice big place to live and they looked happy. We picked hot day for our visit so the ZOO was not very crowded.
We loved the little Safari Adventure Train and the Gondola. We will be coming back for sure.<//review>

Over crowded.
They have sold too many memberships without keeping track of how many people will come on a daily basis.
Even for members it’s hard to find parking or get a decent look at any animals.

Rides are mostly out of order.
Most employees are not motivated to help people. They are just giving rude answers like ‘don’t ask me why the ride is down for 3 months. I m not the CEO’.

Food is pathetic. Barely anything is fresh< /Text>

<review>The zoo itself is awesome. The kids loved it. The new gondola lift is really great. It is fast, quiet and you get to see absolutely beautiful scenery view of the entire Bay Area while you ride you ride up and back down to and from the top. At the top are all of the new exhibits. California mountain lion was only inches away.  The zoo is a large area and the paths are fun to walk through.

Way better than the San Francisco zoo, and half the price. You can spend hours here, especially with little ones. They just opened a whole new section of wild animals that you can go see with a gondola ride to the top of the mountain. I'm a member here, and the price wasn't bad at all. Three visits and it already paid for itself. You can bring in your own food to save on costs, and they even have a baby amusement park for little ones!<//Review>

Although it's a small zoo, me and my daughter had a blast and spent the whole day seeing all the animals and had some down time for other activities like their little rides for kids! I think I had more fun tho 😂<//review>

It's a bigger place than you think and the variety of animals is diverse. The food is above average and the gondolas are brand new for easy transport. There are free passes for San Francisco residents and library card holders on some days which can make traffic hectic.  Highly recommended if you avoid those days!<//text>< Pics>

I love the Oakland Zoo.  They have a wide variety of animals.  The new California Trail is amazing!  Today I saw the two adult wolves and one of the wolf pups.  The food in the restaurant at the top of the zoo is expensive though good.  The view from the top is worth the high price of food.<//Text>

< Review>
The large mamas are great! The presentation is  spacious, wide open and all the animals are active in front of people. One of the best in urban zoos. The facilities are very old and poor. Restrooms are dark and dirty. Not enough cafe and restaurants. Restaurants are very expensive, better to bring your own food. The membership seems very reasonably priced and well worth it, considering the parking is included.</Review>

My 3 year old loves this place. We’ve been several times.  The first time the gondola to the bears and upper region of the zoo was closed, and the other times the ride on the gondola to or from that upper region of the zoo took a very long time.  We waited in line to ride back on the gondola for over an hour.  I would recommend that they create a foot path to be able to walk there.</text>

<Text>Great place for a family outing. The gondola ride up the hill gives a spectacular view of the bay area. There are lots of playgrounds, activities and exhibits to entertain and educate the little ones - and adults. Food on the cafeteria on top of the hill was better than expected. Lines can get long for food or rides on weekends. Oh yeah...and the animals are also lots of fun in this place. :)<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Overall great zoo! Nice and spacious, lots of little spots for tots to play such as, the lily pad walk, and otter slide by the crocs, and the spider web by the Bug House. Good selection of food at the cafe. Cost was a little high, however, it goes to a worthy cause so I would expect to pay a little more. Staff were all very nice and informative. Bears were a big hit and the giraffes. Loved the gondola ride up to the top.</Review>

<review>Put on your walking shoes, it's a big zoo and there's plenty of walking.  Since they opened up a new section, it gets pretty crazy busy here on the weekends.  It got a fun free ride of the gondola.  The kids will love the ride and adults will love the views.  There's plenty of animals to see.  Make sure you save some time for the new playground and pack a lunch because you'll be here for awhile.  If you have time, there's some carnival rides right outside of the zoo but it cost extra.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I thought it cost to much for what you get and isn't affordable for many families.  Would like to see it be a lower price so everyone could enjoy.< /review><time>1556510495734< /time></record></dataset><record>

Nice place to spend time with your family and friends. Be ready to walk because this place is huge. The exhibit is huge and very safe, be careful with the chimps they're very smart they sometimes throw feces at people who dare to get too close and sometimes hit bystanders. You're warned. They have bears, monkeys, chimps, hyenas, crocodiles, lemurs, elephants, camels, turtles, flamingos, reptiles, insects, jirafs,etc. They have children activities, a little museum elevator, handicap ramps, restrooms, restaurants, aereal gondolas a little train ride, mechanic rides, penny press machines and a gift shop.< /review>

< Review>
We love this zoo.  Unfortunately,  today the weather was not conducive to many of the animals being out and about.  Still, there were many that were and we were able to get very close since it wasn't crowded. All in all,  it ended up being a memorable day with the otters showing off their water aerobic skills the lions sending us off with astounding roars.</Review>

Many zoos make me sad. Viewing caged animals isn’t on my top ten list. The Oakland Zoo is an exception, the animal habitats are spacious and clearly the zoo has made an effort to recreate the natural habitats of each animal. The new California exhibit is wonderful, the gondola ride to the exhibit has stunning views of the entire San Francisco Bay, it’s a not to miss experience!< /Review>

It is such a blessing to have a zoo so close to home. We visit it at least a couple of times a year. Even on very crowded days (e.g. when schools have a vacation), it doesn't seem to get crowded inside the zoo. The gondola ride is lovely.< /review>

I have enjoyed going to this zoo for many years. Unlike some zoos, the enclosures are sufficient in size with appropriately engaging features for the animals. The zoo is in the Oakland Hills and has many scenic overlooks throughout the grounds.<//review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>It's a nice enough zoo, lots to see, though it seems every time I go, there is SOMETHING that is closed.
The thing to keep in mind is that, being the SF Bay area, it's expensive, about $110 for a family of four just to get in.  Then about $50-70 for lunch. And if you want to ride the train or buy any souvenirs, a visit will be over $200 total.< /review><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Very nice place for kids and family...  Lot of animals like giraffe,  elephant,  black bear, grizzly,  fox etc.  The best part is that park has gondola ride inside which takes to the mountain top ... You can see the entire Oakland from the top.  We went there for an hour before the park closes so we couldn't cover all the areas...  To cover all the areas at least keep 4 to 5 hours.  Also go early morning or after the lunch time as most animals (except humans) sleep in the afternoon.<//Text>

This zoo is special, and has its own unique style. With its two sky rides, and different animals, this place is very good for a family to just walk around. You could spend 5 hours there, and not even realize it. The food on the mountain is very good, but the only problem is that there is not enough tables.< /Text>

Oakland zoo is great. Get there early and take the gondola to the top to see pumas and bears, then play on the playground.  Hit some rides on the way out.<//review>

< Review>
The Oakland Zoo lights was really fun, more for younger kids I would think then older. We ride the gondola up to the new restaurant at the top of the hill and everything was great with the exception of one rude girl who was working there, who  mouthed off about the fact that she wanted to get off shift, didn't want to do anything because they were ready to close, and she was incredibly rude to her coworkers as well as guests. If she wouldn't have continued to complain as loudly as you possibly could is stomping around behind the counter and out in the area where the guests eat that would have been great< /Review>

A really awesome experience.  A wide variety of animals.  First zoo we've been to since moving to cali.  This beat our expectations of a park.  They have a bunch of rides toddlers can go on. I was surprised my 2 year old son was able to go on a few.  This place was really worth it.< /text>

Our family LOVES it here. We bought our daughter a season pass for her birthday and we use it often. Lots of walking. They have a new Gondola with new animals. My daughter's favorite to do before we leave is ride all the rides in the Family Fun area. Wish those were part of the membership. Overall a great place to spend the day with the family.</Review>

<Review>The zoo has undergone many improvements over the years.  Recently it has added a section on California animals.  The plus side is that it is well laid out, the animals are in natural habitats (which means that they can be really hard to see, they blend in to the grasses, hills, and trees) ...so be prepared to stand around and look for awhile.  This area is only accessible by an overhead cable car.  The plus of this is that it has great views and is fun.  The disadvantage is that the lines can get rather long, especially on Fridays in the summer.
The animal exhibits are well done and many are natural, elephants have hills, lions really really blend into the hillside.
The children's area has lots of play structures to tire the kids out, as well as child oriented animal exhibits (the otters are really popular.)
A good way to spend a day with the family.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1565631560544, 'text': 'Thanks for the detailed review'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We love visiting the animals with our daughter. It's small enough to see everything in 2-3 hours but large enough to have a good variety of animals, which are well cared for. The gondola is amazing, with spectacular views of the bay, and the new California Trail is beautiful.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1551287175457, 'text': 'Thanks for the review!'}<//response>< gmapID>

Very well maintained zoo and not too far. Worth spending a good portion of the day here. There are very few food options in "The Landing Cafe" and it is pricey, but it is better than going hungry. Get there early to avoid the long wait to find parking.< /review>

<Review>Good place for very young kids, ages 3-6. I liked the sea otters the most as well as the gondola ride. I still haven't checked out the new upper portion of the zoo or the reptile house, and will save those for a later date. I did thoroughly appreciate the layout of the zoo and how much space the animals were given. They out a lot of thought into keeping the animals happy. My review is mainly for the membership. This membership is only worth it if you have a family with very young children and you live close to the zoo. I thought it was a well-thought out scam that the amount paid for parking on the day you buy your membership isn't applied towards your membership (since you get free parking with membership) instead you can either apply that amount towards the few dinky rides outside of the zoo or just eat the cost. It is partially my fault for buying a membership my first time at the zoo, without reading further into the consequences of buying a membership.

I am an auntie to about a million children, I have no children of my own, and thought to use the membership to bring my various comadres and their kids to the zoo so we could all spend the day together. I was annoyed that I had to buy the more expensive family plus membership (rather than the regular family), since you have to name both adults, and I needed a membership that would allow myself, 1 adult guest, and several child guests. If I weren't already there with a gaggle of kids, and if I hadn't already paid for parking, I would have just left and not bought the membership.

If you're going to buy a new membership, I would suggest buying the membership online first to avoid the additional cost of paying for parking or just take the bus there.</Review></record>

<review>The good:  I really appreciated the wide variety of animals and exhibits that were on display when I visited, and the zoo's commitment to conservation work and animal welfare seems genuine.  I especially appreciate how they are working with the Siksika/Blackfoot nation to reintroduce wild bison, their rehabilitation of injured and orphaned animals, as well as providing a home for animals who were illegally bought as a pets.

The bad:  I came here with a friend who needed to use a wheelchair, and I was astonished at not only how inaccessible huge areas of the park are to people with disabilities but also how poorly information about accessibility was communicated.  There are wheelchairs available for rent, but they cost $15 (not including a $20 refundable deposit).  Similar museums either charge nothing aside from a deposit or just ask for a photo ID as a security measure.  Even though the wheelchair costs $15 to rent, there is only one size available and it is hard to maneuver.  The only reason it was usable to my friend is because I was available to push it.  Because the wheelchair has non-removable sides, it was very difficult to self-propel even on flat surfaces.  It was completely impossible to self-propel uphill, which is a large portion of the park.  Additionally, many areas of the park are completely inaccessible to non-ambulatory wheelchair users.  My friend was able to walk a short distance with a cane to visit these areas, but not everyone who uses a wheelchair is able to do this.  Given the large number of signs available to orient visitors, it is shocking to me there is no information about which paths might be most accessible, where elevators to avoid stairs could be found, or cautionary information about paths that might have slopes that would be difficult for people with mobility-related disabilities.  The information provided about storing and maneuvering the park with a stroller was far more comprehensive than the instructions provided to individuals in wheelchairs.  I understand that the zoo was started before the ADA, but many of these fixes are relatively simple (e.g., adding informative signage, adding buttons to automatically open doors, installing wider doors).  Given all of these issues relating to navigating around the park, the very least the managers could do is provide wheelchairs for free conditional on providing a security deposit or leaving an ID card.  Other local museums provide wheelchairs for free, and a $35 initial payment is excessive in light of the $24 admission fee that is charged for entering the zoo.<//review>< Date>

It was going to be a quick family trip, but we ended up making a day of it, ~ 4.5 hours at the zoo. For being on a very busy day, it didn't feel incredibly crowded, besides busy, but easy parking, when we rolled up at noon. There was a stacked line for the adventure landing train, $3.50 / person, but we timed everything else really well. If you have to choose, the take flight lift at $3 / person is a much better experience for animal viewing and relaxing than the train. The gondolas are free, and fast!, to take you to the new, and pretty big, area. We went to the new area with the zoo open for another hour and had plenty of time including playing at the playground up there.< /text>

Nice place for a simple get a way for the family or even possibly a first date good food place spread out and a lot of snack shack all decently priced.  This is not a huge zoo but the animals seemed well kept all the staff seemed very friendly.  Parking can be a challenge at times and they do not always charge a parking fee which was a nice surprise.</Text>

We loved the zoo. Animals are well kept in spacious areas. The gondola is great. The only issue we had is that you need to pay 3 dollars per person to hop on a train to go and see the Australia section. We could not find a trail to walk there. That should included in the entrance fee.<//text>

This zoo is medium to small. They are expanding which will be a nice addition once done. I had a map and there are signs but I felt they could do a better job helping people figure out where they are and where to go. Park people I interacted with were polite but not overly friendly. Overall a great zoo and would definitely visit again. My only complaint is the website showed animals that are part of the upcoming addition and not currently available so it was misleading.< /Text>

The zoo and animals are pretty nice and it was fun. The grizzly bears in particular were a lot of fun. The animals were relatively active. We were there at 3pm. The reason I gave it three stars is that they kicked us all out in the evening and then we had to pay a lot to come back in for zoo lights. If that's how they want to do it, it's fine, but the zoo lights themselves were just a huge disappointment. They were not nice at all. I've see other zoo lights and lights in the city and this was not at all worth admission. The main attraction, the gondola ride was also just okay.<//text>

This zoo is also a conservatory which means that they aren't just caging animals. They are giving them homes. It feels natural and their animals all look healthy and happy. For a moment, I was in the African Savannah. Tropical Rainforest and California Trail.<//review>

The zoo is super great. Free Gandola ride... The new addition "California trait" is very nice. It has nice restaurant, play ground for kids . Able to watch the bear playing in water in really close distance.  The children zoo is another highlight of the  zoo. My kid spend 2 hours there easily. Also do not miss the animal feeding event. We spend the whole day there. We were thinking the zoo is small and 3 hours max. But we were so wrong. Definitely coming back again. We will join the membership if we live closer by. The membership is actually a great deal for entire family which also include parking. We particularly love to see Elephant and how they are eating. Very amazing.<//Review>

<review>This zoo and it's staff are great. They have tons of animals and exhibits to look at, and plenty of kind and knowledgeable staff members. I only wish that they were able to have more of their stalls open for snacks and souvenirs. It seemed like most of the stalls away from the front of the park were not open. It could be because it's winter though. Great zoo though, and the keepers were feeding animals throughout the day, so it was fun to be able to actually see some active animals.</review>< pics>

I've been to quite a few zoos over many states and even in different countries, and I have to say the Oakland Zoo is my favorite. The animals just seem happy. I always have good sightings of lions, tigers, elephants, hyenas, and lemurs. Now, with the new California Trail it's even better. I was so impressed on our recent visit about the areas for the grizzly bears, mountain lions, wolves, jaguar, and bison. I love how the walkways at this Zoo wind around with all the trees and through the hillsides. It never seems crowded because it's so spread out. There really is something for everyone at this zoo, highly recommended.<//Text>

It's definitely a work out. I was sweating in my work clothes. Someone with mobility issues wouldn't do well. Other than the work out trekking up all the inclines though,  its a beautiful zoo. You have to ride the gondola up to the California trail. It's a little scary but totally worth it.<//text>

The zoo has all the major species one expects at a zoo.  They are in natural settings, easy to see.  There is a path that takes us from one to another in about a 2 mile circle.  There are docents everywhere to explain about the animals.  The new CA Path is very interesting.  There are rides for kids.<//text>

Great place to take the family.  This place could use more interaction with animals or keepers walking talking to people on a regular. There was a magic show, which was good for little kids but not zoo related. Best part was the gondola. Could see some animals but mostly the ride was just exciting because you could see everything quick and fun.<//review>

<Review>Our family love this place so much that this is the second year of our annual pass. We usually go straight to the newer half of the zoo by taking the skyline. Afterwards there is a good noodle spot called Noodles Pho Me in San Leandro that's very close. Kids always enjoy this route.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Overall pretty great. There is quite a variety of animals to see.Good kids play area, a train and a petting yard.If you have young kids who need to be in stroller wear your sneakers because going up uphill was quite an excercise while pushing. Didnt get to try the food places so can't speak on it. I live 15 mins away from the zoo so its convenient for me. Parking  was about $10 per vehicle. Tickets are $25 for adults,  $20 per children. Gondola rides looked nice hope to try them next time.< /text>

I highly recommended volunteering at the Zoo if you are looking for a Community Service activity. The Tram provided spectacular views.< /Review>

Haven't been for years. Came back to a new ride the Gondola. It brings you up to the other side of the zoo, to observe 3 more animals, coyotes (along with new members of the family) grizzly bears and bisons. My little one is really amazed!!! Very clean place as well.</review>

<text>The zoo overall was showing well on the surface. The California exhibit was a bit disappointing after all of the media hype. The black bear enclosure was the only one that showed well though the grey wolf compound was very natural. If I compare it to another zoo of similar size, the Sacramento zoo, it lacks a wow factor. The staff are friendly and willing to help. Food and beverages are very expensive, you are better off to bring your own snacks and water.</text>< date>

The Oakland zoo is fairly well maintained. Some of the animal's habitats seen smallish (giraffes, chimpanzee's) . Only one elephant out at the exhibit.The gondola ride to the California trail was the highlight of the entire trail experience. It did have quite a bit for  smaller children to climb on . The Australian train ride was worth the extra money. This zoo is on the lower end of the spectrum for Adult customers. I would rate it higher for children who like rides and diversions.</review>

Great place for kids and family. My 3 yo  loves it. Animal habitats are specious and zookeepers are good people. The lift ticket is a bit expensive IMO. Management should consider reducing the lift ticket price or make it free as their other free gondola ride.</Review>

Very laid back zoo. Great animals that kids like elephants, tigers, giraffes, etc. Place is in hills. So, up down walking which can be tiring if you also have a stroller. Bring your own snacks. There arent many good options.</review>

We love the zoo! The animals seem happy and comfortable and are usually easy to view. It is pretty hilly, and usually pretty busy (so many strollers!). There are nice spots to picnic and also an area with rides you can purchase tickets for. We always have a nice time.<//Review>

We had a wonderful time and learned much. We spent most of our time on the new California Trail accessed via gondola ride. There were 4 young grizzly bears who were very active and so much fun fun to watch. Saw wolves, mountain lions, a black bear and a jaguar! Lots of signage to educate the public. Tons of kids also enjoying new play structures. We were so impressed with the large nature enclosures for the animals! We used our daily admission towards a membership, which you have to do before you leave. We knew we’d be going back.< /Review>

<review>Nice zoo. Most the enclosures are spacious. The animals were active. Lots of docents were available to answer questions. We saw several zoo keepers caring for animals and they were friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to answer questions. We went on an overcast partly rainy day in spring: the train, most the concessions, and the rides were not open due to weather, but we were able to park close in the parking lot and there were no crowds. Highly recommend riding the gondola up to let the kids play on the playground- great nature theame playground for all ages with amazing views and excellent California history on top. Overall, very good day exploring conservation and learning about animals which is why we went!</review>< Pics>

Ageing. But great for a zoo and not so great for safari park. Gondola is free while adults rope way ride up is 3$. Bears and bison make the place worth it. Tropical section great but when it's foggy and cold the primates were huddling together... So much for tropical rainforest.<//Text>

<review>My family came here for a fun day. The exhibits are way better than the San Francisco Zoo and the animals are more active. Parking was a nightmare. I don't know if it was because it was Zoo Lights that evening or not but the website also said it was open until 8 because of this event. It didn't mention that you had to pay to stay at the park past the regular 5pm closing time. So we were told by 1 staff member that the zoo was indeed open until 8 but it was never said that they would lick is out at 5 and then make us re-enter. So we rode the gondola first and only stayed for an hour before being escorted out because the zoo was closing. So instead of seeing animals we spent the whole time waiting in line to be kicked out because the zoo was closing at an earlier time than the wedding and staff portrayed. We were only able to see 5 animals for to their negligence to give the correct closing time information. And the line to the the gondola back down was crazy because they ask how many are in your group and then separate the line based on that and let single people out before the family with small children that were on line before the others just to get more people out of the park earlier. Then complain about the children crying when those children would've already been gone if they never let about 100 other people cut the line. We waited about an extra 20 minutes due to then cutting the line like this. But if we were able to see the rest of the zoo it would've been great if the active animals we did see were any indication of how the rest of the park would've been.<//review>< UserId.>

Best zoo to visit and I have been to many, both in the US and in Europe. Animals have large spaces to enjoy, enrichment to stimulate them to use their natural hunting and scent abilities. There new California section is fabulous; wolves, eagles, brown & grizzly bears and more! There's I lovely play area for young children at this location, plus a cafe.< /review>

I was so surprised at how awesome this zoo is. I didn't expected so my different animals and other species.  It was a beautiful day and A LOT of people. I highly encourage you to visit. The admission is $20+.  There aren't enough water fountains and only a few food stands.  Take your lunch and plenty of water.<//review>

<Text>This is a very nice zoo. Oakland doesn't have a very positive reputation and I really had a lot of reservations about this place before go with my daughter on a field trip. I have to say, I was very impressed. The animals looked great and well cared for. Lots of space for them. The staff was very friendly and educational. I would recommend and I wouldn't have a problem going back. This zoo is better than San Francisco's zoo in my opinion, even though it has fewer animals.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I haven't been to a lot of zoos and wasn't expecting much, except a chance to see some young cousins.  (Humans I was spending time with there, not monkeys.)  I was pleasantly surprised by the zoo, though.  Particularly fascinating watching the social dynamics between the different kinds of primates -- although maybe I just got lucky.  Certainly a lot of animals were just lying around in the hot sun.   Also, it's nice to give kids a visceral sense that this diversity of animals is real.</Text>

<review>This is a Great Zoo. They have a more "open" animal enclosures. There is also benches in the shade in a lot of areas , you can sit and really observe the animals. I love watching family Dynamics of the giraffes !  Food was good in the main restraunt at top of gondola ride .

<review>Took my son here today for his 4th birthday. Hes autistic so we knew it would be a gamble as to if he would respond well or not.  But how the staff reacted was pretty poor.  Line cooks made jokes about the noises my son made when he was over stimulated. Waiting on pizza. "Chef" chris in particular.  Along with another "chef".   as a fellow cook . theres a level of professionalism that needs to be upheld on the line . especially within earshot of customer.  If you have autistic children don't bring them here. The staff is so rude and not compassionate< /review>< Pics>

Good for one day event. Expect crowd on weekends. Try to reach early on weekends so you can get parking. Worth a visit once.< /Text>

My three year old son loves this place like most kids do.  He especially likes riding a train.  And he likes turtles now after seeing the reptiles exhibit.  I was surprised he didn't get tired of walking.  The zoo is so big.</Review>

The only downside is the rides, unfortunately they didn't have enough staff on hand, so we had to wait for one person to leave one ride to operate another ride. I will be coming back very soon fingers crossed we won't have the same problem. Fun times and beautiful animals!!!!!!!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

This place is awesome! I did not expect much since the last time i was here, it was an eye sore. It has been 15+ years. They have done some incredible work. Animals were all so active and the employees, volunteers so helpful. Highly recommended.< /review>

Oakland Zoo is awesome! It's so huge place. You can see a lot of animals🐒🐢🐅🦒.. If you don't want to walk, you can ride gondola or use sky ride. The gondola is free but sky ride is $3. This place close to San Franciscobay area. It takes one hour.  I recommend this place. It was really so fun for me 👍🏻</Review>

It was my 5 yr old 1st trip to the Oakland zoo and he had a blast. Zoo is very well maintained, has very friendly staff and tons of activities for the kids. We we're thrilled with the new gondola ride and absolutely loved the Bay view from upper deck and the animal enclosure. It's a a fun, knowledgeable place to spend a day with friends and family.< /Review>

I love going to the Oakland Zoo, they have lots of animals to see and fun things for the kids to to do. There's a train that takes you around a section of the property, a cable car system that takes you up and over the lions and giraffes to another section of the park with a great view of both Oakland and San Francisco cities from the cable cars.

They also have a new cable car system that takes you on top of the hill to a beautiful restaurant and lovely view of the two cities. The staff all around the zoo are always very friendly and seems to be very knowledgeable about the animals, you'll see them hanging out around some of the main area of the zoo to answer any questions about the animals or to give directions to the to the guests.

Overal, the Oakland Zoo is a wonderful  little treasure in the city of Oakland which attracts visitors from all around the world.

Have fun at the zoo!! I hope this helps.< /Text>

<text>Excellent zoo located in the Oakland hills. Make sure to visit n California Trail up on the hill with display of Grizzly and Black bears, wolves, mountain lions and eagles.

We have been to the Oakland Zoo many times and love the zoo. This visit was to see the new California Trail. The animals and enclosures were perfect. You could really get up close to most of the animals.<//review>

< Review>
I was happy to spend time with family while visiting the Oakland Zoo, however I will voice a concern: The Chimpanzee exhibit was disturbing.. Foliage and Chimpanzees were encased in a glass box-type structure and while onlookers shouted and banged on the outside of the glass one of the larger chimpanzees would repetitively run and throw himself against the inner glass..it was very loud and an incredibly tragic thing to witness..this intelligent species deserves more than, well, to have to be a spectacle in those conditions.</Review>

<Text>Love this zoo. The "cages" do not look like cages but rather they have created spaces to resemble the animal's natural habitat. Good variety and mix. To get to the giraffes and lions be prepared to do a bit of climbing. This zoo is not on a level area but the views from the gondola are nothing less than spectacular.< /Text>< resp>

The zoo was great. There are lots of animals to see and during the week when we went it wasn't very crowded. We we're able to see almost all of the soon in 2 and a half hours, including spending time at the petting zoo and take the gandola to the upper section. If we had more time we would have take the tram to the only section we did not get a chance to see, the 'Wild Australia'.<//text>

The vegetation is lovely around the Zoo although it would be nice to have more trails to take various ways to different exhibits. The animals had well sized and varied enclosures  only problem was vegetation was lush enough to make some hard to find in exhibits.

The Gondola ride was highlight of trip and it will be nice to visit when paths and exhibits are open at the top. The best dining was at the top yet it was always crowded so hopefully they will add more seating, especially outside with the view. That was very limited. It would be a great setting for an evening event at the Zoo and it would be fun to see an adult type event utilizing the spectacular view of the Bay Area and San Francisco.

We were fortunate to have perfect weather. Just enough breeze and temperate weather to make it very comfortable. It might get hot in mid-summer since it's exposed in areas and away from the coast. It's a great place to spend an active day with family.</text>

Such a fun zoo! Even though there were a ton of people during the holiday weekend we were there, it didn't feel crowded at all. The animals had large exhibits and we're surprisingly visible almost all the time. Great play areas for younger kids too. Wish we knew that the cost of rides is not included in the admission, but it didn't really affect the awesome day we had.<//Text>

Lovely little zoo. Easy to walk through and well set up to see the animals from multiple angles.

There are several picnic areas that you can sit with family or a date.

Plenty of paths, so even when it's crowded foot traffic can flow easily.</Text>

<Text>Good place for a family day trip. The main zoo part is fun to traverse because the trail goes up and down and through trees and brush. I felt like I was walking through Jurassic Park. It's nice and big with lots to see and some grassy areas to run around in or have a picnic lunch. There's a new part of the zoo that's only accessed by a gondola ride up the foothills. Once you're up there it's this huge deck that goes around the perimeter and you look down into the enclosures to see the wolves or whatnot. There's an area for the kids to play and climb on stuff.

The cons of visiting here though is that first off it's not nearly as aesthetic as the SF zoo. They've left it pretty overgrown and natural which isn't a bad thing per ces but it does feel a little out of control. Also, there were a lot of exhibits that were closed and empty. If they can't put an animal there then they should clear it for picnic benches or playgrounds. The bathrooms were a wreck! Dirty and a lot of non functional sinks/dispensers/etc. And lastly, there was literally 2 benches to sit down on to rest or just watch an animal up in the newer area and the whole area is pretty much in the sun. So as cool as the new area is, it was pretty miserable to visit when you couldn't sit down and rest for 5 minutes or get out of the sun<//Text>< gmap_id>

Great Zoo. Awesome time with the family. Gondola ride is a must see. You have to time the exhibit right before the animals go take a nap.</Text>

It's okay... We were able to visit all exhibitions for 3 hours, but most animals are hidden and you can't really see them. I guess about 50% are not visible. Couldn't see wolfs, monkeys, 🐻. We were able to capture some shots of condors and bald eagle. There is a good playground at the top though, kids had fun riding on grass. I personally think most disappointing is that windows are dirty with some liquid drop and you can't see sometimes animals because of that and hard to take a good picture.</Review>

Not so big, but big enough to spend a day (10am to 4pm).. Love the Tigers, Lions and Elephants there, Other interesting animals there are Giraffe, Camel, Alligators, Tortoise, Chimpanzee, Zebra, Small python, Kangaroo(by train), birds and more.. Free gondola rides, the small one goes over Tigers and Lions, by Camel, Giraffe and Elephants, the big one takes you to a restaurant and another area that is opening in summer 2018.. The kids rides are not free with the entrance tickets, costs ~$2 to $4 per ride. Train ride is $3.5 per person . OR I think you can pay extra $24 for all the rides. Parking extra $10.</Text>

Huge attractive layout.  Disappointed not all of the animals were available.  Cafe was affordable.  The holiday lights were cute although I think it shouldve been with regular admission instead of an additional $10.</Text>

< Review>
Great zoo, new gondola is amazing!  There are a lot of hills, so it's moderately strenuous to spend the day there.  Apart from the zoo (separate, but adjoining) is a small amusement park for younger kids.  The little train is very cool, as it enters the zoo and gives an up close view of some of the Australian animals as well as beautiful views of the whole Bay Area (on a clear day).  Views from the new gondola station are great too, but it gets windy up there, so bring a jacket!  Hope this helps you plan your visit.<//Review>

This is THE best zoo in the Bay Area. Huge complex with lots of room for animals to roam - it shows in how the animals just seem more active than at the SF zoo. If you’ve got small kids they’ll be delighted by the adjacent mini-carnivalesque park with a smattering of kid rides, train and mini roller coaster. Great place to spend time as a family, would probably be a fantastic location for a kid’s birthday party.< /Review>

<time>1577558843333< /time><rate>5<//rate><Text>This is a terrific zoo! While it is not the San Diego zoo, it is far superior to the San Francisco Zoo. It has very natural large enclosures for the animals and seems to incorporate various aspects of the land. The addition of the gondola and the California wildlife exhibit at the top of the hill is amazing. I love how it seems as though the enclosures are really nothing more than an untouched  patch of native land including namesake Oak trees. My favorite animal is the jaguar, which my 18 month old daughter referred to as a kittykat when it was locked eyes with her six inches from the glass. I jokingly informed her that kittykat was looking at her like a snack. The highlight of the medium sized play area is the zipline. There is always a line of parents and kids waiting for there chance to send their kids flying down into a quintet of springs that stop the flyer less violently than other ziplines I have seen and ridden. Great selection of animals with Africa making the most prolific appearance. Overall it is an awesome zoo and I highly recommend it.<//Text>< Pics>

We visited the Zoo a couple of week ago with our two grand children age 3.5 and 1.5. What a change from 30 years ago when we went with our own children! A lot of money has been invested and the zoo is still being expanded with new areas. It is a very pleasant, safe, and well run place. A great experience for our grand children.</Text>

Awesome zoo with a great variety of animals. Nice enclosures and well laid out, with things to interest children and grown ups.  Plenty of amenities and also a train ride and gondola, which were both fun and let you see parts of the zoo which would not have been accessible otherwise. Refreshments were available, decent quality and reasonably priced, staff were friendly and helpful.</review>

What an amazing and underrated and understated Zoo! And quite honestly we're talking a 2 to 3 hour difference in commute round trip to go here versus to go to the San Francisco Zoo from Sacramento</Text>

A lot of the animals weren't there, I feel like I spent a lot of time looking at empty habitats. I wish I hadn't gone... total waste of money. I don't recommend coming here and unfortunately wouldn't come back. Little bottles of water were overpriced too.</text>

Went to check out the gondola and they were pretty cool. Nice, mostly clean, little zoo. Some of the enclosures were depressing and others were quite impressive.
The area at the top of the gondolas was great. The "restaurant" at the top is not really what I'd expected. We ended up not eating there because lines were long and the place really didn't seem to offer anything special.

Overall, pretty enjoyable outing.< /review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>New gondola to new exhibits now.  The Zoo is overall a great day out, and is certainly the better choice in the bay area for zoos.  I do have "some" gripes though.  First, the new area has a LARGE area dedicated to wolves.  I saw zero wolves.  Plenty of dead dish as feeding bait, but zero wolves.  Bunt animals are unpredictable so I will give it a pass THIS time.

The REAL gripe is with the staff here.  Overwhelmingly, most of the staff can't be bothered or are clearly disinterested in their job.  The number of faces displaying "I hate my job" is extremely noticeable and distracting from what could be a great experience.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Awesome experience, however Limited parking so try and reach as early as possible. Has gondola lifts and cable carts to commute within zoo. A lot of animals but be prepared to walk.< /review>

Mismanaged and disorganized, but the kids don't care! Also, member tips included!

I'll start by saying we are members of the OZ, and have been for years. We believe in the mission and the kids love it - zoo lights, the gondola, the new California experience, the rides, and every single animal habitat... truly, they LOVE IT.

Here's the but, and this hopefully is constructive... It is poorly managed. You can tell this is a culture thing. It comes from the top down. Keep in mind that the members and visitors really only see and interact with the service staff. Not the zoo keepers, not the management, but the people running the show. It is abundantly clear that they are just there to push a button or advance a line or sling a chicken tender. They are not there to be helpful or usually even polite. In fact, most of them are on their phones and, if they even look at you, it looks as if their very souls are being crushed if you deign to ask where the restroom is. Crushed.

The volunteers, on the other hand, are usually the opposite and go out of their way to provide info, chat up your kids, or just make sure you're enjoying yourself. Strangely, not paid.

Anyway, as promised, here is the local/member tips part: if you don't have kids in tow, do whatever you like, unencumbered and free to enjoy without a million bathroom and snack breaks! If, like most of us, you have at least one young child in tow, lucky you! Seeing this world through the eyes of a child is pure magic, so:
1. Arrive by 10am. Forget nap. Park in the upper lot nearest the main entrance. If you arrive past 10am on a weekend there's a good chance you're parking in the lower lot of having to walk some insane distance up a crazy hill.
2. Bring a stroller with storage space or a wagon, snacks, plenty of water/juice boxes (for bribery), and a full meal. Also a blanket.
3. It's usually good weather in the hills, so bring layers, but plan to be warmer than colder. Sunglasses, hats, and sunscreen help a lot.
4. They recently changed the parking paradigm so now you have to collect a ticket and pay for parking at admission, which is truly the DUMBEST THING EVER. Until they change it back, park in the upper lot and as close to the rides as possible. This is important.
5. Dress said children in sturdy, comfy shoes that will not fall off their feet. See gondolas, roller coaster, running, frog pond, and any other number of fun things where shoes go missing.
6. Do not, under any circumstances, go to Tuskers, the restaurant. Not only is it crazy overpriced, it also takes exactly one elephant's life span to get your food. Unfortunately, they have excellent french fries, so you will be tempted. See #2.
7. Best exhibits: the California Experience (new high speed gondola up to the highest point of the zoo), the lions (best view of those guys from the original gondola ride near the train tracks), the lower Children's playground and frog pond/alligator exhibit, and the amphibian and reptile house. We also love the bat house but that's not for everyone!
8. Best rides: the train, of course, but the line is long so be prepared to wait and have some fun riddle or something for the kiddos to do whilst waiting, otherwise you're just in for a lot of swinging from the corral railings. The carousel is well done and the tiger roller coaster is scary-fun, in a mostly good way. The littlest ones will like the car "driving" ride and the carousel, the Jeep ride and perhaps the airplanes. Tickets for rides are the best deal at $24 for 16 booklet. Otherwise they're $1.75 each.
9. End your day at the rides, bribe everyone with a cotton candy or ice cream to get them to leave, and then voila! You're right near your car and the exit!
10. Become a member. We kvetch, but the money is immediately made up in just one family outing, and it goes to a really good cause!

If they would just revamp the management, put a little more pep in everyone's step, and sweep and paint the place so it doesn't look so shabby and run down, then we'd be in business. Dare I say we might even get 4 or more stars.< /review>

Visited with my then 6 year old son mid-week, on a day threatening rain so we had the place pretty much to ourselves.

Sat on a bench for a while watching a chimpanzee idle his way through a Seventeen magazine, glancing up every page or two to see what his (her) mates were up to.

Hard to convey how electrifying it was to experience the presence of this animal that seemed just a few notches away from humanity.  Stayed with me for days.<//review>

4 years after our last visit, the Oakland zoo has improved quite a bit with a new area that you access by gondolas. Amazing views, fun ride for the kids, we'll make the trip to Oakland more regularly now as we became members of the Oakland zoo</text>

<text>Oakland zoo is a fantastic place for families with kids or folks who just love animals. It's got a decent variety of animals and wonderful activities for the little ones as well. A great Cafe and the ability to bring your own food make it a pretty amazing way to spend a morning or afternoon with the family. But try to get there early since that's when some of the animals are best seen.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It's definitely worth checking out. For a smaller zoo, it's done up decent. I recommend it. Beware that it's a pocket drain. They charge 10 dollars just to park, let alone the entrance fee.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Maybe not a good idea to come during Christmas holiday time. So crowded. Had to park far away from the gate. And the restroom - had to wait for long because space is very tight. I’d say it’s not worthwhile to drive from South Bay if you’re taking a baby younger than 2. The drive was challenging for us and the 10-4 timing is just hard to accommodate our baby’s schedule(our baby no longer can fall asleep in stroller). Inside it’s long walks from site to site and somehow just didn’t feel so interesting. Not to blame the zoo, but I regretted my decision, especially considering the $24/each +10 parking. I’d recommend a smaller park like happy hallow, for families with young babies. For big fancy zoo, I’d say the one down in San Diego.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great zoo. Some animals are allowed more privacy than others, you will need binoculars to spot the lions when they are not napping behind trees/ bushes. Expect to miss a certain number of animals just because. The new gondolas are nice and smooth. The view from the new restaurant is worth the trip, not the food. Absolutely unacceptable menu with a very limited options. With such amazing views one would expect  an equally attractive menu, no so fast. More healthy options are needed.</text>

This is our first visit since they opened the new area on top of the hill.  Much larger area for the animals.  Only saw the bears though.  Play area for kids and the landing for the gondola has a restaurant in it.  Great views from there.  We went on a day when the gondola was getting its monthly maintenance, so there was a shuttle.  They shuttle slows things down a lot.  Narrow road and one vehicle either upper or down.</Text><Rate>4< /Rate><response>{'time': 1538497182716, 'text': 'Thanks for the review!

The zoo is really clean but there's a lot of uneven pavement and up and down Hills that are hard to maneuver when you have a wheelchair. The Christmas lights program is nice except it's too dark on the walkways to see where you're going<//Text>

<rate>4</rate><text>This is one of the few zoo's I actually like going to. It's clean, well laid out with a good variety of exotic animals in enclosures I consider reasonably humane. There's lots of goodies to entertain little ones. It's a good size too, you can cover it in about 3 hours at a leisurely place. The only thing I don't like about it is the crowd. Wow! it is popular on the weekends. If you get the chance to go on a weekday, you'll enjoy it much more.</text>< Pictures>

Fun urban zoo nestled in the Oakland hills. Great for kids, parents and grandparents. When you tire of the animals, the views of the Bay will take up the slack.</Review>

It's a good place to spend time with your family. It has a lot of animals but not as many as other zoos I have visited. Something that I really like about this zoo is that it is very clean. It is one of the cleanest zoos I have visited.< /Text>

<Review>By far the best zoo in northern California. Rides for the kids. All types of animals and they all look happy and healthy. They are adding more in July of 2018 and my family and I are excited to go see the new animals. The layout of the park is very user friendly and wide enough to get around those slower people!

This zoo turned out to be a real hidden gem. We were amazed at the extensive new expansion, and the amount of land the animals have to roam there. We got a membership, and will be returning very soon. One day is not enough to see everything!< /review>

Good place to go with family. The zoo is not too big. So kids won't tire out. Kids would love the gondola ride that comes free with the admission ticket. The Australian outback train ride is also a highlight.< /Text>

<review>My family and I went to Oakland zoo today and while we obviously loved the animals and are always thrilled to be able to have experiences like this with our kids, there are definitely a few areas that could be improved. My number ONE complaint here is the staff. They are rude and miserable. The people who help park vehicles were in such a bad mood. One guy was literally yelling at us and others to "JUST PARK THERE" on the side of the road...it was obvious he was pissed and annoyed...not okay!!!! Next, the people who help with snacks. Couldn't get a smile out of any of them and they all looked like they hated their lives. Oh and their attitudes we're peachy. Other complaint would have to be the feeding times were not accurate and when I asked an employee about it they didn't know when the feedings would take place. I went to 3 feeding times listed on the pamphlet and none were taking place at that time. Over all, a nice zoo but we had a better experience at SF zoo for cheaper.< /review>< Date>

As Zoos go, this is one of the nicer zoos. Habitats seem friendlier to the occupants. It is set up as, somewhat, meandering trails. Thus, you are not just walking from one enclosure to another. I enjoy Zoo Lights during the Winter Holidays.< /Review>

I went to the Oakland zoo last Friday with my daughter’s class for a field trip. The trip was well planned out. At the zoo they have classrooms for all of the guided tours. Our teacher/tour guide was supper friendly and had lots of information to give out.

This is my first time going to the zoo and I was surprised to see how nice the zoo was.  It is a large zoo and the animals looked happy for the most part. The best part of the zoo was seeing all of the animals out and about. We saw the lions, elephants, giraffes and flamingos just to name a few. (Going early is probably the best time).

After the tour the kids were able to go back to the classroom and have lunch. They also have a nice courtyard for the kids to eat at. The day we went it had just rained, so we were not able to enjoy the outside area.
Next to classroom was a whole area set up for the kids to run and play. I loved how you could explore and find new areas of the zoo. The kids had a great time seeing the bug exhibit and crocodiles. I also liked that the exhibits were scattered throughout the park and exploring with the kids was so much fun.

My group had time to pet the animals which was a nice touch. I wish I had more time to explore the zoo, but the bus was ready to pick us up and go back to school.< /text>

Beautiful animals, staff is great while we were there chimpanzee was having a fit, throwing toys against window, and jumping against window. Staff stepped in had people move away from windows until he calmed down. They were friendly and answered questions they did a great job in making sure animals were properly taken care of.

I would highly recommend the Oakland Zoo.  We have been members for several years now.   The membership pays for itself with a few visits.

They have a nice selection of animals from around the world,  several kids play areas, and several restaurants.

The new gondola is worth riding, just for the view, and they did an excellent job on the new California exhibit up top.<//text>

I haven't visited in a few years and so much has changed. The new area they are building higher up in the hills will be opening sometime soon and looks like it's going to be amazing. The area will have animals that are indigenous to California. It's great to see the money going to great improvements and additions to the zoo. As a child we'd visit every Easter and enjoyed all the animals. I now bring my children and they love it just as much as I did. My favorite are the Lions and tigers. Such beautiful and majestic creatures.<//review>

Great place. Way better than Monterey Aquarium as far as price and exhibits is concerned. Also, I'm from L.A. and we have a famous zoo, but it is terrible compared to this one. Also, they have tons of teen volunteers helping out, which is great for us and them. Only negative is kids over 2 have a pretty high entrance fee, but I'll let it slide b/c of how great it is. It closes at 5, but we stayed 'till 530 and no one hassled us. Goat petting zoo is the best!!! We had to rush to experience everything. Also, bears are co-best (8<//text>

< Review>
Wonderful zoo in the rather challenged city of Oakland.  Animals appear well cared-for, and the happy families of all races and ethnicities are a lesson for xenophobes.  Beautiful new gondola lift to a counter restaurant on the hilltop, where the food is better than in most such places.  Love it.<//Review>

I know I can count on Oakland Zoo to keep my kids smiling. The animals always look happy. It's more like an animal sanctuary. I'm a vegetarian and I support Oakland Zoo. I know many vegans that do as well.
They've added a new deli center at the top of the rise ride. It's a great cafe with healthy foods. There's a restroom up there as well.
Upon entrance to the zoo there's a gift shop, bring a few extra dollars, support the animals and staff.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Good collection of animals but poor  execution as a zoo. Inadequate signage compounded by no prior warning that key exhibits (elephants and lions) not on show due to works.  Add that several refreshment outlets closed.  And charging $20 entry for a 2 year old and this grandad says next time we're going elsewhere.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>We love the Oakland zoo! We signed up for emails and we get cool offers. On Valentine's day they sent us an email to drop off the kids at the zoo while we go enjoy the evening! How cool is that! They always send promotional helpful emails that are good reading. The zoo is clean. The staff is friendly. The animals are awesome and the kids rides are a wonderful addition to the zoo.</Review>< Pictures>

Pretty decent as zoos go.  Not too big,  on a hilly slope that is a bit of a workout pushing strollers on a hot day!.  The new gondola looks cool, takes you to top of the zoo, but the line was too long for us that day.  Giraffe, and primate exhibits I liked best.  Petting zoo also,  looked overrun with kids, animals mostly goats.  Cafes at the top.  Train ride is teriffic and there is a small midway for kids.  $24 adults free under 2yrs and I think around $18? for 7yr old.</Text>

Great place to take your children to learn about wild animals. As sad as it is to see these animals in captivity, you can't take your children to Safari over the weekend. Lots of family friendly activities (we planted poppy seeds in a cup last time we went.)</Review>

I love this zoo! I think they did a wonderful job in creating this zoo. It is clean and well-organized. As someone who worries about the animals and zoochosis, I think the animals here seem well taken care of and have generally large enclosures. I really enjoyed the new gondola ride to the top of the zoo! I had a great time with my family here.< /Text>

The California trail area is amazing - really well done, with a conservation mindset and animal care ethos I really approve of. There's also a small little rides area and a train that drives through an Emu and Wallaby enclosure. That said, some of the older exhibits have small enclosures, with animals I don't necessarily think should be in a zoo in California.< /review>

Great place to take kids. We went on usual weekend end of September but the place was super crowded. The exit and the parking itself took more than 20 mins and we just ended up parking on grass instead of the parking lots! Other than that...this place has a variety of animals..giraffe, camel, elephant, tiger lion, monkeys...etc. Very interesting for kids.  I kinds wish they had a park with some swings and food options.</text>

<user_name>Larry Platt</user_name><text>A good too. Small enough you can do it in a day's visit but still varied enough to find animals you will enjoy.  I like the baboons, the river otters, and the meerkats. But there are reptiles, bugs, tigers and elephants. Very nice enclosures for the animals, albeit enclosures. There is a gondola ride to a good Cafe that is a bit pricey but I liked the chicken sandwich. Things for kids to climb on when they need something more active than viewing<//text>< UserId.>

<text>Had a great time here.  Animal enclosures are small but they have a good variety.  My favorite part of my visit was the new gondola. It is absolutely amazing.  If there is one thing you do here then ride the gondola! Kiddie play area is also great to let the kids run around.  They have picnic tables next to this area which is great for families< /text>< Pictures>

This zoo was great. A nice variety of animals and very family friendly. Went first thing when they opened and it was crowded. One of the lifts(That carries you over the animals) was not working, but overall a great way to spend a day.<//text>

great place to have fun and enjoy a nice long walk seeing all the wonderful wildlife. My only complain is the prices on food. According to the attendant the prices are because it helps cover feed costs for the Animals? other than that it's nice to visit. My fave was watching the Giant tortoise eat up some tasty veggies...yum!</review>

My recommendation is to park in the lower lot as you will then be walking down hill at the end of your visit. The African animal section is great. The new sky Cafe and lift are fun.

A great day and a great way to escape the heat in San Joaquin County.  The temps were in the 70s and the zoo was perfect in both sun and shade.  It was a great 2-3 hour walk among the African and aisian animals.</Text>

We still had to pay full price and when asked I was told that they would not be giving a discount for the train ride since the gondola was down. I verified that we have to pay the same price as others who are able to ride the gondola and was told “yep.”  Very frustrated for our kids.< /text>< pics>

<review>Preferred over SF zoo. Beautiful views of SF from the zoo. Easy parking when you arrive when the zoo opens. All the major animals. Hilly for pushing strollers, so don't attempt this if you're not in decent walking condition. I do wish that the rides (train, carousel etc) didn't cost a bunch of extra money, but it's nice to have those things there either way.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I think this zoo is just the right size; it's not exhaustingly enormous, but it's not too small either, so my friend and I were able to see almost all the exhibits within 2.5 hrs. The staff members were very friendly and helpful, so we were able to ask questions and learn a lot about the animals we saw. If anything, I highly recommend taking the gondola up to the northmost exhibit. There's a playground for kids, lots of endemic species of animals to see up close, and an outlook point with an excellent view of the bay and San Fransisco! The parking lot fills up pretty quickly, so I suggest arriving at open.< /Review>

Decent zoo if you live in the Bay area, I would not consider it worth if you are only visiting the area. I kind of like the diversity but not the layout nor the side cost of some attraction.</Text>

This is one of the best zoos I've visited. Most of the animals can always be seen. Accept those darn lions. But if you take the Sky Ride you can see them from there. The train is also cool for seeing animals you can't see from anywhere else. The food is pretty good and the staff are super friendly.<//Text>

It takes you up to the upper level of the zoo and the view from the Gondola lift,and the viewing platform at the top, of the bay, San Francisco city and the surrounds are just outstanding.You have just got to go.< /review><response>{'time': 1552664960645, 'text': 'Thanks for the review Joy!'}<//response><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

Had a wonderful time?
A place for adults and kids! Lots open space for the animals! Haven't seen bisons in any other zoo. Gondola ride is fun, and offers a scenic view of SF Bay. Reasonably priced!</Text>

<Review>Exhibit it huge! Saw most of the animals, gondola was closed due to high winds so didn't see the animal high on the hillside. Not much in the way of food, only one cafe and it was packed. Otherwise a great trip<//Review>< user_id>

Nice children's zoo. My daughter brushed friendly goats. Some steep hills to walk. The 2018 expansion is very nice - can't wait for it to fully open.</text>

The Gondola is a great addition to this place.  From the top is a nice view of the bay area (this was the highlight of our visit).

I recently moved here so I was unaware that the area with all the California animals was new but it's great! Zoo has large areas for animals so they are not stuck in small cages. Take the ride on the new gondola to the top. It's worth it!!!</Review>

Lots of imaginative spaces for kids to play and high end food and drinks a short, free gondola ride away at the new Landings cafe in the California adventure area. And lots of great rescue animals including lions, tigers, elephants, giraffes, and many species of adorable monkeys to name a few.<//review>< GmapID>

Excellent zoo and educational experience for the whole family. The zoo is well designed (for actual walking and not vehicles like other zoos) and the exhibits are very well thought out. Went with a 3 and 5 year old and we had to leave when the zoo closed. Staff was very friendly and professional even when crowded. Recommend bringing your own food since the cafes get really crowded during meal times. Both cable cars are a must in my opinion, the other stuff (train, carousel, etc) is more of a money trap :)

Plenty to do, will definitely go back. Highly recommended!<//review>

I've lived in the Bay Area since 1990. I just visited the Oakland Zoo for the first time this year. My friends and I arrived before the gates opened and joined a line. It's a little, ok a lot, crazy at the gates before they open. Lots of confusion, coupled with excitement. Screaming kids, yelling parents, the usual. Once the gates open, it's a free for all. Everyone is pushing and running. I'm convinced the adults misbehave more than adults.
Once inside, we made our way to the new gondolas. We were literally the first ones there and ended up waiting a few more minutes for the attraction to open. No worries.
The gondolas were comfortable and clean. The boarding and exiting process were seamless. (even for a wheelchair in my party)
The views from the gondolas are phenomenal. The higher you go, the more of the Bay Area you see. The gentle breeze was a welcomed bonus.
The food court was a pleasant surprise. Personally, I don't think the prices were too high. The food was actually delicious. Each of us got something different and none of us were disappointed.
We enjoyed all of the animals and exhibits. I'm glad we went early. The park gets really crowded. It really warms up too. I thought I was going to pass out while visiting the camels. Can't wait to go back now that the new exhibits are open.<//Text>

<review>Decent admissions price. We definitely did spend about 3 1/2 hours here. The exhibits are nice and the Cafe is a must see especially with the view over top of Oakland. They even have a petting yard to pet goats and sheep. Wish we would came here next year for the new jaguar and wolves exhibit.</review>< user_name>

This is a great zoo for small children. Must sees are the Howler Monkey right in the middle of the park, the new California Trail exhibit, and the train that goes around the park and right through and Emu and Wallaby enclosure. We're members and you can definitely spend a great, whole day here.< /text>

<review>The Zoo is great! Wide enclosures for the animals. Good mix of shade and sun. We love the new gondola to take you up and have a great view over the bay.
I perso ally think that food and drinks are way overpriced. Almost 4$ for a small milk is a lot!</review>< Pictures>

<text>exhibits and variety of animals was great but some of the exhibits you have to pay to take a train ride to see, which after paying to get in and the insane prices of food, drinks, and rides it was just not worth it. that was mildly disappointing.

Oakland zoo is good, my daughter enjoyed the day at zoo. There is lots of parking space , if you are late then you will need to park the vehicle uphill and walk back quite a distance. $7 for stroller rental, in case if you have not carried the stroller. Some of the rides like train ride , and few others are paid ones. Gondola ride is included in the ticket. Cotton candy , popcorn is $4 a pack. Restrooms are clean and neatly maintained. You need 4-5 hours to cover the entire zoo.<//Text>

I really enjoy talking my young children to this zoo. They haveba good range of big animals and some interesting less common exhibits, like bats. They also have a petting zoo for children.

The exhibits are not far from each other so it is easy to get through the park in one day. New gondola is open, great view from the top.</text>

<Text>Awesome!!!! One of the BEST zoos I've ever been too! The first, in fact. I used to live in Oakland and conveniently close to the zoo. Even now in Danville, a town Contra Costa County, but along the border of Alameda County, I still live close, for it is on the other side of San Ramon. I've always loved that zoo ever since I was little and I still love it now. Eleven years ago, I also attended a zoo camp program and LOVED IT!!!!

I strongly recommended this zoo to everyone - especially those that live in the East Bay. I also recommend this zoo to scientists, like myself, those that want the access to animals they don't usually get to encounter, those that love nature and being outdoors, and all Lion King fans, such as me!!

Every time I've been to the Oakland Zoo, the place has also reminded me of the animal/nature films I grew up with such as Dumbo, The Jungle Book, and of course, The Lion King. I've been there many times with friends and I'm strongly hoping to get a job there someday.

I've had so much experience with the Oakland Zoo and have loved it! Everyone there is treated like friends and family. It is a perfect place for others to spend time at and socialize, and also to hold events.

If you need time to spend with lions, tigers, elephants, bears or other animals you don't get to be with everyday, come to the Oakland Zoo and see how awesome that zoo really is!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

More features fun for even younger children.  The new Gondola ride takes you even higher than before.  The view of the bay is spectacular from the top.  There is even a cafe up there.  As it decends back down to the main part of the zoo you get sight of parts of the zoo you can't see on foot.  One of our all time favorite parts of the zoo is the train ride.<//Review>< Time>

<text>We were there for about 4 hours all of the staff members were very nice and all around the park sharing great knowledge and information about the zoo animals. A few exhibits were closed, I wished there were more elephants. At the time we were there only one came out. Food was pricey at the Landing Cafe and the gentlemen serving was not wearing gloves and was on his phone (not sanitary)<//text><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

<text>The gondola was fantastic, free and never seemed to be more than a couple minutes wait in line. Restaurant at the top had great food but be prepared for those park prices and the line moved pretty slow. I think they are still working on how to keep the lines moving. $12 sandwiches, burgers and pizzas. Bring your own beverages to the park. 9 bucks for a soda. Animals were all visible and park was very clean. Restrooms were very accessible and clean. Parking looks a little heavy when you show up but don't be discouraged, there is lots of room in the park.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Sweet zoo. It was our first time to this zoo and we loved it. Lots of hills to climb, you have to pay $10 for parking, and food is expensive (small coffee was $4.50!), But the animals are neat to look at and they have pretty big enclosures. Worth it if you have kids!</Review>

Okay zoo as far as animals but the hills you have to walk and all the back and forth is crazy. There is no going around it is a bunch of dead ends and going back the way you came. Food prices are outrageous so bring your own. Example: small bottle of water is $4.57< /text>

Impressive conservation and education efforts. I have never been to a zoo where the animals have had this much space and freedom, and it was cool to see, even though there aren't a ton of animals there. We also went to Zoo Lights this Christmas season, and the display was very cool. The train ride was lots of fun at night with all the lifts up!<//Text>

A great place to take your family.  The zoo is always well kept and is constantly expanding or upgrading.  Wild turkeys and peacocks in the area.  It is in the Oakland Hills, so be prepared for some steep climbs if you have a stroller or wheelchair.<//review>

One of the best zoo experiences! The animals are happy and healthy, the habitats are clearly comfortable for them but you can still get close and enjoy them. The California wildlife section is a part you cannot miss!< /Review>

<review>Born an raised in Oakland, always had a good time. We got the membership for our family, why take the kids to the park when you can go to the zoo any day! The animals look healthy, it's well kept, and plenty to see. They are expanding the zoo to add a few more animals which is great. The lift to the cafe up top is free, also has a great view of Oakland. I've been taking my daughter here since she was born and she pretty much memorized the entire park. Shes never bored of it. Theres always something new to learn or talk about. Fun for the entire family. If you dont enjoy walking especially uphill, then that's a shame. It's great exercise for the kids and for yourself. The amusement park on the side of the zoo is fun for the kids too, the only ride I didn't like is the tiger roller coaster. I took my daughter on it recently for the first time. Seemed pretty dangerous because it didn't really secure her in place. If I wasn't in the ride with her, holding her head, she definitely would have hurt herself. Possibly banging her head into the ride. Other than that the other rides are safe and in great order.< /review><Name>adam pham<//Name><Rating>5</Rating><time>1531120880623< /time><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9Fmgzc522-9vSH_Odj47NwMGxehB1dMP104Gx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< GmapID>

A great days out visit location. The animals are very well cared for with lots of open space to roam. Not the typical cages pens. You need a good 4-5 hours here to enjoy all the sights, and get educated on all the animals there.</Text>

Zoo was nice. My rating is for the cafeteria. DO NOT EAT HERE. Save your money. Staff is rude and ignores you once you place your order. No changes, no questions answered, they just avoid eye contact. Overall terrible experience, food is less than average and as expensive as expected. Really ruined the whole experience.< /Review>

<review>I have to say that I was very impressed with the Oakland Zoo. They have an aerial tram and family pass deals also, it’s a nice little surprise to find a nice zoo with numerous animals and a nice park so close to San Francisco but not San Francisco. Keep up the good work Oakland!< /review>< Pictures>

Great place to visit with kids - didactic, kid friendly.

Cafeteria crowded, expensive, food so-so. Bringing a picnic recommended.

I found this piece of advice a jewel...<//text>

<text>Awesome zoo for younger kids: 3-10 or so. Nice small petting area, and a small but fun selection of amusements/rides. Rides are slightly pricey for what you get, but still good clean weekend fun. Check out an animal feeding while there. Families of 4 or more should consider a membership - pays for itself in a visit and a half, and that way you can run in and out for a few hours and still get your monies worth.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

Great place to take the kids for an outing. There's lots of different exhibits and they are currently adding another large section. Not impressed by the food selection, but I usually bring my own anyway. You could spend the entire day here. Definitely recommend the membership so you don't feel like you have to see everything when you go, but can always come back.</Review>

The new California exhibit gives great up-close views of grizzly bears, black bears, jaguar, mountain lions, bison, and Condors  with a fun play area for kids all with a beautiful Vista of the bay and Oakland. The queuing for the gondola to get to the California exhibit, however, is a bit chaotic. The rest of the zoo was fine but some exhibits like the bug house seem a little tired.< /Text>

Great family place -- kids love the animals, all seems clean and well-treated, and the mini-amusement park next door is always a hit. Staff is great too -- Jeff Patterson, an EMT and fix-it guy there, helped jump-start our car one day and gave our daughter some extra hand stamps she was begging for the other day. Everyone cares!</Review>

Not enough animals. Not a wide verity. Some were not available to be seen. Some sections were closed off. Rides were under construction. I love animals and I would like to see a wider variety.
There is no food options except one small place for some quick and expensive garbage.
Visit and decide if you like it. I loved the animals I did see, however, I will not revisit the same venue.</Text>

For a few hours of volunteering, we got free admission to the zoo for the rest of the day and an extremely discounted lunch! The zoo itself is nice, too.

<Text>I have loved this Zoo for years. I enjoy the small compact size and all the staff and docents that work with the animals always are so nice, informative, and seem to love all the aninals.

Only 4 stars cuz exhibits on the hill are difficult to see animals. We saw no wolves, mt lions, or black bears. However, they are built for the animals comfort so I understand.
Also only 4 stars cuz too many strollers blocking viewing or preschoolers running or pushing to the front while parent or nanny just watches their rude behavior and does nothing about it. Not the zoo's fault but still left me with only a 4 star experience.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

My family and I had a blast at the zoo, many different animals to see and it had been updated since my daughter was little (now she is 10). Very fun experience, and the gondola was free to ride to see the other part of the park where we ate at the cafe. I was impressed by the quality and quantity of food; most items were only $10-$12. They had pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and even salad choices. There was also cheaper foods in the main part of the zoo which offered slushies which thw kiddos loved. Overall, it was amazing!< /Text>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>The zoo had a lot of shady paths and good viewing.  Some of the paths had some incline but nothing really strenuous.  The exhibits were very nice and gave the visitors many choices for viewing.  The rides for the kids were a big hit.  The only drawback was the price of food.  A hamburger was $11.00 and  fountain drinks were. $6.00 to $8.00.</Review>< Pictures>

It's only held in December, there is a gondola ride you must take, you can see the whole Bay area and it is a fantastic sight plus there is an eatery and bathrooms for your convenience at the top of the mountain,  A must see and a great adventure for all.

Very nice zoo, the sky ride and gondola ride is a must do. Nice animals in good conditions. Just that it is hilly so be prepared to walk/climb hills.</Review>

OAKLAND ZOO IS AWESOME.  So much better than  SF Zoo 150% .  Giraffes, Elephants, Camels, Lions, tigers, pigs, reptiles, bats, petting zoo with goats and sheep, cool animals everywhere and a SUPER COOL airway skybus with views of San Francisco and the sunset that takes you up to a trail with more animals!</Review>

Where are the wolfs?!? The zoo is very close to the highway :( The rest is fantastic. It would be very interesting if we knew the stories of the animals</Review>

Nice zoo and could see big animals (elephants, lion) which are not there in San Fransisco zoo. The gondola ride is free with the entry ticket of zoo and unlimited times. It takes not more than 3 hours to visit the entire zoo at a low pace. So can round up the entire zoo twice in a day if interested to spend time.< /Review>

I've been coming here as long as I can remember, and it's been growing bigger as the years have gone by. This place is perfect for family outings and super kid friendly.  They have all kinds of animals, from lemurs to elephants, and more.  I really liked the fact tat they allow you to leave the zoo for whatever reason and comeback, all you have to finish show them your parking receipt and get a stamp on your hand.</Review>

It's really nice the price is right for the zoo with all of the upgrade. Well worth, I spent 3 hours there and could've spent more time. My 4 year old lived it.</Review>

Had a great time for our 2 year anniversary! The animals were active and visible. It wasn't overly busy due to rain and it being a Monday afternoon. The ticket price is a little high, but worth it.<//Text>

< Review>
It was a beautiful day for the zoo. When I arrived with my family to spend the day with the kids we entered the park around 11 am. We got directed to the farthest part of the park. We didn't get any options of where to park which might be harder for families who have strollers or have family memebers who are disabled. Walking on grass isn't easy for you to push your stroller. Once coming on from the bottom entrance we loved every spot from the insects to tortoises. The kids love exploring the park and seeing these animals through very safe displays. We didn't have the chance ro ride the train but it looked really fun if we have another chance down the road.the newest part of the park, which you have to take the newest gondola, was great! The gondola goes up high and smoothly as long as you stay seated and don't move a lot. Each gondola can hold up to 6 adults which is great for families who have kids and many adults. Once to the top the bison were nice. The main attraction were the grizzly bears which you could see them from all angles and they could have privacy, have a swim to cool off and enjoy a simple swim. The cages up here were well thought out and they seem tranquil.when we got back down we went through the safari section of the park. When we got to the lion exhibit we could not see them but we definitely could hear them. When we got to elephant part one of the elephants seems depressed but I don't know why. I hope the people at the zoo see this and help it. At the very end we walked the whole park and left 40 minutes after closing time but we lived the park. If you go on a beautiful sunny day you can see the north part of the bay easily as we did. Would I go back? Yep it was definitely a great experience and recommend this to all families! !! 😁😆😊< /Review>

Train ride only shows 2 animals but u cant seem them anywhere else in the park. Lots of places to sit and snack and bathrooms are in great locations. Staff is friendly but hard to find.

Fun zoo. The prices are affordable and the membership prices are even better. For me the zoo is a perfect Sunday activity. They even have lunch areas for picnic activities! Get there early to ride the gondola before it gets crowded.< /review>

Great zoo! Had a lot of fun. One quibble: in the new North American wing, there is no seating (zero, none at all). It was a problem when we brought my elderly father in law and he started to struggle with the heat. Please install a few benches there!<//text>

<review>My 3 year old LOVES the oakland. The only thing is that it does have lots of hills so wear comfy shoes and definitely take a stroller. It has a nice nature/foresty vibe. Also, trybto eat lunch else wear because the cafe food is expensive. We paid almost $100 for 2 kids meals and 4 burgers.<//review>< username>

Good for a family trip. Gondola and SkyRide are good. Children play area is a plus.
As like other zoos Oakland zoo also has its downside, some animal exhibits needs to be upgraded for the animals.</Review>

pretty good. takes 2-3 hrs to see everything if you really take your time, and 1hr if you zoom through.  we planned going near end of day to get the best chance to see the nocturnal animals like the big cats, and it worked out perfectly.  could not see them around at 2:30PM, but by 5PM they came out and it was nice (esp., hyena, tigers, lions.  they don't kick you out until 5:30PM.  the tram over the africa section is not worth it unless you want to see the awesome west bay vista views or if you could not see the big cats b/c they hide where the tram can see them.</Review>

What a fun place! I'm used to going to the San Diego zoo (which is one of the best in the world!), so I honestly went not expecting much. I'm happy to report that the Oakland zoo was actually fairly big, hosting elephants, giraffes, lions, and much, much more. You won't find any Arctic animals or pandas like in San Diego, but I'd say for the price it's a decent zoo. My two year old and I spent a good 5 hours there, but it could have been longer if we'd bought lunch or gone on the kid rides. I have to say my only complaint is the price of the rides--we didn't go on them because they were exorbitant!<//review>

Lovely zoo with a lot of animals to see.  Parking is hectic to find and it takes a while to get in.  The line to pay was long the day we went and it took a while to pay. Also they didn't provide a map of the zoo when I paid so we just went on our own. The food is expensive inside for just two chicken strips its $10 and a burnt pattie its $12 I think oh well kids were hungry.  They have bungalows that take you on a ride now that is amazing.< /text>

< review>
It was a great experience and my daughter loved it.  The only drawback was the young lady who was operating the airplane ride was extremely rude. One of the planes wasn't working properly.  When the stick is pulled back on, the plane is supposed to go up in the air. This little girl was pulling on the stick and the plane wasn't rising.  The little girl was visibly upset,  she was crying but the young lady operating the ride refused to admit that the ride was malfunctioning.  She refused to let the little girl ride again on a different plane. Plus,  she was extremely rude to three parents standing in line with their children.  Other than that,  the rest of our experience was rather pleasant.  All the other employees were very courteous and kind.</review>

One of the best zoo's I have been to in a long time
Much better than San Francisco zoo. The animal enclosures are dramatically better, both for the animals, and the visitors.</review>

< Review>
Bit expensive for what they offer,  my kid enjoyed seeing the tigers, jirafees, free gondola ride, small roller coaster rides.    Train ride was very bad, 3.5$ per person and just got to see very few animals (3, 4 in total) in the 5 min ride.  Overall zoo had less animal breeds, and few rides (like sky riding which is 3$ per person again).< /Review>

<review>We love the Oakland Zoo and happily renewed our family membership a month ago. Sure the camel "habitat" is just a grassy hillside with a fence around it. Sure the alligators occasionally get loose (we're assured they're overfed and not dangerous, lol). Sure the Sky Ride literally caught fire last time we were there. Whatever. This Zoo has heart, is very manageable and accessible, and my kids love it. I'll keep renewing as long as those things are true.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1523658300712, 'text': 'Thanks for your entertaining review and your continued support!'}< /Response>< GmapID>

Zoo personnel around the grounds are available for questions about the animals.
This is one of very few zoos that has African elephants instead of Asian.  It takes 20 keepers to care for the 4 elephants.
You can visit bars, bugs, reptiles and alligators in the children's zoo and of course , owt the goats.
Newer native animal section at the top of the hill.  Gondolas take you up to the top of the hill to a wheelchair accessible walkway thru native California animal enclosures including Grizzlies, condors, mountain lions and gray wolves.
Get to the zoo when it opens, there's a lot to see and parking fills up fast< /review></record>

This zoo is great for young kids, its affordable, it has the rides, it has enough animals to be exciting, its got great common spaces with grass and jungle gyms. The food is okay but now that they have the gondola, the view from the resturant makes the eating experience special. We can't wait for the new exhibit to open.<//Review>

We are family members and my grandson (now 5 years old) is very comfortable in all parts of the zoo! He loves visiting the animals, riding the train and piloting a plane. The hot dogs are great! This zoo is very walkable and the animals are well-cared for in their environment.<//text>

<review>This is a great place to visit with kids. Small enough to cover all of it in one day and yet big enough for a full day of entertainment. They have a brand new skyride, with a cafe at the top that should open this summer. I just wish that the rides outside didn't exist, they are super old and super expensive in addition to the park entry.<//review><gmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa</gmapID>< resp>

We went at the right time,it was very crowded earlier in the day. Very nice place to go with the fam, but the zoo personnel need to inforce a dress code because no parent want their child to see a female with g-string underwear with see through leggings. Not a good look. Take that to the club!!!! It's a zoo young people! Smh!!!!<//Review>

<Review>Don't go in the winter.  Nearly half the exhibits had animals inside where they couldn't be seen.  The gondola and train was closed which meant another half of the zoo couldn't even be accessed!  Paid a lot of money to see 3 "big" animals.< /Review>< Pictures>

A great place for them to learn about animals from around the world also there's a section for children to ride cars airplanes and roller coaster plus a train ride that's the best around where you can see kangaroos and emos crossing the tracks in front of you. The restaurant just inside the gate has exceptional food including a children's menu with seating inside and outside. There are other attractions such as the sky ride and a cable up to a restaurant on the mountain that has very high ratings. Along the way you pass over Buffalo kangaroos and other animals what you see from the air. There so many species to see it's too long to name here.<//review>< Pictures>

The new gondolas and restaurant are nice, but what I love here are the more natural habitats for the animals. It's relaxing to wander through the paths and see everything there is to see. I prefer this zoo to SF for both my family and class field trips.<//Text>

The new California Trail is AMAZING! There is a kids park at the end that is inventive and exciting for the kids. There is a little stream that the kids can wade through, so be warned. Also, the conservation center is not open on Mondays.< /Text>

The zoo is nice in a very nice setting. It is very hilly so be prepared for a lot of ups and downs. It makes pushing a stroller (especially a double) difficult and I'm sure very tough for a wheelchair. The animal exhibits are decent, especially the giraffes and the elephants. They have a train and gondola ride.<//Review>

I went to the zoo with my 10 yr old grandson. We enjoyed looking at the animals, especially the baboons. Then he rode some of the rides which he liked.< /text>

I love the Oakland Zoo for its manageable size and strong animal conservation education component. The docents are always knowledgeable but not afraid to answer with a genuine "I'm not sure" when asked a tricky question. Memberships are affordable and worthwhile.< /Text>

Lots of fun. Just be prepared to walk. It is in the hills and you have to walk up and down some. Well worth it. In general I am not a zoo fan and it was nice. My kids love it.</review>

Well worth a visit. However, call in advance if you are planning to see the elephants being fed. When we visited with our grandchild, the elephant exhibit was closed with heavy equipment sitting around. However, all the large animals are being fed in the morning shortly after opening. It was interesting watching the giraffe and camels munching on branches that seemed inedible. We especially enjoyed the jaguar, mountain lion, and grizzly bear exhibits (reached by gondola). The black bear exhibit was great. We had a front row seat watching a large bear floating on its back with it's paws up out of the water only three or four feet away through a glass partition.</review>

Smaller zoo. But loved the whole atmosphere.  Has a petting zoo in the kid zone. The new sky track or whatever it's called is cool. You can see San Fran.  Amazing</text>

Located in beautiful Nolan Park the Oakland Zoo is small enough to enjoy in a couple of hours. It's hilly so you get a little bit of a workout. Take the gondola to the top for amazing views of the Bay.<//Text>

For my list, I've created a bucket list of places to go. And they've been to all the zoos beside Oakland zoo. In December, one of my friends went to the Oakland Zoo with her 2 year old and family. She cognizant that Oakland zoo is not huge and not that many animals to see.  Although her reviews were stuck in my heard, I still sought to see for myself.
Entrance- At the zoo parking entrance, you have to pay $10. There were signs posted on the windows of the entrance, credit card system temporarily down and cash accepted. I pretended as if we didn't read the instruction and gave my credit card. They guy said you don't have cash. I replied, no. Then he swiped my card. I guess to speed up at the entrance, they posted those signs.

We purchased the tickets at the  zoo entrance and I kept saying to myself that should have purchased the groupon deal. It was expensive, $19 per adult without tax and for 2 year and up they charge.  I think best time to come to the zoo is in the morning. We reached the zoo at 10.30am and the parking lot was almost full. At the entrance, make sure to grab the map so you don't miss out anything. Once you enter the zoo you'll see the gift shop on your right and the flamingos directly in front of you. Near the gift shop are the restrooms and on the left is the restaurant where we ate.  The gift shop is small but remarkable,  great educational toys, t-shirts, hats, sunblock, puzzles and etc.

Outside the zoo is the Outback Express Adventure Train.  They have a train ride for adults and children that go around the zoo. Every time my daughter see the train, we have to ride. And she loved it. Our conductor did not give much information.
After paying the zoo entrance, we paid additional for the train ride. I felt everything was adding up very fast.

Wear comfortable shoes because there are steep hills in different portions of the zoo.
For the sky ride, you have to pay $ 3per person. I have 9 months old and they charged $3 for the baby. You can see most of the animals through the sky ride and it was totally worth it. I loved the newly opened Gondola ride. It had a beautiful view of the bay area. We saw elephants, giraffes, zebra, turtle, lemur, lion, buffalo, tiger and etc.

Overall, this was a great zoo and I would definitely come back when the new area is opened.</text>

<text>We came from out of town with two young kids who were super excited to see all the animals... only to be rejected at the gate because they don't allow dogs in the parking lot.

The Oakland Zoo has a lot of really interesting animals -- tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, and more. And you can get very good views of all of them. There is also a play area in the middle of the zoo that the little kids love. It's best to take a wagon or stroller to this zoo.</text>

<Review>I really enjoy taking my 5yr old here. We love that we can bring a picnic lunch inside and go to the grass for a afternoon break. Animals are mostly all out in their exhibits but if not, we understand they need a break and that is okay with us. Great teaching place for my son.<//Review>< Pictures>

I love this Zoo! Very informative and the staff is very eager to answer your questions.  I had asked about a cat that I saw with a bib on and this young lady with the goats and sheep answered all my questions.  I wish I had gotten her name,  she was very nice.

My recommendation is to just go!  Go when they open for the best parking and a little more animal activity,  excerpt the big cats. Lol.   Oh, and bring your lunch it's pretty pricey to eat there..< /Text>

<text>Nice zoo, a little on the expensive side.  Park in the lower lot if you want a faster walk to the children's portion of the zoo and you'll wind up with a downhill walk at the end of the day when you are tired.  The cable car is free to the cafe at the top of the hill.  The train and other rides are actually outside of the zoo and an extra expense.</text>< pictures>

I have been going here since I was little and I have always loved it, although the recent remodels have made it even more amazing. The bear exhibit is probably one of the coolest and most upclose i have ever seen grizzly/brown bears and it is really impressive. The people who work here are incredible and super knowledgeable and its just a really awesome place to spend a day. The childrens zoo is really cool too. They also have a few rides, and a zoo train which takes you  around the zoo. The gondolas that take you up to the California exhibit are pretty comfortable even to someone with a fear of heights on a windy rainy day</Review>< rating>

We enjoyed our visit.  Far less stress-free ING then visiting g the SF Zoo.  Parking is sane... admission costs are sane.  We enjoyed everything.  The fruitbats were quite interesting.  Also the teens sitting at the information tables were helpful and good at explaining things to the little kids.<//text>

Although exhibits in itself weren't that great, but the Gondola rides were amazing...
Food cafe on the top of gondola is way too costly and extremely slow in service, esp in the Grill counter.
We waited over an hour in the line to get to order our food.</Text>< pics>

<Review>We love Oakland Zoo.  They work hard to provide human enclosures and treatment for the animals.  Some other posters mentioned trash in the enclosures.  They give the animals different things for enrichment.  What looks like trash is actually for the benefits of the animals to keep them stimulated and healthy.

They also have a fun amusement area outside of the zoo.  You can access those rides without paying for entrance.  My son loves the train.  It takes you to the Australian Outback which has emus, wallaroos and a fantastic view of the bay.

Their annual Walk in the Wild fundraising event is awesome.  We went last year and can't wait to go this year.  It's so much fun.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>The zoo is in disarray and poorly managed. They consistently understaff the gondola, leading to massive lines. Most recently,  roughly 50 members lined up and waited at the completely unstated gondola for about 10 minutes before being told we had to move out to the giraffe area to line up again. I'm writing this while standing in the now scattered line, and the consensus in the crowd is whoever organizes these rules and policies needs to be let go. It's a garbage institution and I'll be canceling my membership<//Text>< Resp>

< Review>
I liked seeing the giraffes! It was not hard for me to walk around the hills and you could see all the animals that were out. The hyenas looked well groomed although they were quiet. I did not have anything to eat here but you are not forced to eat the cafe food as there are benches and grassy areas for you to have a picnic with your own food from home if you want. But it is a bit expensive as you have to pay about $40 for two adults, then extra for rides inside the park, plus $10 parking, and it is not as interactive or with such engaging staff as somewhere like Seaworld.</Review>

Had a great time with family who was in town. I've visited this location several times this past year. Attended their holidays zoo lights, although colder weather in the bay recently it didn't stop us from a visit. The only down side was the chimps at the time was very agitated. Guests had to step away and observe from a distance but otherwise it was still a productive trip. Did the gondola ride. Wondering then the top exit for the California trail will be open.</Text>

The Oakland Zoo gets better every year, the new exhibits are much nicer for the animals.  The new tram ride to the top of the hill is great, the cafeteria is already open there with great food, and the exhibits up there will open in the fall.< /text>

Could use more exhibits and better paths. A lot of the exhibit paths are hidden.

Some of the paths lead to dead ends which make you think there is nothing to see at the end but yet animal exhibits would be there  (like the hyena for example).<//Review>

As far as zoos go, the Oakland Zoo is a gem. Great for kids, a variety of animals including big ones like elephants, tigers, and bears, and beautiful views of the Bay Area from the top of the gondola.< /Text>

Many species of animals , lions, tigers, bears , river otters, alligators,hyenas, etc. I give four stars because of alligator spot is in children zoo and the fence around it is too low so easy to alligators climb it. In my opinion It’s unsafe.<//review>

Their elephant exhibit is great and there is tons of small play areas for my toddler. Problem I have though is there is always trash everywhere, even when we are first ones through the door. Also, some of the animal pens seem too small, specifically thinking about the giraffes and elands. It is easier to get to and park than the SF zoo which is a big plus and tends to be less crowded.<//review>< rating>

<Review>We went on a Sunday. It was very busy, hard to get a good spot to see the animals. There was an area that looked abandon. Just empty exhibits. Unfortunately the Gandola and California Trail were closed durring our visit. Maybe we'll go back and see it again when everything is up and running. Also there is a lot of walking up, and down hill. If that is an issue for anyone just know it's a bit of a work out.</Review><response>{'time': 1548707148591, 'text': 'I would assume your abandoned areas refers to the Rainforest Aviary. We unfortunately lost our gibbon Nikko a few months ago and currently that habitat is vacant. We have plans in the future to fill that space with new tenants so stay tuned. Our Gondola is currently down due to annual maintenance but will be back up and running Feb. 1st so make sure to come back then to visit CA Trail.'}<//response>< Pictures>

A lot of hills so it might be hard for wheelchairs and strollers. I went with a 11 month old and we got pretty tired after 2 hours. Beautiful spot, awesome animals and totally worth it.< /Text>

If you have kids, it is worth it. But be prepared to part with quite a bit of money. If you want to save money, bring your own picnic lunch. A season pass pays for itself after 2 visits.< /text>

The new exhibition is open view and the grizzly bear with wolf, bufalos bison and others it gets more attention. It should have discount for students and AARP, for people low income. Other than that ok.</Review>

Phenomenal Zoo - best one in the Bay Area (or so I've heard).  Seeing the Giraffes is amazing - closest you'll ever get in a zoo in the US.  They have lions, tigers and bears (okay maybe not bears - I forget) oh my.

Good variety of animals - also have some nice kid play areas and structures.  There's a good little creek/pond and hill area where you can walk through.  Their restaurant and food options are meh - so be prepared.

You can get discounts on tickets if you're a member of other parks such as Happy Hollow Children's Park and Zoo of San Jose.</Text>

We love the zoo. I have a three year old and live a couple exits down so we got the membership. It works out that we only need to go like three times a year to make it worth it and with a child our son's age we go way more than that. With the new gondola up and running they are close to almost doubling the size of the zoo.</review>

It's not a big zoo but has all the popular animals, plus sky rides and a train. Perfect for a day trip with kids.</review>

The gondola broke down today 4-1-19.  -no joke-and there are hundreds stuck on top.  There appears to be one shuttle in operation which takes 10 at a time.  After an hour of saying no, we’re finally being allowed to walk down.< /text>

Not that great may be i had high expectations or  may be i have seen better zoos before. Whatsoever i didnt like that the have only one or two animals per section, most of them were sleeping which made my kids so hard to watch them. It is aone time watch.<//review>

Parking has become a nightmare, apparently due to the California Trail exhibit...  Came at noon on memorial day, spent 20 minutes just trying to turn onto the street leading to the zoo!!  Had to turn around and leave after driving an hour to get there.   We are members, and there has been zero communication about the parking woes, despite an April report we later found on ABC7 regarding the nightmare.  Way to treat your members!  Thanks for ruining the day for us!</Text>

We do a zoo trip every fathers day with some friends and were all very surprised by Oakland zoo. The park is clean, the enclosures are large. There are some steep walking paths as the park is situated in hills east if the highway. There is a gondola ride up to a cafe and future expansion, a train ride, and children's carnival type rides.< /review>

Keeping a stroller for younger kids helps. I liked the elephant sanctuary. All the information that you get during feeding time of the elephants is interesting and keeps you engaged.< /text>

The Oakland zoo is the best, they win all kinds of awards, are dedicated to conservation and they are constantly adding new enrichment features to their animals exhibits. They have a huge range of animals as well. Well worth a visit.< /review>

Great upgrades for animals. More space need though. Snack bars are too expensive. $5 for an iced beverage that should've benn at most $3. Same for pop corn.<//Review>

The kids and adults all enjoyed the zoolights and the Gondola and other rides. A lil disappointed with Landing Cafe for very limited selection and unappetizing food. Overall, the visit was enjoyable that I'd recommend for families with kids.< /Review>

Didn't see many animals. Don't know if they were sleeping. Train ride nice, however they need to cute away some of the bushes an trees so You can see more of the view, which is Beautiful. I only saw one gift shop and some of th rides were broke. The food was awful.the pretzel was so hard that girl didn't change me for it. She said all of them were hard Wow Awful.</text>

It was very clean and the staff were friendly when we asked them questions. The Gondala was fun to ride even if the other things were not open yet. Very shady areas even though it was pretty open all around. Didnt get a chance to eat or drink there, but the price is..well pricey but it goes to help the zoo out. The little kid play area also used money to use the rides and the little train ride was worth the 6 bucks for me and my boyfriend <3< /Text>

I really like this zoo for the service and great atmosphere.  One of my favorite parts about the zoo is the train that travels all around the park.  This zoo has a lot of exotic animals and great views and shows I would recommend going to this zoo for all ages.< /text>

I came here for my birthday and it was a nice day. It is very small but I don't mind, the animals seem happy and there is staff available at every exhibit to answer questions. I took a ride on the cable car to the cafe at the top of the zoo and the view at the cafe is really something special.</review>

It's a nice big zoo in Oakland. There are many wild animals at this zoo in big enclosures. It was great to see none of the large wild animals confined to large cages. Those with kids should definitely visit this zoo.< /review>

A small zoo that is expanding.  It's hilly so you get a workout. They could put in more benches. LOVE the gondola! Prices are good.</Text>

<Review>As with any zoo, you're really at the mercy of the animals and if they want to come out.  Good variety in species and geographic representation. The facilities are a little run down and some were under construction, which gives me hope that improvements are on the way.< /Review>< userid>

Quite a lovely zoo. Well-maintained. Not a lot of concessions. I didn't have the overwhelming feeling of animals being oppressed like you get art some zoos. There's a petting area.

If you park at the lower entrance, you'll spend much of your time walking uphill and then had downhill to depart. Parking is expensive. In part to try to push you to get a membership I'm guessing.</Text>

<review>The zoo is a pretty good size for an afternoon trip with kids. It takes about 3 hours to walk around the zoo to see all animals. Visitors are welcome to bring their own food to picnic there as well as have meals there is their various restaurants.
We got a chance to see many animals in action but it's a pity that the distance is too far for phone cameras.

There are a few things to note here though.
1. Kids need admission fee after 2. Unlike SF zoo, which offers kids free until they're 3.
2. Parking fee is $9 per car.
3. They do take 'passport' discount. =D
4. All the rides inside are extra. Sky ride is $3 per person and it's a around 20 minutes ride and you got a good view of the zoo. The play ground area is separated from the zoo and you can enter the area without zoo admission. Most rides there cost $1.5 and $3.

One thing about here is that I wish their staff can be more properly trained. The staff at entrance didn't even greet us and give us a map. Moreover, the staff at various exits didn't even bother to hold door for us even we have strollers, which is quite rude. I take one star off due to this.< /review>< pics>

Though a lot of the place is dated, and could use a renovation, I would still recommend a trip here. A new section of the zoo is slated to open in June I believe, doubling the size of the place. Our kids had a great time and we will definitely be going back.<//text>

This is a pretty small zoo.
All animals was hidden somewhere. No tigers, no lions, no bears....
Other animals were too far to watch them.

No places in the shadow, where we could seat and feed our baby.
Just two small places, where you can eat.

We probably will never return back to this zoo.</text>

Half the Zoo, the new part, is still closed, despite public promotions leaving the impression its open. I just paid full price to cost see half the zoo I expected. Trying not to be bitter. My advice? Wait until this fall, and don't trust the promotions now being aired on public radio and elsewhere.< /Review>

<Time>1501546573447<//Time><rate>4</rate><text>I love the Oakland Zoo. I recently went for my 50th birthday and my kids are grown so I'm not giving a kid or parent perspective. My family no longer visits the rides, but we like seeing the animals even though some are elusive like my favorite Sun Bears. I don't mind. My only complaint this past trip is with the new California gondola ride. It's free and has a lovely view, but after waiting in line to go up you must disembark and wait in a very long slow line at the top just to get back down. We would have much preferred the option to stay on and go back down straight away.< /text>< pictures>

It’s bigger than SF zoo and have more animals.
It is built on a hill so walking with a stroller might be a little tiring. Parking is ok and there are nice picnic areas outside the zoo<//review>

Love this zoo and I dont even like animals. Its better than both the SF and even San Diego zoos.  You can get up close with the animals and it feels nice and new and clean (and not stinky).  There is also a great little rides area for kids.<//Text>

Go early as the lines can get long.
If it's your first time, you'll need 3-4 hours to see the whole thing. Our 2 year old was done in about 3.

Almost all the animals were out and about but the bears were fun to watch. The zoo staff brought the 4 grizzlies close, to feed them fruits and play with them. The black bear cubs were having a blast amongst themselves, climbing on trees and jumping in the water. Don't miss taking the gondola ride to go see them at the California Trail section. Plus the view from the top is a bonus!!<//Review>

I love this place there are a lot of animals to look at and when they put on the shows its cool. The best part are the festivities like Christmas with all the lights and stuff.</Review>

<text>Suitable Place for Kids and Animal Lovers. Gondola, Train and Sky ride(Seperate Fees) is a must see. Not much food options so pack ur bags full. Little confusing routes inside so DONT MISS the map in the entrance. Ample restrooms and play areas are available.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>It is a great place to get your walking in. It is small inclines in areas. The animals look good. Some areas are overgrown with bamboo so you can't see the animals very well. This is likely for the animals sake. The sky tram thing they are building looks like it will be great as long as they keep the glass clean. The only animal that seemed not happy was the Sun Bear. I think this a great zoo with lots of potential for greatness. I gave 4 stars cause there is always room to be great.</text><GmapID>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa<//GmapID><rate>4<//rate><userid>116229092421343997226< /userid>< time>

Came for the last day of ZooLights (Jan 1, 2016); it starts around the beginning of December. Fun little walk with lights and something to do for a date or when you have little kids.

Aside from the reptile house and the insect house, you won't see any animals that you would see during the day.</Text>

<Review>Great zoo.  Animals are much better treated than in the 70s when I first went as a kid.  Great views from New gondolas.  Always something new to notice or your childs development allows him to notice.  Yearly membership is totally worth it.<//Review>< rating>

Great gondola views, but otherwise animal enclosures are mediocre at best. The zoo has a lot of hills as well, so bring good shoes and if you're bringing the kids and stroller, get ready for a workout.<//Review>

A local and small zoo in Oakland. You can see the regular animals here, e.g. lion, tiger, giraffe, zebra and bear... It spend around 3 hrs to visit all the area. There will be an extend area at summer 2018, you can expect of it.< /text>

Great place for kids. They just opened the gondola and the cafe at the top. At the time, they are still renovating. Food was decent but overpriced. Animal selection isn't huge but they have the 'main attractions'.< /Review>

<review>It was well spend Sunday at The Oakland Zoo.
Such a great place for Family fun, get to see many Birds, Animals, inscets, Reptiles. Best part was riding on Cable Trolleys , it was fun...

Another plus point you will get to see small shops for drinks or quick bites almost on every exit.

The only negative point i have being a father of one year old baby i feel like bathrooms were super dirty and chaning diaper  wasnt easy task  i would suggest come prepared....

Other than that staff was really really great. People were really great fully supporting to let others to see the animals  not blocking cages at all.

Great location  alkost cleant except  restrooms.
Must visit.👐</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< Review>
Love the zoo...animals are incredible up close...only reason not a 5 star for me personally is animals being taken out of their natural habitat...but since you cant put them back zoo is a good ,safe place for them where they are well taken care of</Review>

< Review>
It's an okay short zoo if you don't have the whole day to spend at one. There's definitely your typical animal to see, but missing a lot still. At the time i went, there was renovation being done so we couldn't see the camels or bison. You can be done in 1-2 hours. Train ride is short and overpriced for seeing 3-4 animals only.< /Review>

<review>This zoo has most of the animals you expect and hope to see at a zoo, the enclosures are decent sized, and the animals seem to be well cared for. The bathrooms are dated. The rides expensive, so we skip them. I wish there were more zoo staff around to talk to about the animals. And it's sometimes hard to see the animals due to the design of the pens.. which is probably best for the animals, but frustrating for children. Just be prepared for a hike, this zoo is on a hill and is a hike. I personally leave the stroller and take a carrier for my littles.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>A wide variety of exibits with plenty of fun areas for kids and interesting locations for adults, it's fun for all ages. There is a fantastic sky-lift and another under construction, the new one will be even more extensive. There is also a restaurant on a tower being built.<//review>< Pictures>

A nice zoo that isn't big but still good.
Great to take the kids or for a date.
Every k-6 school in the bay area should have field trip here.< /Text>

Very nice zoo, only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because in addition to paying the zoo entry fee, if you want to see the bears, or wallabees, kangaroos you have to ride the train over to see them which is an additional $3 per person.. other than this inconvenience i really enjoyed my time spent at the Oakland Zoo< /Text>

Had a great time with my kids and my mate. We arrived at 10 with our family membership purchase.  Great deal.  Our 9 year old this was her first trip.  She loved it. Love the new Gondala ride. What I like mist as compared to San Francisco zoo is the animals are alor closer, they look healthier and cleaner. We got some great pictures. Looking forward to going back.<//Review>

The zoo is great! My kid had a blast, he was able to run around, take a break to watch the animals and run again.

Parking can be a bit difficult weekend mornings.< /Text>

Pretty underwhelming as far as zoos go. Long lines, strange things way of parking, not a lot of animals. We needed to kill some time before a flight, so it worked out for us, but I wouldn't make a special trip.</text>

<Review>Beautiful grounds. Alot of different animals that look healthy,  well feed, and playful.  Tjis place is 100 acres and feels like Disneyland for Zoos. The gandalos ride is amazing and enjoyable while watching the best views in the Bay Area! Zoo keepers are great and offer great service.  They provided exceptional education about each animal.<//Review>< Name>

A few weeks ago I might have given this zoo only 3 stars because the lower part of the zoo is not extraordinary and it is quite crowded with loud young children. As you can imagine, this doesn't make me or the animals particularly happy. What redeemed all of those things for me was the new zoo expansion, known as the California trail. The area is accessible by a short gondola ride with the greatest view of the entire Bay. The gondola line was somewhat long when we rode up but was fast moving, and it was practically nonexistant when we rode down. The animals in this upper level were all CA animals, either historically (like the wolf and jaguar) or currently. The exhibits for all these animals were new and spacious, expanding the zoo's land area to nearly that of the great San Diego Zoo. I will say this zoo still pales in comparison to the one in San Diego, but is certainly the now best in the whole Bay area, and certainly more than worth the $20 entry fee. If you discounted this zoo before the expansion, I'd recommend giving it a second chance because the view on the California trail is more than worth the entry fee.< /Review>

Didn't realize Oakland had a zoo. It is a very nice zoo. The enclosures seem to be properly sized for the animals which is a nice change from most zoos. The 1 star off is because this zoo is expensive ($10 to enter the park the zoo is in, $22 for zoo admission). Lots of costly add ons (though not required). However, a new board walk section being built with a free gondola ride stands to be a great addition.

This is a good place to visit if you are looking for a different side of Oakland</text>

<Text>After having a membership a few years back and deciding it just wasn’t worth the price to renew the following year, on my most recent visit last weekend, I made sure to go in with a no expectations kinda mindset. Figured I’d enjoy my time roaming the park, maybe ride the train and treat myself to a bag of cold, and more than likely stale popcorn, and if I’m lucky, achieve the impossible by taking a few good family pics. Well, shame on me for lowering the bar of expectation, and ever doubting this amazing zoo, everyone deserves a second chance, thank goodness. To think I could’ve passed up my chance to visit the zoo, never knowing all that I was missing, and depriving my child of some unforgettable memories  she might’ve had while here. To say I was pleasantly surprised by all the new additions and improvements they’ve made
over the past couple of years, would be quite the understatement. From the unexpectedly organized and efficient parking lot, to the outgoing and informative zoo staff I encountered while roaming the paths, everyone just made our experience that much better, so much so that we decided we were long overdue for a family membership to the Oakland zoo. I’m looking forward to the new adventures I have yet to try, and the many more that await us in the future at the Oakland zoo.</Text><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa<//Gmap_id>< user_name>

The Oakland Zoo.  Great family adventure for everyone.  They built a new 'Skyway'.  Very neat.  It ends up on top of a hill to an eatery and wildlife Habitate museum (which was closed for some reason).< /Review>

Our experience at this place was OK. I really cant say that we enjoyed this place because of such a few variety of animals here. And not to mention that the area where the animals are kept is so small. My biggest disappointment was that it was very hard (almost impossible) to spot any exotic birds because the bird cages were dirty and the mesh made it harder to see anything that is inside.< /Text>

<resp>{'time': 1525710415984, 'text': 'Thank you for your review and feedback.  Our new CA Trail exhibit opens this summer which will feature 8 new animals.  The bird exhibits can appear to seem messy, but this is due to a constant stream of enrichment and natural materials that birds tend to shred up with their beaks.  The birds in the rain forest aviary especially have a lot of freedom to choose different areas, so while this provides a higher quality of life for them, unfortunately it can be difficult to spot them.'}</resp><gmap_id>0x808f8f0df97f81df:0x201a254d74ff8aa< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Possibly the best zoo in Northern California and certainly a favorite family destination. One downside is that it is a bit hilly at times, rather steep too, which is challenging if you have strollers. Get the family membership to save money.<//review>

Customer service of the park was nice. The place seems in need of maintenance. Paint is flaking and much more. I so want to give it all 5 stars but I can't.< /review>

It's much smaller than San Francisco zoo. The number of animals here is kind of in the middle of Happy hollow and sf zoon. And you need to buy extra tickets for rides.<//Review>

We haven't been here in a few years and they have really improved on the natural style habitat enclosures. We really enjoyed seeing the animals this way< /Review>

My kids love it here. Also, they have entirely failed to be eaten by animals while here. Also, kudos to the staff for failing entirely to clone dinosaurs and unleash them on an unsuspecting public. that in itself deserves five stars.</review>

A fun mid size zoo. Lots of different animals, our favs were the fruit bats and elephants. The new developments look promising.<//Text>

I had a bad experience at the Oakland Zoo today. My two sons 5 & 8 were looking forward to riding the plane ride that they always ride when they come to the zoo, but this time the ride operator told my son that he couldn't ride because he was too tall. I told her that I had just measured him next to their height requirement sign, and he was definitely under the max height limit which was 58 inches. The ride operator says "he is shorter than 58 inches, but we changed the height limit to 54 inches", I said if you changed it, u should of changed it on the signs, my son has been waiting excitedly in line to get on this ride. The ride operator acted like she didn't care that the sign said 58 inches, so I had the supervisor come down. The supervisor says, even if we go off the posted 58 inches sign, he is still taller, so I put him next to the sign & showed him my son was shorter than 58 inches, and the supervisor like no sorry he can't ride. He had the nerve to tell me that my son's hair counts as height (because my son has dreads that sit up on his head like a high top) so I put his hair in a ponytail to show he wasn't as tall, but he didn't care. I felt like they were intentionally trying to was upset me, yht supervisor saw he was wrong, but wasn't man enough to admit it, and apologize and let my son ride the ride. My son was so excited about going to the zoo, and he was enjoying himself, untill we got to the ride area, he was so disappointed. I will never go there again.</text>

It's a great place with plenty of animals to see. All the shows are catered towards children, as the entire zoo is very children-friendly. To see the Australian animals, you have to pay extra to go on a little train ride, which is too bad.</text>

Was insanely busy. Parking took 30 mins or so.  The credit card terminal was not working so that I could buy a drink after walking around. Places where animals were not available to see. Empty. I did like the newer gondola ride.<//review>

One of my favorite place to visit in Oakland. Beautiful zoo with enough hold and slopes to count as a bit of a workout. Don't miss the acrobatic gibbon, who can't help but entertain and thrill.</review>

<text>Great zoo.  The food is a little expensive, but it is a great place to take kids.  The only downside is that the Oakland Zoo is built on a hillside which means it is a bit of a struggle going from one cage to the next.  Tiresome.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
The size of the Oakland Zoo is perfect for toddlers and children under the age of 10. Having visited both the San Diego Safari Park and the Omaha Zoo with open range enclosures, this small zoo managed to create some open space for the large animals like the giraffes, lions, tigers and elephants rather than enclose them entirely in a cage.   On a hot day, the shaded seats in the outdoor theatre can serve as a sitting area to rest or have lunch when there’s no show in progress.  For those with children, the membership plans can be a good deal with free admission most days of the year.< /Review>

Don't get me wrong, it is fairly good zoo, but I felt like I wanted to see more. First things first. It is conveniently located just one block from highway and entrance is easily accessible regardless where you park. Admission price per adult is $17 which is not bad, but you actually have to pay more. Read until the end.

A few animals that I have seen are baboon, tigers, tortoise, elephants, camels, hyena, giraffes, wallaroo, otters, goats, etc. I have seen all these animals before and wanted to see more birds (only one parrot type, really?).

Some exhibits where closed and I would love to see anaconda, but I couldn't due to remodeling. Definitely there is lack of exotic insects.

The unexpected part was is the way of seeing wallaroo. It is only accessible with the small train and there is additional price of $3 per person for that. I thought that I am paying $17 to see animals.

Overall, it was OK experience, but I am not coming back. Work harder, Oakland Zoo</Review>

<Review>Crowded, and the food options are limited. Park up mountain ave and walk towards the zoo... you will experience garbage like you've never seen.

Great rides for the kids animals are an okay environment could be maintained a little better and updated it's a little old looking but a fun outing for the family. But it's pricey if you don't have a membership!!!</Text>

Had a ball at the zoo! It reminded me of my childhood, when my friends and me used to go to the zoo and to the Knowland Park side of the Zoo. We'd ride the train and the sky lift there was at that time a Rollercoaster ride for older kids,and a Jr coaster for the little kids to ride. Now it's got a few new attraction's! The Gondola ride also the new Restaurant at the end of the Gondola ride. And a host of new Animals and habitats to see and experience< /text>

Various issues with this place. When I visited, there were several closed exhibits. Also there is a $10 parking fee despite the expensive admission. All a let down that could have been avoided by making these visible (if present at all in the website). I can't tell if the Website info is poorly written or purposefully sneaky. But the 2 star really go to the rude parking staff that apparently can't handle a busy day very well.<//Review>

<review>You can see everything in a matter 2 hours if you take your time. Skip the train ride it was so not worth it. They had signs for an expansion in the works including wolves grizzly and other wild life. Check out their website for more detail.< /review>< Pictures>

The night show was disappointing.  A zoo is about animals.   The night show was about pushing people through and getting extra money out of us. There were no animals.  Hopefully it benifits the animals at the zoo that were not out. The day. Time Oakland Zoo is awsome.< /Text>

<Review>The zoo was very disappointing due to the lack of care I has gotten. Every single habitat looked the same with weeds and crabgrass overgrowing everywhere. Tue ride area had attendents that were rude and not able to tell you when  the next train would be. The only nice part of the zoo  was their new attaction that you were taken to via gondilas (the old ones no longer run) to the top of the mountains in which he cafe had a fabulous view.< /Review></record>

Needs more exhibits and not enough animals in each exhibit. Also the wolf exhibit was inaccessable; you can only reach it via a gandola: if you don't mind waiting an hour and a half. Also, we were forced to park on the lawn area which the roads to get there were all muddy dirt, with huge potholes and very uneven ground. Only recommend a truck to park in the lawn area. In addition, there was only one cafe/resturant area to eat so imagine every person in the zoo going there to eat. It's ridiculous. Stay very away from this zoo. On the flip side the works we for the most part polite.< /review>

Very bad zOo.. waste of time and money.. do not recommend.. you start walking around and it's over before you know it.. the train ride to the Australian exhibit is a joke.. there are only maybe a few exhibits worthwhile.. staff was friendly..  should have gone to San Francisco zOo instead.. stay away<//Text>

< Review>
We couldn’t see many of the exhibits because we had to wait over an hour for our food. Even worse, the staff rushed the meals after many were complaining about the wait and served undercooked food. Two people in my family who ate the burgers got horrible food poisoning and were throwing up the rest of the day. I’m very disappointed with our experience here and I hope the others who also ate the burgers today don’t end up in the hospital.</Review>

It's a small zoo, but it has some great animals. You can see all the animals in 3-4 hours. There are some rides for children too!</review>

The Oakland Zoo is a nice zoo with lots of animal exhibits and plenty of vegetation.  The site is a bit hilly so you can expect a couple of steeper climbs but nothing so tough you can't handle on foot but would be a real effort for a wheelchair.</Review>

It's closer than the SF Zoo for people in the East Bay. That's about all that's really good about it. A lot of animals are hard to see for smaller kids, and often unnecessarily so, e.g., by painting a glass wall over. The staff is rarely helpful, most of the times they are more on the rude side. It's pricey and the rides are annoying. The kids always want to go to the rides instead of visiting the animals. It's my least favorite zoo but it's close enough to be convenient for a short morning entertainment, so I got a membership. After 11:30 AM it gets too full anyways.</Review>

It's Rundown but it is a lot of fun, if you like looking at animals in cages.</Text>

The zoo is a great place to spend a day with the kids.The new part of the zoo is fantastic.If you are afraid of heights you might not get to see the new part as the only way to it is by tram.The size of the zoo has doubled in size so there will be a lot of walking.The wolves are awsome to see.There is a male and a female.Just fyi the prices have gone up quite a bit also from tickets to get in to the food prices.On the weekends parking is horrible and traffic to get in even worse.All in all the Oakland Zoo is a fun place to go with or without kids.<//Review>

We had fun. There are a lot of animals to see, food is available and two trams to ride to overlook the zoo.< /Review>

<Review>The rides (junior rollercoaster, carrousel, etc) + zoo combo is great for kids, you can stretch to a whole day event! The zoo is great with plenty of open exhibits (elephants, zebras, lions, camels, giraffes, crocodiles, giant turtles, etc) , and specialized areas (rain forest snakes and frogs, desert lizards, etc).< /Review>< gmap_id>

The Oakland Zoo always makes for a fun few hours. My favorite animal from when I was a kid was the Siamang Gibbon who had the loudest voice I've ever heard. He was always our first stop on any visit.

The zoo seems to be keeping up with the times and modernizing when money allows. Luckily the zoo will be allowed to expand into Knowland Park.<//text>

I liked it very much it was very quiet not a whole a lot of people to day . However it was little chilly to day but very nice weather. I even got to talk to some decents about the Lions and chimpanzees as well.<//Review>

I prefer this zoo over SF zoo. Its pretty nice and in a really good location on top of the hills. Lots of animals and trees. Food is ok and the gift shop is ok. Parking can be a pain if its a busy day but I've never really had a problem with it.</Text>

what a great day at the zoo...my only complaint would be the gondola ride. once at the top. to get down you stand in a line that long and there is no protection from the wind. for me not to bad but for my parents and my children it was a long cold wait no structure to ther system of loading people..we all had jackets. dont forget yours. also the doors at the cafe up on the hill wouldn't stay closed and the wind swept through the whole cafeteria and your food cools quick. bring water of your own or else bring a lot of cash. 6$ for a sm bottle. but over all a great day for my whole family<//Review>

< review>
Very conflicted about this Zoo. On the one hand, they way the animals are kept rub me the wrong way, on the other hand how else do I expose my kids to animals other than raccoon and deer? While there with my kid the chimps were very agitated and didn't like the huge crowd watching them. The glass we were standing in front of broke when one chimp threw itself against the glass. We made the determination not to spend money here. And yet, I go back with my kid, because I have a kid, and they like zoos. Ignorance is bliss I suppose and you're never too old to be a hypocrite. Sigh.<//review>

<text>Not enough signs...didn't know there were 2 entrances.  Not correct info about feeding the giraffes.  VERY DISAPPOINTING...that was the reason we came.  Got over charged for a soda...when asked worker how much they were...he mumbled..."I dunno"....needed handicapped parking...directed the other way.  Took 2 hours to find out way out...with the map.   Not coming back.< /text><Name>Karen Urrutia<//Name>< date>

< review>
You would think by having the San Francisco Zoo, it would be enough, but we have another zoo across the bay, which in size, is not as enormous as San Francisco's but I think is just as enjoyable.

It offers residents in the Eastbay easy access for that "zoo fix" in most of us!  I like the easy access from the freeway (Highway 580) and the large parking lot which is in front of the zoo.

With this zoo, you are walking up and down small hills to view the numerous animals but "my favorite part of the zoo has to be the sky-ride."  I believe the San Diego Zoo is the only other zoo in California that is equipped with a "tram-like" ride over the zoo, but this one is a "ski-lift" type of ride, which I think is one of a kind.

The lift takes you over the lion's den and giraffe prairie and gives you a whole new perspective from above!

Another favorite attraction of mine is the meerkat exhibit where in the wild these animals live in large "clans" and to me is just entertaining to watch.</review>

Our son loved the Oakland Zoo, we got there when it opened and had a great 1/2 day (as that was all he could handle) we went back on Sunday to see the rest.  Loads of animals to see, you get really close and exhibits are close enough but a good spacing where you dont feel cramped.  The terrain is a little hilly though so I dont think I would bring grandparents as its a lot of up and downhill walking to certain parts.</text>

I think occasionally the Oakland zoo as being smaller, but in better shape than the San Francisco Zoo.  I probably prefer the Oakland zoo.</Text>

Part of the fun coming here is seeing the struggle of the out of shape humans struggling with the hilly terrain. The giraffes, elephants, baboons, and bats are my favorite here. Bring good walking shoes, a stroller for the little ones, and plenty of water.< /Text>

< Review>
A great place to take the kids to see a wide variety of animals.  This zoo has done a lot over the years to greatly increase the size of the animal enclosures.  You'll see African elephants, tigers, meerkats, zebras, lions, giraffes, camels, bison, a wide variety of birds, sun bears, baboons, monkeys, etc.  Included in the zoo is a children's zoo featuring repitles (including alligators), amphibians, various bugs & insects, fruit bats, lemurs, and more.  A separate train ride just outside the zoo gates will take you through an Outback with some Australian animals wander about.</Review>

There were animals here.  I was shocked.  They had lions and tigers and bears oh my.  They also had some arrogant giraffes who thought they were "all that and a bag of chips", but I didn't let them spoil our day.< /Review>

LOVED IT!! First time going to the Oakland Zoo. Kids had a blast seeing the animals & going on the rides. The main restaurant by the entrance was rather SLOW!! I waited 45 mins to 1 hour for our food. (unacceptable). Simple food like hot dogs, grilled cheese, nacho's took for ever!!
All in all it was an amazing quality time family day!!

Going back Dec 2- Jan 1 for Zoolights!!< /Text>

<name>Gilbert Rader< /name><text>Wasn't very impresssed. It wasn't very hadicapped friendly for a person such as I. Walking trails were VERY UNEVEN and dirty with leaves and branches. Was extremely difficult for a wheelchair person to get around without help. Animal collection was fair. Loved the Meercat exhibit because you could see them fairly upclose. They were certainly well fed!!! Felt some of the cages were too small and unkempt, poorly constructed, and the visibility to the animals was poor as well. All in all I would rate it a 5 out of 10. Sorry, but I won't be planning a return trip anytime soon.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>We love the zoo! It focuses on safari and jungle animals and is currently missing california animals, but there is a california animal exhibit under construction. It's got lots of seating around the major habitats, like the elephants and monkeys. And it's got a great kids zoo. There are big animal statues to climb on all over and there is a petting zoo where the kids can pet/brush goats. The only downside is it's built on a hill, but that means you get a good workout! There is a small attached amusement park with rides you can pay for. There's also a train that goes around the zoo and a skylift that flies over it, though both of those cost money too. There are two train crossings, which my toddler loves! Its a great zoo and open all year round.< /review>< user_name>

Went to see the Christmas lights.  It was nice and I know it's a zoo, but there were very strong animal smells in parts of it, and it gives the impression that the animals might be living in a dirty environment< /review>

If you're in a pickle and don't know if you should select SF Zoo or Oakland Zoo. No brainer! Choose Oakland. 👍<//Review>

The only bad thing about the zoo, is the microscope, because it was too high for my kids, especially the one in the Bamboo exhibit. Other than that, it's great!</Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>I was very suprised at this zoo, It is by far the best zoo in the area. There are lots of viewable animals and the park is very clean and well kept. When my wife first mentioned the Oakland zoo I thought to my self a zoo in Oakland, I wonder how getto that will be. I must say upon my arrival at the zoo I was more than suprised. This Zoo is well worth the trip.< /text>< UserId.>

Very disappointing to spend $60 for 3 Adults an one 20 month free. By the time you add $10 for parking, it was too much.  Oakland wastes too much $$$  the so-called protesters and not enough on the Zoo.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Beautiful Zoo, animals are clearly well taken care of and seem happy. However not one of the staff members seem to have a happy bone in them, everyone from the entrance, to the gift shop, to the exit seemed to hate being asked questions or talked to.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIaK3-wAovNsFjqFR7IFfe3FtH4p-H0vCorRbV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Wow. The upgrades to Oakland Zoo just made the entire experience BETTER than the San Diego Zoo which we JUST went t a few weeks ago. The Gondola to the Cafe then the California Trails were out of this world.<//Review>

We had so much fun. There isn't a lot of food options but we were able to bring some snacks and water bottles in. Wasn't crazy busy even on a weekend, but that's probably because you had to reserve your time for going. All the staff seemed friendly and helpful. Did get a little lost a few times but that may be user issues.<//review>

(Translated by Google) It is very nice to return to the zoo and see the children happy to see the animals again ... it really is very good for the children to enjoy and forget a little about the confinement that we all went through at COVI 19

(Original)
Es muy bonito regresar al zoológico y ver a los niños felices de volver a ver a los animales...de verdad que es muy bueno para que los niños disfruten y olviden un poco el encierro que pasamos todos por el COVI 19< /review>

(Translated by Google) Although it is a corona wreck, I visited in February 2021 when it was reopened due to a lot of efforts to ensure safety.

You can ride a gondola, and in normal times there are merry-go-rounds and various children's attractions, so it's perfect for playing with children.

Not all elephants are in San Francisco Zoo!

(Original)
コロナ禍ですが、安全性を確保するためのたくさんの努力によりリオープニングした2021年2月に訪れました。

ゴンドラに乗ることができたり、平時であればメリーゴーラウンドや様々な子供向けアトラクションも併設されているため子供との遊びにぴったりです。

サンフランシスコズーにはいない象もいます！< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The zoo is nice many animals to see and much to walk, what I do not like is the price of admission we are 5 in the family and if I did not have the memebresia it would be very difficult to visit it. It is more convenient to have definitive membership.

< Text>
(Translated by Google) The most beautiful zoo I've ever seen. Animal enclosures are beautifully elaborated and maintained. You can see that they take care of the animals. The funicular at the zoo completely thrilled me and took us to a distant hill where there were several other pavilions. There is also a restaurant with very reasonable prices. The staff are very nice here. Admission was $ 24 per adult.

(Original)
Nejkrásnější zoo, kterou jsem kdy viděla. Výběhy pro zvířata jsou krásně propracované a udržované. Jde vidět, že se tu o zvířátka hezky starají. Lanovka v zoo mě úplně nadchla a vyvezla nás na vzdálený kopec, kde bylo zase několik dalších pavilonů. Je zde i restaurace s velmi příznivýmu cenami. Zaměstnanci jsou tu strašně milí. Vstupné bylo 24 dolarů na dospělou osobu.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The site is very beautiful but I do not think there are many animals. They have tried to keep the animals in something similar to their habitat and sometimes can not be seen easily. I think the tickets are expensive for what they offer. $ 24 per person. Seniors 20 dollars. One of the attractions is the funicular that takes us to a viewpoint of the entire bay of San Francisco. This is spectacular.

(Original)
El sitio es muy bonito pero me parece que no hay muchos animales. Han tratado de conservar a los animales en algo parecido a su hábitat y aveces no se les puede ver con facilidad. Las entradas me parece que están caras para lo que ofrecen. $ 24 por persona. Adultos mayores 20 dolares. Uno de los atractivos es el funicular que nos lleva a un mirador de toda la bahía de San Francisco. Esto es espectacular.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The zoo is beautiful, a super cool place to take the kids, great for picnics, the gondola ride has an amazing view! Healthy and well maintained animals! Good habitat reproduction of animals!
The children loved it, go with comfortable clothes and shoes, because the walk is long !!

<rate>3< /rate><text>(Translated by Google) Good city zoo and with enough parking spaces. The zoo is reasonably priced for a 1 round zoo. It is under development and the stays are good, but could be better. The lions were well housed and the elephants had some space. It is a pity that the voilieres have a lot of thread, but for the small children it is a great educational zoo. The alligators and bats are beautiful. Close to and for a European once not in a blood hot hall.

(Original)
Goede stadsdierentuin en met voldoende parkeerplaatsen. De dierentuin is redelijk aan de prijs voor een 1 rondje dierentuin. Het is in ontwikkeling en de verblijven zijn goed, maar kan beter. De leeuwen waren goed gehuisvest en de olifanten hadden wat ruimte. Jammer dat de voilieres veel draad hebben, maar voor de kleine kinderen is het een prima educatieve zoo. Wel mooi zijn de alligators en vleermuizen. Dichtbij en voor een Europeaan een keer niet in een bloed hete hal.< /text>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Wonderful zoo. With my 4.5 year old daughter we stayed there all day. She also enjoyed petting goats, the small play area on the side of the gondola, as well as the rides before heading home. Plan some snacks, there are plenty of cool places to have a picnic.

(Original)
Magnifique zoo. Avec ma fille de 4,5 ans on y a passé toute la journée. Elle a également apprécié le fait de caresser des chèvres, la petite aire de jeux du côté des télécabines, ainsi que les manèges avant de rentrer. Prévoyez des encas, il y a pleins d'endroits sympas pour picniquer.<//Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Great zoo. Parking lot 10 dollars. Otherwise the entry is cheap. The reason for 4 points instead of 5 points is that the enclosures of the elephants, coyotes & the lions were "closed". Clean zoo.

<text>(Translated by Google) A very nice zoo for you to take your children. What I like the most is when you get on the baskets, and look down at the lions 🦁, let me run where the baskets break and you fall, .. you will be fresh meat for the lions 🦁 ... I recommend them everything is very beautiful ... 🤞🏿👈👍🏾

(Original)
Un muy bonito zoológico para que lleves a tus hijos.lo que más me gusta es cuando te subes a las canastillas,y miras abajo los leones 🦁,que mello ejejje en donde se llegue a romper la canastillas y lleges a caer,..serás carne fresca pa los leones 🦁...se los recomiendo los todo está muy bonito...🤞🏿👈👍🏾<//text>< pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) The ticket is too expensive .. If you have a lot of children you pay quite a bit .. they don't have anything for coupons .. And the zoo is pretty spoiled .. it doesn't have anything anymore .. they should invest more in the zoo for the price one pays we deserve plus..

(Original)
Es demasiado caro el ticket.. Si tienes muchos niños pagas bastante.. no tienen nada para cupones.. Y el zoológico está bastante detiriorado.. no tiene nada ya.. deberían de invertir más en el zoológico por el precio k uno paga merecemos más..< /text>< Name>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very good zoo, more diversity of species is needed, the existing ones are very well cared for and some facilities are large. The Sun Bear is not common in zoos, the gondolas are a super plus, the view is truly spectacular, it is included, although 22 dollars per adult the entrance is expensive in my opinion. In the summer of 2018 there will be new attractions, such as the California Conservation Habitarium, facilities for Grizzly Bear, Condor Jaguars, Cougars, among others.
Current installations such as that of the Muntiac are on a steep slope, so they are never seen. Enjoy it.

(Original)
Muy buen zoologico, hace falta mas diversidad de especies, los existentes se ven muy bien atendidos y algunas instalaciones son grandes. El Sun Bear no es común en zoologicos, las gondolas es un super plus, la vista de verdad es espectacular, esta incluido, aunque 22 dlls por adulto la entrada a mi parecer es costoso. En el verano de este 2018 habrá nuevas atracciones, como el california conservation habitarium, instalaciones para oso grizzly, condor jaguares, pumas entre otros.
Instalaciones actuales como el del Muntiac estan sobre una pendiente con mucho desnivel, entonces no se ven nunca. Disfrutenlo.< /review>< userid>
