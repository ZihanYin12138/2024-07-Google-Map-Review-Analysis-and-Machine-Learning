The owner is extremely rude. My mother washes clothes here and I always get her money changed into quarters before she comes because I pay for it. He kicked me out and took pictures of my car and told me and my mother not to come back because we change want too much change. Every other week I get 20 dollars in quarters for my mother to wash. We will no longer be coming here.</Text>

Most unprofessional service ever.  Old machines and surrounded by homeless people.  Trust me the owner is rude and refuses to take responsibility for bad service .  I can't believe this place is still in service after years of mistreating the community.  I wish i would have read the reviews before going.  Spend your hard earned money somewhere else.</text>

<text>The owner was not nice. I come here all the time. I usually use my walker to sit down. I had just been released from hospital November 18th. Im still gaining my strength back. I sat down to rest on a bench and hit my head on a wood ply window frame. I told the owner he had no compassion. He never even asked me if I was okay. I also lost my grandmother's ring while putting my close in. He was no help at all. Said nothing he could do about. Then he told me not to come back to his laundry mat.  Because I hit my head. Not to mention I'm on a blood thinner. I asked him to make an incident report just in case I have issues from bumping my head. NEVER ASKED IF I WAS OKAY. SO COLD HEARTED.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

This place has the worst customer service. If the machines don’t do their job they will not have any kind of compensation for the quarters you’ve used on the machine. They forced me to take out my wet clothes from the machine and asked me to pay for another machine just because their machine was malfunctioning. The only good thing about this place is the 7/11 that is conveniently located near the laundromat and that’s about the only thing that they have going for them. This laundromat is so bad I felt inclined to write a review for the first time. I would not recommend this place to anybody.< /Text>

I also love the 6 load washer that was awesome and you can see how well it washes your clothes! If you’re looking for an adventure..this is the spot.< /Review></record>

<text>This place is super sketchy I would suggest not going here unless you either either really clouds or have no other alternative.I'm not sure if it's just the location or my horrendous luck but there always seems to be women of ill repute present when I go to that laundromat. And I was saying Rihanna the four times I've been there the police have been there on a call for various reasons. Now with all that being said the inside is really clean and the machine seem to work with no issues.the only problem I have on the inside is that they charge you a quarter to use the restroom you've already made your money off of me doing my laundry don't keep doing the cash grab thing.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80d9584d6cc69f77:0x41374a7d31f22495</Gmap_id></record>

Good place to wash clothes. If ever the machine took your quarters, the ladies that work there will give u the missing quarters. Children friendly environment. Basically come if u need to wash ur clothes. Ignore the negative comments, it's all exaggerated.<//Text>

This quaint little market is in an unknown area of Oakland. They have an excellent and diverse selection of pastries, produce, beverages, deli, packaged goods and pretty much anything you could need. The prices are high, but the location is a bit obscure so it is kind of a funny little place. Parking is super easy, they have a lot of spaces right outside. They also have four tables to sit out should you choose to sit outside and enjoy something you purchased.< /Text>

We have been in the neighborhood for 50 years, and Village Market is one of our favorite markets. Lots of yummy stuff. Most of the staff are awesome, but a couple of checkers don't make me feel welcome...< /Review>

Well stocked, friendly staff, careful with Covid-19 precautions. This store is tiny & pricey, but well worth it. Small business that keeps more than their neighborhood happy< /Text>

<Review>I’m a Doordash driver, I got a delivery to this grocery store and they left me a very generous tip; of which I used some to buy some groceries in this beautiful store! Not only everything looks delicious and fresh but the staff is amazingly nice and helpful, the manager I think his name is Keith was so sweet and kind, loved my experience here and so grateful! Thank you 🙏💕<//Review>< pics>

While I can not physically change our store layout at the registers to clear up the confusion (we have tried different configurations), I would like to know who you had a negative experience with.  Our customer experience is very important to us!!\n\nPlease feel free to call and speak to me directly at 510-547-3200.\n\nRegards,\n\nKeith Trimble\nOwner'}< /response>

<Review>Best chille rellenos on Friday. Nonpariel!< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<text>Friendly staff for the most part. Lots of great stuff. If you visit Hot Bar do it early in the day. It's not replenished enough & food gets over cooked from sitting. I made that mistake twice & had to throw it out..and it's NOT cheap!  Everything though is WAY over priced. Expect to pay 2 1/2 times more then any other market. Also, 3 times now I've purchased out dated food!!! Watch out for there pre made & packed fresh"supposedly" fesh foods! Sandwiches in particular.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Great little market, but prices tend to be high. Staff is helpful. You can buy ready-made hot food. I often go here when I need just a few items.<//Review>

Small neighborhood market that's jammed to the rafters with everything you could need. Great hotu bar, cold bar, and deli.
It's not cheap but it's close and clean and well run.</review>

<Text>Really like the bbq to order and meat counter - excellent marinated meats, fish. Good produce, nice cheese and wine selection. I can get everything I want on a shopping run here. But really, it is the bbq and meat counter that make this market shine.</Text><response>None<//response>< user_name>

<review>This market has excellent fresh fruit and meat. There is a salad bar as well.All the

selections are high quality.Staff helpful and pleasant.My only caveat is that it is expensive....perhaps because they are located in a high rent district.Not a place to buy ordinary staples but for special occasions it is perfect.< /review>< Pictures>

Management are rude and seem to treat you nice, but behind your back they are talking about you. The owner is very special and hired me just for the holidays after hoildays were over he fired me without giving me a reason. I think it was very unethical and very unprofessional of him to do that. Also some of his employees that been there for a very long time are stealing from him, but yet he still has them working for him. Once again this is one of the worst companys to work for they just use you and when they don't need you, you get fired. DONT WORK FOR THEM</review>< Rating>

I am happy to have the Village Market: they have a bunch of hard-to-find items in their compact shop: hot soups and other ready-to-eat items; fresh BBQ on the weekend; a British foods section; Propane gas exchange; organic produce; butcher; tasty baked goods.   Their prices are higher but so is the quality.   The staff is friendly.  They often have 10-20¢ mini avocados.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Village Market surprised me in two ways the first time I shopped there.  The first:  I was amazed at the quality of foods and meats available there.  I had no idea they would carry such quality like grass fed and organic everything!  The second surprise:  it is definitely more expensive than Whole Foods.  The part that keeps me coming back is the service.  I am hoping the extra money we spend there goes to the workers because they are worth it.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Village Market in the Broadway Terrace neighborhood is so amazing for a small market. You walk in to samples galore, several different types of cheeses and crackers, guacamole, several salsas and the tortilla chip of the day....sometimes even a locally made cake or two. Seriously, one of the best local produce markets in Oakland and on weekends, a bbq including pork ribs, tri tip and chicken. Worth the trip from anywhere in Oakland, vote with your fork and buy local at Village Market!﻿<//text>< resp>

We are happy to address your concern and provide more training for any of our employees.  If you could provide me us with the day and approximate time you were in the store that would be helpful.  Also the employees name.  We do not currently have an employee in our meat department named Francisco.\n\nThanks again for the review.  I look forward to addressing this issue together!\n\nRegards,\n\nKeith Trimble\nOwner'}</resp>< Gmap_id>

The store has a massive selection, you can get whatever you need. If you need it ordered, it’s done. They’re super reasonable, humble, and welcoming.

Picked up a new nail, and a g pen connect. Super super fair on price.

Coming back again 100%, thanks again.< /Text>< user_id>

Great tobacco and paraphernalia shop! The staff is super great and easy to talk to. Met Chris today, and dude was such an amazing and friendly salesman, with such high energy, I went in there planning to spend $15, and ended up walking out over $80 lighter! We'll put together shop, tons of cool stuff, and Chris was really patient with me about answering all my questions about CBD, since I've been thinking about trying it out for my chronic back pain and insomnia. All in all, great experience, and would definitely recommend!!! Am going back for SURE!!!</text>

I drive by 3 other smoke shops to get here because know I am guaranteed to get what I need when I go there.

I had been on the hunt for a Puffco Peak and was unable to find one local or online. I remembered this gem from a while back and gave them a call, to my luck they not only had what I was looking for but also a few accessories. I see why my buddies kept telling me to check it out.

They had a multitude of other choice of vapes and other items in the shop all at a more then reasonable price. Chris and the other gentlemen that work there are awesome. If you're looking for a place to get your vape or any other item where you don't have to wait or doubt your go to will have it in stock, then this is definitely the place for you.<//Text>

Terrible service. I was rushed out after being there for 5min. The young guy with the beard working was very rude. Everything was over priced aswell. Save your money and time, go anywhere else.< /Text>

Good shop.  They have add much more stuff so go check it out.  Now that people are vaping essential oils and various herbs for health benefits, you can find equipment for that as well as the regular equipment for pot.  LOL.< /Text>

Dont buy here. They will not stand behind their products. He tells you before pay any problems bring back and he will take care of it.
Couple years ago i buy a lighter for $30. Lifetime warrantee be tells me. When i get home is doesn't light. I fill it butane, light it and it blows up on me. He told me it was my fault. He didnt even ask if everyone was ok.

Sunday i buy a tank to vape with. I get home fill with juice and it leaks really bad. I take it back after 10 min of listening to his bs he tells me I'm doing it wtong. He tells me you don't the tank. This kind of tank you put drops on the coil.  This guy really thinks im stupid.

Its a cheep knock off but i found it on the internet with pdf version of instructions. I also paid double on it

Im going to give him one more chance to fix this problem.

WEEKEND. UPDATE.. THEY WON'T EXCHANGE THE TANK. THEY WANTED TO SELL ME ANOTHER ONE.

I was in the automatic transmission industry for almost 30  years i never stole, cheated or sold infereer parts
to a customer.  Almost all our customers were repeat. New customers would come in saying
We were recommended.

I will never spend money in that place. To the five star  reviewers.  Go try to return or exchange someghing. I bet your star rating changes.</Text>

I admire this spot! They serve splendid meals, their menu is rich, The cook in that spot is very trained, I enjoy a lot tasting all their food. The dishes are always good, the attitude towards the clients  is good. I often eat in this place and I was never unsatisfied. I recommend this place.</Review>

Good amounts of meat for me , birria plate was pretty damn good, don’t know if it was because i was hungry, or the birria was just good but i loved it! Consome with the birria was great, beans and rice were so salty though so thats a star down. Pretty good birria though< /Text>

Small place, good food. Extremely slow service. I dread the wait. Called it in for pick up, they said 20 minutes. Gave an extra 10 to get there and wait another 30 minutes. Just for a plate of menudo seemed excessive. Last 2 visits were a very long wait. Wish they could adopt a faster way to service.</text>

One of the best spots for authentic Mexican food, so much different than taco truck tacos, hand made tortillas and everything has that homemade flavor.
If you can, please eat here.</Text>

<Review>This place is the definition of homemade mexican cooking. It's like a hole in the wall place. You'll never know it's there but glad you do. Oddly enough their signature dish birria isnt my favorite but my parents swear by it. Everything else is amazing. Also this isnt some millennial place where you can order by phone and have food waiting, or expect uber or postmates whatever. Come here order here and eat here. Dont drag the score down making this place something it's not.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

They are remodeling, so it was a little strange waking in and not knowing where to go. The security man at the door was really nice and courteous, opening the door for me. They are very professional in this store and that goes a long way. Keep up the good work guys! 💜💜</Review>

Place is nicely laid out with great selection of flower and concentrates. Though the buds can be a little pricy like most dispensaries, they always have smaller bud deals that are reasonable, usually avg. 8 bucks a gram. Plus they have the best quality and best price concentrates than any dispensary I've ever been to.</review>

<Text>For its location, it is a great small dispensary. Great customer service with a knowledgeable staff person. However there was only one bud tender on a holiday weekend, and it's the 1st. The waiting lounge was very comfortable though. It was nice to socialize with other people in the community. It was also pet friendly. Our little guy seemed to make everyone happy as usual. 🐶 😉</Text>< name>

<date>1535569069780</date><review>Very nice & helpful staff. Good selection, unfortunately, at the time, they had a limited supply of plants. It was explained that in the spring they have a better selection, as a bulk of their customers grow outdoors. The girl behind the counter was great in helping me find what I needed to help with my pain. She gave several recommendations, & I am loving what was recommended!

Great dispensary. Good selection.  Good place to take people new to cannabis. Try the local light dep flower before you spend unnecessary money on the indoor flower.....trust me!</review>

I believe this is going to take the place as my go to shop as the other store I was going to has become sorta off putting and a little rude most times I've been in there lately.. just because I don't get to go in very often is no reason to be condisending when I do!! But enough about the other shop, THANK GOODNESS I decided to go to Lakeside Herbal Solutions, everyone was very friendly and smiling. I got nice product and the price seemed fair... (Unlike the other place where the prices keep going up and up and up, wth?)< /text>< pics>

UPDATE: I've learned a lot since my first review. The prices here are outrageous. A slightly longer drive to Ukiah saves a ton. I made the mistake of not doing my homework today and got some terrible advice from the girl behind the counter. She was really nice but I paid top dollar for the lowest THC concentrations there were. I guess maybe no one was buying them? I wouldn't have either! I got home and looked at the website but I didn't have my glasses with me when I was out. Doubt I'll ever go there again. They got 2 stars because #1 they exist and serve this community and #2 they deliver in Lake County.</text>

Worst dispensary ever!!!! I tell you what in Santa Rosa King's Garden is 30 a gram at Lakeside 55 and they're trying to blame it on taxes?TF<//review>

< Response>
{'time': 1547653462806, 'text': 'Can’t  make everyone happy as we don’t make the prices.  King’s garden is actually around $55-$60 an eighth out the door here which equates to around $15 a gram.  We don’t sell grams of king’s garden flower.'}< /Response>

<Text>I've been here last Sunday with my father and my sister. We've never used a gun except for my father. The employee (KEN) is super nice and he explains very easy, simple and FUNNY. It is very nice place to have fun.
We spent near $200 and it is worth:D! Anyone who looking for gun range, I highly recommend this place and each person appropriately needs around $50!< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Love this place! Will be coming back. We had an AK47, 9mm Glock, and a revolver. My favorite and easiest was the AK. Also I didn't get to try the revolver! But next time! We had a group of 6 and about 180 bullets. Prices are great and the staff is really helpful and friendly.< /text><Time>1602146128686<//Time>< Resp>

< Review>
Triple B Clays is one of the better shotgun sport facilities in the Los Angeles area. The well stocked shop is well staffed, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. A large variety of shotguns are available to rent if, like me, you didn’t arrive with your own. The trap and skeet stations are kept mechanically sound and clean.

Recent heat and humidity slowed me down during this last visit but resting between rounds at the shaded benches located at most stations helped get me through six rounds of trap.

If all goes well, I hope to shoot at Triple B Clays again soon.<//Review>

<Review>Didn't like this place, took some friends before they were closing and asked us to take their test.
Shocker no one passes, one of the instructors told us..
I went with my 500 but was told I wouldn't be safe with my own firearm?
Oh didn't i mention they went bankrupt right after... just saying.</Review>< pics>

<Review>So how does one spell extreme enjoyment, fulfilling dreams, been there doing what he loves & gets to view something he dearly loves, yes they’d be Triple B’s Clay’s! I can’t express just how much I’ve enjoyed discovering it about 60 days ago. I can tell you I’d drive 200 miles round trip just to enjoy this remarkable facility, actually we do, we live in Escondido. Ok you know we’re going to get nailed in rush hour traffic at one time or another just to have a great time, guess what, for us it’s worth it! Not only is it beautiful from this shooter’s perspective, the staff is always cordial, friendly and a pleasure to be around.

Thank you for your continued efforts,

Great place to teach anyone how to shoot.  Especially the sporting clays area.   It's shaded with benches and has a very nice trail to walk. People are friendly and the working staff there are helpful.</review>

<text>Got an email that the Beretta rep was going to be there on 5/5 so I made a day of it to go shoot some clays and see about a new shotgun. Rep was nice and answered all my questions. The real treat came after I went in to talk to the staff. Really really nice people. Friendly, knowledgeable, no pressure, total great experience, and yes I did grab a new A400.< /text>< pics>

Staff is friendly and helpful. The sporting clays course is well laid out. Each station is shaded with large trees. I've never had any problems with the clay launchers. There are 14 stations open to the public with more open for members. The little sandwich shop is tasty.<//Text>

<Text>I would give them a negative if I could
I took my two adult nephews there to let them experience a shotgun.   I asked at the office if there were any open spaces since we were tight for time the young lady said yes.   I paid for two rounds for each of us I paid for 150 rounds of ammo.  I was not that concerned with the cost since it was to be a fun day with my nephews.   We walked out and found that that 8 and 9 were being used even though she said we could go shoot right away.   We waited and waited and waited.   I was next so I took one of my nephews an placed my key into the machine for us to go shoot.   Two older men stepped in front of me and stated what do you think you are doing?  I stated I am going to shoot some clay pigeons with my nephew.   The older man told me not just the two of you you aren't I explained I had paid a decent sum to shoot and they had me read the rules and I saw no such rule that I had to share my time with others.   He almost got in a physical altercation with me.   Needless to say both my nephews got to shoot one round of 25 shells they didn't get to shoot a second and I didn't get to shoot at all.  We ran out of time.   They should be more upfront about availability and their rules of the range.   They don't refund unused rounds and don't take back ammo.   I won't use this place ever again.</Text>< pictures>

A great time with friends and family.   Instructors cost $60.00 hr if you need help or training.   Targets are always reloaded and full.   Sport shooting has lots of variety.  Plenty of parking and sandwich shop has FRESH food.   Friendly staff.   Only bummer, no golf carts; you need to walk.</review>

Triple b is a great shotgun range with a ton of space for trap and skeet shooting. Great for groups as well as beginners as triple b had instructors available. Great location close to the 60 & 605 fwy.</Review>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Strictly shotguns - - but every form of Shotgun-Sport is offered here.   Some decent instructors too.
I believe that you can rent shotguns from Triple-B.
Such outdoor/expansive facilities are bemcoing rare in So-Calif.   Enjoy this while you can.   Often beginners fire their first firearms in a confined (cinder-block) or concrete building with inadequate ventelation.  They end up next to another guy who rips off 50-rounds of 45-cal or 44mag.  This can traumatize beginners, especially how the concussions bounce off the nearby (hard surfaces.)
Don't underestimate how much more inviting a 20-gauge shotgun is outdoors with expansive fields and nobody messing with a second firearm next to them is.  This facility is almost a 35-year old anacrnism.  Other than electronic target counters, not much different than the 1984 Olympic facility for which much of this place was constructed.   But they do have a lunch grill and knowlegable  employees.  Plus a decent pro shop if you need a choke or vest.   BE PREPARED to take their SAFETY TEST if you're new to these sports.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

So last Sunday the wife and the kids went to a Christmas party.  I elected to stay home and read, immediately got bored and decided to go ahead and try a recently bought shotgun. Saw this place mentioned at Calguns and I am really glad I went there. It is so easy to find, right along Rosemead Blvd next to the 60 freeway. The entrance has a big Triple B sign that is hard to miss.
This place is fantastic for shooting shotguns, the staff are extremely nice and professional. Since it was my first time to shoot clays, I had an instructor named "Candice" to help me. She is wonderful, very detailed and helpful instructions on where to aim and how to hit those flying targets.
Highly recommended.</Text>

The staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and demonstrate through their actions that they have customer service first in mind.  Most revealing about the business, however, are the customers that frequent it.  Stereotypes of shooters as being boorish rednecks are unfair and often untrue, but let's face it:  it's true often enough to warrant the stereotype. Triple B, though, seems to draw in the sportsmen and gentlemen shooters, as well as the families seeking recreation together. In years past, I tried to time my shooting so that I could shoot without being grouped with strangers.  At Triple BBB, however, I actually enjoy it and end up meeting people I would be happy to have as friends.<//review><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

Triple B Clays is an awesome shotgun park. Had an instructor last weekend for the first time Jerry Friedberg very professional and patient for the first time sporting clay shooter, had shot skeet in the desert for many years with a small launcher, there is no comparison to the excitement you will have at a first class shotgun park. I cant say enough about the staff as well, all easy to talk with very friendly and really know their stuff. I'm hooked for life !!!!
Thank you Triple "B"

<Response>{'time': 1468616545620, 'text': 'Neil,\n\nI felt I should respond with an explanation of price.  If you rented everything separate The cost break down follows:\nGun Rental $25, Ear & eye $4.38, Ammo 8.44, targets $14.00 - Instructor $60 per hour  (billed in 1 hour blocks) total cost without discounted package $111.82. Approx 30% discount.  Please let me know if you have additional concerns.  Hope to see you at Triple B in the future.  Safe Shooting, Billie'}<//Response><Rating>4</Rating>< Review>
$70 is a bit pricey (got 25 targets, gun rental, ammo and instructor), but had a good time.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Honestly despite the surrounding area/city of this place. This is such a great place. First of all the women who work there are so kind and patient. They understand the position your in so they work with you. I took my cat Nala here to get dropped off and was super easy. They were clear with instructions and fees. I picked her up a week later, with a beautiful standard urn that they provided, with a clay paw print, and certificate of her cremation. It was all so beautiful. I paid a total of 180$ flat for my 8lb tabby which included the urn and clay. I hate to say it but I don’t plan on being back, but if I ever need to be back because of my pet, I will definitely come back here. This place is wonderful! I just wish I could’ve got to go inside but can’t because of COVID. But don’t be deceived by the area! Trust me, This place is great (:<//Review>< pictures>

My dad and sister took our beloved dog lucky and they said that they were so comforting and the whole process was great. When we went to pick him up the place was very warming and it made you feel in peace. The woman showed us our dogs box, his ashes, a lock of his hair, and foot prints. We love the care they gave to our family member!</text>

However, you ring the doorbell and walk into this amazing little showroom with a wall of beautiful urns.  I was so touched by how nice everything is.  Wonderful place when handling the final services for a beloved pet.</Review>< Time>

I strongly recommend this place. Excellent caring, thoughtful customer service. Gave me a lot of comfort and peace of mind, and some closure... I would definitely go back to them if I ever had another lost and I tell everyone about how beautiful my experience was and how comfortable I felt with you all handling my little girl Mama's.<//review>

I loved this place took my baby when he died and couldn't have asked for a better experience. I couldn't even talk during the paperwork portion but the girl was very understanding and gave me my time. Really appreciate the comfort.<//Review>

The people here are compassionate and make sure your beloved pet gets the best afterlife care. It's very clean and you have a private viewing room for your last moments before cremation. l have been to another cremation place for years but it doesn't compare. The price is very reasonable.

They explained everything to us in a very professional matter which made this process a bit easier. Thank you for everything! I am very very very pleased with your services.

I've taken my two deceased dogs to be cremated, here. They are very helpful, and their viewings are very touching - to see your pet the final time similar to a funeral viewing. I highly recommend Paws.<//Review>

During such a terrible time of grief and loss and heartache, Paws Pet Cremation provided great compassion, empathy, and understanding. They demonstrated great care and kindness, which was very reassuring. Thankfully, there is after-hours service available, making this process of farewell so very helpful.< /text>

Honestly I was blown away by the amazing service  I called after hours  and the girl that took my call was very helpful because (even though my head was all over the place And i called about three times just to ask the same questions over and over again )the girl was very helpful and understanding! The next morning when I took my cat in everyone was nice and helped my family and I go through the process easier for us planning all of the arrangements ! we were able to say our final goodbyes to her in a very respectful and honorable way !

The staff here went above and beyond,you can telling they truly care for you and your pet !</Text>

<review>I took my beloved bearded dragon, Hanna, in for cremation at this location. The workers were incredibly kind and understanding of the pain i was going through after losing my Hanna. They patiently walked me through the steps of cremation and picking out an urn for Hanna. All my questions for the price of the urns, cremation and any additions such as clay paw prints and other accessories were answered in detail and i was assured that my Hanna would be handled with care and would be ready to be picked up two to three days from the day i took her in. After everything was taken cared of and payed for i was given privacy to say goodbye to my dearly beloved Hanna for the very last time.
... i returned a nearly a week later due to scheduling issues and again, i was greeted with warmness and i was given Hanna’s official cremation certificate, the towel i had wrapped her in(they ask if there is anything the animal has that you would like to be returned to you), and her tag. All was given to me in a brown paper bag with a beautiful tag that says her name and Hanna’s urn was given to me in my hand. I nearly cried tears of happiness knowing my Hanna would still be with me and that she was treated kindness within this facility. I highly, highly recommend taking your pets to this location, you and your dear pet(s) will be treated with love and kindess ❤️🐾<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< GmapID>

I am glad my brother referred me at PPC during the most difficult time of my life. I was so devastated that day and had to check out different places. I ended up with PPC. Their packages are excellent and the prices are reasonable. They have viewing, memorial service, & you can witness your pets cremation (unlike the other places I called). To me that's very important to say my last good bye to my baby BOO, to be able to touch and kiss her one more time. Thank you PPC for your compassion for our fur babies.<//Text>

After the difficult decision to put my sweet but very sick cat to sleep, Paws Pet was amazing in their service and compassion.  They picked up Dixie from my vet within 24 hours, and she was ready to be picked up in less than a week.  Their signature package included an individual cremation and certificate, a lovely wooden box for her ashes and tuft of fur, and 3 sets of paw prints, one of which was encased in a personalized frame with her name.  I also found in my bag 2 handwritten sympathy cards.  Their facility is beautiful on the inside, and I believe they treated Dixie with respect and dignity.  When the time comes for my other two cats, I will definitely be using their services.<//text>

Very professional and open to the public. They offer additional services and viewing for your family for final goodbyes. They make sure your pet has an individual cremation. When I received my urn they gave us a card for our loss. They definitely care and stands out from other places. Don't judge the area the business is located.</text>

We lost our beloved pet Brownie tonight after a diagnose with cancer (leukimia) that left us broken. It was after hours almost and Sierra picked up the phone, was extremely nice and understanding and was willing to wait for my grieving mother to drive 30 minutes to get there. We miss her dearly already but I had a good feeling about this place ! Thank you Sierra for being there tonight and taking us in!<//Text>

When Pet Paw Cremation answered the man I spoke with after hours was so kind, compassionate and informative. They actually all are!!!! I can't Thank All Of You Enough!!! The Wonderful Young Lady who picked up Gizmo is so Professional, Respectful and Compassionate.🙏🏼  Today we went to pick up Our Little Furbaby Gizmo and The Wonderful Young Lady that picked up Gizmo at our home was there to help us once again. The place is Beautiful and Peaceful and the way Our Baby Gizmo was given to us with Such Beautiful, Personal Presentation🙏🏼Our Hearts are Broken but you all Helped us through such a Tragic Time. We Are Truly Thankful For The Amazing Way everything was Handled🙏🏼  Our Little Furbaby Gizmo is back Home with us🙏🏼😓 God Bless You All!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼< /text>< rate>

<Text>Losing a family member is always painful and a time of haze and confusion. Thanks to the nice people at Paws Pet Cremation, the process was made a lot smoother and tolerable from the time we step into their premises. They make every effort to be sensitive to the emotions one is dealing with and keep the paperwork and the questions to a bare minimum, which was deeply appreciated at such a traumatic time.

We highly recommend to come through at that painful, sad moment of losing our furry friends who bring us nothing but love and comfort throughout their lifetime.

They deserve to be honored and treated with dignity in life and in death, and that is exactly what you will find in this place. Thank you for taking care of our beloved kitty Pepe.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Onelia, Julia, Pam and myself brought our beloved Elvis here last Saturday, January 28, 2017. The patience and compassion Ryan extended to us is greatly appreciated. We didn't feel rushed during the entire process including the viewing. Thank you Ryan. We highly recommend this place.<//Text>

Best place for care of your pet during this difficult time. Unlike other services, you're guaranteed your pet's ashes are your pet's ashes. The place you can trust. Wish they offered more keepsakes for sale.</review>

<text>I can not stop talking about you guys and how an awesome experience it was since the moment you came to pick up our beautiful Belle.
I cant believe the customer service that was given during this hard time.
I love how my family received Belle's urn with such presentation and love.
And the after math... we received a letter regarding their sympathy ... this just broke my heart of how much detail was put into this type of Service.
The Staff that dealt with us : Liz ( who received our call), Pick up driver (sorry I don't remember her name but she was super nice), and Rebecca (who turned in our Belle's Cremated Remains ) simply High Class service.

Belle was our family dog for 12 years we loved her very much. we miss her but we have her in our hearts.

Thank you once again.. I talk about you guys all the time. :)< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

Paws Pet Cremation is a great place. I called them the night my cat Aimee passed away. I was wreck, making no sense, and their staff was very patient and respectful of my situation. I brought her in the next morning and had her back by 4 pm, with the Priorty Cremation. Paws is wonderful. They made things a little easier for me during a very sad time.< /text>

I just wanted to write a review for Paws Pet Cremation from a employee standpoint. I am a newer hire and I love going to work each day feeling like I am making a difference. The owners definitely built a strong company with solid values. The only con is the drive to and from work during rush hour.</Review>

Yosune and Alan were the best!!! I could not have asked for more when my cat, Ricky, passed.... Our immense grief was certainly made easier by the great warmth, sympathy, patience and customer service from the time we brought in the body to the time the cremated remains was returned to us. The selection of urns is quite impressive. It is representative of every taste and budget. The facility is also very clean, very warm and truly welcoming. There is also a viewing room where you can even say your final goodbye. I am truly impressed and would always highly recommend them to anyone who will be going through this most difficult experience of losing a beloved part of the family...

I never thought any aspect of losing Abby, my british-shorthair baby could be positive, but Paws people were so compassionate and tender, right down to the beautiful presentation of her cremains and the sweet condolence card I received. I highly, highly recommend Paws Pet Cremation.</Review>

<review>We spent over $1500 for cremation services at this location for our dogs. We purchased a total of six urns all of the urns came with stands  except one. When I called PAWS to inform them we were missing a stand I was told they would ship one to us for a $15 charge. The stand is literally two small pieces of wood joined together and is approximately 3 inches high.  Sadly if we don’t have the stand the urn lays flat.     My suggestion: make sure when you pick up your urns you have your stands.   With that said they get one star for customer service.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Dr Q and the team are always great.  They are always friendly and really get involved with making sure that you get the new glasses you love.
2 weeks ago my currently glasses broke :(. I stopped in and they fixed then for me… not perfect because the ear thing was broken, but they pirates one from an old pair of glasses and made mine (although different colors!) functional.  And for free!  Now I’ve had my eyes checks and my new, beautiful glasses are on the way!< /Text>

<text>Dr. Quenzer and her team are absolutely amazing! All staff, from the front desk, to pre testing, to Erica the optician are all super friendly and professional. Dr. Quenzer is the best optometrist I’ve ever been to. She is knowledgeable, friendly and everything was explained every step of the way during my visit. The office is in a great location, is very clean and decorated so cute! The experience is definitely above and beyond. I highly recommend Eye Q optometry to anyone looking for a fabulous place to take care of their eyes and vision.<//text>< name>

My husband and I had a very good experience at Eye-Q Optometry. The staff is professional and welcoming. The office has high tech equipment juxtaposed with colorful, interesting art which created a fun and easy environment. Dr. Melody is super smart and down to earth and made us both feel very comfortable and taken care of. It all added up to a pleasant Doctor visit.

We would highly recommend!</review>

The staff at Eye Q are absolutely amazing. My family has optometry services covered through Kaiser, but we pay out of pocket for VSP insurance solely so we can go to Eye Q. They are attentive, caring, and devoted to their patients. They go above and beyond for us every single time. Thank you Eye Q!<//Text>

<review>I've been seeing Dr. Q for going on 2 years and I still look forward to my appointments with her. Everyone in the office makes me feel welcome and at home. (I almost took my shoes off so I could kick back) Dr. Quenzer can do everything an opthomologist can do except surgery. I have high pressure in both eyes and she has it well under control and has assured me that I don't have glaucoma.
Her office is always so clean and comfortable and I love the individual service from everyone  and everyone is very good at their job. I cant wait to get my new glasses! SO CUTE! And a great price!</review></record>

The folks at Eye-Q are great!  They are friendly and professional.
Dr. Quenzer picked up on an eye problem that I didn't even know that I had.  Her information allowed me to get the help I needed to prevent much bigger problems later on.  I like these guys!</review>

<Text>I had an emergency eye need, and after calling various recommended optometrists, Eye-Q was the one willing to work to get me in sooner rather than later so I could see. The employees were very friendly and the Dr was certainly knowledgeable. The location is kept very clean, and glasses presentation is certainly an added aesthetic.
Thank you for getting me in so quickly and dealing with my issue in a quick, professional, and positive manner. I would definitely recommend this place and go back myself.</Text><response>None</response><Time>1594064078230< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><userid>116133480442273380757< /userid><GmapID>0x809b3d16c8b84287:0xbf306c3b3700610a</GmapID><username>Marie Putnam< /username><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I’ve gone here for years, but this last appointment really stood out, they are asking everyone to wear masks as well as wash hand which is super cool, I was over 20 minutes late for my appointment and was honestly expecting to be sent home, but they fit me in and we’re super nice about it the whole time, even though it was 100% my fault! Thank you for such amazing service!< /text>

Fabulous doctor who cares about her patients.  Her staff is also wonderful and everyone clearly enjoys helping people get their vision to the best it can be.

Picking out glasses is always fun and the staff is great at that too.< /Review>

My wife and I have been with Melody since she opened her practice in 2008. She and her staff have always been top notch and we have always been given excellent service. She really cares about her patients and is very thorough. Can't say enough good things about Eye-Q Optometry. Highly recommend her.<//text>

<text>I am very impressed with Dr. Quenzer and her staff. The Dr. observed a broken blood vessel in my left eye and referred me to a retina  specialist. My exam was very thorough and in my opinion very professional.

The staff there treated me like I was a long time patient. They were very nice and knew exactly what needed to be done.
Dr. Q explained in very understandable terms exactly what she was doing and what I could expect with my follow up treatment. She took her time with me and I never felt she wanted to get on to the next patient.
I appreciated her willingness to answer all my questions and never making me feel rushed.

The selection of eye glasses is great. They have something for everyone.
I can only give Dr. Q the highest rating and would recommend her to anyone needing an eye exam and/or glasses.< /text>< pictures>

Dr. Q is the best! I go to her for all of my family's eye needs. She's helped us many times and has even offered to work with my mother who has advanced Alzheimers, and isn't always the easiest patient by far. Everyone else who works here is great too! Love all the smiles every time.</Review>

< Review>
I rated 4/5 and had a very good visit.

Pros - Nice environment with with a friendly staff. The office has a corky theme that dosent take itself too seriously. The staff and office were nice and very good with the kids. I never felt rushed, pressured or like "Just another patient".

Cons - The proccess was abit slow and some of the questions were abit personal. I felt like the staff was abit relaxed and the process was different than usual. I wasnt quite aware of some of the add-ons unitl I asked (Lenses) and my daughter loved kid frames but the size was wrong.

Summary - 5 stars would be VERY hard for me to give anyone. This place faced some obstacles with my visit but adapted at every turn. Even when my daughters frames didnt fit they dug into a shipment they just recieved. The lens person was very knowledgeable about any questions asked and even demonstrated differences. The eye doctor was equally knowledgeable and made the visit feel personally taylored to me. Thank you guys for finding a way to make my flex delay work and the outstanding visit.

Edit*
We were contacted Thursday or so. After paying a little over 1200.00 on monday I thought my glasses were in. I called nack Saturday only to be told that due to a misunderstanding my glasses were just being proccessed on Saturday. So even though the office got their money and messed up my 10 day wait started 6 days later.

No mention of anything to compensate or make things right. Appreantly once they have your money any burdens thereafter are all yours.

DISAPPOINTING.</Review>

Our dog came back from boarding here with many bite marks up and down his back and on the side of his neck! The staff had no pulse on the situation, was not able to give us anymore information as to why this happened. All said and done, they were not able to effectively keep our sweet dog safe during his stay. Really disappointed with the quality of care at this facility, and will not be back.</text>

My dog and I love this place!  When I went on vacation, I brought my pup here and she had a good time.  I loved that they sent report cards with pictures of her each day.  I also really appreciate that they let me bring her special blanket and a toy from home.  Other places in the area do not allow that.  Everyone that I dealt with that worked there was very nice, and made me feel safe leaving my baby there.  I highly recommend THPR for boarding and daycare!<//Text>

Thousand Hills took such great care of my two cats! It was my first time boarding them and I was nervous about it, but the staff at Thousand Hills updated me with pictures and a "report card" (I've attached an image sent over by them during their stay) and was very accommodating when I wanted to check in over the phone during their week-long stay. The staff was attentive and my cats really enjoyed themselves. The staff even notified me after check out when they realized I had left a toy I had brought for my cats behind, and they held it for me for a month until I could pick it up since I had just moved out of town. Also very very affordable and great for last minute boarding! In summary, Thousand Hills has an amazing staff and I couldn't be happier with my experience boarding. Thank you!< /text>

<Text>This place is amazing for our two yellow labs Cali & Luke.
Luke is a rescue and sometimes we are nervous that he will have too much anxiety, thousand hills was so patient with him and now he is so much more comfortable at drop off.
My husband and I live in our RV full time but we both work.
We drop off our dogs twice a week for full day doggie daycare. They take care of the dogs so well, and they are so tired when they come home.
tired dog= happy dog.
So happy we can trust an amazing place with our furry children.
(and we love the daily "report cards" complete with pictures)
Thanks Again!< /Text>< Pictures>

I'd at least get a call back...... even if it was to be told they had no availability. I just would have appreciated something after several attempts to contact them.< /Review>< Resp>

<Review>This is the place to take your dog for boarding!! The staff is very friendly and great with the dogs!! They give you a report card on your pet to tell you how they are doing along with a photo!! My dog loves the suite accommodations. Lots of play time for the dogs. You can even schedule to have a treat of a frozen kong with peanut butter for your dog. I highly recommend this place for pet boarding.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
I've been bringing my girl here for over 18 months. She loves it and the staff loves her. This is daycare and the dogs are not under a microscope all day which is fine by me. The staff does their best to stay on top of everything and make sure your dog is in the right yard based on their energy and demeanor throughout the day.< /Review>

<review>I have been bringing my dog here for over 2 years. I was very concerned taking my dog there after hearing about the fire that unfortunately killed 7 dogs. The staff were deeply affected by this disaster and the boarding facility provided counseling services on site for their staff and the pet owners who lost their pets. Thousand Hills has since done many renovations to ensure something like this doesn't happen again. They have installed floor heating in the dog houses that is MUCH safer. The staff here are EXCELLENT. I bring my timid dog there whenever we leave town and he is always excited to go there. Over time has warmed up to several staff members. They are always willing to accommodate his needs. I am so glad I decided to start coming here!</review>< userid>

< Review>
Chinita was rescued from the streets of Punta Arenas, Chile.  Since coming to Thousand Hills, her confidence and character has increased tremendously.  She sits at the door of my car in the garage now early in the morning.  This is how I know she wants to go play at Thousand Hills.  I'm happy because I know she's getting the socialization skills and that extra bit of energy worn out of her everyday she's there.  As a result, I find her mentally, physically and emotionally more balance.  I highly recommend and prefer Thousand Hills.  The yards aren't cramped or over crowded and these dogs have room to run and play with each other.   Thank you, Thousand Hills for making a huge difference in my dog.  I see the difference!<//Review>

We've been leaving our dachshund Sam at Thousand Hills Pet Resort for years.  I can tell you all about the staff and facility, but the best way for you to learn is to simply go check out the facility yourself.

The staff of Thousand Hills Pet Resort are wonderful.  You will have a hard time finding people more caring about animals and dedicated to their jobs.  My dog loves it here.  He is so happy to see the staff when we drop him off.  He plays off leash with the other “mini” dogs all day long (they segregate the dogs by size and also by temperament).  Most of the staff recognize my dog by my car, even workers that I would swear I’ve never met before.  They all greet him with excitement and treat him as if he was their own dog (and I’ve observed this same behavior for all the dogs).

The play areas are great.  There is an open grassy area that they use for training (you can enroll your dog and they’ll do some rudimentary training while he’s in daycare or boarding).  The fenced in areas where they spend most of their time (both boarding and daycare) are treated to eliminate fleas and ticks.  In the three years my dog has been going to Thousand Hills, he has never picked up fleas or a single tick.

The staff are very friendly with the humans, too.  I know most of them by name and they know me and my wife on sight.  They keep a computer record of all your telephone numbers and any medical history.  If your dog requires any medication and is staying overnight, it will be in their computer, on their checklists, and they’ll take care of it.  If any issues arise, they'll call you.  They’ll also notify you of any problems (such as your dog being anti-social in some way).

Best of all, there is ALWAYS someone from staff on site.  If you get nervous and want someone to check on your dog, all you have to do is call.< /Text>

< Review>
We have 3 larger dogs (2 huskies and a Shepard mix) and have never had to board them/doggy day care them before. We were a bit worried when we found out we needed to while we put new floors in our house.  After a little research, we wanted to try this place out since they had cute cottages that all 3 dogs could stay in together.  Thousand HIlls was sooooo overly awesome and we are sooo happy we took our dogs there and will do so again!!  We started with trying out the doggy day care for a few days. Our dogs came home super tired but happy and every time we drove up to Thousand Hills, they got so excited I thought they were going to jump out of the windows to get there.  We just had them boarded there for a few nights and the staff couldn't be any nicer! We emailed a few times while our dogs were there to check on them and they responded very quickly.   It seems like the staff really enjoys their jobs!  Love that they give your dog "report cards" and will do a free day at day care so they can see what yard is best for your dog. Thanks guys. Hope to send our pups again soon!</Review>

THPR is the only place we trust with our 13 yr old Yellow Lab.  They care for him as if he was their own. Last year, while on an extended trip, he developed pneumonia.  The staff took him to the Vet, waited while X-rays were done, picked up his meds and nursed him back to health by the time we returned.  Each day, they send out a report card on how your dog is doing.  The staff have always been friendly and if I call to see how our boy is doing they will check on him right away.  We wouldn’t trust anyone else like we do THPR.<//text>

NOT happy!  Last time my dog came home smelling so bad of the cleaning solution that I had to immediately give her a bath.  THIS time she was covered in mud and they left her that way.  Her bedding was soooo dirty!!  And I had scheduled a bath for her before I picked her up and she still was smelly and her fur was dirty.  NO WAY she got a bath, maybe a rinse.<//Text>

They will not allow us to pick up our dog after 6 (we hit traffic and will be slightly later) even though there are people on site.  They don’t have office staff there so they can’t check her out they tell me.  The lack of flexibility, need to pay for another day, and inability to see my dog after being away for 3 days is frustrating and disappointing.  I won’t be using them again if I don’t need to.< /Review>

< Review>
My dog came back with scrapes and bruises and wouldn't eat for several days after a day at doggie daycare. We tried a couple more days after telling the staff about it, and they said they tried to keep him from playing so much, and separated him when he seemed tired. I appreciate their efforts, but the results were the same.  I do not think there was good supervision of the dogs (at least large dog area). My dog is the friendliest, happy go lucky dog and he would be visibly shaking with fear when I dropped him off. To that note, the staff was apologetic, and gave us a refund when we decided on another doggie daycare, but I give it one star because of how bad of an experience my dog had. That was in 2014, so it may have changed since then.</Review>

11/19/12 There was a fire in their boarding facilities that burnt 3 dog houses and killed 7 dogs. Reported cause is most likely an electrical issue. PLEASE research before leaving your pet there.

Also, My dog was there for about a week (last December) and came with scratches on her belly. She loves playing with other dogs and gets very excited so it may of been partially her fault; however, it would appear that the dogs are not watched as carefully as they should be.

Also, she is up to date on her shots and caught Giardia here "Dogs become infected when they swallow Giardia that may be present in water or other substances that have been soiled with feces". Perhaps the water or kennel are not as clean as it should be.

Overall, I would not go back.</Text>

<Text>We left our two labs at Thousand Hills Pet Resort for 4 days. When we returned, one of our dogs, Gracie, was extremely swollen, covered head to toe in welts, and was having trouble breathing. P.J., one of the staff members, who told me he was checking up on my girls through out the weekend and brought her to my car told me that Gracie looked normal. I was told by the manager on duty, Tenisha, that "stuff like this happens, and there is not anything they can do about it." !!!!! I was livid. I asked them how they would be paying for my emergency vet bill on a sunday because she obviously needed to go to the vet. They told me they would not being paying for any medical attention because of their "policy." The ER vet told us that she had been stung or bit by something she was allergic to (which I realize is not the kennels fault) but because of the amount of swelling and stretched skin and welts she had been like this for days!! Which means, they neglected my dogs for days and neglected them enough for them to think that swollen, puffy, and bumpy is "normal." I called the manager, Kyle, the next day, and he told me that he spoke with P.J. and P.J. had handled everything by the book also telling me that while my dog was in P.J.s care, he "never had time to notice she was sick" depite both P.J. and Kyle telling me that he was the one that was checking up on both of my dogs throughout the weekend. We argued for a while about getting reimbursed for my stay and for him paying for my vet bill....he refused. It was not until he told me that Bailey was healthy and Bailey was not sick when P.J. checked on her that I absolutely realized that even the manager is neglectful. When I told him he was arguing about the wrong dog and he didn't even know what dog was sick that was in his care!!! (because Gracie was sick, NOT Bailey.) Only then did he reimburse me for my stay. They still refuse to pay my $185 vet bill because of their "policy." And should Kyle have anything to say about me lying about this as he did on a previous post, I dare him to call me on it. Unless they have burned their paperwork, Thousand Hills should have all of this on file, my vet will back me up, as well as the Better Business Bureau which I have contacted. I would never lie about my dogs. THIS KENNEL DOES NOT CARE FOR YOUR PETS. And I have talked to many other kennels and vets...all of whom have not had good things to say about this kennel.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Everyone I worked with during the process was very professional and friendly. Everyone arrived on time and did the work as requested. This business is very easy to get in contact with and that is a big deal to me when spending this amount of money on something. My system works great and came with a very good warranty.</review>< Name>

Please read:

I am a perfectionist….  Retired Navy Fighter Pilot and Engineer.  So when I say 10 stars on a 5 star rating, you can take it to the bank.

I watched them a lot and they did everything I wanted done without me saying a word…  they went way beyond and did things I had not expected.

It was 98 degrees outside and over 130+ in the attic.

So good we tipped all of the workers.  One of the first times I have ever done that.

Have and will recommend them to everyone and anyone.</Text>

Alex was awesome!  He answered his phones at 6:00pm.  He came out here and fixed my heater and charged me 1/10th of what I got quoted from a major San Diego company.  He didn’t try to take advantage of me.  I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!!!!</Text>

After an absurdly high quote to repair our air handler by a vendor that we were required to use by First American Home Warranty, and a couple of other high quotes from alternate vendors I independently solicited, Alex of Airmaxx showed up and saved the day. Rather than gouge me on price and convince me I needed to spend >$4K on an a new AC system,  Alex was able to quickly and easily diagnose the problem and resolve it in-house within one hour. It was refreshing to work with someone with ethical standards and a moral compass; and quite the relief to confirm that there was never a need for an entire system replacement. His honesty is appreciated and, although we do not look forward to issues with our AC, we  look forward to working with Alex again if ever necessary.< /Review>

<time>1589653423999</time><rating>5<//rating><text>After weeks of research and contacting several HVAC companies for a quote regarding furnace replacement and adding an AC unit, I decided to have Airmaxx do the project for me. I can say with absolute certainty that I made the right decision. The Project Manager, Yuri, came out to do the estimate and made sure everything was explained fully to my satisfaction.  He was very professional and wasn't pushy at all. Just stayed on the sideline and gave me time to compare to help me make an informed decision. The Installers - Victor, Yuri, and David, did a fantastic job. Very hardworking group of people, couldn't have asked for a better install team. Their quality workmanship is evident throughout. Let's not forget the office staff, Lissa and Ivy, who made sure that the post install document/paperwork/notification were ready and sent/relayed to me in a timely fashion. Both were equally outstanding as well. Thanks everyone for a job very well done. I will surely recommend Airmaxx to friends and family for their heating and cooling needs.

A very satisfied customer,

Art is amazing! I have had him help me on 2 of my homes over the years getting a/c replaced or fixed. He knows his stuff! Knowledgeable, prompt, simply does the right thing the way it should be done. I have referred him to at least a dozen people that all have the exact same thing to say about him!<//Review>

< Review>
I called Air Maxx for my rental when the tenant said air was blowing but it was not cold. The technician (Sam K.) came out right away. He was very polite, respectful and honest. It was a minor problem, a disconnect in an electrical wire. He fixed it for 50 bucks. I COULD NOT believe it! I was so worried that it would be a very costly repair. I, honestly, wouldn't have known the difference if he said it was a lot more. I have been burned before so I try to go with very reputable companies but they can also be very expensive. I am so pleased to find a company that is both reputable and has fair prices. I have several rentals and have added them to my contact list and will certainly use them again if I need to!</Review>

<text>The blower on our AC unit stopped.  I was referred by our neighbor to Airmaxx.  I was pretty sure they were going to recommend replacing our 20 year old AC/heater unit.  But the tech came and he immediately went to the blower in the attic and found out it was a bad circuit board.  Had a new one in his truck and everything was down in 15 minutes for a fraction of what I expected to pay.  Honest and professional!  Definitely recommend!<//text>< user>

We were very pleased that this air-conditioning service was recommended to us. We have a rental property, a condominium, and this poses challenges sometimes when services need to be done. Trying to coordinate a service company with the availability of the renters, and then also coordinating with the condominium property management can be a chore. Airmaxx x was very flexible, and our renters commented how nice, helpful And professional they were. They worked with us to see whether there was any way to repair the existing air conditioner, despite being so old that manufacturer of parts were unavailable. After giving it many tries we finally decided that we needed to replace the air conditioner which was done efficiently and at a lower price point than I had imagined! We, and our our renters are both pleased with the outcome and the effort that Airmax spent on this job.</Text>

<time>1598223285785< /time><rate>4<//rate><Review>Had a new heating and AC system installed, along with new ducts in the attic, before the summer.  Now that we've had some real heat, I can confidently state that the system is working as expected.
Our salesman was Gene Fikhman.  He was exactly the type of salesperson whom I like to work with:  informative, very responsive when I had questions, but never pushy, never tried to up-sell, didn't bad-mouth the competition.  He really represented the company well by giving me straight talk and letting me make my own decisions about what I wanted.
Installation was fast.  A team of four removed my old furnace, put in all the new furnace and air conditioner components, and replaced all the ducting in the attic in one day.  All the equipment looks to be installed neat and professional.
The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5, is they made a mistake in the ductwork, causing one of the bedrooms to not get any air.  Once I called and reported it, they came out and fixed it, but I would rather it have been right the first time.  No matter who you go with, be sure that everything works to your satisfaction.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80d9581f287f6be5:0xc809f65e898cc49< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Gene and the entire team at Airmaxx did a great job!!  They were informative, on-time, fast, efficient, and cleaned up after themselves.  On top of all that..., their price was significantly better than their competitors.  I can’t recommend them highly enough!!  If you need new AC/Heat or any HVAC services - Airmaxx is the company to call!< /Text>< date>

Edgar was very professional while trying to diagnose an issue that didn't end up being related to our AC system. We needed an AC tune up anyway and he provided an excellent explanation of how the system works while working on it. He was honest and straightforward.< /review>

<review>We love working with Airmaxx. They do great work, put us as customers first and we got the system back up and running. They could have probably sold us a new system a few times over the years but they haven't because what we have is good quality and still works. We appreciate the relationship and would not go to any other provider for these services.< /review><GmapID>0x80d9581f287f6be5:0xc809f65e898cc49</GmapID><user_id>114083593620308350272<//user_id>< Date>

<Text>Our 25+ year HVAC died out last month. 5-7 companies came and gave me different quote and ideas. Airmaxx (Alex) stopped by promptly, carefully evaluated my outside condenser, furnace and thermostat connection. He briefed options and the deals they carry currently. He helped us chose the best option in terms of tonnage for our house. He also temporarily fixed our old system and replaced our thermostat free of cost (even before us signing the proposal).  Alex team even planned installation a week before the original commit date, did a professional installation. After 2 weeks, they had their quality test person to come and do HVAC leak and efficiency test. Overall we are very happy with their professionalism, quality of service, Customer support and ethical value.
We will happily recommend them!</Text><userid>110451503894923121319<//userid></record>

I called Airmaxx when one of our furnaces ceased working.  The gentleman came the next morning, promptly diagnosed a malfunctioning gas valve, replaced it right away, and observed the system long enough to determine that a blockage in one of the ducts had caused the temperature to rise and the valve to fail.  He saw to that repair, and all was well.  The cost was quite reasonable, and he did not overcharge because of our address.

It turned out that someone working in the attic in the past stepped on and cracked the inside of the duct, and did not tell us.  This caused restricted the air flow and the cascade of events that led to failure of the gas valve.

Our system is 20 years old, and he explained the benefits and costs of maintaining vs. replacing furnaces.  All was done very professionally, without pressure, and I intend to engage Airmaxx to replace all 4 furnaces when the time is right.</Text>

The service we received from AirMaxx was outstanding! Meeting Alex for the estimate, he was professional and patient and explained the installation leaving nothing out, so no surprises! The crew that came were professional and did an excellent job.
I will highly recommend AirMaxx just as he was referred to me! Very Very Happy Customer !< /review>

Had a previously installed heating unit moved from the floor and turned horizontal to be placed in the ceiling. They did a fantastic job! Arrived when they said they would and did the job in an efficient manner.

They were all very nice, easy to work with and understood exactly what we wanted.

Thank you Airmaxx, and beautiful job!!

We had a problem with our carrier air conditioning unit not turning on.  AirMaxx technician came to check it out and quickly discovered that it was caused by a loose breaker switch in the breaker box powering the unit.  He was able to secure the switch will allowed the air conditioner to power up again.  The price for the visit was quite reasonable.</text>

<review>So happy with my Airmaxx experience. I purchased a new AC and furnace about a year ago. Their pricing was the best and sales and install team were all friendly and efficient. AC has been running great. What I'm most impressed with today was the back end support. We had a clogged moisture drain which was causing the AC to shut off periodically. We were just outside the installation  warranty period however they were available same day, quickly identified the issue and fixed without charge. Again, very personable technician who gave me some tips on which filters to use and frequency of replacement (different that what I had researched and expected). Big thank you!!!</review>< Pictures>

We would like to share our experience with the Airmaxx team.

We decided to have our 15-year-old HVAC system replaced due to having some issues. After some research and conversations with HVAC companies, we choose Airmaxx to install a new Carrier HVAC system. Gene was our main contact from Airmaxx. He took care of providing the estimate and scheduling the installation date. In addition, Gene was also present on the day of the installation to talk with his crew and to make sure the new HVAC equipment was delivered to start the job.

Gene, Slava and Vadim came to install the new Carrier HVAC system. They did an awesome job that included making everything they installed, from the Carrier Condenser on the outside of the house, to the Carrier Furnace in the garage, which resulted in a nice clean and organized look after the installation was completed. They were also very conscientious in following COVID-19 guidelines to ensure our safety as well as their own.

I have to say, it was extremely easy to work with Gene from our first contact thru the installation of our new Carrier HVAC system. Anytime I called or texted Gene with questions, he always responded in a timely manner. Gene made everything so easy and effortless.

We want to say thank you to, Gene, Slava, Vadim, Lissa, and Ivy for providing us with awesome customer service!!! The Airmaxx team will be our “go to” HVAC team.</text>

Replaced two 20 year old furnaces and air conditioning units a few months ago to get a more efficient and quiet (furnace) system.  Gene was very straight forward and did a needs analysis to get us the right system.  They also took the time to educate me on code and some of the things their competitors did not even bother to discuss.  Pricing was fair and no surprises.  Had a great experience and would use them again.<//Review>

Extremely happy with Airmaxx Heating and Air Conditioning.  I recently  had a new HVAC system installed.  The installers were professional, clean, polite and did a beautiful job.  Even the County Inspector mentioned what  a excellent job they did.  The sales rep. was extremely knowledgeable and was very helpful in helping me chose the right unit for my home and the perfect location.  Plus, the price was very competitive.   I would highly recommend using this Airmaxx company.        Judy Irwin,   Very satisfied customer!!< /Review>

Replaced our 30+ year old hvac with a new one from Airmaxx. We got  5 different quotes and they had the lowest price plus the best quality system (17.5 seer while all others were 14/16 seer). Sounded too good to be true, but the reviews online about them gave us confidence to choose them. I am glad we did as our new system is humming.

Pros:
1. Value - lowest price for a top notch system - furnace, A/C, and air purifier with a NEST thermostat too.
2. Carrier brand - our old system was Day and Night, which lasted over 30+ years so I wanted to go with the same brand/company.
3. Fast - Got the quote on Friday, and they installed the hvac on Monday.
4. Responsiveness - Edgar always responded very quickly to my emails. I prefer to talk over email so I have a paper trail.

Cons:
1. Both initial inspections failed. The duct inspection and city inspection both initially failed. Had to contact Airmaxx to have them come resolve the issue. Both issues were resolved at no cost so credit to Airmaxx for fixing it so quickly. Both inspections passed the 2nd time around, but obviously you wish the inspections would pass on first attempt.
2. Wish the workers wore shoe socks in the house.
3. I did notice my thermostat's fan function didn't work and it was because it needed an extra wire from the furnace to work. It did cost me a little extra to install because it required running  a wire through my cramped attic. I think the cost to install it was fair, but I wish it was discovered on the initial installation/estimate.

Overall, Airmaxx offered tremendous value compared to the other hvac installers so I'm very happy with my decision.<//review>

My  30-year old Rheem A/C stopped cooling during the high heat this summer. Saw the good reviews for Airmaxx and gave them a call. I was quite impressed that they were able to respond within a day, notified me before arriving and came on time. Edgar diagnosed the problem very quickly and took the time to explain the repairs. He replaced a burnt-out wire, failing capacitor and topped-off the coolant. In addition, he popped-up into my attic and replaced a very dirty air filter. The system immediately began working well and fortunately I did not need a new compressor or expensive new system. Importantly, Edgar was straight forward and honest and did not try to "up-sell" me on equipment that would have been unnecessary.

Based on this good experience, I also had him service another home that needed only a new capacitor. Although it was on short notice, he made time for the repair early the very next morning and we were very satisfied.

Thank you for being so responsive and doing good work for us Edgar and Airmaxx!< /review>

So nice I used them twice. Best price, warranty(never needed to call in five years at last home install ), and the installers were efficient, courteous, and most professional. You can get other estimates but you’ll be glad you picked Airmaxx. Ask for Art.<//text>

Alex the sales person was very professional, arrived on time for the estimate, quickly provided the quote and then scheduled the AC install within a week.

The installation crew arrived on time, with all needed parts, worked hard to get the system up and running, tested it, reviewed it with me and then cleaned up and left. They quoted 1/2 a day and finished in about 4 hours.

Alex followed up often to address questions and check in along the way. What great customer service!

I would highly recommend AirMaxx!</Text>

Great company with great customer service. We met with several other representatives from other companies to replace our A/C/Heating system and this company was the most honest, fair and reasonable company to work with. We worked with Vlad who was very accommodating and went out of his way to answer our questions, show us how to use our new system and worked with us to get the best deal for our system. He matched and beat other companies pricing and still gave us a top notch system.  They were efficient, knowledgeable about all of the options out there and they have a great maintenance program. They also offer great financing. I highly recommend hiring this company over others - we did our homework and there is a reason why they have outstanding reviews. Top Notch!< /Text>

<review>We contacted Airmaxx in May 2019 to replace the undersized central AC system in our home.
They assessed our needs.
For us, we wanted a quieter unit, is is right outside a bedroom, and dehumidification.
The equipment specification they chose was perfect for us. The house is 15 to 20 percent less humid than before, the unit is quiet and does not run all day to maintain cooler temperatures like the old compressor.

We had some hot weather since they did the job and it works great.

Contact Airmaxx, you will be happy you did.</review>< time>

<name>Beard Property Management Aaron Beard</name><review>AirMaxx was fortunately the third of three people I had come out to look at my air conditioner. The first two guys unequivocally said I should just replace my twelve-year-old unit for all sorts of curious reasons (to the tune of between $3,000 & $5,000 respectively). Vlad charged me $285 bucks and had the thing running within 15 minutes. He ran through all the reasons why the person who put my system in did a fantastic job and how I should expect another 15 years of solid service without any major issues. He even spotted a ventilation issue with my heater while he was checking the rest of the system...and fixed it for free! Faith in humanity restored!!!</review>< Rating>

<Review>Owner is very responsive and great to work with. Had an issue with my A/C after they fixed it and he came same day and fixed it free of charge. Takes ownership of his work. Prior was working with a company who seemed to overcharge. His prices seem reasonable, definitely doesn’t try to oversell and make you fix things you don’t need fixed. Will continue to work with Airmaxx.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Had a service scheduled today to get AC checked, wasn’t working at all since last summer!  AirMaxx scheduled me on short notice and worked around my schedule.  Perfect!   Gene was our tech who showed up after taking calls all day on the hottest day of the year here in San Diego!  He was fair, polite, and took the time to explain everything!  I’m a contractor and I know the reputation but Gene and AirMaxx were great!  No sales pitch, just honest!  I don’t normally take the time to review but when you are treated as well as we were today, you gotta share it!   Call them, you will be happy you did!!!!<//text>

Airmaxx is fabulous!!

When I called, the woman was super-friendly and helpful. Got us in the next morning. And our technician Alex was great too! Super professional, punctual, quick and even vacuumed after himself! We're new to SD and he even suggested some places to go. What a overall friendly, nice guy :)

He helped my parents install a more user-friendly thermostat then the one we had. Super affordable. We'll definitely be calling them for any of our AC/heating needs!

Quick Tip: Instead of buying the Yelp deal, tell him and he'll give you the discount! You get the same savings and it saves the company from paying an extra fee.<//review>

<Review>On Friday afternoon, during this last heat wave, I was looking at $3K - $4K to replace my air conditioner and another big company told me it would a week before they could get it and install it.  Alex the technician technician, diagnosed the issue before opening the condenser.  Then explained and showed me exactly what was wrong. And replaced the part and installed a surge suppressor so our system will last longer and use less electricity.
All for less than $400.

Thank you AirMaxx for sending out such a professional.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I had a very good experience with Airmaxx in the Spring 2019. They were referred to me and I would not hesitate to refer them to a friend. They replaced my old furnace and put in a new furnace and AC unit. I got more than I thought I would for less money than competitors pricing.<//text>

<response>None< /response><name>Chrissy Osborn< /name><review>One of our AC units went out of a long weekend (of course!). AirMaxx was both highly recommended in a neighborhood Facebook group and the only company I could get ahold of. Alex came Monday afternoon, and diagnosed the issue within minutes. He had it fixed almost as quickly, but felt it still wasn't cooling at peak performance. He topped up the refrigerant and suggested there could be a secondary issue, but didn't want to have me get extra work done if it wasn't really an issue. A few days later, the same unit started to perform poorly again. i emailed late on Friday evening, and he was there on Saturday to fix it. He got everything running in tip-top shape again, and also serviced my other AC unit to ensure we didn't have the same issue. Very happy with them. Friendly, efficient, knowledgable, and comprehensive service.</review><Rate>5</Rate><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I am writing for my friends Dennis and Jackie Huls.  I was visiting them this week and the temperatures were unbearable. We called two companies to install an air conditioner and decided to go with Airmaxx after talking with Alex, the manager.  He was very patient about going over all the details.  He took his time and looked at the furnace and the vents in all the rooms.  He gave two different options and fair pricing. My friends asked him if it could be I stalled right away. They came out  the next morning around 8:30 were finished by 12. They encountered a problem with a furnace and took care of the problem without asking for more money. They were quiet, courteous and cleaned up all the areas they worked in.  Alex came back at the end and explained everything in detail and made sure my friends knew that they could call him anytime. I am impressed by their level of efficiency and great customer service. I would recommend them to anyone.</Review>

<Review>My experiences with this company have been nothing short of stellar! I bought my unit with Air Maxx about 5 years ago, unfortunately the unit stopped blowing cold air. They came out the same day, literally a couple hours after I called and replaced the warrantied part to correct the issue. Your customer service was outstanding!

Sincerely,
A very satisfied customer.<//Review>< Pictures>

I went years without A/C in my current home, but with the summers seeming to get hotter every year, I finally gave in to purchase an a/c unit. Airmaxx was recommended to me from a friend who used them for air conditioning repair and I would certainly pass on the same recommendation. Alex came out the next day after I called in, assessed my home and provided a recommendation for the proper size unit. A few days later his install team came out and performed the air conditioning installation. Loving the A/C on hot days and overall I had a great experience!<//review>

AirMaxx is AMAZING!!  We worked with Vlad Turovskiy the whole time.  We had some issues with our general contractor, but Vlad was incredibly accommodating.  We did a major remodel of our house that took over a year.  Vlad was very patient and worked through all of our issues.  We installed a new FAU and 4-ton 21 SEER air conditioning unit, along with all new ducting for a 3,100 sf home.  The system has 2 zones (upstairs and downstairs) with electronic dampers.  Vlad's crew was prompt and efficient.  Even with all of the other building delays (about 18  months), Vlad delivered the system at the original proposal price.  I highly recommend AirMaxx.< /Text>

These guys are the best, having done a professional install yesterday to replace my dilapidated heat pump & AC that was on its last legs. They somehow managed to haul away all the old equipment through a very narrow opening. I wouldn’t have trusted another company. Believe me, I had at least 3 estimates from competitors including Anderson, RightTime, and Home Depot. In at least one case, the competitor had no experience doing installs but was only selling a service. In another case, I signed on for yearly maintenance but they really did very little except to install a Nest thermostat, which Airmaxx fixed the wiring on. These guys don’t give the runaround, they know what they’re doing & they do the job right. Now I have more airflow than I’ve ever had. In addition to the install, they put in new air flow registers, new filter, and brand new beautiful filter cover that’s so much nicer than the one I had. Alex is very responsive. His team arrives ready & working all the time they are on-site. When they recalibrated my Nest thermostat to work with the new system, it was so easy for them. No reconnecting to the network was even necessary. They just did it. When they did the disconnect to the old system in the attic, they knew how to shut off the breakers in order to install the new system. Everything went like clockwork. The guys were very polite, clean & tidy, and put cloths down & wore the appropriate protection. They work as a team, each one of them. My neighbor had recommended them, as did the new tenants & also the ones who had moved out when the install was done for them since they are in the military. My neighbor rents from an absentee landlord who coordinated with them. The HOA didn’t require approval but said I could put the permit on file with them if I wanted for their records. Everything was done right & all in one day. By early afternoon, the job was finished & they were sweeping up. The guys tested the new system & allowed me to do so. Also, part-way through the job, they informed me of the status & that all was going well. Exceedingly high standards & great customer service<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>When my central AC died I called all of the major AC contractors.  None could get to me within a week and a half!  Found AirMaxx on HomeAdvisor, sent them an e-mail around 7 am.  They  called back by 7:30 am., the tech was here by 9 am and the problem was fixed by 9:15 am.  Guess who will be getting all of my business from now on.< /Text>< pictures>

I called Friday morning and Alex Glozman from Airmaxx arrived at noon Saturday. I was amazed! Everyone else was booked out a week + due to the heat wave just subsiding. Alex quickly diagnosed and corrected the problem, and I've been enjoying the cool ever since! Thank you Airmaxx, great job!</review>

<Text>Airmaxx took very good care of us. Our air conditioner broke during a 90 degree week and we had out of town guests. Alex came out the day after I called and diagnosed the problem. Even though it was a weekend, he assured me my unit would be repaired quickly and a crew was here first thing Monday morning. Everything was fixed, Alex and the crew were very professional and my house is cool again! I would definitely recommend Airmaxx!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Incompetent Technician’s came up with a inaccurate  diagnosis, wanted to charge $1500 to clean the radiator core and air filter when there was no need to do that, got someone else to check it, it turns out that the system’s freon level was low, top it and did it free of charge.
For years this was the company to call for my rentals and main residence AC issues. Not anymore<//Text>

For one they replaced my blower motor and not the capacitor which was bad, they used electrical tape instead of wire caps like is supposed to be used. On top of that they failed to found out the system and over charged my A/C unit.
SMH. They should fix thier mess ups and remberse me the money I had to pay to fix thier mess ups</text>

Called AirMaxx Heating and Air Conditioning this morning because my A/C was not blowing out cold air!  First time I have tried it in a while.  It's been HOT here in San Diego!  I called several businesses that were less than friendly and finally got hold of Alex Glozman at AirMaxx.  He was out here in less than 3 hours after a very hot and busy weekend.  He was on top of everything.  FAST  EFFICIENT   FRIENDLY and VERY AFFORDABLE!!  Definitely my new go to person for Air Conditioning.  Also going to have him come out this fall before it starts getting cold to check out my heater.  I feel good knowing I have a GREAT service person for my heating and air.  Now, I wonder if they also do windows?!!!   Thanks Alex!</Text>

I've been waiting and calling for my estimate for more than a week ago and nothing no estimate still. I guess they're waiting for the summer to go away so they can give me my estimate. I'm very dissapointed since my friend refered me to Air Maxx :-(< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Omigoodness!! The sauces are amazingly flavorful and what a variance.   But be prepared they are mostly spicy AF but still delicious.   The different proteins each had a unique,  deep, and wonderfully great flavor.  The meal came with a little grill that took a bit longer to heat thus we transferred our food to a pan and viola done a lot faster.  The proportion of broth to veggies was a bit off but maybe because some spilled in transit.  Otherwise I am sad to wait an entire year for this again.  Completely worth the two hour round-trip drive.  Maybe next time the pickup times could be outside of rush hour.  Thank you for filling our bellies.< /text>< Pics>

Whenever I think about fried rice, Ayara Thai comes to my mind even though I live far far away from this place now. It's been almost 4 years since I have been to this place and the taste of fried rice is the same as what I had years ago.

I am introduced to this wonderful dish called  Drunken Noodles back in 2013 same here in Ayara Thai. When we ordered the same now with Medium spice, the dish lacked the taste, and spice levels were high. We couldn't able to complete the whole dish. When we informed them about the same to the Staff to give inputs, He thought I might be playing the tactic to get additional order(I don't know but the way he spoke, I interpreted that way).< /Text></record></dataset><record>

My favorite Thai restaurant.  Their yellow curry is so good. The potatoes come with  the skin but it's so thin that it is not an issue. Keep in mind that you need to order rice separately, especially if you are ordering to go. Also, the portion for the sushi rice might come as a surprise to.some because it is pretty small. So go for regular rice instead (white or brown).</Review>

You can’t go wrong with the Khao Soi either. One thing I might not recommend is their Pineapple Fried Rice... I’m not a big fan of the tomato paste version of this dish.</Review>< Pics>

The restaurant was very crowded at 8:30pm which is a pretty good sign it’s good.  It was very good.  The panang curry (Thai hot) was very very good.  They use real coconut milk and don’t skimp on the curry powder.  Very flavorful.  The spicy basil fried rice was good but I wish I’d have gotten Thai hot in it too.  Thai hot was not as spicy as I was hoping, but it was very good.  Definitely call ahead.< /text>

I had an issue with a postmates driver when the order was mixed up and he refused to go back to the restaurant and correct it. We called Ayara and they were super nice about it, someone who worked there personally drove to deliver our food. Was very happy with the food and customer service!</Review>

<review>I wish I had taken pics of the wings but we ate them to fast!! I've eaten her so many times it's ridiculous but I've never posted a review or took a pic. Crab fried rice is the bomb, Papaya salad is delicious and tastes just as good the next day. Pineapple fried rice isn't really my thing but every I've been with that orders it never wants to share so I'm assuming it's as delicious as everything else on the menu. The staff is great and the ambiance is laid back. There's two sections to tis restaurant. I've only ever eaten in the front section and there's generally a little bit of a wait which is a testament to how good and fresh the food is. You'll love it!!</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Super yummy spot! Came here for lunch yesterday around 12:15 and only had to wait a few minutes after adding my group to the waitlist from Yelp while driving over. My boyfriend and I each got a lunch special and shared things. I’m vegetarian and there are lots of veggie options. The staff was flexible about changing the beef in the lunch special to tofu. Also got tofu pad thai and veggie rolls as the starter. My boyfriend had a beef starter. We both had Thai iced coffee and the only thing I will say is that it was REALLY sweet, I would probably recommend asking for it less sweet unless you just love things extremely sweet. I would say this is really good classic Thai food, things pretty much tasted how we expected. Portions are huge! The rice to curry ratio was a little off though, we had extra soupy curry left after the rice was gone. Overall a yummy spot and recommend coming here!</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP-OwDiSdYsENHah0KXXCZKkjAyd2G5Rjy0dmf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2hgOvpviRkAmqp8BOe7zlODJi1ULUtazjspx8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_1Zq3FKOio_tQ4LhCy1VGkHhigCRQYyCNMvcu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPepQlUvoyjiLHQhBLP05hKcxd4sw16Swk5Q3ze=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1GQZLvFpcTaRgGWRUpN_ZDEXwDW_Xe-dEOT3D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwKn6nEc0Ud6Ee26MkjN7kbIDHP_GukaECdOuR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO67AGbqHWMbhlRueRtZotRZXgSG75p4u9u2XGl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b0cd606875b5:0x9b679271891c3125<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Excellent food, but be prepared to wait for it. Call-in orders have always been hit or miss (in January 2020 was the only call waiting and stayed on hold during non-rush business hours for 30+ min before giving up), and going pick-up only seems to have made things even worse. Recently ordered on Postmates and they kept the driver waiting almost an hour at the store, far beyond projected time.<//Text>

Everyone I know who lives in the area knows this place. The negative is there's usually a 15-30 min wait. But that's because it's too popular.  Food tastes great. Mango sticky rice is sooo good!<//review>

<review>I tried to order for dinner, but when the bearded guy asked me either white or brown rice, I replied, "steamed." But when he mentioned that those types of rice are cooked that way. I was stunned. I don't recall brown rice to be steamed.

Things got testy when the guy fell silent as I said that he's too rude. The menu was posted by the store window, but not on the table next to the cashier. This situation left me unsaid with hesitation until I got to the point that I left slowly upset.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Awesome Thai food! I've had Ayara in my Want To Go list for a while and finally tried it today. The Spicy Basil with Ground Chicken and brown rice was fantastic! They've also got large Singha beer for only $5! I ordered takeout and sat at their small patio tables to enjoy the evening. Highly recommended! I'll definitely be back!</Text>< GmapID>

Food was excellent and nice portions. I placed an order online for curbside pickup, followed the instructions to call upon arrival, and no one answered the phone after several tries. Spent unnecessary time waiting in my car. Would still recommend and will be returning.<//Review>

< review>
The food was delicious. The service was abysmal. I ordered online. It took an hour and a half to retrieve my order. There were at least 15-20 orders ready to go on a table inside the restaurant. There were at least that many people outside, either waiting to order, or to pick up their orders.

The problem was that there was no clear direction for the people congregating outside of the restaurant. Additionally, since there were so many people outside, it would have made sense to see if any of the orders on the table belonged to the throng outside.</review>

Everything was fine and tasty except the orders took long time before it was ready for a takeout cause they had to imply with the Covid regulations but allowing dining in the restaurant.<//text>

<review>I had a lovely lunch here with my boyfriend We had ordered the yellow curry and green curry, the papaya salad, pad Thai, fried rice, crispy pork, egg rolls, fried tofu, and probably more I can even remember. The point is, all of it was amazing! I do think my favorites were the curries and the papaya salad. We heated up the leftovers for the next few days and it was just as good, if not better! Everything we ordered was tasty and plenty of food for the price.<//review></record>

<response>None< /response><review>Ugh. Their covid set up for pick up is horrendous.They have a tiny little sign outside that says if you ordered online they'll bring your order outside to you, the only problem is nobody's bringing out orders.and then they have this little line that forces you to stand right next to people in order to go inside and tell them you're there to pick up. The pad Thai is blah. The other dishes I had were actually pretty good. But considering the other places nearby or just as good no point in dealing with the extra hassle or wait<//review></record></dataset><record>

I hate to write a bad review but this issue has happened multiple times now I really just can't give them the benefit of the doubt. The food was not made how I asked for it and really just doesn't taste as good as the Thai food I expected. The wait times are ridiculous, an HOUR after it was supposed to arrive. I tried to call but I was on hold for over 20 minutes and they never picked up the phone. It's the closest Thai place to me but I won't be ordering from here again.< /text>

Curbside pick-up system can be horrible. I’ve been on hold several times for over 15 minutes just to let them know I’ve arrived! They really should figure out a better pick-up system. Other than that the food itself if always amazing.</text>

This place has a surprisingly large amount of seating and is considered one of the top restaurants by LAX. The service is quick and they have a good meal menu. Their spice levels are very appropriate and can be adjusted according to anyone's tastes.  They also allow takeout orders.</text>

I had the pad see ew and the chicken wings for starter. The food tasted fresh and the value is best for the lunch set. Not a lot of options for customizing your entree, but the sauces on the side are available. The Thai tea is milkier than I'm used to, but was very tasty.<//review>

<Review>Order to go food through Door Dash Tuesday, July 24. I ordered pad see ew with crispy pork belly and tom kha soup with chicken and mushrooms.

The delivery was reasonable and I have no complaints. The food was overpriced from typical Thai food prices. With tip and delivery fee, I paid $30 and some change for my food.

Of the two things I ordered, I liked the soup over the noodles. The soup had nice flavor and spice. In my opinion, I think the soup was light on the chicken and mushrooms. I liked the aromatics in the soup, but I wished it was finely chopped or taken out of the soup. That’s just my opinion. The pad see ew was overall ok. There wasn’t much Chinese broccoli, too much egg, and the crispy pork belly was dry and over cooked.

I probably wouldn’t order/go to Ayara Thai again. Too much good food out there to choose from.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Ordered Panang curry, Pad Woon Sen, and veggie spring rolls for takeout on a Saturday night. Had to wait a bit for the order, even though I got there 5 minutes past the stated pick-up time. Got home to discover the Panang curry container was only half full. It was delicious, but for the dinner price, I expect a full container. The Pad Woon Sen was BURNT. Crispy black noodles and charred veggies. The burnt taste permeated the whole dish. Inedible. The veggie spring rolls saved the meal and review from 1 star status. Light, crisp, delicious. Probably won't get take-out from here again, although I might try dine-in so that I can get any issues rectified immediately.< /Text>< pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1547973430917, 'text': 'Hello Cyndi,\n\nThank you for your order and your review.  We’re sorry to hear these concerns and want to assure you of the following:\n\n-regarding the size of our curry dishes, we recently began using the quart-size containers instead of the pint-size containers which these dishes used to be packed in.  Doing this made the curry easier to handle from the upper rim, and if anything allowed us to add a little extra sauce to the overall order.\n\n-our version of the noodles has a drier consistency and is meant to have a roasted flavor.  While we inspect all our dishes before they are served, we will certainly consider your feedback as we continue making this staple.\n\nThank you again for letting us know of your thoughts, and we hope you consider dining with us again.\n\n-The Asapahu Family'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b0cd606875b5:0x9b679271891c3125<//Gmap_id></record>

I’ve been meaning to try this place since we moved to the area. I was surprised by the great reviews on Yelp so I was even more eager to try. Today, I was craving for a noodle soup so I guess it was the perfect time to check in. But I was overwhelmed by the great options and needless to say, ended up with no noodle soup. Lol. The food we ordered were delicious though so no regrets at all. We ordered Spicy Basil with Crispy Pork and Shrimp Paste Fried Rice. It was so delicious! I’m Filipino and the taste of these dishes were so close to home. Honestly my only issue was I was hoping there were more! Their Thai tea is very sweet, so depending on your sweetness tolerance, you may or may not like it. I liked it, especially with the contrast of the flavors from our meal. The interior looks very nice. And so was our server. So sad they ran out of the pumpkin creme brûlée. That would have been the perfect ender to our beautiful meal!</Text>

Great for lunch ! Get the lunch set . 20.00$ gets you beer, appetizer and a main course. I choose the chicken wings as an appetizer and the Pad Thai as the main course dish. Pad Thai was a little on the bland side. Missing the tamarind flavor which gives this national Thai dish a sweet and sour tanginess.</text>

I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. Ka prao, Pad see ew, and pad Thai are my usual go to's.

There is a parking lot in the back but it's usually full. I have better luck with street parking.< /review><user_id>104375606545703587859</user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2b0cd606875b5:0x9b679271891c3125< /gmap_id><username>Robert D. Olmo</username>< response>

First... NEVER had Pineapple Fried Rice MADE WITH SPAGHETTI SAUCE... and for $14 a plate???... the good thing was the Drunken Noodles... easy 8.5 out of 10...  at $18 a plate, the price was a 5.0 out of 10... had much better for a lot less...elsewhere... (had 10 out of 10 for only $12 a plate)... couldn't even eat the SPAGHETTI SAUCE FRIED RICE WITH PINEAPPLES... (AKA Pineapple Fried Rice)... was happy that UberEats could deliver it, though... $91.00 for like $48.00 worth of average 4.5 out of 10 star food (that would be 2.25 stars out of 5 stars)<//Text>

I ordered my food and it took 45 mins my friend order 5 mins after me and his food never came out after 1.5 hours! Horrible service. You cant just keep telling people to wait 15 mins when they follow up on their order. Food itself gets 3 stars in my opinion.

My friend ended up ordering is food at a different Thai restaurant, there it took actually 15mins as advertised< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Don't order from here they're expensive and don't care for their customers! I ordered 3 meals of Pad See Ew and specifically said less eggs and less vegetables. They purposely put way less noodles than they put on average. I order from here often but yesterday was my last. The amount of noodles they gave me was insulting. Won't be ordering here anymore. I felt like on purpose they put less because of my instructions.< /Text><response>{'time': 1595298844136, 'text': 'Hi Anthony,\n\nYou just got off the phone with our manager regarding your complaint, and while we apologize that this was not to your liking, we also explained that after seeing your request for extra noodles very clearly on the order, we made sure that all 3 orders of Pad See Ew were prepared with double the noodles in weight compared to how much is normally included.  This typically comes at an extra charge, which we chose to waive since you did request to remove the eggs and have minimal vegetables.  We also explained to you that 4 of our Team Members, including the Wok Chef who cooked the orders, all took note of the double portion of noodles.  The three dishes were also reviewed by our Front of House team before being packaged to ensure accuracy.\n\nDespite following your request to the letter, we’re sorry that this is how you have chosen to proceed.  You mentioned several times that you will be going to a different restaurant from now on, and while we will not beg you to return, we want to thank you for your support and wish you the best during this time.'}<//response>< rate>

A little disappointing that they did not have one of the more classic Thai desserts available, The Sweet Rice with Mango. However, this restaurant more than deserves 5 stars. Their curry was absolutely amazing! The coconut flavor in the curry was prevalent but not overpowering like most. This is the first place in years that I was able to finish all the curry without any meat left. Not as relevant to the foodies, nonetheless, the ginger tea that they serve is absolutely amazing. Flavorful and strong, yet it had a smooth finish. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to my closest friends and family.< /Text>

While we’re sorry you felt we were being rude, when you arrived there were other guests in line ahead of you who were waiting to be served.  When you were trying to receive service in front of them, we asked you to wait in line, a policy which we also posted at the door to ensure everyone receives equal service.  Since the order you picked up was for the Doordash customer you were delivering it for, we are unsure how you formulated the opinion that it was “disgusting”.\n\nThank you again for your review.

Very nice restaurant. It's clean and casual. The food was quick and easy to order. It came out hot and tasting delicious. Our servers didn't get us water refills until we were about to leave and the water cups are small so it can be finished in about two gulps. Not sure why we had 2 servers and no one checked on any guests. Food is good, staff not so much.< /review>

A good spot with lot of tables inside. The lunch option is great and would recommend to go for the premium since it covers a drink as well. A bit disappointed with the spice level since the food for a bit bland compared to an authentic Thai place in terns of the spices. Service is affected during busy hours as we had to go down and request for service everytime we needed something at our table and we saw the same innearby tables as well. You might not face this problem if you are seated in the set of tables up front. Street parking is available plentiful in the vicinity and overall a good place for lunch. As recommended in yelp and opther online platforms, it is well advised to book your table before you reach since the place is of high demand on Fridays and weekends.</Review>

Ayara is my favorite Thai restaurant. This is actually my first Thai restaurant I ever recall going to. My coworkers & I ubered here & it was definitely worth the ride.

I loved it so much I introduced my other friends & boyfriend here. The only downfall is that it is a bit pricey. So be ready to spend some money. My boyfriend & I got three items from the menu. I ordered Papaya Salad, Crab Fried Rice & he ordered Spicy Chicken Basil. The order was an easy $50+.

The Papaya Salad is the best papaya salad I've had. I have visited many Thai restaurants trying all their crab & vegetable fried rice but no one, I repeat NO ONE tops Ayara! Their crab salad is made with REAL Dungeness Crab Meat. It's so freaking good. I top it off with the Thai Chilis in Fish Sauce. It's mouth watering good!

The service here is excellent! One time I ordered the Basil Fried Rice Mild Spicy & for some reason it was entirely too spicy for me (the chili peppers were probably extra spicy that season) & I asked if I could exchange it for the regular Basil Fried Rice & they exchanged it no questions asked or extra charge. I was so happy!!!!

I never had to wait more than 3 minutes for seating. The space looks small when you walk in, but then it opens up wider in the back. The decor is pretty cute too. My boyfriend loved it so much, he wanted to recreate the wall with the elephant/animal figurines.

If you are ever visiting in Los Angeles please go and visit Ayara. It is located near the Los Angeles airport. You will not regret it unless you forget your wallet lol! Now go make your palate happy! ^_^</review>

<text>Definitely better than your typical Thai restaurant as their dishes do have distinct Thai flavors rather than bland noodles/rice thrown together with some vegetables and meat. Having said that it didn't blow me away as well and felt it fell short of spice levels which are authentic to the Thai cuisine.</text></record></dataset><record>
<Text>I ordered pick up today, I went there and waited 28 minutes for my order!. When I placed my order on line I specifically set 1230 pick up time. I got there and waited for an employee to show up probably 10 minutes after, then he (nicely) asked for my name, and asked me to wait outside. After that I waited over 18 minutes for my food. I saw curbside parking customers also waiting for their food longer than usual.< /Text><pics>None</pics><user_id>107778383174955402595<//user_id>< Gmap_id>

My wife, I and my 3 children ages 13, 10 and 1 1/2 love to eat at Ayara. It's # 1 on our list of favorite Thai restaurants in Los Angeles. We can't wait for them to bring back sticky mango rice and the fried bananas. Thank you for excellent service and really delicious food. See you soon.</text>

<Review>Always outstanding food, with a good selection of traditional curries and noodles and a few more creative interpretations of Thai cooking. They deserve special recognition for the great selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Service is warm and efficient, prices are reasonable bordering on bargains for the quality of the food. They use the Yelp waitlist, which worked for me.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_AYiSt3b4z3CilFgx32xOBvrFkb9WM9dZqW-2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Name>Patrick Larvie<//Name>< time>

<text>As much as I really wanted to like this place I was very displeased with my order tonight. Although, the place was really cute inside and I bet has a lovely ambiance when open normally without COVID going on. But my togo order was very much lacking.

This is a picture of a simple order of Wonton Soup. Nothing else. Which ran me $14 + tax & tip (of course) so roughly over $16. Which I was ok with and ready to give them my business. The soups flavor was ok but not flavorful. I had to add a ton of hot sauce to it to actually enjoy. All 3 maybe 4 wontons end up falling apart inside the soup. The container was very small, as you can see, for a $14 dollar soup. The veggies took up most of the container space. Even then still felt jipped.

The nice lady, who put in my order, was what I assumed pretty busy with an end of the night rush. She must of just forget to put in my utensils and napkins. I just assumed everything was there because the bag was folded up and taped. My suggestion next time maybe allow the customer to put in the contents of the soup at their discretion. This can help alleviate most of the problems. Sorry, I have to be that guy and write this review.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Good food but short on staff. They do their best. Called in for a fried rice and it took about an hour. When I got there (been a while since I've been back) there was crowd confusion as to who was there to dine in versus takeout orders. A bit of a cluster(you know what) one might say. The chicken fried rice was worth the wait.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I ordered and paid and they said 30-45 minutes. They said they'd would call me when it was ready and I waited outside. At their admission, they gave my order to someone else. All said, it took more than 2 hours to get my food, 2 entrees, nothing complex. They also refused to give me my money back so I could go somewhere else. I won't be returning until they get a handle on the basics.

Edit: after all of this, I guess this is my fault, and I should have checked more thoroughly before i left. They screwed up my order. As I ordered and as per my receipt, I was supposed to get yellow curry, but i got red. I was supposed to get 2 orders of brown rice, i got 1 of white rice. I'm never coming back here, i suggest you save your time and money and spend them both elsewhere.<//text>

I had a dinner gathering last night for five guests and decided to order Joom café. Eaten here a few other times and have always enjoyed it. I'll spare the details but ordered six dishes and all of them were absolutely amazing! If you look at my reviews for other places you can tell that I'm a bit picky but would certainly eat here again!</Review>

Decided to come back because before coming I read the reviews and they were all positive. Glad I went back. Food is GOOD. Had the papaya salad, medium heat. If you don't like spice, ask for little heat, because medium was HOT. Had the green curry with chicken. Perfect blend of heat and coconut milk. Portions are big in my opinion. The ambiance is a bit lacking; good place for a quick lunch with friends though. Wait time was minimal. Service was efficient and pleasant.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The food was portioned good for its prices and it was for too. The inside if the establishment had a calm atmosphere.  When we arrived there were people waiting in the cold to be called. The only reason why i wouldn't give this place a 5 star,  I'd like to see a difference in the waiting area. On the plus side they did have a system everyone had you sign in to be called on.< /review>

Seriously, we loved it! From the cocktails, to the food, every single thing we had was amazing. Someone told us to get the wings and it was a great option. You can definitely understand why it is rated so highly! Space is limited in the restaurant so be advised to come early to get a seat! This is just filler to get to the word limit< /review>

One of my favorite Thai restaurants on the westside.  They always have good energy and good wait staff, but the price can be a little pricey if you want to leave full...but it's worth it. The Curry Noodles is my favorite dish.< /review>

Ayara Thai Cuisine has delicious and very flavorful food! The dishes are unique and prepared very well. I can definitely understand why they have a Michelin Star. The service was also very good and we were seated within 15 minutes on a busy Saturday night. Would come back again next time we visit LA.< /Review>

Look, I am a pilot for an American Airline. I have had Thai food all over the country, in fact all over the world. The food at this place is some of the best I've had in the United States. I found a place in Seattle that is better, but you can't go wrong with the food here. I always order the same thing. Green curry on the low spice side, prawns, and white rice. That way I have a benchmark. This place is not the Ritz-Carlton of restaurants, but the service is great and the food is really quite tasty. You will not be disappointed.</Text>

Long wait list and small ramen shop had us wander across to Ayara. The food is truly authentic and not your typical versions of common Thai dishes. Place is very close to LAX and good street parking. Super fast service and lots of tables.< /Review>< name>

<review>We came here on a Sunday night. The restaurant has nice ambience and friendly/attentive staffs. The food took a long time before they came out of the kitchen, but our server gave us a heads up and apologized profusely as the kitchen was slammed. To make it up to us, she comped half my meal without us asking. The food was amazing and totally makes up for the slow service. In hindsight, I think we would have been fine if we had first ordered an appetizer to share. All good though, I would definitely return if I'm in neighborhood again.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b0cd606875b5:0x9b679271891c3125</gmap_id></record>

<Review>Food is pretty good. The crab fried rice is a bit bland and the same goes for the curry, but they do use quality ingredients, which is a plus. Service is also good as well.< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

I'm giving it 4 stars because my girlfriend loves this place. I'm not so much a fan. The food is... good. I didn't find it memorable. I really don't care for the atmosphere. Super bright lighting with weird nautical props all over the wall. Tables are also very close to each other. I make her get take out because I don't wanna be in that room again.</text>

Out of all of the Thai restaurants in LA I have tried this is the best thus far. However, not the best I have ever had and is why I am only giving the restaurant a 4/5. We tried the fried tofu, chicken sate, tom kha, panang curry, massaman curry, papaya salad, Chinese broccoli, cashew nut and kra tiem. All of which were good but not amazing. Still looking for that next level of Thai here in LA and will find it but this is a good option if you want Thai.<//Text>

Nice cozy Thai restaurant with a delicious selection of food. But don't expect a large menu of items. All they cook fits on one side of a standard sheet of paper. I had the pork belly, as well the curry and the fried rice. The fried rice was so good, I didn't want to soak it in curry, so I ate it by itself. There are three dining areas, however they seemed reluctant to opening them, because we waited a while, only to be the first seated in the empty topmost dining area.< /Review>

<Text>I ate here for the second time as my going away dinner. I can't remember the name of the dishes but we had the peanut sauce spring roll? Tofu Satay, tofu pad Thai and the best dish was the catfish and eggplant. The place was nice and quiet and the food was amazing. Not too sweet like most American Thai restaurants.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>My friends and I been eating Thai food in L.A. for about 40 years when we first were introduced to a little Thai restaurant just outside Chinatown.  Ayara is the best since then and we have looked for many years.

<Review>We came here on a Sunday night. The restaurant has nice ambience and friendly/attentive staffs. The food took a long time before they came out of the kitchen, but our server gave us a heads up and apologized profusely as the kitchen was slammed. To make it up to us, she comped half my meal without us asking. The food was amazing and totally makes up for the slow service. In hindsight, I think we would have been fine if we had first ordered an appetizer to share. All good though, I would definitely return if I'm in neighborhood again.< /Review><Time>1545030435061<//Time><user_id>105328360821617422700< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>LOVED this place. Kind of hard to find, since it's kind of like in a hotel. It's small so expect a wait if you don't make a reservation.

<Review>The worst Pad Thai chicken I've tried in LA. It had no flavor like the usual sweet taste. It was lousy. I'm very disappointed. It's not worth the price. The waiter came to us only one time when we had a few dirty plates on our table and he didn't take them away! We were shocked. It wasn't even a busy day for him. He looked lazy.
And the coconut ice cream was not good at all. I usually love Thai food restaurants but this one was truly not a good place at all.</Review><response>{'time': 1521759886498, 'text': "This is disappointing to hear. While our Pad Thai recipe uses tamarind, fish sauce, and palm sugar - and typically not as sweet as other restaurants - we cannot say that it isn't sweet at all.

<text>I travel to Nakhon Ratchasima and Phitsanulok on a regular and frequent basis so I am very familiar with all types of Thai food (from fine cuisine to street fare and home-cooked meals).
I ordered a dish and asked for "mild spice". The dish I was served was insanely spicy with a ridiculous amount of garlic. It burned in a BAD way and was completely inedible for me.
I did not request a refund or replacement, but also, no one was really going overboard trying to apologize or offer any of these things.
Bottom Line- I will never return here, but - to be fair- I'm sure some fire-eaters and/or masochists will like it.< /text>< pics>

Ordered the crab fried rice. The crab didn’t taste like crab. Although the look and texture was like crab, it tasted more like white fish. I was disappointed. The waiter took it back and gave some half sensical excuse about it not being totally fresh crab, but not from the can either. Huh? Anyhow... guess I’ll stick with Natalie Thai.</review>

<review>Strip mall location and mediocre interior didn't inspire confidence in the expected quality of this place. I was completely was surprised by the fantastic quality. My stuffed baby eggplant was unbelievably delicious. Lots of garlic and onions, and nicely spicy, it was the perfect dish for me. I highly recommend this place. There's plenty of free parking behind the building and a few out front.<//review><pics>None<//pics></record>

<Review>Delicious as always. This is my Westchester/LAX go to spot. Portions are not large but so tasty. There was a pretty long line for a Thursday night and lots of people getting pick up and order out. I think they have a Yelp check in on line bc they have a tablet out front to check in on. I'll def do that in advance next time. But being busy I think shows how yummy it is. This time I got the drunken noodles with chicken and the thai basil fried rice with shrimp. Both good. I was surprised at how tender the chicken was. Most Thai and Chinese restaurants chicken is a bit dry but not Ayara. Best parking is in the shopping lot just down the way from the restaurant. Behind Staples.  It's a busy street and better to just walk a bit.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< review>
Today, I was craving for a noodle soup so I guess it was the perfect time to check in. But I was overwhelmed by the great options and needless to say, ended up with no noodle soup. Lol. The food we ordered were delicious though so no regrets at all. We ordered Spicy Basil with Crispy Pork and Shrimp Paste Fried Rice. It was so delicious! I'm Filipino and the taste of these dishes were so close to home. Honestly my only issue was I was hoping there were more! Their Thai tea is very sweet, so depending on your sweetness tolerance, you may or may not like it. I liked it, especially with the contrast of the flavors from our meal. The interior looks very nice. And so was our server. So sad they ran out of the pumpkin creme brûlée. That would have been the perfect ender to our beautiful meal!<//review>

<review>Wow wow wow! Amazing food! So yummy and the Tom Kah soup was honestly heavenly. This place is very casual and the food taste and presented in a very formal manner. The soup alone is worth the try! Only reason I scored them lower was because they seem understaff and service is a little slow specially in a lunch rush. But either way the food deserves the high score.< /review>< Date>

They need to figure out a better waitlist system.

We checked into the Yelp waitlist in advance. Arrived at the restaurant and checked in with the person at the front. At that point there was 7 people ahead of us on the list, and the expected wait was about 15 minutes. 50 minutes later, there's still 4 people on the list ahead of us, so we check back in with the front to see how much longer the wait will be. Turns out the person at the front has another list of names on a notepad, and says they've seen us waiting around for a while, so would put us at the top of the list. Appreciated the gesture, but it was too little, too late.

What's the point of having one waitlist on Yelp, and a totally different waitlist on paper? And how many times are you supposed to check in with the front to make sure you're on the _right_ waitlist? Maybe we'll stop back by for takeout sometime, but the dining in experience was a total bust.<//review>

<Review>Really like this place. They have a wide variety of dishes. The taste and portions are also pretty good and match the price tag. Everything is worth trying from the soups to their amazing drunken noodles!
Setting is pretty good. Everything is clean and neat.
Even on a busy day they manage to get great service up until the point where you get the check, I have had to walk up to the front to make the payment.< /Review>< Time>

The wait time was short and this Thai place is close to the airport but the food and service were very disappointing, my friend liked the pineapple fried rice but the chicken pad thai was some of the worst I've had, the noodles were kind of soggy and not lots of flavor and we had minimal service! We wont be coming back!< /text>

Smelled like clorox or some type of cleaning solution where they sat us. Also it looked like they just added out two seater table in the middle of two other tables, so our table was literally touching each other who were strangers at their own table! Made me want to vomit. Restroom flooded from toilet overflow so floor was soaked. Food came out and portions were so small.<//Text>< rate>

Not a big fan, the place is small and can be crowded and noisy, there were two young student couples who were laughing so hard and screaming the entire time,  it sounded louder than a nightclub with  their blunt indifferent yells, screams and laughs the entire time and nobody asked them to lower their tone. There's no music so all we heard was loud talk and hysterical laugsh the entire time that we couldn't even talk.
The menu text was too small and we had to figure out all the alternatives you chose from for each dish, they don't have a big variety of vegetables except as sides.
one thing I like was the  cold water with a tiny 🍋 slice  served in metal cups that were refreshing.
The kitchen closes at 10 on weekdays so it was convenient and s plus In the area.

I wasn't a big fan of the soup, neither the overpowering  grilled garlic taste , the taste was too plain. I  ordered the bowl, I've never had such a small portion. It tasted like Sasha noodle packs that you can make at home.
The cup of rice noodle was very sticky and we were charged.  I like their thai tea at least that was worth it.<//Text>

I was a little worried pulling up to this place. There was a 20-30 minute wait (that actually was more like 10).  We ordered a fresh coconut appetizer, fried tofu, curry and spring rolls, as well as fresh mango and sticky rice for dessert. I had two kids with me and they loved the food and were treated with respect. Food was great and will be back!!<//Text>

Ive eaten here a few times, my wife has too even though we have never eaten here together we both agree that this is a nice Thai food gem.

You cant go wrong with the Pad Thai (shrimp), the Drunken noodles (if you like spicy) or Panaag or Red Curry.

I like spicy so those are my go toos.

Every time Ive been here for lunch the place has been PACKED i mean PACKED which in this case is because the food is great.

Service is friendly, this is a family owned business so I think theres more emphasis on the customer experience.

In the handful of times I have been here the food has always come out piping hot, just like I ordered, smooth service and great food.

Parking can be a bit of a pain in this area but there is a big lot close by.
Definitely check it out when you are in the neighborhood.
Great place to eat if you are in the mood for Thai<//Text>< pics>

Something about the heaping pile of crispy onions and perfectly toasted sesame buns was just so very satisfying. It's shareable, but if you're feeling adventurous, then have at it. You'll have no regrets.

Also really enjoyed the ribs and the crisp beers on what was a rare warm SF evening.

Found this place taking my daughter to the airport.  Best pad thai noodles I have tried thus far. Not sure if it's a slight use of vinegar they use in it or what, but it's great. I squeeze some of the lime on top and it's bomb.  Next best thing I tried was their ayara fried rice with chicken. Incredible!  Had to other dishes, but I forgot what they were, because the pad Thai and ayara rice overshadowed them... Actually, it was the yellow curry (they called it something else that started with an "m". It has butternut squash and nuts. Tasty, but not the best we've had). Would definitely come back just for the rice and pad Thai.</text>

<review>If your ordering to go call in advance. This place is busy busy busy. People are walking in and out every minute.

The serivce is great. All the servers and cashier are working hard. None were standing around or had side conversation.

Ayara is decorated nicely. The waiting area is tiny. You will start to fill closed in after 2 mins. They provide seats outside for guest waiting. You can add your name to the waiting list at Kiosk infront.

The FOOD is soooo good. The taste the smell everything about it. The wait for the food.was long but worth every second. All the food is hot and fresh. They have Vegan, Vegetarian and meat options.</review><user_name>Shanti Collins<//user_name>< Date>

<Text>We have been coming here since the first week it opened (15 years ago?).  The food is fantastic...the best Thai in the area.  As evidence, the place is super crowded most nights, especially weekends. Highly recommend!  The crispy wontons are our favorite, but all the appetizers are all great. My wife adores the Pad Thai.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Very good Curry and very good Pad Say Ew.  Waiting area to be seated is woefully inadequate and disturbing.  All they need to do is put stools, benches, or chairs outside to alleviate this simple to fix problem!  I just don't get it...

A relatively nice interior and a friendly waiter, with an okay exterior in a small building with less than a handful of other store fronts, in an okay area.  However, 5 minutes from LAX and free parking along the curb.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I was so excited to try Ayara based on the great reviews, however I must admit I was a bit disappointed.   I ordered the two dishes that were recommended.  Jade Curry and Pad Thai with a side of Peanut Sauce.   Let me start with the Jade Curry.  By itself, the jade curry was rather bland.   But when you mix it with the rice there is something that makes the curry come alive.  I'd give that a 4star rating.  It's the pad Thai that disappointed me the most.   It was dry amd the flavor was just average.   I did place my order to go, so possibly that contributed to my average food experience.  I will go back and give them a second chance, while trying some other dishes.   One thing to mention  is the parking.   It's always busy, even with a shopping parking lot nearby.< /Review>

<response>None<//response><review>Popular Thai restaurant in Weschester.  The place is larger than it looks from the entrance.  If there is a wait, you need to sign you self in outside onto the waitlist.  Had the Tom Yum Soup with Drunken Noodles.

Protein options are: Chicken, Pork, Shrimo, Scallops, Seafood (?) & Duck.

Worth a try if in the area.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The service was spectacular!
We had a table with an iced tea no ice order, a strict vegetarian, and two food allergies. Our waitress, Mandy, came back to the table with each dish and confirmed our special orders, and thought ahead to bring water with no ice, cautioned about condiments that contained fish sauce, and offered to substitute jalapeno for the bell pepper allergy.

And the food was fantastic, vegetable tom yum, beef Thai garden, vegetable fried rice without egg (as cautioned by Mandy), and Ayara rice with chicken and beef.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b0cd606875b5:0x9b679271891c3125<//Gmap_id></record>

Great food. We actually prefer to fly out of lax so we have a reason to come here. The service has been outstanding. Note... it's a "team" approach to serving where you may have up to three separate waiters. It seems like chaos but I'm always pleasantly surprised at how quickly the food arrives.< /text>

Pricey food and terrible service. Server missed an item in our order. Upon asking put the blame on us that we never ordered the said item. No protectiveness even with the most basic stuff like filling empty glasses with water. We had to request our server atleast 3 times before we were given water.</Review>

Exceptial, Fantastic, Delicious. Can't go wrong.  Small, friendly,  so so tasty and yummy yummy. Not to small,  when I say small.  Love to give 10 stars.  Sooo much I wanted to order,  but eating alone.  Got seatted in a comfortable spot for even eating alone.  Really like I got seated right next to the kitchen door.  I got to check out everything everyone ordered.  And WOW! Worked in the restaurant business year's ago.  This place is awesome! If you like beer, they got a 85 Oz. Beer. to order.  For this visit I chose the Thai ice tea,  yum.  Had to be able to make it back the Hotel.  ;) If ya looking for a place to try Thai for the 1st time or need to really enjoy the flavors of cooking.  This is the place.  I ate really slowly, the soup for example, which helped me to really to tune into the flavors.  Was in heaven.  Will be flying back into LAX just to eat here once again.

I used to go out of my way for their lunch specials (my favorite was yellow curry, spicy beef salad, white rice and a small salad- super tasty dressing). They recently reopened and lunch specials... GONE! yellow curry... GONE! Before they closed for remodeling, they would be packed from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. This time I went like 12:30 or so... NOT PACKED!

Little Thai place in the back side of a strip mall near LAX... with excellent food. Have not yet had much of the menu here, but everything so far has been delicious.

Just pay attention to Google Maps when looking for the place-- it really is on the back side of the parking lot, NOT the Sepulveda side!</text>

The food was excellent, and prepared well The presentation of the Butterfly Shrimp wonton was tasty, and superb! I would recommend this dish to anyone. First time having this dish!  Another good dish that I had was Curry fried rice, and I added seafood and stir fried vegetables. The consistency of the dish was not wet, and it was perfect.<//Text>

Everything about this restaurant is spot on. There isn't  a single dish I've tried that I haven't been impressed with. And the staff is nice and attentive. Only thing is that sometimes you have to wait 1.5 hours for your carry out order.</text>

Located in close proximity to LAX. Celebrity go to place and if noodles are something you like, I definitely recommend Ayara.

Does not look like much from the outside, yet inside there are three rooms and excellent cuisine.

Was a nice stopover as we were picking up friends from LAX. Fresh ingredients and this one is on Zagat.</Text>

In town for the weekend and decided to give this place a try. The atmosphere and decor was really nice and the food was amazing. I had the lobster pad Thai. The prices are a bit higher than other Thai places I’ve been to but that was my only concern.<//Review>

I've been a patron of this place well over 10 years. Since their doors first opened.. well before the expansion and bottled products; and EVERYTHING tastes exactly like it did 10-12 years ago.  I love Ayara's food.  Its consistent. Never dissapointed. Very much worth the wait.  The beautiful Matriarch is still in the kitchen doing what she loves and keeping it authentic.  And most importantly; she is passing on her legacy to her children. Great food.. service.. and prices. Thank you for not making this into a chain establishment.<//text>

Love coming to Ayara with friends and family. Jade curry is excellent and they have great appetizers, including the Muay Thai Wings. Great Thai restaurant for a night out with groups. It's always busy, so placing reservations may be a good idea.< /Review>

I believe their prices went up and their portions got smaller. It's also unfortunate that after being closed for renovations for what seemed like at least 1.5 years, they didn't even put a fresh coat of paint on the place. A few noticable changes were made. A sign claims they had challenges that curtailed their goals, but it's still the same old place with poor service and good, yet now over priced food.<//Text>< Pics>

A very good place...went there on what I read in here.  First time to the place.  Not into chain places when traveling...like the ma and pa places.  A nice gem!  Fresh everything.....and if you like hot and spicy - this is the place.  If not, you can have them cool it.  I am in LAX for the week and suppose I will be back 2 or 3 times for dinner.  It's busy so come and prepare to wait.<//text>

Flavorful and delicious Thai food that either melts or explodes in your mouth. I recommend to try their Massaman beef curry, carmelized pork belly that melts in your mouth, and the Yaowaraj noodles that's satisfying.
The wait for a party of 4 on a Saturday night was about 30mins, and the staff kept us up to date about the availability of our table.
Service was prompt and responsive, at times giving us some piece of information about our meals. Towards the end of the meal, the owner approached us and asked about our dining experience.
Highly recommend this place if you happen to be in the area.<//text>

GREAT thai food. This will be my new place to eat every time I fly in or out of LAX. Very popular. Clean. Super fresh tasting food. Novel dishes I haven't seen before like this delicious thing call Royal Crispy Baskets !!  Yum !< /text>

This experience was wonderful.  It was close to the airport and easy to find. Our party of three on a Monday night ran into no wait, and we were surprised how comfortable (very not loud!) the atmosphere was.  The service was wonderful.  We never felt rushed, and never felt like we were waiting.

The three appetizers we got (When Tigers cry, Chicken Sate, and Royal Golden Baskets) were phenomenal, and our three entrees (Crazy Fish, Ka-Pow and the Soft shell crab special) were equally impressive.  I expected the prices to be higher for food of this quality.

This is one of those restaurants that's perfect to take friends from out of town, but given the low prices I'd also not hesitate going there any time I just wanted some amazing food.< /Text>

My favorite thai restaurant with one of the best Tom Yum Soup and Crispy Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli. If the Mango Sticky Rice is in season for dessert, it's a must-have! Opt for making reservations as the wait can get pretty long even on weeknights.</Text>

Best thai dishes one can find around LA.
Better to get there before 7 pm otherwise the wait might take up to 30 minutes although the wait is worth

UPDATE AS OF JULY 29TH
Be ready to pay more for less

After almost a year waiting for the remodeling to be done we found out that this place is finally open.
I was excited to go back to see the results just to find out that almost 85% of the restaurant remains the same (lame).
What surprised me the most was the fact that they raised the prices for every single plate and we actually were given less food.
This place went from a Delicious and affordable Thai food spot to a why the hell I'm paying $25 for a sea food soup. Yes!! You read that right, $25 for a soup that was only  added two big ass shrimps onto, but don't get me wrong, food was ok buy i was expecting more for the price<//Text>

The menu is pared down but creative and everything we ordered was delicious: roast duck salad, crab fried rice, lobster pad Thai. One drawback to the nicely priced $2 Thai Iced tea -- we didn't try it because they said it's made with Mocha Mix. Look up the ingredients to see how unhealthy that stuff is.</text>< username>

<review>My husband and I went last week. The menu has changed and the food was not good! You can tell that they have cut corners because the food was very bland. I ordered the glass noodle salad and it was terrible. I sent it back and decided not to order another dish. Next time I'm going to Thai town on Sunset for REAL Thai food!<//review>< Pics>

<date>1532576179023<//date><rate>1< /rate><text>I had just flown into LA and was looking forward to my first meal here. When we arrived,  there was a sign in book outside the restaurant,  so we signed in and waited outside. Even though several servers passed by inside, no one came out to check on us, so we went inside and waited on the empty bench. No one greeted us or even acknowledged our presence. We were waiting about 10 minutes when a group of people came in, and were immediately greeted warmly by an older Thai lady wearing a grey and white bandana  (the hostess?), and she asked them how many were in their party. I said, "Excuse me, but we have been waiting to be seated." I thought maybe they thought we were waiting on take out. She replied,  very nastily, "Yes, I know you are waiting. Don't get upset." I was very tIaken aback by her response,  since my tone was not rude at all.  She seated us shortly after that, but her attitude pretty much ruined the meal. My massaman curry was good, but not great. I counted maybe 5 peanuts and 3 potato chunks. My husband's wonton soup was good, but they brought it out several minutes before my meal came, so the soup got slightly cold waiting. Our waitress was polite and attentive, but it's too bad the hostess's rudeness ruined the meal. Needless to say,  we won't be going back.  I regret that this was my first experience with the LA food scene.  I hope it's not representative of what to expect from the rest of my stay.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Ayara has been my favorite restaurant for years. Tonight my husband & I took his niece & her boyfriend there; they're visuting from Oregon. We all had a lovely meal. If I'd known Google was going to ask me for a review, I would have taken a picture of some of our food!</Text></record>

When it comes to food genres, Thai is not near the top of my list. That being said, I really like Ayara Thai. For me to really like a Thai place, when I'm not even a huge fan of the genre, the food must be pretty good.

Everything from the pad thai to the curries and soups is delicious at Ayara. If you make reservations ahead of time, they're good with handling medium-to-large sized groups. The service is always good and it's hard to go wrong with almost anything on the menu. You'll spend about $15-20 per person in the end, but everyone will be satisfied with the meal at one of LA's hidden Thai gems.<//Text>

Great food, but if I didn't want the bother of a waiter, I would've ordered takeout. They literally gave us our food and didn't hear from them until they brought the check. I brought my girlfriend there for her birthday. 😕<//Review>

Ayara is a nice local place with consistent food and reasonable prices. We've only ever had take-out but the small dining room seems decent.</review>

< Review>
Food was delicious. I was a big fan of the spices used. Restaurant is quite large and seemed to be very full the Sunday we went. Food took a little longer for is because there was a backup on the currys (waiter said a lot of people had ordered it). There is also plenty of parking nearby.<//Review>

< Review>
I've had a few bad experiences at this place but today takes the cake. We had a group of 15 people. We ordered ahead of time. We show up and the hostess was pretty rude as she seated us. And then the fun starts. They had prepared only half the orders. Those were served after 15 minutes and COLD. The rest weren't even ready.

Never again will wet go back here.</Review>

The Tom Yum was mediocre at best, it was basically bland broth with a couple shrimp.  Combo rice was under seasoned, shame when you have to request soy sauce.  Pad Thai was extremely dry, I actually took some broth from the soup to loosen it up.  I had high hopes and was disappointed. However, this place is a decent option in an area lacking many restaurants.< /text>< Pics>

Ayara Thai Cuisine is a little pearl in the Westchester area. If you are visiting around the LAX area, stop by for a nice lunch or dinner.<//Review>

<Review>Was introduced to this place this friday. It was suggested to get the appetizer shrimp.. well I must say I had the shrimp cigars b4 but the freshness of the shrimp was what stuck out to me.  Very good.

I have not been here for over 3 years and have to say the quality of the food has definitely gone down and the prices have gone up...
I know they were closed for over 2 years for a remodeled but the place looks exactly the same except for the service counter at the front entrance....HAS AYARA CHANGED OWNERS because my Massaman Curry was NOT good and my Thai ice coffee was awful...
Very disappointed this was my favorite Thai food spot on the Westside...<//review>

We went around 4pm and ordered phad thai and crab fried rice. The dishes could not be made spicy and Sriracha was served on the side. I get phad thai whenever I eat at a Thai restaurant and their version was fairly mediocre. The crab fried rice was just that and nothing else. We paid a pretty good price for nothing special. Service was fine.</review>

I dont get the Complaint here from past posters.
Everything about Ayara is awesome!
People are nice, the food is awesome, Thai ice Tea is to die for!
The Sake is great, the Plum Wine is Very sweet and tasty!
The Spring rolls, Tiger Cry, Pork Noodle Soup, The Pad Thai, Pork Belly Brocoli, Glass noodle chicken or beef, Crab fried Rice. Everything on the Menu is Awesome! One guy posted about being late. They Close at 10pm!! HELLO!!! Every if you goto Burger King they will refuse service 15 minutes even 30 minutes before closing time! You were unreasonable to post that they refuse service to you, You were late so get over yourself! The Service is great They get busy from 6 to 10pm, so get there early! Awesome Food! Keep up the Great Work, Been coming for 6 years now. Just Awesome Food!<//Review>

Food is good but Service is bad.
I was very regular for the Ayara fried rice.
This is the third time may be the last time I will have food here.
Asked for water 3 times and he bought it by the end of the meal.
The last time was, a friend of mine gifted an ayara gift card worth $20 and it did not work, fortunately the friend who gave the gift card was with me that day. Else I would have never known that the gift card had $20.  The manager at ayara told her that there is no money in the card first. My friend told there should be $20. 10 mins later manager comes back and says there is $5 in the card. Then they took the card and the number and told us they will get back to us. Its been six months and this time they recognized us and told us that my friend should get a call soon. It never did.
There was no apology what so ever for the mistake they did and the $20 forget about it.
Its been 6 months from now.< /review>

We came to 87th st, they moved to sepulveda bvd. We found then a trendy style restaurant and... an small menu with expensive prices. Far from the humble thai restaurant with small prices I expected.
I took a pad thai, the plate was small and they were so few noodles!
It was such a disappointment, a culture and a humility lost against trends and money.
If you're searching for real thai food, thai food love, don't go there.< /review>

<Review>Portions are small. The food is inauthentic and bland. It's like the mcdonald's of thai food at triple the price just because of the location. There's way better thai food out there. This is the kind of place that gears itself for the yuppie community when they want to go slumming for ethnic food.
I went with my a Thai friend and she was offended that they misrepresented her culture like this.
This is the kind of place that so-so looking white girls tell guys they like as a social cue that they're money grubbers. Which, by the way, was the clientele we saw in there.</Review>< pics>

Recommend the Drunken Noodles, very spicy (Thai spicy will down out some of the nice char flavor) and doctor it up with a drizzle of pik nam som (chilli vinegar sauce) from the caddy.<//text>

My favorite thai restaurant.  Always a long line for lunch, but worth it.  Drunken noodle and barbecue chicken is the best.  I gave 4 stars due to the female server.< /text>

<user_id>105895611862354145147<//user_id><Text>If you're on the Westside and don't want to drive over to Thai Town, this is a good Thai spot to go to. I always go for the lunch special. For $10, I got the combo #1 (chicken pad thai, chicken satay and a couple veggie rolls). This is great value and the taste definitely backs it up! Sprinkled some lime over the pad thai and it was delicious. The portion was very generous for a "lunch special" too.

If you're a fan of spicy, I'd suggest asking for the chili sauce to add a kick! We also got an order of the Tom Khah (coconut soup) and I was delighted by how rich the broth was. It wasn't too creamy either which was fantastic. A tad spicy but definitely tolerable.It made for a great pairing with the pad thai. Also, a lot of people complain about the parking. There is literally SO many spaces if you just park in the lot behind the store or in front of the Staples area. People can't expect to park directly in front of every store!! Get walking people!<//Text>< Pictures>

This would be the best Thai food I've had in LA so far. It's still not close to say, Mali in Atlanta, Bangkok or Thai Bistro in Michigan or Pongsri in NY.< /review>

It seems to be managed systematically using IT technology. The essential food is of high quality and quantity, and it can not be served by extension of home cooking. It seems that CA also visits often. It is in the place where the restaurant gathers immediately from the hotel town around the airport. Try it.

(Original)
LAX 空港付近に泊まる際にたまに寄る店ですが、いつもお客さんで一杯の店です。IT 技術を使ってシステマチックに経営されてるみたいです。肝心のお料理は、質および量ともにハイレベルで、家庭料理の延長では出せない味。CA さんも良く訪れるそうです。空港周辺のホテル街から直ぐのレストランが集まる場所にあります。お試しあれ。< /text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) After playing in Las Vegas for a few days, I arrived in LA right away, and I accidentally found a restaurant near my accommodation. The taste and service are all very good
The price also felt very cheap compared to Las Vegas.

라스베이거스에서 몇일 놀다가 LA에 바로 도착하고 묵는 숙소가까운데로 식당찾아 나섰다가 우연히 발견한곳. 맛, 서비스 모두 아주 훌륭하고
가격 또한 라스베가스에 비하면 매우 저렴하게 느껴졌다.<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I went there considering the reviews.
It's a good Thai but nothing exceptional, the Thai pad is ok. To try without making a canteen. Be careful in the evening .. it's full and you have to write his name on the outside sheet as a waiting list!

J'y suis allée aux vu des commentaires.
C'est un bon thaï mais rien d'exceptionnel, le pad Thai est correct. À essayer sans en faire une cantine. Attention le soir .. c'est plein et il faut inscrire son nom sur feuille a l'extérieur comme liste d'attente !</Text>< response>
