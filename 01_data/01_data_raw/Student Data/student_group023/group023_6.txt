Customer service is great and it was really fast to get my paperwork completed. If you know you're getting cars with potential issues, you shouldn't be surprised by what you get.

Only 4 stars because waiting for your vehicle to arrive takes a really long time. It would also be nice if the windshield wasn't so dirty on runners.< /Text>

I have been purchasing vehicles from Capital city auto auction for a few years. I’m a local wholesaler. This is by far the worst auto auction in my area today they said I bid a 975.00 dollar on somehow magically when there website came up I won the car at 1875.00 no it was not my error I have been in this business for 15 years I will admit when I make a mistake so they make me pay a 400.00 fee and the car I do get had lien sale paperwork this paperwork is a nightmare to process with dmv I told them they didn’t disclose this at the auction I didn’t want the car guess what They said we don’t disclose that. If there is a title issue with a car every auction has to disclose this I’m going to contact idac I’m going to call my occupational licensing unit and I can’t wait until these guys have to go to wholesale only auctions because if they keep with Albert and Valinda and there policy’s  in no time flat there going to be gone.</Text>

This place is the best auto auction I’ve seen. The reason is simple - all the vehicles are donated. Who donates their old cars?  Wealthier people tend to be the ones who donate their cars, and wealthier people tend to take better care of their cars because they can afford to maintain them and get them fixed properly right when they have trouble. Poorer people tend to wait on maintenance because they can barely afford to, oftentimes they try to fix their own vehicles or trust friends or otherwise do things that wear cars out faster.
There is a distinct difference in a car that was donated as opposed to wrecked, stolen, or who knows how a non-donated car finds itself at an auto-auction, but I can tell you that there is a difference and you can feel it. There is a sense of bad juju you can feel in a car that was towed, wrecked, or recovered stolen. At Capital City Auto Auction, all the cars were donated. Think about that for a minute. It makes a difference. I’ve bought 7 cars and an RV so far and every single one of my purchases turned out well so far.<//Text>

The damage was not something I noticed in the pictures, and it certainly was not disclosed anywhere in the disclaimers, or notes.
UPDATE. Added fourth star. DMV process was what they said it would be.
It's going to work out. Very worth Buying with this team.< /Text>

As you know we have experienced exponential growth that, even before the Pandemic, led to challenges in staffing, vehicle release processes, and more!  The Pandemic has brought about an even larger supply of donated vehicles and we are trying hard to service the vehicle donors, charities, and our bidders.  There are no “shady things” going on and if you feel there are, PLEASE bring it to the attention of a member of management, whom you know on a first-name basis.  We describe and image each vehicle so you and all of our bidders can make an informed purchasing decision.  Although the DMV has instructed us to remove all plates, we ensure each plate is imaged before removal so buyers can research costs through the DMV’s online portal.  Selling price?  That is 100% out of our control as we are an auction.  Finally, we ARE currently analyzing how we can re-open preview while addressing the still ongoing Pandemic (which is not an “excuse”), the safety of our staff and bidders, and re-configuring of our systems to address a near doubled volume than we were experiencing before the Pandemic so buyers can preview vehicles and we can reduce wait times for vehicle purchases.  Again, please reach out to management if we can assist further or clarify any of your items of concern.'}< /resp>

<Text>I purchased a vehicle here in October 2020.  The pictures clearly showed a stereo in the car but did NOT show that both air bags were missing. After I received the vehicle I found that the stereo and airbags were both missing. When I called about the stereo I was told they would get back in touch about it. I sent them the photos that clearly showed the stereo in their auction pictures online. When they called back I was told someone must have taken the stereo and there was nothing they could do. I filed a complaint with the BBB and after that they responded willing to try and make things right. This company obviously can’t be trusted. They try to hide issues with vehicles and there is no customer service here at all. Do not believe what you see in the pictures. Inspect vehicles carefully before signing paperwork to accept the vehicle. Most pictures that they post are old and not recent pics of the vehicle from what I found out later.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

So i have very mixed feelings for this place. Overall, i would say it's good. There are a few things that just stand out and have a negative impact on ones overall satisfaction.
Capital City Auto Auction's vehicle inventory is so diverse. You'll see Just about every kind of car comes through here. From cars that you see every day,  nicer cars,  several reliable models,  some that by all means shouldn't have made it this far in time, to models that will make your head explode as you are yelling  "who the heck donates a car like that!.?"
With that being said,  several times I find myself horrified at some of the things I see. This is all just in photos, but it's pretty close to a pig farm. A car whos previous owner cared for very well... looks close to new inside (or out) until it's handled here. Mud all over the driver side carpeting and and pedals. Fresh coffee spills on dash and upholstery.  There have been photos of vehicles sitting in the middle of a rain/mud puddle just waiting for the operator to jump back in with his muddy shoes. There is clearly no regard to mind this frequent occurrence nor the respect for the cars or so to be owners. Be prepared to clean your purchases.

The COVID copout here is that they wont let you see the cars in person. Its all outdoors, I just dont see the difference in previewing the car, as it relates to contact,  as when the vehicle is picked up. So watch the pictures very closely, as they are no help whatsoever with wetting cars. Remember, they are not being washed! Aside from the enormous waste of water,  they are just trying to make it look better so what you see is not necessarily what you get. Three purchases only to find after purchase that they were highly oxidised. Of course they still wet the car if the windows are inoperable and down. Cats probably live in those cars, but all the dust and mud from the forklifts and tow trucks buzzing by will mask that though. Buy some gravel!
The fees are another concern. Like a smog cert fee. Sounds valid, it’s smogged, right?  The auction DOES NOT PAY FOR OR SMOG the vehicle, so this is a corrupt and easy way to nickel and dime for nothing. It’s dishonest and condemnable.

When you try to get more info on a car, you'll be pacified with a generic response along the lines of "we don't diagnose vehicles" which I would believe if they weren't throwing them on a lift.
Oh my first taste of recklessness came on a forklift. My heart just about stopped. The car I had purchased was low or out of gas, so instead of bringing a gas can over,  it was lifted with a forklift from the front (very much the wrong way), causing damage to the front end control arms and the fresh metal underneath was from its weight sitting improperly on the forks, but i made no effort to bring this up in any way knowing what a response would consist of.

The following are also junk/gouge fees- the Internet fee, though it's the one and only option for now, and the kick ya in the teeth credit card fee! They will not take more than $500 in cash, but will allow the rest of it on a credit card/debit card for a nominal fee at 3%.
If you've read this far,  know that they are as is, but there is a chance that after you buy a car, something happens to it and in my personal experience had an additional problem that was marked on the windshield before i picked it up (i could smell the fresh ink) but after an encounter With forky the lift/driver. A new problem not listed listed anywhere prior and it was not on there when they took  photos but somehow diagnosed it auction day, the best was having the serpentine belt shredded. Yup, they got yard games.
I would, however, go for another car here if the right one comes along, but i can candidly say that I AM SCARED TO. Same risk in an end of life car in most cars, but good ones are totally available. It can definitely be a good experience with favorable outcomes.
3 stars solid.</Text>

I bought a car last week. I did a proxy bid and won. They added $200 to the proxy bid. Lame. The best part is the car was last registered in 2016. No way of knowing that. Picture of the plate was blurry and no preview funny how all the other auction have previews now. So I have to paid $778 dollars for back reg. and get it smogged which by law they are only supposed to auction smogged cars only to the public. look it up. Done with this place......</review>

Not everything that is in the picture is there when you purchase the car, not will they give you a refund even if you are a repeat customer. Manager basically tells you to get lost.

<Review>Rude and disorganized, lost my keys to a car I bought costing me an extra $300 and didn’t help cover the extra cost at all. Continuously receiving cars with misdiagnosis.  89 Nissan Truck with “no cat” was really a blown spark plug.  04 Dodge Durango with “blown head gasket” is really a broken/Unprogrammed key with security system problems.  98 Jeep Grand Cherokee that “needs alternator/battery” was actually completely missing the power steering pulley and. The serpentine belt wasn’t on so the battery, while still good,obviously couldn’t charge...  I don’t recommend getting a car from here unless you are ready for a mystery egg of a car.</Review><Date>1603951627895<//Date><GmapID>0x809ae819b62b8a11:0x6630444b319c6c23</GmapID>< UserId.>

<text>Prices are insane, especially with not being able to preview the vehicles at all. I know they don't make people bid, but the reserves on most cars is far in excess of their value.  The website is a lot better than it used to be but with the prices I'm seeing, not being able to preview the vehicles at all and over 90 minutes to pick up a car (I've seen comments of 4+ HOURS) this just isnt a place to get a deal anymore.</text>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><name>Shahzab Shah< /name><pictures>None</pictures><text>Awful experience dealing with management at this company. They fail to admit fault unless you're willing to stand your ground and then they'll terminate your account. I had an initial bad experience with when I first started using them due them not reporting issues with a vehicle in their condition reports. Eventually they accepted 100% fault in the matter and I continued to do business with them and purchased other vehicles and attended numerous pre-view days for auctions within the last two years. This last week the car I was bidding on had a similar issue as stated in the first circumstance. I had bid on the car however when I took a closer look at the pictures of the vehicle you could see the stability control system light was illuminated at the time staff were inspecting the vehicle, which can indicate an issue with the system. However, this was not mentioned in the condition report and was not visible upon inspection (could be reset and come back later). When I brought this up to management I was immediately told there was no error on their end even if the pictures clearly showed the light was on because was no longer on anymore. Had this been stated on the condition report I would have passed on the car and looked to bid on others. After some back and forth management they ended up removing the car from my account, returning my deposit, and closing my account entirely stating issues have come up in the past (referencing the first incident), even though the previous issue they took 100% accountability (have screenshots of the message of them taking 100% responsibility). Basically standing up to management about errors on their end causes you to lose your account even if those errors are 100% their fault. I find this to be an inappropriate action to take against a returning customer whose never made an error on his/her end.</text>< date>

This is a good business idea and there are some very nice employees that work there. The problem is with the organization and work  flow.  The fees and charges added more than 60 percent to the out the door costs to my purchase.  Read the fee schedule carefully because the price of your purchase goes up quite a bit. The biggest issue I had was the total disregard for the safety of the customers.  They have a sign telling customers the wait could be more than 90 minutes. You bet it will be more! I waited more than 3 hours. The line is in the sun and the temperature was over 100 degrees.  After you wait in line to complete the DMV transfer you need to wait outside for them to bring you vehicle to the front. That was another 90 minutes, but at least you can wait on the shade.If you decide that you can't endure this process they charge a $400 abandonment fee. The company literally served a customer waiting  next us with a small claims lawsuit to collect an abandonment fee. I was shocked.This company could make so much more money if they treated customers with respect.They will do fine while everyone has some extra cash. They dont care if you come back or not right now.I learned my lesson. Sometimes a bargain isn't a bargain. I wont go back until I hear things have changed.

Have you considered an appointment system?

Update 8-27-2020. I heard that changes were made and tried CCAA again. I was very impressed with the improvements with easy ups for shade, misters, and more staff for quick check out. Nice work guys.</Text>

I was able to register online for an account within about a day and a half maybe two days total and even wake up WAY late (because I work graveyards) at 1pm today and still be able to log in and place a bid on their live public auto auction on one of the last maybe 10 cars left still avalible for auction and WIN! Purchasing my Toyota Corolla for only $250 ($385 after taxes and auction fees) and actually go in TODAY and pay in cash and drive my car home! I'm very thrilled and would have given 5 stars except a little better explanation as to what my next steps are in making this car mine would have been helpful! I'm not too sure if I need to wait for the title in my name and then go into the CA DMV? Or if I need to go in immediately? Anyways, thank you so much!<//Text>

<review>Had an off experience with my first vehicle purchase today. I been visiting the auctions for the last few weeks after finding them online. Everyone here is nice and truly friendly. That’s why I’m giving two stars instead of one.

That being said I purchased a car with the condition report stating no issues however later it could be seen in the pictures of the vehicle there was a visible check engine light. They are pretty good about telling you of obvious issues like this but this time it was missed. I called them about the issue and was told by a nice lady someone would call me and talk to me about it. I eventually was told that even though they missed it I was going to have to buy the car or pay a fee of $300 to opt out. I don’t think that’s fair even though the gentleman seemed nice. I would have hoped they worked with me more on this since they were faults on both sides but I am now forced to pay one way or another.<//review><name>ShahGAutos<//name><Rate>1< /Rate><Time>1541528579296< /Time><Gmap_id>0x809ae819b62b8a11:0x6630444b319c6c23</Gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1531804634552, 'text': 'ShahGAutos, you are 100% correct.

They auction off the cars that suck, ones with the most mechanical problems and damage.  The Cars that are nice and Decent or in the most demand they sell them at a Set price. Went to look at a few cars the day before the auction, at the end of the day went online to check on same cars I view and they were no longer for auction... they were for sale. They keep record of what cars people come view/check out. It’s all game.< /Text>

Worst car auction Ive ever been to.   For anyone whos never been, the price you bid is not the price you pay.  Theres a convenience fee... what in the ... is that?  And an internet fee .. but wait .. you can only bid using the internet.  They dont have live bidding.  And then theres a buyers fee based on the amount of your bid.  So your total price could easily be double your bid price.  But  you should know this going in and bid accordingly.  Its just the owners financial strategy to realize maximum return on the sales with minimum return to the charities that are supposed to benefit from the donated cars.

The real big problem here is just like everyone else here said (who wasnt obviously an employee or family member of CCCA), runs and drives to them doesnt mean you can drive it off the lot.  Ive never bought a car there that i could drive home without having to stop for overheating, bad fuel pump or any myriad of other problems.  Several times i had to tow a runs and drives car out of there.

Refunds.  Youve got to be kidding.  I purchased a mercedes there that was supposed to run and drive.  Sure.  If it had a battery.  They didnt disclose it needed a battery.  So i had to come back the next day with a battery.  That worked for about two blocks.  It needed an alternator.  The check engine light was on none of which was disclosed.   And it had 3 absolutely flat tires  which wasnt disclosed or shown in the photos.  Initially when i went to pick it up the lot boy  asked where my tow truck or trailer was because it couldnt be driven and he couldnt start it.  This was on a runs and drives car, mind you.  Of course those helpful people at capital city wouldnt do a thing about it.  So that was a total loss.

I am no longer registered there.  My account is permanently suspended.  Why?  Because i couldnt find my drivers license.  Either it was stolen or i lost it.  But i had my old license which worked just fine until one day i got the clerk from hell.  She had no business dealing with the public.  I had just picked up a car the day before and was back to get the other one.  This clerk told me i couldnt pay for the car unless i had a valid license in my hand.  I explained to her that i had applied to dmv for a replacement but she said that wasnt good enough and reprimanded the other girls in the office for letting me buy all those cars previously.  It didnt matter that i wasnt driving the car.  That wasnt the issue.  It was their internal rule.

The office mgr said dmv should have given me a temporary with my picture on it.  I told her i got it online.
I was just waiting for it to come in the mail.  But you only have two days to pick up the cars you buy.  So thinking dmv may be doing things differently than what i remembered i went down there for 6 hours waiting... only to be given a temporary with no picture.  Again i phoned the capital city office and was told that wasnt good enough.  I couldnt buy the car.  I could pay a $300 restocking fee or have my account permanently suspended.

It does no good to try to go to someone in authority with reasoning.  I tried several times to talk to the general mgr who never once gave me the courtesy of speaking to me or responding to my emails. The office mgr just told me he agreed with her.   I was told by another dealer in the office at the same time that he knew the owners well and it would do no good talking to him either.

I was a car dealer for many years, traveling all over the States buying at car auctions and have never been treated with such disrespect and double talk in my life.

And btw forget about buying any of the Harleys or any cool motorcycle there.  One of the lot boys has that all tied up.  I met him in the parking lot loading up two of the Harleys he had purchased at the auction and was coming back for more.  He said he has a garage of them at his house he bought at the auction.  I got the feeling he described them as not running or needing work in order to win the bid.  Funny at regular auctions employees are not allowed to bid or get preferential treatment.< /review>
<Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1560272655492, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback Ms. Harryman!  Input our customers is greatly appreciated!  If we may, we’d like to clarify a few of the items noted in your recent review…\n\n1.  You are absolutely correct that the price you bid is not the final price you pay.  As with nearly all Auto Auctions, there are additional fees charged to the buyer for each vehicle purchased.  These fees and all auction terms and conditions are sent to every buyer when they register and are clearly posted on our website, and agreed to by every buyer prior to bidding each time they log in.\n2.  Our internet convenience fee is a small fee that is charged to recover a portion of the cost of our online bidding platform so our valued customers can bid from the convenience of their home or office.  Feedback from our bidders has been overwhelmingly in support of this fee for the convenience.\n3.  Since the Internet Convenience Fee and the Doc Fee are fixed fees, that does result in a higher percentage of the sales price if you are buying vehicles from $200 - $300 which has been the case on each of the numerous vehicle you purchased.  The majority of our vehicles sell for approximately $1,000.  For those vehicles, the fees result in a much lower percentage relative to the final bid amount.\n4.  To protect our buyers and their purchases, we do absolutely required a valid government issued ID to register, pay for and pick up a vehicle.  Since our auctions are held online, this is extremely important to most of our buyers and CA DMV which receives reports on vehicles purchased and who purchased them.\n5.  Employees at CCAA are allowed to purchased one vehicle per year so long as it is to be used for personal use only.  They must register and bid alongside every other registered buyer.  No exceptions!  For clarification, NO employee at CCAA has every purchase a Harley Davidson since the day we opened.\n\nThank you again for your feedback!\n\n-Capital City Auto Auction Team'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>BUYERS BEWARE I registered via mobile phone, I got in to bid for a Toyota Highlander. I clicked on the Highlander placed a bid and it said I won. I get an invoice for a Saturn with no reverse. I immediately send an email that there was a mistake, no response. When I get off work I call and explain what happened. The rep says for future I should not bid using my mobile it is not recommended. And she has to tell me all sales are final. I have two options pay the $365 and pick up the car or pay $400 to relist.  Well great maybe put a note on your website so people do not make this mistake. Then I asked to talk to a manager I tell her the rep said people shouldn't  use their moblie phones and she says well it worked because you placed a hard bid. So now she trys to explain to me how the process works and their were 4 cars between the Highlander and Saturn and I did not bid on the Highlander. Not sure what her point was since I know I clicked on a Highlander. Beware buyers don't use your mobile phone like the nice rep said and the lying manager now denies is a problem. I am the 2nd person I personally know that has had this problem of bidding on a car online and getting something else. I guess it's more of a grab bag than an auction...if you are down with that have at it and good luck! Also I have a Saturn for sale, any takers on a car that has no reverse and is not even made anymore? At the very least this company needs to place a banner on their website or in the registration email that states bidding does not work on mobile phones do not use your mobile phone. It is shady to have a known problem and a policy of all sales final. Sounds like a scam.

Update 6-3-19: finally got a chance to see the car I did not bid on. It did say run and drives so I was hoping I could at least flip this Saturn. Nope does not run, so I jump it and I do get  it to start only to see it has a coolant light on so we add water as we are adding it we see a very strange film coming to surface. Well turns out the problem is that someone filled the radiator with oil! Of course this begs the quesion lets check  the oil....pull the dip stick and its bone dry. This car was owned by a complete idi5or. Pretty sure they put the oil in the radiator. Added bonus all the locks are all busted. This is complete garbage.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

{'time': 1531319729354, 'text': "Thank you for your feedback.  We always appreciate hearing from our customers so we can work on the continual improvement of CCAA.  Addressing your comments:  1.  As for the web pages we use for our auction process, we agree with you.  The landing pages and software used to allow our buyers to bid live online leave a lot to be desired.  Please know that we are working diligently to find a better design or a different software partner that offers a better user experience.  2.  Credit Card Payments; As you know, the vehicles we sell are all charity-donated vehicles.  We've tried to keep costs at a minimum so the awesome charities we represent receive as much of the auction proceeds as possible.  This includes limiting the credit card charges to only the initial deposit since credit card companies charge us approx. 3% of the charged amount.  We will continue to look into all of our options that work best for CCAA, the charities, AND the buyers.  3.  Inspection.  In-Person vehicle preview is done on the Monday just before each auction.  On that day we allow vehicle inspections from 8:30AM - 4:30PM.  There aren't inspection prior to that since cars are not lined up in the sale area yet and it would be difficult for buyers to locate them in the yard.  If, however, you've had a poor experience with inspections, please feel free to send me a note at ken@capitalcityautoauction.com.  Thank you again for your business and your feedback!"}</response>
<Review>You can still get a good deal occasionally.  My biggest complaints are the website, which would be considered terrible in the 90's.  It looks like a geocities or frontpage throwback.  The second is the lack of debit/credit card payment.  These people still use freaking money orders!  It's time to join the rest of us here in 2018.  This is a time capsule business stuck in 1988.  The third is they need to make it easier to inspect the vehicles.  Come on I'm not trying to inspect your momma, these are cars,  relax.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< user>

Worst experience with them today, I bidded on two cars, 1 said runs and drives salvage title, so I pick it up my mother in law drives it and tells her there’s no battery in it, we gotta take this one out, so she’s driving down to go get gas near Folsom blvd the car is overheating and broke down, $385 paid for a car to be broken down, didn’t state, overheats, or any mechanic problems all it said was runs and drives salvage title.... now I lost that car parked on side of the road ... while she calls me to tell me she broke down I’m waiting about 1 hour for them to get my 2004 Volvo... says runs and drives, leaks oil, check engine light on. I bidded $385 so the gate guy tells me sorry we can’t get it to start, you have to tell them give you a refund. I go inside and they say all sales final...I was beyond mad, for one my kids are in the car waiting for almost longer then a hour for a car that stated runs and drives.... then they say the starter went out we can park it in the Parking lot for you to pick up later. Really you expect me to drive all the way back with a tow truck... after I bidded on this car because it says runs and drives.. so there was another $385 they wouldn’t give me back. I will no longer do business with them. I lost $770 in a day. Just for two pink slips andfor the Volvo probally to be relisted as not running since they parked it in their own parking lot... I don’t understand why they couldn’t refund me since I paid for runs and drives cars, it didn’t state on the Honda Accord (no battery) or (overheats) if I knew that I wouldn’t of bidded on it at all, the Volvo I was fine with it having a oil leak that could be fixed easily, but for it overall not to start in there yard... clearly stated runs and drives, so they get to keep my money cause all sales are final. Worst customer service ever ....< /Text>

{'time': 1521848573371, 'text': 'Nancy-\n\nThank you for the feedback.  We try diligently to ensure that all of the vehicles listed for sale on our auctions are listed with accurate information.  In this case, you are 100% right that, although the description of the vehicle showed it as a Front Wheel Drive (FWD), the listing TITLE showed it as an All Wheel Drive (AWD).  This was entirely our fault and as such, we were willing work with you and refund your money 100%, which we did.  Your credit card deposit has been refunded and your refund check has been processed and is ready to be picked up.   Thank you again for your feedback.  We use any feedback received to adjust our processes, procedures, and bidding platform to help make the car bidding and buying experience better for all of our current and future customers.'}</resp>

First and last time that I visit this place. Bad service, bad attitude. The woman that was serving us had a bad actitude serving the customer, and this is not the first time that I have come to this place. She's not respectful and not professional.<//review>

<text>This place use to be good but lately it's been horrible.  A few weeks ago the guy making my sandwich pulled it out of the toaster and then drops on the floor.. he salvaged half of it and tried to give me half of it and make another half.  Today same guy drops the knife that they slice the bread with and he left on the floor. I really  doubt he will wash it.
The air conditioning system is always turned off on hot days. I've been in there when its 90 degrees outside and feels the same if not hotter in there. I asked me of the workers why it's was so hot in there and he said the owner was wouldn't let them turn it on.
The only reason I keep going back is because it's close to my work. This time I highly doubt I will go back<//text>< date>

Why is 0 stars not an option? The Supposed Manager Ana was Beyond unprofessional atthus location, refusing to take my payment for my 12 yr old daughter's order, simply because I changed the order. She began making the order for the next customer in line, while we were standing waiting to pay. She told me you can cancel the whole order if you dont want to wait and continued to help the next customer, when there was another employee willing and able to take the next customer.i will be following up with a complaint to the owner

<Review>First of all lettuce is stale, second - for a foot long sub they've put so less cheddar cheese which is not even enough for a 6ince sub. They literally sprinkle like it's some kind of seasoning and charged extra for cheese. I ended up paying around $15 for a foot long VEGGIE delight with egg and avocado. I always order same item from any subway restaurant but it was never more than 10 bucks. I usually ignore stuff like this and don't have patience to write a lengthy review, but this is exception because they're knowingly ripping off. #subway<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fcd040078f9af:0xe5c57517ec1d81e6<//gmapID></record>

They often are closed in the morning, despite they are declaring they are to be open at 9am.
Another irritating thing is that despite they have menu they always asking about all ingredients.</text>

Great hole in the wall. Never would have noticed it if we hadn't circled the building. Tapioca express definitely doesnt since it's building is a lot more noticeable. Plus the subways and flower shop are on the other side of the building, you wouldn't notice their stores unless you were looking for them.

Food was great and manageable.</text>

One of the worst. They keep the dressings inside instead of keeping them outside like in many subways. New customers might not know what all options they have. Been there 3 times, not at least 1 time Italian herbs & cheese bread is available. Not very friendly people working there. Restroom will be unlocked if and only if you are customer & you asked for it. It is too small in terms of space. If I could give negative rating out of 5 I would have given.</review>

I stopped coming here since i started working at an eriks deli, and well today my kid wanted subway and this is the closest one to me so i went and when i got rung up i had a 100 bill and they said they didnt accept 100 bills so i was like ok letme get change at the next store and shes like ill accept it once, it says up there that we dont accept 100 bills and i told her im sorry i cabt see i dont have my glasses and she looked at my daughter like saying she can do it for u and thats when i told her to give me my money back and she rung the money and say why i told her just give me money back and refused to and kept asking why, so i told her you're being rude and she gave me a mean look rolled her eyes the whole time and check this out this is the manager! My manager would have never let a customer leave like that ever! Called the police they couldnt do anything just gave me my sandwhiches,chips, but forgot the drinks! So if anyone knows how i can contact the owner I'd really appreciate it. This is not ok for a MANAGER to treat their customers like this.<//review><rating>1< /rating><response>None<//response><userid>111068041639079289611</userid><pics>None< /pics><Time>1552966595417</Time></record>

Not the best experience I’ve had at this subway during my first visit. I went half an hour before closing and they had already put everything away ready to close. Didn’t have choice of bread for me. Had to take whatever they had available. Upon asking for avocado, I was told there isn’t any available but I am assuming they didn’t want to cut open a new one for me so simply refused. Only person working didn’t look pleased to help. Understand that everyone wants to go home after long working hours but I would expect to get what I want if I’ve come in during your business hours. I would avoid going to this particular subway in future for sure.<//review>

<review>Don't even deserves one star. First time I had problems with this place , I got a phone call from them saying my lock had been broken off and I needed to come put a new one on and check to make sure nothing was taken! I said, NO..u will be replacing my lock, what and I paying insurance for and paying u to keep my stuff safe? SMH
So then comes moving day, I had half my couch in there cause my apartment at the time didn't have enough room for the huge sectional we had. Any how, I pulled it out and baby termites we're eating up my couch. A $2,000 couch from Mor furniture and it's damaged. The manager tells me the insurance covers it and we sent all the paperwork and photos to them ....COME TO FIND OUT ...the insurance DOES NOT COVER MOTHS, INSECTS, RODENTS, VERMIN, MOLD AND MILDEW!
So pissed ...this place is a joke. They need to be shut down and sprayed for bugs. DO NOT RENT HERE ..IM SAVINGS U A HEADACHE AND TROUBLE BELIEVE ME!</review><response>{'time': 1536529923878, 'text': 'Gloria,   We can assure you that we do not find this type of behavior acceptable, and we would like to address the situation you have described.

Nice clean place. The elevator was finally working again...that took a while! And sometimes people don't close the doors of the elevator so other people their can go up or down.  Also just a little scary regarding the area they are in and not very convenient parking...But, all in all, clean & secure.<//text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I have been renting a 10X25 unit in this facility for 7, yes seven, years now.  When the previous owners were here my unit was broken into and it was handled very professionally and their insurance company paid me promptly and fairly. Since SecurCare took it over, the employees are different every time I go in there. Apparently there is more than one manager there, because I have talked to more than one guy who told me he was the manager. I have received a 15-20% raise in rent every year and they jacked up the amount they were charging for late fees. The rates they are currently charging for new customers for my size unit is $153, which is $55 less than I am currently paying. Their web rate for my size unit is $139, so $69 LESS than someone who has been a customer for 7 years! Loyalty means nothing to a company when current renters are paying higher prices than the new people- especially that much higher! I haven't given notice yet but when I am ready to, you can bet I will be taking my $208 elsewhere. Two different places were not only cheaper, they will let me use their truck for free to move my stuff!< /review><user_id>109484329185241537146<//user_id>< gmapID>

<userid>116333667612032311174< /userid><Text>Be very very careful!!  They just changed new owners and, as expected, they are totally maximizing revenue - at the expense of service.  When we started a year ago, it was $57.  That same unit is now $88.  Plus, on the service side, they cancelled the autopay I had set up with them, and then sent me a $15 notice to lien and sell my items, with a late fee.  I called them and they said they don't waive late fees or negotiate on liens ever.  Of course, I paid them what they asked ($81 on my $57 unit).  Now is NOT the time to get in.  Wait for them to shake out the old customers and finalize their prices, hours, staff.  Then, see the reviews AFTER  it all shakes out.  All the storage places do this every couple of years.  It's just time for this one.  Sadly, because they used to be a great deal.< /Text>< Pics>

Worst customer service I've ever dealt with the staff is incompetent I've called the district manager I've called corporate office I've got no return phone calls they locked me out of my unit before the payment was even due. That was after I just finished paying $500 to save the damn unit. I decided to change units paid for the both of them was told that they would put a light up immediately no one ever took action no one ever made an attempt to put a light up I even took I lock off and told them to contact me when the light was fixed..now locked out of both and talking to attorney<//Review>

<text>Phenomenal customer service. All interactions with staff have been pleasant, helpful and exactly what you'd want. Also, the online bill pay feature is extremely convenient, so you don't have to worry about going down to the space once a month like you do with other places in Fresno.< /text><gmap_id>0x80945e294cd9b52d:0x9bc973dfed4a55b9<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

<Review>Not a secure place to store your things. I stored my car there and after a couple of days I came back to check on it the custom cover that was on my car was gone. The guy told me there were no cameras in the back to cover where the car was parked. When I asked the lady she said there was cameras that had viewing in the back where cars were parked. This place has homeless people living out of their storage facilities. In the front gate there is a walk in gate that is not secure anyone can open it and get in. Once you are in you can open the big gate having access to any storage locker you want.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<resp>None</resp><Review>I would have given 5 Stars but I was really upset being Darrel's had give me a cheaper quote and also Extra Space Storage's Employee both told me different things. We were told over the phone $24 for a 10x10 and that was $22 cheaper than Darrel's. We arrive and the Gentleman that helped us was friendly and nice. There was 2 females along with him which seemed to be employees. All 3 took us to the 3rd floor to show us the unit. He then asked if I was going to be storing expensive items because they have insurance and each coverage varies. That's the catch because Darrel's price is locked in for $5000 automatic insurance. The gentleman asked me how much my valuables were and mention the $3000 coverage for $13 a month not bad at all. Well he said something one of the 2 girls didn't like because she made a rude come I didn't catch but my friend did. We proceeded down to the office where I realized left my wallet at home which is 1 mile or so away. I rushed being it was my Moving day and plans have changed and came right back. When we got into the car my friend mention the Girl was training the other girl and said "You don't say if you WANT the insurance. . .they HAVE To get the insurance." At this point it's 5 o'clock I'm rushing back and the gentleman is gone and it's just the 2 female employees. When setting me up to the account she quoted us a higher amount and mentioned to me I had to get the $5,000 coverage and not the $3,000 coverage it become frustrating at that point. I went through with the process and had no choice being I had to be moving out. There is homeless people hanging around all the time and it doesn't feel 100% safe.<//Review>< GmapID>

Management refused in person $30 cash payment for second months rent and cancelled rental agreement. I was still within my first month. Didn't bother to argue managements unsatisfactory excuse. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT RENTING THIS STORAGE FACILITY. The only courtesy I received from this place of business, is when I was moving out. Thanks anyway.< /Review>

Everything was fine until I was moving out. I had 4 or 5 empty bins and a box of clothes. I asked if I could  throw something's into their dumpster. I was told no. I explained how I was stuck in Fresno without gas money, but didn't want to lose my things. Was even crying I was so stressed out. I left the bins and diaper box with clothes in the unit. I had informed them I was closing the unit. So I took my lock and left. Guess I should have left it in the hallway. Then I received an email charging me for 2 weeks.
Update: Even after contacting them I recieved a bill again now with a late fee. really.  Whatever happened to compassion and helping your fellowman. Customer Service is not about the customer anymore. Its all about reel them in and then suck all the money you can out of them.<//Text>

dont even know where to begin so I wont just dont start any type of business(with this facility) all bad really needs security cameras and a new way of getting from floor to floor its ridiculous the lift is always broken down or someone leaves it up from another floor and you are trapped on a floor away from your car with all your belongings and no one ever ever ever comes up to help you or simply puts the lift doors down so you can get down its just flat out horrible and your belongings arent safe either<//Text>

Horrible.   Nightmare experience,  literally.   We reserved online.   Made administrative fee, insurance,  and lock payment before signing lease by phone.
Were told we could access and move in after hours and were given incorrect hate code.  Waited for someone to come out, and went in only to discover a homeless camp full of tweakers, and got stuck inside with no gate code to get us out!
Called for refund and was denied.
I'm now out $48 for fees I never even used, signed lease for, and never even got a lock!
Beware!!!!  Rip off, shady, unsafe, and units have chicken wire as ROOF.</review>

<text>I used to think highly of this place but after they changed owners I'm disappointed I never received the notice about the auto pay cancel mainly probably cause of my mail my apartments mailboxes got broken into so they got the letter sent back to them so I had to pay a larger fee then the guy on the phone said did I want to sent this card up for auto pay cause I was explaining to him I have a chronic illness not easy for me to get around all the time he said it was going to be the 1 time charge fee then set up for auto payments next month didn't come out I told them I set it up auto payment last time they said can't do it over the phone I have to come in and fill in a form and sure enough I got sick again but I'm out of the hospital and I'll toughen it up to sign the papers tomorrow I'd go today but closed< /text>< Pics>

<text>I went dress shopping at 4 other places, and even bought another dress at a different store, before buying my actual wedding dress here. I had such a great experience dress shopping here. The Bridal and Tuxedo Galleria has a seemingly endless amount of styles to try. My consultant was Kayla, and she was absolutely fantastic. She communicated with me prior to the appointment for my vision so she could pull styles ahead of my appointment. Additionally, during the appointment, Kayla was extremely attentive and really listened to what I did and didn't like about each dress. With every dress I tried, she paid attention to my feedback and presented me with better options with each next dress. She was also very cognizant of my budget, which is an understated quality - other places I went to kept trying to push dresses on me that were out of my price range or not in the style I wanted. She is by far the best dress shopping consultant I've had during this experience. The store also has a fabulous dressing room area and viewing/seating area for guests. I couldn't recommend the Bridal and Tuxedo Galleria enough to future brides out there!<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The staff here are incredibly kind and helpful. The alterations department did an outstanding job making my vision for my dress come true. The fittings were easy and quick, and the store is very transparent with pricing and services. My original consultant was Gloria and she was great. I am so happy that I found my perfect dress at Bridal & Tuxedo Galleria!<//Text>

You know the feeling you want when you “say yes to the dress,” you’re not going to get it here. They will say anything to get you to buy the dress and, in the end, will not provide the quality services they promise.

Because I had a baby between the time I purchased the dress and the time I had it altered, the dress fit slightly differently than when I originally bought it. It still fit me, just had a few imperfections that needed to be altered but instead of offering solutions,, the consultants chose to make comments about my body - “that’s not the dress, that’s you,” “that’s because of your swelling,” “nothing we can do about that.”

They made the entire dress buying situation awkward and uncomfortable. I hated going back to my appointments but by the time I figured that out, I had already paid for the alterations and they won’t give refunds. Even when I brought all of this to their attention, they said they would do their best to remedy the situation but it was truly all talk. They’ll keep your money and pretend they tried to help but I promise you, they won’t.<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1625263280506, 'text': 'Hi Daetona Lawrence, now Daetona Mascorro. We wish we could "rate" our customers too, but Google won\'t allow us to do that. We as a team tried everything possible to make you happy. Every request you had we did our absolute best. You insulted our staff calling them "stupid". You and your mother would say snotty remarks that were extremally rude to the seamstress and consultant helping you knowing that we can hear you, but we had to ignore your hostile tone. You would curse throughout our boutique at each appointment to the point our consultant was afraid to help you because she didn\'t want to get cursed at for only doing her job. You were extremely demanding and so rude. This store has been here for over 20 years and we have never had a bride as rude and disrespectful as you and your family. Your husband, Austin Mascorro already left us a poor review then you called and apologized and then deleted it only because we were still in the process of your alterations. We know in our hearts as the BTG team we accommodated you and your "requests/demands" more then any other bridal store ever would. The way you treated our staff, any other location would 100% say "here is your gown, you can go somewhere else" Your attempt to slander us on each social media platform just shows how rude and disrespectful of a person you are. You bought your gown March 2020 and did not start alterations till June 2021 and we expressed our alterations prices increased since your 2020 appointment (as everywhere else prices are increasing). We still honored our old prices to help you as much as possible because we knew you had just had a baby.\nYour alterations were done impeccable and your family and friends will agree with that when they see you in your dress on you wedding date.\nBest of luck.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

I HIGHLY recommend Bridal and Tuxedo Galleria!! They have beautiful dresses, a wide variety of options, great prices, and really took the time to understand my style and help me find the perfect wedding dress. Davina was amazing; so friendly, sweet, professional, and helpful. She helped me feel so comfortable through the entire process. I cannot express enough how thankful I am for Davina and how much I enjoyed the experience of shopping here!< /Text>

My experience here was uncompassionate, and I was made to feel extremely uncomfortable. My mother had flown in specifically to help me shop for my dress. Prior to her arrival, I had injured my ankle and was wearing a large brace and crutches. I was already feeling sad about this happening since my mom and I were looking forward to wedding dress shopping for so long! This was not what we planned, but we were making the most of it and keeping a positive attitude. Gloria assisted us. One of the first things she said to me was "I'm really not sure how you're going to try on fitted dresses with THAT going on" as she waved her hand at my leg. Would you say that to someone in a wheelchair or otherwise?? Completely rude. I told her that I knew how to handle it and that she needn't worry about it. She showed us some dresses she pulled based on a very quick phone call she made to me less than 24 hours before my appt. We went back to the dressing room where she told my mother "normally no one else is allowed back here to help her with the dresses but I guess I can allow it". Excuse me?? This is my mother helping me! I told my mom it was ok, I could handle it, so my mom went to look around the shop. Gloria found my mom and instructed her not to touch the dresses. She explained that m mother may point to dresses but only Gloria may handle them. Lastly, all the dresses she pulled were not what I had described. When I tried to explain this she said “Well, did you look online like I had suggested when we talked yesterday?’ Ummm no Gloria, I did not drop everything I was doing at 3pm, the day before my appointment to look online at dresses from your shop. Her tone was defensive and slightly condescending as if I was the problem because I did not look online with less than 24 hours warning and with my parents arriving from out of town. I explained I did not have time on such short notice and that other life things took precedence yesterday. I thought our phone conversation yesterday covered all those bases. I was halfway through trying on a second dress when she was in the dressing room watching me and saying “I am worried about your safety, and I’m ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE DRESSES… but of course your safely with you trying these on.” (as she stared at my brace and boot).  It was very apparent that she was clearly worried about the  dresses more than me… we left after 10 minutes of her uncompassionate demeanor. If I would have started with this shop, my heart and excitement would have been ruined for the day. Thankfully, the next couple shops were kind and accommodating and did not make me feel that the dresses or more able-bodied people were more important than my wedding dress shopping experience.<//text>

{'time': 1625081364785, 'text': "As a small business all reviews are especially important to us, and we do not take them lightly.\nAs a Senior Bridal Consultant with 15 years plus experience in the high-end retail industry I\nhave never had a bride/customer not satisfied with my service, diligence, expertise, honest\nopinion or empathy. I always strive for treating brides/customers with dignity, equality and\nrespect. Reviews from brides/customers to me and left here in Yelp, Google and Facebook\nattest to themselves.\nAt B&TG, we follow some rules and policy procedures in cases like yours when you\ncome to try on a wedding gown. Your safety and wellbeing were my/our priority at your visit.\nYou were very defensive when I said I was sorry about what had happened to you...your answer\nwas, “let's just leave it as it is”. That confirmed to me that you were not having a good day.\nRight away, I pulled the gowns I considered you would like to try on based on our phone\nconversation the day before. It is customary in the bridal industry to interview a bride prior their\nvisit to a boutique so that way, bridal consultants can use appointment time efficiently and have\nmore dresses in their brides try on lists. It was never an issue not having the time to search our\nwebsite or bring your own list of gowns. I also allowed your mom in the fitting room to help you\nwhen this is not a regular practice. I honestly did it in consideration of your physical condition.\nAt B&TG, we never ever deprive our brides or their guests of touching the gowns. Besides, who will\ngo to a bridal boutique if brides/guests cannot look, touch, try on or ask questions about dresses?\nAt our boutique, we treat every single gown with love and care and with the next bride in mind,\nbeing so conscious about the amount of money involved in the purchasing and the sacrifice that it takes to acquire a wedding gown… that is why, we are so careful and sensitive about how we handle our gowns.\nI tried my best to be helpful, caring, respectful, emphatic and communicative. I tried to understand your situation about your budget and your imminent wedding date and the fact that you did not disclosed your physical condition before attending your appointment.  In my opinion, a good attitude from the beginning of your appointment would have been a plus!. I Love my job and working for B&TG where our goal is to be exceptionally good at customer service and to make every single bride look amazingly beautiful and happy on their big day and we really have accomplished it! Good luck in your search. Gloria"}</response>

This place is incredible!! They have such an amazing selection of very reasonably priced and absolutely beautiful wedding dresses (and bridesmaids dresses, tuxes, veils, and accessories)! I loved that I was able to view most of the dresses online beforehand, especially during Covid. Davina was incredible and able to answer any question I threw at her. All the staff I encountered were so friendly and knowledgeable! The fact that they also do in-house alterations makes the process that much easier and so convenient. I would highly recommend checking this place out!! Loved my experience and I'm absolutely in love with my dress!< /Review>

<text>Experience at first was good, but when my daughter decided to pick up her dress, the tear they had promised to fix was done very shoddy and they refused to fix it correctly. It seemed they literally used a hot glue gun to fix the hole on the dress. Unfortunately my daughter had signed off on the terrible repair because her wedding was only a couple of weeks away, and was anxious enough, but when my wife went back to ask for the repair to be done correctly they told her it was signed off on and that was it. My wife was adamant about getting it fixed correctly, but it seems the “owner” of the establishment was even more adamant of not doing the repair and got in her face and screamed at her. Luckily I was not there, because I would have not been as restrained and left as my wife did. Getting up in a woman’s face and doing this, crazy, I was convinced not to go back and have a word with this “gentleman” so that I would not end up behind bars before my daughters wedding, Christmas, New Years, etc.
Needless to say, before you sign off on any purchase here, please ensure the work is completed properly, or shop elsewhere as I’m sure there are many other reputable and civilized bridal places in San Diego.<//text>< Pics>

Customer Service is excellent and they give their professional advice about what to pick out for every single event.

I've rented here several times for weddings and black tie events.

The store is open 7 days a week so in case of an emergency you can always call them or walk in. They also have same day service for certain styles.

Highly recommend this place based on his service and variety of styles and colors.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMscvEAGTtPOamJDB64JQhNqwlMC4oWeSyo2Yvn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>{'time': 1580066671358, 'text': 'Thank you Mark, for writing such kind words about us.

< Review>
The new owners at Bridal and Tuxedo Galleria are amazing! I didn't have an appointment, but Gloria took such good care of me and I ended up walking away with my dream dress. So thankful that I stumbled across their information. I would highly recommend Bridal and Tuxedo Galleria for all your special event needs!< /Review>

<Review>They have been very helpful in our wedding. They have a good variety of wedding dresses as well as bridesmaid dresses. I found my wedding dress and my bridesmaid dresses there. It can definitely be a one-stop shop as they also sell accessories and tuxedo rentals for the groom/groomsmen. In regards to staff, Maria is awesome. She is very helpful and supportive. Their prices are very competitive and their store promotions make it that much better. I am glad to have come to this bridal store.<//Review>< Pictures>

This is a lovely shop with so many beautiful options for wedding dresses at very reasonable prices. Their system for choosing dresses to try on is so easy, and makes the process so much more efficient and organized than other shops. The staff are all terrific, and Janet, the manager is extraordinarily helpful, sweet, and patient. It's a very small space (though they still have TONS of dresses) -  I recommend making an appointment during a less popular time so you have more space to see yourself in the mirror and have your guests sit comfortably.  I highly recommend this shop!<//text>

<Text>They have this computer system where I can see pictures of dresses in human models and then choose ones to try. Also they gave me hard copies of the dresses that I chose as for my top 2. So easy and convenient!! The conditions of their samples are excellent and prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this place.</Text>< pics>

<Review>I just went to this place this weekend.
Most important info: If you are a size 12 or above don't waste your time coming here!!!! They won't have a dress for you to try on.

First, the second you walk into the store you feel cramped and crowded. The dresses seemed really worn and the store felt a little low-end.

Second, the lady I spoke with asked me to pick out gowns that I liked from an IPad. She barely spoke to me to get my input of what I like or don't or what I was looking for.

Third, you will have to share the stage with other girls modeling for their guest. Everyone is around the stage watching and talking among themselves and sometimes loudly. They didn't even have enough chairs for two out of four of the people that came with me. They had to stand.

Fourth, the lady helping was nice herself, however she only could get me size 10s and was trying to force them onto me saying she could try to pin it or I should hold up the top to get the style. I told her I couldn't even get a good idea since I was just holding it up. When they didn't fit, I feel like she started to panic and was just finding ANY dress that could fit. I was able to try ONE size 12 dress that fit, however that was it. She was just trying to sell me a dress, not trying to find my dress.

It doesn't make any sense to me to only have size 10s and below for dresses. Which is fine, however then you should indicate that on your website that you only have samples that are 8-10.

If you are a 25 year old, at most a size 8, and on a tight budget, you will probably have good luck finding a dress. But try going to a real boutique and you will have a completely different experience. Luckily earlier that day I went to another boutique and had an incredibly awesome experience so this one didn't ruin my day. I had a private room for myself and the girls, the sales lady sat down and looked at my pictures and then went to gather the dresses and helped me put them on. ALL of them fit with clamps on the back for excess materials.

Good luck and I hope you at least go to another boutique for a real experience!</Review>< pics>

THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY MAKE YOU ORDER LARGER DRESSES JUST SO THAT YOU NEED TO PAY MORE FOR THEM TO FIX THEM ( SUPER EXPENSIVE). THEY TAKE YOUR MEASURES AND THEN DECIDE TO ORDER LARGER DRESSES BECAUSE ¨THEY RUN SMALL¨ (THEY DON´T). AND YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR PLUS SIZES ( I´M NOT EVEN A PLUS SIZE AND THEY MADE ME ORDER A PLUS SIZE).
THEY GAVE ME THE DRESS TOTALLY WRINKLED, IT HAD A FISHY SMELL AND THE STITCHES ARE A MESS. I´M PRETTY SURE THEY ORDER THEM FROM CHINA OR WISH! IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I TRIED ON ON MY FITTING. A TOTAL REGRET!!! AND THEY ACT ALL RUDE AND ACTUALLY KINDA RACIST!  DON´T GO THERE !!! IT´S EXPENSIVE AND A TOTAL RIP OFF< /Review>
<response>{'time': 1580064372233, 'text': "Thank you Perla,\nfor your feedback  The way the bridal industry works is we are instructed to take the brides measurements and then we compare them to the dress designers size chart. We try to order a dress that is closest to the brides measurements however when the dress arrives the brides or bridesmaids in most cases will always need alterations. I'm sorry you didn't have a great experience with us since great customer service is what we are known for.  I can assure you that we treat all people with kindness and respect.

They have a great selection of dresses and I love that they use the iPads to show you the different styles, as I had no idea what I was looking for in the first place. Brianna attended me and she was great and able to find everything I was looking for quickly. After I found my dress, she was also extremely helpful with the veil. Not only did I have a perfect experience finding my dress, they were also extremely knowledgeable about tuxedos and have a wide selection of bridesmaids dresses. I will be purchasing the tuxedos for the groomsmen and dresses for my bridesmaids from here as well. Everything is at a great price for my budget, I couldn't ask for a better experience with this store!</Review>< pictures>

Mayra was so attentive and supportive. Like any bride I wanted to feel good about this experience, and she did everything to make me feel that way. She is so professional and provided options based on the things I said I liked. My whole family had a great time. I for sure will say yes to this dress with Mayra. Xoxo</Text>

<review>They ordered the wrong size bridesmaid dresses for 4 out of 4 of my bridesmaids. They ordered the wrong size tuxes for 4 out of 4 of my groomsmen. When asked what happened, they stated they cant help it if our wedding party gains or losses weight. Our measurements were sent in 6 weeks prior to our wedding, and none of our wedding party had gained or lost weight in those 6 weeks. At least as much weight that would have accounted for the size differences and all 8 members of our party...give me a break! My bridesmaids were forced to pay as much in alteration costs as they paid for the dress. We were running around the day of the wedding trying to get the right sizes of tuxes for our groomsmen. It was a total disaster. I have filed multiple complaints with the manager, he just keeps saying that my wedding party had weight flucuations. Now to my dress. They ordered my dress in a size smaller than I usually wear. When I asked before the order was placed, they insisted that wedding dress sizes run differently than other sizes. I signed off on the order. When I picked up my dress, it was very noticeably too small. By this point we had several small disputes with them about other things related to our wedding, so I just opted to take my dress to a different seamstress. I ended up paying hundreds of dollars in alterations. When I confronted the manager with this, he stated that I had gained weight and then stated "it didn't matter because you signed off on the size." I only signed off on it because they said that the sizes are different on wedding dresses. From the 20+ vendors we used for our wedding they were the ONLY vendor we had issues with. Awful, please do not do business here!!!!</review>< pics>

<Review>Terrible customer service. Very rude! They do not ask your size or help you get into any dresses. They brought all but one of the dresses I wanted to try on in either two sizes too small or four sizes too big and without any help into the dresses. At other stores even if it's not quite your size you have someone who can help you fit into it and they make you feel beautiful. Here, when I asked for help because nothing was fitting they just said that they only had sample sizes so my choices were either a 10 or a 20. At another store they would have offered to help. But instead they just made it sound like my body type was the problem. Terrible, negative experience. If you are higher than a size 10 then please do not go here.< /Review><Name>Amanda L McGimpsey< /Name>< Response>

<text>Honestly, the best tuxedo place in San Diego!! I went shopping around for the best price in town for a fancy Ralph Lauren Tux for my wedding, since in my wife's culture is custom that i pay for all groomsmen tuxes plus ring boy, (tell me about it lol) so 6 tuxes plus mine was a pretty penny, specially Ralph Lauren. Cheapest I found not including shoes was close to $250 each elsewhere and when I came to this place is was shocked how much cheaper it was and it included the shoes. I won't give out prices but drastic difference. The 5 groomsmen, ring boy and I went in and we got fitted and everything went smoothly, all tuxes were correct in size and ready with time to spare for the wedding. They had every type of color vest, that picking our wedding color  was easy. The return post wedding of the tuxes was easy as well. I went in looking for a tux and came out making a friend for a lifetime, the owner Enrique is a classy guy, helpful, knowledgeable and amazing. I found my tux place, I was thinking of buying a tux for future wedding's but with the prices and friendship I built with Enrique, I look forward to coming by many many times. Thank you Enrique from your new life long friends, Suzane & Jonathan.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d955b7f66baae9:0xb3f957c952f2eb4b</gmap_id></record>

< review>
Emily was fantastic. She was always smiling and sharing stories with me and she let me browse through their whole collection. I easily found a replacement dress for the one I lost at Bride & Veil (see my awful review of them on their google site). Everything went great until alterations. The price of the dress was less then HALF the price of the one I lost (big thumbs up), BUT the alterations made up for it. $400! I understand that hemming a lace dress is a pain in the butt especially when it has beading, but $400?! I sucked it up and agreed to it because my wedding was just around the corner. I was told I would be able to pick my dress up in about 3 weeks with one fitting in between to make sure it was what I wanted. I went in for the fitting and it was still all pins! Nothing was sewn yet. I figured I don't know anything about alterations so maybe they worked faster then I thought and this would be ok. This was 1 week away from my pick up date. I went in on the date to pick up and it WASN'T DONE! It wasn't even STARTED! The alterations lady (who is super sweet, but this still upset me) said that their other alterations lady quit and she had to pick up the slack for her, and their was an emergency dress that had to be done that day and my dress would be ready the next day. I was super stressed out at this point. My fiance went to pick up the dress for me and did the inspection and said he was concerned but would bring it home for me to see. When I saw it I almost had a breakdown. The back panel (behind the corset ribbon) was FALLING OFF. There were little threads hanging out all over. The appliqué looked like they were put on a different kind of tulle then they were made on and the edges were frayed (not trimmed up). I really wanted to give a good review because everyone was so sweet there, but I was so upset with the results I just can't give all stars. I am not saying not to shop here, I think you'll have a good experience here, just be sure to be VERY CLEAR about ALL DETAILS of your alterations, and stay on top of it, don't just trust it will be done right.< /review>

I had even look this place up and read some reviews, I just thought only people who had a bad experience were posting and that no one was posting anything good. Please listen to the reviews. My first appointment was fine and the sales lady was very helpful. After that the seamstress was horrible. They took over 5 weeks to do 5 inches of beading and add a hook in the back. Each time I was to come in for a fitting they called me the day before to say they needed more time. They also asured me that my dress would be cleaned and all of the lose threads trimmed before I picked it up.  This was not case. I have spent hours fixing my dress. I ended up canceling the tux reservations to save our self the headache.  Take everyones advice and spend the extra money some place else!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service. Came here a year ago for my wedding dress and now that I will be a bridesmaid for my friend's wedding I knew I would have to get my alterations done here because they do such good work especially Julia.< /Review>

By the name of the barber he has an eye for a good cut for every single customers who sit on the barbers chair and knows what shape of head you have and he will recommend a good barbers cut according to your head shape. They have an app to download, once you download the apps it will show the names of barbers and their work schedule I recommend and look for Sam, as I’ve said he has an eye of hair cut for every customers. They are located at university street just off on 15 north freeway. Keep in mind come early if you have an appointment with Sam due to the parking spot and it is located along university street so this will be hard to find for a parking spot.

Live in the area, so I decided to check it out. The staff is getting drunk and high. The guy I was waiting for skipped me twice to help his friends or regulars.  Then when I finally think I'm up he just packs his stuff and leaves. I waited an hour for him. Then I go to wait for another barber and no one will help me nowing I was waiting there way before these other fools. After another 45 minutes I finally left. This place SUCKS.<//Review>

Top notch all the way around! From the upper management ,to The barbers themselves. What really warmed my heart though, was the high risk youth they employ. mentoring, and teaching a work ethic. That they all hope and pray will keep him on the right path throughout his life.As he cleans and sweeps up the shop,. He gives you a nod and a friendly hello with a smile on his face then I look at all the barbers and see all the smiles on their faces.Kudos to all!</text>

Nobody greeted or welcomed me in, just told me to write my name on the walk-in list. After 45 minutes of waiting I decided to leave because many of the barbers there are not doing their jobs, just chilling on their chairs or outside smoking and chatting, I felt unwelcome and just left without a haircut.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Booked an appt for 12:45. Confirmed - I show up at 12:42 and told my barber is sick and I could either schedule another appointment or sit as a walk-in. I asked how long, told 20 minutes. An hour later and no one is making eye contact, barbers that are free are avoiding me and taking their friends. Word to management: don't treat your new customers like this. Absolute shame trying to support urban business. So disappointing, but that's how it works.</Review>

Definitely a welcoming environment, I am always greeted when I walk in and even though I get my hair cut by the same person it’s great to see all of the barbers there dedicated to their craft. It seems like the owner put in the effort to find the right people. Regardless of you have a scheduled appointment or you’re a walk in, you can definitely count on getting great service and getting tended to promptly so i would highly recommend if you’re in the neighborhood!<//text>

Outstandingly fresh haircut. Dropped in on a Thursday after lunch and got seated in 30 min. Clean medium fade with attention to detail. Strong recommendation.</Review>

<Review>I wish I had a better experience here when I took my son. The first time the staff was smoking weed outside and in the back of their business. The person who cut my sons hair smelled like weed, my son is only 11 and I don’t want him around that. The second visit the staff was drinking in the open and was visibly drunk while cutting customers hair. I shouldn’t have let my son come the second time after seeing the staff high. It seems like the owner spends a lot of money on making sure the business looks nice but his staff is out of control. To top it all off, during the second visit one of the barbers was drunk and yelling/fighting with his coworker. I was ashamed that my son was witnessing all of this. Never returning here again for those reasons. Anyone with children should avoid this place!</Review>< Pics>

Dirt bags. Call and ask if you can be seen today. See what happens. Tell you, "Oh, definitely, as long as you're here by 5:30!".

5:15.....

Turned away.

Sorry.

Never again.< /Review>

<Review>This is my spot but only because I followed my barber here I'm very picky when it comes to my hair, I've been with my barber Nolan for about 3 years, but other than that this place is nothing but positive vibes!</Review></record>

<text>For those who deal with trauma going to Dentist

I can’t even express the countless times I wanted to step into a Dentist to adjust my teeth’s, but I’ve never had enough courage to enter let alone continue a presider, long story short I had huge imprinted trauma going to dentist and just hearing dentist equipment, it trigger inside me pain and suffering of thoughts and emotions. This was the first time I’ve been to a dentist that I feel completely comfortable, there hospitality, catering manner and patient to here my trauma experience, they at least understood my pain. Everyone of the staff and dentist said the right words I needed to here to allow myself to trust and go on the needed procedure I been lagging on for years. There concerned and alertness has made me feel truly cared for before, during and after all the process of the procedure. I am proud of myself for being able to experienced and overcome one of my biggest fear which was stepping foot into a dental office and getting any work done.

I have to admite, it was very clever that when I walked in this place it didn’t feel like I was at a dental office, which did not tap in right away to my fears. Not even the the name of this dental place trigger any idea in my mind that I was stepping into a Dentist.

I can’t thank enough to the ladies who work there, thank you for the support. A huge thank you to the doctor that took his time to listen as I explain to him my situation and he worker with me emotionally and financially thank you Dr. for what I can only call this experience the outmost best experience I could had possibly have and encouraged me to continue to go with him for the rest of my dental needs. With out a doubt this is my spot I will continue to come.

The past trauma is the hardest thing to overcome and let go but thank God I was led to the right people on the right time. Thank you<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c32defeccd2f95:0x8ff5f17e953057a5< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nothing short of excellent service -- from the moment you're greeted by Martha at the front desk and Danielle calls you back to see the doctor, everyone makes you feel welcome and is full of smiles (which would make sense, at a dentist's office). I would normally prefer a root canal to a teeth cleaning, but Joyce really made it as close to painless as possible, and she gave me tips on how to maintain better gum health. Finally, both doctors -- Dr. Soboh and Dr. Liswi -- are fantastic and really put your mind at ease. I have seen both for my dental work, and have complete confidence in their expertise and recommendations. I am a patient for life.<//Text>

< review>
I have always received superb dental care that is ethical and honest from both Dr. Soboh and Dr. Liswi. Their staff is always warm and welcoming and is always attentive to my concerns. Perhaps the best attestation to my satisfaction with this practice is that I have (and continue to) recommend it to all my family and friends.<//review>

This review is long overdue! We had to re-home our German Shepherd a couple of years ago. The process was challenging as we loved our dog. We simply could not give him the life he deserved and needed. Lorraine was honest with us in the beginning. The goal was to find him the right home. Not just any home. With patience and support from both sides we found Gonzo the best home. We still think about him and ask for updates of his progress. Two years later, it is wonderful to hear positive news from his new owner. I trust this rescue and could not be happier knowing he is in good hands. They have the dogs best interest in mind and I’ve very grateful.< /text>

<review>Shepherds are the best dogs and Coastal German Shepherd Rescue is absolutely the best place to get yours!  I've grown up with Shepherds since I was a child, back when you bought them from breeders. Now there are too many amazing dogs looking for homes because people don't understand the amount of work it takes but the reward it provides when you put in the effort.  Coastal takes in all Shepherds no matter the situation or their condition.  They train them, socialize them, provide medical support and get them ready for adoption. When I was ready to adopt my most recent Shepherd they were very upfront about his background and current needs (not the best hips). I also needed a dog that got along with cats and they're very honest in that regard for dogs that probably wouldn't do well. Join them at their adoption events or check out their website but I guarantee you'll  have a positive experience in your search (at Animal Control I always feel so bad for the ones left behind that I just can't go, at Coastal, none are 'left behind', they will all be taken care of for their life). You'll also go home with a dog that might not have started with the best life but Coastal will have already improved it enough for them to be comfortable with you and in your home!< /review>< pictures>

Enormous portions for both food and drink! The food is heavy and tasty - but I really mean it when I say heavy, not for the faint-hearted. We food coma'd for a good hour after our meal, but we also ordered too much; again, come prepared.
It does get crowded so come early if you can. We ended up getting seated in a dark corner facing the wall. (To be honest, we didn't really care; we just started inhaling our food.)< /Text>

They put to many requirements to adopt a dog. I am a good working on person who wanted to give a dog a good home.I was willing to pay the $375 adoption fee. But no too much. I hope that poor dog find a way out of the kenel to a loving and free place.</Text>

<Review>I have a disability and am looking for a dog to adopt for the purpose of an emotional support animal. ESAs need not be trained, and the letter I have from my doctor certifies my need for the treatment, not for the dog. My apartment complex is aware of this, and I informed this recuse a simple phone call to my landlord would tell them I am allowed to have ANY dog. They insisted they only had “rescue dogs” and would not adopt to me.

I tried to explain to them what an ESA is, since they did not understand, but I got the same exact response as before, which is frankly rude and insulting. The only new information was at the end telling me to try another rescue.

This rescue BLATANTLY discriminates against disabled people. I feel so sad for the dogs in their possession, because seeing some of these reviews, I know that so many of them could have had their furever homes already. It is so sad that the dogs have to be punished for the behaviors of the volunteers in charge.

If you aren’t the ABSOLUTE PERFECT adopter, you will not be given the time of day. If you are disabled, you might as well not even apply.

I cannot BELIEVE the treatment that I received from this rescue. Do not support them, I would not recommend to anyone.<//Review>< Pics>

I said "ok I have two small kids, do you have a dog that would be good with kids?" They offered me two options, and wow. If anything they under sold the dog and how good she was. I found them extremely honest and my dog is pretty well trained. They have the dogs best interest at heart so when they tell you I think you should do this, do it. They have done nothing but make sure it is a good fit. Any questions I have after the fact they have answered it.< /Text>< Time>

< review>
We are approaching the one year anniversary of adopting our beloved Buddy from Coastal and we are so impressed and grateful for the wonderful work these folks do!  Lorraine was great to work with and although the application process involves screening, etc. we totally understand this is in the best interest of the dogs.  They are a wonderful group who really work hard to help do many abused, abandoned dogs who simple want a loving family and forever home.  They really care for the dogs and are not just trying to place with the first person who come along (and may not be the best fit. Someone commented the fee was too high for a “mutt”- I found this comment so ignorant and disrespectful.  Coastal cared for my poor abused guy for 9 months all on donations and caring volunteers.  The $300-400 fee is a fraction of the cost to care for a dog for 9 months or longer.  Do you really think a dog from a breeder is “more valuable”?  I think you should reconsider your values.</review>

Coastal (more specifically Lorraine) was great through out entire adoption process! She responded quickly, recommended a few dogs that would fit our stated needs and set up a meet and greet with our husky. We went from application to adoption in 4 days.

We now have an amazing shepherd thanks to their expertise in selecting a dog for us!</text>

<Text>Wonderful organization! We adopted our two girls from them 5 years ago and have been fostering with them ever since because they CARE about the welfare of their animals and want them to do well long-term. The amazing people who run this organization selflessly give up so many evenings and weekends to help out the dogs, many of whom would never have survived without Coastal's help. If you are looking to adopt this is a great place - they won't just take your check, they want you and your new dog to become forever family. If you are looking to donate or volunteer, please do - I love the peace of mind that comes from knowing my foster pups go to people who will love them forever.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1560265532555, 'text': 'Thank you so much for fostering the dozens and dozen of dogs you helped save!

I've adopted  4 dogs over the past 12 years from Coastal. Everyone I've dealt with or met has a heart for getting the dogs into good homes that are the right fit. Many volunteers  give many hours to help out the dogs.  A wonderful rescue with many dedicated loving people. I recommend it to all my friends.<//text>

<text>Sorry to say but I would never recommend this place to anyone. I was left in the dust this week by Lorraine who in my opinion has no business abusing her power of qualifying or disqualifying people to have a special dog like Duke or Brody in which I have spent the last year waiting to find. As others have said I fully support the work they do but this lady basically did what ever she could to be rude and abuse her ability while giving me no chance to adopt. I was divorced 2 years ago which was a complaint rip of my heart from chest to loose my angel and with her went my 2 labs deuce and Peyton. I now live in apartment and Lorraine took what the apartment says is a policy as there would be no reason to even talk to me or follow up or call me. She simply just stopped answering my emails begging to listen to what I was told by the apartment Complex manager himself. While they have a policy against GSD AND 7 other breeds they also have a policy for a service dog in which my lab was a service dog who I trained to be with me at all times as i was going to with my new RESCUE GSD. i would have that paperwork in a matter of days. But no this power hungry human decided to say screw me and I wasn’t even enough of a person to which she owed a phone call to. What if i have the money to move out of here right now based on getting the right dog??? What if i own a house that I can move back to??? What If maybe by calling me we could of resolved this and given a home to a great big dog that takes a great big guy to handle as mentioned in the description of both dogs. What if that man had no other thing in his life right now and needed that dog to help bring him back from lonely times and sadness. Maybe the dog was more important than this lady with her power trip should be able to decide. I’ve owned 4 dogs in my life 2 died and the other two are with my son and are fully trained yellow labs. I trained them with my son. My dream since my divorce was to have a GSD a BIG one that O can do agility training with and also hikes and beaches to mountain trips. I bought a truck and made a special rack so he as a killer transport vehicle and he would go with me to work every day.

Thanks Lorraine. The decisions you make effect other people and you have ruined my year. Your not a good person to be in your power position and I will stop all my funding and encourage the 5 others I know that sent me here to do the same.

Ps I spoke to the manager 5 min after you called in there. He told me what he needed and would of told you the same. You never asked me if I qualified for service Dog status.

Still alone!!!!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1569651714461, 'text': "Hi, Sean. We're sorry you feel that way. There was no response to our last email, so not sure what you mean by us not responding. You live in an apartment complex which bans GSDs and GSD mixes. As you were applying for a GSD and a GSD mix, we informed you about your complex's policy. We received two emails stating that we were incorrect about the policy and requested that you contact your complex directly to hear what we'd been told about the breed ban. You then informed us that service dogs were allowed, despite the breed ban. We responded by letting you know that we do not have service dogs and any dog who can pass the SD assessment test is donated to another nonprofit org who helps people in need of such. The dogs we have available for adoption are pets, not service dog candidates. We don't place dogs as service dogs to get around breed restrictions, as that would be setting them up to fail and also breaking the law. We are only looking out for the best interest of the dog and we hope you understand."}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The work this organization does on behalf of GSDs is nothing short of amazing!  They go above & beyond to place the dogs in their care with the most appropriate home....not just any home!  And once a dog is part of the Coastal family, that dog has lifetime support. We adopted Steele from Coastal over 5 years ago and he had been with them for several years prior to us adopting him....he had an amputated tail, anxiety and was large & menacing looking (but not a mean bone in that dog’s body!). They made sure we were the most suitable family for him....their obligation is to the dogs in their care...NOT to prospective adopters. It turned out to be a fantastic match and Steele found his forever home with us!  I recommend Coastal to anyone interested in a GSD and I wouldn’t hesitate to go back to them when we’re ready for our next GSD!  Keep up the great work Coastal!!< /review>

<name>Kristina Pacek<//name><Time>1537382129890</Time><rating>5</rating><review>My husband I have had great experiences with Coastal over the past several years.  We first fostered with them some years ago with a dog named Mac. We had been interested in adopting him, but weren't sure if we were ready for a dog, yet. Fostering was a great way to get a feel for how he would fit into our lives. He was a great dog, but was ultimately adopted out to a wonderful family who were better suited to his needs. We fell in love with fostering with them, and picked up another. She had a congenital eyelid issue, and Coastal paid for her surgery. Again, adopted out to another great family.  Our third foster was Buddy, an AmStaff that they picked up from a kill-shelter, and we fell in love.  We weren't planning on keeping him at first, but ultimately didn't have the heart to let him go. 4 years later, he's brought us so much joy, and we even fostered a few more along the way!

As an organization, Coastal is amazing.  They do so much for their dogs and really try to get them in the best possible home.  People sometimes get upset that they don't just hand dogs out to whomever asks for one, but it's really about making sure that a dog and family are a good match for each other.  They take the time to get to know the dogs and their needs. I would highly recommend Coastal to anyone interested in adopting a GSD (or any other dog)!< /review>< Pictures>

I have 3 German shepherds two of which came from Coastal.  All three of mine are very different from each other.  My female is very alpha and needed major training,  the two boys are very smart and while doing training for my female I did lots of trainings with my boys.  I have had 4 GSD's. And each one I learn something different.  The old man I rescued through Coastal I got back in 2013 and he was supposed to be 11 per the vet.  Even my vet aged him at 10 to 11.  Well he is already to grouchy to go to doggie heaven, but I've learned so much from him and wouldn't trade him for anything.  I fostered him first had him for 2 years, nobody wanted him because of his attitude.  I lost my first German shepherd and Lorraine put the old man's bio up.  I called her in tears thinking I was going to have to give him up.  She was so sweet and understanding and took the bio down and told me it was ok to be a foster failure.  I still remember that conversation and love her for it.  I've called her numerous times for help or for advice and shes always been dead on.  I've done house checks for Coastal and they really care about their dogs and their adopters.  I've  fostered a dog that had gone to a home as a puppy and returned.  The guy was a vet and thought he knew all about GSD's he was a vet.  It took me months to pull poor Abbey out if her traumatized shell.  She was as skittish as a coyote.  Just because you know "dogs" does not mean you should own a German shepherd.  Do your research.  Learn the bread, join FB groups so that you learn how they act with their humans.  I know Germans, but that doesn't mean I should take on a Malinois.  Thank you Coastal for doing what you do best, you look out for the animals, they are always your priority.<//Text>

They help as many dogs as they can, and always give updates on their pups that need homes. They don't shy away from the more difficult medical cases, and work very hard to ensure every dog gets the proper medical attention and rehabilitation, if needed. I highly recommend fostering or adopting from Coastal and utilizing their expertise in all aspects of owning a dog.<//text>< GmapID>

I was extremely disappointed with Coastal German Shepherd Rescue. I first want to say that I really appreciate and respect the work they do, but my family and I didn't have the experience we had hoped to have.

My family and I fell in love with a bonded pair and between all of us sent in four applications for them because we were not receiving information about continuing the process or if we were rejected. We have tried reaching out through telephone, email, and though facebook. We know they not only received our facebook message but read the message, they just didn't bother to reply. I was really excited about this potential process, but sadly I got my hopes up big time. I really hope that Axel and Avery (the bonded pair) get that forever home soon because they deserve all the love in the world.

I also hope the next family has better luck and is able to take one of those deserving dogs home.

<Text>Over 30 years, my husband and I adopted 8 rescued dogs, mainly German Shepherds.  Over 1 extended period, we had 4 dogs - 2 German Shepherds, a Husky and a Coydog.  Because we have only 1 German Shepherd now, we applied to Coastal to adopt another one.  To our surprise and dismay, we were rejected with no explanation.  Fortunately (or unfortunately), there are many dogs needing adoption and we adopted a young Husky from another animal care facility without any problem.  My concern is that Coastal is injuring the very animals they purport to help by preventing their adoption by caring and responsible individuals.  In this case they also hurt their organization - we are million dollar donors to UC Davis Vet School and significant supporters of other worthy animal care organizations.

In response to the owner:  The review is for your organization - I use my maiden name professionally.  My married name is Greenwood.< /Text>< userid>

Excellent non-profit rescue organization!! Strives to place dogs that deserve a second-chance into new furever homes that fit both the family and the dog. I personally have 3 of their dogs and couldn't be happier!!< /Review>

<Text>Thank you, thank you Coastal GSR! The entire adoption process was a great experience! A special thank you to Liz, for being so patient and supportive with me and my numerous emailed questions.

Just one year ago Coastal German Shepherd Rescue rescued our hearts by allowing us to rescue Daisy! Coastal German Shepherd Rescue is a reputable conscientious group that pulls needy dogs from deplorable conditions and works endlessly to rehabilitate and rehome them. They take in the toughest of cases, sick, injured, unsocialized, and untrained puppies and adult dogs. They do amazing things to heal their bodies and spirits before they are able to be adopted. Truly an amazing organization!

Edit:
I happened to notice that a few “unhappy potential adopters” have slammed Coastal German Shepherd Rescue and even lashed out personally at specific volunteers by name. I can speak from personal experience going through the process of adopting a young unsocialized, reactive GSD, that without the help and support of Lorraine, a volunteer adoption coordinator, this adoption could have failed. It’s been three years now, and my rescue girl is an amazing smart, confident, typical GSD, but I doubt we would have gotten here without the support of Lorraine and her extensive knowledge and experience.
Since then, we have fostered two and are currently fostering a 3rd GSD, all who had been seriously injured and were VERY reactive to other dogs. Again, without the constant support and advice from Lorraine, we wouldn’t have been able to keep these very deserving dogs until they could be adopted.
So if you feel like you’re under a microscope, or getting the inquisition of a background check, trust that Coastal knows their dogs, and only wants to place a dog where it will be a good fit. Keep in mind that a dog in a rescue has had whatever traumatic experiences it may have had, and probably has been neglected, unsocialized and most likely not had any training. Believe me, they know these dogs and they know their stuff.<//review>

Lorraine, Roger and the team at Coastal are absolutely awesome. We rescued our GSD a year ago and couldn't be happier. Take advantage of YDT dog training for basic obendience skills training!< /Review>

Fun little beach area on the north shore near kings beach.  Area is fairly rocky with some sand areas. But a great location to put in a kayak or paddleboard or to have a family picnic, play some beach volleyball or to soak up some sun (in the summer).< /Review>

A free beach in North Lake Tahoe with not much recreational or lounging area but beautiful views. Great proximity to tourist attractions in the area. You’re bound to see birds enjoying the views with you!</Review>

The black sand makes waves under the water. Very visually appealing. All the restrooms were locked, or it would have got 5 stars for it's very cute, small beach area. (Rocky at the shoreline, turns to sand and goes pretty far out as very shallow)< /Text>

Very busy but a great place to swim & enjoy the lake! Parking can be challenging in busy days but Safeway parking lot across street works for 90 monsters if you buy something!< /review>

Love this place, water is super clean. There is a lot to do from just hanging on the beach side,  to boat rentals,  paddle boats, water skiing,  rafting tours, water trails. Really family friendly</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I highly recommend A Touch of Gold Pet Grooming! I got an appointment the same day that I called. They're so kind, & detail oriented. My German Shepherd got a de-shed, & didn't have one loose hair after which is very impressive!! She left shiny, fluffy, & fresh! I'm very pleased with the work. I'll be recommending A Touch of Gold Pet Grooming to my friends, & anyone looking for a new groomer.🐾❤️🐶🐕🐕‍🦺❤️🐾<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>This is the only groomer who successfully completed an entire grooming session on my two, 7-month-old puppies. They even went above and beyond and threw in complimentary bleaching shampoo for my white Husky. They were very responsive and did all this for us at a very last-minute, same day appointment. I'm so grateful for these ladies!< /Text></record>

I love A Touch of Gold Pet Groomer! Always able to squeeze my furbabies in! And they really listen when you ask them to cut a certain style!  I went through a handful of groomers that would butcher my babies hair so bad 👎  so glad to finally get the recommendation for this place!  They always have my furbabies looking and smelling fresh!</text>

After searching for weeks, I looked into A Touch of Gold Grooming, and I couldn't be happier! I have two larger lab mixes, one long hair and one short hair. My short haired one got a bath and is so soft! My long haired one got a bath and hair cut. Both of their ears are the cleanest ever! And they both smell amazing! They got me in the SAME day! (which is a huge plus for me!) Their prices are VERY reasonable! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you guys, I will definitely come to you next time we need services!</Text>

When I came to pick up my dog, she had a huge gash Behind her ear. She came back drugged up, losing her balance for 2 days. I regret paying for this type of service. I expected to come back to a shaved dog not a drugged up bloody dog.</text>

< review>
My dog suffered hemorrhages in both of his eyes after being groomed here. When I questioned the employee about it, he stated that his eyes were already “like that” when I dropped him off. I THINK I WOULD'VE NOTICED IF MY DOG HAD HEMORRHAGES IN BOTH OF HIS EYES before we left the house. Not to mention, he still hasn’t stopped shaking and was scared to move when I picked him up. These are all red flags. Please do yourself and your pup a favor and go somewhere else. Yes they’re affordable, but not at the expense of your fur baby.</review>

They went above and beyond. SO AFFORDABLE. Went for a bath and a brush for my German Shepherd. Got their shedding treatment. She's so soft, plus, it came with everything from nail trim to anal gland expression! I have one happy, clean pup!< /review>

<Review>Tanisha is amazing and my dog who hates getting groomed doesn’t hate the place too much. She doesn’t like it but she doesn’t fight us on going which is all I can ask for.</Review>< pics>

This is our third visit for our dog Ghost. Each time they have done an amazing job. They even called us last time to double check before doing something (we asked for a schnauzer cut but wanted her tail left fluffy) I was impressed they called to clarify. They make her look and smell amazing. Definitely recommend them!<//review>

This place is very professional. After taking my dogs to other places, I finally found the best one! A Touch Of Gold. It is obvious for me, after my dogs were groomed there. They smelled great. They are always excited to get in, when we get there. It's the only place I will take my precious Boston Terrier, Dug E. (we took our 1st dog Rookie Martin, there too,  who recently passed away-A Touch Of Gold, was so caring, and compassionate, and shared our pain-Very personable! We appreciated the flowers, Tanisha)
I recommended this place to my niece who also has a dog, Tank. They loved it, as well.<//text>

<text>I had gone to Classy K-9 Clips for 10 years, but once she sold it to another owner, I thought I would try a new groomer.  What a mistake!  I have a long hair Chihuahua which my husband explained to the guy at the counter how we like the grooming to be done since it was his first visit.  When he picked him up he had shaved most of his coat to about 1/4 inch.  That has only happened once by mistake in the 13 years we have had him.  He looked like a cross between a poodle cut and a lion with a long mane.  They had shaved his pants off, but left puffs of hair on his legs.  We were not happy at all, but considering his age, we didn't think it would matter as much. We are on bonus time with his heart/kidney diseases.  After getting him home, we noticed they hadn't even cleaned his ears.  I don't know if it was an "off" day with the two guys working there, but we are never going again!</text><gmapID>0x80dc7035b68658b5:0xe9576d52de25ef2e< /gmapID><Response>None< /Response></record>

Called around the different groomers on a Saturday morning and all the groomers were booked except for A Touch of Gold Pet Grooming. My puppy was desperately  in need of a cut and I couldn't wait until the following weekend. A Touch of Gold came through and I will be coming back here for the second time in a couple of months!<//Text>

My yellow lab Daisy had been to A Touch of Gold Pet Grooming a handful of times for a bath, nail clipping and brush.  They've always done wonderful and Daisy always comes out eager to leave but happy. Today was the first time trying the teeth cleaning. Oh my gosh I was amazed. Daisy back teeth were horrible and the vet would charge me over $800 to put her out and work on her. Tanisha did this for $100 and they are white as can be and Daisy didn't have to be put under anesthesia. Would so recommend this place.<//review>

I am so THANKFUL for Tanisha and her exceptional grooming to animals!  Today was my first visit and she was so helpful working with my time frame and taking care of my White Jindo Dog, Evie.  I was astonished to see how beautiful, groomed, nails clipped, ears cleaned, etc and how happy our little girl was after a wonderful bath.  Highly recommend and will be a customer forever!!!!<//Text>

<review>Terrible experience! Brought my dog in for a grooming with pictures of how I'd like her cut. Spoke to the owner,Tanisha Banks, she said her daughter would do the cut. When I picked up my dog her cut was nothing like the picture. She claimed she thought the pictures were for another dog. Although my card specifically asked for the Teddy Bear cut. She said she would give me a discount on the next cut which her mother would do. I showed up for my 10:30 appointment and Tanisha hadn't made it in. I left at 11:00 and she still wasn't there and I never received the courtesy of a call. If you care about your dog this isn't the place to go!< /review>< pictures>

They were very friendly. The hair cut is ok. Very uneven. I have to take scissors to cut all of the long weird hair that was missed. For the price they aren't too bad. They do have top notch customer service.< /Text>

They deffinetly over schedule. My dog has been there 4 hours a couple of times just for a bath. When you schedule for a certain time you would assume he would be worked on right away since that is his slot you had to schedule for, but apparently not here. They kept him in a cage for a while before even taking care of him. I only got him back once where he looked really good. Other times he came back still wet and didn't look any better then what I could have done. Every time I took him there he got so scared and wouldn't move from the door. It was concerning for me that he acted like that because he never does. I don't take him there anymore.<//Review>

Just lovely.... a rare find lovely. I can not say enough for this shop. Large, very well done. If there was a ten star I would give it. They truly have a gift for the public. A true class act. The flowers, everything is lovely. An overwhelming, it takes your breath away.</review>

<Review>These people have no shame. Yesterday they delivered flowers ordered by our son for my wife's birthday. The dahlias were partially wilted with yellowing leaves and some kind of disease on them.  Peonies were closed tight and the buds looked beat up and dirty.

I called them today and was told that peonies come from Holland and "this is not really a good time for them." When I asked why they do not tell this to people they did not explain. I actually have been to their shop and it is quite good, but it seems like they just unload old flowers to home deliveries.  Shameless.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Juan and Mercedes own a piece of sunshine. Their Ladera Garden Center is a must see- even if you don’t plan to buy flowers or trees or floral arrangements or wonderful gifts for friends and family. You’ll feel better just walking through the nursery’s extensive outdoor garden and browsing.
Any negative feelings you might have going in- will be gone by the time you depart.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fa5409e11d4c7:0x78d58dc0005f9002</gmap_id><Time>1620106402987<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I've lived in Portola valley since 1984 and I've never seen such a hard working family as these owners . The selection in this store is truly amazing ,its a holiday spirit with every decor for the holidays imaginanabl The hard work they put into this store as a loving team is truly an inspiration for all to see. My farther in law wanted to surprise us with some beautiful landscaping and the owner came to our home and did it all himself .I have one of the most beautiful maple trees thanks to him. I highly recommend them and if you want to see the most beautiful xmas decorations visit this store its filled with beautiful holiday spirit that is truly amazing.
They have every beautiful gift you can dream of and the owners are the sweetest couple ever . The best in the bay area< /Review>< Pics>

Outstanding nursery & gifts destination... out in the nursery are row after row of gorgeous healthy plants in variety of sizes ~ annuals, perrinials, herbs, succulents ~ plus unique items for home & garden. You will find top grade tools, potting soils, pots in all sizes. Super friendly owners & staff. No matter what season, a visit to Ladera Garden & Gifts lifts my spirits!< /Text>

A friend of mine bought me a plant for Christmas and he asked the owner to wrap it for me.  He told the owner that I would come back and pick it up.  When I went back to pick it up and wasn't wrapped.  The owner said you don't need it wrapped.  That wasn't the point.  Horrible customer service.  I even waited and bought an ornament.  It still wasn't wrapped.  This the season to be jolly.  Didn't feel it with this place.< /review>

Run run run to this wonderful place to buy plants including plants and trees that are special and unusual. This is one of the best remaining family run nurseries on the peninsula. Buy a plant as a present and they will artfully put a bow on it and make it look like a million bucks! Step aside Amazon!<//Review>

<Review>My go-to place for fresh cut flowers and bouquets - they have a great selection. There's a dense nursery area in the back, and a large gift selection inside (housewares, candles, jewelry, kids toys, seasonal). Always friendly. Not cheap, but really nice stuff.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I really like this place. The staff is very helpful and they have a great selection of plants and goods. Not comprehensive but good nonetheless. They also have a nice variety of plant sizes so if you need slightly larger trees or bushes they probably have you covered.< /Review>

<review>CASH only..... This place sits next to the Santa Ana DMV, very small parking lot. It was very busy but they move very quickly. The food is fresh, got and well prepared. We ordered 2 beef/chicken plates and a med beef bowl. It was delicious, the sauce is a little salty but it's concentrated so you don't need much. Pricing is very reasonable they give you a good serving of good. Will be back again soon.</review>< pictures>

The food is great but WARNING the cashier is stealing money. I watched as the cashier rung up my food and it came out to a total of 21.85 dollars and he charged me 22.85 dollars. I thought it was weird so I gave him 40 dollars cash to where he only gave me 15 dollars back. He thought I wouldn’t notice. So I called him out on it and I noticed all the employees get nervous. He was so nervous that I noticed that he dropped one of my plates and had to redo them. Sad thing was that I was going to tip that amount but I personally don’t like being robbed in plain sight. THERES A REASON THEY ONLY CHARGE CASH. It’s a very shady establishment. So be very careful and do your math when you go.

EDIT: I attached my receipt. Your response is that I have to ask for correct change? I’m sorry that is so shady and bad business from your cashier. I understand human error but it wasn’t that. He was STEALING from me on purpose. And who knows how many more people he’s stolen from. Bad business brings bad karma- good luck!< /text>

<text>Why do I love this place so much? First of all I’ve been coming here for over 25 years the plate I order is freshly made and cooked to perfection.  Love their teriyaki sauce and side salad is great as well.  There’s a lot of options for any one that is a picky eater.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Line is always long but they work fast to get you your food. I got a Small Chicken Bowl. It's cash only and the parking lot is small but the quick turnover moves you and out. Extra parking next door at the DMV, perfect for weekend parking. ✌<//review>

Parking lot is impossible to navigate, extremely small and right next to the dmv. Food tasted great, however my chicken was fairly charred. Some people might like that but I fount it to have a slight "burnt" flavor to it. Rice was great. Cash only establishment but there's an ATM with cheap rates.<//review>

OMG! Char grilled taste. They claim Teriyaki, but it's not sweet glazed like typical (I don't like that kind). It is amazing grilled flavor you can't find anywhere but a backyard chef. I'm only visiting and can't stop coming back. Cash only is worth it.<//Review>

I was disappointed today! The bowls were pre made. When I got mine it was cold and didn’t have the taste of freshness 🙄 The chicken was cold as well as the beef!</Review>

For fast food is kinda of healthy after all cuz they cook it all as you order, except the rice of course is already done staying warm. This is the only place where I would eat teriyaki because of the way they prepare it here.
The staff is all friendly guys... pura raza!! (Hispanic)
I've coming here for over 10years people. Give it a try!</text>< pics>

<Review>This is an A-OK teriyaki joint in Downtown Santa Ana. Just one of those really small mom-and-pop kind of joints that makes you get cash from a strange ATM that’s outta network no matter who issued your card. NEVER come here without cash, and I really hope they deliver through DoorDash, Postmates, or at least Grubhub; preferably all three. The seafood combo is pretty good. I just won’t be back because of the payment scheme and a lack of bike parking.<//Review>< Pictures>

Disgusting

The cook in the back had no mask.  He was eating and liking his fingers next to the food around him.
I would be careful with this place during the pandemic.

Plus they only want cash like if we are in the 70's, but they still want to tax you.<//text>

<text>Staff is always friendly. Never waited more than 8 or 10 minutes to get my food after ordering, even during the busiest times. The teriyaki chicken rice bowl is the best in town. Just the right amount of char on lean meat.</text><user_id>112996282041280130212< /user_id>< pictures>

<Text>I was in there yesterday order 3 plates and 2 of them the chicken was super burned. Call to speak to the manager and he told me I needed to bring them back I was like I live to far to take the food back . I told him I could take a picture and I could showed it to him when I was around the area. He was so rude and said well you need to bring them back to get your refund which I never even asked for one in the first place. I told him I couldn’t take them back and he just hung up on me. I was like really what A manager with no training on customer service.< /Text>< Rating>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>This place is a little overpriced for the portion sizes. It tastes very similar to waba grill, but I did find that the chicken was a little fatty. I'd try this place again since I've heard that its delicious. For now I'll give this place three stars because I would have rather just had waba grill or flame broiler< /review>< Pics>

The food is good but service tends to vary. Docking many stars though because of the atm they have inside. It literally steals your money. You get charged the transfer fee as part of your withdrawal so that your bank then also charges you the transfer fee. Essentially charging you twice for the transfer. And they only accept cash here. Very very scummy.</text>

< Review>
I found this place while I was at the DMV yesterday, Dmv was  a few hours wait. As I was waiting outside, I was reading a book, and felt hungry from the smell of charbroiled meet, it smelled tasty. This place is literally right next to the Dmv. I ordered a drink and the chicken bowl. I really really liked it. It kinda reminded me of Flame Broiler which is a favorite fast food place I frequent. Based solely on the taste, Mos No 2 is a notch better! It's flame broiled fresh and and they serve it hot off the grill. If you need to wait at the DMV, you can order food from here and take it over the the outside bench at the dmv and eat it whilst you wait. Made my Dmv experience a little bit enjoyable!< /Review>

The food is good but service tends to vary. Docking many stars though because of the atm they have inside. It literally steals your money. You get charged the transfer fee as part of your withdrawal so that your bank then also charges you the transfer fee. Essentially charging you twice for the transfer. And they only accept cash here. Very very scummy.</review>

The best beef and chicken Teriyaki in all of Orange County. It tastes like magic in my mouth.  Why can’t all restaurants be Mos Burgers?</text>

Mos 2 is the best, we've been coming here for about 15 years, never been disappointed, always prepared fresh, so delicious, the rice fluffy, the gyozas yummy, egg rolls crispy, nice menu and the staff are friendly and ready to take your order, come on over to Mos 2 in Santa Ana 😋 !<//text>

It was decent. Not the best teriyaki chicken I e had and did not live up to the hype. If someone brought some home for me I would eat it again, but probably wont go on my own.< /Review>

tried their best seller a mixture of beef and chicken and the portions were skimpy with so much white rice below these tid bits of meats. the taste on the meats were okay nothing special. the rice was not bad. the included teriyaki sauces and tapatio packets worked well and enhanced this plate. the side salad tasted fresh and the rasberry-like vinaigrette was good. but it felt like it did not belong. also paying $9.75 for this is not right. i pretty much paid for all the hype and in return i got skimpy meats and was therefore not a big slam dunk.

<Review>I love this place!! The best teriyaki chicken I've ever had in my life!! Their sauce is soo delicious and the chicken with the white rice is omg!! I would recommend this place to everyone everytime we go we get the family platter if I could rate this a 10 star I would but this only gives you up to a 5. It's the BEST! place for teriyaki chicken!!<//Review><UserId.>106915902655421241802<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

It was a little noisy and the taste was a bit off comparing the other ones in OC. But overall it was okay</text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>It was the worst place I have ever been to,  the food was okay,  but nothing extraordiary.  And if you feel like being treated like a second class citizen,  then this is place to go.  I was given the twice over look when I requested to use their washroom and then one of the workers and/or manager knocked on the door 2 minutes after I went in.  The employees who worked there were not friendly,  and in no way made me feel comfortable.  The customers were the same,  as I had received stares of indifference from a. Mexican lady.  I do not recommend this place. I guess this place is exclusively for mexicans,  too bad.< /text>< pics>

I came all the way from Colorado to try this Teriyaki! The best I have ever had. I would have given them 5 stars, but I would have liked them to be CC friendly, and have some Sriracha! Other than that, THE BEST!< /review>
