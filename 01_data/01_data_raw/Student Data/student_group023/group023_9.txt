Actually visited a shop next door. Love the fact that they have security patrolling...as the place is clean...no riff raff around..only shoppers. Nice pleasant experience.</text>

My mother had her third visit today and she is very pleased with Michele and looks forward to her appointments. Michele provides excellent service to my mother and she is a great listener as my mother loves talking to her and sharing stories! She also provides me with information regarding hearing loss, how the hearing aids work and how I can help my mother as she goes through the transition of hearing again :) I would highly recommend this location to anyone. The atmosphere is welcoming, friendly and the care that they provide is exceptional :)<//review>

This is THE place to know about when you are in need of a hearing test and/ or hearing aids.  Michele and Katherine, in this office, are extremely knowledgeable, professional and friendly.  Everything is low key and informal.  You will enjoy your visit!!!  I highly recommend this location.< /Text>

<Review>This is probably the absolute best location. For any and all of your audiology needs. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. Sometimes buying these products or realizing you have to protect your hearing even if it’s diminished is kind of a drag. But not at this Miracle Ear location. Kagen is hands down the best employee there, as well. I’d never want to do business with anyone but him, but everyone here is awesome too! Best location in CA! 10/10 will return!<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

First and foremost Alan is the best. I've worn hearing aids for the last decade but can't say I've ever enjoyed them. I wanted to give Miracle Ear a try because most of my friends wear Miracle Ear hearing aids. All I can say is WOW!. Alan set me up with those new "forever batteries" ones and they are so awesome. I hear like I've wanted to for years. They are so natural sounding I forgot I was wearing them....luckily they're water resistant. Love my new ears! Alan is very patient and courteous.</Review>

I first met him at the Citrus Heights office. I felt so comfortable and was so impressed , that when he located to Sacramento I  "followed" him.
He truly knows the business and I could ask him questions without feeling I was questioning him. Alan is thorough and tenacious ! If there is an issue he does not stop until he has an answer.
PLUS, he shares with me the pictures of his son, which makes the visits more personal.
Julie is very friendly and just adorable.

Been taking my mom here and since our first appointment, Julie and Alan have been so good to us! Alan works really hard to help my mom get used to her new hearing aids, and she's had a much better quality of life now that she's had them! He was so patient with her every step of the way, and made sure we were well educated on the importance of hearing health. Knowing what we know now, we definitely try to help bring awareness to our family and friends- and always recommend this office! Julie is always making us feel at home, and is awesome at what she does! The other day she was decorating for Halloween and we can't wait to come back to see all the wonderful work she's put in!<//text>

<review>Alan and Julie made the experience from start to finish an absolute joy for my grandma. It's hard to find people to trust in the medical industry, which is why I always make a point to tag along on appointments like this. From the start though I knew she was in good hands. A few months later and she's hearing better than ever. It's such a joy to see the difference these hearing aids have made in her life!<//review>< Response>

<Text>The experience of a product is partially based on the product, but substantially based on the service and personal interaction of the product specialists.

My Miracle Ear hearing aides are without a doubt a quality product. They are extremely comfortable (don't even know they are there), and help restore my lost hearing. But what makes these outstanding is the service I receive.

Alan truly cares about me and my hearing. He has spent as much time as I needed and exposed options I didn't even know were available. (ot extra charge options, just options for a better hearing experience) He has never tried to upsell me. After the first series of appointments to fine tune the hearing aides, I have an appointment every 3 months for cleaning, replacing od any needed parts, and a general check up. There is no extra charge for this. It's part of the outstanding customer service.

I recently had my first annual hearing test and Alan made some further refinements and made my hearing even better. Again, no extra charge.

I highly recommend this particular Miracle Ear. I have not been to any others, but I have no need to try any others either.</Text>< pics>

I highly recommend Miracle-Ear for your hearing aid needs - I give them an "A+".  Alan and Julie are both very kind and make the visit very enjoyable and relaxing.  Alan is exceptional at fine-tuning the hearing aids, providing follow-up care, and answering your questions.  Miracle-Ear explains also about hearing loss and why hearing aids are good for your health beyond just being able to hear well again.  You will also learn that not all hearing aids are equal and the more expensive ones have more frequency switches to fine-tune the hearing aids for your hearing loss.  People don't always lose hearing uniformly across all frequencies so the frequency switches help fine tune them so you can hear across all frequencies again.  Alan was also incredibly patient with my 90-year old dad through the entire process.<//Text>

We came here for brunch on a Saturday. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Given its location, I imagine this place is busiest on weekdays after work. On Saturday, it had more customers than I expected but still plenty of capacity - so a good place if you fancy brunch but don't want to wait for ages. The food itself was ok - a bit too much fried stuff for my taste, but the sort of menu that goes well with a drinks-forward place of this kind. Comfortable sofas, clean space.<//text>

Will come back again. Wide variety of drinks, unexpected menu featuring game, fast and efficient service. My wife have been looking for good restaurants that are close to Davies hall. This fits the bill.< /text>

<Review>Raw red meat served well.
Pricey and exotic proteins and masterfully crafted drinks.
A place to impress your date or potential investors.
Late dining at it's finest.
Very high ceilings.

On the other hand, we had the place for a private event on Sunday, which was perfect. Parking is an issue around there.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Great atmosphere. The music and lighting were nice. The food was expensive and the portions really small. I ordered the chicken burger and it was insanely small - think half the size of a normal piece of bread. It came with potato chips that had bubbles of oil still in them that popped in your mouth. The staff was also being trained, so I won't be too critical about that, but it took 20 minutes for the food to arrive and 10 minutes to get the check.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

We were there for a meet up with vendors. The fried chicken sandwich was awesome also the vegan scrambled eggs were really good,  the rest wasn't my style but that's just me. The one big gripe I have is no napkins were set out lots of hand foods and no napkins</review>

Cool atmosphere, cushy leather sofa and big selection of drinks. It's pretty pricey and filled with techie millennials but conveniently located near my office so we pop in for a drink every now and then. It's at the bottom of the Twitter building and happy hour drinks are priced at what you would pay for regular cocktails at a normal bar.<//Review>

Mother' Day Brunch superb!   Every dish was a piece of art, and  the taste,  more than pleased the palate.  My favorites were the crab souffle, kefir yogurt parfait, strawberry crepes, and citrus sorbet.
Pleasant surroundings with pleasant people serving . Thanks ,Dirty Water ,

<review>Decent food, great drinks. A bit hard to get to, and it's deep inside the building. They had fewer of the entrées on the menu than they show on their website. Ate at the bar, so don't know about the table seating. Had risotto, which was excellent but not filling. Two gin cocktails,  that were very well made. I noticed a great Whiskey selection,  so am coming back with a buddy to do some further investigation.</review>< pics>

<review>This place is the real deal. My wife & I had the Tomahawk Ribeye w/roasted vegetables & it was cooked perfectly. Awesome meal. My wife is really picky about her Tequila cocktails & they had one on the menu that she loved. Waitress was excellent & the only small complaint we have is the dinner took too long. The Ribeye takes 45 minutes. But all in all, a wonderful experience.< /review>< pictures>

After the show at the Orpheum Theater we walked up the street for happy hour. Our Bartender was nice and friendly and drinks we're reasonable.
Not sure if I'll return anytime soon there's too many other places to try downtown.< /text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><user_id>109343288040597598057</user_id><review>Dirty" is the correct name for this restaurant because that's how they will treat you.  We went here after seeing Hamilton a few months ago.  They even advertised in the program guide.    We had the early showing so we arrived at the restaurant without reservations around 5:30 pm.  The restaurant was empty except for one other party.

There was 6 of us in our party.  We notified the hostess that we saw the advertisement in the program guide and asked if we could be seated.  She said that they were completely booked but we could sit at a high table in the bar.  Ok, fine.  I guess there would be a mad rush within the next 30-45 minutes that they need to accommodate.  ( We were there about 45 minutes),  By the time we left 90% of the restaurant was still empty

We ordered a variety of appetizers, no alcohol and small plates.  All adequate but nothing to brag about.  The service was average.  It should have been excellent given we were the only table she was serving.  We had to ask for water twice.

Now, the biggest reason why I call them "dirty" is this.  My friend insisted he pay for our meal.  For him this is a big expense.  He paid with his credit card and left  $60 cash for the tip (20%). I asked him to see the receipt given the gratuity amount he was leaving.  There was already an 18% tip included on the bill.

Our server gladly took the additional $60 and the built in tip without a peep.  My wife asked the server, was a tip already in the bill.  She commented, "yes, why".  My wife asked the server to return the $60 because our friend was not made aware of this nor did they circle it on the receipt which they typically do.  I was surprised that with a party of 6, they would include a tip.

My wife gave the server additional money so that tip would be 20% total.  The server  didn't even thank us for insuring that she got 20%.  She seemed annoyed that she was caught and had to give her windfall back.

Interestingly enough, my next door had the same exact experience when she ate here.  Bottom line, the service was just OK. food was just OK, but be prepared to be done "dirty" to.< /review><time>1514933257204</time>< gmapID>

This is a great bar. So many beers, whiskeys, cocktails and characters behind the bar.  A little pricey.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We ordered (and shared) the half roasted chicken and the pork chop and both dishes were prepared to perfection with awesome sides! The chicken came with brocollini and potato confit, and the pork chop came with apples, farro, and green beans... we ate everything on our plates, it was all so good. I wish I had taken photos because the plating was really nice, as well, but we just dove in!</review>< user_id>

Absolutely love this place.. The ambiance decor food wine staff was so amazing. Pro tip.. get the piranha ribs o m g so f-ing good. Also if your into wine and whiskey this place has a reserve off the menu selection it's pricy but worth it. I had the marrow which was very tasty, as well as the sweet bread ( first time ever having sweetbread ) pasta is made fresh every day and the octopussy with uni was awesome as well.</Text>

By that I mean the portions were too small for the price and the experience/atmosphere didn't make up for it. Not the most delicious food either. Not worth the visit.<//Review><gmapID>0x8085809c6cbe6673:0x70b0678ac91a64bc</gmapID><UserId.>107711604697201760653<//UserId.><username>John Lee<//username><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I think it will be in the category of luxury restaurants. Food, atmosphere, and customer service are all at a satisfactory level. Is it a little expensive? Also, there is a beer brewery in the store, so you can drink it during the season.

(Original)
高級レストランのカテゴリーに入ると思う。食べ物、雰囲気、接客はどれも申し分ないレベル。惜しいのはちょっと料金が高い事か。また、店内にビールの醸造所が有り、シーズンだと飲めるようです。<//Review>< Pics>

Went here a couple times, only girl with the 2 braids ALWAYS has the worst attitude.. we don't get nothing free so I don't get the attitude and bad customer service. They also try to rush you. they don't even make you feel welcomed. If you don't like this job then go somewhere where you don't need to talk talk to people as much. I saw I'm not the only one who has complained on her so not sure why they still have her there. She's making them loose business for sure! I personally won't be going to this location anymore or recommending<//review>

<Review>I took my boys to this Michoacana a couple of months ago to get them some paletas. My boys loved their water melon and chocolate flavor paletas and I got their mangoneada which was amazing ! Basically we’re all hooked since then! They also have other food items snacks and salads and etc... The employees are extremely friendly and courteous as well as attentive. The place looks very neat and clean. Authentic atmosphere and great authentic music! Check them out. You’ll love it!</Review></record>

This is probably my last time coming to this location.  On 3 different occasions as of late, unfortunately the staff refused to acknowledge me....it’s a shame because I’ve had good customer experiences here before too. I would not recommend this location; I’d go the extra distance for a guaranteed enjoyable experience.<//Review>

I walked it and they were serving someone, the girl behind the counter, didn't say a thing to me. After 15 minutes of waiting she said what do you need?
Also there was another girl working there but she was sitting , maybe she was on a break. But, they need to teach good customer service and/or good manners. Such rude service. Second time , I have been here and the same attitude.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

It is so hot inside. They don't have the AC turned on. I had to step outside and leave my friend in there. It is cooler outside than in that place. They have a large fan on, but no A.C. ridiculous. 7:34 p.m. on June June 22nd, 2019< /Review>

Love the idea and the growth of the culture. I was so glad to find a place like this. I ordered an elote thinking it would be like the street corn. I did get to add hot Cheetos which was cool. Giirrlll that corn is so SMALL! I was so shocked that there's no juicy bite to it??? I was like huh?? This thing was like 4 bucks. I'd wayyy rather buy it from the street. I've come to different micho locations but seems to be at all of them. I don't love the choice of corn they use. Maybe ill come here once in a while for ice cream. Prepare your wallet tho their a tad pricey</text>

<text>The service is horrible the employees don’t look excited or greet you with a welcoming vibe
ALSO the corn was almost $7 dollars and NOT warm which by the way an esquite should always be warm. Paid $30 for four Items which money never matters when it comes to food but you want to enjoy it
The small lemonade that I got was disgusting like the lemons were rotten
I was extremely disappointed I had the guy changed the drink which he did but he looked annoyed of me!
I rather drive to the far one from my house but that I know I will get attended well and welcoming I HOPE management talks to their employees about this for their own business can turn to success<//text><Time>1531412411377<//Time><resp>None<//resp><user_name>dalia madrigal</user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I'm going to give this place a 3 star rating because their stuff is great!! But they're service is a 2 star!! The staff is pretty slow and lady helping me had an attitude which was kind of uncalled for I definitely didnt give her attitude. 2 this place should be cool inside considering it's a ice cream parlor and its "premium" it was cooler outside than inside, it felt 80° horrible. 3. They used to have blinds that would allow customers to sit inside and enjoy their ice cream and such, now they're gone adding to the heat now you can barely open your eyes inside cause the sun sets as round 5 or whatever and that's when people start coming j  with their families. Once the line was almost out the door everyone looked hot and irritated lol it needs some upgrades like AC and some nicer workers< /Text>

got there looking for a diablito... asked them if they sold them. They said they did and I ordered one... next thing you know is you gotta ask for ICE CREAM in a diablito... they DO NOT know what a diablito is... it's like asking for birria at chipotle and they tell you they have it yet they give you barbacoa. JUST AS WHITEWASHED... never coming back to this place. Also I'd expect their employees to speak spanish... yeah no.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Of all the Michoacanas that I have visited, this branch has the best service and the best flavor in ice cream, I have been to others and the quality is not the same. I will return very soon for my favorite yogurt ice cream with granola and fruit that only in this branch I find

<Review>Nice folks! Very accommodating! I liked that they have you fill your bowl with meat and vegetables, and THEY'LL do your noodles and sauces - and they're VERY GENEROUS with BOTH! You get a HEAPING bowl of noodles, and TWO bowls of sauces as they cook! Very generous - and soy sauce is NOT NECESSARY when you sit down to eat! Wish I lived in the area -it'd definitely be a regularly-visited spot..!</Review>< Pics>

As a former UCR student (class of 2015 to be precise), I enjoyed eating at that restaurant.  The food is very tasty and you can pile up as much food as you can.  This restaurant would be a good place to take your friends or go out on a date.< /text>

<text>I love Mongolian BBQ but apparently this place has somehow escaped my notice for years.  I tried it as soon as I saw the sign and I’m glad I did.  The dining area is nice and clean, and there are at least 3 booths with electrical outlets for those of us needing to charge our devices.  There is also free guest WiFi.  The food was well cooked and tasted wonderful. You can adjust the level of spiciness by telling the cook.  The only drawback is variety of food items; I’ve been to Mongolian BBQ places with more choices, but those places have also been busier with a regular clientele, so they can afford to keep more items on hand without them going bad.  Also this place doesn’t offer an all-you-can-eat option, but once again, that makes more sense for a restaurant with heavier traffic.  Overall, I was satisfied with the large bowl I ordered for about $12, and after I was full I still had leftovers to take home.</text>< user_id>

Not worth it. First of all the plate and bowl were sticky as of it was not cleaned properly. Second the bowl makes it difficult to get all the meats and vegetables you want. Two bowls was about $25 but believe me it is not even worth half of that. Asked for extra spicy, it was spicy but other than that the flavor was very disappointing. On top of that I had a stomach ache the next morning.<//Text>

I absolutely love this place! You start out deciding if you want a regular or large bowl. You can also do combos which include a drink, rice, and miso soup. You go through the line decide how much meat and veggies you would like. If there’s something you’d like that doesn’t fit in your bowl you can always ask them to add it in for you. I usually do a mixture of the sauces they have. It is the perfect amount of spicy and other flavors (don’t let the oyster sauce stop you from getting it because once it’s all together it’s magic in your mouth). They cook it for you right away it doesn’t take very long! They always have great service and they are very kind people.< /text>

<Text>The best Mongolian I go to. I've been to many different Mongolian food places and the way they flavor the food and keep it nice and juicy makes me come back to the same one for a couple of years already. The people there are nice as well and I highly recommend coming here if you love Mongolian food.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<review>The place had all the amenities. Noodles were amazing. Buttt they just dont have that sauce thay you put on at the end like Great Khans. So I must say I will always go to GK. The worker who did my food was amazing. He loved his job, had good spirit and was down for my requests. Which I could have tipped him :/< /review><userid>118059577155509933442<//userid><Time>1595016124431<//Time><name>Kal El<//name>< Pictures>

The food is actually pretty good. I liked the sizes given too. The sauces are good. The staff was friendly. The cons? Kinda pricey and not the cleanest.</text>

Here I go again with my special diet needs. The cooks/greeters at this restaurant make you feel like family, even though the relationship lasts just a few minutes. I don't eat rice or noodles anymore, and they have NO problem with it and are happy to oblige. Delish!!<//Text>

Small bowl for toppings, kind of pricy for what's provided. Not sure if I can recommend it unless you're really wanting noodles but they do have other options like different styles of chicken they can prepare.<//text>

< Review>
The staff is friendly. Unfortunately, the food quality is not good. A couple of pieces of beef were spoiled. They automatically add noodles to your dish without asking (not good for people that are looking for low carb options). The restrooms were in horrible condition! We won't be returning.< /Review>

From out of town and just needed to grab a bite to eat.  I bumped into three regulars while I was there who commended me for finding the right place.  Food didn’t disappoint.
Also, I’m one of those “gluten intolerant” types that have become so common and they were really accommodating, making sure I got just as much food overall even without the noodles.</Text>< pictures>

<text>I am not a big fan, but it tastes really good go and try pineapple and bamboo they have in your noodles with beef and pork, surprisingly, I liked it.
To me putting those stuff together looked odd at first but turned out they are delicious.
Anyway, they aren’t a fancy restaurant, it’s self service and the place isn’t super clean.<//text><Rating>3<//Rating><Time>1447909095946</Time><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80dcae4751868625:0xd824be48b3447925< /gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><user>117689777249539525225</user><name>shakiba sadeghi<//name></record>

Expensive for volume of food. Woman yelled at me when I tried to push the bulky, rock solid frozen meat down so I could fit some vegetables with the food. Large bowl size is only about half a quart of food.  I bought a small fountain drink to get water while eating here. No refills allowed. This place is not generous at all. Not expecting them to make a deficit by any means, but at least allow your customers who are dining in to get refills on water...< /text>

Great place to eat. You serve your self as much as you can fit in a bowl and they make it right in front of you. the people are always happy to help.the parking spaces feels like they are limited because of the places around it.< /text>

This place is more 4.5 stars. I was so pleasantly surprised; what a neighborhood gem!!  Great service, excellent wine recommendations and the food..... soooooo good.

You will not be disappointed!  We had the warm spinach salad, the burrata bruschetta, the Maccarune Cu Salsiccia (baked rigatoni with Italian sausage) was a delight!  I also had the special that day which was a multi-hour ragu sauce over papperadelle. Yum.<//review>

If you've ever eaten at a real mongolian bbq, don't go here. Over priced terrible quality.  What's the deal with these noodles. Nasty. Only single serving.  And let me choose what sauce I want,  they dumped on everything without asking.

Does anyone know of a real mongolian bbq around here?< /text>

Captain of a class C tall ship embarking on a circumnavigation... Recently anchored in Santa Barbara and our Lofran windlass got stuck in the on position. No damage because I already had 200' of chain down but would have been disastrous had I only had 10' of chain down, could have taken down the masts! Called Danny at Sailing Supply and we determined that old solenoids were the issue. Danny personally drove to the location to pick up the parts and I received them within a day. Fixed the windlass today and ready to go! Perfect, couldn't have been better! Thanks Danny! Good to have a company like this to count on when needed.</Text>

If you own a sailboat, this is your place. If you're going cruising on a sailboat oh, this is really your place. It's a real boat store, not like West Marine which is a clothing fishing store. Nice knowledgeable people. They have a rig shop if you need it. Carry lots of line. Certainly have everything you need to rig a boat including winches,pulleys, traveler cars, sheet stoppers,  etc. This is a sister store to San Diego Marine Exchange.</Text>

Always helpful and wise advice with a big side helping of kindness and humor. If you have a boat problem of any kind they will either help you or make a good referral. Very trustworthy company. Good inventory and fair prices.</Review>

<Review>Do not purchase anything from Downwind Marine.  They sent me a defective pump and after I sent it back, they required me, the customer, to fight with them and the manufacturer to issue a refund.  I spent months emailing back and forth between Downwind Marine and the manufacturer/supplier and still haven't received a refund.  It's my understanding if you sell defective equipment to a customer, it's your responsibility to reimburse the customer, and then you can contact the manufacturer or supplier to pay you back for the refund.  The manufacturers don't deal with your customer, that's why they have you, the distributor.  Until I receive my refund this negative post stays up.  Don't buy anything from Downwind Marine.< /Review>< pics>

Most friendly ppl on all of shelter island. Love these guys very very sailor savy and great abundance and wealth of knowledge on sailing and repairs too. They're not just out to pressure ya to make a quick cash sale. They truly just want to make sailors happy and safe. Not just get $$ frm us. All stores should be run like this in this country.

<Review>NEVER write reviews but this was an all around horrible experience. I went in for a tune up. Everyone was super kind and knowledgeable. Two tubes replaced told didn't need new tires and had brake pad replaced. I ride apx 10 miles a day so its important that my bike work properly. A couple of days later I went in for another flat tire (thorn in tire). Different guy told me I needed new tires because mine were worn out. I only got one new tire due to financial hardship from COVID + labor cost. A couple days later the chain started making noise that wasnt normal. Brought it in, guy said it was put on too tight (from when they replaced the tire). He loosened it and said it was fine. Took it out and it was making the same noise. About mile 5 into my ride I got a flat (NOT their fault). I came back in to get a new tire (4th visit). I said that I needed a new tire and that it was still making that noise. Looked at it, told me my chain was dry and I should get a new one but this would last a couple of months. Them greasing it was 5 new chain was 13. Told them to replace it. I had JUST been in maybe 3 hours prior about the chain and was told everything was fine. Told the older gentleman I'd been there 4 times and he said "I told you to change the tire." I had explained that it was the chain. Didnt take me seriously. What could have been 50 dollars (in total) turned into well over 100. Be careful and do your research before going here.<//Review>< pictures>

And they said I had to buy the oil for $7.99
They got greedy they used to be a nice shop

Can't test ride the bicycles. I went in looking to check out some bicycles, but they don't let you test ride any of the bikes because then they won't be "new" anymore. I've never had this issue at any other bike shop.

Otherwise, it seemed like they had cool things and friendly staff, just the no test ride policy got me annoyed.<//review>

Quick, quality service and really affordable. Changed a tube in minutes.  One star deduction is only because parking is limited to street parking, so i had to drive around several times and eventually just parked a bit away. That is likely mitigated by going at certain times of the day that aren't as busy.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>This shop sold me a defective tube for my tire.  It would not hold air.  When i called them the manager stated that they would not refund this because it would be impossible to determine if i did the damage or the item was defective.  I called them only 45 min. After my purchase.  It was kind of offensive that they would imply that i was trying to cheat them out of $3.50.  The lady I spoke to on the phone was quite rude.  Anyways, there are plenty of bike shops in the area.  No need to go to this one.  I will never go back!< /Text>< Pics>

Great shop, prices are very appealing, got some tires there and also tubes - cheapest I saw, and I've been to like 8 other bike shops. Don't forget they're closed on Tuesdays!<//text>

Older lady wearing a hat greeted us by telling us they close in fifteen minutes and made similar comments to others that walked in after. Then after asking for a different size on a shirt, they tell me they had one in the back but couldn’t sell it to me! One star because at least they referred me to a better Boot Barn.

Thank you, Rocklin store for your help!</Text></record>

I’ve been to the bootbarn in Rocklin, Chico, Elk Grove, and Yuba City. Ive never had an issue besides YC bootbarn. If you’re not customer service friendly find a different job opportunity where you don’t have to consistently interact with customers. Everytime I go in to this store the same elder white lady has an attitude that not even she can stand herself. Really wish I would’ve caught her name I just remember her having her dark hair tied up with bangs, SUPER UNHELPFUL. As for all other staff super friendly and apologetic for the inconvenience of that employee.<//Text>

I walked in there to pick up some boots my brother had reserved and as soon as I walked in I walked over to the cash register where about 8 employees were standing and they all just stared at me for a good while. Not a single one engaged me or even welcomed me to their lovely store. They finally said something to me once I said hi and once they finished staring at me. They weren't friendly AT ALL. I found it quite curious though that when I saw other customers walk in they were greeted with a hello or even told to have a nice night. We live in a multicultural community and it is really sad when it is apparent what people disapprove of this. If you can't deal with someone looking differently than you then you really shouldn't work in a customer service section of our community.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I bought a pair of $200 dollar work boots here. I work 12 hours per day in these boots. Needless to say keeping my feet well is important to me, as I cannot work without my feet in good shape. About a week into owning these boots, they started to hurt my feet. Only one hurt my feet so i thought maybe there was something wrong with the boot. I called to ask if there was something they could do and without looking at the boots, they said they could not help me because there was no manufacturer defect. How could they know that without even looking at the boots? Im pretty sure they can just call "no manufacturer defect" and keep your.money and leave you with boots that hurt your feet. If my $200 keeps others from losing money to these thieves it was money well spent.</review>< Pics>

<user>109521212712368838364< /user>< Review>
My husband purchased a pair of nicely priced boots about a week ago, he was told by one of the employees that if he had any issues breaking them in he could take them back for exchange or refund. Today we went in to exchange for a wider size since he wore them and they were still very stiff and tight! which also made sores on his calves! As we approach the counter to do the exchange the mature colored eye woman with dark hair&blonde highlights was at the register, very aggressively questions my husband why he grabs the same size in boot if the other pair  was tight, mind you this woman had not even checked the new boot size to ask this question!!! She looks at him and tells him "BECAUSE YOU WORE THESE BOOTS AND DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT SIZE, NOW I HAVE TO EAT THESE  OVER $200 BOOTS!!" Obviously my husband went a size wider, after she checks them she toned it down and said oh yes it makes sense to go wider!!! Very Rudeee to begin with!!! if you can't deliver good customer service and refunds or exchanges please don't promote them!</Review>

Its pretty annoying to show up at 1045 when the the hours on here say they are open at 10 only to find out the doors are locked and the sign on the door says they open at 11.<//Text>

So by the third time they required us to start from scratch and basically get married again, this is 4 years later by the way. And yes, we had to pay again. So $300 and 4 years later we finally have our official marriage certificate. Screw you California government.</Text></record>

<Date>1583877152812</Date><review>Once i walked in, seeing it is not a huge over crowded chaotic building that i have come accustom with, was a relief.  The security guard is attentive,  keeping the line assemble in a orderly manner and taking notice of what people needed to do, for why they were there, before they end up standing in line to long. He was quick on task, very helpful and straight forward.  My sorrows of the unexpected death of my deaf daughter was reason why I was even there, thank you for making a necessary task thats basically simple in everyday life, but i  was barely getting by.  That help and the quick flow of handling of the people, deserves a 10 plus.  And would like to add,  The lady at the counter was very kind and no rudeness that I've experienced in other districts in  government buildings from stressed workers, such as the DMV, so thank you very much for being respectful and not rude at all, or up tight.< /review>< Gmap_id>

I’m so angry right now, the website says that it is open I drive an hour and a half away and I get here to a sign that says closed until further notice. They should at least keep their website updated</Text>

<review>I was dreading having to deal with a government office to get a copy of my daughter's birth certificate.  When I walked in I was greeted by a security guard who asked if I'd filled out my paperwork online.  I had so he lead me directly to a clerk who took care of my paperwork while engaging me in a pleasant conversation.  I was in there less than five minutes.  I was pleasantly surprised as you can imagine.  The office was bright, clean and the employees friendly and competent.  It was hard to believe I was a in county government office.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c25ad8027d1567:0xa4603fb80b60a5ee</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It was amazing smooth sailing to pick up my records here, I was prepared for the hassle that comes from most government offices, but the gentleman at the door was a great help, and when I needed clarification, he didn't make me feel foolish. The lady at the window was very professional and quick, I was in and out in 15 minutes. Good job.</Review>

People are nice but the policies are lame. Don’t believe the hours of operation because they stop servicing certain items WAY before the times listed on their website and their door. I now have to take another day off early from work... -__-<//Review>

Given that you have a plan of action before you step into a government office this office os well equipped and well staffed. The staff is very helpful and informative. I am certain if you treat them as other human beings and not a governing entity they will exceed your wants and expectations.<//review>

The absolute worse customer service I've ever had. I have been there 3 times in the last week and its been the same experience every time. First, the security guard who works there is beyond rude and very loud about it, making you feel like a fool. Then the lady at the window gives a smug face the entire time, as if she hates her job and doesn't want to be there and gives attitude every time you talk. If I could avoid going here I would!</Text>

< review>
I highly appreciated your nice and fast services at the counter.  However, I had to move 2 hours away after I requested for my certificate. I asked whether I can call in advance to check if my certificate is avilable for pick up or not and they gave me a number. Six weeks later I call 3-4 times a day for 5 days. Nobody pick up the phone..... cannot leave a msg..... no call back....cannot check online..... finally I have to drive 4 hours total just to know that my certificate was not yet available. Feel like living in a 3rd world country.< /review>

If you have ANY complaints about this office just visit the one in Van Nuys and I'm sure you will QUICKLY thank God for the ladies in the Lancaster District Office. No one is perfect! But, I drove 45 mins PASS the Van Nuys office to get to Lancaster. GREAT SERVICE...quick, professional, and quick. Did I say it was quick?</Text>

Horrible service. Made an appt for 11:30 and was told the person to help me has "gone to lunch." So I get to wait here for a half hour for her when I should have been in and out. Worst business ever! The security guard doesn't care either, he totally shrugged it off like he's not wasting anyone's time.<//Review>

The office it's self was nice, but the customer service is pretty bad. There was a rude security guard who was friendly with certain people and not others. If not for him, I would give the building a higher rating.<//Review>

I've worked with River Drive Properties for nearly a year and I am extremely content with their service. It was my first time renting out my property, and Joseph, with the help of his team, made me feel comfortable with the entire process. Anytime I had a question, they were quick and thorough with their responses. I also appreciated how their owner portal has all the payment information as well as any receipts from work they need to do. They are transparent, honest, and quick with listing your properties. I would definitely recommend their services.</text>

River Drive is managing our property for 2+ years now and do a marvelous job. We never worried about the home since they regularly would check our place, keep us up to date and always felt informed. The staffs are highly responsive, knowledgeable, and very friendly. I highly recommend working with Joseph cox for any escalations who cares about the service he delivers. Dont think twice...try River Drive Properties and see for yourself! They are the best in central valley!.< /review>

I left the premises of my resident on May 31, 2021. I have not heard anything about my deposit. They say it takes twenty one days to return. Since then, I have not heard anything about it. I did get an estimate of what they think it'll cost for a light clean up and a door. Since then, my deposit did in limbo. I went in and asked, they said it's just an estimate. No action has been taken to return my deposit. Thinking of getting a lawyer involved. Will call on Monday to see what I'm told again. If nothing, I'll take legal action then.<//review>

River Drive Properties is the BEST property management company I have ever used. The other ones were extremely unresponsive and unprofessional. This company returns calls on a timely manner, gives you updates on your property, and on CA situations for the landlords and tenants...they do not skip a beat and I would recommend them to all who are in need of a property management. I am so happy they opened an office in Fresno.<//Text>

Joseph and his team are amazing people! Professional, timely, flexible, approachable and at the same time makes you feel like your property is in good family hands. Joseph is smart and very knowledgeable on market. I was looking for property management for my first rental property. I found them through my neighbors and they highly recommended Joseph and his team. After I met Joseph he gave me peace of mind and felt like I found the right person and team for my property! He immediately came up with all strategies to market the house. He took ownership in any request made to him and his team. Joseph takes time to understand our needs, concern,  provides reality check and right advice and does timely search with thorough check on tenants to find perfect match without compromising on risk factors in time pressed situation. Even in the tough time, Joseph managed to find tenants for our property. I wrote few qualities and they well deserve it all! Highly recommend Joseph and his team! Thank you Joseph and River Drive Properties! I felt well taken care and found good friend in new place!<//text>

The team at River Drive continue to provide great service to manage our rental properties.  They give clear guidance on market rental conditions, notify of us of any property issues and are always timely in monthly reporting and payments.  I would highly recommend them as I have had a relationship with them for several years.</review>

I have been very pleased to work with River Drive Properties since August, 2018. Joseph is a good PM. He responses to my concern and request in time. He provides proper suggestion to my for my rental property in Merced. The management fee is reasonable. The time from my first tenant moving out to the next one moving in is only 12 days. The rent was even higher than what I expected. I feel totally hassle free with this company. They do all things in professional ways.

Thank you, River Drive Property. Thank you, Joseph.</Review>

<review>River Drive Properties is one of the best company for property management hands down. Their work ethic and knowledge in this field is excellent. As a home owner you want to be able to trust who you're handing over your home to. You're trusting a company to choose your tenant for home, collect rent, inspect the home, and handle/coordinate any repairs. I give River Drive Properties my full endorsement on the home renting process.<//review>< Response>

We have known Joseph and his team for a little less than a year and have been very pleased with their services.  Joseph always responds with a clear and straight answer.  As mentioned in another comment, their fees are fair and no hidden expenses.  Since we are not local to Merced, we needed to find a property management company that is honest, transparent, and straightforward.  We found this in River Drive Properties.  Thank you guys.< /review>< pictures>

The River Drive Properties has managed my rental property in Merced for more than 3 years. I am very satisfied with their service. Specially, Mr. Joseph Cox is very nice, friendly, patiently, and professional. He always answers and replies my questions promptly.

Joseph, Denise and staff have always been professional in working with me and my properties. They work well with my tenants and my owner payments are timely. My properties are in good hands with River Drive Properties. I have recommended them to people seeking housing and to other landlords.< /Review>

I switched to River Drive Management a year ago. I own many rental homes in Merced. Every other company I tried, offered poor customer service and non-transparent fees.
I met with Joseph and knew immediately, this was the company for me. They treat the tenants with respect and care and they always respond to questions promptly. The management fee is fair and they do not have any hidden fees. The return on my investment has increased over 40% under their keen management skills. I could not ask for more from a management company.
Whether you are a tenant or property owner, you owe it to yourself to give them a try.
I want to publicly thank Joseph and the team for doing such an outstanding job.<//text>

< Review>
Update: 10/15/2020
Regardless whether the best of time or the worst of time, Joseph and his team at River Drive Properties always comes through.  The pandemic has let us experience the very real global disruption, but as an investor I can never thanks the team enough for taking care of tenant moving out, inspections and find a new family to move in including service request in less than 2 weeks.

And as to tenant who's looking for top notch inventory and service, after years of working together with Joe all I can say is he and his team still carry the same attitude of dedication with kindness and caring personality.  River Drive Properties is and always be the best management to Merced CA.

---------------------------------------

Whether you’re looking for place to call home with range of monthly expenses or someone you can trust to manage your investment with cost effectiveness, you have found one.

Joseph has reputation for standard of excellence, local knowledge and extensive experience.  This is not to mention his dedication with kindness and caring personality.

Bottom line; After much research before I decided to do business with, on who has the best inventory and pool of clients/waiting list.   Decisively, I have to give Joe and River Drive Properties being the best Management in Merced, hands down.

Joseph, you’re the best!< /Review>

<text>I've looked at many property management companies in Merced County and River Drive Properties is by far the easiest and most efficient found!! As a newer landlord, it can be stressful, with everything that needs to be taken care of. Joseph and Bryanna take care of things very quickly and are always friendly and understanding. They make things very easy from start to finish.  Joseph is an exceptional property manager. I'm very happy I chose River Drive Properties!!< /text>< pictures>

I first became aware of this company when I was relocating here for a position at UC Merced. I was looking for a rental home and I was getting nowhere with management companies. I would ask if the home was available, they would tell me it was, I would complete an application at that moment then I was told the house was rented to someone else. I became frustrated and was ready to stay in a hotel for 6 months. Then I called River Drive Properties. Denise took the time to assist me and I rented a very nice home in North Merced. I also own several rental properties in Northern California and the great service and wonderful living experience that first made me a tenant grew into me becoming a client. They now manage my properties and I could not be happier with the wonderful service I receive! Whether renting or looking for management, the best decision is to work with River Drive Properties.< /text>

I call them in January to ask where it is and get that answer they didn’t even bother to reach out to me! Here I am at the END of April, it arrives and I walk in store to schedule my delivery. At the time of scheduling NOTHING was on the schedule. Boom 1-3 on Wednesday. Clear out and clean/sanitize my whole bedroom and then... Girl at the store just called it’s almost 2pm now to tell me they’re short staffed and their only truck is in yuba city!? Not my problem! I told them to keep their stuff if I can’t get it today.

I adore these people! I had a house turned into a home in record time. They are so kind to fire victims. I was treated like family. We love our furniture and appliances. I would give them a 20 if I could. Don't hesitate to buy from here.<//text>

<Text>I fell in love with a bedroom set and decided to buy it. The employees were very rude especially kayley. In addition when the furniture was delivered it was used and floor model mattress instead of the new merchandise that I purchased. They tried to swap me and make me pay full price for a used item. Needless to say I will be getting a refund and will never use this place again. Bad business as well as shady practices.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This place isn't Worth the time, cause Rent A Center doesn't give your money back on returned products...
They aren't worth even one star, but had to or i couldn't rate the service
Plus tax rents our broken furniture I bought a bed and 3 weeks time it broke they are very dishonest store.
Please don't buy anything from rac.<//Review>

<Text>Been a patient for close to 10 years. It is a well run professional organization with the very latest technological equipment.
I've been a patient of both Dr. Ted Pasquale and Dr. Carl Hartman. They are two of the best medical professionals I have dealt with in my 78 years. I always trusted their skills and advice and felt in safe hands at all times.
Also, I might add that the many assistants were polite and efficient</Text>< Resp>

<Name>Nick Ritter< /Name><text>I recently received a painless operation to remove a cataract from my left eye, and my recovery has already exceeded my expectations.  SoCal Eye provided this service for me on my right eye about three years ago, as it seemed to be the weakest of my set at the time.  My vision improved with that action, though I could still detect a color difference between them.  Now everything is much brighter, and I can read the disclaimer small print on all the tv drug ads.  And on today's bike ride, I spotted two dollar bills lurking at the curb.  Things are looking up, so to speak.</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This clinic appears to have issues with over booking. My appointment was at 2:30, but I didn’t see a doctor until 4:30. And two hours of that time was spent in the waiting room! - Not exaggerating. The doctor and staff are very pleasant and professional, but I only got to see the doctor for maybe 5 minutes, maybe it was 7 minutes. The medical technician was awesome. But I was told by the staff that I would be fine to drive after my eyes were dialated. Yes I could drive but I couldn’t see the signs and exits! This was terrible advice. I should have arranged a transport. It’s true that their technology looks modern, and the team seemed highly qualified. I question the integrity of the owners. The over scheduling looks like greed.</review>

She calmed me down since my fears of coming in when the cases were climbing. Dr. Clay also was calm and understanding. She explained everything I needed to know and was also fast and efficient.

<text>Positive aspects: My eye doctor was attentive, explained things well and made me feel confident that I was treated properly.
Annoying and poor aspects: Having an initial intake conversation by phone, 2 weeks before my appointment, where the receptionist completely screwed up my insurance information. I was called by a second person 30 mins before I had to leave for the actual appointment  to take my insurance info all over again. She couldn't explain the insurance info that was on my chart and suggested that I might not want to drive there in case they didn't take my insurance. All they had to do was call the phone number on my insurance card and get the proper info in 5 mins or less. Once I had the appointment the Optometric exam was covered. But  then they wouldn't accept my insurance for the lenses. Finally, the office was run down, the entrance to the building is poorly marked,  and I would prefer to find another optometric resource for future exams.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Excellent experience at So cal eye. This place and the staff makes you feel at total ease with your visit and what ever procedure your having. They make sure you have NO questions after their explanations and assure you that you will be fine. I personally chose Dr. Clay and she makes me feel comfortable and happy to have my procedure done. I would highly recommend So cal eye care to anyone needing service for your eyeballs.<//Text>

< Review>
Dr. Hartmann, Dosha and Juan were wonderful. They were very professional while making me feel comfortable. Communicated with me very well. The issue I had was with the wait time and the front desk staff. My appointment was at 1000 but I wasn’t brought back until 1045. After my appointment I was waiting to schedule my follow up. While my chart was on the counter the front desk staff was doing something else, calling patients to schedule appointments. I had to go to the desk to ask how much longer just to make an appointment. I was apologized to and an appointment was made. Hopefully the wait time isn’t as long the next time because I really like Dr. Hartmann and the clinical staff. The front desk may benefit from a review of their process to stream line the work flow.<//Review>

<text>I give SoCal Eye my highest recommendation.  My husband got some sap in his eye from a pencil cactus.  He was in extreme pain.  SoCal Eye was able to get him in almost immediately to see a doctor.  Dr. Ling was outstanding. He was extremely professional and knew exactly what to do.  His eye felt so much better after seeing the doctor.

My husband did have to visit SoCal Eye one time before about a year ago when he got some saw dust in his eyes even though he was wearing safety glasses.  So this is his SECOND time visiting SoCal Eye.  Both times they got him in right away and provided outstanding care.<//text>< Pictures>

Each employee with whom I came in contact was very courteous and friendly. Gillian, who performed the necessary tests  was very patient and informative in answering my questions and explaining what was being done. Dr. Clay set me at ease and explained what the future cataract surgery would entail. Her assistant Maria was very friendly and professional. Just a follow-up - just had my second visit yesterday for measurements prior to cataract surgery, again a different member of the team, but the same level of efficiency and professionalism!!!< /Review>

I had my annual appointment with Dr Nhu on the 19th. In spite of the restrictions due to COVID, the check in and short wait were handled smoothly. Leslie took care of all my prep and was friendly and efficient. Very good at communicating all of the procedures as we went along.
Dr Nhu , as always was thorough and explained all of the changes and Recommendations for the ensuing year.
All in all a very comfortable, successful morning.</Review>

Interesting experience as my encounter with my Dr was amazing. Smart and extremely knowledgeable on my situation. My only problem was arriving early and not being seen 45 min after my appointment time. Seemed like the girls in the back were more worried about drama and their nails then anything else. Getting attitude when walking up to counter was most interesting as it seemed like I was bothering her to do her job. Either way the Dr was amazing and provided me with amazing care. The Technician also was on point and explained everything in knowledgeable detail. Think I have to find a new office as I highly doubt losing me will be a big deal.< /review>

I had an emergency and they did a thorough and professional assessment of what was wrong with me. They then referred me to a specialist which they set up for me in office. I couldn’t have asked for anything more in an urgent situation. Many thanks to the staff and Dr. P. (I am the wife of this person’s account- just to be accurate)<//review>

Excellent first visit. I actually came a day early by mistake , however they were able to slide me into an available slot. After a short wait, a delightful man named Mario called me back for my history and preliminary testing. A+ for patient care.

Dr. Larry Pasquali , the Opthalmologist, was fantastic. He went over my medical history with me, performed an exam and explained in detail the results. He gave me a chance more than once to ask questions. It was nice not to be rushed. I also applaud Dr Pasquali for being thorough with my medication and medical histories.

I appreciated his thoroughness more than I can say. I've visited a number of practitioners over the years who made it obvious with their questions that they did not even give the forms I'd filled out a cursory glance.

I would highly recommend this office for your eye care needs.< /Text>

The entire SoCalEye team is terrific.  This was my first visit to their Lakewood location.  New faces but still that same friendly demeanor that I am used to with their Katella crew.   Marco, the technician, was a true gentleman and he explained everything he was going throughout the preliminary examination.   I not only got my eyes examined but I learned some new things in the process.   Dr. Pascuali is THE BEST.</Text>

First of all, I didn't have to wait long at all even withCorona-19 going on. Everyone had to wear a face mask while all their chairs in the waiting room were carefully spaced out.

I was called into a room where their equipment was. The main assistant took my medical history, prescriptions taken and  all entered into her computer while explaining all to her intern assistant.

We went to another room where a more modernistic machine to take pictures of the back of my eyes - because I have Type2 Diabetes and
they wanted to make sure that I don't have diabetic damage.

I felt comfortable the whole time I was there. Two thumbs up for my main assistant for her knowledge and ease of caring not only for the patient, but for her love of the optical field.

Forgive me for forgetting to bring my bifocals and written prescriptions/medical history.

Thank you all,

<review>Fantastic office for eye exams as well as urgent eye problems! Staff was the utmost  friendly kind from the front doorman to the doctor doing the exam with his assistant. There was a training in process with a new hire & the trainer was the most professional & patient with the trainee. I would want to train here as an eye professional! This particular day I had a lot of appointments where one was for my dog where I had to bring him along for the trip and the staff was so kind & ok with my dog being there. SoCal Eye you are doing a FANTASTIC job! Keep it up!<//review>< Date>

Amazing staff and quick service! Only reason it isn't 5 stars is I didn't receive my PD! I live far from the office and now I can't order eyewear online because this wasn't given... I hope they start to give everyone their PD on their Rx!<//review>

It should've been explained that the PD is not normally part of a glasses prescription since the measurement is taken upon ordering glasses - at our practice and at many others. Even if you aren't ordering your glasses with us, our optical department would be happy to assist you with that measurement. If there is anything else we can do for you, please don't hesitate to contact us.\n-The SoCal Eye Team"}</resp>

< Review>
I have been a patient at SoCal Eye Physicians for a few years now. I was diagnosed with an acute angle closure on my right eye back in 2012. Dr. Hartman was able to perform an iridectomy successfully. After a few weeks, I didn’t have to take Latanoprost anymore.

I came back under this medical group’s care a few years ago for my annual eye check ups. Dr. Kwok is a wonderful and well informed optometrist. He always checks the pressure in my eye to ensure that the acute angle closure doesn’t occur again.

The other staff are very professional, too. Whenever I call to make an appointment or reschedule, they are always accommodating and helpful.

Thank you, SoCal Eye Physicians and staff, for your assistance!< /Review>

<text>Everyone is friendly and well educated in what they do and how to explain everything to me. My surgery of my right eye was a success and I'm looking forward to having my left done next month. I highly recommend this group of doctors and nurses. They put me right at ease. You'll be in good hands. THANK YOU to all who made me your top priority. God Bless You.

I had my left eye done before the pandemic. It went great. I highly recommend them. Now I have to wait to see my eye doctor for new glasses.</text>< Resp>

After my early arrival for my eye doctor's appointment, I flipped through the latest magazines and reviewed the most recent medical advancements as I also, calmed myself for a very pleasant eye exam. Everyone who greeted and assisted me were excellent to work with.
In addition the doctor and the staff were very pleasant and displayed their excellent knowledge in a very professional manner. I was quite impressed.

Thanks for helping me.

Be blessed,

This office is so impersonal.  The front staff treat people as if they were automatons.  They are also condescending. After reopening with the pandemic still here, the office staff has been replaced by a "call center" which seems far worse for making an appointment and communication than before.  It seems as if the group that has the business is just  interested in not creating clear communication, but about money and expediency and could care "less" about their patients.<//Review>

The hospital staff treated me respectfully and explained in detail how my eyes are. They told me to come back in one year.  There is a beginning of cataract but not to worry about it now because as the doctor said it will take a long time but they will keep checking it.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Most appointments are very good and happy people.  This was the same. I had my meds on the counter and Dr asked about refills and I said yes and he said we'll submit for everything to be refilled.  When I went to pharmacy to pick up, I was missing two and they showed me the request from the Dr's office and the two missing weren't ordered.  Now I have to call Dr's office and go back to pharmacy to pick up the two missing prescriptions.  With Covid-19 I'm at an age I don't got out any more than necessary and this 2nd trip shouldn't be necessary!

A truly first time amazing experience .  I was concerned because the office looked big and there were eight ophthalmologist there +3 optometrist .  I was also nervous about having the cataracts in my eyes looked at .  The front desk was warm and welcoming and sweet and made me feel so comfortable .  After a short 10 minute wait for my appointment time I got called into a room .  Tim the ophthalmologist technician made me feel so comfortable he performed all the tests that needed to be done spent plenty of time chatting with me reassuring me that everything was good so far .  Then Dr. Ling  came in and continued with my eye exam looked at my cataracts and told me at this point they were mild to moderate I’d be able to pass my eye exam for my drivers license and not to worry until I had some symptoms and that he’d see me next year .   He also was kind and informative and took the time to make me feel comfortable .   I’ll be back thank you 😘<//Text>

The doctors are really nice and know their business. The only problem I had was scheduling a follow up appointment. They are booked months in advance, so if you have a follow up appointment to get contacts and require a doctor to see you before you can get them, it's really difficult to find a time that's convenient.<//Review>

<Text>Recently, I underwent two cataract surgeries, one on each eye, at SoCal Eye Lakewood. Before the first surgery I was beyond scared. The nurses, the Anesthesiologist, and Dr. Emma Clay all helped to alleviate my fears. They were all professional, skilled, kind - a great team. Knowing what to expect the second time around, I felt more relaxed going into surgery. Once again, I was impressed by the skill of the team. They moved through an assembly line of sorts, operating on several people in one day, but still they took time to treat each one of us with skill and importance. Thank you Dr. Clay for doing an excellent surgery on both my eyes. Thank you Dr. Anesthesiologist for your kind manner in helping to calm me. Thank you Team for each part you played in my most successful outcome!<//Text>< user_name>

Was disappointed I didn't get to see my Dr.Clay as I thought my app. was to be with her
But all went o.k.  I did have a pretty long wait  to see the Dr.< /review>

My 80 year father had the most abysmal encounter with staff members and Dr. Jastad. DO,  1/29/2020, he came in for an office visit; Staff contacted me at 2:16pm to inform me that he needed to have URGENT surgery at 7am  due to his eye being open and Authorization was needed immediately. At 5:17pm Dr. Jarstad reaches out to me to explain auth was not approved yet  and his surgery would be moved to 11am instead of 7am.  1/30/2020 at 9/29/2020 auth was approved office staff indicated needed to go to surgical center prior to 10:30am.. We arrived and checked in on TIME.. At 10:38am staff informed us that surgery has to be cancelled because Dr. Jarstad had office patients to see..  We were giving NO RECOURSE for how move forward..  We had to go to EMERGENCY room to have URGENT procedure completed to save his vision. Mind you he fasted for OVER 24hrs.

This is the MOST NEGLECTFUL AND INCOMPETENT OFFICE!!!!<//review>

When I required evaluation and possible treatment of my eyes, I was impressed with the promptness of service I received and the friendly courtesy of care.  The high degree of education and certification of the doctors and assistants was impressive.

The large number of styles of glasses gave me a good set of choices of a pair for myself. The courtesy and friendliness of the staff was refreshing and appreciated.  I really enjoy my improved focus of reading and distant vision.</Text>

< review>
Dr. Carl Hartman gave me a wonderful gift on March 25, 2014. It was the gift of clear vision by performing an amazing 12-minute cataract surgery. After the surgery I went out to dinner with  my husband! Besides his skill, one of the reasons it was amazing is because he gave me "mono vision" so I do not have to use reading glasses anymore! Now I can clearly see when reading books, computers, menus, art work, sculpting, and looking at labels for the best products! And I am writing this review the day after surgery! He said it will get better over the next three weeks. Not only that but I wish I had learned about him two years ago and had him correct my left eye cataract because I know I would have had better results. He is skilled, professional, and enjoyable. Two weeks before my right eye surgery he performed a laser treatment in my left eye. Now I can see so clearly that I sincerely feel like it's a miracle. I should mention that while waiting for my surgery the people next to me came all the way from San Joaquin Valley (300 miles away) to have Dr. Carl Hartman do their surgery. Impressive!< /review>

I've been a patient at Lakewood Eye Physicians since 1990. From my 1st visit to my appointment last week, I've been treated like I'm truly special. Dr Ronald Hartman is my physician, he's super nice, very knowledgeable & funny. He's been treating my glaucoma since 1990 & told me I'm making him work too hard, with contagious laughter, because it's taken many combination of medications to keep my eye pressure at bay. The staff is so nice. They go the extra mile to make sure everything is understood & I don't usually wait very long in the examination room, which I so appreciate. If you don't have an eye doctor, I strongly recommend Lakewood Eye Physicians, newly named Southern California Eye Physicians & Associates. I love these people!<//text>

Very professional, warm and friendly. The wait was reasonable, I was impressed.
Professionalism seems to be a thing of the past. The office staff was apologetic (the space is much to small) about the cramped surroundings. It was a pleasant experience.
Thank you.< /text>

< Review>
This clinic is great!   My 15 year old daughter had an emergency and had a contact stuck in her right eye.  Dr. Pasquali was so kind and so patient with her.  He tried for at least 60 minutes to help her get it out and she was in so much pain she wouldn't allow him to get it.   He spoke so nicely to her in order to keep her calm which I truly appreciated.   In the end she had to be sedated in order to get it removed and the surgical staff was just as amazing. They all spoke to her very sweetly as she was scared to death.   They talked her though the IV and made her feel extremely comfortable in a very stressful situation.    I highly recommend this clinic and appreciate their kindness in a very scary situation for my daughter.< /Review>

<text>We can't put a price tag on our eye sight. And when we discover a problem with our vision, we want to know we are receiving the best care. And, not only that, but we may need some hand holding in this frightening situation. I found all of that at SOCAL EYE Long Beach, Ca. I am so grateful for each person who works there because they take care of me as though I am a member of their family.
My doctor recommended them & I am extremely grateful he did. Thank you so much SOCAL EYE.<//text>< UserId.>

<Text>Dr. Carl Hartman is a miracle worker.One month ago he implanted a lense in my left eye (cataract surgery),changed my distance vision from very poor to an outstanding 20/25,almost a perfect 20/20,beyond my wildest expectations; i had been very nearsighted all my life;imagine my unending elation for being glasses or contact lenses-free at this advanced stage of my life. He also worked around scars on my cornea that intensive RK had produced almost 30 years ago; and also,decided against using a more expensive type of lense (for which i would have paid myself),the results proving him absolutely right.I had suspected that the results were going to very good,given the massive pre-surgery preparations that i went trough.My eternal gratitude to you,Dr. Carl, and to everybody in your beautiful staff. God bless you all.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< gmapID>
