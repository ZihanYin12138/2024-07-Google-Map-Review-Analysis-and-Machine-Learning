I got my haircut today and I love it. It is easy to make an appointment online and the people are professional. Dan is such an amazing barber, and I highly recommend him. He is patient, highly skilled, and willing to work with you. I showed him a picture of the haircut I wanted and he nailed it! He's like a surgeon but for hair! I am always going to get my haircut here its great!!</Text>

My son needed a haircut last second before going out of state to mommas... who you gonna call? True account, true story.

I was finishing my service at Mercedes hanging out with my son around Etnies park and thought while grabbing a bite at flame broiler this is a nice looking shop 💈. Glad to meet Kent, he took good care of me and definitely am grateful humble and blessed. Thanks guys!!!<//text>

It was great to get back to V's for a much needed haircut after almost 3 months. I felt very safe & comfortable with everyone practicing social distancing & wearing masks. Plastic partitions separated just stations & barbers all wore masks & some wore shields. Very thankful they have reopened.< /review>

After being closed for the virus, I visited on Friday for a haircut with Dan, and would continue to highly recommend this barbershop! They have all the required protocols in place, but that only detracted slightly to the great overall experience and service typical of this establishment!</Review>

< Review>
This barbershop has a classic old world feel  with a sports theme that caters to guys. You'll be offerred a water or beer, and there are individual televisions at each station if you want to watch something. No ungodly chemical stink when you walk in thank goodness, one of my pet peeves.

I've had several barbers here, my favorite is Hamid, who always does an excellent job. The real selling point though is that my wife says Hamid cuts my hair better than anyone ever has. That's the best endorsement I can think of. You can expect a bit of pampering here, hot towels, short massage, etc. but this is still a barbershop and not a salon. I like that.

They do offer shaves and such that I haven't taken advantage of yet, maybe I will at some point.

The owner is usually present who mans the front end. He's personable enough and it's nice to see he cares to  keep a watch over his business.

Bottom line: great place for a cut, and try Hamid😊< /Review>

Stanley did a great job - lots and lots of hair accumulated during the virus shut-down.

Great job with health measures and hopefully this will all be behind us in a couple more months.< /review>

Each station is partitioned off with sheets of plastic, hand sanitizer required for each patron, each barber and clients have their temperature taken. Masks were required. Definitely very cautious and following all CDC guidelines, Plus a great haircut. Thanks Napo.< /text>

<Review>Dan was great as always and provides the best clipper cut fade in the OC.   Kent is the friendliest and hardest working owner/operator you will find. Kent also supports the community.

I would highly recommend this V's location, Dan and Kent.

Don't ever get a hair cut from Stuart. I should've known better when I walked in when he was the only one without a customer. Sitting on his phone while I'm sitting in his chair waiting for him to cut my hair. The only request I had was "2 on he sides. Scissors on top." Simple right? He literally grabs the clippers and starts buzzing the top of my hair. I was literally speechless. I had two simple requests. And with his careless attitude, I would never recommend him. You pay more to get at least decent customer service here and you don't get that with him. I would recommend jay if you go in. He  actually does a great job. Beware of Stuart!!</review>

<review>I switched to Vs from sport clips a few months ago, they had been decent at doing my normal haircut, but I asked to show the man a 30 second video of a new one I was trying to get. The barber was not to stoked on watching a video, 5 seconds into it he said he’s got it and then proceeded to butcher my hair, he did nothing right. They have lost my business< /review>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><text>There is something to be said about someone who takes their job and in this case "craft" very seriously. You don't have to be a Dr or lawyer in this world to be successful, having a trade is to be admired. In this case I'm talking about a gentleman named Nampo. He's first chair at V's and deserves it. I can't speak to his skills concerning cutting hair because he only gave me a straight razor shave and a facial massage. He did however, without asking, put his personal touch fine tuning my neck and hairline. Square cut wasn't good enough for him and I happily agreed. I've had a straight razor shave many times but Nampo's attention to detail was terrific. Plenty of hot towels, warm shave cream and a gentle touch made for a relaxing experience. The chair is old school and comfortable. The confidence he had in handling the blade showed many years of experience. When he was done he put some sort of liquid mask on my face that tightened up every last pore. It was an interesting feeling as the mask dried and almost stretched my face tight. That was removed by another hot towel followed by several more lotions and a fall asleep massage. Cost $35 shave + $35 massage. Time 1 hour. Value worth every penny!< /text>< Pictures>

I love this Barbershop! All the barbers are friendly and good cutters. Dan is the man I choose for my cuts. He is not only very friendly but an excellent barber.
I love the look and feel of the shop too! It's just like the shops I used to go to when I was a kid! Great atmosphere and kid friendly!</review>

Got the full service shave and a haircut from a former boxer who had really shaky hands and little confidence when it came to executing a haircut. Screwed up my haircut pretty badly. Cut my face up pretty badly in the shave, and didn't even get a clean shave. Incredibly overpriced for a terribly job. They should screen their barbers more.<//text>

The man who pick up the phones (Bryan) says he is a manager. Gave me the worse experience while just making a appointment. I asked if they could do Africa America hair good and when was the fast I could get my haircut that same day.  Immediately I revived a very angry tone. This man was no happy at all asked him. Honestly as a Africa American man I would never set a foot in V’s barber shop the service they gave me was jaw dropping disrespect. Even started calling me a “kid” but never even see me and I’m 28 so I felt very disrespected and they will never get my service again.< /review>

<text>Stewart is by far the best Barber💈 I have ever worked with on creating and maintaining my ever changing hair styles. He has mad skills and I've never seen his equal. 💇🏻He also cuts my husband's hair and beard.. Frankly my husband hasn't ever looked as sharp as he does when he comes home from V's Barbershop. We are so thankful for Stewart👊We Never leave disappointed or feeling like we didn't get the best value for our money. He is pleasant, professional and a DANG GOOD BARBER🙌  Ask for him specifically and you'll never go anywhere else. 💪<//text><Response>None< /Response>< userid>

Got my haircut with Napo.  Great cut.  Napo took the time to discuss my hair before the cut even started, and then as he went along, took time to show me his work.  Ended up with a great cut.

Shop itself is clean and the rest of the staff are friendly.  Would recommend and will come back.< /text>

I hate to give a good review because then it will be too hard to get an appointment here. This place is awesome though. Straight razor service, TVs, real barbers, I couldn't want anything more (except for maybe the beer I get offered every time).  I have to give this place 5 stars!!!!< /review>

Paid 43 bucks for a averge hair cut? It felt rushed and when i got home there were starnds of single hairs sticking up that barbers usually snip with scissors. My head looked like a fuzz. Barbers are supposes to care about your image. If im pay 43 bucks for a hair cut my hair better be on point, but it wasnt. That was the last straw with Vs and im finding a new Barbershop.</Text>

<text>Look... I went here once and got a decent haircut from a barber named Napo. He did a clean job on a classic combover style haircut the first time. I went in the second time and asked him to define my part a little bit and give me a low fade. He had no idea what he was doing. His idea of a fade was to buzz one side of my head without any blending whatsoever. I literally could of taken a 2 guard and raked it through my hair to do the job he did. It is one of the worst haircuts I've ever had. I didn't  bother even fighting it, I paid and left. He even apologized for not doing what I asked but excused it by saying this is what the young kids like. I'm not a hipster in high school, I like a traditional clean cut look. Now I have to wait a month for my hair to recover. I'm truly embarrassed walking around in public this haircut and will not be going back. I'm sure there are other good barbers but Beware of Napo!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Rude from the very first phone call,  but still decided to take a chance.  I should've listened to the other bad reviews, especially about Stewart.  He was rude and just sat there playing on his phone. If you want unfriendly service and a so-so haircut, this is the place.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Walked in while 2 barbers were working, they look at me and don't say anything. I figured they were waiting for another employee to materialize from the back to help me. I wait 4 minutes and nothing.  They could have at least stopped and walked over or ask me what they could help me with.</Text>

Staff was friendly RN Holly T paid great attention to detail she explained step by step what to expect before surgery. Dr. Greenblatt visited me before surgery to go over details of surgery and to answer all my questions he made me feel at ease. Sharp Coronado also uses bairhugger warming system that kept me warm during my stay thank you Sharp for making it a comfortable experience.</review>

Two stars because the staff was great while I was there. It was filling the prescription that's been an absolute nightmare. Trying to get the pharmacist and doctor on the same page has been agonizing. Going on 5 hours and every time I call one or the other they blame it on the other person. It's maddening. I need medication.<//text>

I called Coronado Sharp Hospital this morning, the the hospital's main line, received a message, put on hold, and no one answered after several minutes. I tried again, twice. I've been on hold now, according to the timer on my phone, for 3 minutes. Someone answered! I asked to be connected to a room. Without an acknowledgement, I was put on hold with the same scratchy music. IS ANYONE THERE??? As I finish this review, on this call, I have been on hold now for more than 7 minutes.< /text>

The doctors and nurses and assistants are fine. Front desk is rude and dismissive and they don't care about patients. I will be changing my primary care physician. A doctor's office should not give patients the run around. Liz in particular was the most rude and even hung up the phone on me. I guess it's my fault for being too broke to afford a real doctor.<//text>

<Review>I would like to share my disappointment regarding the laboratory at Sharp Coronado Hospital. I went in this week to have a series of blood work done which were ordered by my doctor. The following morning, I received a call from my doctor's office informing me that the blood tests are now "invalid" due to negligence of the lab using "expired" tubes. I was shocked to learn that this facility lacked the proper procedures when it came to handling their equipment and inventory. This created stress and was such an inconvenience for me. I was asked to return to the doctor's office to pick up a new lab order. Unfortunately, I now have to wait a few days before I can retest. This turned out to be a major setback. I do not place blame on the phlebotomist. However, there is a serious problem with the way this lab is run. I will not be returning to Sharp Coronado Hospital for any future lab services.</Review>< Response>

WOULD GIVE 6 STARS! Vacationing in Coronado from Arizona.  Took our kids to the beach when it was about 68 degrees outside (which are winter temps to us.)  Wife and I froze but kids had a blast.  Our 5 year old came down with a bad cough.  Drove around for hours the next morning looking for an urgent care that would see him.  NO ONE would.  Our only shot was the ER.  My wife called Sharp and the nurse who answered was extremely helpful, courteous and understanding. Told us to "bring him on in." Landed the suburban out front for the complimentary valet parking and walked into the ER.  Less than an hour later we had chest x-rays to rule our pneumonia,  the doctor (who was a super nice guy) diagnosed mild bronchitis, put prescriptions in our hands and sent us on our way.  I was blown away.  Everyone there was professional and took very good care of our son.  Made him feel comfortable through the whole process. I can't say enough about the staff from the door to the doc.  Thank you for taking care of our little guy.  We'll be hitting the waves again soon.  Only this time we'll wait for some sunshine and temps above 70!<//review>

My mother came to San Diego from NJ for a 10 day vacation to visit with myself and my sister's family. On her 2nd day in Coronado she fell, fractured her hip, and fracture her foot. Was taken taken to Sharp Coronado Hospital via ambulance...paramedics  were awesome.  She was met in the ER by a welcoming team of nurses and docs. Dr. Warm oversees the ER and can be seen throughout the hospital. He even stopped by this morning before her surgery. We  just can't stop  raving about the staff here. Everyone is wonderful. Cater to your every need. You are made to feel special,  like part of their family. It's obvious the  doctors and nurses are so happy with their jobs as it shows in the care they deliver.  Her orthopedic surgeon is Dr. Rynning. What a guy!  The way he talked to mom and made her at ease was heart warming. Direct eye contact the entire time. For family and visitors there is fresh fruit, water urns with lemon/orange water, coffee, tea, and even Ice cream and pudding if you want. They also have a lovely homey cafeteria with a lovely outdoor patio.  Thank you so much!<//Text>

I've had over 15 surgeries and procedures done at several Sharp hospitals and outpatient facilities. 5 of them have been at Sharp Coronado. Sharp Coronado has had the best patient care of all the facilities I've been to. I am grateful for the nurses, staff, and doctors who have made difficult surgical experiences much better experience for me as a patient. I was treated with nothing but kindness and respect.< /text>

Came here on October 29, 2017, after I had sprained my ankle during my morning walk. My right ankle could barely fit into my shoe, and as soon as I came here, the receptionist sent me to the emergency room. From there, three nurses examined my foot, patched it up with an ice pack, and after waiting for thirty minutes, I was relieved once they told me that it was just a bruise. Soon, they removed the pack from my foot and wrapped it in a bandage. Then,  they gave me a special shoe which helped me walk normally.

Thank you, Sharp, for your courteous service.<//Review>

<text>To be honest this place seemed to good to be true and in the end it ended up being so. I arrived with my fiance who had been suffering from a bad stomach bug. I will say all of the staff was wonderful very attentive very kind it made us feel safe and like we were going to get answers and treatment for it. It's been a tough ordeal and my fiance ended up having a fybromialgia flare which causes pain all over her body. When we asked the doctor if there was anything he could do he just told us no because he didnt believe that Fybro was a real condition. This is absurd and a total lack of professionalism. You DO NOT tell someone that the thing that causes them suffering and pain that only they know and feel isnt real you have a responsibility as a doctor to look for answers and explanations as to why something like this might occur and what could cause or flare it. If you do not have enough understanding of something you do not simply disregard it as something imaginary. And to top it off we have been here 3 hours without receiving and more treatment to stop the onslaught of symptoms related to the original complaint. Honestly this place would be amazing if it weren't for this one doctor Diagustino.<//text>< pics>

Took my 12year old for back pain. The doctor ordered an xray. The xray technician did not let me be in the xray room with her even though she is a minor.  Once taken back to the ER the doctor never came back . The nurse came and said ok she is good to go and I said so what does he think she has ? she said oh let me check she looked at the discharge papers and said back pain. I said I know it's back pain that's why we are here . She said call my daughters pediatrician for further testing. I even told her the tramadol I injection that was given to my daughter has not helped her pain at all.</Review>

<Review>I got Dr Cown and she was a great Doctor, nurses were attentive and kept a close eye on me for the almost nine hours I was there.  I think some of these  reviews were talking about somewhere else and not about Coronado Hospital ER.  I have to clarify: If you got Dr Whitney you were out of luck, he is rude, no compassion, no humanity and no care.  But other Doctors other than him, are excellent.  I just wish we had an urgent care in Coronado</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>My husband became seriously ill on a flight to from Fort Lauderdale to San Diego.    Luckily, he checked himself into Sharp Coronado, where he spent a week, and then was transferred to Villa Coronado, Sharp's skilled nursing facility across the street.    I can't describe the level of exceptional care he has received at both locations.   The staff is courteous and knowledgeable.  They are eager to do anything to make him comfortable.

It is a small hospital and usually quiet. The staff are friendly but on the occasions that it is slightly busy, they can get quickly bogged down. Still, I drive here from Allied Gardens when given the option rather than go locally.</Review>

Hospitals render medical care and treatment, but they also have administrative functions.  Thus, although the experience is focused on the the doctor or nurse, administrative staffing is also very important.

I can't say enough good things about my e.r. visit here. I was taken in by the paramedics, was immediately seen & accessed. Everyone from the nurse, Kyle, to Dr. D'agostino gave me the best of care. I have extremely high praise for Breanna, the Respiratory Therapist. She helped me to understand my condition & gave me exercises & tips to use at home. This will always be my first choice for an e.r. visit.<//review>

I went to the ER here because I was nearly blacking out from horrible stomach pains and could hardly move or walk. They proceeded to put me on a bed in one of the rooms and not send a doctor to see me for nearly 2 hours. I was in such agony that I wanted to just go back home and suffer in the comfort of my own bed and bathroom than lay in a cold hospital room without a doctor even coming to see me. I wouldn't have gone to an "EMERGENCY ROOM" if I thought my symptoms were so insignificant that I could just wait hours and hours to be seen. By the end, all they did was take an x-ray and essentially say that there was nothing wrong with my stomach. PS x-rays don't show much besides bones and I'm pretty confident I didn't have a bone upsetting my stomach. The doctor didn't even touch my stomach or anything to feel if something abnormal was going on. Literally she expected the x-ray to be her only evidence. Then I got a $4500 bill in the mail. What a fraud this place is. Overall, this hospital is the worst. I can't imagine worse service if I tried. Extremely slow, rude, uncaring, unprofessional, and basically criminal in the rates that the charge for their complete lack of services actually provided. Next time, I'll  go to the park and find a squirrel to treat me because that would honestly have been more productive. Don't go here. You will be extremely disgusted by the poor service.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1467753254427, 'text': 'Hi Kathleen,\n\nWe are concerned about the experience that you had in the emergency room at Sharp Coronado Hospital and we would like to know more.

Sharp Coronado...awesome hospital!  Very short wait time, you can pre-register online (even for the ER) and the staff was very friendly, caring and understanding.  I pre-registered for a 4pm ER visit yesterday (3/25/16) and within 45 minutes of showing up (and I was 1/2 hour early) I was quickly evaluated, processed and in a room.<//Text>

<Text>NEGATIVE 3 STARS!!!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PLACE FOR MAAAAAANY REASONS! Horrible scheduling (don't even have the dates available when they call to schedule an appointment. Horrible wait times (sometimes over an hour after your appt is scheduled to start). Horrible diagnosing (or lack thereof I should say). Horribly inconsiderate Physician's Assistant (basically just doing what he could to get me out of there as soon as possible). Horrible customer service over the phone (rude, unwilling to help, and BLATANTLY LIED TO MY FACE EVEN WHEN CALLED OUT ON IT...her supervisor later confirmed that she lied to me). Horrible customer service at the desk (again just doing what they can to get you out of there so they don't have to deal with you). Horrible directions provided (give you ridiculous instructions to follow and don't have secondary options when you can't have someone come with you to your appointment). I'm sure the list could go on and on. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!</Text>< pictures>

<review>Worst E.R. experience ever! It was my first time in SD and unfortunately I suffered from food poisoning as soon as I arrived and went straight to the nearest hospital unfortunately this one). The woman in the front desk was awful. She was rude, didn't take my symptoms seriously, and intentionally kept me at the bottom of the queue. Only one nurse on duty even though it was a Saturday afternoon, and he didn't take my symptoms seriously either. I told him that I was cold and ate nothing beyond the 4 crackers that I brought in and he offered nothing. Then as he told me to return to the waiting room, I saw him give blankets to other people. I've never felt like such a 3rd-class citizen in my life. 3 hours of waiting and watching every person be seen by a doctor including people who came in long after me. When I mentioned it to the woman at the front desk, she said that she'll change my pain level on the computer and make sure that I'm next (I can't believe she intentionally put my pain level low in the first place!!!), but after being skipped by another 4 people, I had had enough. When I told her, she didn't care even though I was the only person who was there for 3 hours and still got no treatment. After her sarcastic apology, I told her that I was going to go to another hospital, and she rudely responded "Okay, go to another hospital." On my cab ride out of there, the cab driver even told me that that hospital has a reputation for being prejudiced and showing favoritism towards the wealthy and people from that island. I wish my cab driver that drove me to this hospital told me that because I would have told me to take me elsewhere and avoided this whole mess.<//review>< pics>

After my last visit, I would never recommend anyone to this “Hospital” ever.....I could list my complaints but it’s pointless. Just don’t go there!!! After experiencing what they called “care” “They” do not care. I will never go there again as long as live.</text>

What impressed me the most was how efficient and streamlined the triage process was. I was admitted to the hospital and had surgery scheduled or the next day in less then an hour and half. My Nursing care on the orthopedic floor (2nd floor) was above and beyond and I wanted for nothing. I can not say enough about this hospital. I was totally impressed how efficient and professional it is and I am inspired to educate my hospital in your practices. Thank you.</Text>< pics>

I had been doing a trick on my BMX bike when i fell down and landed on my knee. I knew it was mare than a torn ligament when i was unable  to walk on it and my knee had swelled up to the size of a Honey dew . I kind of have a phobia of hospitals  after a horrible  experience  at my last emergency  room visit at a hospital  in Hillcrest. I have taken a few people  to Sharps in Coronado and felt comfortable  going  to the emergency room  only at Sharps Coronado. Im glad i did. I had shattered  my patella and was in need of surgery. The doctors, nurses, and staff go above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and they have awesome "bedside" manners. Something alot of Hospitals dont have nowadays. I wish there was more people  like that working in that field. If i could give you Ten stars i would. Thank you so much for caring  and taking care of business. I was in surgery by that evening and am now recovering  at home.  I want to thank the staff for a get well card i recived in the mail a few days ago. Thats what i mean by above and beyond. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I wish all emergency  visits were like yours.  Love Carmela Fuentes</Review>

Doctors (with an "s") concur on wrong diagnosis. Don't let them ruin your health and the lives of your love ones by going to this hospital. Doctors who misdiagnose should not be paid but should be sued for malpractice. One particular "doctor" (Roger Oen) behaves like a thug. Any doctor from a third-world country would have more knowledge than this guy. He studied at GWU so that explains it all.<//Text>

<Text>Went to this Emergency department today because I woke up and my wrist was swollen and painful to move 7/10 pain, I cant even clasp my bra. It's a Sunday and tomorrow is a holiday so I decided to go to this ER and have it checked just to make sure it's not broken (I dont take supplements and not into milk). This female caucasian doctor with red hair in her 50s, sees me and tells me I should not have come to the ER for something like "this" (my painful wrist). She asked me why I didnt schedule an appointment with my primary care physician. I told her the pain started today when I woke up, it's a Sunday today and tomorrow is a holiday. If there was an urgent care open today I would have gone there.

As far as I know, being a health personnel, people in healthcare do not talk to their patients that way (and I deal with mental health patients and memory care patients yet we treat them with professionalism). And anyone can go to the ER if they are seeking for medical help and its off hours for walk in clinics. And, mind you, I was the ONLY PATIENT there, not like I'm crowding the ER. And I am a paying customer.

Never coming back to this ER again.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>My daughter goes into the ER to be seen for severe abdominal and back pain along with the inability to urinate for hours. The intake nurse tells her to "try anyway" in tone suggesting that my daughter is lying about her symptoms. These are symptoms she had 2 years ago, went to another hospital, they also say on their asses and did nothing. She ended up having to be intubated and on a ventilator for 2 days. As of this review she has been in a near empty ER for close to 2 hours and is still waiting for a bed. You can screw your feedback email, I know from experience it does nothing anyway.<//Review>< name>

<text>Horribly disappointed in the care my wife received tonight. I took her in to the ED to get checked for a concussion and she wasn't even asked once about the symptoms she's having. I know it was busy tonight, but there is no reason for this lack of care for my wife. She's a nursing student and previously a CNA at a nursing home and hospital back in our home town so you could say she's familiar with the healthcare field. She feels like the doctor talked to her like she was stupid and was rough when examining her. She is cognitive, but is dealing with a great deal of dizziness and pain and all the doctor said after "examining" was you'll live to see another day! There was no scans done to confirm no trauma.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>This is my first time writing a review but I felt it was necessary and felt compelled to tell my experience. I had gone to Sharp Coronado Emergency because I was experiencing severe uterus pains and cramping from a large fibroid ,which also caused other symptoms . I had gone on a Tuesday  evening the doctor was excellent and staff that evening . My labs came back quickly and everything looked good except fibroid which was a size of golf ball in uterus lining , in which , I.had gotten a shot to alleviate pain. The next day my pain was even more intense , light fever , ect, my husband called ER to let them know and he was told to bring me back. When we arrived for second time , a completely different staff , doctor and I was looked at as if why are you here again . The doctor Anvari , acted as if my fibroid pain was insignificant and I explained that I was in serious  pain, I only have one kidney and the swelling from fibroid felt pressure on ureter.She said a remark in which she downplayed the pain I was in as if fibroids aren't life threatening , she was generalizing instead of looking at my situation as a unique , individual. I have had two major surgeries in past and every doctor I had were superb and were very caring plus had excellent communication skills and most of all.empathetic to the patients needs and good listening skills. Dr Anvari lacked all of the necessary qualities that represents a good doctor. My husband even  said to her that yes , fibroids aren't life threatening but my wife's medical history should be considered because I have only one kidney that functions only at 44 percent due to obstruction.of ureter , a previous blockage in which I had surgery for  two years prior. The second day experience left me feeling disappointed in our health system and Dr Anvari deffinately didnt remotely represent Sharp Emergency in a way in which is positive . The experience was absolutely horrible , I have always been treated excellent and felt that my concerns mattered but this doctor acted so unbelievable cold  , im incredibly grateful that I have only experienced a situation like this one time , otherwise I would have no faith in our health system.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80d9534a28c5070d:0x25377cf1827a6a01</gmap_id></record>

<Text>This place is a joke! So I take my sister in law in because she is in terrible pain. They have a receptionist sitting behind 1" thick ballistic glass in an alcove centered in the waiting room, with a nice chair facing the receptionist.  The receptionist can't hear much through the glass and the patients can't hear much from her. This doesn't stop the receptionists from asking a never ending list of highly personal questions. So the volume of discussions that occur at the reception desk carrys all the way out to the parking lot!

So while seated in the waiting area, I am treated one after the next, to the most riveting details of each individuals medical history. At full volume! Often repeated several times sine neither party can really hear through the glass. Some colonoscopy here, some hemorrhoids there. These poor people having to discuss their most intimate moments in life. while onlookers listen in.

Could it get worse? Oh yeah. It did. About the fifth person accompanied by his high school love of his life and wife, figures out in short order that he knows this receptionist from High School. And vice versa, and so does the wife. You ain't heard nothing until you listen in on and hour of medical histories given in cheerleader squeals encompassing every single person these three knew in High School 40 years ago!  I began wondering it I could order up a euthanasia for myself!

Anyway, as it turns out, all the questions asked by the receptionist
of all the parties that sat down, were asked again of those people later on inside the emergency unit. 4 times!!!! It was all a useless exercise in group humiliation in the waiting area.

Also it was interesting to notice that the drug addict got his fix while we were there.....but my sister in law...still crying today in horrible pain....got an ibuprofin! What a joke!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Worst place EVER. I went to this hospital after having pelvic pain for 3.5 weeks, and my doctors advising me to go. Since this one was closest to my husbands work Well, I was the ONLY person in the Emergency room, and after the nurse saying the my husband could be escorted out if he was bothering me (Which I never implied or asked) mainly because she didn't like him talking to me or helping me answer questions. After being in the room and talking to the doctor expressing all of my concerns and family history of Ovarian Cancer, and Hysterectomies all around my age (23-25) by women in my family, the Doctor comes back 20 mins later to tell me: "You came up negative with all the tests we've tested so far, but its looking like its just a UTI" I responded with, "It's not a UTI because I do not have any pain while urinating or any kind of frequency" She then says, "Well that is what I am diagnosing you with, because all I have to do is diagnose you with something that wont kill you in 48 hours so I can get you out of here." I started crying and took my discharge papers, discouraged and still in alot of pain. I highly advise you to NOT go here. There are WAY more hospitals to go to than this one!! Trust me, Avoid this place.< /Text>< pics>

<review>The husband and wife owner have never done us wrong!  We order pizza with them almost every week and they never disappoint.  We even made a large order of pizzas for a kid's birthday party and they really made it easy.  I really appreciate how the owner takes care to  make sure his pizza is just right.  Just recently they threw in a box of their homemade pita chips which are amazing.  I think my wife and I are addicted to them.  Please go pay these guys a visit.</review></record></dataset><record>

The food is amazing and the people are really family. You've got to try the hot dogs when you're here. I don't really have much to add on the grocery, as I don't really do my shopping here, but their Peta chips are amazing!  Truly a little gem!</Text>

In the SGV, Di Pilla's stands out as it's one of the few very good Italian restaurants in an area filled with Asian eateries. A group of us stopped by for a birthday lunch. Their complimentary bread is so good, it's almost addicting. Their pastas are tasty to say the least. I often opt for the half and half which is half spaghetti & half ravioli especially when you can't decide. Today I opted for the beef ravioli with a salad. The pasta is generally al dente which I like.< /text>

When working in El Segundo I will get lunch here. The staff is friendly. Generally get one of their salads or a personal pesto pizza. One time there was an issue with a spinach salad. After letting the manager know, she went above and beyond to remedy the situation.< /Text>

Ordered last night  Wrong order. Wrong prices.
I don’t like calling and was just thinking the call would be unpleasant for some reason. I had way to much to do unpacking. So I called this am. Guy argued, barely spoke English, never will order again from someone who hates speaking with Americans. Don’t care how bad that sounds. If the website is messed up then pay someone to fix it.</text>

I just love this place. The treats are delicious no matter which one you get.  The store is always very clean.  The staff are pretty friendly and helpful, especially when you aren't really too sure just what you want. They are very giving (they serve their treats for $1 on certain days throughout the year). They provide catering services as well! If you haven't tried them yet please do you won't regret it.<//Text>

I was at Subway . The sandwiches are delicious the lady that worked there on father's day on Sunday desirves a raise she worked bye herself and no matter how busy she still manages to out a smile on her face and make polite conversation with you. 5 stars and then some. Ms Donald's need to learn from her very rude co workers need better training

Love one happy costumer< /Review>

< review>
I don't like antiques myself..I like more modern stuff...however I came with my brother who loves antiques.

This place is huge. It is three levels and has thousands of items here.  It is clean for sure.  Outside is lined with train box cars which was cute.  There are working bathrooms as you walk in.

You can find anything from records to jewelry...dolls...lamps...kitchen items...baseball cards...crib...tabe...chairs...paint...a whole buffet of items....you name it...and it seems like they carry it.

I don't know antique pricing...so I can't really determine if the pricing is good or not.

I did take many photos of what they have in the store just in case you see something you like.

We did not buy anything...but it was super fun looking at all the different items in the store</review>

people will complain about anything and everything, I say heck to the negative comments because this place is nothing short of awesome. They have a solid collection of antique items. I could truly look around for hours and see something new & cool every time. thank you for it all♥️ my favorite antique shop!</text>

<text>Interesting place.
But:
A lot of items vintage style instead of classic and a lot of kitsch / partially just used standard household items.
And no eye catchers.
Prices way too high.
And do not enter the rest rooms if not really necessary. They were as old as the items which got sold.</text>< user>

I felt there was a lot of dust in the air which made me feel like I needed to use my inhaler. But it is an interesting place to browse lots of different types of collections. Everything from comic books Barbie dolls old clothing old kitchenware teacups albums odds and ends and a variety of older toys. Lots of costume jewelry and other items if you're a collector or just looking for that treasure this is the place to go.< /text>< Pictures>

Best place ever! You can always find a great deal and so much variety.  Karen who is an employee there is such a gem and knows exactly where to find whatever you're looking for. My children also love the various toys and trinkets and there is always new merchandise coming in. Can't get enough of Cordelia Junction!<//review>

<review>Greatest antique collection in the area. An antique mall with vendors different styles and tastes that collide in a great place to shop.

<Time>1526249411540<//Time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>The overall concept of the train depot with actual train cars is unique and charming. However, the store smells of dirty bathrooms as you walk in. Immediately to the right of the entrance is a large dedicated space to “scumbags” and “wanted” people. It sets the vibe! The store is full of random antiques. We shop for vintage glassware and some booths had a good selection. However, as a dealer myself I think the condition of the building actual hurts the sales and decreases traffic into the store. The men’s bathroom had only one working toilet and the urinal was covered with a black trash bag. The owners should spend some money and fix the store up.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I love this place if nothing just to walk through and browse! They have most of their antiques set up in "booths"; a person rents a space and decorates and displays their antiques to sale. There is really cool stuff from all eras, and for all different things. Clothing, dishes, artwork, knickknacks.. You name it. Everytime you think you're done, there still more around the corner. Im not sure if their prices are fair or not because I don't buy antiques. But like i said, it's cool enough just to stop by when you have some time to kill or just want to get out of the house.< /text>

<Text>I went on an adventure one day to check out a supposed record shop that was located there. We brought some friends from Washington who collect records. Was super disappointed about the supposed record store ...BUT....WAIT.. OMG...that brought us to this amazing place!!!! I literally shed a tear of excitement when I first walked in and feasted my eyes on the treasures ahead! I didn't know where to start and I felt like I wanted to BURST with excitement! This place is AMAZING! Well layed out, the vendors have everything so neat and almost displayed by themes or color coded it was visually appealing! I felt for the things I was looking to buy the prices were fair for both the buyer and the seller to come away happy. But...WAIT! The staff there were SO DAGUM nice and knowledgeable I enjoyed talking with them all and I walked away wanting to give them more money!lol I am in LOVE with this place! Can't you tell??? I don't live close if I did I'd be there AT least once a week..lol, definitley a fun place to treasure hunt!

There were lots and lots of different areas filled to the brim with many vintage and some antique items. Plenty to browse through for hours. However, in our experience here, there were no friendly or helpful staff members available. We weren't even greeted by the people behind the front desk. 😕< /text>

<review>I LOVE THIS PLACE, I've been coming here on and off for 10yrs was there yesterday with my daughter Tina and bought some goodies for my son Hunter who's 3 picked up some hotwheels cars for a $1 and a mickey mouse for my grandson RJ  he picked it and loved it.. The staff is helpful kind and knowledgeable... Only wish one could barter bc thats the FUN of shopping in thrift stores and antique malls but there is a sign that says NO BARTERING
But still 5stars please reconsider this policy bc I have walked away over the years on things that I really would have LOVED to take home but had to pass bc I just thought it was a bit more than I was willing to pay.. Only to return months later and find same Item on sale and purchased it however it could have been in my home months prior for me to enjoy.. GOING back today w my granddaughter Bella to look again!!!
Thanks for being a fun place with awesome stuff..<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I like the space and the theme, but the selection from the dealers leaves a lot to be desired. There is very little here in the way of antiques. It's mostly junk, collectibles, and wall hangers.</Text>

Then we got the homemade spaghetti, the topping we're pretty good but it was super oily and not enough sauce. The only thing that was good was the pizza cause it did have the New York Style to it. Definitely can think of A LOT of other places to try then this one for pizza!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Absolutely the worst pizza place I've ever ordered from in my life. Not only did they get my order wrong and put onions and mushrooms on the pizza which might I say I am allergic to. They also refused to make the order right. I was so hungry from working all day and not being able to get anything to eat, so I took off the toppings and ate the crust. This place is ridiculous, by far my worst experience with a pizza place< /review>

I ordered a thick crust pizza and received a thin crust pizza. The crust was paper thin, any thinner and there wouldn’t have been a crust. There was barely any sauce but it did have plenty of cheese. I will never buy their pizza again.</text>

I literally just threw it away. Soggy uncooked mess. If I was the biz owner I'd step up my game.. you're right across the street from a pizzahut.. I paid you $30 but the same pizza across the street would've been half that.. and it would have been cooked..< /text>

I adore this restaurant! They serve sensational food, their menu is varied, The chef in that restaurant is very experienced, I love very much trying all their dishes. The dishes are always fresh and tasty, the service towards the guests  is good. I often eat in this restaurant and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it to all my friends.<//review>

<Review>Prompt delivery, but with a $25 minimum purchase.  Decent pizza, but NY style it is not, crust is too fluffy.  The stuffed mushrooms are pretty shameful, as they were undercooked.  Wings were alright, decent char and flavor but I was expecting sauced.

I will say, compulsory ranch and marinara is a plus.</Review>< rate>

Ok let me say my family is not a fan of new york style pizza in past but this one was on point. Quick pick up, non greasy, soft crust edged pizza how we like it. The carry out deal works great for my large family. My first time here well be regulars. Excited to try out the rest of the menu.<//Review>

<Text>The pizza tasted good but the crust was very floppy.  I give the pizza a 7 out of 10. If I go back, I'll ask them to add more cook time. The potato wedges tasted good with a light seasoning coating.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Really great place, the portion size is huge for a slice of pizza, so you know you're getting your moneys worth! Also one pizza slice is big enough to fill up an average person for nearly the whole day. Will admit, the inside dining isn't really too great; however, if you're taking a slice home or just looking for a quick bite, its definitely the place to order from. Good quality ingredients, short wait times on a quick meal, and most important the price is really good for what you get. 5/5.</Review>< pics>

Don't even bother, Waste of time. Read all other bad reviews, not worth it. Received a flyer and decided to order, first delivery charge.... ok.  then proceeded to order the family deal #2 which is  2 topping pizza. Well the person taking the order said that'd be a extra topping charge. Why? All pizzas already come with cheese. Fine, then got a pepperoni with cheese. Again the guy said double extra charge. Don't even bother with these clowns. Its places like these that need to go out of business.<//text>

<Review>Born and raised in California, original 909er and I've never had a bad pizza from Dave's. Everytime we go or have it delivered it's amazing tasting and doesn't hurt us like chain pizza places do. The price is amazing and we have never been disappointed. Recommend this pizza place a million times<//Review>< pictures>

From the looks of it, I was nervous about the food ( got a to go order). Especially since I was the only customer in there. But when it was time to Chow down, we were all impressed with the pizza and subs! Very friendly service as well.< /Text>

Ordered off the website at 9:00pm. Received a e-mail confirmation and was charged.

No pizza by 10:30, so I call. David, the owner, tells me he never received the order and blamed me or the 3rd party service he uses to take online orders. I call the 3rd party service, and they say Dave's confirmed the order, but they apologized anyway and gave us a full refund + a 3$ coupon.

As a customer I want to pay money and receive a pizza. I don't really care how this is accomplished, but I felt like David had excuses when he should have just apologized for the inconvenience. This was the first time I ordered from here and I will probably not be trying again.

I ended up eating a banana for dinner. For that reason I give this place 1 star.<//Review>

Spend $35. The pizza was good however despite warning from grub hub I ordered mozzarella sticks and wings. Wings here slimy although I asked extra crispy and the mozzarella sticks you can tell they are reheated from a bag< /Text>

An older guy was rude as soon as I walked through the door. I knew what I wanted already and I was asking for clarification to make sure I was getting the right thing and he responded to each of my small questions very rudly. I ignored his rudeness because I really wanted pizza and I thought maybe he was having a bad day. But then as I was paying with my debit card, with an attitude he told me to sign on the computer and he walked off to the back and started gathering supplies in a way as if I was bothering him. I asked him where do I sign because the signiture line didn't show up some other stuff did and Without looking he said "it says sign right there." I asked where, then he finally came to the computer and he saw that he was wrong and clearly wasn't finished doing what he was suppose to do, but he wanted to save face and he said "you see the options right?" In a rude way while pressing something to make the signature line to pop up. I then asked can I get a refund and if my transaction didn't go through yet. He wasn't expecting that, but again, he tried to save face and was still being a butt head. I went to the Chinese spot next door. It wasn't worth being disrespected for no reason. I don't want to throw the race card, but his attitude came out of left field.</Review>

I ordered an Italian sub but when I got home I found out the order was wrong. They gave me some type of marinara and sausage sandwich, I thought no big deal then took a bite..... I had a mouth full of marinara sauce and bread I took another bite hoping to get some meat but got more marinara then the first bite, so then I take a drink of my ice tea and it had this strange hard water taste to it. A couple hours later I felt sick. I will never eat at this place again! Eww!< /text>

Went for a gift. They have a lot of basic everyday clothing for men and keep up with styles on the woman side. Good clearance racks and reasonable makeup and accessories.<//review>

<Review>Everything was pretty expensive, but they have a fairly decent sized selection. I bought a watch, and it worked for about 2 hours, then the bands ripped and now it won't even tick, but the watches are a final sale, couldn't get my money back.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

The store actually closes at 15 minutes before the posted time online. According to the employees they have been unsuccessful in getting the hours changed online. So they actually close at 8:15pm Monday through Saturday and 6:45pm on Sunday.</Review>

<text>Had a great experience with this company.  The office staff was great and provided prompt and detailed information.  Sean came to measure and just a few weeks later took no time at all to install a beautiful front screen.  The price was also very reasonable.

Highly recommended< /text>< pics>

<userid>103042924538678656074</userid><rating>5< /rating><name>Da Honu</name><text>When I first started looking for screens for my French Patio doors. I looked at several different brands. However I kept coming back to Clearview.  Main reason was for the speed reduced. With you grandkids, I wanted something safe.

Sarah at the office was very nice and understood what I wanted. I was out of their area and referred me to a local guy, but he wasn’t installing anymore. No problem Sarah to the rescue talked to her boss and he agreed to come out.

Today (4/28/2020) Shawn showed up, introduced himself and started working. He was very efficient and fast. He cleaned up after the install and even vacuumed any small fragments from the install. Once he was done he showed me how the door functions, how the one side (left) can stay shut and locked into place. I opted for the internal magnets and the standard nylon door handle.

Shawn left me with stickers to prevent people from walking through it and left me with a bottle of track silicone lube to make sure the screens keep moving smooth.

I am so happy I chose ClearView.

I will update this next year.<//text><response>None< /response><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

I recently replaced an inexpensive retractable screen door with a Clear View Retractable Screen.  The difference is like night and day.  The Clear View product operates as smooth as silk!  I wish I would have made the change to Clear View a long time ago.  The installation was flawless and the Customer Service was over the top.  Thank you Clear View!< /Review>

I am writing this review before the product is installed and the rating reflects the way the whole process has been managed to date.

I called to get an appointment set up for someone to come out and see what options were available to me and discuss pricing. I was given a time 2 weeks out on a Saturday with a specific time of 12:00 PM; not a window of time but a specific time. On the day of the appointment at 12:58 PM, I called ClearView office and I asked if someone was still coming out and at 1:20 PM I received a call from the tech saying he is running late and will be there in 20 minutes. He showed up just before 2 PM and spent about 15 minutes there discussing the options and collecting the 50% down payment on 2 doors.

On the following Monday, I received a call scheduling the install for a Saturday, 3 weeks out, which is in about 3 days from when I am writing this review for 1:30 PM; again, not a window of time but a specific time. Today, I get a call saying that they need to "pull back" the appointment by a little bit to 3 PM! I think they meant push out to 3 PM, so I called to see what happened and after going through the Abbott & Costello routine with the first person who answered the call getting no logical response for the push out, she had me speak with another person who told me they are very busy this summer and that the same guy that was late the last time will be out between 3 & 5 PM on Saturday! Wait, until now everything has been a specific time, now it is a window of time 3 days before the appointment and I have to change my plans for Saturday to accommodate their poor or inept scheduling management. She said we have too many appointments scheduled for Saturday morning and didn't want to be late so they pushed my appointment out. In other words, they squeezed another 1 or 2 appointments in pushing me out because "we are very busy this summer"!

The experience to date has not been very good and I am hoping the quality of product and installation is not horrible because "it has been a very busy summer" for ClearView. Clearly, customer service is not their concern!<//Text>

We are a 25 year old company specializing in all things screens. This product, the ClearView Retractable Screen is hands down, by far ,the best retractable screen door on the market today. We have seen them all.</text>

We've had our retractable screens for several years now and they've been terrific. They're low-profile and look great and are very effective. They've even survived children walking through them more than a few times with no problems. We've used the provided lubricant spray about once a year to keep the mechanism running smoothly and have had no problems. Installation was quick, friendly and efficient.</review>

I love this screen door! I had it installed pn my front door at least 18 months ago and it is working perfectly. The mechanism is smooth and being rolled up most of the time, the screen stays clean, and the track is easy to keep clear of debris. The installer was very nice and efficient. I would recommend ClearView to anyone. Thanks guys!< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>From the first phone contact to the final testing of the 2 installed screen doors, the attention to detail and this company's professionalism in communicating and service, were far above any company Ive ever had perform home repairs or improvements to our home. The retractable screen doors are easily worth the additional price, and you'll be convinced far prior to the installation, due to the representative (in our case the owner and founder of the company) coming out to measure your specific project, a very detailed explanation of what sets their product and installation apart from their competition will be given. We loved what we heard so much, we purchased an additional door for the garage to house entryway the day we had our consultation/measure. couldn't be happier with the entire process from beginning to end!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Love, love, love my screens and the ClearView Retractable Bay Area folks!  I have had my three screens (two  to back yard and one to the garage/kitchen) for ten years and i absolutely love them!  They have gotten a LOT of use and abuse (family dogs and cats) and they still work - i recently had one of them re-screened as my granddaughters full size German Shepard destroyed it - i was heartbroken but the fold at ClearView came out - prescreened it and we are back in business again!  These folks walk the walk on customer service!  I highly recommend them and the screens!  Thanks ClearView - you ROCK!  and I can once again enjoy my home and the outdoors!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808e333e33fb7783:0xb9734898febe6830<//gmap_id></record>

<text>I bought 2 screen doors in 2009 (10 years ago) and they are still holding up well...and I'm so glad I bought them.  They are simple and convenient to use...and I often get compliments on them.  They were a bit more expensive than what you can find at Home Depot or Lowes...but the quality is much greater with Clearview screens.  Worth every penny.< /text>< Pictures>

ClearView Retractable Screens is a great company with an excellent product line for anyone looking to install screen doors at the front door or at the patio where you have sliding glass doors.  The screens disappear when not in use and use magnets when you are using them.  It's great to use in the summer when there is a nice breeze but where you don't like to have bugs / debris blowing into your home.  Installation is easy and the crew is great if you have any issues / problems.  We had a magnet replaced and it was a "no brainer".  Check them out!< /text>

Best screen door out there!
The owner came out and measured our door to make sure the new retractable screen would fit perfectly. Most door frames are not square which can compromise the fit. We are constantly asked by our guests where we got the "cool" front screen door and with the lock latch we feel safe and secure when the front door is left open.</review>

<Name>Amy Sapp< /Name><Review>I purchased motorized roller screens to screen in a patio. All components are well made, and after three years, still look and work like new. We leave the sceens down most of the time because they make my patio into an additional room, where we can have dinner without worrying about insects. They also let my cats experience the outdoors without actually going out.  I was very pleased with ClearView’s service, from consultation to installation.

<rating>5< /rating><text>I bought two retractable screens from ClearView for the two patio doors opening to my balcony in my condo.  One of the owners came out to my apartment to measure and a 2nd young man installed them.  Both were very professional.  I love the retractable screens completely.  They blend into the door jamb when not open and are very stylish in appearance.  They glide open and closed and I don't know how I survived the flying insects in my apartment before.  They give you little sticky decals to put on the screen so you don't inadvertently walk into the closed screen since they are really "see thru".  When I needed more they willingly sent me more for no charge.  I highly recommend this company that manufactures their top quality product in the Bay Area.</text>< pictures>

Called up San Jose store to get a quote on two does. This company does not do " Free" estimates. Based on minimal info. The salesperson stated they would need 50% down to do the job.
I like the looks of the screens, but, terrible way of doing business. Flat out told me they do not do free estimates. If I needed something, take pictures and send them in.
That is terrible service.  I will post again with a name of a company that will stop by, look at what needs to be installed and is more business friendly!</Text>

3 stars-good product. Recommended!!
Im happy not to deal with bent frames any longer.
Rescreening only costs $150 apiece.
The product is simple and clean.  Its a little pricy, but service is obtainable. The installer leaves a can of spray silicone(Make sure it is used frequently). After 3 Summer months, The screen material is starting to separate at the top edge where it slides in the track.< /text>

Rude customer service. Bad attitudes and they try to rip you off. Beatrice the lady that helped me gave me a quote for insurance through the phone I agreed to that quote which was $65 a month. (Not bad) but she ended up charging my card $189 I hadn't signed any documents or even got a policy number from her. Then I got a call for a better quote with more coverage (full coverage) with uninsured motorists and roadside assistance. Then I was told that if I was charged more than just $65 that I was being charged fees for their services and that I can be refunded in full since I hadn't signed anything or even received any type of confirmation or policy number. Anyway I call this lady back and she has a whole attitude and says I most likely ain't going to receive any of my money back. So I had to contact my attorney and he told me what to say to this lady and with what I was advised I said and I was refunded in full within 5 mins. These people are cons. Unless you have a bad driving record there should be no reason to use adriana's insurance.<//Text>

I was insured with Adrianas & I feel like they just played me , the lady kept saying that no other insurance was going to take me because of my record & since my contract finished with them & I had to renew it . I started looking some place else & I got a way way cheaper price , everything the same how I had it with Adrianas & it’s way cheaper . I also went in with my boyfriend because we were trying to process a payment on the app & the lady said she couldn’t help us with that . So we decided to process the payment there . Then I asked her if she can remove the credit card that was associated with the policy & she said she couldn’t because she needed the owner of the card & policy to be there . EVEN THOUGH THE CARD WAS ALREADY EXPIRED . I wasn’t asking her to take out a payment . I was only asking her to remove the card FOR GODS SAKE< /review>

It’s been five days. I called to get a phone quote to add more cars and vehicles to my policy and I still haven’t heard back. I was supposed to get an email containing the policy so I can go through it and still no email. I called and talked to a “manager” and still no email. Now I can’t get a hold of him. You get for what you pay for, I guess. Not happy with Arleta office!!< /text>

Place offers horrible policies. They tie you down with monthly payments and slowly charge fees for any changes. Avoid this place. Give an online carrier a shot... Progressive, Geico...< /Text>

<review>They have low prices but good luck if you're in an accident. They would not help you through claim process even when it's not your fault. In my case, my aunt was rear ended, and they told her that they DIDN'T help with claim process unless she pays her deductible. Shocked I called their office and this was confirmed! Couldn't believe they wouldn't help with process as all other insurance providers help to work with you to resolve accident claims. We had to go through the other parties insurance to resolve our claim. Terrible service and do yourself a service avoid at all cost.
Muy mal servicio y no te ayudan cuando tengas un acidente aunque no sea tu culpa. Ellos solo te dicen que tu lo resuelvas o que pages tu deductible. Increible que mal servicio, hagan se un favor y eviten esta aseguransa</review><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_name>Henry Espinoza</user_name><gmapID>0x80c290d8097e8a39:0xb73687229e6341b5</gmapID>< user>

(Translated by Google) They gave me the prisoners of my polisa every 6 months 3 times first one too high to see if I later accepted a little less and another prisoner later in the end I had to change my insurance that gave me a more acceptable prisoner that is my opinion

< review>
(Translated by Google) From my point of view, the attention is a shame, I have spoken by phone with the employees of the Rancho Cucamonga offices and their attention is excellent, I went to the office 5 times and 4 of them I had to return without being able to solve a single one of my problems and that they were not accident claims, only modify policies or change payment method

Para mi punto de vista es una verguensa la atencion, yo he ablado por telefono con los empleados de las oficinas de Rancho Cucamonga y su atencion es excelente, fui 5 veces a la oficina y 4 de ellas me tube que regresar sin poder solucionar ni uno de mis problemas y eso que no eran reclamos de accidentes solo modificar polizas o cambiar forma de pago< /review>

I have visited this location several times and have had ok experience, but the last time was only two days ago and I have to say that the customer service I received was great. Priscilla Hernandez, which is the person that assisted me, provides me with amazing service. She took the time to actually go over every detail with me, as I had many questions and concerns. She went above and beyond. She is great at what she does. Keep up the good work.<//review>

<Review>Their services are ok if your in a situation. BUT If you don't want to deal with lowlife staff and upper management. If you don't like drama then I suggest you AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. I reported fraudulent activity by one of the staff members and I never heard back from management. When the completion of all this went down the regional manager was right there and did nothing about it. I soon began to realize that she was probably in support of it. What a mess.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I used to love this place, but they are not that restaurant anymore. Poor standards and even worse management. I was told that my bisque was supposed to have large shell pieces. My Oysters shell were partially broken, and shell was  mixed with the meat. The manager did give me that one. Terrible experience.  I wonder if I should have brought a group. I was treated much better when I brought my family.< /Text>< username>

Been coming to Scoma's for 20 plus years! Our favorite hideaway when we visit the city, so glad to see you were able to survive during this mess!! Your crab cakes set the bar for all others, and your double cheeseburger hit the spot. Thank you!< /Text>

I ordered food to-go through their website & had a fantastic experience. The order was ready early. I had the crab cakes & clam chowder. I was a little skeptical about ordering seafood to-go but both were really tasty - some of the best I've had! The staff I interacted with were very friendly. Would definitely go back. The patio looked super cute with nice views, so I'd like to eat there next time.<//review>

We came for a weekend trip and decided to have Sunday brunch on the warf. Best decision ever. The food presentation was artistic and Beautiful! The aroma was incredible. The smoked trout was to die for. It was smoothe and buttery in texture and the smoke on it was perfect. The crab bisque was creamy and had a smokey flavor to it which I loved.  The clams in the chowder were very tender and fresh which we enjoyed with the deliciousand fresh sourdough. My favorite dish however was the Salmon and crab cake Benedict. My eggs were cooked to perfection and the cake was the best I have ever had. There is definitely something to be said about eating fresh seafood right on the warf. The only thing that could have made my experience better would have been to watch the fishing boats unloading at the docks but it was Sunday. We did however get a lovely visit from a few Sea Lions. Couldn't have asked for a better experience on our trip.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiVorGCJmQbfOBTOBiUILI5cmAwKY6pZqnizD8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn-G2RDmx0pFV790NsnemY-_Y6ymr--assxeJh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCFTN7fMGNU0eSWYSUYMXgsO3pZjGDMGLVZGjt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiZr0gc2lQjmKndtz7kWZWUVmG--JvWcPakm_y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI5NwvOVAMSDt12qJvB81qOEs0C1_DRsttJWLG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy4Sjcj3lQPjthbS-6E5G-HNaBJFmCUOqDAWn2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</gmap_id></record>

Excellent quick service, I had a reservation but was able to be seated sooner than our appointed time. The food was fresh,not surprised since we are right by the water. Fried calamari had a perfect consistency of batter, texture and flavor. I had to try the crab cake sandwich, I was not disappointed in the moist and crispy cake on a beautiful brioche bun they served me. I had a crack in my glass, I alerted the waiter to prevent any accidents/messes, he replaced the glass and beverage right away. I had to pass on the dessert, I was much too full to proceed. I recommend this place to anyone trying to have a peaceful dinner with terrific service. The price is also great for the quality of food.< /text>

<text>Amazing food. Friendly service.

My friend and I sat at the bar and had a marvelous experience. The bartender Kyler couldn't be friendlier. He recommended the right tequilas and meal.

The crab cakes were perfect. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp) was divine. The hanger steak with chimichurri sauce was grilled to perfection.

I've brought many friends here over the years and look forward to next time!< /text>< rating>

A San Francisco institution that has adapted with the times. Kudos to Scoma’s for keeping the show going with great to go food and beverage. The out door dining options are really great now, especially if the weather is nice. The hosts, bartenders, wait staff and kitchen are all very kind and smiling. The food quality is really great and the prices are reasonable. Always fresh amazing g quality fish and seafood. The chowder and crab bisque are amazing. The calamari is a favorite. The sourdough is on point. Make sure to stop by especially if the weather is nice. Make a rez if you don’t want to wait but waiting around with a drink soaking in the scene ain’t so bad. Spicy margarita is excellent. Thanks!</Text>

Food favorites - definitely recommend the crab cakes and clam chowder! Both were amazing.

Experience - staff was really friendly and it was so nice to sit outside and enjoy the views. The patio is dog friendly which was perfect for our pup! Service was a little slow at times but we were busy most of the time in good company.

Price - coming from Chicago I thought things were slightly overpriced here, even for seafood but maybe that’s normal to the area.

Overall would recommend!<//Text>

Delicious food and efficient, friendly service. The hostess informed us the bayside view was a bit windy so we sat on the other side which was quiet, pleasant and felt more private. Our waiter was so friendly and checked on us often. We also ordered starters; calamari fritters and a cup of clam chowder. Couldn’t take a picture fast enough before we dug in but it was so good. We will absolutely come back to try more options.< /Text>

Excellent quick service, I had a reservation but was able to be seated sooner than our appointed time. The food was fresh,not surprised since we are right by the water. Fried calamari had a perfect consistency of batter, texture and flavor. I had to try the crab cake sandwich, I was not disappointed in the moist and crispy cake on a beautiful brioche bun they served me. I had a crack in my glass, I alerted the waiter to prevent any accidents/messes, he replaced the glass and beverage right away. I had to pass on the dessert, I was much too full to proceed. I recommend this place to anyone trying to have a peaceful dinner with terrific service. The price is also great for the quality of food.</Text>

Upon arrival, we were snottily informed that they don't do reservations for drinks. We were sat in a disused section, apparently the "seats of shame".

As we sat and sipped our drinks (15 minutes of a wait for those), we watched the main outdoor dining section. Not only was it not full, but it continued to empty as we sat.

Had the front desk jockey been kinder, we would have had more to drink and even snacks. Who knew that restaurants would be in a hurry to mistreat customers after being closed for so long?< /review>< time>

Make a reservation for this place, to sit indoors. The food is outstanding. Even sitting outside in the cold, the food was good but the cold temperatures of springtime makes you think twice about staying outdoors to eat.< /text>

We came for a weekend trip and decided to have Sunday brunch on the warf. Best decision ever. The food presentation was artistic and Beautiful! The aroma was incredible. The smoked trout was to die for. It was smoothe and buttery in texture and the smoke on it was perfect. The crab bisque was creamy and had a smokey flavor to it which I loved.  The clams in the chowder were very tender and fresh which we enjoyed with the deliciousand fresh sourdough. My favorite dish however was the Salmon and crab cake Benedict. My eggs were cooked to perfection and the cake was the best I have ever had. There is definitely something to be said about eating fresh seafood right on the warf. The only thing that could have made my experience better would have been to watch the fishing boats unloading at the docks but it was Sunday. We did however get a lovely visit from a few Sea Lions. Couldn't have asked for a better experience on our trip.< /text></record>

Amazing food. Friendly service.

My friend and I sat at the bar and had a marvelous experience. The bartender Kyler couldn't be friendlier. He recommended the right tequilas and meal.

The crab cakes were perfect. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp) was divine. The hanger steak with chimichurri sauce was grilled to perfection.

I've brought many friends here over the years and look forward to next time!<//review>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>Food favorites - definitely recommend the crab cakes and clam chowder! Both were amazing.

Experience - staff was really friendly and it was so nice to sit outside and enjoy the views. The patio is dog friendly which was perfect for our pup! Service was a little slow at times but we were busy most of the time in good company.

Price - coming from Chicago I thought things were slightly overpriced here, even for seafood but maybe that’s normal to the area.

Overall would recommend!< /Text><name>Carole Sorensen<//name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8SHpmRsu8tUYYpmYXJanO8wH5606x91cksbGG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_EBQuNejIKYA9brJ6xytDuLM1aqymBzCCALzh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9GOnED9-H9nvv3M0n5n1y-MEOkzYLId6YX4Gn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPknBT9NXjvbbbZDtVS-37H-ybO8wb42QJ9jvnT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><user>109273567763408553438</user>< date>

<text>A San Francisco institution that has adapted with the times. Kudos to Scoma’s for keeping the show going with great to go food and beverage. The out door dining options are really great now, especially if the weather is nice. The hosts, bartenders, wait staff and kitchen are all very kind and smiling. The food quality is really great and the prices are reasonable. Always fresh amazing g quality fish and seafood. The chowder and crab bisque are amazing. The calamari is a favorite. The sourdough is on point. Make sure to stop by especially if the weather is nice. Make a rez if you don’t want to wait but waiting around with a drink soaking in the scene ain’t so bad. Spicy margarita is excellent.

<Text>If you are looking for fresh and great tasting fish and seafood, look no further. This restaurant has earned its reputation.

The service is very good and traditional. The waiting staff are very informative and explain the menu, especially making sure you are aware of what has been caught that day.

The cocktails are also amazing.< /Text>< Date>

<Review>Delicious food and efficient, friendly service. The hostess informed us the bayside view was a bit windy so we sat on the other side which was quiet, pleasant and felt more private. Our waiter was so friendly and checked on us often. We also ordered starters; calamari fritters and a cup of clam chowder. Couldn’t take a picture fast enough before we dug in but it was so good. We will absolutely come back to try more options.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLNBvnJMj9IVWiQPT_3emcg6xdR39XMmpG-Bll=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlcI2hjQtId9YSvU7_S-Pfv3yGaiLD3Egj6Wn_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMec-Csn2IEjGs7qZujWBg0vubnorcYhYjXOait=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Wonderful date place! Weird ally location with a gorgeous marina, overpriced weak ,measured cocktails...only the Manhattan and Martini have ,what I would call, a booze forward sotuation.The menu is ALL seafood. Except for truffle parmesan fries. Very old and famous. And, wow..what a view! If you want a 200 dinner, this is your spot! Dont ask to plug in your cell phone..there is a rule that says No! Hilarious bonus, you can usually park there.....down the Ally, pass the marina..bang a left..and BAM....you get to park. Ay su set there is a fabulous seagull show on the roof as above the trash cans.</Review>

Good choice for seafood along the wharf. The classic design and more mature staff lend an air of authenticity beyond some of the other restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the clam chowder, which was rich and full of little morsels of clam. Similarly, the crab thermidor was packed with chunks of crab. It was served with a rich, creamy sauce and served on a bed of orzo. However, the citrus flavor was a little bit strong for my palette.</Text>

Some beautiful outside seating here. What a view! Enjoyed a bottle of Albirino from Spain. Crisp white light wine. Perfect for a warm day. We shared calamari, crab cakes, beet salad and clams on garlic toast    Every item was delicious. And our server this sweet native of France was so delightful.</Text>

<text>I tried the mixed seafood grill. Very good fish, especially the shrimps, among the best I ever had. Service was very good and I didn’t have to wait for a table since I chose the cocktail lounge. 4 stars because is a bit overpriced for the amount (39$). Plus there is a 4% gratuity on top of normal tipping.< /text>< Time>

It was intimate and well appointed. Service!  This was old world service. I can't remember the last time I had service this attentive to detail and my dining experience. The food was excellent. The dining selection is broad and the Chardonnay I selected was perfect. The food was excellent. Scallops were expertly seared, shrimp cocktail was delicious, risotto was just right, dessert snd coffee were an indulgent experience. I loved the entire experience and highly recommend this treasure just steps away from the commercial clatter of the high traffic tourist spots.< /text>< pictures>

Like most places in Fisherman's Wharf, well overpriced. However, the food is good and the atmosphere is great. Slightly upmarket, but if you want a nice Italian seafood restaurant in the local area, this place fits the bill.< /text>

This is one of the top restaurants I’ve ever been to and definitely our favorite from our San Francisco trip.  Absolutely everything our party of 11 ordered we loved. You can’t go wrong with any of their dishes.

The service was also impeccable.  If you’re a dessert person try the seven layer cake.

Their seafood is top notch but if you’re a red meat fan their steak was also extremely good.<//Text>

<Review>It had been over six months since I had had a meal at a restaurant or made a reservation. With the sun shining, the idea of enjoying a cold crab salad overlooking the water appealed to me. Plus it's a nice image thinking of Al Scoma creating a family business 50+ years ago and having a pier named after him. Could such a story unfold for a scrappy go-getter these days?

We were a few minutes early for our lunch reservation, so we took the time to enjoy the view of the water and the mosaic ode to the city outside. Definitely easy to appreciate on a warm day. A few minutes later, we were seated at a picnic style table and received sourdough bread and whipped butter, and glasses of ice water.

Unfortunately, one of the glasses had remnants of red lipstick on it. We brought it to our server's attention, and later on, he replaced our water. Without a word, he took the glass and walked away. I couldn't help thinking it would have been nice if he had shown some sign of remorse. I understand that dishwashers can leave behind residue, but given these especially germaphobic times, a little sign of concern for the patrons from the staff goes a long way.

$13 Crab Bisque Bowl:
This orange bowl had a creamy tomato flavor with chunks of crab meat, topped with chives and cracked pepper.

$21 Scoma's Dungeness Crab Cake:
A pair of lightly battered and fried crab medallions were served with a small portion of arugula salad on the side and some creamy dipping salad. The crab was still chunky, which was definitely a plus, because that definitely beats crab cakes with pulverized crab mush.

$47 Scoma's Crab Louis Salad "Classic" 1/2 lb:
I knew the Crab Louis was going to be a large portion, even with the smaller "Classic" sized portion, but when I saw the plate set down in front of me, I knew we would have leftovers. The pile of crab meat sat on top of shredded lettuce, decked out with juicy heirloom tomatoes, cucumber slices, a boiled egg, bell peppers, carrots, olives, lemon wedges, and a ramekin overflowing with Louis dressing. It was cool and refreshing, not to mention the crab and the accoutrements were sweet and satisfying. My only complaint was I would have preferred if the carrot were peeled, because the outer layers looked a touch hairy.
I happily packed up the leftovers and looked forward to digging into it for my next meal. Our server joked that we did a good effort, but ate too much of the salad, haha.

I thoroughly enjoyed the food, and I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I had the opportunity to witness seeing the 'Pier to Plate' process unfold. I would rate my experience a 7/10, and would be more of a solid 4/5 had it not been for the dirty glasses. I wish I could say that I will save myself the money and make my own Crab Louis, but I sure do appreciate someone else shelling all that crab.<//Review></record>

<text>Came for lunch and enjoyed it. They serve a good range of Italian and seafood dishes.

Seafood was fresh. Pasta was ok tasting but came in huge portions - if you are a small eater, one between two people is enough. Clam chowder was delicious.

Service was great. The seating was a bit small so it was not that comfortable.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx6LIGzS3fZJHupAsFJ7V_zHPvYVjJtsRtNIuq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT4ieqiBGqSl2XUPtmNqp-01qiNiumKFgf5ygX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeltYlkWhH8aYCTTwT6tYAfsUZyphBlIIrEwC-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_C161Q8859NDnOcF43Zx1mAieQTskIR9WLLD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7nMWGw7lFeC5maSKma_AFtv2AmR8SpUUKqNdj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7uEDBliOx1T97UZJVA0ThWhzhc8YKrnbiQbEl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTHapLN_ZJeYhRONpJ4SwLP2HtGmPQJILfT4py=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwieqovdUP8Mct-TGXZaJopj_6O6HNbfZnEqVK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_j_xhLTvfHWL8K0S7dxONRMJGboUq7n8Fnm4T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkZRqFzuMzBerGKJ4G-aUhDvt_j2bO5P5hsNQn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqPZkpJxh9oBVUc-YVosv9bpnuNCPhqqTmaXqM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7D-Z-V5yAOTht3Y8gTiJIae7jQuvjGW3JxskN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUi5y-ziD8QShylx4AF10PCE0_QwPFw13o0bIg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLjjFW5AH26rODGhBcv7kvou1_On21Ds0QwzzJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWvUzpGk7D9dY0erdsnvPWtZTITQLp4TRgKLE3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLNc6XNmgtDV6uN_8XFku1w6zgffWI9JBTjEiQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2E7iBMqkYc5FHdQ9bSJEU5BjF5aUxAK0uWm5f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPim02haZP2_uoB458ZhimJOSQ8LHF8GIUBA4OM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbd736uE4ZNhkUCtOti8nIwBX9P7T9iMp8mxNH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcp0HO6j9YMt9mM4ic55LsCbtJOQldpIELM053=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmKW4s9H4hUO_Fivz8RGoJbGO8pQsl6qgXH4Xb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcPyvbtVAu4sSjXZ3_wsLSt4OF2uplnhbdg8TR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9BX6GGK2o22fPg2f2PY9x1-vP8vCeUdV7jAxD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORUY6V1uCPndpAtNtk-Nx1H0qemQxIW4NPgXQQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPROQoHLyqrZX1k53kG-NAfHvTgalYCkNzBW4Lz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgwThnNNK681R3Rclq5WSZHckual3c4PmXMloU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>A great restaurant a little off the beaten path on Fisherman's Wharf. That is they own their own boats and seafood processing facility across the street. Excellent seafood prepared extremely well! By the way they also make craft cocktails including a Bloody Mary made with house made gin. There are so many places to choose from but even at lunch hour in the middle of the week, this restaurant is very busy. Scoma's was recommended by our cabbie a lifelong resident of San Francisco. Locals surely know it and we were happy that we followed his advice.< /Review><user_name>Keith Brown<//user_name>< userid>

Delicious Fish n Chips!  The batter is made the traditional way. The food is made fresh by order. The portions are generous. My daughter and I shared one order and it was plenty to eat.

Picnic tables are available for seating in front.

This place is a nice addition to the Fisherman's Wharf eateries!< /text>

This place is amazing. The best seafood I have ever had. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth it because the food is fresh. The waiter also put a bib on me because I had white shirt on. Lol. The lazy man is what I ordered and def would recommend this place to all.<//Review>

Well we thought we were going to have a nice dinner experience for our 17th yr anniversary but what we got was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, we were seated in an area where the doors were open its was super cold that we had to wear our coats while dining, when asked if we could have an empty boothe we were refused and were told this was all that was available, hummm that's funny the boothe was left empty the whole time we were there, i don't get it me and my wife pick this establishment for our anniversary dinner and informed them threw our reservation, totally no thought as to seat us to enjoy the experience, the frist drinks were their mule drink that tasted like medicine had to spit out and refuse them.the limes were like old and dried like it had been left out in the sun ,in closing this is not anywhere near a five star restaurant, i would never ever eat there nor suggest it to anyone. I we don't mind paying for anything as long as you get what you pay for .....🙁👎👎👎<//Text>

Definitely I'm coming back here. The best experience I've had. The server Sal was amazing. The food tasted just perfect 😋. This place feels real and right at home. Sal's the best. He reminds me of my grandfather. Thank you for making us feel at home and welcomed.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>We were in seafood heaven! Both the seafood entree and mains were mouth-watering and divine. We couldn't get enough! They matched well with a local chardonnay and the Pisco Punch cocktail. To top it off we had the delicious tiramisu. It was a perfect evening at Scoma's - delightful ambience with excellent and attentive service. Hands down the best meal we had on this trip!
Tip: Make a reservation to avoid waiting for a table (even on a week night) as this place is very busy.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGpvRHOJwjCAA9RD_A_1XFf9ZU2JMR6lKrpfNj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTk3M49lySfuHJ8RoPpzC3U5Mhh02hxELhTGzo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS_nekznhaAErQwucxlKSTZRgAvHCy5GFe8Oa6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI5O9_GUZDFrZDpYAeYZ0xxCvlqbcWwFdxacMG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTIElCZpOsIDtDQigRKk5y2kV9KrCvEZN8fgrK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhbU3Y4NWGM6GVyiQVIvQAluKNheXFmbkd0asz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

FYI, for those looking for post-Covid updates: they have converted part of their parking lot into ocean front dining with 6 feet between each table.

Highly recommended!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCEn23xjTZtReCLYSALEycU-tst7LC-Bj1I67Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnxD53v6NgSiIM3vHmDVPe-u0MY9Eat5jMePWj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjX0BAnRzr4I1GnUgGrJ-3g3D3nQ2CMdx2iOfM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

This place is very rustic and classic! Great place with excellent food! We ordered their shrimp, squid, and crab fried rice. It was so delicious! The taste was amazing and unique in flavors. This is our new favorite Thai restaurant in the city. They also have a unique design and excellent service. I will definitely come back and have that charcoal baby octopuses. Tasty!< /text>

Highly recommend visiting the restaurant. The service was awesome and the food was delicious. If you are at Fisherman wharf definitely stop by but it’s best to make reservations at least a day in advance.</review>

What's good: Clamp chowder soup is delicious and crab was well cooked that maintains the freshness. Great stuff.

Mediocre... Oyster was not fresh. Definitely not worth the money.

What's bad:  Very disappointed with the freshness of the mussels. Filled with ammonia taste.

What's unacceptable: Do not appreciate the jokes of  the waiter who took our order.. sounded condescending to me.</Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Food was very good and very high quality.  Be prepared to wait a while unless you have reservations.  It’s not cheap in any sense - food and cocktails are outrageously priced.  But you knew that already :-)  would’ve given it 5 stars, however two out of three dishes needed salt DESPERATELY.  I know salt is subjective, but as someone that does a lot of cooking I feel like the cook didn’t use any on those dishes.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM81-ex6TI6d3m60Ic2quSrdLeKRmuoYDanSZsu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6apcmDrtuHR2bQSSuRGhdBR9LfZS3iD8rR6Ug=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyev0iNYSy9jwB5l7nhgSlN_-qjWKFl-e-8TlU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Came for lunch and enjoyed it. They serve a good range of Italian and seafood dishes.

Seafood was fresh. Pasta was ok tasting but came in huge portions - if you are a small eater, one between two people is enough. Clam chowder was delicious.

Service was great. The seating was a bit small so it was not that comfortable.</Review>

With so many of the iconic restaurants in the heart of the tourist area closed I was lucky to find Scoma. Sat indoors in the dining room. It was intimate and well appointed. Service!  This was old world service. I can't remember the last time I had service this attentive to detail and my dining experience. The food was excellent. The dining selection is broad and the Chardonnay I selected was perfect. The food was excellent. Scallops were expertly seared, shrimp cocktail was delicious, risotto was just right, dessert snd coffee were an indulgent experience. I loved the entire experience and highly recommend this treasure just steps away from the commercial clatter of the high traffic tourist spots.</Text>

What An AMAZING Experience! My mom and I just finished what I believe to be the best service we have ever had! From the moment we walked into Scoma’s to the moment we left, we were treated with the most warm and wonderful service. The food (fresh caught) was unbelievable! Please do yourself a favour and just order the Crab, hot, in garlic and lemon butter! You will feel like you’re floating on a cloud. I would like to say Thanks again to Our phenomenal server David, you are one of a kind. We will most definitely be back for many years to come!< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>My girlfriend and I were visiting SF and in one place this restaurant was highly recommended to us.  It was a shame to have such a bad experience despite how beautiful this place looks.  The first thing was the poor attention of the waitress, she took the order three meters away, I had to choose a little voice to take my order, besides that she had no interest in explaining the menus well.  Then my girlfriend asked for a salmon and it was raw, this situation was very unpleasant, they offered us to reconcile it but she did not want to continue eating, not even the waitress herself apologized.  not if all this had to do with the time I decided to go, it was like 8:00 pm.  My girlfriend went to the bathroom and it was very dirty.  the truth is that all this is a shame for this well located place.  Hopefully it will improve a bit since the services are not cheap at all, I find it expensive and of very low quality.  I think I would think twice to return here.</review></record>

It was good.  They had outdoor seating and took us without a reservation.  They also brought out a torch lamp so we were not cold.<//Review>

Excellent dinner spot. I'm still salavating looking at my salad from this evening. If you find yourself in San Francisco, then Scoma's is an excellent restaurant that I highly recommend.

Pictured here is the Roasted Beet Salad (Salt Roasted Red and Golden Beets withAvocado, Orange, Aged Balsamic & Fresh Horseradish) along with the Halibut and veggies.</Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Enjoyed the fresh cod. The lemon aioli was amazing! The “seasonal vegetables” on the plate was a frozen diced veggie blend. A little to be desired for the price point. But overall a good experience. Lovely sunset dinner over the Bay; much quieter and less crowded than Pier 39.<//Text>< pictures>

A friend suggested this restaurant to me and I'm so glad she did! First of all, the staff was amazing. They were very friendly and, helpful with suggestions.
Had an amazing margarita to start and had the trio for 2 as an appetizer which includes, calamari, crabcakes and bacon wrapped scallops. Now I am usually not a fan of seafood beyond calamari but the crabcakes were amazing and came with a delicious dipping sauce. Also had a delicious caesar salad.
I had the filet as an entree with asparagus with lemon and it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. One of the best dinners I've had in quite a while.</Text>

<username>Ryan Desch< /username><Text>Darn good seafood! Cocktail was a true delight as well. Great service for a big group as well. Incredible location featuring a large seemingly endless length of restaurant. Very cozy! Great views of SF in any direction. Believe it or not I’m a 40 year old man who had never eaten an oyster in his life, that all changed at Scoma. I was wary but they were delightful! If you’re up this way doing that tourist thing AND you live seafood, then this right here is your spot!< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Been coming here for years. I like this place better than the Sausalito location. We celebrated our 38yr anniversary. My wife wanted to eat here. Cesar salad,  Crab Brisq soup, spicy sauteed calamari, Lazy man's Cioppino and Cod special!!! All was YUM!!!

<Text>Very fresh seafood that they say is sourced from the local fishermen and fisheries. They're generous with the butter and everything is consistent. The first time I came here, I had the louie salad, which was extremely basic. My latest return I tried out their seafood pastas and it was so rich I could die. Definitely something you need lots of bread for, but worth trying. Interior is a little bit nautical and storied with the waiters being attentive and checking in often. It's a bit on a the pricier side, but worth the price.<//Text><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate><userid>100286887734839567886<//userid><user_name>Andrew Jaru<//user_name><Response>{'time': 1557786239429, 'text': "Hi Andrew.

Fantastic service, fantastic food and large serving sizes.
Good conversation with the serving staff too.

Small 15-20min wait for a walk in customer, which was fine. It allowed us to have a couple of drinks at one of the 2 front bars in the meantime prior to our meal.

Would recommend.<//review>

Scoma’s is a must place to visit when in San Francisco. The seafood is impeccable and its preparation respectful. Scoma's has the best crab Louie salad I have ever had anywhere. Their seafood is the freshest, purchased right off the boats steps away from the kitchen. Atmosphere was absolutely amazing. The scallops were perfection as was the calamari. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.< /review>

<review>Everything is fantastic at Scoma's. This is a must if you are in San Francisco, excellent Clam chowder, Caesar salad, and freshest sea food you can get. We love it here, family favorite!

Easy to walk to. It's tucked away from the per noise. The atmosphere reminded me of old San Francisco, dark wood, nice comfy bar stools.

The food and service was Great. And they were able to accommodate the large party of diners that were in attendance with us. Definitely recommend reservations. The food was excellent, the wine selection was superb, and the service was efficient and professional. Highly recommend.< /review>< date>

Best seafood place around. The clam chowder was unreal! Need to visit again just for it! Very fresh seafood but be prepared to shell out a lot from your wallet.</Text>

Some of the best seafood in SF, and the location on the pier cannot be beat. The Cioppino is a must, and the clan chowder is worth the walk over from the more commercial options along the street.< /review>

<text>I've eaten here twice in this trip and both times the food and service were fantastic.
The second time we enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the interactions between the staff who truly seem like a family - with some waiters driving 2 hours to work there!
Candace and Steve behind the bar deserve a big shout out, looking after us, keeping us entertained and giving us Thanksgiving weekend recommendations :)< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBbyKpMZeRidG0a0l9kAg3sHwtW3AYoc3RgG6o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcA0EiUXYlyNcDJjQeajRHwpJzbccfGn7bBL64=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtt7ZRLZrBt7frx7WCksbmnA2KbDC9QrJJ5scv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I love this place. Quintessential San Fran seafood spot. 3rd time here. Waiters are all very professional and provide the best service.

Fantastic seafood and cool location off the beaten path a little and in a boat harbor.

I like the intimate atmosphere. Make your reservations WEEKS in advance.

If you have never been here... you really should try it.< /Text>< rate>

<Text>On a work trip after a full day. We ate dinner here. It was one of the few dining options available to get us out of our hotel room.

They had extra tables setup where parking used to be. So we ate outside. The view was awesome. The service was top notch.

Drinks. Delicious. I had the smoked maple old fashioned. My dining mate (and friend and coworker) had a Southern Comfort and 7up.

Dinner (we couldn't fit dessert) was the grilled king salmon over Scomaronia and the Cioppino.

We ordered a couple apps too. Dungeness crab, oysters and shrimp. All good. All gone.

We so enjoyed our dinner here!

Thank you team Scoma!!

Hopefully you are able to get a new boat soon!!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>If you want to have a good seafood experience not in the 'tourist' area, this is your go place! The food is great and the atmosphere too. But be aware it is a 'posh' place, a bit expensive (around 50 dollars per person) and it is advisable to make a reservation.</Text><UserId.>116030536417254213485</UserId.>< resp>

<Review>Kinda hidden from the Main Street, Scoma's is a restaurant that you need to go!
I'm the kind of person who says don't like fish, but after trying it here I change my mind!!! The worst part is that now, anything thAt I taste will always be comparable to this one!!!
Highly recommended!<//Review>< Name>

We walked in with no reservation at 5:00 on a Saturday and we were in at 5:40... not bad at all.

This place is an icon and for good reason. Always fresh seafood and great servers.  The bar is wonderful too. My favorite dish is the Cioppino. So much food and so flavorful.

Our first visit to San Francisco and Scoma's came highly recommended. It did not disappoint....it was fantastic!  John, our waiter, was terrific.  Gave us some great wine, appy, dinner and after dinner specialty drinks suggestions.  We went with pretty well everything John recommended and we were not disappointed. Terrific service...fantastic food and drinks! Thank you John and a big applause to the chef and staff in the kitchen.....we'll be back!

Thank you!

<text>Came back again and we were not disappointed. Nice outdoor seating. Everything was delish and outshined the $200 meal we had last night and was less costly. Make a reservation and go enjoy yourself.</text>< user_id>

Even with covid-19 I felt safe there I haven't been to any other restaurants around they all wear gloves and masks your Booth is protected with Plexi foxy glass on both sides menu is delicious if you love Seafood my granddaughter and I ordered lots of appetizers and soup the crab cocktail was excellent and actually always eat too much bread there because it's so good the waiter Ray and the backup waiter Tam were kind and helpful try any of the fresh fish that's absolutely fantastic for an appetizer we really loved the heart beet salad so yummy< /text>

<Review>Waiting about an hour on a weekday evening to be seated for dinner. Extremely busy restaurant which impacts the service quality. The service was decent but they could do better.

Food:
Cioppino: generous amounts of fresh dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, squid, and mussels in a fresh tomato sauce. The thing that suprised me was it was pretty much all seafood and loads of it. The tomato sauce was quite plain though.

Oysters alla Scoma: rockafeller style with cheese. A bit too sour for me but my buddy enjyoed it.

Scoma’s Famous Clam chowder: solid chowder and nice junks of seafood but I’ve had better in SF

Overall a nice experience and loved the fresh seafood.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Well, so far best fried calamares! Scallops and fried shrimps was super good, even the rice as a side dish was super tasty! This is an old school place, where waiters know how to get the job done and they are very “familiar with the subjects”😉.<//Text>

Not worth it. The view from the dining room is not that great. The chowder is decent. The calamari didn’t taste fresh and had a thick batter on it. Prices were very high. The kids burger was decent but you can get one just as good at in n out for a 1/3 of the price. This is an old school place with old school food. If that’s what you like then you’ll probably like it but if your a millennial then it’s not your jam.< /Review>

I have deliberated greatly whether to give it 3 or 4 stars.  The ambience is cozy and location is 5 stars and entering this delightful blue and white cottage you're transported to a time when you would be served something wonderful straight from the trawler at the "old" fisherman's wharf. I ordered the spaghetti marinara, my husband the mixed grill and my kids each ordered the fish and chips. I will declare I am Italian so perhaps I'm being harsh... but i thought my food was so so. The portions were very generous and no one left hungry but the food itself, not spectacular.  The service so so and I'm being generous. Perhaps it's because we brought the kids (not exactly a family restaurant) or maybe because we didn't order alcohol but i just felt we got average, perfunctory service. This is what really let it down for us. We ended up tipping 30% anyway ... but we wont be back. Sorry.<//text>

Restaurant had a old school feel to it. We had a trio appetizer plate and mixed seafood dinner. The scallops, crab cake, and fried calamari was a great stater. The mixed seafood was a good dish to share, but some of the fish seemed a bit overcooked/dry. Overall great atmosphere and dinner would way here again when in SF.< /review>

We were treated to a great experience.  The food is everything you would expect from a fresh seafood restaurant, but more. Eat at Scoma's restaurant!

<Review>I was looking for a nice place to eat on the bay, but the restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf looked way too touristic to me. I opted for this more hidden restaurant and I've been positively surprised. First, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. Then the atmosphere, very "marine" with all the wood. Last but not least, the food is great! Fresh fish from the bay, with many different options available. Wasn't expecting this quality. Sure, is not the cheapest option around, but if you want to eat well this i's the place to go!</Review>< pics>

<review>Food was very good and very high quality.  Be prepared to wait a while unless you have reservations.  It’s not cheap in any sense - food and cocktails are outrageously priced.  But you knew that already :-)  would’ve given it 5 stars, however two out of three dishes needed salt DESPERATELY.  I know salt is subjective, but as someone that does a lot of cooking I feel like the cook didn’t use any on those dishes.< /review>< rate>

<review>This was our first time and it was full to the door but we eventually managed to get a seat at the bar. The waiter/bar tender was welcoming and professional. He made us feel at ease. The food was very good though pricey. Will definitely visit again next time we are in San Francisco.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

Everything is fantastic at Scoma's. This is a must if you are in San Francisco, excellent Clam chowder, Caesar salad, and freshest sea food you can get. We love it here, family favorite!

Easy to walk to. It's tucked away from the per noise. The atmosphere reminded me of old San Francisco, dark wood, nice comfy bar stools.

The food and service was Great. And they were able to accommodate the large party of diners that were in attendance with us. Definitely recommend reservations. The food was excellent, the wine selection was superb, and the service was efficient and professional. Highly recommend.<//Review>

No frills, except for the food. The food was fresh, uniquely prepared, and absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is authentic and worn; I wouldnt have it any other way.</Review>

Kind of overrated as far as the fish... It was ok but I was surprised that my dish was deep fried - seems like a cop-out, and it was really dry. I would 100% come back for their amazing afogato (best I've ever had!), the cocktails (best negroni!) and the service.<//Review>

<Text>This place is an icon and for good reason. Always fresh seafood and great servers.  The bar is wonderful too. My favorite dish is the Cioppino. So much food and so flavorful.

Always busy so reservations are important.<//Text>< pictures>

Up until tonight, I always loved this place. In fact, I had made a commitment to patronize local restaurants that remained open during the Shelter in Place order to help them during this crisis. Scoma's was one of those places. I had ordered "curbside delivery" a couple of times, no problem. Drive up, someone comes out, takes your card, goes inside and runs the check, and then comes right back with your bill to sign and your bag of food. And away you go. I might add that the service was always masked and gloved.

So tonight, I called in an order, arrived in my car at the time I said I would be there. Someone was there to tell me where to park, and there I sat with absolutely no acknowledgement from the staff inside for the next 15 minutes! Meanwhile, there was a birthday party going on right in front of me, and they received two full food deliveries while I was sitting there!

The same parking guy walked by again and I finally got his attention. He went in to check on my order, and a girl came and informed me that I had to COME INSIDE AND PAY to get my order - OH REALLY? SINCE WHEN? What happened to the "curbside delivery" that you have advertised on your website, and that I've patronized at least twice without any problem? She then informed me that it was because I called my order in rather than ordering online - RIGHT! I called my orders before without any problems, so I knew that wasn't it. She finally admitted that they were busy - evidently too busy to handle the transaction as advertised. OK, well then I'm too busy to be your customer! I told her to skip it and drove away without my order.

So this is how you treat your neighborhood patrons who were loyal to you during the SIP? Suddenly the SIP order's relaxed and  you're letting people into your restaurant to order and pay, and people are standing around in the parking lot, less than six feet apart and no masks, partying and getting all your service. I see. And now I hope some of my neighbors will see, too. SHAME ON YOU. If that's how you're going to treat loyal customers, then you will never get my business again. SHAME. ON. YOU!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>
{'time': 1592259196011, 'text': "Hi Stefanie. Thank you so much for your kind words on always loving us and we greatly appreciate your efforts to support us during the SIP. We're happy to know your two initial curbside delivery experiences went so well, but please accept our apologies for the items you described on your most recent visit. We looked into what happened there and unfortunately it was a perfect storm of getting slammed and not having the proper training for the staff that was on hand at the time. We do happily offer curbside service and do handle the transactions as advertised. It will not happen again. Next time you order or come by, please introduce yourself so we can apologize in person and make sure you have a 100% perfect experience. Thank you and we look forward to serving you again."}<//resp>

<Text>Delicious food, great staff. If you don't know what to get try the seafood cioppino. A tasty classic. There are nice view of the harbor boats from the restaurant. I ate at the bar are the service was professional and friendly. The bar tender showed me the menu and popular items. There is a lot to choose from and I was unsure and he recommended a few items. When I tried to add an app he suggested an alternative because it would simply be too much crab meat. He did so curteously and I'm glad I followed his advice. Valet parking is available if you are driving.<//Text><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmap_id>< Time>

Was told this was the place to go for seafood in San Francisco. The wife and I went during a recent trip and even at 2pm in the afternoon, there was a wait. We both ordered the crab and even though it was messy, it was a fun experience.< /Review>

<Time>1592067396032</Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>This restaurant shares the pier with fishing boats (that also pay rent) and park here so that we can all get fresh fish. It's a pier after all. Now they want to stop the boats from being there and that's very unfair. These are hard times for everyone we all need to innovate and yes they might need some more outdoor space but also be reasonable and share. I would like to hear a reasonable explanation from the new management.<//text>< Pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1592089091527, 'text': 'Catherine, please know Scoma\'s is perhaps the biggest supporter of the local fishing fleet in the entire city. We are more than happy to have any fishing boat being on the pier and several do. We have been letting FV Pioneer sell seafood in our parking lot, which we pay for, at no cost to them. We have no ability, desire or authority to put anyone out of business, and the Pioneer could easily move to a different slip if it wanted to.\n\nIt is an unfortunate situation but we have well over 100 employees, many local fishing crews and countless farmers whose livelihoods depend on our being able to conduct business. After offering several solutions to the FV Pioneer no agreement could be reached.\n\nPlease read this unbiased statement from the Port of San Francisco if you are interested in knowing the facts of the situation.\n\nThank you for your feedback we we hope this response and the Port\'s statement below gives you clarity on the situation.\n\nStatement issued by the Port of San Francisco yesterday:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\n\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\n\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\n\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nFor additional information please contact the Port of San Francisco Public Affairs Office.'}</Response><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I'm a local, and I eat on the San Francisco waterfront often. This is definitely one of the best meals I've had near the Pier 39 / fisherman's wharf area.

Fried calamari was very good, although it could have been just a touch more crispy.

Crispy fries with truffle oil and parmesan cheese were out of this world.

The beet salad was small for the price, but tasted amazing.

The bread roll tasted fresh, but it was not warm.

Service was fast and friendly. I was dining alone and I got one of the tables facing out toward the fishing boats.

The location makes this one of those places that you will not stumble onto. You must see the sign and walk toward the Bay down the pier.

The restaurant is like time stopped in 1965, but it's clean and well-maintained inside.

food is expensive, but not over-the-top expensive. I ordered three appetizers, calamari, crispy fries, and the beet salad. And with two diet Pepsi's it came to $51, before tip.

I will definitely be back here.< /text>

<Review>We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service. Mid week we were able to get in without a reservation but I think any other time it would be prudent. The beet salad was light and tasty. We shared a seafood stew with a side of polenta that I highly recommend for enjoying the delicious tomato-based broth. The seafood tasted fresh and was perfectly cooked.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

i dined here one evening with my mom while in town for a quick weekend away. we showed up with no reservation and sat at the bar until we were able to be seated. we ordered a drink at the bar and enjoyed the area while waiting. there's a really nice bar. the drinks are a bit pricey though. we were seated and our waitress took our order quickly. i ordered the meal that had 3 types of fish and it was great. the fish was really fresh and cooked well. i would recommend!<//Text>

Came for lunch on a whim with no reservations (I recommend doing otherwise!) we were able to grab a seat at the bar. Had delicious chowder, crab and more! We saw a few seals swimming around outside too! Service was excellent and price is really what you would expect for the high quality of food you’re getting and it’s also San Fran so yah know.< /Text>

<review>Walked in without a reservation during a business trip. They had a bit of a wait but we found a few seats at the bar and only had one round before our table was ready. Nice surprise as I was expecting to wait much longer. Ordered the mixed seafood grill and a bottle of wine and was very pleased with everything. Service was great as well. Will make sure to come back on future trips to San Francisco.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Got here around 6pm dinner time, no waiting, got seated right away, got served right away, and drinks brought very quickly, ordered bowl of chowder for appetizer, and for the main we ordered lazy man's cioppino  and pasta puttanesca, very delicious but both dish taste similar in a tomato-ey way, still delicious, the prawn is just outta this world, seafood taste really fresh, service is great, price is incredibly high, about 110$ for two, yet great service, great food, great view, have that fancy vibe, great experience overall<//Review><user_id>104505643480411854047< /user_id>< date>

I understand most of the staff members have decades of service.  Our server was absolutely wonderful!  Scoma’s seafood is about as fresh as it gets and the cooking was perfect.

Great seafood! Old school atmosphere and charm. This place is a San Francisco icon. Kinda pricey, and the martini pours could be a bit bigger, but other than that, this is a top notch place to go. Definitely make reservations as it gets packed!</Text>

<review>A family favorite and tradition every we time  we come to San Francisco. My grandpa came here for decades and it was a great way to honor his memory by bringing some of my friends here.

Good but way too expensive, small portions. More than $30 dlls for that small cold seafood platter with 4 Oysters, 4 Shimps and a little bit of Crab, is a rip off!<//text>

<Text>A good friend highly recommended this establishment.  When my husband phoned about reservations, he was assured that we could walk-in without a wait. Upon arrival, we were told that there would be a wait of 30-45 minutes. This was after a party of 6 walked up immediately before us without a reservation and was seated. We then went to the bar to wait on our table.  Mikey the bartender was kind and efficient and those at the bar were so nice that we eventually chose to eat there. We were practically done with our meal when we were notified that our table was ready. Mikey tried to cover for the mistake but obviously those assigning tables did not care to us.  Given our $200 bill, it was not worth it. Never again.<//Text>< gmapID>

Enjoyed the oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer, perfectly cooked. The grilled seafood platter was ok. Two of the 3 fish  were overcooked and the black cod had bones in it. The shrimp was perfectly cooked.</Text>

The best crab louie salad and clam chowder in the City, period.  And that says a lot given the number and quality of the competition.  The waiters are always super social; so we always have a great time when we go.</Text>

Loved Scoma's.  Easy to walk to. It's tucked away from the per noise. The atmosphere reminded me of old San Francisco, dark wood, nice comfy bar stools, friendly staff and excellent food.   The  crab bisque was awesome,  but the smokey maple old fashion was surprisingly great.  Looking forward to returning on my next trip to SF.< /text>

Good staff and fresh seafoods on there. In addition, they provided a variety of wine lists and you can choose one that you like.
Because there is located in the central of fisherman's Wharf, I felt a little pricy than I expected. Recommended.< /text>

<Text>The food at Scoma’s is quite simply phenomenal- the scallops are the best I’ve ever eaten and the halibut was perfectly cooked and accompanied. The only downside was the service - which was bad- our server spoke maybe ten words to us in total - we had to ask for our starter plates to be cleared (after our mains had arrived) and for fresh cutlery. We still had a wonderful meal as nothing can detract from the food here - but clearing tables, a smile and couple of friendly words makes a difference between a good and a great experience.</Text>< pics>

Professional waiters with eye for detail. Cozy interior to stick around for couple of hours. They are very upfront on what is fresh and what comes out of the freezer depending on the daily deliveries. The Alaskan halibut was delicious.<//text>

Soooo good. This is the best place for Cioppino around.  It was extra cool that local fishermen were seated next to me at the bar who brought in some of the fish that day.< /Text>

Classic seafood restaurant has been in town since 1965. We only had a Cioppino as afternoon snack. Cioppino was full of fresh seafood and nicely done. Delicious....!!! Want to come back here for more deliciousness.</review>

Loved finding this gem off the beaten path. The food was delicious. We are from New England and agree that the Clam Chowder was phenomenal! The service was excellent. Our server was Han Kim, I am not sure of spelling. She was so attentive and even funny. She made us feel comfortable and was very accommodating to our requests. Highly recommend and will be back if in the area.< /Review>

The whole roasted crab was served in a lemon herb butter sauce: delicious! The bread was served cold (like from the refrigerator) which I thought was weird. I asked for it to be warmed up and was told no. So there's that...< /Text>

The place is classy with excellent service.  Prices are a tad high, but you get what you are paying for.  The food is absolutely delicious.  If you are craving for fish, this is the place to go.

The only downside to the restaurant is that it is a bit small, so I recommend reserving a table if you do not want to wait.</Review><user>111146399460078326827< /user>< Name>

<Text>We have been coming to Scoma's during family visits to San Francisco practically since the restaurant opened in 1965. The setting on the wharf is very special, and the jacketed waiters are exactly the way I remember them back in the 1960s.  They are also very helpful and efficient!  The food is good, but it's really the whole experience that makes Scoma's such a treat.< /Text><Time>1581465165448< /Time><Pics>None< /Pics><name>Tom Hay Bauer</name><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Came here for dinner with my colleagues. They have a nice California craft beer list an extensive wine list (hot take: they also have a list available in Japanese). The service here was good. The food here was quite good. We all shared a seafood feast. The price point is about right for the area, that being said bring your wallet.<//text>

<text>Scoma’s is a must place to visit when in San Francisco. The seafood is impeccable and its preparation respectful. Scoma's has the best crab Louie salad I have ever had anywhere. Their seafood is the freshest, purchased right off the boats steps away from the kitchen. Atmosphere was absolutely amazing. The scallops were perfection as was the calamari. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.<//text>< pictures>

Good but way too expensive, small portions. More than $30 dlls for that small cold seafood platter with 4 Oysters, 4 Shimps and a little bit of Crab, is a rip off!</text>

Super expensive for some very meh food. My family ordered 3 different dishes and all of them were either okay or downright bad. I'm sure this restaurant was amazing when they opened 30 years ago, but I don't think they've updated since.< /text>

I had a quick pre Birthday bite.  We just shared a salad and appetizers.  The crab cakes were delicious.  The calamari's corn meal breading was odd to me.  Not fine milled and I wasn't expecting the texture.  The bacon wrapped scallops were tasty but seemed warm. They would've been better with a little more heat...like a little sizzle or something.  The one thing I did enjoy but did not photograph was the Casa Margarita.  It would be one of the reasons I'd go back.  The atmosphere was nice and very old San Fran.  Although it is in the Wharf, it is a bit off the beaten track so you don't feel like you are hanging out with a bunch of tourists.  Many apologies if that offends, I just hate being with the masses.  I know...I should share such a wonderful city, but I'm selfish that way 😇.<//review>

<Review>Very nice place, you definitely need a reservation or to get on the waitlist ahead of time. It's more of an older crowd, slow pace but very beautiful and elegant.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Ordered four different dishes with the family, all came out great quality. Staff we met were very friendly and welcomed us as tourists. This place is so good, the popularity would probably require a reservation on busy days! Luckily, we did have a reservation, and we got seated right when we walked in.</Text><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures><name>Ryan Feldman</name>< date>

<Text>In my opinion this has to be one of the best restaurants in the US. Tucked away down a small street at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, Scoma's is like finding buried treasure. The restaurant itself is not overly ostentatious but the warm friendly staff make you feel imediately welcome.
I tried out Fettucine “Pomodori Secchi e Pollo”. Now I have eaten Pasta dishes in around 16 countries, including Milan, Italy. I have to say, this was the best chicken pasta dish I have ever tasted. It was sublime. Its no surprise, whereever you look that this particular restaurant has reviews of 4.5 stars and over. My rating is a full 5* and that it is my number 1 restaurant in the US so far. If you are ever in the area don't miss an opportunity to pay Scoma's a visit.</Text>< Pics>

Everything is delicious, and the service is incredibly top notch ❤️ This place is definitely the best of the best as far as local seafood restaurants. However, their food is, in my opinion, overpriced by a noticeable margin. 2 crab cakes as an appetizer was very delicious, but not $21 delicious.<//text>

It was our first time in SF & we had been craving clam chowder all day (at this point it had been a brisk evening) & Scomas absolutely delivered (figuratively speaking). Not only was their food delicious, but their customer service and employees were very cordial. Candace especially went above and beyond to say the least. Shoutout to Candace!!! To say she made our first experience with Scomas eventful is an understatement. When you mix flavor packed, good quality food with even better quality employees, you obtain long time customers. Definitely will be coming back here every time I visit SF.< /Text>

Very cool location on the Fisherman's Wharf. The drinks were great. I had a gin & prosecco drink with cucumber. It was delish.  The crab cakes were awesome too.  Everyone enjoyed their food...but beware that the menu on their website is NOT correct.  They did not have a dish that someone in our party wanted, even though the online menu showed it was available.</Text>

<review>Wow, talk about fresh.  Our waiter (Chris) guided our group on a fantastical journey of fresh seafood.  The seafood trio sampler and bruschetta were simply amazing.  I ordered the mixed seafood grill (the daily fish were halibut, salmon, and black cod) and was probably some of the best fish I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Can be pricey, but you get a healthy, filling portion.  Highly recommend.</review>< UserId.>

<review>Beautiful view or a cannery row view with Ghirardelli in the background.

Jean Marc was our server. Gracious, welcoming,  knowledge, old school finesse. Loved him. Drinks, Bloody Mary was best out of all I've had, rich well blended flavors, dirty martini was well balanced and dirty. Every order from apps to dessert served well prepared and timely. Old school ambiance in a thoroughly modern world.<//review>< Pics>

Decided to eat at the bar instead of waiting an hour for a table for 2. Good decision because the bartender C. C. was a jewel! She gave us the best recommendations! Clam Chowder was loaded with fresh clams and so good with no bacon. Calamari fritti was lightly coated with rice flour and tender. Caprisi salad with heirloom tomatoes and homemade mozzarella was fantastic. Cioppino was loaded with seafood and delicious. Wrapped it up with 7 layer Torta Setteveli cake; light, chocolatey and creamy. A new favorite instead of Tiramisu.< /Text>

Great location tucked away along the dock.  Old Italian style.  The steak was amazing.  The tri appetizer was great and loved by our 7yo and 9yo. We also had scallops and shrimp.  Our kids loved it all.  It was cooked nicely and our server was very nice.  I had a body Mary which was a tad lacking in pizzazz.  It was not worth the $15 they charged for it.  Other than that, it is a great restaurant and I highly recommend it!</text>

While all the seafood around the wharf is likely fresh, at Scoma's not only do you know it is but the service and preparation they put into each meal is unmatched. Our server dutifully told us exactly which dishes were locally caught and prepared fresh vs frozen. I started with the clam chowder and can honestly say it was one of the best I ever had. For entrees, my wife and I had the locally caught, fresh blackened cod.  Perfectly cooked and spiced, it was so good, I had to slow myself down to enjoy it more...as well as stop myself from just going caveman on it and eating it with my bare hands. Also, as a bonus, our awesome waiter (who had previously asked what brought us to San Fran after learning that we lived in NJ) brought us some incredible sorbet and ice cream to congratulate us on our marriage/honeymoon. This added an entire new level to our experience. When we are in San Fran again, we will definitely be returning!< /Review>< pics>

I loved how this amazing little place filled with folks seeking fresh seafood!!!! Incredibly attentive staff and our group loved each of their chosen dinners. Right on the dock at FW, with a beautiful view of the Harbor looking toward the Golden Gate Bridge.
Recommend the Tito's Moscow Mule. Can't wait to return.<//Review>

This was the first place we ate at after landing from Florida on our honeymoon. This historic restaurant has great views and dishes. We loved the chowder and crab cakes. On the back wall next to the harbor, you'll find a plethora of celebrity photos who have enjoyed this cuisine with you. I would highly recommend.< /text>

I haven't been to Scoma's in about 5 years (I live in Texas), but it was and is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. And I have eaten in many of the finest restaurants in the U.S. I was wondering if Joey Scoma still frequents the facility. He was a big part of the Scoma's experience.</Review>

<text>I have only tried Scoma's once about a year ago (Apparently I forgot to leave a review at the time) and this past year I have thought about Scoma's over hundreds of times.

Every dish we ordered was beyond expectation and really became my default point of comparison when trying other restaurants. All the food was incredibly fresh and seasoned perfectly.

Service was absolutely fantastic and our server even gave us extra mini Tabasco bottles just by overhearing us talk about how adorable they were.

Our seating was unfortunately very small (right in the corner of the bar area) but truly a trivial matter when it comes to our great experience dining here.

Hope to visit again soon!<//text>< pictures>

Great drinks & awesome food.  It's off the path, but so worth the walk. Lazy Man's cioppino is the bomb.</review>

<review>Three is being generous. Traveling in San Francisco and Scoma's was highly recommended by our hotel staff and the glowing Google reviews. Our waiter, Timothy was less than interested in us as customers, not helpful in advising us on menu selections and overall, just a dud.  We should have asked to change to the waiter people nearby had- he was outgoing, knowledgeable and sold the menu items with skill and was not pushy. As for our entrees, my shrimp and scallops were OK, my client got the mixed grill which was over cooked and on a par with hotel banquet fare. Dessert was limited, and the tiramisu was suspiciously like what Olive Garden served. For nearly $200, this was disappointing. The salmon mac and cheese was actually great, so possibly I should have settled for this and a salad. We did enjoy the location and decor, and might (?) give Scoma's another try, with the hope this was just an "off" evening.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Not easy to find, the clam chowder was fantastic! I live in socal so do not get up north often but glad I was able to visit this place. Crab cakes had great flavor.

Be sure to get the clam chowder, you will be happy you did.

Will be back for sure!<//Review>

Let me start by saying coming from NY especially near many Italian and seafood inspired places I came in with very high expectations.  Although the food was good by many standards, it was not WOW.  Typical seafood fare, and flare.  Service was fast, courteous, and prices were what one would expect for the area and for seafood.  I had a plate of pasta and assorted seafood.  Seafood was fresh tasting and the pasta was good.  I also has a cup of the crab bisque which was very rich and filling- the highlight of the night.  My fiance had a grilled platter of assorted fish- which was light, flaky but nothing to rave about.  All in all, if you're in the mood for seafood I would recommend Scoma.  However, if you're in the mood for dishes incorporating seafood to set a new bar- I'd say try somewhere else.< /review>

<Text>Food is a 5 star.  Was excellent and the service was excellent as well.  Again 5 stars.  So why a 3 star rating.  I was seated in a small room in the back of the restaurant.  Attached to this room with no separation was a waiter service area.  You know coffee makers, drink machines.   Wasn't too bad until they started bussing table in the larger dining room and walking though the small dining room.  Then making a lot of racket racking and stacking dirty dishes.   If I wanted a nice view of a food prep area with a lot of noise I would have gone to Denny's.  I didn't complain during the meal as it was my wife's birthday and I didn't want to upset her my complaining.

With that said, food is good just watch out where they seat you.<//Text><Name>Anonymous Remailer<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>I don’t dish out 5-star reviews often but this place deserved it. Incredible food and excellent service. As someone who comes from Europe and struggles with huge American portions, this place was reasonable when we ordered an appetiser to share and a starter each (came to about regular European portions). Recommend crab cakes - you get two with a little side salad/generous garnish, and the clam chowder (go for a bowl rather than a cup for a European ‘main’ size) and crab bisque.

Delicious, fresh, excellent! Usually recommended to reserve, we got lucky and walked in without a reservation. But a place this good will be busy - so either reserve or be prepared for a wait - it is worth it tho.</text><user_name>Kristine< /user_name>< Response>

The absolute best white, creamy clam chowder. Delicious. Friendly staff and on the water ambiance. You won't find lots of potatoes as filler for the chowder here.</review>

If you're looking for decent seafood and excellent ambiance this is the place to go. Had the cioppino, TONS of seafood in it, sauce was a little bland bu the atmosphere and view make up for it.</review>

This place is a MUST! My absolute favorite place to eat in San Francisco! The clam chowder is the best I've ever had. You can watch the fishing boats pull up and unload their catch as you dine. I've been eating here since I was a little kid. It hasn't changed a bit in 40 years.</review>

This is as genuine as it gets! The best Crab-cakes ever in the hole wide world( my wife agrees). The «Lazy Man’s Cioppino» it’s wort
an 11 hour flight by it self. The service was outstanding, and intelligent. Thank you Scoma,

<rating>5</rating><text>I am from Massachusetts. Our limo driver in Boston suggested this place! All the way from Massachusetts someone was talking about this place. Location a 10! The food is all organic and the fish's wild and fresh. I got the halibut, my dad got the pasta Bolognese, and my mother and son at the scallops and shrimp. All dishes were a 10. The bread was excellent, and the service was a 10. We had Elizabeth. She was fun, efficient, and knowledgeable. We loved it here.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The clam chowder was absolutely amazing, as was the bread. Once we were served anything we suddenly had no server or at least no recognizable server any longer. That would be my only complaint; service was lacking.</Review>

Nice place to go every few years.  They have their own fishing boats so most of the  fish is fresh. Three of us went for a birthday and with an apetizer for three, a salad and a main course each, no drinks or desserts, it came to  $187.00 before tip.
The service was great and our waiter was very helpful and friendly, but it's not very affordable except for special occasions.<//review>

The crab bisque to start was outstanding. It was downhill from there. Shell bits in my crab cocktail. Shrimp was slightly over for main course but the scallops were perfect. Plating and vegetables with the main, straight from 1965 when they opened. Wait staff? All from 1965 too I think. Not attentive to diners around me, got hit in the shoulder without apology twice as they walked by, and no sense of urgency. Very fresh seafood is about all this place has going for them.</review>

Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}</Response><UserId.>116893164318683976555</UserId.>< Name>

The crab thermidor is basically an overpriced mushroom casserole with virtually no crab and an overall earthy flavor due to being 90% mushrooms. Yet another shining example of how Bay area seafood is horribly outclassed by literally any and every hole in the wall on the Gulf coast. Scomas is probably fine if you've never had fish and only vaguely know what seafood is.<//text>

Ordered some hot and cold plate appetizers and then the dungeoness crab. It was really messy but amazing! So much of the menu is brought in right from the docks and processed in a building steps away from the restaurant. The ambiance was classy and the servers were very friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. If you're looking for a good seafood option, this is a great choice away from the tourist traps.<//Text>

<name>Cheryl John< /name><Review>Don’t go! We went because of the reviews. The food is mediocre at best! The calamari was horrible, chewy.. worst I’ve had. The plates they served the food on had old food on the bottom of it. The waiter was annoyed when we asked for a clean plate. The main course, Fish, was decent.. but for 2 people with 1 drink and no desert the bill was $120.. I got higher quality food at the quick serve walk up at the wharf! They must pay people do the reviews. Don’t go!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

We would have been happy to replace any item you did not find perfect for you, although our calamari is one of our most popular dishes. Please know we only serve the most sustainable fish that is delivered daily to us right at our own pier. It is caught by our own boat or other local fishermen who adhere to the strict Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program for sustainability. It's unlikely you'll find more commitment to sustainable seafood anywhere. Please accept our apologies if you had a dish with food on the bottom of it. That is very unusual as we utilize the finest commercial dishwashers available in the industry. Hopefully we will see you back some day and we'll help you choose items you will love."}</Response>

My family and I were there yesterday, we got seated right away but it took 10min for a waiter to come to our table, he came because my uncle called him to clarify something on the menu. I wonder how long we would have waited if my uncle wouldn't have called. The guy looked at us as if he had no interest of serving us. I guess we were not his class of customers. We were treated very poorly.<//Review>

See if you can find it.
Worth the search.
The cioppino is fantastic
The Crab louis was split between 3 people and we still struggled to finish due to the generous portion. Highly recommended a visit.
Right out of the 70's decor.
Really cool find.
Bloody Mary's were boring. Stick with the wine.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I was recommended this place since I am visiting the area with family. All I can say is it’s definitely worth the wait and it’s very good food. Our waiter was very nice and came to find us when we were told a 30 minute wait. We got to sit next to the fireplace and look out at the water and see all the interesting fishing boats for the pier.
I had the fried combo platter which was delicious. The prawns and cod were cooked perfectly and were not heavy at all considering it’s a fried dish. Normally this dish comes with scallops but I cannot eat scallops and they very kindly swapped them out for more prawns.
This place is good for both locals and travelers. The cost is good for the fresh food you find here. Definitely recommended!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Disappointing. Waited two hours for a table after being told it would be a one-hour wait, there was a couple already seated at the first table they walked us to, the next they were literally setting up in the walkway for us. Ordered an appetizer but dinner came out first so never got to try it. Food was great, only reason for any stars, but not much better than the other places we dined during our stay.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Talk about service. Very nice, on the water. 5 star service.
Sonny was our server. He was very professional had lots of suggestions for first timers.
The Bar Tenders were very nice, but the drinks are typically light in Bay area quantity.
I get more for my money at the bars where I live.
This was a nice place for my Birthday. Really cool photos of famous Celebrities over the years who have dined there.
Great story about My Scoma, i enjoyed in the lobby

<text>Discovered this place while visiting San Francisco. It is just off the main drag, so it is easy to miss, if you aren't looking for it, specifically. That is a good thing. The restaurant is quieter and much higher quality food than the places among the main road. The history behind this place is fascinating.

The seafood is fresh caught and delicious.

The staff was very friendly.

I did not have a reservation, but I arrived early enough that I only had about a 20 minute wait. Call ahead if you want to guarantee a timely seat.

I will definitely go back next time im in the city.< /text>< Pics>

Probably the finest restaurant  in San Francisco.  The staff is very polite  and make you glad you came. The food is to die  for. The best seafood in the Bay Area. The chef's  do a great  job of preparing the food as you ordered lt. No ready made  meals here. Everything is cooked to order.  The restaurant  is very clean and neat. Top it all off they park your car for free. It's not cheap but we'll worth the price. I've been coming to Scoma's for over 50 years never been disappointed.< /text>

<review>Great seafood! I had the fried platter with the prawns, scallops band fresh cod! It was served with fries and a small side of slaw. I didn't care for the slaw, but everything else on the plate was delicious! Our waiter was friendly and provided us with excellent service. I
We had their 7 layer cake for dessert, it was delicious!</review></record>

Amazingly fresh and seasonal menu.  Cannot go wrong with the crab cakes but also a well prepared filet with grits instead of a potato base.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  5 stars if service was better for the smaller tables. Food is well worth any wait.</review>

I was conducting my San Francisco Photo Tours for my Florida clients and a Lyft Driver recommended Scoma's for the best clam chowder in San Francisco. The restaurant was hard to find but we finally found it. Service was real slow when we arrive like 9 pm. It was busy and we finally got our clam chowder. Lots of black/white celebrity photos on the wall. And also the Bar area was really nice and quiet and luxurious.  This place has history and prices are $$$ so be sure to have at least $ 100 in your wallet. It's worth a visit on your next trip to San Francisco</Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>We have been coming to Scomas for decades. We moved away from CA to N. Carolina, so we came to eat on a visit back. The food was fantastic and our service was impeccable as always. We asked for special orders from the old menu, which they made for us. I am glad they are now committed to sustainability, but the prices had gone up a lot and the portion sizes have gone down. The price increase, along with the smaller portions is the reason for 4 stars rather than 5. I can see one or the other, but not both. The price increase for the seafood saute was 30%!</review>< pictures>

Outstanding food and service!!! We actually didn't know where to eat and some nice man on the street recommended Scoma's. It pays to be brave to ask a complete stranger for a dinner recommendation!! The food was crazy good and our server (Heather, I think) what quite honestly one of the best servers we ever had.<//text>

A classic plate to pier experience. Smart service, atmospheric. Pricey but then again San fran is so probably not compared to other comparable places. It was an experience we enjoyed as tourists. The scallops were amazing.</Review>

Went here for the chiopino.   Was not disappointed.   Service very good, timely, attentive, knowledgeable.

Anything from the sea is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ here.

All salads and soups....are ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.

Old school crab Louie... I always order this classic salad... It's the best here at Fisherman's Wharf.  Enjoy the fresh sourdough bread & butter.  Service is fantastic.  Ask to sit at Chris, Tim or Kevin's area.  You'll be treated superbly!< /Text>

< Review>
I was conducting my San Francisco Photo Tours for my Florida clients and a Lyft Driver recommended Scoma's for the best clam chowder in San Francisco. The restaurant was hard to find but we finally found it. Service was real slow when we arrive like 9 pm. It was busy and we finally got our clam chowder. Lots of black/white celebrity photos on the wall. And also the Bar area was really nice and quiet and luxurious.  This place has history and prices are $$$ so be sure to have at least $ 100 in your wallet. It's worth a visit on your next trip to San Francisco<//Review>

Food: Calamari was overcooked and very tough. House seafood soup was delicious. There was a lot of food in the Poor Man's Chopionno. I don't think it was worth it for the money paid though.

Atmosphere: Right on the docks. Feels like it

Service: Pretty Good</Review>

I'm an SF local, so this isn't a place I would normally visit. However, after visiting with my family, I can say that this place is worth a trip. The location out on the pier gives it a truly classic SF feel. Looking back at the city and out toward the Bay is spectacular. The decor is dated, but charming. The food is very good (but not great). Come to this place for the classic experience and you won't be disappointed.</review>

Love this place!  came here over 10 years ago for the first time, and fell in love with  the food and the view. The walls of the restaurant are full of photos from the old days, gives you a great sense of history.  even after left the Bay Area, I always reserve some time to have a meal at Scomas. I have to admit that this restaurant never lets me down.<//text>

<Text>The shrimp I just had here was rubbery and tasteless, vegetables (green beans and carrots) were undercooked.  Our family has been going to this restaurant since the 60's.  It has officially been removed from our list of "places to eat in SF". Oh, the clam chowder was amazing.<//Text>< Pics>

I'm genuinely confused by how highly rated this is. Even for the fisherman's wharf or Pier 39, the food was pretty terrible. The clam chowder was alright if you could overcome the grittiness of what I assumed was poorly cleaned clams. I will say that the truffle fries were good, but slightly oily. I got the petrale dore, which was recommended by our waiter, and it was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this dish unless you like to pay $35 for oily, deep fried cardboard. The only redeeming thing on the plate was the tartar sauce, but that wasn't enough to cover the horrendous taste of the petrale. When I told the staff who took my staff that I didn't want leftovers a sit was just not good, nothing was done about it. Seriously, make the trek to Woodhouse, Waterbar, or anywhere on the grotto if you want good seafood.<//Review>

I had the sole, it was great. House made tarter sauce. Wife had Pasta that included shrimp, mussels, and clams. Tomato based sauce, was spicy for her. Laid back, amazing service. Highly rexrecomm reservations, as we were leaving most were having a 45 to 60 minute wait for walk in.</review>

Always a great experience. The team in this restaurant is just as good as its food, which is a high standard to meet. When it's halibut season, order the halibut; otherwise go for the swordfish. You'll never be disappointed! Also, who doesn't love wine on tap???< /Review>

Terrible bartender looked high. I ordered a salad, I was served 3 pieces of huge lettuce with 3 croutons. When I asked for balsomec vignette they gave me a cup of oil.Don't EVEN ask for steak sauce, they do not have any. The portions are smaller then ever. I love crab that is why I traveled 3 hours to eat THERE! Food is NOT WORTH $160.00<//Review>

Y U M !
I bring any and all seafood lovers here. It is one of my happy places in San Francisco. Clam Chowder is a must for a start. Calamari is cooked almost perfectly every time - it has been over cooked before (reason for me giving 4 stars) I recommend ordering a whole crab with the garlic butter sauce on the side so it doesn’t drink down to your elbows like it did me. The cod dish is delicious, cooked to perfection, flavors are out of this world.</Review>

Scoma is heavenly.  Be patient and have a grand  time.  I had the A Scoma's original  Cioppino. all the crab, scallops, muscles clams is like poetry in motion on your taste buds.  The attentive waiter suggest the most wonderful red wine that set a great evening into motion.  Everyone is friendly no matter how busy they are.< /text>

Oh lord!  I can't remember what every item was called, but the best thing I had there was their take on oysters rockefeller.  I'm getting super hungry thinking about it.  All their apps were great.  As for the entrees, we ordered the clam pasta and roasted cracked crab.<//Text>

It lived up to its reputation. This was some of the best food we had had on our vacation. There are no chowders in bread bowls here. Only delicious, no-nonsense local fish dishes. The children’s meal was fantastic since it included not just fish and fries but also greens and carrots!  And, what’s more, it was served on an actual plate! (Unlike many children's meals.) It’s not cheap but it’s much better value than some other local restaurants. Would very highly recommend.< /review><time>1503033880806</time><user_id>106870092719993616688</user_id></record>

A must go seafood delight!  Been going for 25 years, love the Oysters Ala Scoma.  Great drinks with weekly new creations you should try. Huge wine selections.  Go with the fresh catch or their recommendations. The hard part is getting a seat but they take reservations! See you there! Just returned to the same excellent food this week.</Review>

I wish I could eat here more often.  I drive the two hours from my home, parking by valet, short walk to entrance, located next to Pier 39.  The best scallops ever!  What can I say - it's always what I order.  Bar seating, view of fishing boats, and an occasional seal swimming by.</review>

<Text>By the fishing docks in San Francisco. It is a good quality fish restaurant in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Get your fish next to area where the fishers unload their stock. Talk to the fishermen and fisherwomen, if you want. Then, have a meal.< /Text>< response>

<text>I'm genuinely confused by how highly rated this is. Even for the fisherman's wharf or Pier 39, the food was pretty terrible. The clam chowder was alright if you could overcome the grittiness of what I assumed was poorly cleaned clams. I will say that the truffle fries were good, but slightly oily. I got the petrale dore, which was recommended by our waiter, and it was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this dish unless you like to pay $35 for oily, deep fried cardboard. The only redeeming thing on the plate was the tartar sauce, but that wasn't enough to cover the horrendous taste of the petrale. When I told the staff who took my staff that I didn't want leftovers a sit was just not good, nothing was done about it. Seriously, make the trek to Woodhouse, Waterbar, or anywhere on the grotto if you want good seafood.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is an old school vibe seafood place with excellent food. We had the several appetizers, the clams, crab cakes, and scallops. It was the beginning of crab season so we ordered a few roasted crabs as well. Everything was very fresh and I'd recommend visiting.

Tip: there's free valet parking if you drive all the way up to the restaurant.</text><Pics>None</Pics><UserId.>101110636712919975870<//UserId.><name>Randy Reyes< /name><Time>1542603396508< /Time>< response>

Very disappointed after waiting at bar for a table we were seated waitress took our drink order and then did not seem to want to wait on us and take our food order. No idea why we were treated this way. We were not drunk or out of line. We just paid for our drinks and left.</text>

Hidden away from the eyes of prying tourists, this is the best damn seafood in the area by a longshot.

Really top notch staff and atmosphere as well.<//Text>

<Review>we do not have the consent of the animals to eat them as good as lobster newburg tastes it is not right to eat them. there are vegan alternatives. i am an entrepreneur looking to make meat substitutes cheap and plentiful. we should get along with animals and teach them to communicate. we can grow lobster tails without killing their brains just to eat their tails<//Review>< pics>

A San Francisco icon. Still every bit as good as it was the last time I was there 35 years ago. We had the fried anchovie and calamari app, which was wonderful; the "Fritto Misto." The sauces that comes with it were special. The rest of the meal, and the service was perfection. Add the window seat, watching the seals playing in the water, and the charming, good-humored valet, and the experience became the cherry on top of our San Francisco sundae.</review>

We ate here today. Very disappointed. $200 for two people, not good. No alcohol ordered either. Clam chowder was okay but not special. Calamari was very chewy. Halibut for $43 was not hot and lacked flavor. $52 surf and turf was really disappointing. Steak was flavorless and crab meat portion was very small.< /text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Went there with the  whole family yesterday for my birthday. Excellent clam chowder and calamari fritte. I got violently sick on my way home. I was the only one to have the Canadian lobster tails and the only one with excruciating stomach pains and severe diarrhea within thirty minutes of leaving the restaurant with a 2.5 hr ride home due to heavy traffic in the city. Never been sick after a meal in my life. I can tolerate just about anything. I put the blame on the lobster tails as we all had the same clam chowder and appetizer.  I was the only one eating the lobster main course. Thankfully the doctor encouraged me to use miralax to  get rid of the tainted food. I was fine today after a tough night.most memorable birthday  of my life.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Tim, our waiter was on the spot at all times.  As soon as we thought about it, he was there with questions or suggestions.  Food was a 5 on scale of 5 but to us, it was all about the service from the live communications via text regarding our reservations to the warm welcome and prompt seating to Tim's superb attention without interruption and Jin Lin's water and setting service.  Final point, this was my second time visiting Scoma's...first was 20 years ago and the service and food have not wavered.   Maybe others in San Francisco that have higher ratings but for the atmosphere, service and taste, it's our favorite.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id>< Rating>

We came to celebrate my father's birthday and it didn't disappoint! The food was fresh and tasty and they even offered us aprons so we wouldn't stain our clothes with the delicious tomato broth of the cioppino. A bit expensive but a great seafood meal. They even brought us free dessert with a candle for my dad, when we didn't ask for it, great service, would definitely come back.< /review>

The food is decent, and it's pricing is what you would expect for the area.  Service is usually good to great. I reccomend the  Sol Dore.</text>< Pics>

The quality of the food is nothing like 20 years ago. They get 2 stars for our server, Jean Paul.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1572967490423, 'text': "Hi Cudjoe Key. Thank you for being a long-time customer and we appreciate your return visit. We are sorry to hear you feel our food is not as you recalled, but we believe we have only improved over the years. All our seafood now meets or exceeds the very strict sustainability standards set by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program. We also go out of our way to support the small, local fishing fleet right here in San Francisco, and they are delivering their catch to us almost daily right at our dock. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your server, and hopefully we'll have the chance to serve you again soon and help you choose items you will love.

Coming from a tourist's opinion I felt this place was overrated. It's good, but for the price point I expected more. There were much better seafood restaurants for the same price in SF.</Text>

The ambience inside is fun and cozy, we waited about 35 minutes to be sat but we hung out at the bar.  Great wine selection bar staff was very friendly. We had a pasta dish and fried shrimp and scallops. Everything was perfect. The pasta sauce was creamy and flavorful and the fried items were crispy but not soaked in oil. The service was fantastic. Loved this place.<//Text><UserId.>113960144991779162357</UserId.>< response>

The food is fair, small portions of fish which were over cooked. My husband said his fried seafood dish was not good. But in all fairness, we are from the northeast where the seafood is probably the best!
We've been to many $$ restaurants that were better than this $$$.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

This place is a classic... It hasn't changed much in the past 20 years and I bet it hasn't changed much since it opened... It's that good.  Make a reservation and take advantage of the valet parking. It's a place for seafood but this landlubber has always been satisfied with my meals here.< /review>

An elegant, yet with a pleasantly low-key atmosphere. A star choice if you are looking for good quality fresh sea-food with a twist. Charmingly located by San Francisco quay. Beyond the main dishes displayed a good selection of wines and nice deserts. A bit pricey but totally worth it.</review>

My friends had cioppino and loved it (split between two grown men and it was enough to share and then some!) And the salmon special was scrumptious! Definitely come here, ready for a memorable meal and a relaxed time.< /Text>< Pictures>

Superb seafood in waterfront location in San Francisco.  Excellent selection of well-cooked fish and seafood dishes, good wine selection, good atmosphere and friendly service.  Small amount of parking, but you'll probably want to get a cab here and taste their wine anyway!<//Text>

Wonderful food and service. The fried calamari are a great appetizer and the seared halibut is a wonderful choice. Highly recommend a visit. Some people say it's pricey, but I can't agree with this statement when I compare the price of food at other restaurants in the area. At least here you get what you pay for, and there are many years of service and reputation to rely on. Just a pleasure overall. Will return whenever I'm in town.</Text>

Great 'fresh' food, fantastic service, wonderful interiors, incredible view, and an authentic San Francisco Bay vibe! Doesn't get better than this. We loved our time here at the restaurant. I had the best Truffle Parmesan Fries, I have ever had in my life.</review>

I used to come here with my Dad when I was young. This was our go to spot. The food is still good, but the menu shrunk. You can still get items from the old menu if you ask for it, but you have to know the old menu. Service is very good and the views are very nice. Took my family here for the first time and had a very nice evening< /text>

Terrific from the time we arrived to the time we left.  The food was first class. Everyone in our party of four had a different meal and everyone really enjoyed it. Our waiter was gracious and entertaining. Sweet desserts were delicious and reasonably priced. The same menu is used for both lunch and dinner. We were there for lunch, and as a lunch item the entrees seemed a bit pricey. Each of the sea food items in my cioppino refresh season perfectly and tasted wonderful with the perfectly made broth.</Text>

My family and I usually ride BART to SF and walk around pier 39. Whenever, we do, we always eat at Scoma's. The food is so delicious here. I love that I can get my favorite seafood or shellfish and my husband can get his steak or chicken. Whatever you order at Scoma's will be fresh and very delicious. You will love the wait staff as I do. They are knowledgeable about all dishes, wine, drinks, and desserts.</Text>

I had high expectations on this place and they were largely met. We had the crab chowder to start which was pretty darn good. We followed up with the mixed fish grill. The fish was really good, very nicely grilled but the rice pasta could have used more flavour. The bbq sauce with the meal was a knockout. Service was unobtrusive and the meals came out quick.<//text>

Yes it's at fisherman's warf, and yes it was good quality, but still a high price for the food. Would eat there again, but probably wouldn't seek it out.

Delicious seafood and very big portion. One half of the restaurant is nicely decorated with new furniture and the other looks like it hasn't been touched for 70 years. All was good except one of the waiter would 'shush' the room once in a while as if he wants us to quiet down - super awkward for a restaurant to do that.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I visited in June of 2014. It took me a bit to get past the dated decor...

It was a little hard for a first timer to San Francisco to find, but turned out to be a hidden gem.

The food was absolutely out of this world. Dishes were spot on. Some of the best and freshest seafood I have tasted anywhere. Pasta was cooked perfectly (not over done like most places will serve).  Sauces tasted fresh.

This was the first restaurant I visited on my first visit to San Francisco, and it set the bar high for my expectations of the quality of seafood for the area. Some restaurants came close but none matched.

I would highly recommend this restaurant!< /text>< Pictures>

The food's pretty good.

Service is typical American which is fine. I'm guessing our guy has been working there since the dawn of time, he was old but effortless in his work.

Tip: avoid the mass produced beers and try the local stuff on tap. They're good!<//review>

I was taken to this restaurant for my anniversary.  Believe me when I say I tried to get out of it.  I didn't want to sit in a restaurant that smelled of fish or had creatures swimming awaiting their doom.  So I balked all the way to San Francisco.  When we arrived I thought it's a "Hole in the Wall" from the area we had driven into.  Then a valet came to park the car which I found odd because the restaurant appeared very small from the outside.
Boy, was I fooled.

Inside, you have a reservation counter and a cozy waiting place upstairs with vintage pictures on the wall.  There may be a 30 - 45 minute wait but you are not uncomfortable.  Drinks may be ordered from the waiting area and it's not drafty.  Upon going to the dining room, the doors were slid back and what a view!  Elegant dining room with a back wall view of the bay.  Service was on point and at the time Walter was my server.  He was the most charming man ever.  I had the Lobster Provolone Dinner and it was hands-down 5 star!  We had a Lovely evening.

Two weeks later in-laws from Germany arrived and after hearing about Scoma's took us out to this restaurant.  We all had a delightful time and this is now my favorite restaurant.  The crab salad is a must!  One salad fed 4 adults and we were almost too full for the meal.  Excellent!  10 Star!!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><review>This is my favorite place to dine in San Francisco. We always get the Cioppino, which only gets better each time we eat here. It is off the beaten path a little , built on it's own little Wharf shared with working fishing vessels so all the sights, sounds and smells are there. (A disclaimer...smells like the sea, not dead fish....inside it smells like wonderful cooking 😀). The wait staff is extrodinary. They have all been there for, I kid you not, for decades. I feel this place has not changed much since it opened....they know what is good and they keep doing great food.< /review>< pics>

This little gem of a seafood restaurant is hidden at the end of the pier. Valet parking at the end for customers.  Driving over a small bridge and around a blind corner, lol.  Well worth the search!  We ordered the   crab bisque 🦀 and lobster thermador which was more than enough for two. We did not want to wait for a table so we ate at the bar.  The bar area is a bit crowded, but again, the food is worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant.< /review>

Phenomenal Italian / seafood fusion restaurant with a lot of history. And waiters with a lot of history! You're not at a classic SF restaurant without the old gruff waiters who know their stuff but are pretty salty. We loved it and thought it was hilarious. I had their black cod with a beer flight. It was phenomenal. And decent local beer selection!< /review>

<Text>We had drinks in the upper bar, where the ambience is perfect. The mixologists are super, interacting and explaining things to patrons. The cucumber in my G&T was a work of art, they obviously take their craft seriously. Jean-Marc served us with infectious enthusiasm.

I cannot think of a better way to while away a couple of hours before dinner.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Old school style restaurant with seafood. The wait staff was a bit quirky and the space was cramped. The seafood was fresh and good. It is a bit tucked away and I was told the view is better for lunch.</text>

Scomas location on the edge of the world  Famous fisherman's wharf in San Francisco is truly a unique & incredible experience by itself. What makes this restaurant one of the top must see places is its amazingly delicious & fresh from the sea offerings on its traditional menu.

Over the years, The restaurant has kept its higher than average standards of bringing ecceptional service to those are fortunate enough to experience all that is Scoma's.< /text>

Has a great view of the city and the habor with the Golden Gate bridge in the back ground. Be careful before deciding to eat here menu wise. The menu on the sidewalk is for ground level dinning. There was no menu present for upstairs with views you have to ask at the sidwalk level to see it.< /Text>

Great food in a bit of a hidden away location. Ate for lunch as a party of 8, no pre-booking.

Very friendly and helpful staff, food was very good and portions huge (for a Brit)!  Maybe consider sharing.

Pricing wise you will find much cheaper restaurants just round the corner, but I can't imagine they are of the same calibre.</Text>

I was pleased two of us shared the calamari starter otherwise I would have have been full before the seafood saute arrived. This was outstanding, cooked to perfection. Quality wine was reasonably priced for a restaurant. Service was with a smile and provided just the right of information.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Scoma’s restaurant is a must do for any foodie traveling through San Fransisco. Located in Fisherman’s Wharf this homy restaurant is within a hub of sight seeing to do’s. The food is tasty and fresh and they have a full bar that offers craft cocktails. The ambiance is comfortable and somewhat upscale without being pretentious. Waitstaff is experienced and gracious. There is also a valet option as parking can be a challenge on the wharf. Come down and give this local favorite a try.</Text>

Top notch!  We make plans to dine at Scomas every time we are in San Francisco. We are never disappointed in the meals and service. This time around my husband had the Chopino and he loved it. I had the Fish & Chips lunch special which was great portions of tender fish in crispy beer batter. Soo Good! Their clam chowder is very delicious also, we shared a cup just because we have to have chowder with sour dough when we come to the wharf & this one hits the mark. I suggest you walk past all those noisy eateries along the main street to this legendary restaurant, follow the signs to Scomas.< /review>

<Review>Great food in a bit of a hidden away location. Ate for lunch as a party of 8, no pre-booking.

Very friendly and helpful staff, food was very good and portions huge (for a Brit)!  Maybe consider sharing.

Pricing wise you will find much cheaper restaurants just round the corner, but I can't imagine they are of the same calibre.</Review><rate>4<//rate>< Resp>

<text>I've never eaten at fisherman's wharf but on my last trip I couldn't avoid it. Scoma's was probably there before fisherman's wharf turned into the tourist trap it is today. The age is reflected in the interior, which makes for a rather charming/cozy atmosphere. The waiters were friendly and helpful. Food is rather pricey but OK.<//text>< name>

<review>Classic white tablecloth Californian seafood restaurant, with professional table service, fresh fish and a good enough bar. The plancha seared calamari were really good and I also had the crab Thermidor and shared crab plate and both were fine. People here are a mixture of tourists and adult old time Californians and the menu is the traditional old time french inspired seafood cuisine. It's a five stars if you are really into that, otherwise it's a little bit expensive for what they offer.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1548771412618, 'text': "Hi Pedro.

Quick summary...amazing food, incredible location, generous portions, great staff.

Sometimes you have a great experience at a restaurant but occasionally you have an unforgettable experience. My father and I had one of those unforgettable experiences at our last visit to Scoma's. Kevin, our waiter and Matthew the manager were simply incredible to us and couldn't have been more gracious, kind and generous.

PS: get the Cioppino...you won't be disappointed.< /text>

<review>Brought my wife, her mother and father, and my son and his wife down to spend two days in San Francisco before we headed down to Carmel. We are all big seafood eaters and picked out Scoma's because of it's high rating. We all had mussels except for one person in our group, and all but the one became violently ill that night. Easily the worst food sickness we have ever had. Please be avised, I would never order mussels or shellfish again from.this restaurant. Although we at this point would never go back to Scoma's.</review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1554389977836, 'text': "Brant, we're sorry to hear you weren't feeling well. Please know that food sickness can take anywhere from several hours to several days for the symptoms to manifest themselves. We serve many dozens of orders of of mussels every night and had no other such reports but with seafood, it is always a possibility. Please reach out to us if you can with more details about your order and the timing of your symptoms. Food safety is always our number one priority at Scoma's and we always want to know as much as possible about any possible issue. Thank you and we hope you were feeling better soon."}< /Response>

< Review>
Nothing was particularly wrong, but nothing was spectacular either. We tried Scoma's based on several recommendations by friends. Our waitress was great, very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We order drinks to start while deciding what to eat, the drinks were delivered quickly, they're fine...a little light on the alcohol based on how much they're charging and not made as well as other places. We order an appetizer to split and order our entrees at the same time. Our appetizer never comes... It ends up being delivered with our entrees. Not what we wanted with an appetizer but ok. I order the cioppino, and it was tasty. He orders the steak (doesn't like seafood), and it's just ok... The steak was cooked well enough but not great, the parmesan polenta was not very good (I've made better at home) and the mushrooms were just ok (he didn't like the texture of how they were cooked). We decide on dessert, our waitress expounds on how great their pastry chef is.... It's a lie, the desserts were no better than grocery store bought desserts. Overall a disappointment based on recommendations and reviews, and their own reporting.<//Review>

We had been looking forward to this dinner for a long time. It was disappointing. Sat us in a small room that was over lit. Way to bright. Food was okay okay at best. I had the mixed grill and it was small with a lot of filler vegetables.  The fish itself was tasty but very small pieces. For the price of 190 for two of us I wouldn't recommend  it. Go somewhere else.<//text>

My wife and I LOVE this place. This is the focal point of any visit to San Francisco. If you enjoy fresh off the boat seafood, in a very well done 1960s Italian bar and restaurant atmosphere, then this place should be at the top of your list. Make reservations.<//review>

<review>I've been going to Scomas since I was 6 years old. Now I'm 58 years old.  I always have had a great time and great food.  Not this day last Saturday.  We were seated in lousy seats, we wanted hot coffee and got warm coffee we asked for it to be microwaved and the waiter said no we then asked him to take the coffee away then he came back with hot coffee.  Our order was taken very poorly attitude waiter, we ordered ciopino and we had this dish over the past 20 years and it tasted like tomatoe soup. The waiter asked how the meal was and we asked if the cook was new and we were told he'd been there a couple years. The waiter asked why are we asking and we explained the ciopino was just tomato soup with sea food.  Waiter said he would let the chef know. We are ok with that. Our meal was 160.00 we left a 40.00 tip. The waiter came outside and siad  thank you and we were happy about that. During our meal we heard a loud french accent waiter yelling at a dark beared waiter making comments to him that he would kill him, and tear him apart basic threats and that was disappointing.  So i am sad to say Scomas has lost its pasaz and quality and ambiance after my 50 years of going there. I felt i was treated lack luster because of my attire but rest assured we are well off. Oh one last thing as we were leaving a guy with a jaguars had lost his keys from the valet so sad we like the valet. So something is wrong at Scomas!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Retains the old SF vibe while having classic dishes that will please just about anyone. Even people who are not seafood fans should be able to find something great.</text>

Menu in the $20-$40 meal range. The clam chowder soup and clam chowder bisque are both delicious at about $12. The bisque is extremely crabby and smooth while the chowder is a bit more mellow and chunky.< /text>

We had a pleasant evening and the place has old school charm but the food wasn’t amazing which was slightly disappointing given the price. If you are spending over $200 for your meal you really want to walk out saying “that was fabulous”....we didn’t< /Review>

Don't expect that, as everything will come with some sort of sauce that will hide seafood natural taste. If you're used to eat seafood with sauce, go for it. Locals seemed to like it a lot.< /Review>< Pics>

I was disappointed in the food.  The waiter was friendly and great.  It was good for children,  but the food was old fashioned and just not up to what i had hoped with such a high rating.   I know many people are happy with the food, but you have to know who is rating it.  I'm a bit of a foodie.</Text>

Great dinner spot.   Off the beaten path but worth going out of your way.  Parking is tight so walk or uber.  Staff was excellent and very attentive.  Drinks and food were both excellent.  Old school "rat pack" feel, lounge areas and dinner seating allow for a couples or friends night out.  Portions were good size and reasonably priced.  Highly recommend the mixed seafood grill and butternut squash soup.<//text>

We have a tradition of eating lunch at Scoma's when we fly in to San Fran from the east coast.  It's our first stop.  It's always been great but this past Friday night (dinner for the first time), it was a major disappointment.  Not one of the five of us enjoyed our meal.  Dry, tasteless fish and blah-broth, lazy man's cioppino. Small portions of bland, dry fish for $40.00!  I don't think so.

The staff is great and the atmosphere is cozy and fun.  Major help needed in the kitchen.  There are too many places to eat in San Fran that are excellent and unfortunately, there is little excitement or interest in eating at Scoma's again.< /Review>

This place is incredible .
I don't really like seafood but I loved every single thing I ate (& I even ate a tentacle!). My other half loved seafood and loved it too.The food is fantastic and there is a lovely atmosphere.
There's a classy 60s feel inside (the waiters are in white jackets and  and just so lovely and knowledgeable). Scoma have their own boat and you can literally watch the fish come off the boat, into their processing plant and into the restaurant. You can't get fresher.
Don't let the lack of outdoor seating put you off. We arrived at sunset on a lovely night & wanted to sit outside ...... But actually a seat in the lounge by the window was incredible. We watched a lovely sunset and kept warm.< /Review>

We arrived late because or lyft driver was very slow but they still honored our waitlist spot.  We had a very professional and attentive waiter but not extremely personable.  I ordered the 3 fish grill (cod, salmon and halibut) and a cup of clam chowder. I loved the halibut and the salmon was above average the cold tasted a teeny bit underdone but that may have been the texture since it is a flaky fish.  She ordered calamari app, ceasar salad and a cup of clam chowder. She enjoyed everything as well but we both agreed the clam chowder was the belle of the ball.

It was a pricey meal at nearly a hundred dollars for our meals but it was a prime location and beautiful post sunset view.

While I wouldn't insist on a revisit, I have no regrets.  It was a lovely meal and a great experience.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Amazing dinner!  Service was excellent. Our server, Sal, made us feel so special. My daughter wanted a pasta dish with crab, but the menu did not offer one. Sal said they could make it for her. He recommended the white wine, mushroom and garlic sauce and the dish was perfect!  The cracked chilled crab was juicy and sweet!
I will recommend SCOMA'S to all my friends that plan to visit SAN FRANCISCO!</text>

Stellar meal. Attentive service. Great old school cocktails (boozy, plentiful, cold) - very fresh seafood, excellent presentation, well put together traditional menu ( oysters Rockefeller? Hell yes!) - Dungeness crab pot overflowing with fresh meat ; oyster platter was exquisite. Desserts a must.</text>

Amazing food, hidden gem. Excellent waitstaff recommendations, patient with many questions and very attentive to food allergies.

Highly recommend!

Based on location and lack of signs pointing you there, very much seemed like a “locals secret”!<//Review>

This is a hidden treasure just a little off the beaten path.  Calamari was the best I have ever tasted - paired with excellent sauces. Shrimp and scallops dish was a little taste of heaven. Highly recommend!!</Text>

We love Scoma's. It's great old school service and awesome food. There were at least 20 people milling around inside and out hoping to get a table, and it looked sketchy for our reservation, but we were seated at our table immediately. Yes, they knew how to both take and keep a reservation. We'll be back.< /Review>

I love this restaurant! Although it is expensive, it is worth it. The staff are always great and Ive never had a bad meal here. I highly recommend the swordfish or rockcod however they cook them. I can always count on a great meal here.</Review>

We had a pleasant evening and the place has old school charm but the food wasn’t amazing which was slightly disappointing given the price. If you are spending over $200 for your meal you really want to walk out saying “that was fabulous”....we didn’t<//Text>

The green salad that came with it was tasty and I liked the kind off greens they used not your average ice Berg. It came with French fries with the skin. We were there for lunch so they offered lunch specials which I really at appreciated. They weren't skimpy in their servings either. Although the I've tea was a bit expensive $3 and it came in a small glass. It's the cheapest easiest drink to make. I was a bit irritated but then I remembered we had about 4 baskets of their yummy sourdough bread so I calmed down 😁  overall it was a nice dining experience for me. The service was great.< /Text>< UserId.>

< Review>
Recommended by a cab driver, said they had the best clam chowder in San Francisco.... clam chowder is alright. Food is over priced. Our waiter was a chubby guy sounded just like Louie Anderson. Was very nice and friendly to everyone else, but when it came to be and my husband he never made conversation. Never going there again.< /Review>

<review>The website claims the restaurant is „vegetarian friendly“. Since we couldn’t find anything vegetarian on their menu, we called to ask. They told us they can make a salad and pasta. When we asked if that was it (considering they claim to be so friendly towards vegetarians), they hung up on us. Great customer service!< /review><user>116665168373163638794<//user>< GmapID>

I think Scoma's has gone down some.  The portions are not as large and the go-withs don't match the main dish.  I  had the mixed grill with a strange barley and carrot salad ... I dunno.   It didn't chime with me.   The setting can't be beat, though, and the Bloody Mary's are top notch.</Text>

Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.
After being repeatedly and shamelessly lied to about the availability of our table, it was impossible to enjoy anything these lying pieces of crud could serve. "Immediately" and "we're preparing your table right now"  mean at least a 30 minute wait at this nightmare of mismanagement and lies in my experience tonight.
Don't wait for a table here, don't eat here. These diots don't deserve a penny on your money.<//Review>

Romantic location in exclusive Sausalito with views of San Francisco and Tiburon. Seafood is fresh and oysters on the half shell get comfortable on a bed of ice. Dining here is intimate and conversations inspire grins and sharing of secret tales in three to four languages. Excellent location, cuisine and sometimes even the company.</Review>

After a long day of touristy stuff with two kids we happened in on this local's recommended restaurant.  We were tired and it was about a 45 min wait, but we sat at the bar and the nicest bartender made us feel right at home.  Seafood and kids meals were excellent.  Garlic crab and seafood salad were top notch and my daughter especially liked the prawns.  I would highly recommend this for anyone in or around the area.<//review>

One of the best seafood restaurants in the city. Free valet parking. There is usually a wait on the weekends so a reservation is helpful. Try the shellfish saute. It's not on the menu but it's incredible!< /review>

There were at least 20 people milling around inside and out hoping to get a table, and it looked sketchy for our reservation, but we were seated at our table immediately. Yes, they knew how to both take and keep a reservation. We'll be back.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The clam chowder is great, it's the first place I ever had fried calamari (with marinara, pls) but the cioppino is my absolute favorite.  I couldn't visit SF without visiting Scoma's.</Text>< Pictures>

I didn't mind the 90 minute wait, because of the tremendous food. The sauce used to be garlicky and flavorful. This one tasted like fish and shellfish boiled in tomato soup, so pretty bland.

Now this is a place worth visiting again. Vintage sanfran pier extremely fresh seafood. Tasty, well presented and reasonable quantity. Had calimari, fried scallops with bacon and crabcakes. Main meal was halibut and it just melted in your mouth. Wonderful flavors.Service was stellar. Even after we asked for our 4th helping of sourdough bread.</text>

<Text>There were 2 sides to our experience.  First we went at 2:30pm and it was very busy, unfortunately they couldn't handle it.  We had a very efficient guy filling up our drinks and bringing us bread but that wasn't the waiter, the waiter took a long, long time to take our orders, even though we had told the drink-server guy we were ready ages before.  He also made an excuse rather than just apologizing.  Then my wife was brought her chowder way before my scampi starter, this is just amateur.  Then our mains were brought before our starters had been taken away, not such a bad thing but it's a clear indication of a badly run floor and pass.  The food was tasty but also expensive.  The table next to us had complained that one of their dishes tasted very strange although the chef did come over and apologize.  Overall it was great food with very badly organized service.  Don't go when it's busy and you'll probably have a good time.<//Text>< Pics>

Hidden behind Fisherman's Wharf with a view of the water this place is worth the few extra steps and sometimes short wait.  Once you are seated you are greeted by the most friendly staff and walked through the delicious daily specials(many of them right off the boat).  They have a nice wine menu and you are given a nice basket of bread to munch on while your food is being prepared.

A little bit pricey, but well worth it compared to the other tourists traps around the Wharf this place is worth the money.  The Cioppino is to die for and comes in a huge portion, The fresh swordfish is also a favorite menu item.< /Text>

The best possible seafood in San Francisco. Scomas is a landmark in Fisherman's wharf. They have the freshest seafood, right off the boat. Beautiful views day or night. The bay is lapping right up to the parking lot - and yes, they have free parking, just remember to tip the hard working valets. They can have long waits to be seated, you're welcome to call ahead and ask what the wait time is. The long waits to be seated are because they are the best seafood restaurant ever. People come from all over the world to eat at Scoma's.
Try it.  You won't be disappointed.<//review>

Although the clam chowder wasn't terrible, it isn't worth the hype and was very starchy. Maybe living in Rhode Island I've become a snob. I was really disappointed in the Dungeness crab cakes. Shredded meat and lots of filler, when I had been expecting some decent limp crab cake. Service was terrible. Very slow. 10 minutes before being offered even water. I opted not to stay for a main course.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Your going to have a hard time finding fresher seafood than this place, if you were paying attention you walked by the fishing boats on your way to the restaurant. Excellent crab cakes, clam chowder and the scallops are my personal favorites.</text>

<review>The grilled fish and prawns were fresh, not old or frozen. Served with barley, carrot, zuchinni, and squash. It was a terrific combination and the meal was top shelf. The service was also very good. Good value for money.< /review>< pictures>

Truly a special place, enjoyed a wonderful dinner with my daughter for her birthday, but can see that it would be the same for anyone enjoying a meal at anytime. Fresh fish and clam chowder, add a wonderful dessert and you have an occasion to remember.<//Review>

My wife and I were in San Francisco above the Fisherman's Wharf area from July 1 - 5, 2002, shortly after our marriage, and a nearby shopkeeper (would that I could remember his name or of his store!) recommended Scoma's as a great place to eat. He was right. Fantastic food and service. My one disappointment was trying Dungeness Crab but aside from that, nothing whatsoever to complain about. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the fine food and drink Scoma's has to offer. P.S. You do have Alaskan King Crab legs don't you?  ;)</review></record>

Disappointed from the high ratings it received. Ordered the trio sampler first.  The calamari was mostly tenttactes and not fried adequately.  The scallops and crab cakes on it were decent.

My seafood in marinera sauce was decent but the bartender recommend a crab cream cheese casserole dish which was subpar.

Overall the food here is decent but definitely not superb like the ratings would lead you to believe.  The Fog House was much better with nice ambiance and actually cheaper!<//review>

<response>{'time': 1554392784512, 'text': "Thank you for your visit, and feedback, James. Our Calamari is one of our most popular dishes exactly for the reason you listed--it is lightly fried, mostly tentacles and not the simple rings most places serve. But we understand that might not be for everyone. Hopefully we'll see you back some day and you will try some other items you do love. Please let us know!"}<//response><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmapID></record>

<text>The food and service are not as great as their location across the bay (Sausalito), but I enjoyed all of the dishes I ordered nonetheless.

If you're expecting the same experience as the Sausalito location, you will be a bit disappointed.  However, if you're craving any of their signature dishes and don't feel like crossing the bay, then it's conveniently located adjacent to Fisherman's Wharf.</text>< Pics>

Seem like you get transfered back in time as the waiters have very traditional uniforms and it seems nothing got changed on the interior since 60 years. Better reserve a table as otherwise you need to wait. The food is delicious but pricy which is probably related to the proximity to Fisherman's Wharf. Definitely worth a visit as also there is a wide variety of dishes and not everything is seafood. A cool place...< /Review>

Oh my God this place is amazing! Seriously the best seafood you can get on the wharf! Do yourself a favor leave Pier 39 walk down to the Fisherman's Wharf and find this place and you will not be upset! Like seriously this place is crazy out-of-control bomb! I ended up going here twice on my recent weekend trip the SF. And I might head there this weekend also. The poor man's Cioppino is the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, and I crave it every day that I don't get some.< /text>

Long wait,  slow service,  expect 2.5 hours total.  Food is good but not amazing.  Lobster and steak are flavorless.  So are the veggies.  Its by the water so pretty nice view,  but not all its hyped to be.  Wouldn't come again.< /review>

I can't put my finger on it because the food was delicious ..and yes it was pricy...service was good as well.. possibly it was eating dinner watching the multitude of homeless dig though the dock trash for food right outside the window. No reflection on this establishment or it's team...state of our society<//Review>

Excellent seafood place right on Fisherman's wharf.  Good service, beer, and better food. Not much of a view outside of the docks off of the building due to other larger structures.<//text>

Stupid waiter ignored us, when we trying to order.
If you don’t want to servers us just ask someone else to do so.
I can definitely seen the difference between you sever other table and us,seen you sick smile. The $6 dollars only for cleaning fee, not for your service.
Anyway the food was just okey, don’t worthy. Don’t wasted your time and money. Nothing special!</review>

We went only one night to Scoma's but it's worth every cent. The seafood was excellent. Also the service and the furnishings and equipment are very good. We really loved the location as the restaurant is located on an old pier.< /Text>

Overpriced, terrible service and awful food.  For these prices we should have had a leisurely dinner but that was not the case.  We had cocktails, appetizers & meal & we're done in less than 40 minutes.  We ordered the clams & they were just plan weird (definitely not the right texture).  The beet salad was good but the presentation was really unappetizing.  The fish entrees we had were "ok" but at $34 for 6oz. of salmon, it should have been a lot better.  Basically I will never recommend this place - NEVER!< /Review>

<Review>I went here twice in one week - if you're in the wharf area,  this is a must try.  I like to sit at the bar,  and both times the service was excellent.  Wish I had gotten the Dungeness crab - it looked phenomenal.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>We went because of all the good reviews, the views, and the history the restaurant had. But it was outrageously overpriced, the service was awful, and the food was okay but nothing spectacular and not even worth half of what we paid. The most disappointing place we ate in all of San Francisco.< /Text><rating>2</rating><pictures>None</pictures>< user_id>

It's a classic spot with fresh crab for the crab cakes and delicious oysters.  The bread that comes to the table is also a wonderful start.< /Text>

Touristy, classic seafood on Fisherman's Wharf, it's been there for decades literally.  Very traditional style decor and food, the best thing to get is the crab when in season only. They own their own boat, so the fish is as fresh as it gets.<//text>

Oh my! What a find!   We were near Fisherman's Warf looking for a good bite to eat and Yelp suggested this place.   When we walked in I was a little worried that we were underdressed because the wait staff was bow ties and sharp as could be.  But I figured, "meh, my money's green."
Our waiter was very kind and kept our kids supplied with a delicious crusty bread. We barely scratched the menu but the fish and chips and clam chowder were absolutely excellent.  I for one am pretty hard to please with those two items and Scoma's nailed them.
Overall our lunch in SanFran was one of the best experiences of the trip.<//Review>

This was the best meal ever! Every single item we ordered (6 total) Fresh, off the roof tasty, and the service was excellent. Anything above $100 for my family of four is shameful, and out of our budget. But... I will go back with my eyes closed, pretending, ignoring world hunger. Thank you Scoma's!</Review>

<Text>This is definitely one of those places that you have to go to in San Francisco. I have been told to go here by so many people and after sitting down and trying it I completely understand why so many people are in love with this place. As a tourist is one of those places you just have to try at least once.</Text><userid>117897332138539801307< /userid><Pics>None</Pics><name>Jason R<//name>< Rating>

First time that I have been to this restaurant. If you enjoy and appreciate New York style type of waiters, then this is the place for you. The meal that I ordered was a house speciality and it excited the pallet. I have learned to eat slowly and enjoy the flavors and presentation. The individual that was in charged of filling the water glass was excellent and attentive. I tried the chowder house speciality found that it was a smaller portion, as compared to Fog Harbor. I would definitely return to try other items.</Text>

<text>Amazing seafood, even better people that work here what more could you ask for? Oh maybe some old celebrity photos on the wall? Yeah this place has that too. If you are eating here and have room get the Clam Chowder, Cioppino, or the Grilled Salmon with Lobster Ravioli. Every time I have eaten here it was great and I am going to be making another reservation to come here in the next week or two.</text>< Pictures>

From first glance of the neighborhood, I wasn't sure about this place. My gut said this is going to be cheesy, but I had seen really good reviews online.

It blew me away. Really good classic dishes, with authentic flavor. The crab cakes had just enough crab and the sauce was not tooo rich. Get the fried artichoke hearts, they were light but still crispy!

This is great for a date, anyone who wants to get a waterfront view, and a cozy place.< /text>

The service was very slow, the waitress only took half our drink orders before leaving the table, the fish didn't seem fresh, and all our entrees were very oily and almost identical, even when they looked different on the menu. Their lobster bisque was quite nice though.<//Text>

Service was fine, but not equipped to solve the food questions.

I had the Classic Crab Louie Salad (~$40). The crab was tasteless. I ate about 1/3 and gave up. Server assured me it was not frozen, but the lack of taste suggested to me it probably canned. Server suggested they may have 'washed' the crab reducing the flavor?

My friend had the Poor Man's Cioppino (~$40), which was an apt description. Lots of seafood in a thick sauce that could have been V8 juice. The brussel sprouts($9) were very good, you can't really go wrong when you add bacon to anything. Tasty bread and butter. Definitely a tourist trap, would not recommend.

Total bill a bottle of sparkling water ~$107, no alcohol. Yes, we could have sent it all back and walked out, some days you just don't have the energy for that.

Tonight we have reservations at 'Dirty Habit' and much higher expectations.< /Text>

Amazing food and impeccable service! I had the swordfish picatta and a salad w/ iced tea that magically never got empty. Half the time I didn't even notice the servers as they topped off our drinks or cleared items from the table. Overall, we had a great experience!</Review>

I live in the Bay Area but only recently visited Scoma's for the first time.  Unfortunately, it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  The food was ok but was pretty bland, and the menu seemed severely lacking in creativity.  The fact that they give you free parking is great, but I found the prices pretty high for the quality of the meal.  Perhaps worth trying once, but I'm not sure I'll go back.< /Text>

I had the seafood grill, and it was perfectly prepared. The service is great as well as the view. It's also a little hidden so tourists are likely to miss it.</Text>

<review>Worst seafood I've ever had! Anyone that appreciates and respects the protein should avoid this place. Their Cioppino being their signature dish deserved the name Lazy! It could have been a tinned chunky tomato soup. So very disappointing!
Dated... overpriced... poorly cooked... presentation was terrible... I have left feeling hungry and robbed!< /review><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//Gmap_id>< rate>

One of just a few places along the wharf we enjoy. Their mussels are our favs though they were not so good last time we visited. The wait for a table is usually very long so call ahead.</review>

The best place for fish in San francisco, period!  Try the Pacific Sole. Guaranteed to please. Some of the best crabcakes I've ever eaten. Excellent wine selection. Friendly staff.  Reservations suggested. I never miss a chance to eat at Scomas when I visit SF!< /Text>

Love this place! Very fresh seafood, very tasty. Love the mafioso appeal. The walls filled with countless autographed celebrity photos offer amusing eye appetizers while awaiting our entrees. Best clam chowder I've ever had in The City. It's a little hidden but in a good way, likely keeping out wandering tourists or weekend hippies from chancing upon it, making it next to impossible to get a window table on a walk-in. Of all of the many eateries around San Francisco's great Wharf, Scoma's is the the only one I personally consider worthy of historical significance. Yes, Boudins began here and may still be the more popular restaurant even today, however in my opinion Boudins has grown into the Budweiser of bread. Scoma's has something no other Embarcadero restaurant has, a pulse, an identity, character, and bay city charm.  Stepping into Scoma's feels like stepping out of the city. A peaceful, quiet, sense will greet you as you enter as if time itself slows. Forwarding through time, neighboring eateries will likely fade away while Scoma's remains, gaining fame, iconic status, and historical importance. What Randy's Donuts is to LA, or what Katz Delicatessen is to Manhattan, so should Scoma's be to SF. From the cresting waves of the mighty Pacific Ocean, along California's golden coastline, a small port town filling with migrant ruffians and Forty-Niners quickly grew outward and upward. It grew across steep terrain, eventually gaining root spanning the entire Southern Peninsula. Where Giant Pacific Redwood forests once grew, now grows a mighty metropolis. A civilization so grand that Westerners know simply as, "The City," and it was here, hidden down a narrow alleyway, treaded upon by those who've come to know of it. There, built directly onto the wooden planks of a dock, nearest the point where city becomes sea, that is where you'll find it...  Scoma's. To all you soon to be first timers, you're welcome.<//text>

It's a seafood restaurant so don't go there for the pasta. The alfredo wasn't very interesting and I don't eat seafood so there wasn't much else to try. The chocolate brownie with ice cream was delicious though. It's a big place with a lot of seats but they still had a waiting list on the weekend.<//Review>

<text>Food was excellent, and it had a nice ambiance. Most of the staff was wonderful, however our waitress was terrible. Unfriendly, would not get us drink refills, etc. Also, location is down a one lane alley, so can be tricky to get in and out. Worth the adventure though!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user>

<text>At first the price scares most people, but that shouldn't stop anyone. After eating at many different seafood restaurants up and down the coast, Scoma's remains my favorite . I have never had poor service and the food is always excellent. It remains one of the few place that will make sure your visit is perfect and that is why I try to eat there whenever I visit San Francisco.<//text>< Pictures>

Started with a perfect Bloody Mary while waiting 45 minutes for a table.  Never has a wait been so worth it!

We had a bowl of clam chowder.  Fresh clams and organic ingredients. It was far and away the best I have had!

The entre was Pasta Diplomatica which is sort of an Alfredo white sauce.  Fresh ground pepper and fresh grated cheese added to the mix. It was a huge portion of one of the best entre's I have ever had!  Simply delicious!

The wait staff, of which there are plenty, are always there before you need them.  Always filling glasses or taking care of things, but never intruding into the meal.

It was the best meal I have had in a very long time!  Only shame was we had no room for desert.  And the desert menu was sooo tempting.

I will never come to San Francisco and miss Scoma's restaurant!</review>

<review>I have loved this place since my father took me there as a child and young adult. I was killing time and thinking of calamari as I saw the Scoma sign. It was so tender and the spinach salad was awesome.

<Name>Angie Bernardo<//Name><review>We came to Scomas for lunch because of the great reviews and the free valet parking. Walked in right when they opened at 1130am and got a seat right by the window as requested. Excellent service by older gentlemen that took care of us, had the Cod on the lunch prefix menu along with four shellfish combo which was delicious , I will be back.<//review><date>1364077830753<//date>< user_id>

<Text>The food was great and the waiter was amazing. He helped me choose softer foods (a week past wisdom tooth removal) and gave us a huge "sample" of a salted caramel gelato when we couldn't decide between a few desserts. I wouldn't way service is slow as others complained, I think the atmosphere is meant to be that way.< /Text>< Pictures>

If you think Olive Garden is fancy, then you're in for a treat.
Every thing about Scoma's is dated and out of style but screams a desperate attempt at the appearance of class. Wood paneling, conference room seating and walls of photographs of celebrities no one under 40 can name.
The food was fresh and edible, but the dishes are the very definition of boring and poorly executed by what I assume are novice chefs.
The waitstaff are, from my experience, old, slow, dressed in the typical steak house white jacket/black pants and walk with a sad, hunched, shuffling gait.
Scoma's antiquity would be endearing, if the food were not so painfully boring.< /Review>

<Review>The best place for fish in San francisco, period!  Try the Pacific Sole. Guaranteed to please. Some of the best crabcakes I've ever eaten. Excellent wine selection. Friendly staff.  Reservations suggested. I never miss a chance to eat at Scomas when I visit SF!< /Review>< Pics>

Nice service! The oysters and fried calamari are very good. But the cod is a bit overcooked, and the linguini (with prawns) doesn't have too much flavor. With that price, I would go Cliff house instead..< /Text>

My husband & I just by chance found out about this "fabulous" place to eat. O'my is it ever wonderful, the food is spot on and the service is great. Seating can be a little tight, but since we had no reservations we couldn't complain. We had the "clams & pasta" clams braised in butter, olive oil, garlic & white wine, the roasted beet salad, and Denver Sole lightly sauteed. White wine and some yummy hot bread. Each course was served separately...we rolled out because the portions were ample enough to share. AND WE WILL RETURN!!!< /review>

We went there on 19 th sept seated and
All very frIedly but there seemed to be friction
When we inquired about the size of the meals
As the ladies were not big eaters it all went downhill from here the waiter became pushy
And condescending sensing we were tourists
Australian when we asked another  question
He grunted “tourist” gave us the bill and walked
Off. Then expect a tip
I feel some education in customer service
Would  be money well spent but rest assured  it
Won’t be ours
The food was good the service  and attitude of the staff was sadly lacking
We won’t be recommending this place purely
Because of the way we were treated .
Walk a couple of 100 meters past the entrance plenty of places 10 times cheaper and better food and friendly Cheerful welcoming staff

The hostess seated us near the service area at the end of the restaurant even though there were so many tables available at the elevated level of the restaurant. Only caucasians were led to the large elevated room while asians were put together in another smaller closed off area. Disappointed to see such blatant racism even today in a city which is so cosmopolitan.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I live in the Bay Area but only recently visited Scoma's for the first time.  Unfortunately, it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  The food was ok but was pretty bland, and the menu seemed severely lacking in creativity.  The fact that they give you free parking is great, but I found the prices pretty high for the quality of the meal.  Perhaps worth trying once, but I'm not sure I'll go back.<//Review><time>1281729393440< /time>< Resp>

Definitely the best clam chowder I had. They had large clam pieces. The crab cocktail could've used less sauce. But I'm looking forward to go back and try their othet food.<//review>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Scoma atmosphere is dated, with 1990's seafood resteraunt feel.  The resteraunt is clean and we'll maintained.  Food offerings are good and prepared well. I had the salmon.  Expect a wait unless you sit at the bar which is typically full also.  Customer service was neutral, maybe because of workload, but I didn't find the service pleasant.<//review>< Date>

This a great place to go for a late Dinner, or just cocktails. It can be a bit crowded at times, but the views of the Bay and the Table service are worth it.< /review>

The area we were sitted in was perfect for our party. The halibut was a little over cooked so it was dry on the inside, it could use a sauce on top, the oysters alla Scoma's weren't as good as they used to be. Our waiters were the best thank you Sal and his look a like friend.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>We went there on 19 th sept seated and
All very frIedly but there seemed to be friction
When we inquired about the size of the meals
As the ladies were not big eaters it all went downhill from here the waiter became pushy
And condescending sensing we were tourists
Australian when we asked another  question
He grunted “tourist” gave us the bill and walked
Off. Then expect a tip
I feel some education in customer service
Would  be money well spent but rest assured  it
Won’t be ours
The food was good the service  and attitude of the staff was sadly lacking
We won’t be recommending this place purely
Because of the way we were treated .
Walk a couple of 100 meters past the entrance plenty of places 10 times cheaper and better food and friendly Cheerful welcoming staff

<review>Love scomas restaurant. The food is consistently delicious and fresh. The service is wonderful. Views are beautiful and I have not had a menu item that I ever was disappointed with. Stronglyr ecommend this Restaurant over the other wharf restaurants as Scomas food is much superior in quality, taste and with presentation as well. Worth the money spent.< /review>< pics>

Overpriced and mediochre.   We did get excellent service, but $9 draft beers, and a $40 entree that was three tiny pieces of grilled fish and 2 prawns on a bed of orzo and diced veggies?   Gimmee a break.< /Review>

Prawns were fried and greasy, veggies and orzo that came with it were meh, crab bisque barely had any crab in it, market crab was good. All overpriced for the quality. Outdated atmosphere. I was really disappointed.</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I was very excited to try this place but I must say it was all hype.  The salmon was grossly over cooked to well-done (dry).  The service was horrible.  My waiter was an elderly man who had trouble hearing but that wasn't a problem.  The problem was that he visited our table once during the entire meal which was only to bring the check.  Catching him while passing by was a task and it was as though we were bothering him.  This a disappointing experience overall but on a positive note my wife enjoyed the roasted whole crab.  Won't be back for sure.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Popped in right before they were closing to grab a couple glasses of wine and some calamari. Best part of the evening is the fact we were driven here in a brand new Bentley flying spur, which was awesome, so it began with us leaving AT&T park after watching USC crush CAL (Fight On), so we proceeded to try and catch a cab, but with no luck we walked down to the  St. Regis to catch a drink and instead were greeted by the doormen offering the house car for a tour of San Francisco. We accepted.
The driver opened the doors to the beautiful car, we got in, and drove us all over the city showing us different sites and telling us a little history about each location, while my fiance and I sat in back worried that we smelled funny after our rooftop tailgate before the game with friends, but he didn't seem to notice, and we certainly weren't going to bring it up.
After he took us to a few wine bars he inquired about our lust for seafood and asked if he could suggest a spot, so we obliged and he took us to Scoma, but not before making sure a table was ready for us. We arrived and were greeted by an amazing staff and enjoyed some great bites to eat while sipping a fantastic Malbec.
The long and short of it is this, we had a great evening with great food and wine, which cannot be beat by much.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Rate>4</Rate><user_name>John R. Scott</user_name>< Resp>

We visit San Francisco often and seek out good food while we travel. Scomas is a restaurant that was recommended more than once by others.
We finally tried the restaurant and we have to say it is excellent. Ask the waiters what is good and they will advise you...you wont be disappointed.
We tried a few dishes and will make Scomas a regular stop when in S.F.</text>

Very high end but how often can you eat your lunch with such a view. Our waiter Sal was fantastic and the service alone is on point. We ordered the calamari alla pancha which was the perfect amount of spicy. It was accompanied  with a delicous corn bread that balanced out the citrus of the bed of tomato sauce. We also ordered the Pacific Black Cod drizzled in a cream sauce with seasonal vegetables and crispy potatoes. Food was fantastic. Service was amazing. Portion sizes need a bit of work. We still felt a little hungry after our meal. Still a recommended spot.<//Text>

<review>Scoma's, an SF Italian classic.  Bartop review.  Fresh seafood done well.  Skilled artisans as barkeeps.  Casey made a proper Woodford double oaked Manhattan.  The Fritto Misto appetizer had a nice touch of fresh lemon zest on the local and fresh anchovies.  The cioppino entree had a great base and a generous portion of seafood.  Overall a flawless delivery of eats and drinks.  Great service.  Retro modern digs.  Prices more than par for the segment.  Portions more than par.  A hearty 5 stars in the middle of a sea of touristy mediocrity.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Old school food. The grilled seafood platter was 3 x pieces of Over cooked bland fish. They know how to fill simple dishes. The only good thing is that the sizes where so small so it too painful to eat them. This is ap,ace that is designed for topical America that love cover protein with sauces. I don't understand why it's still so busy. I give this place another 5 years when all their regulars and employees will be dead as they are all so old it's like going into the Madame Trussaud wax museum. The worst dine experience in San Fran I ever had in my many visits.</text>

<Name>Steve Pendleton< /Name><Date>1294347651536</Date><Rate>3</Rate><Text>This is an old restaurant that is trying to be old-style elegant. It isn't anything but old style anymore. Yes, the waiters wear white jackets, but the paneling in the dining room just looks...old. The prices are high, even for Fisherman's Wharf. Typical entree is $30+. The service is not excellent. When we arrived it was a very light Monday night crowd, but the hostess would not seat us until our friend who was parking the car arrived five minutes later. When you are really busy I can see this, but not if the restaurant is more than half empty. The quality of the food is mixed. My wife had lamb chops. Two were excellent, one was raw...and tasteless. I had swordfish in a picatta sauce. The fish was excellent, but the sauce was thin. Bottomline: there are better seafood restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf.< /Text>< pictures>

This a great place to go for a late Dinner, or just cocktails. It can be a bit crowded at times, but the views of the Bay and the Table service are worth it.< /Review>

Lively atmosphere with much to watch while you wait. Food is a mixed bag: stick with the simple and straightforward seafood dishes.  Service was formal to the point of being punctillious: but also oddlly sneering and suspicious - the only place during a month in the USA to decline my debit card.</Text>

He made our visit to the city that much better.  I'm sad to say as writing this I can't recall his name :( though I know all servers here will give the same quality service.  The entrées were delicious.  My steak (their version of Kobe)omg, mouth watering.  The purple potatoes were cooked perfectly!  Soft inside with slightly roasted outside.  I did not add salt or pepper to my meal.  That's a sign it was cooked to perfection. My father's meal was also perfect. Our dessert was decadent.  We will definitely visit Scomas next time we're in the city!< /review>< pics>

Old school food. The grilled seafood platter was 3 x pieces of Over cooked bland fish. They know how to fill simple dishes. The only good thing is that the sizes where so small so it too painful to eat them. This is ap,ace that is designed for topical America that love cover protein with sauces. I don't understand why it's still so busy. I give this place another 5 years when all their regulars and employees will be dead as they are all so old it's like going into the Madame Trussaud wax museum. The worst dine experience in San Fran I ever had in my many visits.< /text>

Although we've visited the Fishermans' Wharf area a few times, we'd never spotted Scoma's before our last visit as it's up an alleyway which we'd always walked past. Wish we'd found it earlier, food good, place busy but good vibe, and staff genuinely pleasant.<//Text>

Great Attention given to customers and great interactions with waiters. If you are a fan of sprite or 7-up ask for the lemon-lime,it is the same good 7-up only without the manufactured taste.</Review>

We were there yesterday 9/29/19 and the lady in the front desk was rude and didn’t give us a table until the rest of the group showed up because they were parking the car so we had to wait for 10 minutes so I called my son to make sure if they were close enough and they were5 minutes away and I asked the lady if she can give us a table and she refused to do it again so disappointed 😡</Text>

Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding. Our policy, that most top restaurants in town share, is to only seat a party when it is complete. Otherwise, our servers have to come by extra times as the other people arrive, throwing off the entire flow of the restaurant. We hope you understand. However, we offer complimentary valet parking right at our front door so there should never be any wait at all. Hopefully your meal went well when your party arrived and we hope to see you back soon!"}</resp>

Scoma's is a legacy, but they are just fundamentally being outgrown. Wish they would pare down the menu, update the decor a little bit, and put a little more attention on the waitstaff's skills.

Service was good, appropriately polite and attentive, but kind of clumsy in execution for the intended ambience. E.g. reaching over other guests to serve plates and grate cheese, or forgetting which plate goes where, or just generally awkward interruptions in table conversation and rushed ordering. To be fair, we sat at the bar tables instead of waiting for our reservation.

Food was good but not great. My Bolognese was obviously fresh but the papardelle was sticking and the sauce wasn't much to write home about. Table bread was cold.

I recognize that I'm likely being picky on the details, but based upon the price of the meal, my expectations were higher.

Not 5 stars, but otherwise a good meal and quality service.<//Text>

<review>Smacks of a dying restaurant.  Most of the fish seemed to be from the east coast.  The ingredients  were inexpensive and overcooked, but not inexpensive prices.  The staff was more interested in watching tv at the noisy bar than serving customers.

Fisherman's Wharf has many great restaurants; this is not one of them.< /review>< date>

This is my favorite place!  I wasn't a sea food fan at all until I went, ate what they had.  We went back every night, every time I've been in that beautiful city!  Yup, me a meat & potato guy hooked on anything they offered.</text>

Ambience is amazing, like been inside old Hollywood movie. Mediterranean mussels are great, good Pinot noir by glass. And this place gives Uber credit.<//text>

Food was eh. Calamari was recommended by the staff and was greasy and tough, cooked in old oil. Not worth the money</text>

<Review>We were disappointed in the food and the sitting arrangements. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time but they seated us anyway which was great! However the tables were so close we could not have a private conversation and could certainly hear other table's conversations.  Did not have a nice view either.  The service was pretty good but did not care for the food. Don't get the Dungeness Crab Thermidor Gratinato unless you love onions and not much crab. The Wagyu Bistro Filet was okay and Polenta was good.< /Review></record>

Lively atmosphere with much to watch while you wait. Food is a mixed bag: stick with the simple and straightforward seafood dishes.  Service was formal to the point of being punctillious: but also oddlly sneering and suspicious - the only place during a month in the USA to decline my debit card.< /Review>

Zagat must be slipping... apparently a 25 means: salads made from brown, wilted, store-bought pre-prepared mixes that sat in the back of the fridge too long, mediocre wine selections and crab so overcooked you have to chew on it like a strap of leather.  If you want better seafood, go to a Red Lobster.  Scoma's was singularly terrible in that regard.  No complaints about the atmosphere or the waitstaff though, they did a great job.  It was too bad that when they asked me how everything was, the only nice thing I could say was that the bread was great (and it was).<//Review>

< review>
Ordered bistro filet, wagyu sirloin cut with smashed potatoes, and raw sliced carrots. Presentation wasn't great. Carrots were right; raw and edible. Smashed potatoes were right and cooked well. The 9 oz filet by no means looked like 9oz it was dished up cut in half. The temperature of the steak was more like medium than what was ordered which was supposed to be medium rare. I have had more flavorful and more tender steaks at a chain restaurant.

The waiter Chris was nice and courteous.< /review>

Was sold this restraunt as the best seafood Fishermans wharf had to offer . Ordered the three main specialty dishes on the menu. Scallops were to die for. Amazing. But that was about it . For the price , disappointed . For 280 ( 350 AUD) bucks for 4 people. Sydney fish markets could do for about 120 bucks . Maybe my expectations were to high .</Text>

Great fresh seafood. Chowder is a must try, oysters are fresh and delightful.< /Review>

<Time>1517080810202< /Time><review>Scoma's is a legacy, but they are just fundamentally being outgrown. Wish they would pare down the menu, update the decor a little bit, and put a little more attention on the waitstaff's skills.

Service was good, appropriately polite and attentive, but kind of clumsy in execution for the intended ambience. E.g. reaching over other guests to serve plates and grate cheese, or forgetting which plate goes where, or just generally awkward interruptions in table conversation and rushed ordering. To be fair, we sat at the bar tables instead of waiting for our reservation.

Food was good but not great. My Bolognese was obviously fresh but the papardelle was sticking and the sauce wasn't much to write home about. Table bread was cold.

I recognize that I'm likely being picky on the details, but based upon the price of the meal, my expectations were higher.

Not 5 stars, but otherwise a good meal and quality service.</review>< gmap_id>

<text>Walked in off the street and had about a 15 minute wait to be seated. It was a fairly busy day so there was no place to sit while we waited. They use a texting service to let you know your table is ready, so we just walked around outside.

We started with the fried calamari and it was very good - they cooked it differently then we've ever had it before - big pieces (great dipping sauce too).

After the calamari, we were all actually pretty full so we weren't as hungry for dinner as we would have liked. We had swordfish, shrimp in egg batter and ahi. All were cooked well and tasted good, but not amazing.

Great views from the restaurant, super service, will come back to try the clam chowder!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</gmap_id></record>

<review>Was sold this restraunt as the best seafood Fishermans wharf had to offer . Ordered the three main specialty dishes on the menu. Scallops were to die for. Amazing. But that was about it . For the price , disappointed . For 280 ( 350 AUD) bucks for 4 people. Sydney fish markets could do for about 120 bucks . Maybe my expectations were to high .<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Food and service were both subpar. Never before sent back a dish until today. Unfortunate how this place seems to have declined. At least the oysters were good.<//Text>

However, the mussels tasted pungent, the clams didn’t open up all the way, AND the salmon chunks were SPOILED! When I told the waiter about the clams, he gave me a knife to pry them open. I then discovered the spoiled salmon and send the dish back. The writer smelled it and agreed that it had gone bad. A fresh plate came half and hour later and the flavor was good. However, I developed an upset stomach thereafter and my afternoon/ evening was spoiled. I was glad I didn’t feed this to my 1.5 year old toddler. For a restaurant that has a high turnover and claims to be high in quality, this was an awful experience. No one apologized and the full price of the dish was on the bill.< /review>< GmapID>

Scomas's is an excellent restaurant with great food and fantastic views. The crab (steamed) was great w capers. The garlic shrimp w/ rice aoli was fantastic too. I would highly recommend.</review>

Skip this place. It was recommended to us and we went to this classic and long-established restaurant. A short wait at the bar and we were eating. The service from Jose was friendly, but the food was at best average, and the prices are high ($110 (incl tip) for dinner for 2, no apps or dessert and 2 beer/wine each). The fresh wild salmon was utterly unremarkable, slightly overcooked and with little flavor (I could have easily done better at home any number of ways), and the pasta with sausage was OK but overwhelmed by black olives. Perhaps other things on the menu are better, but at these prices I can't see coming back to eat my way through the menu to find something better than average. Spend your money elsewhere.

Having visited this Scoma's for the first time, in 1985, this place has been incredible every time I have visited it, ever since that time. It would appear that they have adhered to their unremitting dedication to being at the top of their game; and have thrived ever since.</Text>

<review>Calamari alla Plancha was the best calamari dish I have ever enjoyed. The filet was phenomenal, texture and flavour! Our easier was wonderfully professional and helpful south our orders. The entire experience was FAR above what I expected from anything in the tourist district. This is not a tourist restaurant. They are pros. As a New Orleanean, I know great food and service... and Scoma's delivered!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

feel like it was overpriced and over hyped.  food was pretty good and they were good to us by giving us a good seat on our honeymoon.  Waiter was top notch but still didnt feel dinner was worth $75 for just two entrees and a beer.< /Text>

We on a whim decided to go to Fisherman's Warf. Found Scoma's and decided we need not go any further. I mean what could be better than eating fresh fish right off the warf. We were not dissapointed!!! The food was amazing best Cod, Scallops,Shrimp, Salad and Fried Calimari ever. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and a pleasure. Thank you all from Top to Bottom fir your excellence. I will defiantly return. Blessings!!!</review>

I had black cod with lemon aoli over smashed potatoes. Van, our waiter (maybe Dan - older gentleman from Chicago) told me it was good, gave me a description, and I, a lady who doesn't like strong tasting fish, LOVED IT!!!!  We started with soup, my husband had clam chowder, I had the lobster bisque. Excellent start to a wonderful meal. We finished with the 7 layer cake; chocolatey, hazelnutty, creamy, crunchy, but not over sweet. The perfect end to a perfect meal! The only part of the meal not extraordinary was the bread - just ordinary bread that was cold in the center. Thank you Scomas for an absolutely delicious meal. Parking is valet - when you start down Al Scomas Way, go over the bridge, make the turn and the valets take it from there. No charge (we tipped).</Review>

Literally one of the most northern-most places in SF - Scoma's is a seafood-ish restaurant, slightly overpriced, but the food IS delicious. The servers are friendly & affable, the bathroom is kind of crowded, but in general, this is a nice, fancy place - perfect for business lunches/dinners, and maybe romantic dates.<//Review>

This is an "Old School" Italian Seafood Restaurant.....perfect.....our two most favorite foods (Italian and Seafood) and we LOVE anything "Old School."
Upon entering.....you immediately get the 60's vibe.  We went for My 50th Birthday lunch....so had every intention of hanging for a bit with a bottle of wine and of course some Birthday dessert.....all those things that really help to run up the bill....and we didn't care one bit. We were seated in the back upper level. The dining room was not very big and they made sure to seat everyone in one section so it was hard to have any real conversation. We ordered a cocktail while looking over the menu. We both decided on Seafood. My husband ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Dungeness Crab Salad, with a bottle of wine to come w/the meal. Our lunches were brought to the table and as soon as the server walked away, my husband looked at his fish and said "this doesn't look good"  I looked at the fish and could see what he was talking about.....it looked so dried out. He took a few bites and it was awful. My salad was ok....it was supposed to be shelled crab. Of course every bite I took, I had to pull shell out of my mouth. Shelled=Means no shell or cartilage. I can understand a bite or two w/shell but this was ridiculous. The server forgot the wine and we were so glad.....because we were so unhappy that we just wanted to get out of there.  We couldn't believe this is what was served for the price. Our bill was was $125......before tip.  We didn't bother to send the food back because we figured everything was going to come out just as bad.  So totally disappointed! I think the chef needs more training or they need to have better quality control. Would NEVER recommend this establishment.< /text>

One of the few restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf does does a nice job. The Cioppino is 5 star, other menu favorites are Shrimp and Scallops alla Gannon and Shellfish Sauté Sec.

Only be overpriced knocks them down one star.< /Text>

< Review>
I have been to Scoma's now four times over the course of nine years. I have had wonderful experiences every time. The views are beautiful and the seafood is GREAT! I have never had such good seafood. I have had the  Dungeness crab cocktail, Gulf shrimp pastina, and the whole dungeness crab. Each of which were AMAZING! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area. I think it goes unrecognized because it is down an alley toward the warf. I will be back sometime again in the future.</Review>

< Review>
We checked online and yelp and found it is a great place to go but very disappointed. Food are not as advertised "fresh" seafood, the seafood looks very frozen prior.....not taste and not too many people there. I will not recommend it. I believe it was a good place and talked to people that night, the restaurant goes downhill recent years.<//Review>

< Review>
Magic... from the service and setting to the reheated leftover linguini democratica  (frutti di mar) the next day.  An absolute gem off the beaten path.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Not too stuffy either, a very relaxed and fun atmosphere.</Review>

Years ago, thanks to Bob and Yvonne Whitelock I got to experience this establishment that had been a favorite restaurant for decades.  We had a wonderful meal, experience, and truly enjoyed some San Francisco history.</Review>

<Text>Nice seafood,  very good local crab, good wines by the glass,  friendly and efficient staff.  Price vs quality probably not bad for the area although overpriced in my view. Would definitely recommend it though if you're in the area.< /Text><user_name>Tom Vervoort<//user_name><response>None</response><Date>1485386108617< /Date>< rating>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Went to resturant on recomendation. Expected fresh fish off the boat but they had none. No specials. Food was overpriced, but your paying for the area. Waiter was a older gentelman and very surley, service was sub par. Location was great. The meals that were ordered were fast and of average quality. I would not recomend.<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
Gang:

This Restaurant is tops, the sourdough frenchbread is the best!!

Yes it is busy but so are all great places... so be smart if you are going to be on the Wharf, make rez & go window shopping & come back in an hour enjoy it dont sweat it.

But.... I hate the rez booth up 4-5 feet above your head ..."strange"
Bottomline after dinner go to the Buena Vista a few blocks away!!

Have a great time Mike #32</review>

{'time': 1592014083583, 'text': "Yuri, if you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up, please know Scoma's has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\nThis is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales.\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation."}< /resp>

The best seafood we have ever found in North America.  We travel to San Francisco to eat at Scoma's.<//text>

We've been to Scoma's many times over the years while visiting San Francisco and have always enjoyed our meals here, but we were disappointed on this trip. The service as always was outstanding, but the food was not as good as it has been in the past. Lots of money for lunch that was at best mediocre.< /review>

Given the reputation, we disappointed that the experience didn't live up to the hype.</Text>

<Review>Outrageously overrated. Anyone who likes this place must usually eat at the Olive Garden. The wait staff was disinterested at best, and for the (stupidly high) price the food was unimpressive. Eat there if you must, but there are better places.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /GmapID></record>

Water was not served 10 minutes after seated down. Server did not pick up order for at least 15 minutes. Not recommended this place for its awful service.</Text>

A surprising gem among the tourist trap wasteland that is Fisherman's Wharf.

A bit pricey perhaps, but they've got solid seafood.<//Text>

My family highly recommended I eat the freshest fish of the day, and I am so glad I did! The clam chowder, IPA, and Halibut with a view of the Golden gate bridge at Golden hour was something special!< /Review>

Our experience at Scomas San Francisco was delightful. The food was delicious and the fish was perfectly cooked. The best part of the meal was Tim our waiter. He was funny, sassy and knowledgeable. He made our dining there extremely enjoyable. I would definitely go back and ask for Tim.<//review>

(Translated by Google) A place served by elderly waiters. Both the cram chowder and the crab were excellent. Parking is valet, and there is no separate fee.

(Translated by Google) Great service from the charming waiters in a fish restaurant, in whose nostalgic interior you immediately lose yourself :-) If you want to go out to eat in style without dressing too chic, this is the place for you. Portions are big enough, prices are high for German standards (a large shrimp salad around 45 euros), but tasty.

(Original)
Super Service durch die charmanten Kellner in einem Fischrestaurant, in dessen nostalgischem Interieur man sich sofort verliert :-) wer stilvoll Essengehen möchte, ohne sich dafür zu chic kleiden zu wollen, ist hier richtig. Portionen sind ausreichend  groß, Preise sind für deutsche Verhältnisse gehoben (ein großer Krabbensalat um die 45 Euro), dennoch lecker.</review>

(Translated by Google) We stopped by for lunch. It was delicious seafood. Share salad, clam chowder, and today's seafood grill one by one, just right. I ordered a glass of beer for this and it cost $ 100 including a tip. The price is high, but I am satisfied with the taste and service.

(Translated by Google) A small restaurant hidden in the fishing port of San Francisco
The sunset outside the window is paired with simple and extraordinary food
An endless stream of people, full of the human touch of the store
I don’t feel messy, but warm and relaxed

(Translated by Google) The food is good, especially the crab sauce fried garlic cream is delicious, but the food price is very expensive, the service staff is older, the age of guests is also higher, creating a traditional American-style human service, more suitable for older people . Expensive is the only disadvantage I have seen. After the meal, lemon and hot towel will be provided.

(Original)
食物不錯，尤其螃蟹的醬料炸蒜香奶油很好吃，但是食物價格很貴，服務人員年齡偏高，客人年齡層也偏高，營造出傳統美式富有人情味的服務，較適合年長的人。貴是我看到的唯一缺點。用餐完會提供檸檬跟熱毛巾。</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) A well-known seafood restaurant recommended by local Americans, one each in San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf and Sausalito Beach. It is a little historical and word-of-mouth restaurant. When we arrived it was more than three in the afternoon, there were no one, the service was very kind and very experienced and recommended dishes. The taste is very good, the seafood is fresh, and the wine selection is also many, and the overall price is high

美國當地人推薦的知名海鮮餐廳，在舊金山漁人碼頭和Sausalito海邊各有一間店，是間有點歷史且有口碑的餐廳。我們到的時候是下午三點多，沒有什麼人，服務很客氣很好，也很有經驗的推薦菜色。口味很好，吃的出海鮮的新鮮，供應的酒選擇也不少，整體價位偏高<//review>< username>

(Translated by Google) A classic Italian seafood restaurant on the water in San Francisco. They have a great selection of fish, seafood, crab and a single steak.
The dishes are on the expensive end - $ 35-40 for a main course, but the portions are large so you can plentifully settle for a lunch. We got Linguine alla Vongole and Pasta Putanesca. The wine is pricey and OK. The beers are cheaper. Their double IPA is fantastic. Try a cocktail while you wait. The lemon kiss (Bacio al Limone) is excellent.
The service is classic, good and attentive.
Can be recommended if you can afford it.

En klassisk italiensk seafood restaurant på vandet i San Francisco. De har et stort udvalg af fisk, skaldyr, krabbe og en enkelt bøf.
Retterne er i den dyre ende - 35-40$ for en hovedret, men portionerne er store, så man kan rigeligt nøjes med en ret til frokost. Vi fik Linguine alla Vongole og Pasta Putanesca . Vinen er dyr og OK. Øllene er billigere. Deres double IPA er fantastisk. Smag gerne en cocktail, mens du venter. Citronkys (Bacio al Limone) er fremragende.
Betjeningen er klassisk, god og opmærksom.
Kan anbefales, hvis man har råd til det.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Seafood restaurant located in the port of San Francisco. The quality of the food quite bad, products without flavor, the spaghetti vongole undercooked and with a lot of liquid (we assume that they were not drained). The cesar salad was 4 regular lettuce leaves and 4 very salty croutons. Seafood quite tasteless. Very expensive for its quality and the living room needs updating after years.

La calidad de la comida bastante mala, productos sin sabor, los espaguetis vongole mal cocinados y con mucho líquido (suponemos de no haberlos escurrido). La ensalada cesar eran 4 hojas de lechuga regulares y con 4 crustones muy salados. El marisco bastante insípidos. Muy caro para su calidad y el salón necesita una reforma después de años.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr0tArp6kbIjtPt58DxT-yHj3W_y8Jh5I4IL2X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGDYyzwrnGWrQ8vRjERGAO5hIBjzxzZJPi56Je=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-GzPA14in0v_8FF4eJeEb0IJIuY4MPlGMijq0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9ExHNN0CiyDtVnk01HRR98z0DvRRxaYNlSXsm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrwKpI2W1qw-Xy0FQmnJSl3hFToW-0QuiS-nqU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo-YuBTDxGKzMzGrD7tnTLStuyWLacDpfwNpRc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Seafood at Pier 39 is a high end. Of course you can enter comfortably without the dress code. There is a little price. 2 beer, 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 160 for US $ 200,000

Chiofino delicious! Kkalra Marie Fries, Cram chowder is also good
The grill is saw

Pyeonyira weighted long side haldeut reservations. If you search a beer or a cocktail at the bar while waiting. Immediately gave instructions do not just sit down to wait in the bar located off the table when the zoom menu

치오피노 맛있음! 깔라마리 튀김, 크램차우더도 굿
그릴은 쏘쏘

웨이팅이 긴편이라 예약이 편할듯. 기다리는 동안 바에서 맥주나 칵테일 한잔하면 됨. 따로 바로 안내는 안해주니 그냥 바 자리에 앉아서 테이블 기다린다고 하면 메뉴 줌< /text>

(Translated by Google) Perhaps the restaurant I tried in the USA, which looks more like an Italian restaurant. The white jacket waiters, in keeping with the decor and part of the menu, seem to come directly from the 60s. Good food, nice staff. Not really cheap.

(Translated by Google) It is in a place where you can feel the refreshing sea breeze. A famous seafood restaurant on the east coast of the United States. The waiting time was very long, but I think it's definitely worth the wait. Enjoy NAPA wines and fresh seafood. The price is not cheap, but the seasoning of the food and the atmosphere inside the restaurant go beyond that. It is a high-quality shop with a high degree of satisfaction. Satisfaction, satisfaction, great satisfaction Thank you for your treat. If you have a chance to go to the United States on the west coast, you definitely want to visit this one.

(Translated by Google) Raw oysters, clam chowder, it was very delicious.

Crabs are delicious, but Japan is delicious.
The crab may not have been a delicious season, but considering the price, I personally feel that it is not at a level that I recommend.
However, since crabs with garlic oil have never been eaten in Japan, there are times when you experience it. It is delicious to eat the remaining garlic oil in the pan.

The mixed seafood grill was delicious, but the taste is within the expected range, not until it breaks the expectations.
As for the Japanese people, after all seafood has a high level, ..., strengthened the completely selfish personal view.

(If you don't compare it to the food in Hokkaido, it's delicious enough. I think it's good enough if you're hoping to be able to feel that there's also delicious seafood in the US.)

(Original)
生牡蠣、クラムチャウダー、とても美味しかったです。

カニは、まあ美味しいけど、日本のが美味しいかなー。
カニが美味しい旬の時期ではなかったのかもですが、値段を考えると必ずおすすめするほどのレベルにまでにはない気が個人的にはします。
ただ、ガーリックオイルでのカニは日本では食べたことがなかったので、経験しておくのもありでしょう。残ったガーリックオイルをパンにつけて食べるのは美味しいですよ。

ミックスシーフードグリルも美味しかったけど、期待の範囲内の美味しさで、期待を突き破るまでではなく、、、
日本人のがやっぱりシーフードはレベルが高いかな、、、との全く勝手な個人的見解を強めました。

(北海道での食事と比較しなければ、十分に美味しいですよ。アメリカでも美味しいシーフードがあるんだなという気持ちになれることを期待しての訪問なら十分に良いと思います。)< /text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>(Translated by Google) The location is very good. Clam chowder has many ingredients and it is delicious, but I felt a lot of saltiness (depending on taste). I went there in winter, but oysters are very small, I think that they are not very satisfied if they are Japanese oyster lovers. It may be unusual for clams to eat raw clams. Seafood fried was quite tasty. The beer was not very cold. The staff who corresponded was very kind.

<text>(Translated by Google) If you want to try fresh, good quality fish and seafood of all kinds, this is the place for you. The restaurant gets its fish directly from the fishing boats. It couldn't be fresher! The price is high, but you also get extremely good service. Very friendly waiters who also help with the selection of the dishes. If you don't want to wait, a reservation is required.
For two people, we paid $ 120 for a full meal, including a tip.

(Original)
Wer frischen, qualitativ guten Fisch und Meeresfrüchte aller Art probieren will, ist hier richtig. Das Restaurant bekommt seinen Fisch direkt von den Fischerbooten. Frischer geht es nicht! Der Preis ist gehoben, dafür bekommt man aber auch einen außerordentlich guten Service. Sehr freundliche Kellner die auch bei der Auswahl der Speisen zur Seite stehen. Wenn man nicht warten will ist eine Reservierung erforderlich.
Für 2 Personen haben wir für eine volle Mahlzeit inkl. Trinkgeld 120 Dollar bezahlt.< /text>< userid>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I state that during my stay in the States, speaking as an Italian, I had a lot of difficulty eating well as we do in Italy, even at renowned restaurants. In this case, however, I have to say that expectations have been largely met. excellent Sicilian dishes, oysters spectacular and best American ever drank white wine. To try.

(Original)
Premetto che durante il soggiorno negli States, parlando da italiano, ho avuto parecchie difficoltà nel mangiar bene come da noi in Italia, anche presso ristoranti blasonati. In questo caso però, devo dire che le aspettative sono state ampiamente soddisfatte. Piatti siciliani ottimi, Ostriche spettacolari e miglior vino bianco statunitense mai bevuto.

(Translated by Google) Fisherman's Wharf's long-established Italian seafood. We recommend the classic tomato-based seafood stew cioppino. There are 4-5 people lightly, so the veteran waiter recommended a small crab cakes (appetizer size). (Dinner size comes with 3 crab cakes with pasta)

<Review>(Translated by Google) Because this meal has a great impression on Fisherman's Wharf, it is not enough to eat all the seafood services that you want to eat about 45 knives per person. The crab is very fat and the lobster is also tender and tender. Because I wanted to eat butter mushroom sauce and want to eat onion sauce, the chef specially made these three kinds of sauces for us, which was surprisingly delicious. It was a bit unpleasant to find a seat at first, but then another grandfather asked us in detail about what we wanted to eat and how to do it. Specifically, we changed the plate and pepper for many times, and asked for a good meal at the right time. Sour bread is free and there is a free lemon hot handkerchief, which is always recommended by conscience!

(Original)
因为这顿饭对渔人码头印象超棒啊，人均45刀左右能吃到所有想吃的海鲜服务没得说。螃蟹非常肥美龙虾也是外焦里嫩。因为既想吃奶油蘑菇酱又想吃洋葱酱，主厨为我们特意做了这三样酱汁混合的，出奇意料的好吃。一开始找座子有点不愉快，但是之后又一位大爷为我们详细询问介绍我们想吃什么以及怎么做。特意为我们换了好多次盘子加胡椒粉，在恰到好处的时间来询问是否用餐愉快。酸面包是免费的还有免费的柠檬热手帕，总而言之良心推荐！</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

All of San Francisco is very expensive, and our prices are based on our using the highest-quality, most sustainable seafood available. We support small local fishermen and only use seafood that meets or exceeds the high standards set by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program. We feel a responsibility to do so and even so, our prices are still in line with other restaurants in town with similar high levels of service. Unfortunately, most restaurants opt for the least expensive seafood they can source, but we know our customers appreciate our efforts and we hope to see you back again.

Because it is a popular store, it needs a waiting time of around 60 minutes (Friday).
The waiter was very responsive.
The raw oysters were big and delicious. Seafood pasta was the best.
The price is high.

By cons quantities are there.
But nice corner. Not sure that it is just as pleasant during the tourist season.
In February: perfect! :-)

(Translated by Google) Don't let the location (or the outside) put you off: super delicious seafood, very pleasant atmosphere and very friendly and attentive condition! Absolutely authentic dinner.

(Translated by Google) Really everything very good. Book by appointment because there are usually many people to eat (at least in August). As I say, every dish is more than delicious, although accustomed to the prices of Spain perhaps I saw it a bit expensive. But we already know that the United States is like that.

To eat good fish, I don't think there is any better place in Fisherman's Warf.

(Original)
Realmente todo muy bueno. Reservar con cita previa porque suele haber mucha gente para comer ( como mínimo en Agosto ). Como digo, todo plato está más que delicioso, aunque acostumbrado a los precios de España quizás lo ví un poco caro. Pero ya sabemos que estados unidos es así.

Para comer buen pescado, no creo que haya ningún sitio mejor en Fisherman's Warf.</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I was there 10 years ago and went back to dinner with my wife and sister. The fish very well. I can only recommend my scampi platter. Where we were sitting it was a bit narrow than where I was sitting 10 years ago. Staff very friendly and coming before.

(Original)
Ich war vor 10 jahren dort und war mit meine Frau und Schwester beim Essen wieder da. Der Fisch sehr gut. Meine Scampi Platte kann ich nur empfehlen. Wo wir sassen war es etwas eng als wo ich vor 10 jahren gesessen bin. Personal sehr freundlich und zuvor kommend.<//review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Escape from the rush of the promenade crowd by forking in this alley that leads you to the docks, in the middle of small fishing boats ... There you will find Scoma's, a chic (but affordable) restaurant where stars, including Marilyn Monroe, liked to go ...
A warm welcome, a pleasant atmosphere, a nice view and delicious fish specialties. The restaurant has its own fishing fleet.

French: think of the tip by adding 15-20% to the note presented (10% if the service was bad, but there, it will surprise me).

(Original)
Évadez-vous de la cohue de la foule de la promenade en bifurquant dans cette ruelle qui vous amène sur les quais, au milieu de petits bateaux de pêche… Là, vous trouverai Scoma’s, un restaurant chic (mais abordable) où des stars, dont Marilyn Monroe, aimaient aller…
Un accueil des plus chaleureux, un ambiance agréable, une jolie vue et des spécialités de poissons délicieuses. Le restaurant possède sa propre flotte de pêche.

Français : pensez au pourboire en ajoutant 15-20 % à la note présentée (10 % si le service était mauvais, mais là, ça m’étonnerai).<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very good restaurant a little away from the tourist area. The fish is very good and fresh. The restaurant setting is on a pontoon between the boats. In addition there is parking for customers. To do on fisherman.

(Original)
Tres bon restaurant un peu a l ecart de la zone touristique. Le poisson est tres bon et frais. Le cadre du restaurant est sur un ponton entre les bateaux. En plus il y a un parking pour les clients. A faire sur fisherman.</Text>

{'time': 1592014223974, 'text': 'Dmitry,  it seems like you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up. Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}<//Resp>

<response>{'time': 1592014209971, 'text': 'Kristina, it seems like you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up. Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}< /response><userid>116735751752445026374<//userid><username>Kristina Feller</username><pics>None< /pics><Time>1591986500602<//Time></record>
