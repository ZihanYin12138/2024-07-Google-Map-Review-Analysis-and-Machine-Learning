Great location right on the Esplanade Beach with some amazing views of the bay, not too far from Colma Bart Station and located right on SamTrans Bus Routes. Good Amenities including the Club House and Covered Parking Garage.

A big shoutout to the staff here - Zee and Mike. Zee is a special person who loves her job and ensures everything is taken care of!</text>

I just finished moving out of my apartment at OceanAire after living there for 9 months. I was moving to the Bay Area and needed to find something quick, easy, and safe and OceanAire was just that. I knew I couldn't stay long term due to it being out of my budget but it would be manageable for the short term with money I had saved. If money wasn't an issue I would have never left! They're pricey but it's definitely worth it.

Not only is the quality of living very high but their team of staff is what makes them truly stand out. Gina helped me from the beginning, showing me the units that were available and everything else after with getting approved and signing the lease. She should be the standard for leasing agents, so patient, warm and personable, and not pushy whatsoever.

The manager, Zee is also one of the nicest people I've come across in the CA rental industry. She's incredibly responsive to emails and any issues and is really everything you'd want in an apartment manager.

Maintenance requests were always resolved very quickly which was really nice. I really can't think of 1 bad or negative thing over the last 9 months I spent there. Definitely an amazing place to live if you have the chance, take it!</Review>

Loved living there!  Had to move because rent went up too much, otherwise I'd still be there.  The view everyday is breathtaking. Good complex with attentive staff.< /text>

I really enjoyed my stay at OceanAire. The places are very well kept, as are the grounds. All my neighbors were really friendly. I enjoy having the car garage as well. The location is next to Safeway, and a few really good food places. My favorite is Camelot, I really like their chicken strips and fries.

Zee was the person I enjoyed working with most. She is a really genuine, sweet, and helpful person. I always enjoyed visiting with her, and she was very prompt and professional in all my dealings.

I would highly recommend OceanAire! Please tell Zee that Phil says hello if this review prompted you to contact OceanAire. She will be sure to take care of you.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I’ve been living here for a year and a half now and I love it. I’m just blocks away from the ocean with a really nice cliff path. Compared to other similar apartments in the area the rent here is decent. The property is really pet friendly which was a huge plus for me. They’ve also done a lot of updating and it looks really nice! The office staff is friendly, and maintenance is fast too. Most of the apartments seem to have in-unit laundry, plus there are multiple laundry rooms on the property. It’s a quiet area, stays cool and foggy most of the time, which I like. In addition to garage parking there is plenty of street parking in the neighborhood as well.<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
Me and my friends were looking for a new one bedroom apartment close to San Francisco. We explored around 15 apartment complexes in South San Francisco. We set our priority according following criterias - location, price and conditions. Oceanarie Apartments is the one which met our expectations. It's located just by Pacific Ocean and 15 mins away from SF. Townhouses are renovated newly both exterior and interior. Also, we got $2000 off for signing lease agreement as a promotion. Now we are living here for last 6 months, and thinking to resign our lease for another 9 months. Special thanks to Veronica Avelar and Marisol Espino from leasing office. They are helpful. Also, beach access was restored, so now we have a full access to the beach</review>

I moved in 4 months ago and this has been going on for 3 months. It's 6 days a week of noise and 7 days a week of inconvenience, unsightly equipment, multiple dumpsters, materials, trash, construction vehicles and debris. My parking is in the other half of the complex, across the street, so I've been dealing with the mess since the beginning of the demo in June.

For over a month, the gym was closed, the common "oceanview patio with free wifi" was covered in junk, the common rec room was closed, and even the office was closed. They haven't used their app even once to broadcast messages to tenants. The grounds have been a disaster since mid-June -- as if they're not even going to pretend to keep up appearances.

In July, I stopped going down to look at the ocean, because they were ripping apart the buildings facing the ocean and it was just too depressing to see the mess everywhere. (PS - they said they were going to restore beach access that was washed out earlier in the year, but I'm not holding my breath. Google Maps still shows the path, but it's gone. Also the Oceanaire property map shows an ocean path, which is not there.)

They haven't done anything to contain the  work to a particular section of the property and complete one building before beginning demo on an adjacent building. Instead they work on another building on the opposite end. They are randomly criss-crossing lengthwise across the property (south-north) instead of working east-west). The way they're doing it, it's as if they're purposely trying to MAXIMIZE the  inconvenience of everyone and make it so that nothing looks pretty or peaceful or at all like home.

I was only given 6 days notice on 9/1 to clear my patio before 9/8 and to keep my windows closed for 2 months for renovation to my building. I had purchased $300 of patio furniture and plants when I moved here, not knowing that they were planning a major renovation and everything would all have to be stored inside.  4 days into my apartment renovation, the wrecking crew cut an electrical line to my kitchen and my refrigerator was without power for about 30 hours (and I'll have to toss everything). In the response to my online Maintenance request early that evening 9/12, a technician showed up at my door at 11:45 pm(!) and left at 12:45 am(!) without any resolution. The 2nd day they brought an extension cord. The 3rd day an electrician came to repair it and left the fridge hooked up to the extension cord and left a mess. The 4th day they came back to plug the fridge in properly and remove the extension cord (because I complained) and they still left the mess on the countertop, plus white handprints on my black fridge and countertop.  My 2nd story balcony was left completely exposed on 1 side for 3 days before they boarded it up. The front porch lights have been ripped off for 3 daya now and it's difficult to watch for hazards at night, especially because they leave junk everywhere in the walkways.

There has been no offer to reduce the rent and I've contacted a lawyer.

I was honestly very excited when I moved here. Working in the city, being a new person to the Bay Area, it seemed the perfect escape from the loud city, right on a sea cliff. It ended up being 9 months of Hell. I moved in last year right after the ownership switched from private to corporate (to Trinity properties) and right before the massive and invasive remodel. I was glad to read some of these other reviews echoing my frustrations. The office staff, a few in particular, have a way of dismissing you as the only one with an issue, when that's far from the truth. I have rented in most major cities in California due to my profession, and this is the only place I've ever had issues with like these. To start, the remodel was so invasive that people probably shouldn't have been in their units while it was done, all the outer walls were taken and left off on my building and left off for a few days due to the weather. This lead to my unit becoming infested with mice in July of 2017. Today, in January of 2018, I still have a mouse infestation. The leasing office is completely incompetent, my agent in particular is unprofessional, lacks overall knowledge, is unreliable and uncommunicative, and often doesn't even return calls, emails, or follow up. Working with her has given me so much stress and anxiety because I cannot rely on her to do her job. In the several months I've had mice, the exterminator came maybe half a dozen times, and only left sticky traps and one poison trap, which he never checks. So anything dead, just rots while I wait. The first time he showed up he had told us directly that the removal of the walls caused the mice, which he told the office, but the office denies of course. Most maintenance requests take a very long wait and for many of my requests I had to call and email because it was just sitting open without resolve OR it was closed when no work had been done. This is no offense to the maintenance, I actually like the head of maintenance and feel for them. He is often exacerbated with the office as well and stressed and they are clearly overworked, having to fix massive holes, for example, to the inner walls when the construction team would blast through them. This is just the tip of the iceberg, I could write a novel to be honest. I have pictures of the mice filth and damage to my personal property as well as emails showing the blatant negligence, which upper management from Trinity are CC'd on and they still do nothing. Despite my right to abandon the property and/or withhold rent due to the mouse issue in the state of California, when I gave my notice, the agent nonchalantly asked for the early lease break fee with no due date. I assumed then, after 2 unanswered f/u emails, that this was all due by my last day (like all other apartment leases I've read/signed), but apparently it wasn't because another agent called yesterday to let me know my account was in the red and I was being sent to their lawyers today just 2 weeks after I gave notice... I was never notified prior, so all I can assume is the ignorant agent who has had my lease this whole time either made these notes because she's trying to screw me out of some retaliation for the many complaints on her service or she's that incompetent. After my experience here, either is equally possible. I've spoken with my lawyer and he advised I can just abandon without paying considering the conditions but I was just going to pay so I could be done with them. However, now after this new issue AND seeing another mouse last night, I feel maybe I should let them take me to court so I can bring all the I have evidence against them. I'm just so exhausted with it all. I want to meet with the office manager to explain all of this, but I doubt he/she would even care. These people care about money, like any corporation, not people, that's clear. I do appreciate the one good office employee who called to warn me of the account issue yesterday, and certainly I feel for her as well. Please do yourself a favor and move anywhere but here, it's just an awful place.<//review>

All apartments are the same. Deposits are not deposits when it comes to apartment life. It would be a lot easier if they just lumped them with upfront costs so that there is zero expectation you will get any money back when your lease ends.

We moved in Jan. of 2018. Rent was 2750. My rent spring of 2020 went up to 3400. I guess that is just Pacifica! When our lease ended a few weeks ago, we scrubbed every baseboard, bought special cleaner for the oven, cleaned the walls and cabinets, etc. Spent an entire day cleaning. They charged me 150 cleaning fee. 150 carpet cleaning fee (even though I paid 100 a month extra for my pets) and charged me for misc rent when I moved out a week prior to our lease ending on the 31st. We loved living at this apt and have left positive reviews in the past. Seems so simple to just be honest. It’s not even the money that is the problem as much as the lack of transparency. I spent over 85,000 in rent over the course of two years and they are going to nickel and dime me over a cleaning fees???<//Review>

We love living here! Our unit has been nicely updated and the location is perfect. One of our favorite things about living here is the friendly staff. I always feel welcome in the club house. Mike and Gina are always so friendly and Zee always greets us by name!  We also find the maintenance staff to be friendly and professional (Hey Dalton, we’re talking about you!)
Our service requests (3 minor requests) were all addressed within 24 hours. I’ve lived in other apartment communities were that was not the case!  Aside from the staff, we enjoy the small, but equipped, gym, the beach access and the spacious patios.  We would highly recommend this community! Thanks.< /review>

This place has a serious rat problem, probably caused by the fact that every resident has their own outdoor trash can that sits feet from the door. I constantly see rats perched on my neighbors trashcans in the morning and at night, and have found their droppings in my unit. I have tried everything, no trash indoors, rat poison, but cannot seem to get rid of them. Oceanaire has provided 0 help and mainly denied the well known rat infestation.<//text>

<review>Our showing was amazing, Gina was very informative, professional, and you could tell she loves her job. We have experienced prompt maintenance repair.
Although the office has been very slow to reply to my emails, if they reply at all. We were told if we signed a lease by a certain day we would get a $750 visa gift card, we never got it. I have emailed the office about it 4 times, only once getting a response saying they would get back to me and that it should show up in 2 weeks. That was in November and unfortunately we still have not seen or heard anything about it. I also emailed asking about the guest suite, hoping to rent it for my family when they come visit, never got a response about that either.
We love our community and our unit, but unfortunately the staff care and response after move-in has been VERY disappointing.
Why do I read other great recent reviews about positive responsiveness but have not received the same myself? 😞</review>< pics>

<Text>I have lived at Oceanaire apartment homes for over a year now. The view is great, but don't expect to be able to reach management via the phone or for them to be of any help, or honest.

Normally if you call the leasing office it routes you to a 3rd party company to someone who is in another state...not super helpful if your kitchen is flooding for the third time in a year and you have to shuffle pots and pans full of dirty water every 10 mins or couple of hours for days while not being able to use your kitchen sink or dishwasher. During the pandemic since you cannot walk into the leasing office you can actually get them on he phone, I wouldn't expect that to continue once things resume to normal and they can cut costs.

Maintenance told me the cause of the flooding was the kitchen faucet being installed incorrectly (explains why the kitchen sink turned cold when the faucet indicated hot)

You would think thats the worst right?

During the superbowl my car was damaged by a 6 or so foot long and 2 foot wide piece of roofing tile that came loose that they have failed to repair to this day, 4 months+ after it happened, while my car was parked in between my building and the neighboring one in one of the 3 parking spaces available (if you move here realize it's one assigned parking space per unit and that you will not be able to find a spot on the street past 11PM due to all the homeless living in campers).

Despite the employees expressing sympathy for their property causing damage and significant depreciation to the value of my vehicle, and initialize accepting responsibility, their manager has refused to share their insurance company's information with me so that I can have them cover the $500 deductible.

The garage doors here constantly break and are left open so residents can use their vehicles, so if you own motorcycles don't think they will be safe here, or expect your vehicles to be secure. A few months ago my neighbor had their car window smashed our and their car looted in the garage, fyi.

Oceanaire apparently has valet trash service, I see it itemized on my bill every month, funny my "valet trashcan" disappeared two months ago.

When I initially was checking out Oceanaire the unit I rented was unavailable, so I had to tour a neighboring one.

When I inquired as to whether or not the advertised fireplace worked, I was told "kind of". What they meant was that the fireplace is sealed, but they were kind enough to install a cheap set of fake logs that have lights built into them, look fake and make a loud buzzing noise when turned on, not exactly great for watching TV in your living room or setting the mood for a date.

The hot tub is constantly broken. Prior to the pandemic I think I had access to it about 40% of the time I lived here. When I first moved in the jets in the hot tub were broken....I complained and they pretended it never had jets, even though it had a button to turn them on and and they would weakly run....several months later we got an email exclaiming they had "upgraded the hot tub to include jets". Ah yes, they must have bought the base model. These people treat you as if you just fell off the back of the turnip truck.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1592427612925, 'text': 'Tucker, thank you for sharing your concerns with our communication, customer service, upkeep, and atmosphere.

This picturesque property is situated right next to the ocean! I hope you'll find it as beautiful and serene as I did when I visited. The black sand beach below offers many opportunities to relax after a stressful day.

The apartments are well equipped with amenities that you'd find at a hotel resort. The staff are super friendly! Mike and Marisol are especially helpful and very resourceful. Their knowledge of the community and the surrounding area was very impressive. They made me feel so welcomed and right at home!<//Review>

I've been at OceanAire longer than most; four years in November. Over the years the community has had its ups & downs - most noticeably when it underwent major construction for about a year (which drove many of the negative reviews online). They've made some great positive changes since then, most notably in management of the community. This remains a really nice place to live - quiet, comfortable, and with an ideal location right on the ocean. The staff are terrific. They are highly responsive and the maintenance team is the best (particular shoutouts to Mike, Zee, and Omar).
With that said, lately I've been disappointed with the amenities that OceanAire promotes front & center on their website as a value-add to residents. That lovely spa that you see on the home page? Hasn't worked for months; basically all summer. The fitness center? Machines are frequently broken or not properly maintained, and bizarrely there is a personal trainer running her business out of it all day which monopolizes the equipment. Be careful investing too much value in the beach access, because this part of the coastline experiences major erosion, which means restoration efforts need to happen which block or disrupt that access. (The access was closed for over a year when a sinkhole took out a chunk of the path, and as of the time of writing this review the beach is a major construction site due to a necessary rebuild of the seawall.)

While considering a move to the area I was  recommended to check out this company. It's a beautiful area and Marisol was very helpful. Unfortunately work my work situation changed we are no longer moving up north, but we will diffidently keep it in mind in the future. Great place, totally worth checking out.</Review>

< Review>
Oceanaire is beautiful. I’ve loved living there so much but 3 weeks after asking for my offer letter they sent me an offer for 6 months which was my current rent agreement at $300 more per month than what I pay currently. I begged them to keep my rent as close to the same price as possible and they declined recommending I sign a 15 month lease which is still close to $100 more per month than what I pay now. I’m heartbroken to leave but I’m not surprised that this is how they conduct business.<//Review>

I had a short term lease this past summer while working at SFO.  Zee was the first person I met when checking out the place, and her sunny attitude matched the beautiful day.  The next three months were a gift of summer on the beach, unmarred by any element at Oceanaire.  Stopping in the office with any questions, or just to say Hi to Gina was always a pleasant and helpful occasion, even when it was to ask when the spa would re-open (it’s closure was not uncommon).  Maintenance staff was always ready to help with any of my requests to borrow a screwdriver for a minute, due to the fact I had left all my tools at home in the Valley.
Upon terminating my contract, a snag came up regarding term and dates, which Michael efficiently resolved with no complications.  Thankfully, nothing cast a shadow on a perfect summer stay.
Thanks Crew!
P.S.  Ask Zee for tips on hiking and biking trails in the area.<//text>

Sitting at the top of the Bluffs at Dog Beach, OceanAire Apartments gives us an amazing sunset every evening.  A glass of wine on our patio, watching the whales and other wildlife frolic in the waves, is one of the daily pleasures our oceanfront home offers us.

Great staff and friendly neighbors makes it easy to love this community.</Review>

<Text>I moved in towards end of 2017 and Mike, Marisol, & Veronica have been great. They really try to accommodate every request and are not rigid when it comes to maintaining rules.

If only the maintenance person who updates tickets were as accommodating. They tend to hurry past requests without thinking of the tenant.< /Text>< date>

<text>My significant other and I have been viewing and touring apartments around the Peninsula and San Francisco. We scheduled a tour to view this amazing property because of the proximity to the beach and the ocean views.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by Zee, the assistant manager. She was friendly, upbeat and gave us a thorough tour. She discussed what future events and improvements they're planning to do and you can hear how much she truly cares about making the experience at OceanAire better. By far, she is the only person we've had a tour with that has made us feel right at home.

Thank you so much Zee! We both thoroughly enjoyed our tour of OceanAire apartments and absolutely can not wait to move in!< /text>< user_id>

Hello about 4 months ago I was literally kicked out of the spa while using it with a friend, since the spa never worked is always under maintenance, but now answer me what kind of maintenance is this that lasts months and months?  the worst management i have ever had the displeasure to deal with, this is misleading advertising, show on the website that the spa is one of the things the condo offers however this is not true i want to know what day the spa will definitely be open to  residents or I will seek my rights, we do not pay so expensive to be injured</Review>

I visited this property while relocating from Houston. The view is amazing and the property is small and intimate. Zee was so friendly and professional. She helped make me less anxious about my big move by talking to me on a personal level. I decided to go with something less expensive, but this place is definitely still on my radar.<//review>

I've been at OceanAire longer than most; four years in November. Over the years the community has had its ups & downs - most noticeably when it underwent major construction for about a year (which drove many of the negative reviews online). They've made some great positive changes since then, most notably in management of the community. This remains a really nice place to live - quiet, comfortable, and with an ideal location right on the ocean. The staff are terrific. They are highly responsive and the maintenance team is the best (particular shoutouts to Mike, Zee, and Omar).
With that said, lately I've been disappointed with the amenities that OceanAire promotes front & center on their website as a value-add to residents. That lovely spa that you see on the home page? Hasn't worked for months; basically all summer. The fitness center? Machines are frequently broken or not properly maintained, and bizarrely there is a personal trainer running her business out of it all day which monopolizes the equipment. Be careful investing too much value in the beach access, because this part of the coastline experiences major erosion, which means restoration efforts need to happen which block or disrupt that access. (The access was closed for over a year when a sinkhole took out a chunk of the path, and as of the time of writing this review the beach is a major construction site due to a necessary rebuild of the seawall.)
Overall, I still recommend OceanAire to prospective tenants, but please make your decision based solely on the apartment itself, and not in the peripheral amenities which have become unreliable and consequently far less valuable.</Text>

There is no wheelchair accessible route to the office. The whole property is on a hill, and finding paths that don't have stairs is a challenge. Wooden hand rails are regularly covered in mist and sand due to proximity to the coast. This makes them gross to touch and hard to grip. Thicker boards are often used instead of a pole that's easy to get a grip on.</Review>

I LOVE my living experience at Oceanaire! The apts are perfectly located within walking distance to the beach, brewery, market and places to eat. The apartments are REALLY nice and I love that the ocean sounds lulls me to sleep. The grounds are very well maintained and everyone including my neighbors are so friendly! Marisol, my leasing consultant, is the best! She made sure my husband and I got the apt we wanted and made our move in so easy. She’s always available for any questions and very pleasant to work with.</text>

< Review>
I have lived in one of their corporate apartments for about 3 months.  I have enjoyed my stay here.  My one bedroom apartment interior is nice and spacious for an older apartment.  Currently, the complex is undergoing a much needed major exterior renovation.  I believe once completed, the building exterior will look very nice.   Just be aware, if you visit right now, be prepared for major construction side effects (dust, mold, glass insulation, trash and noise).    This complex has the potential to be very nice within the next 6 months.   Current state, I would rate 2 stars.</Review>

A lot of unreasonable charges, even after we move out for 10 days. I will still pay for the charges because I have no time to deal with you guys, but for all those people who are looking for apartments to rent, I suggest you that do NOT even think about this place. If you guys still choose to live here, good luck.< /review>

The walls are paper thin, which they know about about don't seem to care about, and the office is unwilling to work with good tenants who pay the rent on time and don't bother anyone when they complain about the family of 4 living in a single bedroom upstairs that makes noise around the clock. Do not live here. It may look nice, but the actual experience of living here is intolerable. It also no longer has beach access.</text>

I wish the management were more proactive to address noise issues, again middle of the day on a weekend and the upstairs neighbor is blasting music, contacted the office by email and called but the answer is they can't contact the tenant at the moment and the patrol service paid my each tenant don't start to work until 7 and all I get is "sorry for the inconvenience" and the community website doesn't have the noise complaint option anymore</text>

<rating>1<//rating><time>1508949983756<//time><pics>None< /pics><Text>I've lived here for 2+ years and used to sing praises of the place. I was told that the same management company was kept on after the property was sold and renamed from LandsEnd to OceanAire. However, with all that's going on it's surprising how poorly everything is being handled. As a side note, the beach access - one of the reasons we chose to live here has not been fixed for almost a year now.

CONSTRUCTION: So far, it's been a very poor experience. There's dust, noise, and construction items everywhere. We were given 3 days notice to move all of our patio furniture off during construction with no place to put it all. We were told that, for our specific building, it would be worked on for 2 months and to "keep your curtains drawn to ensure privacy.  Crews will be working at the windows and on balconies with visual access to your home." It's odd that they wouldn't finish 1 building at a time. Much of the parking (including street parking) has been taken over by construction vehicles and building materials. Multiple times, they've also had people enter our apartment for cabling related to the construction. We are given notice, but in reality, what choice do we have if we are not home and prefer that people do not enter? Today is supposed to be the final day of construction; however, the painting is still in progress. It's not going to complete within the deadline they've informed us of.

OFFICE MANAGEMENT: They will make no reasonable accommodations for any of the inconveniences, have no power to do so, and will not point you to people that can help. Our rent continues to increase. Our keys do not work for community shared spaces, and we were told by other apartment renters that we have to get our keys reprogrammed. There's a couple of stoic and rude office staff (with an exception or 2). You eventually give up since it's uncomfortable to list concerns to people that don't care and cannot help.

We still currently live in the complex due to the community of friends that have moved here with us. All 8 of which, not surprisingly, have had their own unhappy apartment issues. My hope is that the management company or owners really take into account what our community members are saying and make an effort to reasonably accommodate for issues. Currently, it just feels like existing apartment renters are being punished for staying here, try to voice concerns, but are faced with stoicism and an "unfortunately, it is what it is" attitude.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Before it changed its name and owner, this place was called Land's End Apartment Homes. Back then, it was a great place to live under the management of Joe and Shelley. After they left, the management team kept changing every few months. I even stopped by the office today and learned the team has been overhauled again(4th time in 6 months). Needless to say, this high turnover rate has made getting anything done impossible. Communication has been terrible as well. The bigger issue may be that they found a sinkhole 100 feet from the property, making it dangerous and blocking access to the beach, which is the essentially the best amenity at this place. With all these unexpected and unpleasant changes, I made the decision to move out.
After reading some of the other reviews, I'm noticing people are saying that the walls and floors are really thin here. Having lived only on the top floor units, I can't really relate to that. One thing that does get loud are the in-unit laundry machines. They are incredibly loud.

UPDATE(11/01/2017): I just read the response from the owner and the suggestion that they "have been in constant communication" with me is not authentic. I was never contacted about it. Ultimately, I posted my review after I moved out so there was nothing to be done. That said, I have been told that there is a new management team and new updates to the units taking place, so I can't speak for current state of the apartments here.

UPDATE(03/01/2018): I have been contacted by a number of current residents asking if I'd be willing to provide information on incidents where the management was dishonest about the state of apartments and facilities, possibly to take action legally. It seems even the current residents are experiencing lingering issues with the management team. Disappointed to hear that things have continued to deteriorate at this place.</Review>< Pics>

It would be zero stars if it wasn’t for the amazing location. Before moving in, we were assured by management that the construction in our area was complete. As a night shift nurse, this was important to me. Unfortunately they lied. As I tried to sleep during the day, I would be awakened by loud banging literally on the other side of my bedroom wall. I reached out to management multiple times without response, including my mention that my patient’s lives were in my hands and it was dangerous that I wasn’t sleeping. They refused to work with me in any way. The building itself is poorly constructed. For example, I couldn’t be blow drying my hair in the bathroom and using the toaster in the kitchen at the same time without all of the power in the apartment going out. We had mice despite paying for pest control. The garage that I parked in had a door that rarely worked. I could really go on and on about the issues we had in the short 7 months that we lived there. Definitely wouldn’t recommend this complex for anything long term as the cliff is eroding quickly and it is pretty clear these apartments will be in the ocean in the next few years. Last thing- they reached out to us constantly trying to get positive google reviews. I have a feeling that many of these 5 Star reviews may have been incentivized.< /text>

<Text>Lands End is an amazing place to live!  We lived there for about 9 months and had to move for a job out of state.  The view is unbelievable and nearly all year round you can see whales, dolphins, sea lions, pelicans & more right from your apartment!  The only issues we had were that the garbage disposal broke, the fridge was shutting off and on & the dryer wasn't drying very well, but they resolved all of the issues quickly.  Some reviews complained about the washer/dryer combination machine not drying well, but the filter has to be cleaned every few months, so simply put in a work order and the dryer will work great after being cleaned.  The complex itself is a little older and we can often hear our neighbors upstairs, but we would definitely continue to live here if we were staying in Pacifica.  It is clean, safe and very peaceful.  It is very close to Safeway, good restaurants and Hwy 1.  It was also nice to have a gym, jacuzzi & clubhouse that I could walk to in less than a minute.  The price for the SF Bay Area is reasonable; you will pay about what you'd pay in many other apt. complexes in the area but this one is right on the ocean!  But nothing's perfect...you will not get all of your security deposit back; you will have to pay for carpet shampooing, repainting, apartment cleaning, etc. when you move out.< /Text>< time>

<text>The good:
1) The location is absolutely incredible. We saw whales, seals and dolphins frequently and got to go down to the beach every day. My fiancé and I as well as our dog loved that very much. Pacifica is such an awesome town in the bay that isn’t too far from the city.
2) Office staff is friendly.

The bad: phew...here it goes...
1) They will squeeze every penny out of your security deposit possible. There was one ding in our wall, about 3/4 inch in diameter and we got charged $150 for painting. We also spent the entire day cleaning and shampooing the carpets before we moved. The place looked pristine, yet we still got hit with a $150 charge for apartment cleaning and $95 for carpet cleaning. I’m sure Trinity will respond with a justification for this, however it was an unethical move regardless...as our apartment was beyond acceptable for the next resident’s move in.
2) Mice! You’ll be charged monthly for pest control, yet the pests are far from controlled around Oceanaire. We saw mice as well as their feces in and around our apartment frequently.
3) Very long response times to maintenance requests. Expect about a week min to get something scheduled (not completed, scheduled). I also informed the office about a cable being broken on the smith machine in the community gym. They did nothing for 3 weeks, then their next action was to put an out of order sign on it that says “we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused” rather than fixing the broken equipment. I’d estimate that 50-75% of the emails that come from the office end with that same note...”we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused” rather than addressing the root cause of the issues on hand. Proactive VS reactive management. Last, the emergency maintenance line was non-functioning both times I needed it which was brought to management’s attention. I am not sure if that has been resolved, but it doesn’t change the fact that it happened.
4) Electricity issues. If you use two things simultaneously that draw a lot of power, expect a short. We couldn’t use the following things at the same time: microwave, hairdryer, toaster, washer/dryer. Simply very old electrical wiring throughout property.
5) Many of the apartments will likely be at the bottom of the cliff within the next 5 years, less if the impending earthquake hits. The sea cliff erosion at this location is a real threat.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1536707689881, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with us.

<rating>1<//rating><review>I've lived here for 3 years now, and brought 3 new tenants in. This place used to be A GEM (when it was LandsEnd). Since it has become Oceanaire, it is AWFUL. The staff is incredibly rude and unhelpful. Last week they just up and changed the key for the parking garage while I was at work, leaving a taped note on the door to come by the office to get a new key...no email, no new key in my mailbox...I got home after the office closed, so it was incredibly inconvenient! I was locked out and unable to get to my car in the morning, sitting outside with my 2 kids, until someone else finally let us in. There is construction going on 24/7, no break in the rent price. If you are looking in Pacifica, DO NOT MOVE HERE. It is the absolute worst.<//review><Date>1508450639958< /Date><gmapID>0x808f7b754356e2c1:0xfb38a4865087515a</gmapID>< username>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is very comforting, you enjoy tranquility, the cold weather most of the time, it is unique, you meditate, you exercise with yourself (or), you enjoy the surroundings and especially the sea.

(Original)
Es muy reconfortante, gozas de  tranquilidad, el clima frío la mayoría del tiempo, es  único, meditas, ejercitas estás contigo misma(o),disfrutas los alrededores y sobre todo del mar.<//Review>< Pics>

7 courses of beef were glorious; carpatio, beef salad, grilled beef slices/sausage/patty, steamed pate and then ginger heavy congee. The sides really sealed the meal, providing an infinite array of herbs, leaves and this anchovy pineapple salsa that improved every mouthful it accompanied.

Also ordered the bahn xeo since the world does not comprise of cow alone; again a bed of fragrant herbs and a tasty fresh crepe stuffed with pork/shrimp/sprouts< /review>

<review>Last came here over 8 years ago for the 7 courses of fish.  Came back for 7 courses of beef and it did not disappoint.  They have improved the interior.  Portions appear to be larger than the same branch in Milpitas.<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This was the second time that I have used them for my car.
The 1st time I came in I needed and oil change and they did it so quickly and a reasonable price!
The 2nd time, I had a text from Jan reminding me I would need my brakes done. Low and behold I DEFINITELY did! So I went in and before I came I already knew about how much I was paying for and they were quick to source my parts. Which can be had sometimes since my Mitsubishi Mirage can be hard to find parts sometimes. They kept their promise and got the job done and BETTER YET it was a slightly lower price than what I had expected. The staff is super fair, communicative, and professional. So happy I had found this location.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
Great Workers. AAA Auto repair center. Knowledge. Quick but through. Great place to service your vehicle. Staff was clear communicative and direct.

Went on a camping trip and ended up needing service repair. This center took great care of my partner and I during a stressful situation. Being AAA members we received a great price for the work and labor done.
Would recommend this spot to anyone who truly needs car care.

Shot out to Brit who was supper helpful, professional, and supportive during visit. Daniel was also very professional and gave great service.

Special thanks to this Team for Servicing my car allowing me to get back home safe and sound with no complications.</review>

<Review>I came in for a vehicle inspection which is required by my employer. The first time I was in, I failed, but they kindly explained that my rear tires were old with cracked sidewalls. They told me there was no charge for a failure, and when I got my new rear tires installed, they would be able to give my car a passing grade. I was back within a week with my new tires and this time it passed. Great crew there and friendly too.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1619185673583, 'text': "We love to hear about experiences like yours, Christopher.

Over 6 years progressively I got worsened customer service. Other customers complain on Yelp of shoddy work and shifty pricing structure. They cost me in excess of $500 plus interest for misdiagnosis and I used up all of my insurance roadside assists so I now pay out of pocket til renewal due to misdiagnosis of battery issue. A two-yr old 10,000 mile battery that it turns out was simply drained by the amp system of the radio.. Constant turnover of mechanics and new service Mgr is undiplomatic and money-conscious.The owner seems to let him run the show.  Get the sense they were going under and had to make ends meet. Old disreputable environment and hardly any room to park. This last time around, after owner scheduled me for appt to repair flat tire,  I drove there on the damaged tire, waited almost 1 hr.  only to be told guys wouldn't work on my car b/c I' d been "rude"to them before. Do they wonder why? Owner should've guaranteed appt. and told them to do work then terminate services. I expect honest evaluation, competence and consistent fair pricing commensurate with value not competitive. Difficult customers reward the most when work is good. Avoid them and go across the street to Tire Pros. who fixed the tire for free! VERY DISPLEASED WITH MEINEKE. But I thank them for saving me and my car further wear and tear.< /Text>

This is the first time I've used Meineke, and I was seriously impressed. I went there to get my brakes and rotors replaced, the last time I serviced my brakes was eons ago. After they did their free brake inspection, I learned that the rotors had some minor wear and tear but no action needed to be taken at that point. Other places would have tried to up-sell as much as possible by exaggerating the brake wear, but instead they gave me an honest inspection report. When the brakes do need service, I'll definitely be using Meineke.<//text>

Frequently,  there is an unevenness in check in service.  Usually the waiting area is cramped and sad. You go outside and the beautiful garden is neglected.

I’m a female.  AKA “cisgender”. And I appreciate seeing care in a customer waiting area, even in a  man-cave style garage< /text>

Took them 6 hours to figure out I needed a new fuel pump. Never called the entire day to inform us or give us a quote. Then calls us the next day to tell us the car should be done by 4. We drove 2 hrs. Sat in Santa Barbara from 12- 6 pm and was then told the car was not ready. We had to drive another 2 hours back home. There was only one guy working on 6 cars.
It was ridiculous. I am beyond mad. I still do not have my car!

I had a great experience. I called ahead of time to schedule a brake diagnostics. I made the appointment with Jan and Britney checked in y car the day of. They discovered that my fuel line was leaking so they told me I needed to take care of this right away. They gave me a ride home while they started repairs on my vehicle. They called me back with a quote to repair my car. I asked them that I needed time to figure out what I would do. I called back later and spoke with Jan who shared with me that my AAA MEMBERSHIP allowed for a discount and she suggested to apply for the credit option where I would get a rebate if I applied to use that as well. I gave Jan the go ahead to begin repairs and she estimated that my car would be ready in a few days. I called back a few days later to check on the progress and they helped me to get my car sooner than the initial estimate. When I came to pick up my repaired car, Jan made sure to sign me up for Meineke’s rewards program! I was so happy with the customer service and look forward to the next time I need to have repairs on my vehicle.</review>

surprised me with their thorough, honest diagnosis and  service. One thing that I would recommend, is to implement better COVID precautions— the billing/waiting room office is tiny (maybe 12x12 ft) and there were like 3 customers and 2 employees crammed in there at one time. I felt uncomfortable and I felt bad for the employees that have to stay in that room with mouth breathing customers like myself.

Nevertheless, it’s uncommon to find a quick auto repair shop (menike, jiffy lube, Firestone)  with employees that aren’t very experienced or trying to rip you off . the people at this Meineke are skilled at their trade and truly care about their customers and the work they do.</Review>

Scheduled an appointment to weld exhaust back to the muffler. Mechanic lost/forgot his welder. No courtesy call to let me know they couldn't do the work. Very inconsiderate and foul mouthed. -Took it to Economy muffler and they fixed it in 20 min for $80.00.</review>

I was teaching my son how to change the oil in the truck and he accidentally overfilled. I went straight to your shop located on State Street here in Santa Barbara. And the attendant could not have been nicer or more helpful. They not only drained the little bit of oil that was necessary, they also inflated my tires and vacuumed my truck at very little cost. This is quality , no doubt< /Review>

I was driving cross country and the emergency brake warning light would not turn off. I tried to get assistance from two other locations they could not help unless I took the car to a dealer. I  pulled into meineke they were so nice to my dog and myself as we waited. They corrected the problem and I made it home safe and sound with no worries or further issues. Thank you so much.</review>

<date>1590077655820<//date><rate>2</rate><Text>Earlier this month, I took my car in for an oil change and tire rotation. As part of this, the car gets an inspection. I was in and out, and was told that my car looked good, other than uneven wear on the front tires and my air filter needed to be changed. Fair enough, these were things I was already aware of. However, when I went out to my car, my tires were not rotated. I went back and asked why the tires weren't rotated, and I was told the front tires were too bald to be put in the back. Okay, that's fine, but I wasn't sure why this wasn't mentioned before I was given the keys. I went to get new tires the next day (at a different establishment), and was planning on replacing the two tires that were balding. However, I ended up needing to replace all 4 because there was a giant nail in one of the "good" tires! The mechanic said it looked like it had been in there awhile given how worn the nail head was. Considering I had been to Meineke the day before and they "inspected" my car-- including my tires-- I'm not sure how this was missed. It makes me question what else might have been overlooked on the inspection.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This location is one of their affiliates and we were told we’d get good service and a 10% discount for repairs there. They said we had a leak in our water pump hose, which needed to be replaced, and that it would be more affordable to buy an entire radiator kit rather than the hose parts separately, and it was necessary to have the whole thing flushed after, as well as replacing a worn serpentine belt. They estimated this would be $1558 after taxes, which was more than the car is worth. We got 2 second opinions who both agreed this wasn’t reasonable, and decided to take our car elsewhere. They charged $120, after the discount, for the diagnostic alone.

<Text>The great thing about Meineke Santa Barbara is its locally owned. Their staff is always friendly, polite and courteous. Eric was great at helping me get my car fixed and even showed me what was wrong with my car instead of just telling me what I needed. Jan was very personable and pleasant to work with when checking out. What I love about coming here is they actually know what they’re doing and I trust them with my car and that’s huge for me especially having to drive often long distances and putting the safety of my car in their hands takes the ease off my shoulders.< /Text>< Pictures>

Highly recommend AGAINST this establishment. For the lack of a better phrase, it would appear that the owners/mechanics aren't ethical about repairs and cost. They fabricate costly repairs and make it sound like it was the customer's fault all along. For instance, my car developed some cabin noise just after a regular servicing with them. I took it out to have it checked; they generously offered to look into it without any cost - so far so good. Less than 30 mins into the check-in, I get a call from their lead mechanic (Eric?) that the starter is broken and the car wouldn't start up and it would $800 to fix it. This startled me as the the car is relatively new and has had never shown any prior problems. This did not sound right at all - red flags all over it. A quick show at a local mechanic told me that someone messed with the battery to make it look like a starter issue - just to swindle money from customers. The local guy jump started the battery and it works perfectly now. DO NOT go to this service center.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Jan is VERY unprofessional, and after sharing my experience on social media, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My car broke down, I had it towed to meineke on upper state. I couldnt afford to fix it, so it was there for 11 days. I stayed in contact with her regarding my inability to move it. When I came to pay, she came out of the back room and yelled at me... speaking down to me in front of several other customers who looked shocked. She charged me $75, without telling me she would, to store the car for one additional day. If my car broke down, and I can't afford to fix it, 75 bucks is a big deal. Kick me while I'm down, no thank you.

One friend of mine, a senior citizen, spoke poorly of her saying 'she is horribly unorganized and hot tempered, and she cant seem to remember anything.'

Another friend said a mechanic there offered him $100 for his car, a 2016 scion... shady.

I certainly will never go back to this Meineke, and I encourage prospective customers to go somewhere else.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

(Something I very much needed at that time.). The job was done by 1:00;  I could pick up my car and be to work without being very late for my shift.

<review>The customer service at Meineke could be improved significantly. We had to wait 2 1/2 hours for oil change on two cars, even though we had an appointment. We expected to receive a call but after 2 hours of waiting, we decided to go back to the shop to check on the cars. It turned out the cars are ready but nobody called us. We had to wait another 20-30 mins at the shop until we could pay and get our cars.

The people there use old times tactics to persuade you to fix certain things on your car. One of the man there used the term "and now to the difficult car" referring to the issues they recommend fixing. Overall it is a painful experience having to wait long at their shop and having to decline all of their offers.

Another issue was that they did not rotate the tires of one of my cars, even though I explicitly requested so, due to the tires being "worn out too much". The front tires were worn much more than the rear ones and this is the reason I wanted them rotated. They declined rotation, thus making my car less safe then it could be if the tires were rotated.

And lastly, my steering wheel was too dirty with oil after the service. My hands got all the black dirt while I was driving home. I had to wipe it afterward.

Price is good, location is OK (a bit busy), but I will definitely look for another place for an oil change.</review><Rate>2< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x80e915254bfb7241:0xdf1f0ececffdff65</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>RIP OFF!! Got a new Serpentine Belt (I told them it could be the serpentine belt based on what I'd researched). They diagnosed my car and told me that I needed a new serpentine belt. Two months later same noise that I thought was the serpentine belt started up again. Took my car back to find that it wasn't the serpentine belt. According to them it's the alternator, belt tensioner assembly and idler pulley that's causing the noise. I DONT TRUST THEM AT ALL!! I said so did I really need a new serpentine belt? And my answer was,  "I'm not sure, but it was worn so we replaced it". Get a second opinion! These guys are filling quotas.<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>Needed a window repaired that had fallen off its track, and needed it done asap, as we were on a road trip. The SB Meineke crew were very fast and the price was fair, they fixed the window in about 2.5 hours ! . I would highly recommend them, they had lots of customers and it seemed like a place the locals go to ( just try to avoid using their public restroom, it's kind of gross....but what do you expect at a  auto repair place )< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I went here to fix the car light that had went out, and the mechanic displaced the light. When I was driving at night, the beam would project in different direction, I had to go back the next day to get fixed, only to find out that he also had not put back the cap that protects the wires from being deranged.

Every time I go back for oil change, they try to up sell with other stuff, trying to open up my car, but due to lack of attention to details I experienced the first time I wen there, I cannot allow them to touch any moving part of my car because I have a feeling they might be reckless with it and boom, I loose a tire on freeway!

<Review>The man handling the customer was not too great with computer so it delay my appointment more than 30 minutes and held up the rest of the people. While I understand he had difficulty, he was taking his frustration on the customers, not the best look for the business.< /Review></record>

<text>I went in for an oil change, which was quick and nice. However the inspection report shows that they are no different from those maintenance shops that are trying to rip you off. So basically the report says that my car is gonna fall apart: all four tires, air filter, spark plugs, serpentine belt, valve cover, ALL need to be replaced! There's also brake fluid, coolant, and power steering fluid ALL need to be replaced and flushed. Things like the belt, air filter, and tires are very easy to inspect so I don't know how can they tell me everything needs to be replaced when everything looks good. They also didn't do tire rotation because my tires were "too dangerous to put back on" LOL! The service was ok but I wouldn't believe a word on their inspection report.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

It seemed they were in the middle of training a new employee, which slowed things up a little.
However the desire to diagnose my brake problem and explain the repairs were spot on and the service was preformed in a timely manner with stellar results.
Thanks so much.😊</Review>

Even so, they got my info down and in 5 min they had scheduled me an appt for 2 hours later. They were ready for me when I showed up 10 minutes early to my appt, got me an estimate very quickly, and were able to show me exactly what was wrong so I knew it was a legitimate problem before spending to fix it. I called my old mechanic in Reno to confirm their estimate and he agreed he wouldn't do that work for any cheaper, I was getting a great price. Meineke completed the work in about the projected time, and had my car back on the road same day, despite their shop  lathe being broken and needing to resurface my rotors at another shop. I believe it was Adam who helped me out. He was there from when I came in at 9a til I left with my car at 6p, and didn't seem like he was leaving til he finished up his work. He was hustling around, making it happen the entire time I was there, an excellent employee. Will definitely be returning to this location for all my car servicing needs.<//text>< pics>

Wish I had checked the reviews. I will never go back.

Summary:
1) Overcharged.
2)Told I had emergency brake work, and my car was unsafe to drive when it wasn’t, offered overpriced repairs.
3) Car began leaking oil after service, and at next oil change at dealership I was informed the oil plug was stripped, $100 bandaid, $600+ to fix/replace.
4) Meineke Customer Service unresponsive

1)	Overcharged: Charged an additional $10 for oil filter, when price on the desk where I was paying said it was included.

2)	When they called to tell me my oil change was done, I was informed that I needed new brake pads and roters, that they were “metal on metal” and that the car would be dangerous to continue driving without immediate replacement, the quote to replace was between $700-$800. I called around and found many shops offered the service for $100-$200 less. When I took my car into Big Brand Tires for an inspection/second opinion, they informed me that it was not metal on metal, or an immediate safety concern. I did not need new rotors. I was at the “manufacturers recommended time for replacement”.

3)	My car began leaking oil after my oil change service. At my next service at the dealership, they informed me that my oil plug had been stripped. This was going to cost ____ to replace the oil pan (I got several quotes from repair shops). They were able to use a “time-cert” plug to bandaid the problem, with no guarantee for $100. I researched online. An oil plug should last the life of the vehicle. It is damaged by overtightening. This can easily be avoided by using proper mechanic tools.

4)	I contacted Meineke Customer Service to request Meineke pay for the cost of the repair. It took several weeks before I received a response. Once I received the response, I was asked to submit more paperwork substantiating my claim. I submitted the paperwork and never heard back. I resent the paperwork and contacted them at least 2 more times with no response.

As a result I am leaving this negative review to inform other consumers.</Text>

I'm an Uber driver, so the state of my ride is of paramount importance! Well, as I was driving a passenger through rush hour traffic, the check engine light came on and my beloved Hyundai Elantra began to shake and tremble in a very alarming way. . The tremors were growing more intense by the minute; I nearly scheduled another driver to step in, but the lady in my backseat was a good sport, saying she didn't mind the turbulence. ("I was born and raised in California, earthquakes don't phase me!")
Reaching our destination, she kindly reassured me, but the comforting words fell flat against the look of grave concern on her face; I knew this was serious.
Distraught, I pulled into the Meineke here on  upper state and immediately felt better. The owner, Jan (awesome and very knowledgeable lady) had an estimate ready for me within a few minutes. A very thorough inspection was performed by the service manager, Adam, and he caught multiple issues which were missed during a recent inspection with another repair shop. In fact, the issue was very specific to my particular vehicle, and indicated Adam's expertise.
Came back the next day, Adam and Jan hooked me up with awesome discounts (meineke website is great for coupons), and my car is now running flawlessly for a very reasonable price. Thanks guys!<//Text>

<Review>To whom it may concern at Meineke customer service,

My first experience at Meineke car care went a little like this:

Four months ago I went down to the office and made an appointment for the following day at 8 AM to avoid the wait.  I showed up to my appointment five minutes early, did the paperwork needed and handed over my keys.

After about an hour, noticing that my truck was still in the shop, I went into the office to see how much more time it was going to take. At that time they announced to me that they had lost my keys, or miss placed them and that they were looking for them.

Long story short, 45 minutes later I was finally in my vehicle.

I chalked it up as human error, and went about my day.

Let me share with you my second experience with Meineke.

Are you going to get an oil change, sympathetic, package and the lady at the counter says “no problem, it’ll be ready in an hour“.  A $70 oil change, with one filter, was $128. A little alarming, but it’s when they told me that my door handle broke on my truck is when I started to get a little irritated.

I ordered a new door handle, and add the damages caused by Meineke‘s employees, my experience at Meinicke yesterday cost me $300.

I realize now, that is my last trip to Meinicke for any services on my vehicle and a heads up to anyone planning on having their vehicle serviced at Meinicke to give it some extra thought  before you invest your money in a company with no customer care.

And so that’s that.

I went in for an oil change and a look over, the Service Reps were really nice.  I asked them to check out the wheel bearings specifically since I took my Mercedes E350 Coupe in to have a couple fog light bulbs replaced months before to a mechanic shop downtown and they wrote up a list of things that needed to be replaced and the wheel bearings was one of the items.  It turns out that my wheel bearings are fine.  They did say I needed new rear tires which was one of the items on the list.  I felt that they were professional and honest<//Review>

Like others have said, ignore older reviews; I started coming here because the previous owner was excellent, but my experience with the new ownership was poor.

I brought my car in for an oil change, which they predicted would take 40 min. Two hours later I returned- my car had been finished for an hour, but they forgot to call me.

The woman at the counter did a really poor job explaining issues with my car. Nothing against her- she was nice enough- but I have a limited knowledge of cars. That's why I go to a mechanic! You've got to have someone behind the counter who can explain what is going on.

At the end of her list was a suggestion for three new tires. She asked if I would like the tires today. I said, "no, I'll wait on the tires". So she handed me my bill without addressing any of the other issues. I guess I'll get them taken care of somewhere else.

Not the worst experience, but really unprofessional in several ways. I will not be trusting them with my car in the future.< /text>

I recommend this place to everyone! My experience with them showed me they care about their customers and take responsibility, too.

So yes, a mistake was made, and an oil change went wrong leading to all the oil leaking out and leaving the engine completely shot. But not only did they completely take care of everything - towing my car back, a replacement car while mine was out of commission, and a replacement engine installed for no charge at all, they did it in a friendly way, apologizing for what happened and totally accommodating my schedule and needs. Even a month later, they are helping out and fixing small things relating to the new engine for free.

I have gone here for oil changes for two years, and in general, I have never felt pushed by these guys to buy anything. They're happy to tell you what is urgent and what isn't, and just generally have been a pleasure to deal with.

It might be me, but I just haven't heard a mechanic ever say 'oh that was our fault, sorry, let me fix that for you at no cost'. Awesome, hat tip to Thomas for the excellent service.<//text>

Turns out they striped the threads to the drain plug and to seal it they put in an over sized plug, not my original factory plug, and sealed it with silicone to stop the leak. They never told me this and when I found out they would take zero responsibility and tried to blame me some how. Their liars and cheats. Go any where else but here.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I was going to Meineke because they had a 20 dollar oil changed coupon. I set an appointment and when I arrived they told me that they were a little bit behind schedule. So I waited, and an hour and a half later my car was still not ready nor pulled up to start a change. Once I told them that I had made an appointment so I wouldn't be waiting they told me my car would be next. Then I asked how long it would take for them to change my oil and they said around an hour to hour an a half. No one wants to wait at a shop for 3 hours. I know it doesn't take over an hour to change the oil. I needed up wasting my time and gas on something that never ended up happening. Lastly the main guy behind the counter was rude. In the end I would never recommend someone going there. Service was awful!!!< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I had taken my car in before and would've given them good reviews, until this incident: They stripped the oil pan screw like they did with another person who's review is below. If this had been all, I would've given them a rating of three stars, but it wasn't.

First, it is very easy to make it so that stripping a screw will never happen, and that is car mechanics 1: put it in by hand, then only tighten it when it's in with the socket. They did not do this.

However this was not the major problem: after stripping the screw, and taking approximately four hours to try to repair it, they did not tell me about it, even though I saw them working on it, and caulking it in place like they did the person below! Naturally, oil leaked like crazy. It ruined a large spot in my driveway, which couldn't be corrected by cleaning then coating the driveway. The oil light came on and luckily I saw it and added 4 quarts of oil. It all leaked out also. Luckily I saw this before it ruined the engine, which I am sure they would have happily charged me to work on.

Naturally they charged me for the work that they allegedly did. However, the fact that they did not tell me that there was an issue and tried to sneak it by, says that they will do anything including lie for money: will they tell you that you need services that you don't need for money? YES. Will they lie and say that they did something that they did not for money? YES.  I would have to assume the answer to these is yes, which is why I only give them one star. I photographed the driveway (which is still a mess), and took my car in elsewhere, and had them put it on the lift with me there. They immediately identified the problem and showed me the dripping oil. They showed me that the oil screw had been caulked in place. As I know that I saw them doing this, and as they had done the three prior oil changes there was no question who did it. Their unwillingness to tell me about it because of the cost to them to repair it is insulting.

As I documented everything, I was thinking of suing, as the cost to me to replace the oil pan, and re-recoat the driveway will certainly be more than $750.  However, frankly I do not want to see them again.

The interesting thing is that the day I was in there there was another person being told about his 3rd or 4th(!) oil leak on the same car.  All I could do is wonder after this occurred to me if there really was an oil leak, or if it was just them making money of these people like they did off me.  Check out the persons review below (1 star) where the same thing happened to him in the same way.  Well I learned at a cost of $750!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1501621954035, 'text': "We're worried by this account, Patrick, as this doesn't depict our standard for honest and reliable service.

I'd give no stars if I was able to, I came in at 9am took 2 hrs for an oil change, currently there is a coupon for Father's day , it's is labeled as 45th Anniversary 45% off for premium oil changes. I was written by Jad, Jad told me at the check out that the corporate coupon was not acceptable and that I could only use AAA 5% or axxis 10% off her words were " if you use that coupon it would cost more for parts / fluid than what you would pay, it would be like buying my customers, it is going to attract the wrong community" - what ever that last part ment ... I only came here because I needed a last min oil change before business trip I was recommended by coworkers and when i called Meineke said I could come in 10min. Sorry Meineke, you lost a customer, I cannot recommend you and will advise my fellow co-workers of this experience, overall the establishment is very unprofessional... Corporate has been contacted and my statement has been given.<//Review>

<review>WARNING THESE PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT THE HECK THEY ARE DOING!!!

I went in for an easy trans mission fill because i had warning lights on my dash saying it was low. I took it to my mechanic and he told me it is low about 15% but my mechanic didnt have the fluid to do it so i took it to Meineke here in santa barbara for  the fill.

The car i own is a BMW 525I. Everyone who is a professional mechanic knows you have to go from under the car while the engine is running to fill the transmission fluid up. THIS GUY Went under my car pulled the plug  transmission fill plug out and used a pump to fill it. However The failure to this poor uneducated man put 10 drops of the Fluid in and saw the fluid coming back out. He then plugged up the transmission and dropped my car and said it didn't need any fluid that it was full.

I tried to stop him to tell him your doing it wrong. But he insisted on saying it was full. He told the desk clerk to charge me 35$ for the fill.

I left and I will never come back to this IDIOT OF A PLACE EVER

I hope the Meineke Higher ups see the idiocy of this Branch and RE EVALUATES ITS EMPLOYEES.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>THIS SHOP IS TERRIBLE! Brought my car in for engine misfire, got $400 of service (tune-up) done that supposedly "fixed" the problem. 1 week later brought the car in for the same exact issue, paid another $300 for the original problem to be fixed again (shouldn't that work have been on them!?!) meanwhile, asked them to fix front headlamp that was out….NEVER REPLACED both times. Included in a tune-up should be all vital fluids checked, if not topped off….less than a month after the service when i was back in the bay for my break, my car overheated…when taken into a different shop back home, they told me that my coolant reservoir had NO ANTIFREEZE (just a little bit of water) but NO LEAK. therefore in the tune-up meineke did, my fluids were never checked, leaving my coolant resorovir completely empty, for me to overheat on a 300 mile drive back home. when i went back to this meineke and told them about the issues i had, they did not compensate me whatsoever. they proceeded to say the tune ups they do are not 'complete tune ups'.  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//Text>< GmapID>

Cherish is a top notch bartender.  Really personable and a good worker.  She was talking with a guest next to me about dental surgery she needs.  I would recommend the Clarion and Shooters do everything they can to help her out!!</review>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>The bar usually has a relaxed vibe. I wasn't drinking and a group of 3 women were starting stuff with me, making snarky comments, dancing like they thought they were cute and just threatened by my existence. I didn't look at them wrong, say anything to them, they were just like Cinderella's ugly step sisters. The only issue I've ever had there. I just left.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>The rooms need a little updating, such as, more power outlets  and a newer A/C system.  Other then that there's a lot to like. The bar and restaurant are nice and the inside pool is classical.  The price is right so I'll stay here again in the future.</Review><resp>None<//resp><Time>1440123182340<//Time></record>

Alexander Valley Healthcare, wow, it is so nice to know that Kevin Garvin, DDS is still available in Clovetdale.  Different surroundings but great staff, and their even on line with Goggle Review.  The whole crew is very friendly and welcoming.  Who could ask for any better Dental Care all right here in Cloverdale at Third and the Boulivard.  Ken F.</review>

I have been pleasantly surprised by every aspect of the Alexander valley clinic. From the front desk and phone staff to the medical assistants and nurses and my wonderful physician, Dr.Wheeler, everyone is professional, attentive, responsive and available. having had some frustrating experiences with the medical world of late I have been greatly relieved and helped in my first several visits. It's special to have physicians who also practice osteopathy and do Hands-On manipulation (OMT). Dr Wheeler is patient, compassionate, personable and highly professional. I feel fortunate to have found her!< /review>

This week I pulled a tick off my arm and it turned bright red and start to swell. I called Alexander Valley Healthcare and they said there were no appointments left that day, but come down and a nurse would take a look at me. Long story short, I checked in, saw the nurse, saw a Dr. in less than an hour. Got a prescription for some antibiotics. The nurse was great, the Dr. was great, they are my new healthcare provider.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>as we camped in Cloverdale at the Russian River this place was recommended by one if the locals.  Even though we were from out if town and didn’t have an appointment, we were seen within the hour and out in 1/2 an hour. The staff were very friendly and efficient. From reception to Check out it went very smoothly. A prescription was emailed over and we had my medication within 10 minutes at a locally owned pharmacy. Thank you AVHC for taking such good care of us.<//review><user_name>Linda Helling< /user_name>< userid>

Most doctors offices and/or health care clinics would've turned me away or told me to come back when I had coverage, but not Alexander Valley. I was able to make an appointment with their financial services department THAT DAY and they took care of all my paperwork and forms for my new health care plan. All I did was sign a couple of papers and they did the rest.  So the reason for my visit was I had ran out of my medication that I was prescribed by my private practice doctor(he closed his practice and retired, thus the reason why I was coming back to Alexander Valley) and I let them know my situation and I was able to see someone the next day and get my prescription filled even though my health care plan was still being authorized by the county. Thank You Alexander Valley HealthCare for taking care of me and thank you for doing it in such a timely manner! Never leaving you guys ever again!</text></record></dataset><record>

Staff were very friendly and professional. I needed a new healthcare provider and was reluctant as I had been with the same person for many years. I was so relieved when I met the medical staff. They were knowledgeable about my medical needs and I left feeling so pleased. I would recommend this group for my family or friends.< /Text>

I was visiting family in Cloverdale and had been miserable with Viral Bronchitis for almost a week. I called Alexander Valley Health and I was able to see a doctor that very same day, (which was surprising since Cloverdale had just gotten its power back on due to the Kincade Fires). The staff and Dr Elizabeth Pile were wonderfully kind and helpful - Dr Pile listened to and answered all my concerns, and was so easy to talk to. I will definitely go there if needed on future family visits!!</Text>

<review>The staff are very friendly and professional. They make you feel like you are special, not just a number like other dental offices I have been to. I would recommend them to anyone who has dental needs. I can't wait until my next visit. I give them 5 stars!!!<//review></record>

Sometimes it can wait, sometimes it will be a trip to the ER. It's great to have quality care here in Cloverdale, and not have to drive 15 or 30 miles to be seen.

<review>Very good experience. Pleasant staff, no suffocating crowds, friendly attentive staff gives this place a small town charm ive not experienced before. My doc, Doc Hashem, is competent, nice guy, easy to talk-to, made me feel right at home. He dealt with my issues quickly and without the typical redtape bureaucracy. (Painless medical care! Pun intended). They followed up with me by phone afterwards to assure i knew what/where&who i was to see next. Hell, put his face on money!< /review><rating>5< /rating><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

I had problems with seagulls making my roof a gathering place.
I called Advanced Wildlife Removal and they came by gave me an estimate and did the job promptly.  Mike was very knowledgeable and professional.  I just recommended them to my neighbor who called and asked who had done the amazing job she could see from her home.< /review>

The trap and removal was great but they offered to help “close the perimeter” of our backyard so we wouldn’t get another skunk. The tech Shad said he would fill in a hole in our block wall with rebar “so it would be really sturdy.” and put mesh under our vinyl fence where wildlife had been digging to get into our yard.

He didn’t do the wall the way he’d told us he would. No rebar. Just filled in the cracks around stacked cement blocks. Then left without putting mesh in the dirt. I requested multiple times for him to come back. About a week later, he came back, put mesh in the wrong place and left without saying anything.

See attached photo of our new vinyl fence with mesh . He told me that the animals couldn’t get through this gap because of the cement so I’m not sure why he thought this was an option. And he left the area where they we’re actually digging alone.

It seems like they have a lot of other good reviews. And I’ll say that the wildlife removal was fine. The costs were very clear. But the handyman work wasn’t great and I’m frustrated that my gate is ruined for nothing.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI3KqqZau7zvOEeTx4817NW7altgZvV0ztWyj7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA4UapNTNgoaFuSsAhs1dhTczyZstDySbbtihI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkZNusMdF61lxTVUBt7E8b_i7iNXZl_Jhvj7g_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dcd987cbc28eb3:0x109f05f1f8e5ce51< /gmapID></record>

Our house became a home to a large number of bats. These are far more than a nuisance as their droppings are extremely toxic. Advanced Wildlife Removal provided a reasonable quote and scheduled a removal plan for the very next day. Their process was effective and their work was professional. I was most impressed with their customer care from quote, to removal, to verification. They removed a problem for us with great ease and full satisfaction.</Review>

Called late on a Monday due to a wildlife issue and they came out the very next day. Their tech Izick was friendly, conscientious, knowledgeable, and professional. He answered all my many questions and held back a bunch of branches with his body so I could see where the skunks were digging under my back fence, which was very thoughtful.

On top of that, the price was better than other companies quoted me. I would absolutely recommend Advanced Wildlife Removal to anyone.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Frank and team helped us "snake-proof" our property, as neighbors have had issues with snakes in their yards.

I can honestly say they went above and beyond in every aspect. Clear communication, beyond fair pricing, and just a fantastic thorough job.

Hire them! I used Advanced Wild Life Solutions for rodent removal and exclusion at a new home I purchased. I received a quote from another company that was way over charging. Frankie from Advanced Wild Life gave me a fair price and did an excellent job. He arrived on time and was very professional and knowledgeable. He comes by and does check ups to ensure the quality of his work. I haven’t had a rodent since :)!!< /text>

<Review>Frank and Mike brought their expertise to a problem at our home, which included prevention and sealing our home from rodents, the service has continued to stop the problem .  Additionally Frank took preventative measures to stop rattlesnakes from entering the property. They were very aware of our pets as well.   Overall a great experience with a professional company.< /Review>< Time>

This was very important to us as we have an 11 month old and wanted to get rid of the mice as quick as possible. Shad Davies came out to inspect and he was very knowledgeable in what he does and gave us really great advice to keep the rodents away for good.

Very professional and  easy to work with.
At our place of business, they caught a skunk that was living under our office building. Thankfully the skunk did not spray in the trapping process. They brought the skunk to a field around the corner an let him/her find a new home. They proceeded to build a closure for the skunks entry point. This company is great! I would highly recommend!<//Review>

< Review>
I work for Anaheim Union High School District and directly communicate with Advanced Wildlife Removal on jobs at our 20 campuses.  We have been utilizing AWR for 4 years now and we couldn't be happier with the service.  Scheduling is easy, they arive on time, and every tech I've worked with has been not only very knowledgeable but also very aware and accommodating to our needs as a school district.  I personally couldn't recommend them enough.

<text>Their technician Francisco arrived a little late but had texted me in advance to let me know that he was stuck in traffic and coming from far away. He was friendly and professional and quickly inspected my attic and exterior of my home to look for any entry points for pests to enter. There are definitely squirrels or something of the like living in my attic. Francisco was able to finish the inspection and let the company know what was going on so they can send someone out to deal with it.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Advanced Wildlife Removal was great to work us in based on an already busy schedule of appointments.  Great attitudes and friendly service. Quickly removed the wildlife from the premises.  Definitely use them if you are experiencing similar Wildlife issues.< /Text>

Timely, professional, and great value! I didn’t feel like they were going to price gouge me. They didn’t upsell me, just performed the services I asked for. Highly recommend!< /text>

I highly recommend Advanced Wildlife Removal.  Mike was on time, did a very thorough inspection, took pictures, found all the points of entry, quoted a very good price, and because I need to sell the house quickly, got me into the schedule this week.  Mike was courteous and professional.  It is important to me that no critters be killed, so he is setting no-kill traps. Not all companies will do that for mice or rats, so I appreciate that they will.<//review>

This company is the best. Frank (owner) proposed a solution to raccoon problem that sounded perfect for me. I did not want to trap or kill anything. Shad came over to do the job. He did it with great skill, a sense of humor, and a lot of attention to detail. I highly recommend this company!< /Review>

Excellent service! I called in expecting to set up an appointment and Francisco was over in less than two hours! I had a snake in my back porch/patio area the night before, and he arrived quickly and searched thoroughly, killing two black widows in my closet in the process. He installed a snake fence (in one afternoon) and he was able to come up with ways to work around regulations which accommodated perfectly to my specific case! He even went above and beyond helping me get rid of some other bugs I had mentioned.
Excellent service, knowledgeable, and professional. Like I said before, Francisco went above and beyond! Not only that, this was all arranged for the next day; he knew I had a puppy and was concerned it couldn’t go outside. Highly recommended.< /review>

Theyid not disclose hidden costs up front.  Wanted an expert to get rid of a gopher and got two traps set by them with the assurance that one week was all that was needed.  Nearly three weeks later with no success, they were going to charge $75 to come out and move the traps.  When I said that wasn't discussed ahead of time, they agreed to move them once no charge.  They ended up showing up and taking the traps and didn't even knock on my door or indicate this was their plan.  So $150 to set two $30 traps and abandoned their job with no notice.  Extremely unprofessional and ineffective company!

UPDATE
The owner called me after my initial review and was apologetic, offered a full refund and a discount on future services.  A professional resolution to an unprofessional experience, which he assured is not typical.  Still left with a gopher destroying my yard after 3 weeks, but I'll get him myself now, so 5 stars for the owner and 3 for my overall experience given the wasted time and wrecked front yard.<//Text>

Thank goodness for Advanced Wildlife Removal!  Although living in a suburban area, we have been overrun with varmints -- skunks, raccoons, squirrels, opossums, rats, etc.
Found Advanced online and checked their excellent reviews and gave them a try. Frank and his wife Pam, the owners, and all of the licensed technicians have been responsive, gracious, efficient and prompt. Thus far, in two separate usages, they have trapped and removed a total of 10 critters. Highly recommend!< /text>

My name is AC Khan and I live in Orange Hills.
I have a Racoon and Bat issue. Frank was on time, courteous and very knowledgeable about his job! He did a great job inspecting the property including the entire roof and all the chimney covers. He provided photos of what he found and explained all of the possible solutions.
I found him to be genuine and honest which is hard to find nowadays!

Thank you and I look forward to working with you and the company!< /Review>

Cant say enough about Advanced Wildlife- they took care of a rat problem and followed up weekly.  Great service, prompt response, and immediate resolution.  Mike did a thorough inspection and kept coming out until it was resolved.  Which entailed climbing on the roof, climbing under the house, checking all crawl spaces, and plugging any possible entry points.  No other extermination groups out there offer this kind of service.  Plus offer a guarantee- They solved our issue and do remedial construction work as well.  Would recommend them to anyone with this type of issue.< /Text>

I've used these guys a few times, twice for gophers in my lawn and recently for something in my attic that turned out to be nothing. They are always professional, honest, and experts at what they do. I highly recommend them any time you think you have an unwanted critter on or in your property.</Review>

Advanced wildlife technician Mike Muir came out to help me get rid of a skunk.  I called five different wildlife removal services and Advanced had the best price by far.  The caged animal was removed quickly without any spraying accidents!  Mike  was able to remove the animal under very stressful conditions “rude neighbor”.  Thanks for the professional service and staying cool under pressure.  I will be using Advanced Wildlife again in the future.</text>

If I could give Advanced Wildlife Removal and 100 stars I would! We had a critter in our fireplace but it was actually behind the firebox wall and I called that night and spoke to Frank and he said he could have someone out the next day. Frank was super nice and honest and gave me upfront pricing and I knew I was in good hands after talking to Frank and seeing all of the five star reviews on yelp. Shad arrived at my house the next day right on time and quickly got to the heart of the matter. Shad was very professional, super nice and very patient. He made sure that every access point to my fireplace and attic was secured and closed off before leaving. My brother, who is a licensed contractor, actually talked to Shad on the phone while he was here and my brother was very impressed. Also, having been a contractor for several years, my brother could not believe how thorough Shad was and said the pricing is lower and the quality of work higher than any other company he has seen. They promise to take care of critters that are where they’re not supposed to be and they deliver! No matter what type of critter problem you have, I promise you will not find a more qualified and less expensive company than Advanced Wildlife Removal.</text>

<review>It was a good choice to find this company through Google Search when I heard the sound of a small animal in my ceiling. First of all, even though it was a rainy day because of fear that our house might be filled with rats, we always made a reservation faithfully according to the weather. And Mike Julian came to my house and went up to the roof to do all the work.
It is an honest company that handles post-processing well from the consumer's point of view, and also provides a 5-year warranty and money bag guarantee.
Currently, there is no sound from our ceiling. What do you need anymore?<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd987cbc28eb3:0x109f05f1f8e5ce51</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
After 3 years of watching my husband play Caddy Shack with the gophers on our slope we contacted Advanced Wildlife Removal. Tim has been incredibly helpful. He explained all of our options and we decided to go with traps. So far I think we have caught 7 gophers!! Due to the landscape around our house we will most likely always have an issue with gophers but thanks to Tim and AWR we no longer having ½ of our landscape disappear overnight. We tried everything DIY before calling Advanced Wildlife Removal and I highly recommend just calling them first!</review>

This company was really great!😊
They are super responsive, fair prices, very thorough, easy to communicate with, and super easy to work with. I had trapped a possum that was living under my house and they (Tim) came out right away to remedy my situation. Tim was really helpful at checking for other entry points and making suggestions to keep possums from digging thru/under my screened crawl space.</review>

I called the company yesterday (a Sunday) and within an hour or so they sent out a guy named Cole. He was out here ready to take care of our bee problem. He was very courteous and eager to help us resolve our emergency situation. Within a couple of hours he took care of the problem and we were able to rest assured that everything was fine. I would highly recommend the company and if you want to get the work done fast and efficiently ask for Cole R. He was truly a life-saver.< /review>

Mathew was great! He was communicative before he arrived, during his visit, and post visit. He did a complete walk through of the property to identify rodent entry points. Assessed the situation and determined it was rats, explaining why. He laid down some traps and was informative as to what he was doing. And what to expect. Professional and efficient.

I am very pleased with Frank from Advanced Wildlife Removal’s service. He was punctual and thorough by inspecting every nook in my house. I have been dealing with rats in the attic from having fruits trees in the backyard since last year. Intermittently, whenever I hear noises in the attic, Frank will come out to inspect my house.
Now, I dealing with gophers and Frank is taking care of them.
I recommend Frank to anyone who is experiencing annoying pests in their home.
Frank is professional, easy going and his prices for his services are reasonable.

Thank you Frank!< /Review>

Racoons had attacked our cat and reached out to Advanced Wildlife Removal for help.  Had a great experience with Tim.  He came out the next morning, let me know when he was coming and gave me some good information about racoons and what to expect - very cordial.  He set a couple of traps and I hope to see him again soon.<//Review>

<text>I've had these guys out three times. They are polite, very thorough, respond quickly and are very reasonably priced.  I have felt totally comfortable with both guys that have been in my home.   Honestly, I would give them more than five stars if I could!
I initially called them because we heard something moving around in our attic during the night. Devon came out, didn't find any animals up there at the time but did find a couple of places where rats could get in. He took pictures of the openings and gave me an estimate for sealing everything up and setting some rat traps in the attic, which included a good warranty on their work. I had him do the work and when it was finished he took pictures of the work he had done. A week or two later we thought we heard something up there again and even though there wasn't anything in the rat traps, he came back out just to go up and make sure there was still nothing there and that everything was secure.
Jump forward about five months to today: My husband checks the traps periodically and had never found anything in them until just just this week when he found one with a dead rat in it.
I called  this morning and Tim came out today. He went up into the attic and thoroughly inspected and found a new opening, likely made by a raccoon. He  made sure there was nothing alive up there, and took pictures to show me, as well as showing me the hole which was visible from the outside He sealed it off and didn't charge me for the work!
On top of all that, after the terrible Santa Ana winds this week, I found a vent cap laying in my yard. Tim offered to see if it had come from my roof and if so, put it back in place for me - which he did!  That was way above and beyond the call of duty!</text><gmapID>0x80dcd987cbc28eb3:0x109f05f1f8e5ce51< /gmapID>< Pictures>

Matthew was kind, honest and professional. We thought we had a raccoon and he did a very thorough inspection of possible entry points. He patched up the hole and put some rat traps up in the attic. Hopefully this will be the end. Fast and efficient. Very reasonable prices too. Highly recommend this company for unwanted house guests! He also did call to tell me his ETA which was much appreciated. Thanks Matthew!!<//text>

Frank and his company provided excellent Service and great communication, arrived on time and went about the business of locating an entry to our crawl space and placing traps for the rats that entered. Frank returned and removed the rodent and sealed up all visible entry points.
Excellent experience, Highly recommend and very reasonable price service.< /Text>

All in 1 service -  bird nest removal, 3 areas where he put screening to prevent birds from
nesting and cutting/disposal of multiple palm fronds so rats won’t have access to my roof(saving me a call to my tree guy). He was on time and job did not take long. Highly recommend.</Review>

< Review>
Great service and prices, family owned. Quoted me over the phone and didn’t charge a penny more. Kyle crawled under my house which you can only crawl and schooch on your stomach (extremely tight and claustrophobic.) Checked every corner found 2 dead possums and didn’t charge extra. Two other pest removal services said they could not get to them or even attempt to go under the house and said they would eventually decay. Kyle is friendly and brave. My family and I are forever grateful.<//Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>We just had our house fumigated (tented) and a few days later a dead animal smell became apparent in the house. We've previously had rats in our attic so I thought one or two got knocked out during the fumigation. I called Advanced Wildlife Removal to see if they could find and remove the dead animal(s) and they sent Kyle out. Kyle worked tirelessly for a long time trying to locate the dead animal and narrowed it down to a specific location in the attic. He needed to open the walls in the area to get to the source of the smell and I did not want him to do that. I know in a few days the smell will be gone so that's good enough for now.

We smelled something rotten coming from our attic. I went up to check and there was an opossum. I called and they were able to come in a couple of hours. Tim removed the opossum (it was already dead) cleaned up the area, and inspected to find out where it got in. The price was more than reasonable.</Text>

<text>Have had to use these folks twice within the last year to remove dead animals from under our deck. Two different guys, but both efficient, professional, friendly (and brave for wading into the stink and mess!). Both also took up and reinstalled our deck planking, cleaned residue and used mild bleach to reduce the smell and the possibility of bacterial overgrowth. Cost was about $200 each time (because of extra labor) but well worth the money. Highly recommended.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Why have I put up with squirrels ruining my yard, digging holes, dislodging fence stakes and eating my garden for so long? Finally, in desperation I called the first company that poppped up on my computer search. What a lucky shot-in-the-dark: amazing service! They answered their phone on a holiday; came out the next day; arrived on time and the technician couldn’t have been more professional or personable. It was a pleasure to know the price of each service upfront and have no surprise fees. I appreciate their philosophy of treating animals humanely. Advanced Wildlife Removal gets five stars from me!</review>

They quickly responded to my call and sent Mike Julian to remove rodent droppings under my outdoor BBQ... a task your standard pest control company will not do.  Mike aggressively cleaned out the entire area under the outdoor structure and found a rats nest between the refrigerator and a built in drawer unit that was not visible unless you climbed inside the structure. In addition, mike checked the structure for any openings and is installing a barrier to hopefully prevent the rodent from getting inside again.
If I could give a higher rating than 5 stars, I would.

I've called dozens of pest control businesses over the past year and no one does as great a job as Shad.  All of the larger pest control businesses send out technicians to perform "inspections." I had one technician pop his head in my attic and tell me there were no entry points for rats. Not sure how he came to that conclusion with one glance. You want the inspection done? You want results? Shad is the man. Shad, from Advanced Wildlife Removal, jumped on my second story roof within the first 10 minutes of meeting me and found exactly how the rat was entering. He even went into my attic and extracted the dead rat that was wedged in between walls which was causing the worst smell ever. This guy is the ghost whisperer of rats and can do it all. I can't say enough good things about this company. Thank you.< /Review><user_name>Lance Holloway</user_name></record>

I’m so happy , I haven’t had any missing avocados since .not only do his traps work better than mine , but he’s nice he’s friendly and he had the best pricing of all the companies I called !< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1509602166818, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review Jennifer now hopefully u can enjoy your avocados instead of the raccoon!'}</response><gmapID>0x80dcd987cbc28eb3:0x109f05f1f8e5ce51< /gmapID></record>

Great guy! Had a skunk spray under my new house. Other company's wanted way more to just set a trap.  Frank actually went under the house to inspect if we had a skunk or not. No skunk he sealed up vent!! Great work at a fraction of the cost. Thanks again<//text>

I can't say enough about Advanced Wildlife.  They solved my rat in the attic problem and came out to my house in an hour when I trapped a skunk.  Special thanks to Devon and Jeff for taking care of our pest problem!<//Text>

i just caught another raccoon and Frank with the Advanced Wildlife removal came out right away to pick him up. He was really stressed and hated to see him that way. It's nice having a company to take care of these animals. Frank is so knowledgeable about the wildlife and handles them like an expert.<//review>

< review>
I had rats in my attic and wall for over a year. I had another company come out first with no results. I went online to read reviews and found Advanced Wildlife Removal. Tim came out right away and went all around the house and found all of their entry points and sealed them. He then set traps in the attic and within a week there were no more rats running in our attic. I cannot say enough about this company. We had this problem off and on for years and now we are rat free thanks to Tim and his expertise.< /review>

<Text>I was referred to Jesse by a friend to work on my 1988 Ferrari 328 GTS. It is the first time I’ve had a Ferrari, although I have had other collector cars. Jesse was easy to work with and explained what my car needed, which included a major belt service. His work went above and beyond what I had expected and there was never any pressure from anyone there. Jesse was such a pleasure to work with.

I will definitely return there in the future for all of my services. I highly recommend San Francisco Motorsports.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Had my 2007 Porsche 911 Turbo serviced (the 40,000 mile service) at San Francisco Motorsports recently. I've had this car for 10 years and have had some awesome modifications done, including a tune, new suspension, forged HRE wheels, and am very picky about any work done on this car.

I was very pleased with the service provided by SF Motorsports and the care they took in servicing my car. This will definitely be my go-to shop for anything my Turbo needs in the future.</Text>

<Text>Just completed a major service and related repairs on my newly-acquired Ferrari 355.  Outstanding experience.  Jesse carefully explained everything that I needed, and gave sound advice consistent with a meticulous inspection of every aspect of the car.  Highly recommended.<//Text>< pics>

I’ve been to SF Motorsports 4 times for pre purchase inspections (F430, California, and 2 Quattroportes) and had a fantastic experience each time I was there. Jesse and the staff are super knowledgeable and make you feel confident in what they find on their inspections. Prices are very fair and they are just nice people. Always enjoy my time there just talking cars with guys. One of the best shops in the Bay Area for high end cars. Highly recommend!<//Text>

Repair was done in a timely fashion and the top now works perfectly.  Team is very professional, friendly, and straightforward.  Will be using  them for future maintenance and repairs. Highly recommended.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80859a02a3b9bca1:0x31d60f05897bf175< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Jesse from San Raphael picked up my car same day. They provided me expert knowledgeable service. My car was seen at the Maserati dealership twice as well as an Indy shop which they could not figure out what was wrong with my car. Sf Motorsport swapped out my F1 pump on my 2005 Maserati. They also provided follow up service to make sure my car was running okay. I highly recommend their service!

<Review>What a fantastic discovery. All I needed was a quick change of bulbs in my headlight got quoted $75 at other locations. Called San Francisco Motorsports, they got me right in and replaced the bulb I was in an out in 10 minutes cost me $20. Great to work with very pleasant would recommend them highly they do auto repair and hybrid repair too!<//Review>< Pictures>

I have dealt with Matt on several projects and found him to be very honest and enthusiastic. Even more amazing is that he communicates well AND in a timely manner.
These things are very important to me and i want the sense that my car dealer/friend is willing and able to communicate, pay attention and be a pleasure to talk to.
Matt is all these things.< /Review>

Very warm and welcoming shop, and beyond accommodating! Jesse and crew, know their cars and warranty their work. It’s a team you really feel like you can trust. I have had many experiences at other shops were you feel you just can’t trust them. It is a very different story at San Francisco Motor Sports.< /Text>

Jesse and team are just awesome. Being Ferrari factory trained, they have deep knowledge of both classic and modern Ferraris. I really appreciate their promptness and proactive communication - it's quite refreshing! And I especially appreciate the back/forth delivery service within the Bay Area where they pick up your car on a secure trailer, do some great servicing, and deliver it back to you when ready. It's my first time working with SF Motorsports, it will not be my last. A++++, thank you!<//Text>

Took my 599 in for its 3 year service recently - the prices are fair and the quality of work is very high. I was impressed both by their attention to detail and the thorough manner in which Jesse described the work done. They won't charge you for unnecessary items as they value long-term client relationships. Thanks SF Motorsports!<//Text>

My gf and I used to bring our Prius to Daly City Toyota for regular maintenance but got tired of the oversell and waking up at 5am just to lineup for service. The last straw was when we arrived at 6am at Daly City Toyota only to be told that there is no guarantee that they'll be able to do our oil change that day. We tried scheduling but often need to be made a week or two in advance.<//review>

Just got my beautiful 98 Ferrari F355 Berlinetta delivered back to my home after new engine and gearbox mounts and a muffler change out. So impressed with Jesse and Jim his Ferrari specialist. These guys are thorough with attention to detail, easy to communicate with, professional and the prices are fair for the work done.

Will definitely return for anything my Ferrari might need in the future.</text>

I knew I needed work on my Land Rover LR4. These guys made it so convenient! Jesse picked up my car in Santa Rosa and I didn't have to do a thing. They offered me a loaner car but i didn't need it. I soon got a call to go over my needed repairs. I really liked getting price options and no sales pressure. I have definitely found my mechanic.
Thank you Daniel and Jesse!!< /Text>

<review>I must say that I'm absolutely pleased with San Francisco Motorsports and Jesse.

I had an appointment with a different Auto Repair shop but decided to give Jesse (who spoke quite confidently and knowledgeably about repair and maintenance of foreign cars like mine) a benefit of the doubt - after all, how badly can one service a car?  Besides, he'd pick the car and drop off a loaner...really, of course, sure .

In the course of the day, I had a rundown/diagnostics on my car (some of which I was aware) and there was nothing that was done without my full consent and approval.

Needless to say, they were professional, explained and helped  to prioritize my required repair even with a picture sent to me, and delivered the car at my residence.  No ambiguity, no hassles, no hiccups....just a very pleasant and satisfying experience.  Hahahaha I called Jesse a "good omen"  - no heart feelings.

Cheers!< /review>< Date>

Doug and John are true enthusiasts. After semi-retired Brian Crall- the Ferrari author and guru of gurus- told me that the only person he would trust with his own car is John, I was a believer! John and Doug have both gone out of their way to be sure the maintenance on my car has been both convenient and obsessively performed to the point of perfection. Definitely two thumbs up!</review>

<Text>I initially became aquainted with Jesse and SFMSS when my employer’s car required some custom work. I felt immediately taken care of and received excellent service including more than a few conseierge pick ups and drop offs. Jesse and his shop have kept this exceptional car in top form, and even helped us through a minor accident which has a lot of moving parts. This relationship has bloomed into a one stop shop for all of the family’s cars and  employee cars too, including myself. From simple pollen filter changes after the fires to major services. I couldn’t ask for a more honest and talented crew. I highly recommend SFMSS to anyone looking for top notch service and know how.</Text><user_id>118126132910949382704<//user_id><Rating>5<//Rating>< response>

The Doctor Makes House Calls???  2004 360 Modena issue suspension, analyzed and repaired!

"House Calls", almost unheard of these days, but Jessie came out to the house to help analyze an issue that seemed to represent itself turning out of the driveway going down hill.  After extensive diagnostics, the "sound" turned out to be a tie-rod end and not a wheel bearing, first suspect,  which would have been much more expensive.  The process, they replaced the wheel bearing which didn't solve the problem, the original bearing was refitted, I really appreciated not having to pay for something the car didn't need ... that's honesty and integrity in the repair process, plus excellent communications during the "noodling out" of the problem solving process.

In the end, excellent experience, took some time, and got it right!  5 Gold Stars to the SFMS team, on this project!

They're a full service shop, they "baby sat" my 360 Modena and XK8 Convertible for two months this summer while on vacation, the XK8 had some minor repairs done, so back home better than before.

In short, "Highly Recommended".

In a nutshell, if you are buying a car from these guys, I would be very weary of their ‘used car sales tactics’.  Given that they had decent reviews online, I was pretty shocked when having to deal with them.

So here’s my story.  I tried to buy a Scuderia from them (VIN ZFFKW64AX90166313).  Evan, their sales guy, was the epitome of a slimeball used car salesman.  He never called me back in a timely manner, jacked up the price using sob stories about how the owner does so much charity and how much he paid for the car.  On a used car, those things don’t matter.  The car is worth what it’s worth in the market.  Then, after I made concessions and we were moving to close the deal the next day, I started making plans to fly up.  He texts me late that evening and says he’s too busy with his family.  I don’t fault him for wanting to be with his family, but don’t lead me on by making me think that I should fly up only to change your mind later.  Usually a sales guy will bend over backwards if he has a potential sale especially as large as this and will sacrifice a couple hours on a weekend to close the deal.  Not Evan.
Then after using these delay tactics, he attempts to raise the price again saying the owner wants full asking price.  I told him, no one goes into the used car market to get full asking price on a car, especially a mass produced one.  If the owner wanted full asking price, he should have priced it $5-10k more than what was listed!  I came up a little more seeing that I didn’t want to lose this car over $1-2k and stipulated that the final price include shipping.  He comes back to me a day later and says, ‘We have a deal!  But I’m going to make an executive decision.  I’m going up a couple hundred dollars more since it’s essentially the same number.’  Executive decision?  Only a couple hundred more after I came up over $3 grand on a relatively very high mileage car that had been tracked numerous times and clearly showed signs of track wear?  Are you serious?  You can’t make this stuff up.  I ask about the shipping included that we had discussed.  He denied ever hearing about it.  Safe as to say, I did not buy the car from this sleazy character.  I have never seen a sales guy with such poor customer service and so unmotivated to sell a car.  His ‘used car salesman’ schemes were straight out of a movie.  I could not believe the nerve of this guy.

To be fair, I can’t speak about the mechanic services at SF Motorsports.  And they do seem to have good reputation in that regard which is very strange considering my horrendous experience.  But if you’re ever considering buying a high end vehicle from these characters, especially if you’re dealing with a guy named Evan, I WOULD BE VERY WEARY OF HIS SHENANIGANS.  It’s just not worth wasting your time with the games he plays.</Review>

Bill Kennedy, A Big Guy with a bigger heart !  We are fairly close in age and I have off and on been riding for many years. This is a first review for me and unsolicited by anyone. I am not into rating or judging people, But just had to comment on Bill, have been riding  with the exception of a Victory Motorcycle which are , or should be making Harley`s for the price sit up and take notice. Have been in Bill`s store many times and changed my mind and went for new bikes , metric`s mostly. Told Bill once sorry I have been in your store and never made a purchase, Bill`s first words were So what, just stop in anytime and we can just talk bikes. Started riding in the early 60`s , but each time I stop in I leave with a wealth of knowledge, Listen to Bill ! I taught safety for a major airline for 28 years, And was pretty good at it. Bill put`s things  in your head, that just may save your hide. A Great guy, and if you do purchase a used Harley he lists a true review of the bike from the ground up. Do yourself a favor, Stop by and check his inventory, He will tell you if your choice is right for you or to pass on it and pick another bike. Never ran up on a guy like him, he would rather loose a sale than sell you something that will get you in big trouble , Or Worse !
Thanks Bill for watching out for us. With the new video game drivers out there You are what we need to get home safe.
Bill J.
PS. Bill or his great staff had nothing to do with this lengthy review, His Big Heart  sharing knowledge, I just would not feel right,not giving him due credit.
BE SAFE !< /text>

Bill Kennedys shop  is a "mom & pop" bike shop. Family oriented, and friendly. Customers and homeless are both afforded respect. Many "custom" shops have come and gone in Oceanside, during the " Orange County Chopper" craze through the " "Sons of Anarchy" craze, Bill's shop crushed the competition with good quality used bikes, friendly advice, and excellent mechanic service, not to mention being a positive part of the community of Oceanside thru charity's and events.  They are the real deal, not a "chain store" of bikes.</Review>

I shopped and looked for 2 years and Bill never pushed or tried to "sell" me anything...I would come in every week to check out new inventory and Bill would always say, "don't rush it, you'll find the one that fits you, bikes were like buses, another one will come along soon."  Go by and talk bikes with Bill and staff and support their events.

Any time I go there I get exactly what I need with out the pressure to buy something that I don't need. They treat their patrons like you would a friend they will joke around with you and have a normal conversation it's not just about sales. You can go there and share riding experiences. They also host toys for tots.<//text>

<Review>What an incredible hole in the wall! If you want amazing customer service and a true definition of a homely feeling, look no further! I received valuable and informative facts on products best suited for my needs ( I deal with severe anxiety) and was given amazing treatment and thorough steps to help soothe my anxiousness! Courtney and Stella were so personable and I felt great walking out, knowing I had the best product I’ve been searching for! Come to this store, you honestly won’t regret it!<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
I was referred to Courtney from another dog owner who had a barky, stressed dog like mine. At this point, I had tried a thunder jacket, several different calm treats and a special calming/natural powder that I sprinkled on my dog's food daily. Some items worked a little bit and for a short time, but nothing worked and my dogs constant barking at birds, airplanes and anyone walking down the street was making our family miserable.
I contacted Courtney and she gave me samples of her products to help calm dogs. Oh My Gosh! Not only did our dog love them all, they worked! The CBD treats do not leave him feeling "drugged" like other products can!!!! Courtney was amazing in answering my many questions and working with me to make sure I knew the correct dosage for our dog. He is a Norfolk Terrier/Yorkie mix and we finally have peace in our household because of Courtney and the amazing products from Your CBD Store.

THANK YOU COURTNEY!!!!</Review>

Thank you, Stella, for making Jellybean the happiest girl on the planet!!! 👑 The Sun Med Cat Snacks you recommended are not only helping her many ailments, they apparently taste incredible, too. I feel good about treating her to something that’s actually good for her, unlike the corn-based kitty crack in the supermarket! 🙀Thank you for your knowledge, expertise, and superior customer service. Oh, and the free samples, too! 🥰</Text>

My dog is 6 years old and has always been afraid of swimming after I gave her CBD she jumped right in and swam for the first time in her life like it was nothing.</Text>< pics>

<review>I came into the store recently to pick up a tincture for my mom as she’s been having a lot of back pain. Lexi helped me pick the right product and offered a lot of knowledge along the way. I also appreciated her asking if I’d like to try anything for myself. I sampled the CBN as I’ve been having trouble with sleep and it worked wonderfully. Can’t wait to come back and purchase this for myself!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I just recently found this place and I love that the products are organic and it’s all made and grown in the USA. I even found some vegan gummies here. They have a great selection of high quality CBD here. I was so grateful for the knowledgeable staff. I learned some new facts and got free samples. I’m so glad I found this store.<//text>

Great products. Personally, I enjoy the 10mg soft gell capsules the most. Helps with headaches, anxiety, and sleep at night. As someone who has been using marijuana for years and has recently become sober, these capsules have really helped me to stay sober.</Text>

I’m so happy I went into this CBD store. Everyone here who helped me was so kind and knowledgeable. Brian helped me right when I walked in and showed me all the different products and even let me sample one since I had so many questions for him. This really is a great store if you are interested in CBD. I chose broad spectrum so I wouldn’t worry about random drug tests at my work. I know I’ll be back again once I run out. This store & their knowledge about cbd should be everywhere— oh wait, it is ;)— so many other locations too! With anxiety, depression, pms & panic attacks, I now know this is my go to place!</Review>

<Text>I have an anxiety and a friend of mine recommended trying cbd, so I figured I’d try it out. I had never been to a cbd store before and wow is this one pretty. it’s very clean and open, I get anxious in new places I’ve never been and this one made me feel at ease! I was helped by Lexi, she did an amazing job telling me all about cbd and the products. I ended up getting the water soluble cbd and so far I really love it! I add it to my green drink in the morning everyday. she also gave me some free samples including lotion, a gummy and the oil! it was a great first experience and I will definitely be coming back for more!!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

A week ago I came to the CBD store in hopes of finding something to help with anxiety, relaxation and sleeping.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by CBD Brian. He went above and beyond to educate me on the products and explain how CBD works.  I ended up getting a tincture, a vape cartridge and some hemp flower.  It’s now been a week and I’ve never felt better.  Thanks again!</Review>

I had been curious about CBD for a while now, especially since my mother had came here to get dog treats for our very anxious dog and it seemed to help him. Because I deal with chronic anxiety, I finally decided trying CBD wouldn’t hurt. When I came here I was greeted by two lovely women, Nicole and Lauren. I know very little about CDB but they informed me very well about it’s benefits on the body and even gave me a sample of their water soluble product. Please if any people are interested in CBD at all, this is definitely the place to come. Even the environment inside is so calming and relaxed. Thank you Nicole and Lauren! 😊</review>

Every time I come to this location, I’m met with professional, knowledgeable, and friendly staff. Pride of ownership is evident in the cleanliness and aesthetic of the store, and in the interaction.

The products offered here are second to none. As a person who deals with chronic pain, including chronic migraine, what I put into my body matters a great deal. I use “Neuro” every single day because it helps in so many areas! I get relief from fibromyalgia, plantar fasciitis, and a reduction in frequency and severity of my migraines. I cannot say enough about how this product has enhanced the quality of my life!< /text>

I was very skeptical cuz I've you CBD products before and they didn't do very much but after using their free sample they gave me I immediately came back to the store within 20 minutes and bought the large jar. And I have to say I'm absolutely astounded I've been with level 10 pain in my shoulders and my hands and my hips for the last four months and this was the first time in four months that I've been paying free I find that I used it three times a day and with that I have been pain free now for 3 days I am an absolute fan of these products and can't say enough about how many miraculous it has been for me I highly recommend anybody to go in there try a free sample and let the results speak for themselves!<//text>

< review>
I started taking Sunmed CBD consistantly in October of 2018 for Anxiety and Depression. I had been prescribed Anti Depressants and an Anti Anxiety medication that I wasn't comfortable taking due to the possible side effects. Within two weeks of taking CBD, I noticed a major difference in my daily anxiety and depression symptoms. This product gave me my life back. I am incredibly grateful to have found such an effective supplement to help manage my anxiety and depression.< /review>

<user_id>116020564436081169129<//user_id><date>1602920054910< /date><review>BEST CBD STORE AND STAFF PERIOD!!!

I've been to multiple stores around ventura county that sell cbds and NOTHING has compared to the quality of CBD I recieve from Your CBD Store.

Not only is it their own proprietary recipes but ever item has info to 3rd party lab results. Yes every item.

After using their products, which are worth every penny, I've been relatively pain free for the last month. I smoke the Blueberry AK carts and have used the topical. For the first time in 6 years I went to bed and woke up with no back pain. I have spondylolisthesis 1 at 15%+ slide. I finally go to bed and sleep through the night.

They have multiple referral programs and discounts.

Haha also got CBD jerky with natural ingredients for my neurotic Queensland healer with separation anxiety and have seen a noticeable different with 2 sticks a day (10mg) each.

Their new hire Nicole is super informative and pleasant to see each visit. Help this business thrive. Nowhere else anyone interested or using CBDs should buy from. YOU WILL LOVE THESE PRODUCTS!!

<text>So I got into this store to get a replacement of a CBD stick that helped with my tendonitis.  Unfortunately, that product is no longer available online. So I came here and had two very helpful staff people work with me. Holly was one of them and Devon was the other. Very friendly, professional, kind and lastly, knowledgeable. Tried a few things, and really liked their body lotion. Smelled incredible with a mild cucumber scent. Ended up purchasing a roll-on pain relief product. Goes on smoothly which made it easy to massage into the most tender areas of my pain. Left the store with a few samples and with my tendinitis feeling better within 15 minutes. Come check it out!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I waited for a year to put these comments so it's fair. Melanie has made our stay from start to finish very enjoyable.. the maintenance folks are quick and very friendly. The location is very good since it's off the freeway Newport exit. Close to shopping and newemigrr Town Center.< /Text>

I had visited this property several times to view the complex prior to inquiring about the availability or cost of an apartment. I noticed that this complex has a great location however that is where it ends. It appears that the property management does not ensure proper maintenance of the property especially with the grounds keeping dead grass and dying grass in front of several apartments. I also noticed that the Leasing Office is at the entrance of the property prior to the entry gates however the gates are left completely opened during the Leasing Office hours. I ask you... what is the point of having a gated community and not shut the gates to only those that have a confirmed access to the property.< /review>

So, let me start by saying the women that work in this office are AMAZING! They are personable, respectful, friendly, inviting, and very well informed! It is more than obvious that they work well as a team and communicate when it comes to future residents that are in the application process. Now, sadly I wasn't able to be approved by the leasing company that they run credit checks through, but even in that they worked with me for around 2 weeks to help with the process and keeping me informed. No matter how many times i called they answered with a friendly tone and eager to help. When i was officially denied by the Onsite, they informed me with the most genuine and sincere compassion and empathy. Not only that but they had what they didn't know was the solution t my 3 month long rental search. They referred me to a company that amazingly approved me within 2 days. They were helpful , genuine, professional and extremely friendly from the start to the finish. I am new to Menifee and let me just tell you although i wont be renting from The Enclave, the ladies here gave me the best introduction to Menifee with their customer services. THEY DID IT IN A DAMN QUARENTINE! Thank you so much Sawyer, Melanie & Randy ! You guys were beyond amazing. I appreciate your help and guidance to my new home. I am absolutely amazed with their level of customer service and over all work ethic. !!</text>

I have lived here for about a year and a half and I am shocked at the bad reviews because Ive only had great memories here! The office staff, before and after property management change, were all very friendly and willing to answer any and all questions! I did have an annoying neighbor and you can hear everyone slamming their doors and shaking the entire complex but what can you do.
Ive moved out a couple of days ago and even then the leasing office has been so great and so has maintenance! You get what you give, ultimately.
Thank you Enclave for the 1.5 years!</Text>

In fact, these stains soaked through the carpet backing and onto the pad. These stains do not resemble foot traffic patterns.

During the process of moving you in, they are nice, easy going and will act as if they are understanding. But after the ink dries on the documents it's all different. There were issues with the carpet before we moved in. It had patchwork in various parts of the house. It was even pulling up on various parts of the carpet. Then they claimed that I did the patchwork before I moved out. Telling me I wasn't allowed to do that. I said It was there before I moved. The lady said that was impossible because they don't do patchwork. Then I showed her the photos I had taken and she still wouldn't acknowledge the truth. She said  Then the water heater busted around January/February. It ruined various items in the house including our mattress. They didn't want to help with replacing the items or help with part of the deductible with our renter insurance. They just shrugged their shoulders and said, "sorry". Then when it was time for us to move out, they didn't do a walk through with us. Claiming it's on us to schedule it but it clearly says in the move out document the renter will contact the rentee. I had to point that out to them. Then they said, "oh but you didn't put a contact number". Really, like you don't know our address and cellphone number already? Then, of course, the move out bill comes in. With the various move out charges.  The one I wanted dispute was the entire apartment carpet replacement. They claimed there were stains everywhere, but the photos don't accurately depict where? Then I said, what about the water damage and the organic and none organic material that was brought into the apartment? What about the possible work stains that could have occurred when your worker was in there? Or what about the annual inspection when inspectors come in? The stains could have occurred in all these various situations. They wouldn't acknowledge that such events could ruin the carpet. So rentee beware. They expect you to pull up the carpet before you move in, black light the whole house, find any minute carpet errors, and find every error possible.</text>

<name>Greg Reynoso</name>< review>
We’ve lived here for over 4 years and we have never asked for much of the front office staff, sadly however, when I called and spoke to the dark hair girl, Jessica, about cleaning up the concerning amounts of trash and filth at the dumpster in front of our building, she immediately snapped back and was unwilling to help. She has shown complete lack of empathy nor any will to do her job, twice.

First off, you can’t walk into the dumpster area because of how much constant trash is piled up, not to mention the unsanitary conditions this poses to the residents. I’ve witnessed rodents including raccoons and rats in the dumpster area due to the properties negligence, and “money-saving” service of moving the trash around from dumpster to dumpster as Jessica proudly explained.

I called the front office today to complain about the conditions, and when I recommended that they have Waste Management pickup an additional time during the week, she quickly, and loudly cut me off to say “Yeah, well that’s an extra $5,000” in her usual condescending tone. She went on to tell me that she would call their own maintience crew to see what they could do. I’m glad to now know that the health and well-being of your residents comes second to money. You can view the attached photo to see what I had to walk down to this morning.

I would not recommend leasing with Enclave Menifee, as this is one of many incidents we’ve encountered while living here. I will be filing a formal complaint to all state departments regarding this ongoing public-health issue.

Enclave, don’t @ me. Your brand is tarnished.< /review>

I've lived here for almost a year and absolutely love it. I am astonished by the bad reviews, because I've had nothing but great pleasure since moving here.
Management is professional with great customer service. All my neighbors are nice, and I've never had any problems. Only thing that can be frustrating is the lack of parking. Which honestly isn't a big deal.
Located within walking distance to a nice shopping center as well as MSJC.
Facilities are always clean and well kept, and landscaping does an amazing job at keeping the aesthetics looking beautiful. All around amazing place! Definitely would recommend.< /review>

I've already moved out wasn't too bad when I first moved in, in 2009 i have been out of that complex for 3 years. However i have been going back and fourth with the IGNORANT ASSISTANT Manager Amber. who clearly needs to be trained as it seems she never was trained, in professionalism along with the current CA resident laws, and most importantly FAIR HOUSING. For most people who are not familiar with the laws i am sure get SCREWED big time. Thank god i had a copy of my lease agreement, as i am sure they were hoping i didn't. BAM in writing as Melanie requested so they can adjust the account NO BUY OUT  amount was in the lease agreement yet they still tried to get money and they don't want to hear me out. Well this is definitely a FAIR HOUSING CASE. PEOPLE JUST BEWARE AND DO YOUR HOME WORK AS RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY GOOD PAYING RESIDENTS WHO GET GET SCREWED IN THE END. IF I COULD GIVE 0 OR MINUS STARS I WOULD HAVE BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. I AM NOT ONE TO POST BUT THIS COMPANY REALLY NEEDS TO INVESTIGATED WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEY TRY TO RUN UNDER. I KNOW FOR SURE THEY WILL BE GETTING A VISIT FROM THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE FAIR HOUSING ALONG WITH AN INVESTIGATION. SO GIRLS I SUGGEST YOU GET THOSE FILES IN ORDER CAUSE AN AUDIT IS COMING YOUR WAY. SO BE THANKFUL YOU HAVE BEEN INFORMED YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETIME TO GET YOUR ACT RIGHT!! GOOD LUCK!!< /text>

I have nothing bad to say about management and have not had a bad experience living here. The owners, "Sentinel", however, are extremely greedy and just want your money. Doesn't matter how loyal of a resident you've been. Cost of living has gone up tremendously, yes, but it doesn't mean they have to sky-rocket their prices. If you make a lot of money, good. But for a single mother, not so good. I've been a loyal resident for 5 years (this coming November), always paid my rent on time, have never caused any problems and they are raising my rent by $150.00 this coming November-and for a non renovated apt, at that. When I asked why so high, I was basically, in so many words told, because they can. I moved here in November of 2013 and only paid about $1224 (something around that price. I would have to get the paperwork out for the exact amount). Now, they want me to pay $1600 plus $57.00 for water, trash and sewer. That's a huge climb for apartments that are nothing extraordinary in comparison to the apartments on the other side of the college (The Cantabria). The Cantabria apartments are extremely nice; enclave is nothing in comparison. I don't know what they are thinking. This city, is nothing great. It's a city that is always crowded, has no Highschool of its own-still need to go to other cities to get items that are needed because this city still lacks the commodities that the bordering cities have, although, to be fair, they have built quite a bit since I moved here. There is really nothing to do here. It's a very boring and crowded city. I've found a couple of apartments in Temecula and Murrieta that are cheaper. And those two cities are way better than Menifee. I hope this review helps someone. My biggest issue is the huge rent climb every time the lease is renewed. Who knows how much they will price their apartments in a year. It's not worth the money. I'll tell you that much.</Review>

<Text>The entire time we lived here, they have been nothing but unprofessional. None of the management talks to each other so expect to have to talk to multiple people (probably multiple times) to get something done.

They give less than 24 hours notice when they need cars moved, and they'll mass-tow cars if you don't see the 8"x10" warning they sparingly scotch tape to the carports. You'll have to go weeks parking your car outside of the entire complex (5-10 minute walk if you're in the back) because they tape off 30% of the carports at a time, and there is barely uncovered parking.

When we moved out they took about a week to send us our moving out cost. And then put a late fee on it because they didn't send it until after the deadline..

The buildings and landscaping is nice and it's out of the way, but it's the most confused and mismanaged complex I've ever had the displeasure to work with.

Know that you're really going to regret moving in here if you choose to.< /Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1539268084069, 'text': 'Hi, Keith. While we always embrace resident feedback, we’re disappointed to read that you left our community feeling less than pleased with your experience here. We strive to maintain open lines of communication with our residents and we apologize if you feel we have not done so. To clarify, we sometimes have to ask our residents to move their cars temporarily for tree trimming or asphalt maintenance. We always give a 3-5 day warning ahead of time with a color-coded detailed map and letter handed out to each home. We also post these notices at the mailbox area and all clubhouse doors, in addition to carport posts. We do our best to schedule work into zones that are only closed for 24 hours while the remainder of the property parking is available for any displaced vehicles. If you would like to further discuss any fees associated with your move-out, please give our office a call and we would be happy to clear up any confusion. Thank you.'}<//resp>

The staff in the office was so rude.I wouldn't live here,you can find some where better for the cost.It may look all nice, but it is the worst place to live at.I feel so dumb on how much I pay and can not even play my music at 2 P.M. on a Saturday without having a problem.I hear people having sex next to me when i'm sleeping,like really you pay all that money and they cant get thicker walls.I cant wait till my lease is up so I can get out here quick and never come back.They have a really bad bug problem.Ants are every in the bathroom the living room bed room closet,i'm not even a dirty person. I clean up after my self all the time and theirs roaches coming out of no where and spiders in my bed  room. like really?I'm done with this place< /review>

Great coffee place very close to the sunset cliffs. Easy to grab a coffee and go watch the ocean and sunset. The staff is super nice and patient. They were just a crew of 3 but were handling the pickup and huge drive through queue very efficiently. I love the “Life’s better buzzed” merchandise as well in this place!
This is a chain so if you’re in San Diego, do try!<//review>

This place makes u wear a mask while going through a drive through while touching my coffee cup with their dirty hands. The point is if you are going to be super careful than be 100%. Don't fake to that you care because you don't. Not about customers or your own employees. To keep everyone safe you could have installed and rebuild that drive through window so people wouldn't have to touch with their dirty hands my food but you didn't you wanted to be cheap and you wanted to make people obey your coffee drive through window.<//review>< Time>

<Review>The staff at this location are the finest on Earth. I live in the neighbrhood, and am sometimes here twice a day, as a little break from my work to chat with the folks here, and also to get the best coffee.

I know they use "Black Magic" brand espresso, but I think their coffee is literal magic, because it's tasty, boosts my energy, and keeps me coming back all the time!

Their avocado toast is divine, and after two years of being a regular, I am still exploring their menu.

You'll always receive excellent customer service here, from genuine folks who work hard to fuel the neighborhood, and neighborhorhood visitors.

Shout-out to the the crew on all shifts: thank you for always remembering my name, and making my day a little better with your warmth and humor.

Y'all deserve a raise! Someday I need to buy stock in Better Buzz, if it ever goes public!

Thanks again for being a shinining model of a well-loved Mom and Pop business. We appreciate you!

I hate this better buzz. The people that frequent this better buzz location always block my driveway and are inconsiderate when I’m trying to simply pull in and go home after work. -10/10 work on your drive through.< /text>

F Starbucks’s, this is my new fave place lol 😍 I never liked açaí bowl before but they have the best I’ve ever tried. $9 a bowl for how much you get? Yesss. Other places charge $9.75 almost $10 for a small little 8oz bowl. I love this place, and their coffee? AMAZINGGGG. They always have wonderful customer service.<//text>

The attendants could be a tad more friendly when taking customer orders. But otherwise I love their Iced Best Drink ever and their Avocado toast plain, I tried adding bacon the other day but I hated it, it was very chewy almost like the bacon was made out of plastic.</review>

I love Better Buzz. They are better than Starbucks.  #ISaidWhatISaid
I'm giving PL 5 stars because the food and drinks are always on point.
However, customer service matters. I shouldn't have to hear a "yeah" or "yep" or "uh huh" when I ask a question. I know this is SoCal and things are a bit lax, but "yes" provides a level of customer service that seems to be disappearing for some reason.

This never happens at BB Miramar.</Review>

The staff are hard working, quick, and friendly. Their food is delicious and they even have some healthy choices. Not to mention the amazing coffee quality! There is also a drive through which is always handy.< /review>

Coffee, both drip and latte, was delish. We got sandwiches and baked goods and all were good sized portions and tasty. Definitely recommend! Parking is tough - there's a drive thru or street parking but you might need to walk a block or two.< /review>< Pics>

They either don’t take food allergies seriously or they simply don’t care. Every time (every time!!) I come here they get my order wrong. They look at me like I’m speaking a foreign language when I verify that I’m actually getting what I ordered at the pick-up window, “Oh, this is made with regular milk. Did you want coconut?” or “Oh, you wanted decaf? This definitely isn’t. Did you want decaf?” Yes, because that’s not only what I ordered but also what I enunciated specifically. The lack of comprehension and level of incompetence here is laughable. If it wasn’t the only convenient coffee place in the area that isn’t Starbucks I wouldn’t bother coming here.</text>

<Review>A lot of people highly recommended this place to us. The traffic for the drive thru was bad enough we had to skip it the first two days. Third day was the charm when we drove by just minutes after they opened. They made the orders quickly. The coffee was good but didn't live up to the hype. Don't plan on stopping here in the morning if you're in a rush.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I had a hot vanilla bean latte, loved it! I'm a coffee lover, so definitely recommend it. The coffee has a nice flavor and aftertaste and is not super sweet like you would find in most places. My friend had the 'Best drink ever' coffee which is Americano+vanilla cream and that was really good too if you need that coffee punch and less creaminess than a latte. Their regular coffee size is actually a medium and so is good enough quantity-wise. Rates are between 5-6$ for espresso drinks.<//text>< Response>

<Text>Asked if wanted avocado on sandwich ordered. Asked how much extra, they said $1.00. I said sure. Got receipt before sandwich. Noticed they charged $1.75 on receipt for that slice of avo. Asked them to confirm he quoted me $1.00 for it. He said he could take it off and refund the difference. I told him forget it but told him quotes are expected to be right. Of course no tip. Plus management will see this. Did not notice a price list for extras on their board there. It's the principal. You don't see an extra quoted so you get a firm quote that was admitted. Then it's different. Breakfast sandwich  $9.37 out the drivethru.< /Text>< pictures>

In the sense of ordering your coffee and food, this place is pretty traditional. You order your items at the counter and grab a number and a table (if you're dining in). The only bummer is that you have to pick up your coffee but it's not that big of a deal, I just wish I was made aware to pick up the coffee - especially since they give you a number. The food was delivered to the table though.

I ordered the Honey Latte which was BOMB! The Vanilla Latte was good too.

We also tried the Avocado Toast with Feta- it came on a thick slice of bread. I loved it. I thought it was hearty and healthy.

I definitely plan on coming back here again. I hear the Matcha Latte is amazing too.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Anytime I can avoid a national chain brand, I’m willing to try a local coffee shop. Not only do they have wonderful breakfast choices, they have wonderful coffee.

I ordered B.B.A.B. almond butter, bacon and banana sandwich which was made on hearty bread. My husband ordered 3 Seed Avocado toast. Both were freshly made and delicious.

I generally drink straight black coffee but was tempted by the “Best coffee drink ever” made with Buzz’s vanilla sugar. It had a wonderful touch of sweetness, not sugary.

My husband had two different blends – both delicious. We took one of them home

If you enjoy artisanal coffee, Buzz is a great place to skip your daily Starbucks for.<//text>

<text>Walked over here this morning from my friends apartment. Very cute coffee shop, got a delicious nitro cold brew with a splash of oat milk x 2. The order came up very quickly & the cashier was very sweet.

They are closed for dinning and entering the space due to COVID-19. Cute covid decor, the cashier offered me a free avocado toast & it was delicious.

They also have a drive thru which is pretty rad!< /text>< Time>

Like I think I've been here a dozen times and have never found parking anywhere nearby.

There is a drive-through though so that's what makes it 4 stars.  If you can find parking and get inside it's super cute and cozy and the staff are always very very friendly.

Love the coffee, everything is good.  But the blended mocha mint is a must and I love the Black Lavender Tea with vanilla powder.

YUMMMM.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>First time here; went through the drive thru, drive thru was small/short, so some people were backed up on the street. It was around 1230-1 when we went, the wait didn't take long, maybe a whole 3 mins. The people that took orders were nice, they were standing outside, kinda like how In and Out Burger/Chick-fil-A do it. I ordered the dragon smoothie, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste, very fresh, sweetened only with whatever was in the smothie, cold, and light and fruity tasting. They give paper straws here, so that was cool. Next time I come here I will try the lavender tea latte, iced, its probably really good. My bf had the hot coffee, best drink ever; I tried it and it was very good, I'm not a big coffee drinker either, but there was sugar and cream/milk in this one but it was light and you could taste the coffee, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I saw some bad reviews of this place but honestly, my first time here and it was perfect service and our order was right, so maybe it was just a bad day for the other customers who complained about the customer service. I would highly recommend this place, there are a lot of options to choose from.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Awful place. Wish I could give zero stars and get my money back. Nitro cold brew isn't nitro; it's just cold brew, and bad cold brew at that. Smoothie was too thick and needed a spoon. Never again.<//review>

This location is a bit tricky. It is better for you to drive through the neighborhood to be sure you can access the drive-through. "No Left Turns" ⬅️ (When you go, you'll see what I mean.)
So, when you go be ready to be patient (or go inside) but the staff is friendly and the coffee is delicious!
Breakfast is also awesome!< /review>

They separate trash and recycling which is great to see as well. I got a mocha (my signature specialty drink), but it kind of just tasted like chocolate milk. It was not bad, but I would have liked it much more if it has a stronger espresso taste. The food is good as well, I got a Ham Brioche Breakfast sandwich and I recommend it.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Staff is not knowledgeable -at all- about coffee or their products, but they have fun personalities. Put your coffee snootiness behind yourself, and just order what sounds good. My fav.? The Honey Latte.< /Text>

<review>One of the better coffee places in San Diego as far as coffee goes. This location is small and sometimes difficult to get in to park. The parking lot can be accessed just south of the building on Roscrans, otherwise you have to wait for the drive thu to get in. The drive thru is full most of the time but they move people along pretty quick.
The coffee is great. Not sure where they get the baked good from for all their locations but the quality is good.</review>< Pictures>

Coffee that revives your morning. Very tasty. Their breakfast sandwiches are good too. I would recommend their honey latte and B.A.B.B sandwich.</Text>

The traffic and layout of getting in this place is a nightmare. I'm surprised the city hasn't stepped in. The wait and hassle is not worth it.<//Review>

<Review>Better buzz coffee was great, I attended the place with some of my extended family of 10 and they were super accommodating! They had seats for us and a wonderful staff. You could tell the place was popular because of the drive thru line that went through the street! I ordered a white mocha and it was exquisite. I'm definitely going to come back soon</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Decent place to grab a coffee and some breakfast.  There is usually a line and the staff does their best to get people through.  As this business expands to more locations the quick friendly service people come to expect takes a dip into the negative.  Best cup of coffee and OG açaí bowl don’t disappoint though.<//text>

I’m on the west coast for the week visiting my son and his family. He just took me to Better Buzz for a coffee. It was one of the best coffees I’ve had in a long time. Need to find out how to open one of these on the east coast.</text>

Highly unattentive staff. If they care so much for their brand's image one would at least like expect to receive 3 beverages inside a bag to avoid spills inside a moving vehicle. Starbucks and McDonald's provide bags.</Review>

<Text>Cute place, decent coffee. Too bad the parking and the service is terrible. Literally 5 people stood around and looked everywhere except the front register where myself and another customer were waiting. The girl who "waited" on me kept walking away before I could even ask for a receipt (turns out she left the iPad in mid-transaction, making me think she was looking to add on her own tip after I left,) and then left / ignored the register again before I could ask for the code to the bathroom (with the other customer still waiting behind me.) Another girl finally helped me out -  kudos to her - but the whole experience does not make me eager to return, at least to the Rosecrans location.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< userid>

The coffee is usually great and the employees are always friendly, but the service has become increasingly slower in the last 6 months.
I just went over for a coffee at 630a. The lobby was empty, there were only two cars in the drive-thru, and I counted 7 employees. If there was a manager there, they weren't taking charge of anything. It took 15 minutes to get my coffee! When I went back to the register and asked where my coffee was, everyone was confused and then scattered. No one apologized or said they'd make it. There was silence and had to wait another 5min. How do you forget an order when it's the only one?!
You lost a regular today. Get your act together.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I absolutely loved this place but they are falling fast. Lately, they have been slacking on everything, slow service, drinks aren't blended or are watered down. Today was the last straw, I paid $8 for a acai bowl which are typically wonderful. Today was the first time I felt ripped off!!! The bowl is about a 1/3 of it's normal size. I brought it up to the girl at the window and she just laughed. I will no longer be going to Better Buzz, I tried and tried with you guys. Oh yeah Better Buzz in Pacific Beach might be the worst of all. Sorry but not sorry.

You won’t regret it! Super friendly staff too and very accommodating! 5 stars all round!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80deaba46b8e0563:0x67806f0915c364b2<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Oh my goodness what a great place! The coffee is fantastic as well as the food. The breakfast sandwiches are terrific and the acaii bowls are freshly made. My personal favorite is the hippie bowl with almond butter :) the best thing to do after getting a coffee and sandwich is to go to shelter island and enjoy them by the bay< /Text>

Well, I met someone there to discuss a business opportunity. While I was waiting for her another very interesting couple from Long Beach bought me a cup of coffee. My first trip there was a lot of fun and there's definitely a better buzz. There was a line of cars all the way around the corner waiting to get in the Drive-Thru . I recommend walking on a Saturday morning. The coffee was fantastic and so were the puppies. Thank you better buzz. I will be back.< /Review>

<text>Went here for breakfast this morning with my husband, I loved it! We got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and the peanut butter, maple lattes. They had so many gluten free goodies and gluten free bread which was great! The prices were very reasonable at around $6 a sandwich. I will be back to try the Acai bowls which looked amazing!!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

This was one of the best coffees I have ever had in my whole life! Its not expensive and the crew is so friendly! The place was full with people hanging out and if there was more locations, they would put Starbucks out of business in a heartbeat!<//review>

Wow!! Coconut Buzz is SO good! Being that it’s my first time here I was scared to leave the comfort of Starbucks, but I am so glad I tried this place out. The coconut buzz drink is dangerously good. I’m sensitive to caffeine, so we’ll see how this works out 🤣</review>

This was my first ever Better Buzz location. Delicious drinks. I enjoy the açaí bowls and avocado toast often. 😊❤️

Small interior and sometimes difficult to find parking but great vibe, cute patio area if it’s unoccupied. They sell shirts and other memorabilia with super cute sayings ex: “Life Is Better Buzzed.”< /text>

When it first open it was great! However past couple times I've gone the Best Drink Ever always tastes different and today was awful! Mind you I usually go every morning before work at 5 am and after today I think I will  be going elsewhere.< /Review>

This place was a great discovery in Point Loma! As a coffee addict, I was impressed by their coffee and they have a lot of variety. I was also very happy to discover that they have a drive thru so I can swing in on my way to work. Also, their customer service was top notch! Always had a smile and the place has a great vibe. When I get a chance, I will actually go inside and spend some time there. So far, I have loved all the coffee I have ordered there.< /Text>

Good coffee, but slightly overpriced. The issue is the lines can get pretty bad and are practically unbearable in the morning. Otherwise the staff is super friendly and it has a very local feel while still remaining super consistent. #nostraws< /Text>

My wife loves the coffee here. She swears by the snickerdoodle latte. The place is small, always crowded, and they aren't very fast. Parking is a joke, and the drive thru line goes a bit down the street. But that's a testament to the coffee!<//Review>

< Review>
The nicest baristas and the most delicious coffee chain in southern California. They remembered me even after I had been away for a couple of weeks. They are super knowledgeable about the menu and everyone working there is just so happy.</Review>

<Review>Coffee: awesome. Breakfast sandwich: awesome. everyone that know this place thinks it's awesome too, so get ready for that drive-thru line to go out to the street. Close-quarters parking lot and drive-thru line. It's worth it tho.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>108156819450937749718< /userid><Time>1560567871151</Time>< response>

Every time has been a good experience. I love that they open up early (5am). Never any attitude. Music is a tad loud, so bring headphones if you need to concentrate on work, etc.</Review>

Very shocked at how low quality the food was at this place. On my 1st and last visit my boyfriend and I ordered 2 different things to eat off the menu and 2 drinks. The total $$ was surprisingly the same as a night out to dinner for the two of us. However, before we actually tasted the food we assumed the prices were high because of the fresh/quality ingredients. In other words, "worth the money spent." Sadly, we were wrong and were extremely disappointed. It reminded me of cheap Dunkin' Donuts food but of course with a carefully chosen disguise. Nothing but pure deceit in this establishment.</text>

< Review>
It was not good. Long wait to order, despite there being no one in line. Then there were no tables inside available,  so we went outside. There was an umbrella which kept blowing so the sun shone on us. Then we had to wait 15 minutes to get our order. As I left,  there was a sharp metal edge on the corner of the table which tore my new dress. I will not be returning</Review>

<Review>Good coffee/breakfast sandwiches. LOUSY parking and access. Drive thru BLOCKS street. 29Aug2020/0730 RUDE! Cashier/Server/barista  yelled at me when I partially opened a door (it was NOT locked) to ask a question from 35-40’ away. I did NOT walk in! I realize times are difficult. A second employee met me at a side entrance, behind a plexiglass barrier and answered my questions about ordering. I thanked her. Took my business elsewhere. Will NOT RETURN. 👎🏽<//Review>< pictures>

I had a choice between Best Buzz Coffee  and Starbucks  since it's down the street. I decided to go to a true local coffeehouse. I ordered the island acai bowl. YUMMY!  My husband ordered the oatmeal. He was impressed that it was still hot. BBC is cute and quaint. The customer service is fantastic. The line was long; however, it went quickly.< /Text>

<text>Love their Honey Latte and Mocha gives me life. Their ham brioche and avocado toast are my favorite breakfast item. Unfortunately the manager is rude and did not want to make my managers drink the way she likes it even though she is completely ok with extra charges and he came at me when I ordered her drink and said this is the last time he would do it this way for her because of that she will never return
And my trips have been sparce.</text>< Name>

This place is amazing. I could leave it at that, and feel like I did my review justice, but there is one thing I would like to add. Bravo to whoever designs your look. If you take a picture of your items in the coffee house, it looks as if you set up a professional photo shoot. The tables, napkins, walls, coffee cups, and the floor among other things, have an extreme amount of detail and substance to them. Its really unlike any other place. You will not be disappointed.</text>

Unfortunately, we had one really bad morning, when our food was never made, and when we asked, they looked at us like we were crazy people.  They brought it out a little over 5 minutes after that. I understand mistakes, but they just didn't seem to care all that much, or they didn't express that care very well.</Review>< Pics>

Luckily the name is not 'better taste' because they would be sued for false advertising.
Cappuccino was made too hot, I went directly to westbean after this to get a decent coffee.
Nice try better buzz, better luck next time... Oh wait... There won't be a next time.<//text>

I had such an amazing visit at Better Buzz! The atmosphere was hip and relaxed. It kinda felt like home. My barista was Brandon. He was kind, polite, and went out of his way to make sure that my order was to my satisfaction. I highly recommend this coffee shop if you're ever in the Point Loma area.</Text>

Great coffee!  Killer Bee will kick it into high gear and the Honey Latte is perfect for when you need something warm and soothing.  They are always very nice at the window and the drinks are spectacular! This is kind of a crappy location to pull into but, all the trouble to get in line is worth it here!  Very delicious!</text>

I'm not actually a coffee drinker, so I'm not the best person to review this. But when I do come here with my girlfriend, who is a coffee snob, I find the staff to be really great. They are always in a good mood and always seem to care about your drink. The breakfast sandwiches are really good and my girlfriend finds their avacado toast to die for. I always enjoy a red bull peach smoothie as an alternative pick me up.< /Review>

< Review>
Stopped by after a long week after gettng used to short weeks during the holidays. Ordered the bacon sandwich without the bacon, but rather than just stopping there the guy blew my mind by offering me some avocado and tomato on there. So I was like yes that's awesome, load it up and I'll get a cappuccino too. My sandwich was filled with fresh avocado and delicious tomato and the cappuccino was great. The guy working there was extremely nice. The menu is awesome and they use cage free eggs and compostable containers. Everything I want from a coffee shop.</Review>

The lines may be long at times, but the coffee and the service are certainly worth it. I haven't had a single thing I haven't loved. I highly recommend the best drink better, iced.<//text>

The bacon breakfast sandwich is one of my favorites. Good coffee drinks. The drive-thru is slow and backs up onto the street when it's busy, which is pretty annoying. Overall it's got good coffee and breakfast, and the service has vastly improved over the past year< /text>

Passing by at 6:45 AM. Clients seem to be male, older or on their way to work. Noisy to order, but pleasant staff, though busy with drive through (only one parking space and that's for disabled), so you wait, and wait. There is only one person to make what you want. Beware, they put your cup inside another so its not too hot to hold, rather than give you a slip on, only trouble is that its difficult to get the plastic top off if you want to add cream or non fat milk, sugar etc.. A small is a medium in most places, and much the same price. In my opinion the coffee is nothing special to taste.<//Review>

<text>Giving it 3 stars because of the service and the food. The drinks are either watered down or too sweet. If you have to go there I recommend the iced best drink ever and if you like Starbucks, you'll probably like this too. But it's not fine craft coffee.<//text>< pictures>

If you're still going to Starbucks, you're missing out! Better Buzz is way way better than Starbucks, and I honestly enjoy them more than any coffee shop here. Their coffee and food is so great!<//Text>

I visited numerous coffee shops in throughout San Diego and this place was by far the best coffee I had in the city. Customer service was impeccable and the espresso was delicious. Better Buzz Coffee is definitely my new favorite coffee shop in San Diego.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< user_id>

Great little coffee shop near the San Diego airport. Food and coffee are delicious, and there are plenty of electricity ports so you can easily spend a day working, eating, and drinking coffee here! The porch is also nice, but small, so hard to get a seat there.< /review>

The quality of the items I ordered was okay, but the service needs improvement. There were many employees working behind the counter and not many customers inside waiting, but the wait was very long. Their main focus is getting the orders out quickly for the drive thru and the customers inside are secondary. If they fix this, I would come back.< /Text>

Staff was incredibly rude. So much so that I can't even tell you about the quality of the food or drinks because I walked out so that the server would not sprain his neck from holding his head at such an awkward angle in order to look down his nose at me. (I'm about a foot and a half taller than the server was).
Apparently they have such a problem with homeless people abusing the complementary creamer and sugar that paying customers are routinely asked to leave upon using the creamer and sugar, much to their embarrassment.
Nice way to start off the day right?  Buying a cup of coffee and then being asked to leave after being mistaken for homeless.  Not coming back here ever.< /text>

<Review>Not at all impressed.  I don't know if I just had a one-off of not so great coffee but beyond that, the atmosphere is not that great, pricing is about 50% too high for the quality and the staff seems rather aloof.  So first off...the coffee.  I got the Bold blend and it tasted so watered down I wondered if it was Burger King or McDonalds coffee.  I sipped on it for a bit and then finally having to accept the fact that it was just terrible coffee, I chucked it into the garbage on my way into Target about 15 minutes later.  $3.50 in the trash can.  Oh well.  Live and learn. Literally, take the most average coffee you've ever had and cut it in half with water...that's what it tasted like.  Price....$3.50 for what was about a 16oz coffee?  This is why Panera exists.  You want good coffee?  Either go down the street to a place called Jennings House Cafe (no, I don't work there...their coffee is legit), Panera or Dunkin Donuts if you must.  This Better Buzz place is just completely overpriced.
Atmosphere...obnoxiously loud.  Staff banging on cookware and just generally not very welcoming and friendly.  Forget about trying to have a meeting of any kind there.  You'll be yelling across the table at your acquaintance due to the loud music, staff banging the cookware and just the overall loud ambiance of the place.  I guess I gave it two stars for whatever reason. Probably deserves one....if even.  Owners must be making an absolute killing at those prices.<//Review></record>

They are so over run and they have a small drive through that backs up 20+ minutes into the small street. If you want to get coffee and you're on a schedule stay away but if you have the time it might be worth it<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Tasty drinks (though definitely on the sweet side) and tasty snacks with gluten-free options.  Great atmosphere too. Will definitely be back!</Review>

<Review>Definitely my favorite local roaster and Coffee Spot. Super friendly staff. Super dog friendly drive-thru with snacks for the pooch.

Great coffee here and the service is excellent!  Lines are long though but that's not their fault, it just goes to show how good they are f people are willing to wait a bit longer for their caffeine fix.</review>

We did a road trip from Wenatchee, WA to San Diego, CA.  Finding great coffee was not as easy as I thought it would be.  I was relieved that my husband found this place.</Text>

I wanted to see what the "buzz" was all about so I decided to check it out.  It tasted like regular iced coffee to me.  I didn't think was all that different from a Starbucks, but maybe I am just ignorant.< /review>

<review>REALLY good tasting smooth coffee, not-so-sugary blended drinks. The Mocha Buzz is probably the creamiest drink I've ever had...kinda like a Frappuccino, but 100% better. No artificial chemical taste, actually tastes like coffee. Depends on who makes it though - other times it's tasted like nothing more than a shake. Also enjoyed the latte. For the around the same prices as their competitor, the drink sizes are pretty big I think: 16oz and 20oz. Another thing I noticed is that the drive thru speaker is the absolute clearest I've ever heard; it's like you're talking to the barista in person.</review><userid>118021768743735550938</userid><date>1461856176336</date></record>

Like a lot of places that have drive up windows they ignore their in-store customers.  They have a gaggle of employees standing around doing nothing, while I wait 10 minutes for my coffee after I ordered.  Worst of all espresso just ordinary.  Nope, won't be a regular.</text>

Good coffee, great chocolate scone and a wonderful barista - he was so upbeat and friendly that we didn't mind waiting a bit longer to be served. Limited seating though, given the sea of students parked throughout the shop with laptops.<//text>

Coffee and food is mediocre for how much it costs. One star because their drive thru is a public safety issue. I don’t know how this place hasn’t been fined for causing a traffic jam 5-10 hours each day.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Nice cup of coffee, but I think $ 3.75 for an espresso is ridiculous.

<review>(Translated by Google) A very popular place in the area of ​​scrap point. There is an opportunity to buy coffee, tea, snacks. There is a car service line where you can make and receive your order without leaving your car. The parking is very small and not yet convenient, because in order to get to it you need to stand in line.

(Original)
Очень популярное место в районе поинт лома. Есть возможность купить кофе, чай, перекусы. Есть линия обслуживания автомобилей где вы можете не выходя из машину сделать и получить свой заказ. Парковка очень маленькая и еще не удобная так как что бы на нее попасть вам нужно отстоять очередь.</review><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>
