First time to The Shell. Most impressive… May not be Sydney but it is San Diego. Acoustics are awesome. Layout is perfect; even the picnic area where you bring in your own seats are very well laid out. Walk around areas are free and if you have own yacht you can enjoy from the water. I recommend without reservation…<//review>

Amazing venue for the San Diego Symphony.  Beautiful lighting and world class acoustics. We had a table for 4 with food service at the table. Listening to a Symphony Orchestra doesn't get better than this.< /review>

Amazing concert acoustics with beautiful views of the harbor and downtown.  Projections around the perimeter of the shell help tell stories in a subtle way without being a distraction.  Only wish seating was pitched a but more to allow for better viewing of the stage.  Turf is comfortable and spacious for extended shows.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Incredibly beautiful, and the acoustics were spectacular. We went on the opening weekend and the food service was a bit disorganised, but it tasted good and you can beat the location! If you have a wheelchair I recommend calling the box office to reserve your tickets. There was some confusion with handicapped seating because the online seat map did not match some of the actual wheelchair/companion seating.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsdYHm-FiMkTlSaRkkzf6seOccJu47XKRpuZsD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Attended the opening night symphony!!  WOW. The sound is amazing; the seating is good.  The big screens show certain sections of the orchestra at a time or the whole stage.  The graphics were phenomenal and totally unexpected. As you can tell it wasn't just the person I was with that made it a great evening.</text>

Finally! A permanent structure for the San Diego Symphony.  State of the art design. Great audio and video and not the mention the screen projector!
Clean and permanent restrooms, great food vendors. Comfortable seating and great table for bigger groups</Text>

What have been the choices for big name entertainment? Sports Arena (the throwback of the 60s), Amphitheater close to the Mexican border,  Elitists at Humphreys or Indian Casinos?
I saw Gladys Knight opening weekend... not a bad seat at the entire venue.
Thanks to all that provided the time, money and effort in making San Diego a great place for entertainment.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

We attended a Comedy show here and we bought tickets in the last row. $130 each ticket.  We couldn't see anything if we sat down.  We had to stand for 90% of the show. The slope at the back needs some work to be more enjoyable to view the stage.<//review>

The grounds and Shell are magnificent!  The entertainment and performers were superb!  But the seating was horrendous and uncomfortable.  Add sub-par food at outrageous prices and the charm of what was a pleasant entertainment experience was obliterated.<//text>

Excellent concert venue, beautiful setting, event staff is extremely friendly and helpful, the food we purchased was excellent, small portions and a little pricey, traffic control for pedestrians and automobiles exiting was not handled well. Other than how long it took to leave the venue, it's an excellent place to see a performance.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>The Shell - is the new permanent location for the San Diego Symphony's Summer Pops Concerts. It is schedule to open in 2021 - after Covid. This is such a great outdoor setting right by the Bay. The concert series has a wide variety of talent. Watch out for special fireworks shows and a lazer-light show during ComicCon.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlV-qX8U4ZEEnXod5ln7cgUMhQOwME733kqw_v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm5LnubWeirIDDQtCg2UoZC4knoKIPlvTHHLgA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
The three stars I am offering up are mainly for the construction crews who did a fantastic job throughout the project. These guys kicked hiney and I spent enough time very near their location to see them actually building this structure for several months. Diligent and professional as they could be and friendly as passer-byes with their inquisiting minds passed by. I'm looking forward to returning here to see something in person.

When they were installed the lighting system I remember thinking as I looked in that direction it seemed as if the sun rose and set in succession again and again at night as they programmed it to function like it was supposed to.  It was
very neat to see something like that coming to life.

My best wishes for this venue and it's upcoming events!  During this time or I should say phase of our health consciousness, it will do good to see something bring happiness and joy to those who visit and not to mention it's fantastic location on the bay.

Visited before the August 13 Troupe Vertigo performance. Most beautiful venue in this country! San Diego has outdone itself again. Acoustics we're noticeable from the entrance over 200 feet away.<//text>

I love their donuts. I'm picky about my donuts And this one is perfect, they are NOT grease  but more of the perfect soft fluffy donuts anyone can have. My only problem that I have is that each person chargers you a different price which I hate and I have not said anything because of this pandemic and they are lucky to still be up and running.< /review>

Well,being a bit picky about quality donuts, I was pleasantly surprised that the glazed donuts were probably the best I've ever had. As well as the chocolate buttermilk.....however I'm a stickler for chocolate old fashioned donuts & I've had better,Manleys are good but I've had better. I had a sandwich there too & the priced are like 5-6 dollars. Totally reasonable & tastes descent, but it's the donuts that are the draw.  One thing you have to be ready for is its cash only. When you pull up there's only room for like 2 cars but don't worry, if you go into the parking lot which looks small from the front there's actually plenty of room in the back. It reams a very low key place to grab a quick sandwich on a lunch break & maybe bring some donuts back for your coworkers,lol.<//text>

<text>I wanted to try something new & went to this dumpling house. Ordered 16 pan fried beef dumpling and HOUSE MADE noodles. Both were flavorful and VERY filling. I only finished 1/2 of the noodle bowl & 4 dumplings and took the rest home.

The Restaurant is clean, air conditioned and service was nice.</text>< pictures>

Their Sign said Dumplings house but the actual google map name is Hao Bao Dumplings. Nice and clean environment and open for inside dine in. We ordered the 8pc dumplings and the pork rib noodles also with the taro milk tea. Came out total with almost $27. Decent price for Chinese food. Dumplings and pork ribs is good but the noodle is a little bit too soft.However on the receipt we found out they charged us extra for deep fried which was the lady that recommended to us and never told us will charge extra. I will not give any decision on make a recommendation, it is an average taste but below average experienced.<//Review></record>

I literally woke up in the middle of the night thinking about dumplings and when I shared my quirky craving to my husband, he was quickly on board.
I searched for dumplings and Hao Bao popped up with rave reviews. Initially I saw the midtown location and was bummed they were only open for lunch but when I realized the Stockton Blvd location was open until 6:30pm I hustled out the door to pick up some dumplings!
We walked into a bright and super clean space and were greeted warmly.
Ordering was super easy and fast, and we had our food in hand in 10 minutes. In the car,  the lovely steamy smell of dumplings wafted into my nose and made my mouth water the entire trip.

Our dumplings were tender, moist, and super flavorful. We ordered the pork and beef dumplings (boiled) as well as the house noodles. Everything averaged under $10 and it was so much food we have leftovers for days.

They are very satisfying and affordable and remind me of dumpling houses in SF and Asia.
So if you’re looking for dumplings that are filling and tasty, I recommend Hao Bao!< /Review>

Hao Bao Dumpling is super tasty if you’re looking for dumplings. We bought 16 pieces of pork and chicken dumplings and they came out super tasty. The noodles dish also is good and flavorful. If you can find parking, this place is great and you want dumplings! :)</text>

I love this place! Clean, modern facilities,  and the wait is never long to order or get food. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The prices are very low. I'm sensitive to the food I eat. I came here on a day my stomach was nauseous and upset and I wasn't feeling well. I ordered the steam chicken ( comes with corn inside!) dumplings, with fresh handmade noodles in a soup broth. Even though I  could have been easily turned off by taste, gotten or queasy - I felt actually better after eating!</Text>

First time here and I love it! I shared a 16 piece of pan fried chicken dumplings with the house sauce and they were delicious. The dumplings were stuffed with meat and full of flavor. Great spot to grab a little lunch. I will definitely be a regular here. Emoji rating= 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤< /Text>

These dumplings are to die for. Great service, clean restuarant, and wonderful decor. Service was fast and for me and my lady the best sauce was the teriyaki sauce mixed with mayonnaise and seaweed. Ww are definitely coming back.<//text>

I've been looking for a replacement ever since Dumpling House in Davis closed down. THIS PLACE IS IT! I love the deep fried dumplings and the prices are not bad at all! 10 out of 10 would bring more friends!<//Text>

<text>I love how the menu is geared towards customization - such a fun concept. I got the pan fried pork dumplings with house sauce, and they were really good. They also have a little self-serve station with soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil, which is great so you can have a variety of sauces.</text><gmapID>0x809ac52fbc1bb371:0x45c92367367b8a60< /gmapID>< Response>

Very cheap compared to many other dumpling places and very good too! Pick between boiled, pan-fried, and deep fried as well as between 3 sauces (chili, house, and sesame). Wasn't a big fan of the chicken, but the pork and beef were great.< /text>

<Review>So happy to find this dumpling house.  Such a great find and nice to have something different.  This place provides good value, good taste, quick service, and its pretty clean in here.  House sauce was the best of the three imho.  Perfect for a quick lunch any day.  I would have posted some photos of the food but we devoured it.  I wish this restaurant much success and I hope it’s around for a loooong time.<//Review>< pics>

Not the best flavor, this is like the Starbucks of dumpings. They have dipping sauce to mask the lacking flavors. I won’t recommend.< /review>

Really tasty food, and the staff is super friendly. The service was also pretty quick. My husband said he ended up with an upset stomach, but I was fine and really enjoyed the food and different sauces. The prices were also decent. I would go there again.< /Text>

Good for the buck, definitely worth checking out. Simple menu with protein selection of beef, chicken and pork dumplings cooked boiled or pan fried. They make their noodles in house as well.<//Text>

This area is so worthy of 5 stars! I've had this bookmarked on my yelp for the last month and I finally made a decision to make the drive today. I put a phone order half an hour prior to coming. The ladies were so nice on the phone as well as in individual! I ordered the 12 piece hen dumplings and they were to crave. They likewise placed a sweet chili sauce on the side that paired perfectly! I will certainly be returning for the terrific solution, tidy restaurant and also extremely tasty dumplings!</review>

I would definitely recommend the #sesame noodles and Hao Bao Dumplings chicken as they are signature dishes of the restaurant. Our server, Linda, was extremely helpful in menu choices and attentive throughout our visit. Look forward to trying more dishes at Hao Bao Dumplings in the future!<//Review>< Pictures>

The menu is simple, prices are affordable and the dumplings with the house sauce are delicious! This will be a permanent food stop for me when I'm in Sacramento.< /Review>

Came here for lunch today. I just wanted dumplings...

I was greeted as i walked in..  because of covid it is take out or delivery only. They do however have tables outside to sit and eat.

They offer veggie...chicken...beef and pork dumplings...starting at 4.99 for 8 and 7.99 for 16 of one flavor.

House made noodles. 8.99
dumpling soup 8.49 or 8.99..thai tea...ect.

They offer to cook them 3 ways boiled...pan fried or deep fried.

They also have different sauces...teriyaki sauce...sesame or house which is kind of like spicy goyza sauce...they are all so good...

I ordered 16 pork dumplings to eat for lunch. I had them pan fried. 7.99.

I loved them so much...that i then ordered 50 frozen dumplings to take home with all 3 sauces.

I have not tried anything else here...but based on these alone...i would come back. Just wonderful.

If you are looking for catering...frozen dumplings to take home or just a few for lunch...you will not regret eating here😀😀😀😀< /text>

It's funny how things go sometimes...I was looking to get a bahn mi at Duk Huong but had my dog and didn't want to leave him in the car. While I was trying to figure out where to leave him while I went inside, I noticed the new Hao Bao across the way with outside seating! Alright, I can have dumplings...and glad I did! This is a cool little place that keeps it basic with dumplings and a soup with dumplings. Dumplings come with your choice of beef, pork, chicken or veggie, 8 or 16 pieces. Then you choose if you want boiled, pan fried or deep fried. They have 3 sauces to choose, house (sweeter with chilli's), sesame or teriyaki. I got the beef boiled and an order of veggie pan fried. They were really good! Decent amount of flavorful filling.  13 pieces were enough for me (my dog ate 3). 2 thumbs up from me and 2 paws up from Darwin.
We will definitely return!<//Review>

And of course the sweet Thai tea.

<Review>Got a bolt stuck in my tire, removed it and put it in my husband’s car and brought it in to Valenzuelas Tires. Got a high quality used tire at a good price. He even loaded it back in our car.

TLDR: Excellent prices, excellent service, professional work. This is the place to go for any tire related anything, and is now my personal go-to for tires that I would recommend to everyone.

Full review:

I have been to several tire places and this one is the best of the lot without question.

I called ahead to make sure they had what I needed, as the vehicle in question has uncommon tires. There was a short wait while stock was confirmed, and was subsequently pleasantly suprised to hear the not only did they have 4 tires of the correct size, but they were able to undercut their competitions price.

There is no reduction of quality of service and work from the lower price, which is a definite win in my book. It did take longer than one might expect, but that was due to my tires being really wide as well as run-flat tires, which adds a significant degree of difficulty (have done tires myself in the past with a manual tire machine, so have a bit of experience in this area). Despite the difficulty,  the work was done with no complaints and the team of two brothers worked together very well to complete the job to perfection. They realised that the work was taking a while without me saying anything, and proceeded to explain exactly what was going on without any prompting at all, which shows their professionalism and knowledge in action.

After all was said and done, I was told to bring my car right back if there were any issues and they would take care of it. These guys rock!

2 Months Later: As happy now as on day 1; my truck needs tires soon and I know exactly who to call!

7 Months Later: Awesomely epic service, 'nuff said</Review>

<Text>I am pretty car savy and I checked around carefully before buying tires.  I knew I could buy premium tires from Costco for about  $1000.00 with good service and nation wide warranty.  However, I have decided to buy from this local independent dealer. I bought "Lionhart" brand new,  tires were in stock and were installed and computer balanced for $350. The ride is smooth, quiet, and they look like a million bucks. I could buy 3 sets of these for the price of one set from Costco. If you are driving across country or out of state maybe you should buy from a large national company. But if you drive local you can't go wrong with this place.</Text>< username>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>This is my favorite Chinese restaurant!!
The owners are awesome and the food is always made fresh and the ingredients are high quality 👌
Everything I've tried is delicious, I seriously don't eat Chinese food from any where else because it's just not as good.
The combos come with one item, rice /noodles, an eggroll and a drink for under $10
My girlfriend and I usually share a combo and add the salt and pepper fries (french fries with salt pepper and jalapeno) sooo good. They also have salt and pepper wings that are amazing too.
If you're hungry and in covina please check this place out!

$5 minimum for credit cards.

This location no longer serve item selection combos, a la carte only. Pricing is also high for Chinese food standard, $9-10 for a one item combo.

They do not clean their soda machine properly. The soda I was served tastes like cleaning solution and bleach.

The portion is small for the pricing.

The food definitely uses less oil and grease when compared to other Chinese food location, but the flavoring is extremely bland. Everything tastes like water-downed soy sauce. A lot of the natural ingredients are not seasoned properly and have no flavor or just tastes like soy sauce.

For the price you are paying, you are much better off selecting the other Chinese food locations within the area.< /review>

<review>This place is extremely food. I recommend this place to everyone. The staff is extremely friendly. The price is good and you get a good amount of food for your money. I always order the orange chicken, Mongolian beef, chowmein chicken and beef, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice. They are located inside a strip mall. There is plenty of parking if you are looking for a place to park. Inside looks like a normal fast food place.</review></record></dataset><record>

Eating in is probably not ideal, for there are not many hot items to choose from. There are a few staples under the heat lamps, but your best bet would be to grab a menu, order your items ahead of time, and pickup for to-go (or then eat in if you prefer). Food is therefore guaranteed to be cooked to order and all packed ready to go. Otherwise, you could be waiting inside watching deadmau5 shows on the wall-mounted LCD with the owner- which is not bad if you're into house anyways.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Great Chinese Food

I live in Baldwin Park and have been looking for a good authentic Chinese restaurant without having to go all the way to Monterey Park. The food here is really great. They use all fresh ingredients and their soups are very clean and tasty. The restauarant is small but don't let that fool you. I highly recommend this place.</Text>< gmap_id>

<username>Donna Usborne< /username><time>1520394440171<//time><Review>Food is excellent. It is a fast-food type place so you would never guess the food would be this quality and delicious. No nasty chicken with a bunch of gristle here and their shrimp are decently sized and always perfectly cooked.  It is family owed and authentic. Prices are good and portions are adequate. Even their fountain drinks are better than most places. Very clean too. I am picky and cannot see how anyone could rate this low because I have been coming here for years and food is consistently fresh and amazing. My favorites:  War Wonton soup & brocolli with Shrimp. :).

Ultimately ended up throwing it all away and wasting my money and all I wanted was to at least have a mediocre asain meal.</text>< userid>

<text>The wong tong noodle soup is wonderful. I have it with only the wong tong, noodles, green onions and cilantro. They don't use MSG in the broth & it's not greasy or salty. I bring my own sesame seeds, minced garlic & cilantro.</text><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

Love the lunch combo potions.  The brocoli and shrimp is the best. Made to order and so delicious.</text>

food is good but dont eat there unless you rather have a conversation with the owners daughter than with whom ever you there with, she won't shut up and she brags about how rude she can be, other than that the food is good.</Review>

< Review>
Sandwiches end up being $12 for 6 inches of bread and 3 ounces of meat. The small amount of pulled pork was heavily soaked in bbq sauce so I couldn't even taste the smoke flavor, texture was tender otherwise. I'm pretty disappointed, I'd give it another try in a month or so<//Review>

<text>The food is excellent and the staff are super nice. Wish I lived close enough to come back and try more of the food. The tri tip, the garlic bread, and the loaded chicken sandwich were our favorites from what we tried. Great value for the price as well.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Well, now I understand why there's always a huge line outside this place! They have a huge selection of different dogs and beer, so it's the perfect spot to hang out with friends.
The only downside was the long wait to even get into the storefront (about 45 minutes). After ordering, the food came out pretty quickly though. I was so impressed with the mango jalapeño and my friend tried the one with rattlesnake and really liked it. I was so so excited when I saw they had curry ketchup and I knew I had to get fries too.
Definitely check this place out!</Review>

Most of the people rating 4 stars Will fail any psychologist test. It is Either 1 or 5  !! And this place has a 5 star because there is no 100 stars. Amazing food, very polite people, very addictive because of the taste and flavor. Recommend this place all day bravo señores fierrrroooo alv< /Text>

< review>
Pulled pork sandwich needed sauce in my opinion. Althought the pork was nice and shredded and moist. Sides are very small portions its like I was having more a sample from Costco instead of a side. The half sandwich, side, and drink cost me $10. The 1/2 rack of ribs on fridays was delicious though. Has a somewhat great smoke line pulled off bone and good smoke flavor. I would return but try new menu items hopefully I have a better experience next time.</review>

< review>
I just want to begin by saying that this business definitely deserves all the five star ratings.  I asked the owner of this company to cater my father's 75th surprise birthday party two weekends ago.  I had spent many hours online searching nearby locations for good quality caterers and found that they are very hard to come by.  I live in Arizona and was trying to plan his party from a state away.  Parties are already hard to plan, but they are even harder to plan when you are doing it from a different state.

Lets start off with the fact that I picked this company only based off of their reviews and Sean's amazing communication.  Sean called me almost immediately after I sent my email (which I found is rare in this business lately).  Throughout the entire process leading up to the event, he was super easy to get in touch with by phone and email.  He responded to my emails within a day and made the process of making changes to our menu or party size very easy. He was very kind, easy to work with, and understanding.

I usually would taste test food before booking a caterer, but given that I lived so far away, I didn't really have that option.  I was really nervous about hiring a company I had never heard of or tried myself.  However,  I read the reviews, talked my plans over with Sean, and quickly took a leap of faith.  I can't tell you how relieved I was to have this company take over the responsibility of preparing a meal for 60 people.  They definitely did not disappoint.  All the guests were so impressed and said it was the best BBQ food they had ever had.

My brother also called me recently and expressed that guests are still raving about the food two weeks later.  He said that guests keep asking him where we found the caterer and how they can get in touch with him. My father LOVED the food and was so impressed that BBQ catering could be so high quality and tasty.

Most importantly, the food was amazing.  It was very flavorful, the meats were juicy (not dried out), freshly made, and plentiful.  We never ran out of food and people were returning for seconds.  There are many selections of food to choose from and there are even options for vegetarians which you don't really think about in regards to a BBQ.  We chose the ribs, chicken, tri tip, chipotle mac and cheese, fresh green salad, deviled potato salad, mixed grilled veggies, dinner rolls.  I would hire them again in a heartbeat and even have considered one day using them for my wedding!

THANK YOU SEAN and CV BBQ for coming all the way out to help make my Dad's surprise party such a huge success.  He loved it!! You were all so kind and professional, and the food really was impressive.  You have a great business, and I hope you will still be around for future events!!!

I would highly recommend taking a cup of chili to go and save it. The prices are great because the quality of food and the portion sizes are huge.

Place may be small but the menu is big on flavor. Will return and try other items on the menu. Had the tritip sandwich, also try pulled pork quesadilla, cornbread, deviled egg potato salad, taco trio, sliders and of course the tritip beans, everything is GOOD. THE MARF is the greatest addition to the menu!<//Review>

CV BBQ catered our daughter's wedding rehearsal and reception dinners.  They did a fabulous job in the crazy hot temps.  The food was awesome and they were all a pleasure to have at our event.  Sean could not have been better to work with during all of the planning (this was a destination wedding for us so it was all planned from out of town).  Without question they deserve the 5 star rating.  We can't thank you enough for making these meals memorable for us and our guests!!  The food we enjoyed from CV BBQ was definitely a highlight of the weekend.  We hope to be back and enjoy your food again.  Awesome job!</Review>

<Text>We were out of the area arranging a rehearsal dinner for 110 people at an estate in Palm Springs. I was nervous to say the least. Sean, of CV BBQ, answered all my calls immediately over the few months before the actual date, and gave me confidence that all would go fine and the time they would arrive, what to expect etc. They arrived on time to set up and start the BBQing. The BBQ and all the food was amazing! The presentation was elegant and lovely. There were seven servers- all friendly and welcoming! I loved the food (every dish)!  It exceeded all my expectations! I was blown away at the quality of the food, the preparation and the people involved! I would highly recommend CV BBQ! You are crazy not not hire them for any event! One could not ask for more!
Sincerely,
Connie Irwin</Text>< resp>

What an amazing experience! Sean is beyond professional and always available to answer any questions you may have and is extremely accommodating! Everyone at our wedding complemented on how wonderful the food was and how great the service was! They took care of absolutely everything! Set up, appetizers, buffet line and even packaged our food up for us at the end of the night! CVBBQ does not disappoint! Thank you Sean and your team for an amazing and unforgettable evening!</Review>

Sean and his team at CV BBQ are incredible. We recently used them for a rehearsal dinner in Pioneertown, CA. The food was absolutely amazing. The set up and service they provided were great. Sean and crew went out of the way to make the dinner very special and the setup that they provide is clean and professional. Thank you so much for making the dinner great!<//Text>

CV BBQ catered our wedding in Cathedral City and they could not have been more perfect. They are one of the more affordable catering options in the desert and their service and food is fantastic. Everyone raved about the food and we had leftovers for the next 2 days that STILL tasted good. Sean was so helpful during the planning process and always responded promptly. You will not regret hiring CV for your event. We will be visiting their new restaurant every time we go back to the desert. :)</text>

OMG!!! I had the best chicken sandwich I've had since I moved out here from Los Angeles! My son had the brisket and sausage plate, which was also just as delicious, and I'm not a big beef fan! But in my opinion the BBQ beans........are HEAVEN! I could eat them as a meal! Everyday. For the rest of my life.

Just remember to get there early if you want pork (which was my first choice), it was gone by lunchtime when we went!

Hands down it's worth making it there, even with their limited hours!<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>My wife and I booked CV BBQ for our wedding of 130 guests and wow! we could not have been happier. The food was amazing: the hardcore BBQ enthusiasts were effusive in their praise, comparing it to their longtime favorites (Franklin BBQ, et al), while everyone else, even the vegetarians, found a lot to enjoy. The staff were all extremely friendly and efficient. We didn't even notice the clean-up, it all happened so quickly and quietly. They also didn't ding us with any hidden charges or fees, everything was above board. Love these guys, I will definitely recommend them for other events at our place.< /review>< pictures>

We invited Sean and CVBBQ to cater our St. Patrick's Day wedding ... what a day!
First of all, Sean worked with us on our back and forth guest numbers and adjusted the contract without a gripe!  Sean was prompt in all communications and gave me a sigh of relief as we planned things.
The crew came on time, food was ready as scheduled and the team was really cool considering the agenda was a little behind planned.  Sean was also cool with us having an outside vendor bring in lechon!
The food was amazing (central coast style trip tip!), and the service was incredible!
I am jealous...Sean has a cool thing going! :)
We recommend CVBBQ for all of your catered events!<//Review>

Today’s my second time going to C.V. BBQ and I must admit, they are an extra special treat in the Coachella Valley. I’ve been known to jump into my Car and drive for miles for some good “Q”. But now, I only have to drive down the street. Today, I had the Chicken, Pulled Pork, Sausage (gratis, complements of the Owner) and Tri-Tip and I also had the Mac & Cheese and Corn. What an amazing meal, I’m still full. The Chicken was moist and flavorful. The Pulled Pork was absolutely amazing, well-seasoned and cooked to perfection. The Sausage was huge with flavors and just the right bite of spice. The Tri-Tip was to die for! Cooked perfectly and also well-seasoned. All of the meats were cooked and seasoned so well, that sauce wasn’t needed but it was a value add bonus. The Corn and Mac & Cheese were also on point. I was so happy with my Meal…. After my meal, I had a chance to chat with the Owner (Shaun and his Wife). Very nice people. We chatted about his Santa Maria style of cooking his Meats and Shaun was nice enough to let me sample the Chicken Quesadilla and the Taco’s. Thank you again Shaun!!! The Staff is also very friendly, and the Owners are very, very special! If you are ever in the Downtown Indio area on Monday & Wednesday during Lunch, make C.V. BBQ a priority! Call first to verify the hours...</review>

< Review>
It seems that weddings are defined--for better or worse, for richer or poorer--by their food. In that regard, CV BBQ helped make my wedding a success.

Pretty early on my now-wife and I decided that our wedding had to be nice but not fussy. Like a backyard dinner party but elevated. She being from Santa Barbara, tri-tip was one of the early options for the dinner menu. After finding CV BBQ here on Yelp we quickly made contact with Sean, who was responsive and friendly from start to finish. (This, I came to realize, is a rare thing in the wedding planning world.) Suffice it to say that our mid-week trip to Palm Springs for a tasting was well worth it and we booked Sean's company without ever trying another caterer. It was affordable, fit our criteria, and most importantly delicious.

Tri-tip, chicken, mac and cheese, potato salad, kale Caesar salad (a slight modification to their normal Caesar salad) and grilled mixed vegetables: ordered!

Come wedding day, the smell of grilled meats were wafting across the venue and I'd like to think that it made the whole ceremony all that more enjoyable. And as I stood ready to gorge myself on food I heard someone yell, "Congratulations, David!" It was Sean of CV BBQ, standing in the middle of the service line alongside his employees. Now, it's hard to make well-rounded judgments on a person through such few interactions but when you see the boss standing alongside his people, that's saying a whole hell of a lot. Not only about the pride he has in his company but also in his staff and in his food.

But enough about all that. How was the food?! The tri-tip was obviously the star. Cooked medium and sliced thin, there was no more left by the end of the night. I wish I'd had more of it looking back but I was so nervous about the first dance that I didn't want to over-stuff myself and get sick all over the dance floor. The chicken, unlike most others, was exceedingly moist probably because they use dark meat instead of over-hyped white meat. Sean and his staff used baby kale for the Caesar and it was probably much more enjoyable for everyone when compared to the tougher adult kale. But I think what I was most impressed by were the vegetables considering vegetables and vegetarian options are often overlooked at wedding meals. These were smoky, still firm and even included pineapple to help add acid and flavor.

I cannot stress enough how helpful and kind CV BBQ was during our whole ceremony. People kept coming up to me to say how nice the catering staff and bartenders (hired through CV BBQ) were. Of course, it was quickly followed up with something to the effect of "...and the food was SO GOOD!"

Thank you, Sean and company, for making our day special and delicious.< /Review>

If you're thinking of serving traditional cold chicken and sad iceberg salads at your wedding...don't. CV BBQ was such a wonderful highlight for our intimate wedding in Yucca Valley late February. We were planning from Michigan and the process couldn't have been easier.

We thought we wanted a family style dinner, but the cost of other vendors we researched was so steep for a group of 20 and the response times were usually lacking. From my first email with Sean he was so responsive and helpful. We knew we all love a good BBQ and heard CV BBQ brought an elevated experience, so we had no concerns with booking without a tasting.

On our wedding day the scent of tri-tip, ribs, and grilled chicken wafting over the property was incredible. The staff was so friendly and the food stayed hot! I wasn't sure what to expect for the buffet table, but the presentation looked great.

THE FOOD
Let's just say I'm glad my dress was stretchy. I think I ate no less than 10 ribs and a pile of tri-tip. We subbed kale for the lettuce in the caesar salad and I loved it because I felt like I was at least eating some vegetables. (I was just trying to stay warm with meat sweats tbh). The mashed potatoes were creamy and amazing.

Our friends and family LOVED the food as much as we did. We still hear about it. My mouth is watering thinking about it. Imagine a tasty backyard BBQ memory then imagine if it was even better - that's CV BBQ.

We realized afterward that the team didn't get their gratuity so we sent it along a couple of weeks ago (so sorry!) If you're planning a no-fuss, destination wedding or just want really really good food...book them! Thank you so much Sean and team for an incredible wedding dinner.< /Text>

<review>We had the pleasure of having CV BBQ cater our wedding 2 weeks ago in Palm Springs. Everyone at our wedding told us repeatedly how DELICIOUS the food was. Most people went for seconds, and that's how you know they are genuinely impressed. It was buffet style but Sean, the owner, personally plated the bride and groom's plates with loads of deliciousness. His staffs and bartenders are friendly and professional as well. We could not have been happier with the food and service.

Let's be honest, most guests don't remember the food of weddings because they are usually blend, mediocre and not filling. We had the option of choosing one of the caterers that provided fancy dishes and Hors d'oeuvres we couldn't pronounce, but we are so glad to have gone with CV BBQ. They use top notch ingredients to produce unpretentious and simply delicious food.

If you're considering between CV BBQ or another standard plated course meal place, look no further, go with CV BBQ! And be sure to order more of the ribs than you think people will want, because they will want more! The tri-tip (they slice in front of you) and chicken were divine as well, but everyone wanted more of the ribs for seconds so we ran out of them. The mac-n-cheese, mushrooms and mashed potatoes compliment the meats so well and are great options for vegetarian guests.

Sean is the most personable and solution-oriented person to work with. Every wedding will run through challenges. The entire time I felt like I had Sean's full support and commitment to solve problems together. He was flexible enough to work around my venue's restrictions and my last minute change of services without complaining. Everything went without a hitch in our eyes. Both my husband and I applaud his work ethic.

Last but not least, Sean allows you to bring your own liquor as a lot of caterers would rather charge you the premium on alcohol. We were able to rent 2 bartenders from CV BBQ and all the staff members to pass around appetizers and pour water and wine during the dinner. On top of Sean's very reasonable price for food, it saved us a lot of money to bring our own drinks.

You are in for a serious treat if you go with CV BBQ! Good luck!< /review>< name>

<Text>Sean and his staff at CVBBQ are beyond AMAZING!

We hired CVBBQ for our wedding reception and could not be happier. We were late to book a caterer, so when we called CVBBQ, they were already scheduled for that weekend. Luckily, the couple who booked  them for their wedding decided to change their date and Sean called us back to see if we had found a caterer yet. We hadn't and jumped at the chance! All of their reviews are stellar and we really wanted some good ol' BBQ. We were not disappointed! They arrived on time and put together a beautiful set up with no instruction. We got compliment after compliment from our guests. and the staff was super friendly and very professional. After dinner they picked up empty plates and set aside our (party rental) cloth napkins. They even packaged the leftover food up and put it in our fridge. We literally had to do nothing! We had also hired bartenders through Sean and they were awesome too! Very friendly and fast and made our signature drinks delicious! While I was getting a drink, the bartender overheard me talking to my mom about when we should move the cake table to the reception area. Without missing a beat, he said, show me where the table is, I'll move it for you, and he did! I honestly cannot say enough great things about this company! We will definitely be using them again for our next big party. Thank you, thank you!< /Text>< pictures>

If you are looking for juicy, light, crispy, tender, flavorful fried chicken that packs a great heat, you have come to the right place! Main Chick has one of the best fried chickens in this area, and I am pleasantly surprised by my order. It has all the greatness of traditional fried chicken, but minus the excessive fat. The chicken is perfect, and spice level 4 is THE match for me (be ware, it's really hot). The seasoning on the fries is right on point, and the house sauce is perfect for the chicken and the fries.
My only suggestion is that the slider bun and the slaw is a bit underwhelming, with such a flavor packed chicken you need a stronger slaw, either in sourness or texture.< /review>

This place is the bomb and quickly becoming a favorite for anyone in the area that knows good chicken. I've been in here a number of times and they are always rockin. The staff is nice, patient and quick with the order. The style of service is easy and a much needed addition to this strip of restaurants beside the theater. Great new spot with a great staff that I am sure will do well.<//Review>

We have quite a few places in San Diego that serves fried chicken, but this is one of my favorite. They have five different levels of spiciness, and they cook the chicken just perfectly. It is crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist and juicy inside.<//Review>

<Review>Pretty good. Chicken was crispy and juicy, sweet bun was a nice combo vs a traditional bun, toasted bun, seasoning on crinkle fries was nice touch a hint of lime imo. The medium was not spicy at all so i have no idea why my friend and waitress said it was that is opinionated though.<//Review>< pictures>

I saw an article about Main Chick opening up a location down here and had to come by. Never been to one before but friends had mentioned them being amazing up in Pasadena. All I can say is...More Please!!

I got the Combo #1 which comes with 1 chicken strip with a pickle slice on top, 1 chicken sandwich a small container of MC sauce and fries. They give about 5 options I believe for spice level and I'm a bit of a spice wimp so I chose mild and thank heavens I did as even their mild is on the hot side for my taste but delicious nonetheless.
My order came by quickly, only bout 5 min or so wait time and the lady at the register opened the box up to show everything was in there which, considering everything is to go right now, was a nice customer service touch.
I tried the fries first, which were nice and thick with just enough seasoning. The MC sauce really gave them an extra kick though; truly a delicious unique flavor. The chicken strip had a ton of dry rub seasoning on it which I love but was also nice hot and juicy on the inside, so good! I then tried the sandwich and devoured that in 3 or 4 bites, enough said haha.
If I could give one critique I'd say the cardboard box it came in had a lot of likely grease stains on it, not the most pleasant thing to see but that was it.
Great customer service, great taste, will definitely be back again.</Text>

<Review>NEXT LEVEL. Best chicken sandwich we’ve tried so far. The perfect amount of crisp and crunch to it, fluffy buns, tangy pickle, mm. And do not get me started on their sauce!! Finish off with their French fries (which are notorious for not traveling well but somehow their do!??), perfect cut, fantastic accompaniment.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Love this place! The food is so delicious, and fresh. The mild seasoning has a nice amount of spice and flavor, but I'm a pansy and I can still hang. Other highlights include the fries, the mac & cheese, and the ranch! Also the pickles are so good... you know you're in good hands, because even the condiments are delicious. The prices are reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get, and the staff is super sweet! I've been here 3x so far, and I will be back!< /Text><Time>1609547977649</Time>< Pics>

By far the best chicken sandwich I’ve had that lives up to their spice level and flavor.

Recommend to call in your orders ahead of time. We waited until we got there and it was a good 20-30 minutes when she told us 10-15 minutes. There were a lot of phone orders and people coming in to pickup.

Their menu is so simple with five combo choices and a few a la carte choices. Made it so easy to order.

We got combo #3 which was two chicken sandwiches with crinkle cut fries for $15. We got one sandwich mild and the other spicy. We also got one leg quarter $4.50 in medium spice. It all came with Main Chick sauce.

The orders was packed neatly in boxes. When I got home, I opened the leg quarter first and immediately, the medium spice aroma ticketed my nose. That’s how strong it was.

I took a bite of the sandwich and it had the crispy crunchy texture and juicy chicken with all the amazing flavors and perfect amount of spice level. Mild had a slight kick and I could handle medium while spicy would be too much for me.

Due to COVID19, it’s only take out and no dining in or outdoor. Not that much space so only one at a time inside at the counter.

Plenty of parking spaces in this plaza. Located next to the theater and Indian restaurant.<//Text>

I've been searching for some hot chicken to set my life on fire. Finally found it at main chick!! Ordered the 6 piece strip combo on supreme heat (WARNING).  They're some big honkin' strips of chicken. They make you sign a waiver for it, and rightly so because it's no joke. Despite being so spicy it's still got great flavor, which I feel other places lack when they turn up the heat. I ate 4.5 pieces out of 6 and was full off of that and the fries which were also delicious. Saved the last strip for a fantastic spicy salad the next day!</text>

Ordered pickup 3/7/21 ~6:15, arrived  and it wasn't ready (a little later than estimated, no big deal). Asked to wait outside and they'd call my name when ready. Saw several orders get pushed to the side with no call of my name. After 15 min, I go up to them again and ask, and my order is one of the ones that had ls been sitting there...  Tall girl would rather talk about crack houses with her friends who came in to visit her than do her job. Sorry business owner, get better staff, 1 star until then and you've lost a customer.<//text>

<Review>Main Chick Hot Chicken has been open for about a week, so I had to try out this new chicken spot. I ordered combo #2. It has 2 chicken sandwiches and crinkle fries. As far as the spice level, I chose the Spicy level of heat. The hottest level is called Supreme, and it requires a waiver before consuming that one. I would have liked to sample the Supreme before I ordered my food, but the young lady said that it was not possible. I’ve been able to sample sauces at other chicken restaurants, but maybe covid 19 policies has something to do with it. The seasoning of the chicken was spot on. I also enjoyed the sauce that came with the fries. My family enjoyed the chicken tenders and mac and cheese (not pictured). They said that the mac and cheese was creamy and well made. In addition, I would say that the customer service was great. The people that worked there were friendly and helpful. The price point seems to be a bit higher than most places for similar portioned and quality chicken. The location is ideal, so maybe when the adjacent movie theater reopens, there will be more traffic through this area. If you are in the area, try it out! It was a great filling meal for me. Eat up!!!</Review><user_name>James Camacho</user_name>< user>

I am happy to say these folks are no fools. The chicken here is really delicious. I can't handle a ton of hot spice, so I can only attest to the juiciness and flavorfulness of the mild chicken, but the mild is still pretty spicy, so I can only imagine how hot the spicier options are. Try it for yourself!<//Review>< date>

Best chicken sandwich I’ve ever had. Had the Combo #1 with a dark meat sandwich on the side. The flavor, spice level (mild) and tenderness of the sandwiches and tender were absolutely amazing. The fries had a great flavor and overall extremely impressed. We can’t wait to go back< /Review>

Sorry food here was too salty for me...I couldn't finish it.  Also even the mild was too spicy for my wife.  We couldn't taste any difference between mild and medium.</Text>

One of the best fried chicken spots I’ve ever had!! For me, Main Chick BEATS Dave’s hot chicken because I feel like it has more flavor to it.  Also the sauces are amazing as well. Definitely my new favorite hot chicken spot.< /review>

<review>Absolutely one of if not the best chicken sandwich I have Ever had! Came on a whim and for $5.50 you couldn’t beat it, Chick-fil-A is $4.50 so for comparability it is fantastically priced. I got The dark meat and mild heat and it was PERFECT! Add a side of ranch and it’s out of this world.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Name>Makayla Meadow< /Name>< date>

Good food but unbelievably expensive for what you get. Basically every fried chicken place in San Diego is a better value than this one. I miss Chicken Charlie’s.  At least we still have Crack Shack (which is about the same price as this place but much better!)</Text>

<text>Overall, everything was great, the fries were amazing the sauces were good and they really figured out a way to make the spice their own thing with even medium spice sending you running for milk. The only thing was the way they spiced the chicken, it was completely coated in it and it ruined the experience, it was rolling off on my fingers and it felt like I was biting into sand. That was my only issue.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>So addicting! This is already my 4th time coming here  since they opened 2 weeks ago. I highly recommend their dark meat sandwich or leg quarter. I’ve tried so many Nashville hot chicken places in LA and SD but this is the only place that offers dark meat and it’s BOMB! IMO this is by far the best hot chicken in town! I don’t know what other haters are talking about but once u try it you’ll know who’s legit and who’s not!< /Review>< pictures>

The lady was very nice and had good customer service as well. I got spicy and medium. Not the hottest I've ever had but good spice and not grainy and it definitely builds up to a good spicy amount while still being tasty. The sauce is also amazing. The fries were the only meh part. Needed more seasoning and I wish were crunchier. Would recommend.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>I got the Combo #1 in both mild and medium. Both were okay, and heat level was on par with similar places. Portions were a bit small and everything tasted mediocre. Honestly I would rather drive 5-10 minutes away and go to Dave’s Hot Chicken. They taste better and give more food overall. Also I ordered thru Postmates, still had to wait 20 minutes even though “Order is Ready” popped up after waiting 30 minutes already. Prepare to wait even if ordering in person. I might revisit after a few months to reevaluate.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvliT1g0zWuQ1g1EIF72NgzKTr00EJ1e7Eeb08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dc01de09d8e531:0x690af0721c924573< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I got a #1 and mac n cheese. Food was pretty good, maybe 8 out of 10 but way over priced and the portions are not that big. Wont be going back unless they lower their prices significantly.</review>

Delicious food and great service! I used to go to the Carmichael location years ago and had no idea there was another location in Lincoln, very glad we found this one, it was as good as I remember, if not better. Lincoln's best-kept secret!< /Text>

<Review>I purchased Chili Verde and it was not my favorite version of the dish. It wasn't spicy enough for me. Urbano's is near Sun City and the restaurant regulars may not like it spicy. Before I am accused of "ageism," please note that I am a senior myself. Additionally, the meat contained too many chunks of fat that I cared little for. My two companions did like their respective meals. In fairness to the restaurant, I am much more a fan of Southwest food rather than pure Mexican dishes.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo_VKVsdhRMQ5v58ZX_r5BZoIe9di-0s9lL7BU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNL-Z5wmjHAcXm3yP98jjv4rj66RvyCmnnM65FC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<review>This is my family's go to Mexican restaurant. I've had many different items off the menu. I've never had a bad meal here. Staff is always quick and friendly. Plenty of chips and salsa when you arrive. Salsa has a nice zing to it. Drink orders are taken quickly. Orders arrive in a timely manner. Always plenty to eat or even take home.

Urbano's is a clean, typically decorated Mexican restaurant. Spacious, never over crowded, with a nice full bar and plenty of TV's playing sports. Also an outside dining area.

This trip my guest had the 2 burritos combination plate. I opted for my favorite, a special on this night, Pozole. If you never have had it it's like a salsa soup with big chunks of slow cooked pork or chicken in it. Yum.

Urbano's servers it with fresh cabbage, cilantro, lemon wedge, and a bowl of dried oregano. Add the ingredients, give the lemon squeeze, sprinkle the oregano, and bring your taste buds alive. It's a 5 star bowl of soup.l</review>< rate>

Food was fine and so was the service, but was very surprised to see they were allowing indoor dining when our County is in the widespread tier, which doesn't allow indoor dining.  I chose to sit outside where I felt more comfortable.< /text>

Love this place, we are welcomed and feel comfortable here, they treat us like family every time we go. We drive about 25 to 30 minutes just to go eat here occasionally. Their Mexican food is authentic. I absolutely love their chips and salsa!<//Text>

< Review>
This place is a hidden gem. The regular beef tacos are to just die for. They're made with what seems like mildly seasoned pot roast. The cheese is first in the crisply fried shell followed by the generous portion of beef with lettuce and a tomato. It's simple but I'm telling you absolutely delicious! The enchiladas are wonderful! Everything we've had there is VERY bueno!!! Try it...you won't be disappointed!</Review>

Yum yum yum. They have another location in Carmichael that I've been going to for years. I was so excited when I found another in Lincoln closer to home. Their salsa is to die for!<//review>

I am not that picky when it comes to Mexican food, but Taco Bell is better than this place.  The waitress and waiter were very kind but the food was horrible. My friend got a beef quesadilla and it looked like chunks of dog food in a tortilla... I had chicken, and it tasted like it was a very wet version of rotisserie chicken.. I wish the reviews woul be honest or the food would be better.< /Review>

<Review>Plain and bland food. Not restaurant quality. It is the same as just making food at home. Not cheap either. Paid $12 for fajitas which was mostly rice and beans and I didn't even get guacamole. Will not return.<//Review>< pics>

I realize they were busy, but it seemed to take quite some time to get our food, and even then it wasn't that great. The servers were still attentive and kept a positive mood though.< /text>

So I wish people would actually write honest reviews on here because there are none or the owner himself puts up good reviews which is very dishonest, restaurants cannot get better if people do not write an honest review.
My wife and I started out going to this restaurant about 6 months ago, we felt like it was a little hole in the wall so it must be good. the food is mediocre at best it's about the same lines as taco bell and I'm not being picky just honest, there is never anyone in there when we go, maybe a couple or 2 and we always go around dinner time or lunch time.
We give restaurants a fair chance we Try them out 6 times just to give a fair chance 6 out of 6 times food is bland or a way too salty we ordered a chimichanga and when it came out there were 2 miniature chimis they were soft, not crispy no sauce on them just totally not what it should be,Canned pinto beans and mediocre cheese so when you pay $15 for a plate you would expect something at least like the picture even if they charged $25 a plate we would pay it for good food!! I think this place has potential if they would listen but I think it's all about the bottom dollar at this point or they are not making enough money to produce fresh food?< /text>

When ordering I let the server know that I was a vegetarian and wanted a burrito. He suggested a menu item and I took his recommendation.

When I was about halfway through the burrito I found a piece of chicken. When I brought it up to the waiter I got no apology, no desire to get me something else or take it off the bill.

When I explicitly say "I'm a vegetarian" before ordering it's reasonable to expect no meat to be in your dish.< /review>

Food is bland and over priced. Been there 3 times just in case I had one of those unfortunate experience.  But the experience was the same each time.  During the summer (2 of my visits) they don’t use AC on 100+ days. Slow service when I went to place an order to go and not a single person was dinning in.  I can’t say anything positive.  The service was even subpar.< /review>

Service is good here. Warranted a 4 star off of first visit. 1st visit, Chile Colorado good flavor...thought it would have had more Chile heat. 2nd visit, still good service, however not so good food. Ordered Carnitas, identified as house specialty. 1st of all, plate left under the 'salamander' heater too long. Beans dry and caky. Rice browned. But Carnitas were hot. 2nd...Problem:  there was a big 'glob' of fat/connective tissue 'placed' on the plate. I say 'placed' on the plate because it covered a specific section of the plate, as if the cook meant to cover the plate so it looked like a full plate of food as it was a separate chunk of material from the otherwise semi- shredded meat.  It was a disgusting thing to put on the plate. The cook should take more care for something touted as a house specialty. My opinion.</Text>

Horrible!! Ordered a chicken burrito, it was a flour tortilla with chicken and that's all! No beans, no rice, what the heck????  I called them since I ordered food for pick up and they told me if I wanted beans I should have ordered the super burrito, what ???????  Never have I experienced this anywhere, completely confused or maybe they are.</Review>

Ocel worked with us and found us a car we wanted. Also they didn't try to push a car on us that we didn't like . Which I have experienced in the past. Great spot for bad credit or if your looking to build your credit! Exceeded my expectations!</Text>< Pics>

Hands down the best and most amazing experience I have ever had in a customer service experience. They are most humble and down to earth people you will ever encounter. They went out their way to make this possible for me to get. A car and worked through every hurdle and obstacle that came up to help me.< /Text>

<Text>Caesar was super helpful and got us into a car easier than I've ever imagined. They offer the best warranty I've ever heard of, they really have your best interest at heart. I will be recommending Norco Autoland to all my friends and family.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This is the only place that literally sticks to what they say they can help you with bad credit I have been to numerous dealers who said they could help me with bad credit and get me into a car well all of those places don’t wanna work with me any further and wanted at least 5 to 6 grand as a down payment. And the car wasn’t even as new as the one I ended up being able to get here at Norco auto land. The process was quick I started out by looking online and seeing a car that I liked I contacted Cesar that car was no longer available but he worked hard to get me in A 2015 Kia optima fully loaded and worked with me on my down payment. The whole process was quick and smooth and I definitely will be back in six months to upgrade the vehicle thank you for sticking to what you say and helping your customers as much as you can!<//review>

Brandon was awesome! I went to several auto places before this and this was the ONLY one that worked with us. Brandon helped my fiancé renew his license when no one else took the time out to do that. Everyone else just turned us away. I got a really nice car for a small down payment. I would definitely recommend this place! 100 stars! Thank you!</text>

I highly recommend Norco Auto Land !! Not only were they were helpful, very understanding and worked with my credit as well. I also drove off same day with a low down payment and monthly payment I couldn’t be more than happier with how I was treated! Cesar your the best and I really appreciate and thank you for  making it possible to drive off in my own car to build my credit and start somewhere!!< /Review>

<Text>I've been to so many dealers in my life. I've had bad credit for awhile now. Every dealer I went to told me know or would ask for a ridiculous down payment. I came across this dealer and hands down this dealer is the place to go with bad credit! Cesar and Brandon really helped me out and got me in something that was perfect for my family! I highly recommend this dealer.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>107632499714687114947</user_id>< Name>

I didn't think i would be able to get in another car so easily after my repo last year. But thanks to Brandon Roybal, i was able to get into a 2015 honda civic! Brandon is super helpful and will work with you to get you into the vehicle you want! 100% and would buy here again. My car runs perfect and i could not be happier with my experience, Thanks Norco Autoland!</text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcc9dc82db0039:0x1305b5251a0818fb< /Gmap_id><review>Can not recommend this dealership enough Caesar and the team above and beyond to help me get the car that I actually wanted a 2015 dodge challenger every dealership always wanted more money down and more money on monthly payments but the team at norco autoland literally just asked "what do you want to pay" and they got it done the banks approved me for the exact amount I wanted for both down payment and monthly payments. They also helped me find the lowest insurance while still having full coverage, I am so grateful to them my credit wasn't the best at all I am actually rebuilding it right now with the help of Caesar and I didn't have very much to put down and they still made it happen plus it was incredibly quick I drove away in my challenger in under two hours of being at the dealership no haggling no fighting for a better price, they take care of you like you're family.
To anyone who is looking for a new car I definitely recommend this place made my life so much easier.
Thank you to Caesar and the team you guys made my year!< /review></record>

<review>I went to Norco Autoland Sat and Brandon was nothing short of amazing. He got me in a vehicle I like with decent payments even though I have damaged credit and co signed on another car loan. I had gone to someone else and was told no. I'm very impressed and grateful norco autoland got me in a vehicle I love. I would recommend.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dcc9dc82db0039:0x1305b5251a0818fb<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

< Review>
They show vehicles on their web site to draw you in, yet when you get to the lot, they tell you that the vehicle sold the day before. They then proceed to try to put you a car of their choosing. I had four specific cars in mind that I spoke to the salesmen about before I arrived. What were the possibilities that 3 of the 4 would be sold before I got there. And the 4th I was told was also sold yet there it sat on the lot. 500 down, lies! They want at minimum 1500. If you are desperate, and no where else to go, I still would not go there.<//Review>

They thoroughly explained all the options and what the $500 down was based on. It's refreshing when car dealers are honest and not just out to take you money and get a fast sale. I recommended Norco Autoland to anyone looking for a good honest deal with people who car. Be and stay safe.<//Text>< Pictures>

Helped me find a perfect car for work and even where able to find an extremely low insurance. After the purchase of the car, two weeks later i got a call from them letting me know that they found a lower APR and lower monthly payments. They went out of their way to find a better deal even after i had already purchased the car. This is an amzing place to buy a car and they help a lot even when your credit isnt that great.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Norco Autoland is the best dealership I have ever encountered. I completed the online application and the next day I received a text with the information to contact Caesar. Caesar help me through my whole process with purchasing my vehicle. Caesar was very helpful and understanding and took my needs into consideration with getting me the perfect vehicle for me. The warranty is Amazing and the payment was under what I said my Max could be. Caesar also worked with me due to the COVID-19 and my Job being Limited two transportation he was able to deliver my car and the Final paperwork with no issues. I will be a customer with them for many years to come. I will be referring all my family and friends to them. Thank you so much for everything.</Review>

After experiencing such a hard time everywhere else in getting a car with below perfect credit, Cesar got me a fantastic deal! He really worked with the bank and vouched for me to get me into my new car today! I’m really very appreciative of the help I received! Everyone there was so nice and I will never forget the help that I received from Cesar today! Top notch! I recommend that if you’re looking to buy a car and are looking for great service and an amazing deal, please make this one of your stops! They’ll treat you right. Make sure to ask for Cesar! Thank you so much!</Text>

This was my first time buying a vehicle through a dealer. I had bad credit and was just starting to get back on my feet. Cesar and Erik completely understood my situation and work late into the evening with me and guess what, I drove off in a 2013 Toyota Camry! I whole heartedly recommend everyone reading this stop by their lot, and I’m sure you would not be disappointed!</text>

<Review>Man really awesome workers. They were very helpful in getting me my first car! I would really recommend coming to them to get a car. The whole process lasted about an hour. Really fast and simple to get a great car! Really good customer service. Shout out to Eddie and Cesar for helping get my first car and to Ramon for detailing my headlights. They look brand new! Last but not least shout out to Ricky for my wheel lock.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

ASK FOR CESAR. I came here after I was rejected by some trash spot called BPautosales. Guy wouldn't even give me the time of day. Came here not expecting much really but was immediately helped by Cesar. Super helpful and honest guy. He's not pushy or just trying to make the sale. After our test drive we talked numbers and he was willing to be flexible with the amount I had to put down and was able to get me approved and financed on an amazing car WITH ZERO PROBLEMS. if I needed to buy another car id definitely come back here and I'd definitely ask for cesar. Andrew was also very helpful showing me three different car reports instead of just the carfax. IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CAR AMD YOURE A SERIOUS BUYER DEFINITELY PUT THIS SPOT AS ONE IF YOUR FIRST STOPS.<//Review>

<review>I just went to norco autoland to look for car because I have really bad credit.  Thought that I would never be able to get financing for a vehicle. But brandon really helped through this process getting me into a 2017 chevy Malibu. And the extended warranty for the life of the loan . There is no dealership offering that. So big ups to brandon and aric who really made this experience very easy for me . I recommend anybody looking for a car Norco autoland is your first and last stop on that journey.

After going to a couple dealerships and getting denied, I found Norco Autoland as a advertisement on Facebook. I filled out the online application and got a phone call from Cesar within minutes. He was able to get me approved over the phone. I went in and test drove my new car and filled out paperwork. I was in and out in less than 2 hours with the keys to my new car!!! Cesar made everything happen when other dealerships said no, and he made it the easiest car buying experience ever! I highly recommend Cesar and Norco Autoland. They are friendly, easy to deal with and polite.< /review>

Great experiences. This team helped me find a car within my price range and worked on a deal with the auto leaner. This place might be small but its very professional and clean.  The staff doesn't pressure on making a deal and they explain everything in detail. They also worked around my schedule to show me their inventory.< /Review>

<review>We filled out the online app and was super skeptical because we have had bad luck with dealerships before. Eric assured us we were in good hands and we were!! It was the best experience by far! They answered all our questions, and got us AND my daughter approved and we all drove off the same day! We had a great inventory to choose from, very honest and forthright. I didn’t feel jacked around by “salespeople”. Best experience for my daughters first car also!!</review>< username>

Brandon and Aric really made buying my first car a great, hassle free experience! They are both extremely friendly and understanding of all situations that may come up, and are more than willing to help and accommodate. I highly recommend buying froM Norco Autoland to anyone in search of a great, used vehicle!</review>

I went here to get a car yesterday. They have amazing service. Very friendly not pushy and defiantly try to get the best deal for you. The owner came and introduced himself. He seemed like a really good guy and the guy that was helping me with my car Cesar was also really nice. They sure do make you feel comfortable!! I really recommend going here!!</Text>

I had the best car buying experience here! Caesar was really knowledgeable and made my first time car buying experience easy! He walked me through everything and was really trying to help me not just be concerned about money. He was genuinely trying to see what car fit me. I couldn’t be happier with my car. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.<//Text>

Not like so many other dealerships where they are pushy and just want to make a sale, they really want you to be happy and get what you want here. The car I liked had a chip in the windshield, Eddie assured me if they could not get someone to fix it in a timely manner that I could get it fixed and send them the bill. The customer service is amazing and Ramy, the owner, lets you know he cares about the service and experience more than just the sale, they want you to come back and tell your friends. I highly recommend if you looking for a good used car</review>< Pictures>

Our family of 7 needed something more comfortable and bigger ! We both have your typical younger couple terrible credit and I even had a repo on my report and Cesar made it ALL possible for us! We love our vehicle not only is it a great vehicle it’s well priced within our price range. Best customer service! Thank you 🙏</review>

Let me tell you about time at Norco auto land, coming here with bad credit is perfect for anyone they helped me get into a very nice Kia with low miles. I have also told my friends and they all got cars from here with low down payments and the lowest car payments a month.</Review>

<review>My boyfriend and I came due to a referral from a friend. We worked with everyone there but the owner Ramy was personable and genuine. He spoke to us as human beings and didn’t treat us as another “sale.” Needless to say it was a no haggling car buying experience. I would refer anyone here and come back again. Thank you for a wonderful car buying experience.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I have bad credit and Repos on my credit and these guys are still way more then helpful. Ceasar was super helpful owner is super cool. When no one at all gave me a shot these guys stepped in and got me into a car. Other places wanted 50% down because of my credit but they are here to help everyone with a second chance. Not only to rebuild your credit but to get you and your family into a better car. Norco AutoLand is the place to go if highly recommend anyone to come here, I am super happy with my new car and happy I got another chance at owning a newer car. Thank you Ceasar!!!! And thanK you Norco AutoLand!!!!</Review>< user_id>

This is a great place to buy a car. Great service and professional I really understood everything I was getting myself into. I have to say Mr Uri Alcantar is a great sales person he took his time to explain everything we needed to know about our buy but also very polite. You will never regret coming here.<//review>

I came to this dealer with 1,000 they helped me out get a car that’s was perfect for my family and the payments were super affordable. They had an outstanding team ready to help with any questions I had about my car loan and what type of vehicle service I’ll have. This dealer is the one though I’d go to again and let my family know to go here as well. Thank you norco autoland!<//review>

Great customer service. They really work with you to get you into a car that you will really like. I left with a 2016 Kia in near perfect condition the monthly payments are really affordable if you need a car and don’t have the best credit they will work with you to get you financed. Best experience I have ever had going to a car dealership.</text>

<Text>My husband and I just purchased a Subaru WRX from here. We were helped by Cesar, Rami and Aric, all of whom were excellent. We have been searching for this specific car for several years, but none have been up to the standards my husband holds and within the price range that we could afford. Aric worked with him and got him approved, something all other places would not do. Jack finally got the car of his dreams and it's because they were willing to take a chance on him. Thank you for everything guys, we will definitely be back to purchase my truck in the next year or two!!!<//Text><GmapID>0x80dcc9dc82db0039:0x1305b5251a0818fb<//GmapID><response>None</response><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

I was working with Christopher here at Norco Autoland and was very happy with how he worked with us. I really felt well taken care of and attended to. All my phone calls and texts were also promptly returned, and that in and of itself is refreshing. I'd recommend them.<//Review>

I had a great experience here and bought a beautiful 2014 Toyota Corolla LE echo. Everyone was very friendly and treated my husband and I wonderfully. Chris was fast and prompt and we were out of the door in under two hours! Ramy was able to talk with multiple banks to find us the best deal and lowest monthly payments. Highly recommend this place!< /Text>

<Text>The owner appeared to be very nice at first. However, this change very quickly when we began to ask questions about the car and he saw my mom had a car scanner that checks for codes. He immediately told us he wouldn't sell us the car anymore. He is extremely rude. We would have bought the car too if he wasnt so rude.<//Text>< name>

<review>My husband and I had the absolute best experience with his car dealership! Came to check out a car we saw on the internet and were completely blown away! The service was excellent and the process was so fast. We’ve purchased many cars before at dealerships or private owners but nothing beat this company. So honest in be pricing of the vehicles. Worked with us while we were financing and met with the perfect bank! So happy we came to Norco AutoLand and you should come too! The used cars look brand new inside and out. All car fax and well taken care of, the full tank of gas was a plus too!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Where do I begin , I was a little skeptical about buying from a small dealer.  Dayshawn was very helpful throughout the entire process from texting me numbers, and explaining down payments to being able to work with my low FICO score. Thank you ARIC for the quick an easy approval an closing the deal.! 2nd day with my vehicle and I love it ! One other thing that stood out to me they let me browse through the cars without feeling pushed an obligated. GREAT JOB AUTOLAND!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>I never write reviews and I am going to be completely honest with this one.  I bought a 2010 Toyota Corolla from Norco Autoland a couple of days ago.  This was my first purchase from a small car dealership and I had my worries because it was small and there are stories about getting ripped off by these small dealerships.  That was not the case. It was hands down the best experience I have ever had purchasing a car.  I have bought about 5 cars off big dealerships in the last 15 years and always felt rushed and pressure.  Norco Autoland had no pressure and Christopher was open and honest about dealing with my challenging credit score and gave me options again with no pressure.  Ed helped me with checking the cars out and found the best fit for me.  It came in at the monthly payment I wanted and Christopher even saved me some percentage on the finance rate. - love that!  I would say that the most striking part about the whole purchase was the way that Christopher walked me through the contract to make sure I understood all the charges and details so I knew what I was getting into.  Love you guys!  Thanks a lot for getting me a very nice car. I love it!  The icing on the cake was the 250 dollars gift card after the purchase.  That came in handy.  You guys went far and beyond to help me get the car.  I will recommend you to anyone I know that want to buy a good used car.

Friendly staff and accommodating to all needs. Great low low prices. Check the out before choosing someone else. You might save a bundle and invest in the warranty to boot. This is good place for people who need a car no matter what. They fought for me and even took me home along with my bicycle. They want to help in any way they can and won't tell you false things.<//Review>

<text>Recently my 2011 Mercedes ml350 while parked , was totaled. Having to search for a replacement car suddenly was difficult. I searched online the five western states, drove hours everyday in search of a good value replacement car. Then I went to Norco Autoland and met Ramy.  Based on his understandings of my needs and price range , I knew I had found my next car. And bought it! Buying from  Ramy and Norco Autoland was a pleasure.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

These guys are great to work with.  They are friendly, and easy to work with.  They have a great selection of vehicles, and they show you all the information about the car (carfax, dmv record, etc.).  I would definately recommend and buy from here again!!</text>

I tried to negotiate a lower price and was told they need to make a $4000 profit margin to stay open. Wow.

Very dishonest people! Bought a truck from them with a warranty and already had to get new transmission and differential withing a year of purchasing vehicle. They sold me a warranty that won't cover anything because they sold me a truck with a lift kit on it and warranty company won't pay for anything because of lift kit... Very Disappointed in this company< /Text>

<Review>Tasty and a bit salty. Online order through the website was hassle free and straightforward. We stopped by their entrance in our car and the host delivered the food to us around the promised time. I will come back for the fried chicken but I hope there'll be an option to request a less salty version. The "small" bucket had seven pieces and it was more than enough for 3 of us. Another person in our group got the lobster roll and they were pretty happy too!</Review><Response>None< /Response><name>Tara Hashemi<//name><GmapID>0x808455552180442f:0xe83fe9a08580d371< /GmapID><Rating>4</Rating><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_OLoC2B6KzgeFMhSlmqrDcsC9e_EfLgXnb4CF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUndK04FI6a0in0iibV2gLn0eHDsDH7fkHS4Jq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp1KgR3Uk3_otodM6MyVU4iCddTzOzUNfCF2Wm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< time>

They have the crispiest fried chicken. Our lunch reservation at another place fell through due to COVID health order and we had to figure out a place to celebrate my friend's birthday. Addendum had outdoor dining at their picnic tables so we each enjoyed a lobster roll and shared a fried chicken lunch. The lobster roll had nice big chunks of lobster and the bread was perfectly toasted and buttery.</text>

<text>Only open during Summer where you can get a bucket of Thomas Keller fried chicken or some ribs. It's the best fried chicken in California.

The sides are pretty small and just okay. You go to Addendum to devour some amazing chicken and enjoy summer in Yountville.<//text><time>1533416975471<//time>< GmapID>

<Text>Food:
Their fried chicken is their signature food. The ribs are also delicious! The Cole slaw is gross. The macaroni salad is okay. The corn bread is good. Could be a little bit sweeter. Make sure you bring your own water.

Service:
Service is okay. They hand you their food. They keep the area pretty clean. The food is delivered from the front building to the back.

Seating:
Lots of benches, but the place can get very pack. There is grass for picnic if you choose to sit on the ground.

This is easily some of the best fried chicken on the west coast, maybe even any coast. I've had this a few times now and its been consistently juicy with the perfect amount of crunch and seasoning, they've got this down to a science. The venue is beautiful and when the weather is nice, maybe the perfect picnic spot. It can get crowded at times so we often order our food in advance, but the crowds flow in and out pretty quickly. I can't recommend this place enough.<//review>

<Text>Wow. This fried chicken will change your life. Well, not really but it's really good fried chicken! if you want this amazing fried chicken you have to call and reserve ahead of time. Fortunately my friend is smart and planned ahead. There is outdoor seating during covid-19. But you can also find somewhere at a nearby park to eat it. The fried chicken is just so darn good! I was underwhelmed by the side dishes. So don't bother with those. Also the lemonade is way too sweet. So just stick with the chicken!!<//Text><user_name>Karen Rosenthal</user_name><user>105533993063220712481< /user></record>

Such a beautiful garden and great fried chicken. Just be aware there’s only one bathroom for the entire garden, so there can be quite a line.<//text>

Basically:

Fried chicken is excellent
Ribs though, too dry, don't order
Coleslaw is soooooooo sour OMG 👎
Macaroni salad normal like supermarket food
Lobster roll good amount of lobster but nothing to call home about

So all in all just load up on the fried chicken and go, save your money for alcohol.

You're welcome.< /Review>

Delicious fried chicken. Cornbread was like a little cake, loved it. Side change on a (daily?) basis. Bring a bottle of wine, grab a picnic table, and enjoy one of the coolest spots in town.< /review>

Do the call ahead order. Don’t worry about finding a table, there’s plenty of seats in shade and sun, and the turnover is fast.<//Review>

<Review>Delicious fried chicken. Very courteous staff who help open wine bottles for you and give you plenty of water. Really well cooked Ribs (not overly cooked) that rip off the bone. Plenty of seating, no corkage fee, and outdoors.

All-in-all, a WIN.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>The best of the best! Thomas Keller fried chicken, pulled pork sandwiches and baby back ribs all of the highest caliber! If you are looking to experience an easy way to grub on Thomas Keller food this is it!

usually only open between Thursday through Saturday and sometimes on Sunday depending on the season, they can get very busy so I recommend ordering online. They do have picnic tables on site and A convenient stop for a quick bite to eat... But again make sure you order in advance online!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The ribs were, IMO, the better of the two. The ribs were tender and juicy with just the right amount of smokiness. The atmosphere was very chill. A really good place to take a break from wine tasting and recharge.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Always a great fav place for lunch. Simple online ordering, pickup was a breeze. Delicious juicy, marinated fried chicken. Their lemonade is pretty good too. Picnic at one of their provided benches. Shades provided, either by umbrella or under the canopy of trees. Only 1 restroom. The lines can get long.
This yard can be rented out for private events. Plenty of herbs which I'm sure TK's restaurant in Napa go to find their herbs.< /Review>

<review>Freshly fried, hot, juicy fried chickens are great! The corn breads are fluffy and less sweet than normal ones. It has a bunch of picnic tables and a lawn area for open seating. It has a relaxing, almost Farmer market like vibe. Great place! But check the hours before going since it's not open daily!<//review>< pictures>

<text>Some of the best fried chicken I've had. I had the opportunity to try this when a friend hosted their wedding reception here. (I know. What a freaking treat.) Best. Wedding Food. Ever. It's so yummy that I ask to come up here multiple times throughout the year. I'm not much a drinker so when I ask the husband to come up here, I offer to be DD as long as I get to stop here for some fried chicken and cornbread.

The backyard (literally) is a very casual place to grab lunch with some friends on a warm day. This past weekend when we went they had TEMPORARILY relocated to a vacant building down the street so they could accommodate guests during the colder months. GENIUS.

I haven't been to any fried chicken mecca but this place has some of the best fried chicken. The skin is crispy and flavorful but not overpowering. The chicken is juicy and tender. It's deliciousness. It's a little on the pricey-er side so prepare to shell out as you'll want to try everything.

This past weekend they had a lobster roll that we decided to try and it was good. It's expensive but it tasted good. The price point is like the crab sandwich at AT&T park but significantly tastes better.

If you don't have a reservation anywhere in Yountville and looking for something a little low-key - I highly recommend this spot.

The Pro-Tip if you know your schedule - order ahead online, especially if it's a warm busy weekend.</text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

People rave about the fried chickrn, which is wonderful. But the ribs are delightful. A great place to have a casual lunch. But be forewarned, it is $$$. Water runs 3.50, and thinks go up from there. Don't go if you are concerned about money and cheap.<//Review>

Best fried chicken breast, ever. I typically ignore chicken breasts. Even if I get them I throw then away. These turn out to be divine. Pulled pork was excellent, but the fried chicken was da bomb.< /Review>

<Review>Order online people!!! And just waltz right in to get your order. No waiting around. When you've planned out the wineries and dinner but forget about lunch? This place!

So I found out about the down low on the lobster rolls, they are only for the holidays. So if you find yourself in the vicinity, I would place that order, be it for snack or lunch or picnic, what have you. You're welcome!

We always get the fried chicken. We've been picking up the BFC buckets. My guess is it means that it's either aka Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Bouchon Fried Chicken, Best Fried Chicken, Bougie Fried Chicken... lol

Let's just say we've had better ribs, and don't say I didn't warn you.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I am so happy with their fried chicken eating it once a week (Thursday-Sunday).  Somehow the kitchen staff was able to put together the recipe I grew up with, so it makes me very happy.< /text>

Wow! Experience this famous fried chicken from Addendum  without having to fall in line for reservation, eat to one Thomas Keller Resto here at Napa Valley--  scrumptious, finger-licking goodness – picnic tables under the trees makes it  more enjoyable meal with family and friends.< /text>

Excellent fried chicken.  This is a great place to pick up an quick boxed lunch.  We tried all the options and the fried chicken stole the show. You can bring your own wine, there is no fee if you open yourself and have cups.  There are several picnic tables onsite.<//text>

Best fried chicken I've ever had!  I'm a few pounds heavier after our vacation to Napa thanks to this place lol.  Wait isn't too bad and the food comes out quickly.  Pretty garden seating with shared tables.< /Text>

Unfortunately, the likelihood of a long wait and lukewarm chicken is high from my experience, even when on a theoretically less busy weekday. Even at it's best, Addendum fried chicken is not the best I've ever had. However, their cornbread is fabulously tasty, buttery, and near-perfect. I'll certainly come back, but it'll be for that.</Text>< response>

Excellent Fried Chicken, fantastic crunch, Rosemary and sea salt were a nice touch. The sides could have been a little better (but they are sides, not the main dish).</text>

If I could give it no stars I would. Mainly cause I didn't get to eat anything thanks to their poor service! For 10 people, we ordered a bunch of food, and of the food that we ordered, they didnt bring out half of it and instead continued to charge us and bring out the food we didn't order/didnt want! FYI - if you dont have it, just tell us, and we can order ourselves an alternative instead!
For a French Laundry fanatic and a person who is in love with the Napa food and service, this was our worst meal and a huge disappointment for all 10 of us. Never again.

P.S. remove the lazy, cant-wait-to-leave kids that work the premise</Text>

Great food.   Stand up and sit outside.  But was very upset with the music that was coming through the outdoor speakers.  Perhaps I am older, but I am not used to f-bombs being blasted out at a restaurant.  I would not bring my grand children here.< /Review>

<Review>- open during limited days and hours so check the schedule before visiting
- I've always wanted to try the ribs but the chicken is so good that I don't even bother
- the chicken is so juicy and the skin is super crispy
- I had 1 piece that was a bit pink but the staff explained that it was fully cooked and since the chicken is fresh (killed that morning) that it is normal for it to run pink in juice and not clear/gray. They insured me that I wouldn't get sick so I ate it - it was delicious and I didn't get sick.</Review>< Pics>

Had the buttermilk chicken, macaroni and pea salad.  Nothing wrong with anything but hardly remarkable. BF had the pulled pork sandwich and was of the same opinion.< /review>

<Review>Place you order online ahead of time to avoid waiting in line!  I had done that for a Saturday afternoon pickup and my food was ready at the pickup window right then.  We ordered both the chicken and the bbq lunch.  The chicken was incredibly crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside, a true winner.  The bbq was just as delicious.  The ribs were one of the best I’ve had.  The sides of mac salad and coleslaw were less impressive but not horrible.  The weather was sunny so the outdoor dining area was a perfect setting for us to chow down on this yummy meal.< /Review><username>Elaine Mau< /username><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x808455552180442f:0xe83fe9a08580d371</Gmap_id>< userid>

Behind AD HOC restaurant building And their in back parking lot, in the Redwood garden outdoors, only 11a-2p today Saturday, with a line, with very limited parking, so you may want to park the car at the big Village 1877 minimall parking lot, a block up on opposite side of the street. Yountville super-crowded for an April weekend !! Adequate parking is a huge Summer weekend problem.

Tan box of 2 pieces extra crispy, small round soft cornbread, paper lidded container of spicy slaw, poker chip size cc cookie, utensils napkin and 2 handiwipes.  E.C.Chicken crust was delish, but one thigh bone was bloody; Hongry ,,,ate anyway. Yep, still kickin'.
That never happens at KFC.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Delicious! This was my first and best meal in Napa. We picked up a fried chicken lunch box and enjoyed a picnic lunch at Clos du Val. I love my fried chicken and Addendum does fried chicken very well. Well seasoned batter and moist meat. The lunch box included several pieces of fried chicken (plenty to share), corn bread, cole slaw and pasta salad. The honey cornbread was how I like cornbread - dense and not too sweet.

You also have the option of ordering the lunch boxes ahead of time online to ensure there's a meal reserved for you. Their online system worked well and we skipped the line of people who did not have a reservation.

We didn't eat there, but there is plenty of outdoor seating. The ambiance outside is pleasant. There's a mini garden, benches, trees for shade, and grass areas to sit. Great place to spend a day in beautiful weather.<//Review>< pics>

<name>Walter Macalma< /name><date>1445993404310</date><rating>3</rating><Text>Thomas Keller, the Kingpin of Yountville’s version of a food truck this fast food shack has no inkling of Americana, Fine Dining. It’s an entire fast food joint built upon his signature dish. “Buttermilk Fried Chicken”. You could order in person and wait an hour or order online and it will be ready somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes from ordering. Walk me down from the wine country oh modern man.

Oh golden delicious battered and deep fried chicken you are so moist and crunchy. It was strange to see they offering buckets a la KFC/Popeyes style. If you took Willie Mae’s and combined with Hatti B’s spice this is what you get.

Somewhere selling Fried chicken, ribs, cornbread, cookies and changing sides is pretty much southern BBQ, not something loosely connected in ownership to FL. This review is easy.

The chicken is still very good, but due to bulk and since it’s fast food you lose a little something in the quality because lets face it even if you eat out the box as you walk to the benches it’s nothing like getting it plated and garnished just for you. Here there is a dozen people’s orders in behind you, straight up assembly line style.

Seeing the menu you would think someone in the staff has a grandmother from the south that could have shown them how to properly make cornbread. It’s dry, lacking sweetness of fresh corn, it’s small. Regardless of the sides that 1 piece and 2 more sides is not worth it. Honestly you should just get the chicken. It’s a catastrophy with the side dishes, again as if 3 people each made 1 side and the portions were laughable. I myself, or someone I know beats each of his side dishes every day of the week and twice on Sunday. I take it back that this is southern BBQ anywhere else, nope this is an insult to BBQ side dishes. It makes sense when your waiting hours for to smoke your meats low and slow, why not perfect the side dishes here. Ice tea was basic. Potato salad had no zing, cole slaw had no contrast. You should have never tried to make pulled pork, now your really getting into that BBQ realm which puts a whole new category of criticism going up against my specialty palate, but I’ll take it easy on that. low and slow or don't do it at all, do the pig some justice will ya. The cookie was about 250% overpriced.

The service is chaotic, but the scenery is nice, seeing as it’s not a restaurant and just a shack. I thought that Ad Hoc gave Thomas Keller and FL a bad name, but Addendum give ad hoc a bad name. This guy is hitching himself to the wrong horse post FL. Nominal value seeing as a large bucket cost near $50 and

To be fair the chicken beats most fried chicken on the west coast. Thomas Keller you went from Michelin master to jack of all trades master of none.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>The chicken is delicious as many say but when you spend $50 on a bucket and half the chicken is uncooked and bloody is really disappointing I did text them but I haven't got a response yet and it just about ruined our picnic for out-of-town guests<//Review><UserId.>107534816616999942472<//UserId.><gmapID>0x808455552180442f:0xe83fe9a08580d371<//gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) It was the most delicious chicken I've ever eaten in America
It was good to enter rosemary

(Original)
미국에서 먹은 치킨중에 제일 맛있었어요 굿굿
로즈마리 들어가서 좋았습니다</text>

I normally love Kitchen Mouse, but recently ordered two sides of potatoes ($4 each) with my order. When I got the order, it was a hilariously small amount of potatoes. I don’t think it would have amounted to one potato for both of the orders. But I’d spent $8. It was slightly ridiculous. Luckily the breakfast sandwich was super good!< /Text>

Kitchen Mouse is a vegetarian restaurant and it's my new favorite spot! Sometimes it does get crowded cause their food is SO good. The servers are super chill and the ambiance is pretty cool too. Parking is kinda hard though.<//Review>

We love Kitchen Mouse! We’ve been going for years. Now, during the pandemic, we’re trying to support them by doing curbside pick up. They’re doing a great job of managing the orders and keeping their customers happy.<//text>

<text>I ordered an OJ and pats corned beef hash which came with eggs to your liking, some potatoes and your choice of toast (chose the sourdough, obviously). All in all a perfectly good breakfast, healthy portions. The sourdough toast was really good but I couldn't finish all four pieces. The eggs were cooked pretty spot on (over easy). I think the potatoes would have been better off a little more well done.</text>< Pics>

<review>Kitchen Mouse is a vegetarian restaurant on 59th avenue and Fig. Atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. Interior decor resembles your own kitchen house with accented lights and classic dinner tables/chairs. Similarly, it is well organized, neat and lots of natural light. Outdoor seats are available albeit very limited. Prices are a bit on the high end for HP neighborhood. They accept cash and credit/debit card. Staff are friendly and professional. On a busy day, service can be slow and long lines. You need to order first before you take a table. We ordered their three stacks House Pancakes, made of oat, buckwheat, and corn flour with blue berries/strawberries, toasted coconut and maple syrup; and two scrambled eggs. Pancakes were flavorful and fluffy and thick; the eggs are perfectly cooked and their coffee was just good. Overall, if you like veggie breakfast KM is the place to be.< /review>< gmapID>

Amazing hide away a block away from the hustle and bustle of Wilshire. The pastry selection is good and the calm atmosphere and lighting makes this place an ideal spot to study. Coffee is great too! I wish I had stopped here years ago.<//Text>

<Review>Got the breakfast tacos, added the salsa roja & avocado. The food was fantastic! It's on the pricier side (approximately $15 with the add-ons), but the quality of ingredients is high, and the food is very fresh & flavorful.

We got the moros cakes to share, and they were delicious as well. It has a hipster vibe, and the food does not disappoint.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTyJEyeVHowfdHbohvKKpIDHiX1exebv4oIR8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1529347271796, 'text': 'Thank you, Vaughn!'}< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c411b7031fa9:0xb0e306ea8a24fed0</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Super cute with great vegan options! Most importantly, they open early which (as an early riser) I totally appreciate. Oh and I think the snickerdoodle pancake has drugs in it (jk, it’s just really delicious)!</review>

I STILL dream about their Mikey’s Chilaquiles. Sooooo good. 😋 Their house pancakes with oat corn and buckwheat paired with their maple butter explodes with taste in your mouth. I just ate their organic mushroom and asparagus frittata and it was incredible. Their vegan and gluten-free options are just as delicious, too. Their Prickly Pear Passion Chia Pudding is as scrumptious as it is refreshing. Needless to say, I will be ordering Kitchen Mouse even when I’m not on set.

The food is delicious and the place is adorable, it’s great for brunch. The only drawback is that it’s really popular so you may have to wait in line on the weekends, but the food is great I highly suggest eating here.< /review>

<Review>Good vegan and vegetarian breakfast options. Loved that you could sub out eggs for avocado or tofu scramble on most dishes. Yummy vegan treats, non-caffeinated hot beverages in addition to coffee, vegan cheese, the works! The “crab” benedict and the tofu scramble were amazing. My only complaint is that the serving sizes were quite small and it was pretty crowded. I’d avoid coming here during prime time because there was a long line.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The cute, retro kitschy decor is only the beginning at Kitchen Mouse. Catering to the vegan gluten-free crowd, the breakfast tacos can be made with either egg or tofu. I'm neither, so I chose the egg option and added the optional avocado. It was really good. Fresh corn tortillas filled with scrambled egg, lettuce and greens and drizzled with delicious creamy sauce.  I also opted for a strawberry corn muffin that was also delicious. My friend ordered the Sunshine Bowl which had seasonal fruit nestled on top of fresh homemade yogurt  and sprinkled with granola. Garnished with chia seeds and an edible flower, she said it was refreshing. She also had a gluten-free chocolate donut that she said was really good.  They offer bottomless coffee and free wifi as well. Definitely recommend Kitchen Mouse.</Review>

Kitchen mouse is perfect for those looking for a vegetable based meal. Eggs are optional for vegans that want to avoid them in some of the meals offered such as the chilaquiles dish. The quinoa I had was delicious and tasted like it had sesame oil. It looked like a light meal but I was honestly surprised to find myself asking for a to-go box. Definitely recommend.<//review>

Second time ordering from this place. Seems a little overpriced for the quality of the food, forgotten order on takeout purchase, and unusual and rude demeanor of staff at front register. Heard alot of great things about this place but it misses the mark for me.</Text>

Very good brunch spot, kinda wait a while, but with the food wait. Good vegan options, and their gluten free pancakes are by far the best gluten free pancakes I've tried, other ones taste plain AF.<//Review>

I love the atmosphere here. All vegetarian with vegan and gluten-free options. We tried the crab cakes, pancakes, and breakfast tacos. All of them were good. They also give you complimentary mini corn muffins - probably some of the best corn muffins I've had in LA. It's busy at brunch, but we were able to find a table without issue.</Review>

Deliciously surprising vegetarian food. Cute layout that connects to a cute store which I couldnt visit. Outside tables are pet friendly, outside only. Good menu, time sensitive, intriguing dishes. Went for lunch and had a warm chai tea and uncle Joe's breakfast sandwich. Tea was great, sandwich is a delicious mess, grab extra napkins, soo worth it. Breakfast tacos were also a hit. Relaxing and welcoming, almost comforting.  Best vegetarian spot in LA< /review>

I've been here only once but was very impressed. Will definitely return. It's a spacious cafe that also feels cozy. Cute interior decor and great service. Food's quality is high and price competitive for this area. Plenty of street parking and reasonable open lots. In a very happening part of HP. Safe and easy to locate.< /text>

I’ve been coming here for a few years now and I’m at the point where it feels like home. I love the staff and the cozy environment. Recently I’ve been so happy that I can get my morning coffee and breakfast at Kitchen Mouse and then pop over to TOPO for some ready-made lunches. While I love just about everything on the menu... my go-to is the Chilaquiles with a fried egg and a single snickerdoodle pancake (if I have a sweet tooth that day). I love this place so much, it’s extremely family friendly (they have an entire play-area so your kids can play while you enjoy your food).

So happy I live so close to such a special place.<//text>

<text>Okay, so this may not justify the four star rating.  I'm not vegan, so trying the vegan cheese sauce for the first time wasn't a good idea.  It might take some ti.e to acquire a taste for it.  I had the chilaquiles, which weren't too bad, but the cheese sauce didn't hit the spot.  If you're vegan this is a good place for you.  Let's talk about the coffee... great, but pricey.

Enjoy!</text>< resp>

My favorite part of the meal was the array sauces that you can try to go along with the arepa. They also had a nice selection of bottled beers for the limited menu. Service wise the food came out pretty quick.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Hmmmm.... three stars because customer service that's what got the 3. Without that it would be a 1. Ordered Postmates so maybe the pies were not warm enough. Not what I expected. Just kinda ok.< /Review>

HP is on its way to gentrification and Kitchen Mouse is part of this transformation.  Missing a couple of stars NOT because of the food.

Very long line, long wait, would have been nice to have been greeted and informed as it's not clear that you need to wait in line first to order before sitting down. You can't see the sign letting you know this because the sign is at the bottom of the counter and people are standing in front of it.  I thought people standing in line  were ordering to go.

After you order, it's all self service after that.  You need to get your own water, coffee, condiments.  They serve you your food and no one ever comes back to check on you.  Not sure that is the norm or if they're under staffed.

Very cute hipster space, but not a place for strollers.

Now that I know the rules of play, the food was good enough for me to go back and I'll give it another try.</Text>

Kitchen Mouse is always a great place to go to. It's usually pretty busy each time I go there, but I always find a place to sit. Parking can be so-so, but over all the food is great and I like that they have lots of healthy options for sure.<//Review>

<text>I love the ambience and vibe of the place.  It's very healthy and I found it to be a tad unsatisfying.  I ordered the chilaquiles and the sauce was really tasty but everything on the plate felt random.  I also had a side of snickerdoodle pancake and it was such a healthy pancake that it shouldn't be associated with snickerdoodle. They gave us a taste of a corn muffins with a spicy jam and the spicy jam amazing but the corn muffin was somewhat underwhelming.  I'd go back to have a coffee and an egg dish and enjoy the bustle.<//text>< date>

This place was great and just what our group was looking for. Super tasty breakfast stuff and good tacos too. Everything vegan except for eggs. I will definitely be coming back when I am around this area.  Very bright open space and good table layout. Easy enough parking on the side streets around it.< /text>

Excellent on my first visit here. Atmosphere was casual and light. The food was beyond flavorful. Colorful dishes, fantastic teas and drinks.  I am returning.
(only negative, is choice/ loudness of the music playing)
Don't forget to swing by the fabulous Mr Holmes Bakehouse, literally around the corner. Mouth watering desserts.<//Review>

<Name>Marissa Berrini<//Name><Date>1576978572154</Date><rating>5<//rating><Text>This is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. Located in Highland Park, it's the perfect breakfast place for vegans and vegetarians. Even my husband who isn't vegan enjoys this restaurant. There are plenty of delicious options but my favorites are chilaquiles and a side order of snickerdoodle pancakes. It's heaven on Earth! The snickerdoodle pancakes come with the most amazing coconut whipped butter I've ever had. In terms of drinks I really love their lattes with almond milk and iced tea. Sometimes they gift mini cornbread muffins during their brunch service. If you have kids there's a play area in the back to keep them entertained. If you like to eat solo there's a wrap-around bar perfect for dining alone and people watching. Last but not least be sure to get there early because on the weekends there is normally a line. It's also great cuz you can order at the counter and not have to deal with splitting any checks when going with groups. Don't forget to go to their gift shop next door which has the most amazing merchandise for gifts or treating yourself!< /Text>< Pics>

Fantastic vegetarian joint, adorably decorated and rampant with hipsters. Even as a non-vegetarian, I love the food here. The breakfast sandwich, the sunshine bowl, the pancakes, and the chilaquiles are all fantastic. It's great for breakfast/brunch/lunch and a good place to have a coffee chat or read a book. You want it to be less expensive for how small the portions are, but you spend the money anyway. The coffee is also good!<//text>

Took my parents here when they were visiting. My dad is not too fond of skipping meat. He enjoyed it none the less. As vegetarian, I love having good brunch options. Always packed for brunch. You order before you sit. So be ready to stand for a while. Serve yourself coffee while you wait for a table.<//text>

About as hipster as it gets. Organic foods that will delight. I recommend their tacos. They recently expanded their space so there's plenty of seating. Accessible from the gold line and located in one of the lively Highland Park corridors.<//Review>

Breakfast tacos and the vanilla latte are the only thing worth while here. Overpriced and unoriginal. Was nicer when it was smaller and less hipster.<//Text>

Searching for the perfect breakfast, this place is it!

Where else can you find tempeh on the menu, so many vegetarian and vegan food options, and the pancakes are not made with white flour.

Good job, kitchen mouse, leading the way to the future of food.

The food is not only good for you, but it’s good for the environment, and this small place we call earth.

No animals have to lose their life for you to eat here, and it turns out, eating like this lowers ones risk of heart disease and stroke.

Only improvement I can suggest? Please have more keto, low carb options.

But this is it. As more and more people realize the benefits of a plant based diet, whole wheat ingredients, vegetables, there will be more demand for such restaurants in the future!</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c411b7031fa9:0xb0e306ea8a24fed0</Gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1563811655390, 'text': 'Hi Arsen! Thank you for coming and for your incredible review!

<Text>Kitchen Mouse is an institution in our house. This is one of the best vegan restaurants that I've ever been to (maybe *the* best) and is local with a very relaxed atmosphere. They are busy for breakfast as they should be, but don't miss lunch. Everything is great and I would make my way here even if it were not down the street.< /Text></record>

<Review>They have now expanded and doubled in size!  Lots of tables now. Versus when they first opened.
Pancakes are awesome, and gluten free!  My buddy doesn't care whether or not something has gluten. And he said these were the tastiest pancakes he's had in a long time.

Girlfriend had the breakfast sandwich. She didn't like it.... She loved it!  I had a bite of it. I could see why.

Service is great and very friendly!

Love the gomasio rice cakes (with over easy eggs and side of avocado). The combination of flavors is diverse and pointed across duration of meal.

The ambience is great: lots of hip looking people and young families, one table almost always has a baby, friendly staff, high vaulted ceiling and Mediterranean colors, with large windows and lots of natural lighting.<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Really a terrific place for breakfast.

The snickerdoodle pancake was yummy and not too sweet — I’d ask for a second dollop of butter. Ideally for me there would be some other flavors and textures on the plate but I enjoyed sharing these.

The chilaquiles with a side of tofu scramble were terrific. Lots of different flavors and textures on this plate.

It’s helpful that the coffee is self-serve but I wished they offered oat milk, as they do for the espresso drinks.

So cute that they have a play area for little ones in the back.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1503526384199, 'text': 'Thanks, Jason!'}</Resp></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I love getting the day old bakery goodie bags in the morning!  It's a dream of a place to eat for no gluten or dairy.  Coffee lovers that must have regular cow's mucus, they offer that too.  Glory Bowl, morros cakes and the crunchy rice kale salad (but only when the rice is crunchy do I like it) are my favorites!  Any baked good will sure to delight!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>This gem of a restaurant serves health vegetarian options, the food is fabulously delicious, fresh and favorable. My favorite dish is the "Chilequiles" served with a homemade Chile sauce (very mild) avocado, black beans and a delicious cabbage salad. Trimmings include two sauces (wish I had the recipes) lime and crunchy pepitas. Bring an appetite, it's a large portion! You can order a side of eggs if you want.
Bring plenty of change, parking is metered. While you're there, Mr. Holmes Bakery is just around the corner, they serve the very best pastries. I would buy them before your breakfast/lunch at the Kitchen Mouse, once they run out, that's it until the next day.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1518724886255, 'text': 'Thank you, Juana!'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c411b7031fa9:0xb0e306ea8a24fed0< /Gmap_id></record>

Great place for brunch, casual and serve tasty food. Its not a completely vegan place since they serve egg and milk. But most their brunch items are tasty. I would recommend the avocado tlt ( tempeh bacon, avocado, salad on millet toast) and huevos ranchero. They both tasted great. Also you won't feel bloated or food coma after leaving this place.</Text>

This place is expensive. The seating area is really nice. The portions are ok. I tried the chilaquiles and the cinnamon coconut pancakes. Those were a healthy version of Mexican chilaquiles and were not bad but I definitely wouldn't get it again. The pancakes I would they were really good.</Review>

Bougie.  Small portions. Overpriced.  It’s the squirl of highland park, aka a place for trust funders to meet up and wear their normcore clothes and totally suck.  Highland park is being ruined at a thousand miles an hour and this place is quintessential.< /Review>

< Review>
I'm a big fan of this place. Most of their food is vegan, and all vegetarian. That doesn't mean it is the most healthy though, so look out if you care about that. I have tried most things on their menu and can say with confidence that while it may not be great for your body to eat here everyday, your soul will thank you. I particularly like their baked goods, their breakfast tacos, their avocado TLT, and the buffalo bowl.</Review>

<Review>The egg sandwich with a lemon oil was a totally new and delicious experience for me.</Review></record>
</dataset><record>
<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Excellent vegetarian and vegan cuisine with a hometown country kitchen hippie vibe. I'm by no means a vegetarian, but this is a great place to stop for lunch or breakfast, especially with my friends who have more selective diets. Kitchen Mouse does have eggs for those of us who aren't vegetarian and the Stumptown drip coffee is self-serve and pretty darn good, or espresso and coldbrew if that's your jam.

They've got rice and veggie bowls, tacos, and standard breakfast fare like eggs, toast, and pancakes, or varieties of salads if you're looking for lunch fare.  I most recently had the weekend special, the jackfruit crab benedict. It's different, much lighter than a normal benedict, I don't think it had any bread, just eggs, seasoned jackfruit, and hollandaise on a bed of citrusy arugula. It was delicious, but could have used a bit more seasoning and I wish it came with toast as it wasn't terribly filling.

The line get pretty long on the weekends and seating can be hard to find, best to get here early if you want to beat the brunch rush. You order at the counter, paper menus can be found near the register. They'll give you a number to place on your table.<//text>< Resp>

During the week I'm usually torn between the Huevos Rancheros or the Morning Glory Bowl or the Tacos, both kinds....

I haven't had anything bad there. My kid loves the hot chocolate too with the coconut whip on top!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Straight up amazing food! This spot is vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free/ celiac friendly. The veggie tacos are sooo delicious (The mushroom and tempeh tacos on the dinner menu are amazing!) and the veggie breakfast choices are perfect (be sure to get a side of tempeh bacon and/ or veggie sausage). Can't recommend it enough!< /review>

ALWAYS NOISY.  Have had a hilarious time or two trying to order at the order-counter-register; wait-person and I could not hear each other over the bad music. You have to ratchet down expectations and assume loud group conversations, crying kids, random high pitched electronic messaging to the kitchen, trying to be drowned out with the bland music. I know, I know, I'm not in a library setting, I realize. (Though, they do have a fair collection of diverse cookbooks for your reading pleasure.) During a recent (usually) short wait for food, I downloaded a Decibel measuring smartphone app.  Just as I thought, 65 to 80 db, which the app says ranges /compares normal conversation at 3 feet to vacuum cleaner and alarm clocks (next level is power mower.) Evidence enough that this not just a figment of my imagination or misanthropic view. (Although....)
I usually order the GLK breakfast, or Avocado TLT or the whachacallit open-faced sandwich with sauerkraut on top. The rest makes me squeamish.
The vegan faux-Mexican dish my lunch-date ordered was a failure, obviously needing some visual help. It looked particularly disgusting. Doesn't culinary training encompass serving the food in an appearance that is appetizing and tasty?  Frequently notice the over use of salt here, especially in salads, even when requested not to add it. You'd think a health-concern such as this would be intuitive.  Hipsters sometimes are not so hip, I guess.< /review>

Why has Kitchen Mouse not addresses the “whites only” that was written on the entrance of the establishment. This saddens me and leads me to never want to come back.< /Text>

It's some vegetarian business. I'm a little resistant to vegan foods trying to be things they aren't, so I stick to things that are really vegetarian by nature, and I'm not disappointed.</Review>

A place that serves healthy and delicious food, the kind of thing you can easily find in LA, but each brings its own approach, making each place unique. And the Kitchen Mouse is no exception.

The food served is organic, vegan, gluten-free and even so it is not tasty. You can order whatever you want it will be tasty, well seasoned and even generous, justifying the price a little above average.

Um lugar que serve comida saudável e deliciosa, o tipo de coisa que até que se encontra facilmente em LA, mas cada um traz a sua abordagem, tornando cada lugar único. E o Kitchen Mouse não é exceção.

A comida servida é orgânica, vegana, gluten-free e nem por isso ela não é saborosa. Pode pedir o que quiser que vai ser gostoso, bem temperado e com uma porção até que generosa, justificando o preço um pouco acima da média.<//text>< pictures>
