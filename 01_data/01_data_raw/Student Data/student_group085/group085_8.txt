<Text>It was our first time there and I will never go back. The service was horrible, the Banda favors people. One of the banda singers wasn't friendly and would ignore our song requests. Culichitown is better than this place.  The Banda at Culichitown treats everyone the same. Don't waste your time at 701 Restaurant and Bar.</Text>< Pics>

This restaurant is one of my favorites
Food is Authentic, especially the Beans
Steaks drinks everything.  However the
Waitress are very rude stone face or poker face.  But i still love the food.
I there 3 times a week I plan to speak

First time visiting this restaurant but I have to give it 2 stars because Service here is very unprofessional we ask the server nicely if we can please have a heater he said no they were all  occupied. 25min later he comes back to take our order for our drinks & it took another 15-20min for us to get them we then a had to flag another server so we can order our food because the first one never came back our food took like 35min my wife did like the drinks & food but very disappointed on the way that we were treated.<//Text>

The Agua Chile is very good but everything else is just OK. Their prices are incredibly high. I ordered a trio fajita plate. The chicken was dry; carne Asada was leathery; and, the shrimp was way over cooked. They have a delicious green salsa but refuse to give you more than a few tablespoons at a time. I had to keep flagging down the waitress to refill my water and provide three more tablespoons of that green salsa. Customer service is poor, and let’s not forget about all the flies!!!! First and last time here!</text>

<Text>I went to this restaurant yesterday , and is a very nice place , the food is good the waiter Armando was very kind and gave us a good friendly service. Overall the place is good and I would recommend it . If you live in Montebello and haven’t gone to the 701 restaurant you should give a try.< /Text>< pictures>

California roll was cream cheese and a shrimp inside white rice served with marinara and chipotle sauce, seating was in a parking lot, servers did not respond to being hailed, food was bland, music was too loud, many flies present during meal< /text>

< Review>
I come here for a quick pizza fix and when I’m on a budget. The new $6 pizza is extra cheesy and tastes better than the regular $5 one. This place is convenient because they let you order online, and you can pick up your order quickly. This is good if you need to order a lot of boxes. The staff is good and are quick to take your order. Sometimes if they run out of pizza then you have to wait for a few minutes. The pizza is always hot and the cheese is melted. This pizza is good to eat at the moment, but it doesn’t taste good when reheated. Overall, this is a good place to come get quick pizza for a good price.<//Review>

$8.73
Average Little Caesars hourly pay ranges from approximately $8.73 per hour for Supervisor to $12.73 per hour for Junior Managing Director.

Little Caesars pays $8.73 an hour. Last time I visit little ceasers I seen about 4 employees working inside the restaurant.

Let's do the math. $8.73 x 8 hours = $69.84 Little Caesars pays their employees a day.

I'm estimating little ceasers sells approximately 10 pizzas in one hour. $7 a pizza.

$7 x 10 in hour = $70

Little Caesars makes $70 in one hour of sells. They are open 8 hours a day.

$70 x 8 = $560

Little ceasers makes approximately $560 in 8 hours a day. And pays their employees $69.84 a day.

Little Ceasers makes $560 in 8 hours and pays their employees - $279.36 out of the $560 a day they make in sells.

$560 - $279.36 = $280.64

Little Ceasers makes $280.64 a day approximately in profits. Whit pay employees.

In one week little ceasers makes $1,403.02

In one month little ceasers makes
$5,612.80 of profits.

$67,353.60  a year of profits. Little ceasers been in business for about 5 years now approximately:  $336,738.00 in five years little ceasers makes profits selling pizzas at $7.

There's a reason why they still in business.< /text>

Good service clean fast and they got a new thing that looks like an Amazon pick up locker but for pizza I definitely want to try it 🐱
edit: I tried the locker thing its so cool and easy you order online and they notify you when its ready to pick up you go and punch in the code to the locker and grab the pizza and go so fun! Plus one of the cashiers there is super sweet! /.\<//Text>

< Review>
First of all I placed an order over the phone to ensure that my order was ready by the time I got to this location. By the time I get there I approach the young lady and I request my order. She notifies me that no one placed and order and begins to tell me that I called the wrong location. I know for a fact that I placed the right call to the right place. So I have to place a whole new order the lady now tells me that I have to wait 10 minutes for my pizza. I witnessed every other patron receive their food instantly the same patrons that she made the same advisements to. I waited almost 25 minutes for my order to come out only to have it be wrong. At this point my level of frustration was very high and I requested a refund.</Review>

Even when I call ahead to make a order and I arrive 10 mins later they still make me wait another 10-12 mins each and everytime and I’ve been there a lot so the fact that not once have they ever given me my pizza on time is amazing ...  if there was another pizza place closer I would go but unfortunately no matter what time I order or what day even if I walk in and order a simple cheese pizza I wait 18-22 mins</Review>

I placed a phone order and went in 15 min later my order was not ready and waited another 25 minutes got my order and it was not what I paid for.. The boss was worse than the other's that work there. I shouldn't have went back but on another occasion it was the same thing a long wait and when I finally got my order it was not what I ordered and they given my order away and had to wait double the time . It's not worth it. Yes it's close and convenient but I'm going the extra mile to avoid the confusion. It's really annoying they don't know what there doing< /review>

<review>Friday night and they have only 1 cashier. Stood in line literally 30 mins! Now I see why! The cashier has no clue how to find the orders! I watched her open every oven door and look at every box for every single Customer then walk around the kitchen looking for orders!  After looking for my order and not finding it she said it was still not ready. I had called it in 35 mins B4 and was told it'd take 15-20 mins so I found it hard to believe. I asked for the manager. 5 mins later an employee in the back says "that one came out already!" (My order was unique so he remembered it.) Sure enough the manager opened an oven and there it was. No one has put anything else in so I am certain it was there and she missed it. Guessing the 7-10 customers waiting outside also we're waiting pointlessly....... This employee seriously needs to be trained. Shame on management for not providing proper training and putting her solo on the registers on a Friday night! Train her and fix the way you organize the pizzas waiting to be picked up.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The salesman Joseph (with Allied) was awesome, the price I was quoted was what I paid. And they offered the lowest price easily. About$1000 lower than any of the other companies I called. The movers came and were very professional, and brought our stuff within 2 days. It was super fast, and everything came safe. My only complaint was the move coordinator Irma (Beverly Hills Transfer and Storage). I called to ask her a question to verify specifics about the move and she verbally bit my head off and acted like I was trying to take advantage of the company. Luckily I talked to Joseph and was able to get my question answered. However I almost cancelled with this company because of Irma. I would suggest Allied/BHT&S put her through some customer service training because she needs it.< /text>

<Review>This was the best move start to finish I have ever experienced. Even price was less than expected. Professional, courteous, and personable.
Allied all the way.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I cannot warn people strongly enough to avoid using Beverly Hills Transfer & Storage. Their staff are liars and mislead purposefully to simply get the business. Extremely disappointed and they refuse to discuss our grievances. Furthermore they threatened to keep our belongings once on the truck without full payment , but the payment demanded far exceeded what they committed to</text>< Pics>

First it was he had am issue with the trailer prior to picking up our stuff, then it was an issue with the truck itself after pickup and then he claimed an elevator at another customer's delivery location was broken and he had to wait for the elevator to be repaired before he could deliver there and head our way to deliver to us. Then it was delivery schedule changes along the way. After finally showing up a week late our stuff was damaged. To top it off they damaged the exterior of our home in the process of moving stuff inside. I wasn't there during the delivery, but my girlfriend was and brought up being late to which the driver told her well you aren't getting any money becuase the lateness was the result of a mechanical issue with the truck. When she asked what about the elevator for which he decided to wait for and delay our delivery for 3 more days he said well I can give you $50 now. When she said I would feel more comfortable filing a claim he got upset and told her off. Then when she asked what about the damage to the house he said those stones around the entry way weren't affixed properly and it wasn't his fault they knock them lose and they fell off. The driver had the nerve to call me and claim my girlfriend was just being a woman about it all and being too emotional. He said he need to talk to me as a man about because as a man I would understand. He was a total chauvinist and a liar. Other than the sales guy who porivded us the quote everyone else in the process was terrible. I would never use Allied Van Lines (Beverly Hills Moving & Storage).</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Stay clear of this company by all means. They were Allied Moving. This was the biggest bait and switch ever pulled. The original moving consultant was wonderful, great customer service, very thorough, and a pleasure to work with. Once the paper is signed and it gets handed over to the moving coordinator everything was downhill. However the movers that packed up my place were great and very thoughtful, wrapped everything and were efficient.

The office and coordinator for the move has been another story. I was guaranteed up to 14 days for delivery time it’s now been over 20 days and nothing. The communication and updates leave a ton to be desired I was promised a daily update however 3 days later and still no update despite the fact I was emailing asking for an update everyday. I was given a 800 number to a claims department, they were supposed to send an email to fill a form out to be compensated for every day the truck is late. No email. The truck was supposed to arrive for the second time and I was guaranteed it would yet I never heard a confirmation. The coordinator Charles gave me the number of the driver “in case he wanted to reach out” I finally reached out to the driver since I hadn’t heard about the delivery window, he said I wasn’t scheduled for another 4-5 days. It’s definitely not the drivers fault it’s 100% management. They had over 30 days to schedule this delivery but the day before the first arrival was set they still hadn’t coordinated a driver.< /Text>

Update: We paid a fake charge as they held our stuff ransom. Now they refuse to deliver and are ignoring all emails and calls.

Be warned about the practices used. They offer a price beat guarantee for other companies. This dishonest practice got me unfortunately. I had a fixed price from a company and the staff member came out and checked everything on it. He then waited until I was closer to my deadline and I got a price higher than the other quote. By then it was too late to go with the other company. I then reluctantly agreed to pay more.
Next they came and made me sign a long form accepting terms and conditions. They packed up everything and took it away.
I was using less than half of a container but paid for the full one. They then charge me an additional $800 as it weighed more than estimated and I either accept it or pay more to get it back.
They say it wasn't a fixed price and even though the guy said it was, the small prints says they can charge you extra.
So watch out and avoid. Nothing is fixed and as soon as you accept they can charge you whatever they want and you are held to ransom.</text>

<text>Damaged multiple items, grown men raced down the halls of the storage facility on my antique tricycles, I received 2 boxes belonging to another customer and am still missing some of my items! Worst moving experience ever.
Also, after breaking an expensive cabinet, when I asked about making an insurance claim, The gal who spoke English just fine suddenly had difficulty communicating and could only point and insist on a signature to complete the paperwork so they could leave. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY and avoid Allied’s inflated prices!<//text>< rating>

I had been using this company for over 12 years for storage. They changed warehouse locations multiple times on where the storage was located which was fine. But when I had fallen behind on my payments and want to come to check on my storage items and pay my balance in person I was informed they had already “auctioned” my items off. Since it’s dry storage, I have no idea how long I had been paying for the storage and the items had been “auctioned” including family photos and other items that are only valuable to me. Anytime I would call there was never a friendly person on the other end. I would never recommend this business.<//review>

The communication from my coordinators Tonya and Aaron was way beyond expectations! They made this stressful move as easy as possible.

EDIT: After arriving at my destination, I saw that some items were missing that were not even logged by the pick up employees. Because there isn't record of them, Allied will not take responsibility for them and won't reimburse me for the missing items. I'm very uncomfortable with BHTS now because who knows if their guys can just take what they want, not log it on the paperwork, and have no repercussions? The company will do nothing about this and I can no longer recommend them to people I know.

EDIT 2: After complaining I received a replaced item in the mail. I appreciate the effort to make up for their errors.<//text>

Overall I had a great experience with Beverly Hills Transfer & Storage. They were quick to come out to give me an estimate and were able to pick up my move within a week of requesting the quote! Gilbert & his team were fantastic- efficient, friendly, and took good care of my stuff. They delivered SO fast too- picked up Thursday AM in Los Angeles and delivered Saturday AM in San Francisco. Throughout the process we had one issue but Chris was quick to fix it & make everything right. Definitely recommend!<//Review>

If you enjoy hit&runs, lost paperwork, getting stabbed by chefs knives scattered throughout your moving boxes, sexual harassment, and the destruction of everything you own... This is the company for you!!!

-Experience the the thrill of the of watching a 18 wheel truck crash into your neighbor's pickup only to have Beverly Hills Transfer & Storage deny it happened!
-Ladies!  Do you enjoy men you don't know asking probing/disturbing/debasing questions about your marriage? Or do you favor unsolicited opinions on your reproductive choices? With this company you can have BOTH!!!!
-Encounter individuals who will ignore even the simplest of requests and sometimes do the exact opposite at the risk of your personal safety!
-Breathtaking Incompetence!  Stunning lack of ethics!  Plus, once they leave you get to move the furniture that "didn't fit in the elevator" into your new home alone!  And remember, every unlabeled and mislabeled box you open could contain a free open wound!
*Special Bonus Feature (There is a distinct chance that you will meet GODOT if you hire this company)

Fun for the whole family and a class action lawsuit waiting to happen!<//Review>

I had absolutely no issues with how they did their business at all. The lots are cramped for a full sized vehicle, so you may have to really work it to get turned around in the lot...but the order in which they did things is a definite A Plus. They treated me with respect. And they were efficient.</Review>

UNPROFESSIONAL!  They damaged 2 expensive items and they will not take responsibility for it.  Furthermore, they are very condescending people to deal with.  On a personal level and on a professional level, I cannot recommend that anyone deals with them.  The one positive note was the promptness and courtesy of the salesman who gave us the estimate.< /review>

<Text>The person who did our free estimate was pleasant and thorough. We ran into some communication problems after we decided to go with Allied over two other moving companies. Beverly Hills Storage wanted to charge us $1,000 more because the move was not booked with Allied after we signed the contract. To their credit, the issue was quickly resolved after a phone call to the owner. The driver was very professional. Overall, we felt they gave us a fair price for our cross-country move and it was a much better experience than a previous cross-country move six years ago. Just be sure to follow up frequently to make sure your move is registered with Allied and you get the price that was quoted locked in.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Horrible. Unprofessional. Uncaring. Uncommunicative. Ineffective. “Moving coordinator “ Arianne Cotton an unprofessionally sarcastic and useless of no help. No one, after more than a week of calls and emails, has helped or answered as to where our missing goods are. No one. A transcontinental move that is an ongoing nightmare of epic proportions.
Allied should be ashamed.</Review>

<text>They are terrible.
12 hours to pack a less than 600 Sq ft one bedroom one bathroom apartment. They Packers left their food trash and after specifically asking the guy who did the estimate if I would need to empty my dresser drawers.  I was assured that there was absolutely no need to remove the conents. I gave the driver's my cell phone number and told them to call me if they had questions.
I came back at the end of the 12 hours to sign paperwork. The drawers were empty. Dirty, sweaty, nasty bad mannered male strangers - Packers who constantly complained about what they deemed to be "too much stuff" had removed all the contents of the dresser and packed them. Sorry but I was so grossed out by them touching my personal undergarments  I threw out about $1500 worth of undergarments and lingerie.  It was disgusting.  I called and informed them. It seemingly put even them off and I did manage to get  $1000 off the overpriced total for the move.  I  still took a  financial hit. If you have female loved ones and care about them and their possessions   don't risk using  this revolting company.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2caf35e1a3815:0x68d2673c5a21cc60<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They are terrible. I have done quite a few cross country moves, and this company was by far the worst experience I have ever had. They banged up all of my stuff and roughed up antiques. Lied about boxes that were missing. Refused to respond to communications about problems with the move. Refused to acknowledge a request for a refund for the cost of packaging up a framed object that they did not pack and which subsequently broke. Irresponsible, incompetent, and completely uncaring about their customers and their possessions. Stay away at all costs</Review>< Name>

<review>Do NOT use this company!! We moved from LA to the Midwest this summer and thought that we would get what we paid for. Their prices are double of most companies, however we felt that they were trustworthy and we proceeded to sign a contract with them. They showed up a day early to move us, displacing our entire family for 2 days, however we had no choice if we wanted to make our flight a few days later. They took $200 off the bill (which is almost insulting) and the only person that apologized or even seemed to care was Arianne. Unfortunately, she has no control over the matter.  It is now several weeks later and we do not have any of our belongings - because they DONT HAVE A DRIVER!!!  How do you run a moving business and not have drivers???? We were told to go ahead and start replacing our things because they don’t forsee our things being delivered anytime soon. So please, don’t use this company. Don’t fall for their sleazy sales pitch of “your things will never sit in a storage, we will deliver them directly to you”. Or, my personal favorite “we don’t want your stuff, we will get it to you!”
Save money and go with anyone but Beverly Hills Transfer and Storage.</review><rate>1<//rate><time>1535405813507</time>< user_id>

<Text>the price was right and the service was what I expected.  We had a small move from pasadena to slc with a 1 bedroom apartment worth of furniture.  We packed everything ourselves and labels everything including numbering the boxes so we wouldn't lose anything.  We marked everything that had glass in it as FRAGILE.  Everything was delivered intact and quickly.

We did have a slight miscue setting up the move with an email getting overlooked on their side, but they made up for it by going the extra mile and getting us there at the original quote.

No overages, everything got there in one piece and in good shape.  All told this was a solid move.  We would use these guys in the future if we needed to move again.< /Text><userid>114161255121893933673</userid>< date>

Beverly Hills Transfer and Storage- wow they are great. They moved me from Los Angeles to Palm Desert and to Cooperstown New York.
Then they moved me from Palm Desert to Texas and again to New York. They are the most professional group of men and women that I have ever experienced, and recommend them highly.< /Review>

I used BHTS services to move from LA, California to Cleveland, Ohio.
I sent them a request over their website, next day they called me and arranged an appointment. 2 employee came morning (Arianne and Mike), on time as scheduled, they called 30 minutes prior to coming. They evaluated my stuff, they were very professional and friendly. I felt comfortable to deal and communicate with them.
They explained their system, how many days it gonna take, the assembling, unloading, brief history about the company and little statistics.
At night I received an email from them with the estimate price, weight and all the details.
I did 90% of packing by myself. they did the refrigerator, beds, mattresses, Guitar and they did extra warping to my "warped" tables.
They got a parking permit, 5 days prior to the move there was signs on the street side. the guy who came to do the evaluation kept communicating with me via e-mail and he answered all my question fast! as soon as he got it! days, night even weekends. Which was super great!!

On the moving day May 10th, the driver called me 30 minutes prior to the appointment, he came on time with his helpers, they put a "Red Carpet" which was cool (Hollywood style ;) ). the driver was friendly and immediately started to put stickers on all the boxes with a serial number, one by one. He was professional with what he was doing. then they started to take the boxes to the truck.
within 5 hours they were done. the helpers were very friendly and cooperative. they handled my stuff with care.
He gave me my copies of the inventory and he gave me his phone number to truck him. he told me when to expect my stuff to arrive in Ohio!
I had some worries as I saw some boxes I marked as "Fragile" on the base line in the truck! I communicated the BHTS guys on spot, and they replied on spot as well! they checked with the driver and assured me and explained to me their packing and loading technique.

On May 22nd I received a phone call from the driver telling me that he is coming next day morning. May 23rd the same driver called me that he arrived, he examined the alley, however, it was narrow for the truck, so he explained that he will need an hour to rent  a smaller truck. after an hour, a smaller truck brought my stuff with the driver and 2 helpers. within 3 hours all my stuff were in my new apartment. The helpers tried to put each box in the correct room but they didn't do great with that! one of the helper was friendly, yet the other wasn't at all!!.
They assembled the refrigerator for me, as they had to take the doors off in California (it was huge compering to the apartments door).

Nothing was broken, nothing was scratched, nothing was missing.
Well, I found 1 tiny dish broken!! but it was 7700 Ib shipment and all was in the same condition as I gave, except that tiny dish, so it is FINE.

Over all the experience was great, If I moved again, I'm gonna use their services too and for sure I recommend it for you. :)

Professional, Friendly, Punctual and they answer any question, as soon as possible :)
I'm satisfied.
BHTS God Bless you, I give you 5 star ^_^</Review>

They moved my household across country and I was so elated when everything arrived in great condition and they didn't try to up charge me. They were between $1000 - $2000 cheaper than 5 other companies I received quotes from and I'm so glad I chose them!<//Review>

Popular sandwich shop that I'm not sure if it lives up to the hype. The wait was about 10 minute around noon and I had a Smoking Joe sandwich which was wrapped nice and warm. The portion is definitely decent, especially when you feel it in your hand.

I was really impressed by the sourdough bread, it smells great and has an airy, freshly baked texture. Meats are Boar’s Head deli so supposedly good. However, the overall flavor is less than exciting and overpowered by the "everything" sides including onions, pickles, and two kinds of peppers which seems too much (sour and spicy) for me.< /Text>

<Review>One of the best places to get a sandwich in San Francisco. All the bread is soft and has that fresh baked taste. Meat and veggies are in perfect balance with each other. Lots of options for every appetite, which can seem overwhelming but ask the the very friendly and helpful staff and they will help you out. Not to mention all the drinks and chips, every option you could need. All in all this is what a neighborhood deli should be.< /Review>< Pics>

I ordered via doordash, so I spent 20 dollars on this sandwich mind you. My biggest disappointment is it was not at all how I ordered it. I chose pepper turkey and dry salami, which they just gave me regular turkey. The sandwich was pretty good, but just disappointing I couldn't get what I ordered<//Review>

We got the loaded fries as well as the normal sandwich. Now, the sandwich is pretty light but the loaded fries are not. They have all the crunch of normal fries, but the extra flavor of cheese, bacon bits, etc. It's definitely delicious and worth getting, but the warning is that it can be heavy! (good thing the sandwich is on the light side).<//Text>

Many, many creative sandwiches with Boar's Head meats, fresh produce and amazing breads. The sour roll is that hard-to-find perfect bake with crunchy bubbles in the crust and soft inside. They also have a brisket cut of pastrami from Boar's Head, which is rare. Most places only have the top round. Will definitely be back!

This is the kind of deli I'll go out of my way to visit whenever I'm in S.F.<//review>

Large menu on the wall behind the counter features build your own sandwiches, toasted sandwiches, cold sandwiches, paninis, and breakfast sandwiches. In the morning you can also get bagels and coffee. They have a wall of chips and a cooler of bottled drinks. The service was outstanding and food came out quick. This no frills sandwich shop is the place to go. Parking is free on the street and plentiful.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8xh3RxtaHr5yNxkaSDLwX8uXsNYwtIn7S3g06=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_shy7elsceGfq9S7dqHiIvooe3USAaYqc5k4P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMN8ArZOPktMsz0h5nqraBfnAny9ZbcqAvIbnN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOscOAewflptxqIwVLTU1vcsfYE-P2JXSGgTC15=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5GLi0fgMY1Fsdu16ME_7wp7pw6VN60FA15wG_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808f7e323219eba3:0x5021efc203f40713<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>I don’t know how to describe what I just ate. It is named a Greek of the week, and I think they call that a sandwich, but honestly it wasn’t.
Eggplant under cooked, tasteless vegetables. I think they managed to mask the absence of taste by adding tons of jalapeño. It is simply not good.
Let’s talk about the price now. $8.99 for a tiny average sandwich. Go 3 blocks east, to Whole Foods and you’ll get the best sandwich for $8, 50% bigger, tasty ingredients and a broader choice.
It hurts to promote an Amazon company, but at least they feed you right.< /Text><rating>2< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We went here today and had the "Watchu Talkin’ Bout Wilbur" sandwich today with a bag of jalapeno heat kettle chips. It was the absolute best! I really really loved it, wouldn't change a thing about it :)< /Review>< Pics>

Tried the California sandwich in ciabatta. Was delicious. Can't wait to come back again to try more of their sandwiches.<//Review>

<Review>They need to take the "2 year old photo" quote unquote off there advertisement. It is false advertisement that they sell Panini's. It made me drive from San Carlos to San Francisco for them to tell me oh I'm sorry that a 2 year old picture, but if you want there is a whole foods down the street you could buy one .... Like I really want to go and drive several miles away from San Carlos when there are whole foods near San Carlos<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Best sandwich shop in the area hands down. Personal favorite: King George on sliced sourdough with pepper jack and extra jalapeno 😍🤩😍

Line can be a little long at lunch time but it moves fast and there's a good amount of seating while you wait.< /review>

<Text>Perfect place for a late night snack after a concert at theSan Francisco. Te employees are super cool and the food is excellent. If I had any advice is for Fat Sals to post a sign asking people kindly to smoke their weed further away from the entrance. I came for a meal not to get high.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808f7e323219eba3:0x5021efc203f40713< /gmap_id></record>

Cool sandwiches. It's a great alternative instead of Whole Foods deli. The selection is super huge and makes it hard to pick something, big sandwiches and you won't be disappointed. Also the crew is super friendly and ready to give some guidance on how to build your own. Perfect spot for those of us working in the Potrero area.< /review>

<Text>Two Sons' is a clean, friendly spot with a wide selection of great sandwiches.  The portions are generous and the bread is consistently fresh--make sure to check out the dutch crunch, a bay area classic.

You get a diverse crowd in here ranging from construction workers to soccer moms.  Regardless of where they're coming from, everyone's here for the same reason--the best sandwich selection this side of town.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Favorite sandwich place.  I go here once a week.  I get the dirty bird with chicken salad, no pickles, with cucumbers.  Finally toasted as well.  It's really good and filling!😁😀< /text>< response>

<Text>Phenomenal weekday lunch spot, run by the absolute nicest staff and owners. Sandwiches are high quality and very large, they don't skimp on any ingredients. Try the Cowboy Way!</Text>< Pictures>

Sandwiches are good and fresh. The only thing is that they don't have many vegetarian options. You can make your own but that's just it.</Review>

< Review>
I was underwhelmed by the sandwiches there. From a place which business is to sell sandwiches, it could be better. They don't score higher than a Safeway deli sandwich for me. To start, the rolls are disappointing. And while there is quite an extensive list of pre-set sandwiches, they are not so well thought. It still just feels like a bunch of topics thrown together, you are probably better off with a make-your-own, picking your favorite items.</Review>

The only thing better than how they make their sandwiches is how quickly they make them. If you need to pick up a quick work lunch, this is the spot.<//Text>

Excellent range of delicious sandwiches with a daily rotating special.  Tuesday is meatball sub day and not to be missed.  The "Offer you can't refuse" and "May the Pesto Man Win" are both great choices.<//review>

My wife and just flew in to SF, were wandering around the area and stumbled onto this place. We're both very happy with our Cowboy Way and Salsalito sandwiches on the dutch crunch bread. A little wait but worth it.</text>

<rating>3<//rating><review>Huge array of crystals—wands, towers, tumbled, rough—they pretty much had it all. They have gemstones starting at 50 cents—rare. It was nice to see tiny agate geodes for $5 and 3g’s of azurite for $10. They have a large selection of tumbled gemstones for under $10 which is the main appeal about this place for me. The have a large selection of gemstone jewelry, however things felt a bit too pricey for me—$40 and up. I did however enjoy that they sold pendents and chains—huge variety. The bigger crystals were pricey but they did carry a lot of crystals and of varying sizes. They also sold sage, books, tarot and oracle cards. Overall the experience was nice and I really enjoyed the background soothing guided meditation soundtrack.

Recommend if you’re a beginner or need a lot of smaller crystals for crystal grids.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b37d09acb333:0xf34627e67cb43004< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I visited Soothe your Soul for the first time in search for incense. I really like the quality and variety of incense available. I purchased Fred Soll's incense. The scent is Moonlight Jasmine and it smells AMAZING. It burned slow and the scent went throughout my home. Soothe your Soul has so much to offer from essential oils, crystals, books and so much more. The woman working in the store was so knowledgeable and made great recommendations.</review>

<Review>I love this place so much!! Service is wonderful, and the prices are shockingly good. So many companies charge exorbitant prices for stones like ametrine and selenite, but I found small pieces of both for a dollar or less each which made me so happy. 11/10 strongly recommend checking this place out, it's so wonderful!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Good staff. Some could know a bit more about their products. Or maybe specialize in a section? Was not given the new customer 10℅ discount but offered a postcard for 20℅ off the next visit. The free stone of the day - it would b nice if they would allow a person to choose the one they want instead of having one picked out and given to them, but. It's free so I hope the person that picked the one out had a good sense to pick out a good one for me...  And it would have been nice if ANY of the three people had any idea of what the metaphysical properties or old wives tale of the stone might have been. I had to search myself. I mean. Even just one item of info. Such as does it promote confidence or connect to a character.... Anything?  I still would go back but I'd bring my book on that information with me and make sure they know it's my personal book!  Still nice staff though. And I like that they had a book offered by a local writer who had signed the books.  Some people know more than others. And Bach Flower essence is there too!< /Review></record>

< Review>
Took a group of people  to this place and some forgot their discount card which was given when I made previous purchase for 50 VOLUNTEERS!.   Instead of them giving the 10% discount that they offer to all new customers - in lieu if the 25% off 1 item' they said card would have to be mailed in.  The store actually CALLED my guests requesting them to mail the card in.  We passed at leat 25 stores like this to drive from Pasadena.  I tried to support Rena, but she is petty and completely lacks the consciousness typical of metaphysical shop keepers.  Done with her.  We are 2 mins from Alexandra II in Pasadena.   No need to drive an hour to be treated that way.< /Review>

Great atmosphere, staff, and decent coffee house food. Parking is usually available as well, though some of the spots say 20 minutes only. Mostly tables for 2 people.

Loft (open 9-6) has a large table, and a toy area for kids.

Hard to see from the street.<//review>

This coffee shop is worth visiting because of its amazing taste of coffee and impressive services. The staffs are also amazing because they managed to handle my request easily and even made me feel so comfortable. It was really the nicest place that I've been to, and I'm sure that I will be considering this coffee shop to be my number one option from now on. Thanks a lot!</text>

- Durian waffle - It was OK. It didn't have a lot of flavor. I could hardly taste the durian. The waffle part just tasted like an ordinary waffle.< /review>

I ordered a matcha chai with soy milk because I’m lactose intolerant. The cup was even labeled soy It was the only thing I had consumed that morning so I know for sure it was dairy. Don’t go if you have allergies I guess. Also it was super watery.<//text>

This place is kind of tough to find, but it really gives meaning to the phrase "hidden gem"!! Service is super friendly and the coffee plus pretty great too. You can't go wrong with anything, and they're always ready with a recommendation if you need help deciding!</Text>

I really enjoyed this cafe. It’s a little cafe around the corner in South Pasadena. They have patio seating and free WiFi for guests. Benched chairs and tables for laptop users. Nice place to have coffee and get things done. Their mocha was a tad sweet but still great. I prefer this place over Starbucks. It’s just more comfortable and relaxing.</text>

It's a nice little place and the coffee is fine but the girl was so rude and acted like I was bothering her.    Who needs that?  Not me.< /Text>

Just a nice and mellow place. It's off the beaten path and just a treat to enjoy a cup of joe. They have a nice breakfast burrito, too. One of the best coffee houses. Starbucks blah!!</text>

Friendly service, good coffee, great hours. I love to have a savoury muffin with my coffee. Brand muffins are a little sweet for my taste but this is, by far, the best coffee shop in South Pasadena. And they roast their own coffee beans☕.<//Text>

awesome place, discovered it by chance one day and divorced the green corp coffeehouse that day!
Kelly is a coffee expert and knows her coffee, she always has a variety of different coffee's from different regions of the world brewing. the rest of the menu is small but excellent. the sweet shot is my favorite drink, its an espresso shot with whip n caramel,  mmmmmmmmmmm.
stop by sometime, you will not be disappointed!

Charlie's. Yes, they were able to cater to my low budget and my coffee needs! Having walked all around those Highlands in LA, I didn't see a single coffee shop anywhere. How could this be? Am I in a Twilight Zone? But wait! There is a place. Charlie's to the rescue. ♡<//Text>

I really want to like this place, I really do. It is a short 5 minutes walk from me instead of 5 mins drive to Cafe Leche. But the coffee is just too inconsistent. I have tried Charlie's about 4 times in the last 3 years. Each time I said no more but the desire to support local business implore me to give it one more try.

Today's coffee is Guatemalan, my favorite beans in the world. It was weak and tasted bland.

Oh well, back to my 5 minutes drive.<//Review>

<Review>All in all a great experience!  I didn't have a pink slip.  It wasn't a problem.  The instructions provided were easy to follow.  The tow driver was pleasant.  The forms to fill out weren't much.  Soon after taking  my truck I got my tax credit form and vacation hotel credit.  I'm happy donating to Kars4kids. Thx!</Review>< pics>

Experience was very efficient.  Made an online request and was contacted the next day to schedule pickup of vehicle.  All paperwork was taken care of by Kars4Kids.< /Review>

<text>Very easy process--almost too easy that I was a little suspicious. Had a car that needed some work, but didn't want the hassle of selling. Donating was a win-win as it helps a good cause and was a painless process to remove the vehicle from my possession. Everything went as described on their website.</text>< pics>

<review>Seamless process. I submitted a request and got a same day response with a pickup time only 24 hours later. They towed the car, processed all the DMV paperwork, and sent me the proof of sale. They communicated via my preferred channel of email, so I spent less than an hour total. I would almost have paid for this level of service!<//review>< username>

Left the signed title and keys in the glove box and the car was picked up hassle free. Will use this service again and will recommend to all my friends.< /review>< response>

<Text>Kars4Kids is amazing! I filled out the online form and received a text message the very next day about pickup! Shortly after I received a call from a local tower and he said he was 30 minutes out. 30 minutes later he arrived, I handed him the keys and title and that was it! Wonderful experience and would recommend to anyone who has an old car to get rid of.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

They made the process really simple and easy!
My only conflict was that the original instructions for the donation asked me to leave my keys and pink slip in the car wherever it was parked.

For many areas that is not wise or possible. It was a hassle to get a hold of the right branch to request that they give me a call when they arrived so that I could pass off the keys + paper in person.

Outside of this snafu it was very simple and everyone was really helpful and nice! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!<//review>

I purchased a new car and for four years I kept telling myself that I would finally sell my old car. Finally that day never came and decided to donate. I looked for an organization that was willing to take it off my hands and after submitting information to many other places not one followed though like you guys did. After I submitted my application on line literally 30 seconds later I received a call from JT& sons towing company. They were so professional and willing to working with me. They immediately scheduled car to be picked up two days later and a week later I received all the paper work on email such as transfer of tittle and tax deduction info. I am so so so impressed by you guys. Fast, efficient, and through. Thank you for making it easy to donate. Because of this my partner donated her car as well. Thank you and keep up this amazing work!  If I could give you guys 10 stars I would. 👍< /review>

< review>
I tried to donate a car but it was very confusing and difficult to get through the online chat.  This was my first point of contact.  I just had basic questions about logistics.  In mid conversation the agent would simply disappear.  then after much silence a new one would pick up the conversation.  This happened twice with no explanation from either agent.  Finally a third agent came on.  I explained what happened and said I was surprised to have a third agent.  I was somewhat thankful as the first two could not answer even the most basic questions such as what days/hours can I arrange a pick up.  All I got was "usually this and maybe that"...nothing definite.  After sitting there for three more minutes waiting on direction form the third agent I figured we were cut off.  I wrote to check.  No, she was still there....but no questions/directions/answers to my previous question in the chat.  I gave up.  I just wanted an easy donation and the most basic information.  I will now find another place to donate my classic Mercedes.<//review>

It was surprisingly easy to donate my car.  I was a bit insecure about the liability I might have had but your organization was so very organized that all my fears dissipated.  They you for a very pleasant experience as well as the chance to do some good for children (our future)...<//Review>

<Review>First tried to donate this car through Salvation Army, which was a fiasco that took over 2 weeks and resulted in a parking ticket. Gave up on that and reached put to Kars for Kids...  it was easy all around - the survey about the car was simple, they communicated when they said they would,  everything was transparent, and the car was gone in three business days. They did all the paperwork,  I just handed over the title to the driver. If you have a car that doesn't run but you'd like to donate it so it can do some good, this was a great option.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The car got picked up and the reciept for it went through, ultimately adding up to a nicely sized taxed deduction of $500. The only issue was scheduling the pickup of the car. Either they missed my calls or I missed theirs. Other than that, pretty solid.</Review>

Had an old car with a few problems that would be way to expensive to fix.  Kars4kids picked it up and hauled it away.  It was the easiest automobile transaction I've ever had.  Everyone from the customer service reps to the tow truck driver were professional and courteous.  Great organization!  I'll keep them in mind for any future donations.</review>

<review>HAPPY TO HAVE DONATED THE CAR
We had a little drama at the beginning but it was resolved on day 2 and all is well.  I was helping a tenant and now I know exactly what is required in the way of paper work.  The person did not have a title and we had to get a copy of that and she did not bring the current registration downstairs.  Day 2 we had both- texted over and all went well.  i want to personally thank James for taking the bull by the horns and got everything coordinated.</review><Rate>5< /Rate>< response>

Everything about our donation of a car went smoothly.  Everyone we communicated with was both professional and friendly, and that includes the driver  who picked up our car.  You're very impressive, all of you.< /Text>

It was great to help kids, and it was easy to give.  Their pickup was quick and efficient.  Best donation I make in 10 years.  Called an hour after I notified them, and my car was picked up the next day.< /Text>

Kars4Kids was very flexible to help me. From the start to finish they helped with the paperwork, car pick-up, and everything in between. I would definitely recommend them not only for their great social mission, but also their implementation for making it as easy as possible to make a difference by streamlining all the action-steps towards making a car donation!</Review>

<review>I wanted a charity that would respond quickly to remove my damaged car from my garage.  I had called several charities and Kars4kids took care of everything within 3 days (as long as you have the registration and title): the paperwork, the towing pickup and constant communication by email.  The towing company also picked up very fast. So far no problems.
Just waiting for the final receipt that's coming in the mail.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

K4K gave immediate responses by chat and by email, answered all my questions, and made it easy to arrange car pickup.  The guy who called (next day) and showed up (on time) to collect my car was very friendly and helpful.  I really miss my old car, but feel that I have helped a first-class organization that really has its act together.<//Review>

It was easy setting up the appointment to pick up the car via their website.  Once completed, the towing firm called to set up the date/time for the pickup.  They come with toll truck so no requirement to have the thing in running condition.  Light paperwork (we didn't even have the title - no problem) and they were on their way.

Great job.<//Review>

<rating>2<//rating><review>It seems a little dishonest- they lure you in with the promise of a vacation voucher at no cost to you except for the taxes. Then once you donate, they send you the "vacation voucher" which asks for a $50 deposit sent by check to some company. Once they get the check, they will call you to book. Not what I expected, not what was explained. Very disappointed. I won't be donating again.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808580eb00000001:0x280e2985a4ab1a09</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Two weeks back, I received a call from my mechanics that the engine in one of our SUV has given up. The car is not worth to repair in his opinion. I was stunned and has no idea what to do with this car. Luckily the mechanics suggested Kars4kids. I called them. The experience is super smooth. Not only they helped me to remove the dead car from the parking lot within two days, with simple and easy paper work. I also received an email, at a surprise, to tell me how much it was sold so I can deduct the same amount as donation. While I have always enjoyed donation experience, this is by far the best, beyond expectation. Thank you, Kars2kids!<//review>

Kars4Kids is awesome. They were quick to get back to me about my donation. Within three days of my initial contact to Kars4Kids my ugly old van was picked up right out of my driveway. This is a good organization. In the last three years I have donated four cars and will continue to do so in the future for the kids.</Text>

JT was WONDERFUL!! He came a day earlier than we had scheduled which worked for me. He was great & I could tell he is so committed to Kars4Kids. I pray that my donation will help 'our kids'. If anyone ever ask me about donating cars, I will definitely recommend you. Thank you for all you do.

The people I came in contact with were very professional with how they conducted their business.
I started with the question, " What do I need to do to donate my car?". I had to answer a series of simple questions and 48 hours later, I'm saying a tearful goodbye to my '95 Subaru which stopped working.
I spoke to other donation places I found on the internet first, and that was a waste of time. Start with Kars4kids because they're helpful, and easy to talk to.
Title is everything. You can't give it away if you can't prove it's yours.</review>

Sorry for my late response & comment that was unavoidable.
At any rate for your info, I am so satisfied by your prompt response
and your true to your word particularly your towing contractor, JT & Son.
I was having difficulty in setting up a most convenient time & day for
pick up of my car to be donated. In spite of busy schedules for JT  on
a Saturday or Friday evening pick up, he was willing to forego his family
chores over customer service. I chose Friday evening so he won't disappoint
his son's Saturday day soccer game. I salute you JT! More power to you.
God bless!

P.s.
I commend your organization and personnel . More power to you as well.</text>

<review>I reached out for assistance for a revision on my insurance policy that needed to corrected in a short timeframe.  I got connected with Kimberley and she was professional, kind, super helpful & fast in responding to my request.  Even when I had to call her back to ask for another revision after she's helped me the 1st time.  She's quick to send me the 2nd update.
Steven's been my agent for 10+ year and I've always received excellent care from him or his team every time I reached out for help!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We have been with this agent for over 10 years and their customer service and response time has been unprecedented.  Never had I encountered an agency that has better service quality as Steven Wang's office, especially Audrey who has gone above and beyond with personal reminders and always considerate of trying to help me save money. She has treated my family like her own, catering our policy plan to only what we need and not for the benefit of their office. My family member was also under State Farm with another agent however the quality of their customer service was not satisfactory. So I recommended they switched agent to Steven Wang's office and they said it was the best decision they've made for their insurance needs. Thank you, Audrey, for always being there to ease our minds and being so patient in answering our mountains of questions.</review>

Kimberley is efficient, responsive and very patience in answering all my questions.  Other people in the office are courtesy, helpful and polite.  Best customer service when compared to other places where I've been shopping for quotes, which I think it's the most important criteria when it comes to my insurance.<//Review>

Their service is very good and they provide mandarin speaking agent service. That's very important if you are encountering car accident, you really want to get help without language barrier. I recently had two claim in a row, I am very satisfied with how StateFarm handling my claims. Don't go to cheap insurance company, trust me.< /text>

We recently changed to Steven Wang agency. For the past 2 days, Jacky Yeh was very helpful with explaining the policy for my 2006 Accord mileage discount... as well as giving advice for my policy in general. Very courteous, professional, and attention to detail! I am very satisfied with the hospitality and attention to customer needs! Keep up the great job!!! Definitely going to stay with this State Farm agent!< /Text>

I walked in to the office on a whim while running errands in the same plaza. My insurance policy with another company was up for renewal so I wanted to see what State Farm had to offer. Kimberley was great to work with and I was in and out of the office in only 30 minutes!

I showed her what my previous policy was offering and she was able to build a policy with State Farm with better coverage at a significantly less price too. I am glad I decided to walk into their office and will be working with Kimberley for any of my future insurance needs.</Text>

< review>
Steven Wang and his associates go the extra-mile to earn your insurance business.   For example, my policies never get canceled due to non-payment, as Steven Wang's office text me on the day the policy expires to remind me to pay.  Recently, Audrie asked me what the mileage was on my car.  It was low.  She reported it and saved me $80 per year.   In addition, everyone is knowledgeable and helpful when I contact the office.</review>

I have had a great experience with this agency. Kimberly helped me out and showed great service and respect. She answered all my questions thoroughly even when I asked them again for reassurance. I definitely recommend to speak with her especially for first time buyers! Will definitely recommend this to others. Thank you Kimberly greatly appreciated.</Review>

<text>Professional and friendly staff. When you call them, they always take their time to explain everything clearly. One time I forgot to log my mileage for a discount, someone personally called/emailed to remind me. I particularly enjoyed working with Kim. She personally followed up to ensure all proper documentation was submitted for the underwriter. They are also multilingual, which is a plus for a diverse city like Irvine. Highly recommended!</text><user_name>Joseph Du (天鵝美食 White Swan Cuisine)<//user_name><time>1489729319417</time><GmapID>0x80dcdc45096bd523:0x40e503873de67ff3< /GmapID>< pics>

<Text>Bima was very helpful. He has excellent communication skills and we appreciate his direction with our insurance situations. Hopefully, he will keep us posted if we can save on any of the six policies we have with State Farm.

Thank you.

Honestly, when you are shopping around for insurance, you are looking for great coverage at a reasonable price and that is what you will find at this State Farm. Out of all the insurance companies, I found State Farm's policies and pricing to be the most appealing. I highly recommend my insurance agent, Bima P. He is very attentive to what your concerns are for the insurance you are looking for and is very willing to work with you to find a suitable solution. 5/5.< /text>

This office is great.  I worked with Bima Praswiditomo and he has been extremely helpful in switching my plan over from Colorado to California.  He took the time to sit down with us and explain any differences in cost, tried to find savings for us, and has the patience to go through all my questions and the options I wanted to consider (I had a lot).  He is always quick to respond when I have questions or try to change my policy.  Overall excellent service and Bima has been exceptionally helpful.<//Text>

Bima Praswiditomo has been a real asset in providing clarity of explaining policy in everyday terms. User friendly language is so welcoming as a non-insurance customer needing comparisons. I was able to request the tempo of speed at which he spoke to me to be slowed so I could hear words articulated in my comfort zone. I said “ you know your script, but I’m struggling to comprehend the knowledge you are attempting to impart to me”
Bima was most accommodating and very polite and hospitable.

Definitely a "good neighbor"

We've been with State Farm for over a couple of decades, primarily because of Steven Wang, and his friendly Staff.

From the moment we signed up for auto insurance, we've added many various lines over the years during our personal review of our situation along the timeline of this thing called life. Not only in the good times when we are on solid ground (knock on wood, as we're in Southern California!) but even when we've had a major claim on our home. We definitely appreciate the answers to our many questions during these moments and appreciate the human aspect Steven and his Staff exhibit towards my family.

We continue hitting new milestones and recently a major one happened: adding a teen driver to our policy (Yay! ...we now have a personal Uber driver!). Kimberly and Bima walked us through our options so we could choose the best route, while at the same time cross-checking our coverages to make sure the current situation matched our expectations for coverages. Just in this short duration of friendly conversation, we were able to discover yet another discount that we now qualified for (thanks, Kimberly and Bima, for taking the time to chat outside of the "just insure our son" scenario).

We've always felt welcome in working with Steven and his Staff, and we look forward to future conversations in many years to come!

I encourage those looking for an office of insurance professionals to seriously consider speaking with Steven and his Staff, and just get to know them!</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) In July last year, Aki S. helped me transfer my car and house insurance to Steven's Office. They are very professional. I bought an IUL index life insurance from another company before. Steven was very patient to help me review the policy and explain to me some of the problems with this policy. I am very grateful to Steven for helping me in time, otherwise IUL will lose a lot of money, it is impossible to help me with the pension, and in the end there will be no way to get compensation.

去年7月份Aki S.帮我把车子和房屋保险转到Steven的Office，他们很专业。之前在别的公司买了个IUL指数型人寿保险，Steven很耐心的帮我review的保单，跟我讲解这个保单存在的一些问题。很感谢Steven及时帮我，不然IUL会亏很多钱，根本不可能帮我养老，最后也没有办法拿到赔偿金。</Review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) I just immigrated to the United States. During the process of IRVINE and this insurance in Irvine, California, I felt the care of Steven Wang and StateFarm.

Like renting insurance, there are some information that I cannot confirm and want to consult. Steven will use statewide data to suggest what I can do; and when I want to find AGENT, I can find them in the city center and let me rent Don't worry about the housing process.

The car insurance was issued on the day of buying the car, allowing me to pick up the car quickly and worry-free; in the second month after buying the car, when my car was parked in the parking lot of the mall, I was hit and scratched. Because of the color of the car, I chose pearls White, this is a very special color, it will take a lot of effort to repair and take risks. Later, I consulted the judicial unit and the experience of STEVEN WANG's insurance professionals, and made the most suitable decision for me. I am very happy that this event has come to an end, and thank you for the professional advice provided by the judiciary and STEVEN WANG of STATEFARM.

I have been happily working with Steven Wang and StateFarm because of lease insurance and auto insurance. After all, I subjectively feel that many things in the United States are unpredictable. I also need to make plans for my future, so I also tried small life insurance with them. . The current expenditures are within my ability and everything in the United States is considered smooth. This peace of mind can also allow me to do other things I want to do, which is actually very good.

我剛移民來美國，在到加州爾灣IRVINE與這個保險過程中，感受到Steven Wang和StateFarm 的用心。

像是租屋保險，有些我無法確認並想要諮詢的資訊，Steven會用全州的數據建議我可以怎麼做；而且我想要找AGENT時，到市中心就能找到他們，讓我在租屋過程不用擔心。

買車當天即時出汽車保險讓我無憂的快速取車；在買車後第2個月，我的車停在商場的停車場時，被車子撞到擦傷，由於車子的顏色我選擇的是珍珠白，這是蠻特殊的顏色，要部份修整與出險會需要很多功夫。後來我諮詢了司法單位以及STEVEN WANG的保險專業從業者的經驗，做出了對於我最適合的決定。很高興這事情完整落幕，也謝謝司法機關和STATEFARM的STEVEN WANG提供的專業意見。

我由於租約保險和汽車保險都與Steven Wang和StateFarm合作愉快，畢竟我主觀覺得在美國的許多事情皆不可測，我也需要為我的未來做打算，所以也與他們試做了小額的人壽保險。目前的支出都在能力範圍內，在美國的一切也都算順利，這份安心也可以讓我開展其它我想做的事情，其實很好。< /review>

(Translated by Google) I have been in Steven for 8 years. Steven is very patient and experienced. My family car, house, and life insurance are all at State Farm. State Farm claims quickly and trustworthy. The economic person's service is careful, and the SMS will remind the expired unpaid policy. And regularly set up traffic safety workshops to provide a lot of convenient services for new immigrants like me.

我已经在Steven这保险8年了。Steven非常耐心，有经验。我全家汽车，房屋，人寿保险都在State farm 公司。State farm公司理赔迅速，值得信赖。经济人服务细心，会短信提醒过期未付款的保单。并定期开设交通安全讲习课，给我这样的新移民提供了很多便利服务。</Review>

Came in late for munchies and the girl with dark hair on Wed May 19 at 10:40pm she was very very nice. It was very busy so I knew to expect the wait. She was alone and doing a great job everything was delicious she deserves a promotion for dealing with everything alone with such grace. Even handled a difficult customer better then I could ever.</Text>

Dur-i-cious.... it's amazing.... its spectacular and mouthwatering..
It hits that spot that nobody knows about, 😉.
Drool city in this area.

LOL

But all kidding aside this area is a great place to go and it stays open late so it's a must if you have the munchies

But heaven like nonetheless.< /Text>

the last few times we’ve been going they aren’t cooking it fully threw and it’s really squishy. the staff don’t listen and take long to take your order. we had to ask for a lot of chocolate because they don’t put enough only drizzled on the top. one time they charged us extra for the 2 options of chocolates toppings but we wanted half half. it’s suppose to be one charge. sometimes they forgot to put the ice cream & the extra toppings we paid for. they even stopped doing the designs and everything is just looking sloppy. i used to come here all the time but after today it’s my last. whoever sees this comment i suggest going to choco fruit. same prices and better service :)</Text>

Pretty good tasting patries and candy from Europe and Middle east Turkish I believe. I always get the Belgium waffle with the sides of chocolate on the side. You can't go wrong with the white chocolate and pistachio chocolate it is amazing. Staff is super friendly and fast. This is your one stop shop for late night snacks like chocolate dipped strawberries and creepes.</text>

<review>Believe me, this place offer you the worst crepe in the world. I had a plate of crepe,waffle, and one more with Nutella and Belgium chocolate and pistachio topics all of them were really bad, the crepe was not fully cooked and made my stomach sick the waffle was too soft and the Belgium topic give me nausea because of being too sweet. My friend couldn't eating anything even 8 hours later. Do not be fooled by photos<//review>< UserId.>

Their Belgium milk chocolate mocha is delicious. It has a strong coffee flavor. I also had the lava cake and was not disappointed. We got samples of the cookie butter and it was great. I'll be back to try one of their loaded waffles.< /Review>

<Text>White or white passing people were acknowledged before me. I was waiting for over 15 minutes and the Baldheaded man ignored me. Only when a lighter Latino man was served before me and the Latino man and asked how long I had been waiting did I realize what was going on. He seemed 🤬 concerned and reminded the employees I had been waiting for service before him. He was still served first over me. The Employees were also looking at white female patrons in a lecherous manner.
My uncle is Caucasian and warned me a few weeks ago about not eating here. He noticed something was off with how darker patrons are made to wait behind white patrons even if they arrived first. I came back on my own and found out exactly why he wouldn't come back. I won't either.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1596119371976, 'text': "We're sorry about your experience.

Unprofessional. Was super awkward to order. Definitely overpriced; paid 12$ for 6 mini pancakes with barely any syrup on them. My sistah got a super thickk “crepe” that was very chewy... we were the only two there, the employee had the audacity to ask what my order was ???... this place made my inside turn. Wish I could put half a star or no stars at all.</review>

Was super excited to get some chocolate covered strawberries. I bought 9 strawberries. 20 dollars on 9 rotten strawberries. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. 9 strawberries and not one was good. So I basically spent 20 dollars to eat the tiny bit of chocolate surrounding the strawberry. This place will be out of business soon.<//Text>

< Review>
It's across the street from projects, so it doesn't feel safe to me, I have to really watch my back. I only stop there when I am close to empty, they need 2 cashier's, one to take money for the pump and one to take money for other things. People will ask for things one at a time and know its a long line of people waiting. They think that disrespectful *hit is funny. I only go there in emergency gas!<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a lousy place the gas pumps They do not accept debit or credit cards and apart from that you cannot enter inside the store to buy a drink, coffee or anything else, you have to order everything from an outside window and stand in line in the middle heat is very uncomfortable going there I do not recommend this gas station 👎

(Original)
Es un lugar pésimo las bombas de gasolina No aceptan las tarjetas de débito ni crédito y aparte no puedes ingresar adentro de la tienda para comprar una bebida un café o cualquier otra cosa todo lo tienes que ordenar desde una ventanilla de afuera y hacer fila en pleno calor es muy incomodo ir ahí no recomiendo esta estación de gasolina 👎<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2cbccec12576d:0x714dbb86543d5290<//Gmap_id></record>

Everything you'd expect from trader Joe's.  Clean, stocked, and always nice customer service.  The parking is limited for the store. Alternative paid meter parking is an option.<//text>

Not sure if the one across is for TJs as well. Anyway found my usual things. The lunch section was missing the item I was looking for which was a tuna sandwich I usually get from them but perhaps I just missed it due to the slightly different layout of the store. Anyway did some quick shopping and got my favorite corn dippers, wish they had the chick peas in the half can to go with it.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b50c7a923f5:0x4e06b32423486170<//Gmap_id><UserId.>107116999966676404762< /UserId.>< Date>

Trader Joe's takes the "sting" out of a nasty task.
All in one stop shopping and entertainment does the trick! Great art and clever wording everywhere you look make shopping a joyful experience.
This location is not usually overly crowded. Trader Joe's always draws nice people to their stores. They are a blessing to any community where they reside.</text>

I went there for a birthday cake and also to the Redondo location because the Torrance location had a line waiting to get in nearly wrapped around the corner. I got all the little things I needed there for the week except birthday cake and bought something close enough for my husband's quiet 35th.<//Text>

Food is fresh.  I can find things you can't find anywhere else.  The prices are great.  I am so sad there is no Trader Joe's close to my community.  I have to drive an hour to get to the closest.< /Review>

<Review>Trader Joe's is a fun place to shop! Their prices are very reasonable. I've found many unusual and yummy items there. Their tomatoes are better than any other stores. I'm really hooked on the frozen coconut squares. The prices on supplements are great! Checkout people are friendly, happy, and helpful! I can tell the employees are treated well.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><user_name>Cynthia Welna</user_name>< gmapID>

At this point, I was incredibly surprised when something popped up saying there was a TJ I hadn't reviewed.
It's Trader Joe's. C'mon. Shop at the place. Eat the food.

Why are you reading this? You're looking for a problem, aren't you? You won't find one in this review. Sorry to waste your time.</text>

The staff is friendly and very helpful.  The parking lot is always full so if you see a free parking space on the street, take it. There are paid parking if you don't mind footing out some change.</Review>< pics>

This Trader Joe's location has a pretty extensive hot and cold bar offerings, as well as a pizza station, among other things. They have very limited seating if you want to eat your grub there, and there isn't really anything nearby that can serve as an alternative.<//review>

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! This TJ's and all the workers there. They all offer to help you,  help each other, have fun at their job and generally make it a nice time to be there. And this is besides the fact that we love the foods, the flowers, the drinks, the prices ... thank you😊< /text>

I always go to a Trader Joe's wherever it's located and you can find one or two in a city. I love the variety of produce, the meat products and all the foodies not normally found in other stores! Always end up buying more than originally planned!< /Text>

<Text>I love the location and the employees are always so nice! But I am always waiting so long in the line! So my quick trip to the grocery store to grab one or two items easily turns into 15 or 20 minutes the majority of it waiting in line.</Text>< pictures>

The people who work there are super friendly and helpful especially when it comes to the drinks like the kumbacha
And they always have samples of different things everyday and the cost of the products are very low and they will let you sample a juice or whatever the drink you want to try fantastic place just wish they would bring back the dessert pizzas 👍<//Review>

<Review>I love TJs and I love this location. Good variety. Good value. I like seeing what they will have new. Sometimes I find something I like but it doesn't always continue to carry it. Good deals on cheese. I like the prepared foods like salads, pulled pork, frozen entres, chocolates, nuts. Fun to shop here.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dd4b50c7a923f5:0x4e06b32423486170<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Well its trader Joe's, if you haven't been to one then you should, as opposed to other ones, this one is small, I know they can't do much about that but it seems limited compared to other larger markets. And don't pull into the parking lot right out front, it's a nightmare, use the big one across the street and save yourself some time.</text></record>

<review>Usually awesome checkers. I bagged all my own items today and the guy had no personality whatsoever. Maybe he was having a bad day but I'm sorry if you're in the business of costumer service, put your problems aside and be friendly. The only thing he asked me is if I needed bags.

Traditional Trader Joes in the heart of tourist area of San Francisco. Great addition to the area for both tourist and convention attendees.< /Text>

Nick a star for small store and parking lot. Otherwise, same Trader Joe's you know and love, private label Trader Joe's items, fresh, organic produce, good wine and beer selections, etc.< /Review>

Its TJ's.  I think it's been here 35+ years.  Prefer it to the south Torrance location on PCH, seems a bit larger and I like the layout better.< /review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>If you don't know what Trader Joes stores are I suggest you check one out. If you like good food at very reasonable prices, with a few European touches like cheeses and wines, then this is a great place. Like many folks around here we get most of our produce from Joes, including hormone and antibiotic free meats. If you are avoiding corn syrup, like us, you will find more choice here than probably anywhere.
Comparing this to other Trader Joes, well the parking is a pain, and the store is a bit cramped.  However the staff are exemplary, always there to help.</text>< Pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Trader Joe's is a specialty grocer that offers quality food for very reasonable prices. This location is particularly challenging because it is smaller than the average Trader Joe's and the parking lot is almost aways full.

Just entering Trader Joe's is sometimes challenging. People are usually in a hurry and want to exit and I've often had to wait for a stream of people to go by before it's "safe" to enter.

The produce section is ok. Many items are in stryofoam trays wrapped in plastic wrap. I guess until they install scales the register, this will always be the case. Much of the produce is shipped from Mexico, Chile or New Zealand and so if you're looking for local produce, you probably won't find it here.

The freezer case is well stocked. They offer frozen prepared entrees and side dishes. Vegetables, meats, fish and desserts are also available in the two frozen cases.

This location has a pretty good selection of cheese. If you're looking to purchase appetizers for a party, this is a good place to come for that. Even the frozen case and some interesting items that make good 'last minute" hot appetizers.

The wine selection is average for a Trader Joe's and I wonder why they devote so much floor space for two buck Chuck (Charles Shaw).

Rush hour is in the late afternoons to early evenings. The best time to come to this location is when they open (either on the weekday or weekend).  Don't even think of coming here the evening before a major holiday like July 4 or Memorial Day.<//Text>< pictures>

I like this branch of Trader Joe's, as it is large enough to carry all the items I may need, and the employees are very friendly. The only complaint I have is the limited parking space.< /Text>

Average Trader Joe's. The parking lot is far too small  but there is a fair amount of parking across the street. The store itself is small but has the essentials. There always seems to be lots of staff and very friendly.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good selection, cheeses you will not find in other supermarkets. Huge selection of fruits and vegetables. Not everything packed in plastic.

(Translated by Google) Great organic shop with a good selection. The private label carbonated water really contains a lot of carbon dioxide ... great :-). The staff are friendly & helpful.

(Translated by Google) Very nice organic supermarket with many delicious, seasonal products. As a German Touri you will quickly find your way here and be reminded of domestic organic supermarkets.
