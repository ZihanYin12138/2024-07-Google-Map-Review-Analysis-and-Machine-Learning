< Review>
Had their sandwiches, they were not bad. Size was average. Had their donuts. Those are pretty good. A nice selection and a good variety. Also you will see donut flavors you would not see at other donut shops. They also have a ice cream selection. Some good flavors to choose from in the ice cream section.< /Review>

I go all the time. Sandwiches are so good I recommend anything on a croissant. Their drinks are delicious,normally I don’t care for frappe style drinks but their mocha ice blender is good and they have great fresh juice too. Their pistachio ice cream is real good too . And the service ! Always meet you with a smile and give great and fast service. The place is really clean as well .</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>It's amazing, I'm not sure if they are still offering it since I'm never around at that time, but the lunch special wings are amazing. Tony's donuts may have a small premium, but they are well worth it. Ever since I've had his donuts (especially the croissant donut) I have never looked at donuts the same. They are by far some of the best donuts I've had, with a great staff, and amazing owner; I really don't think you can beat Tony's donut.</Review>< pics>

I don't come here anymore. Used to come here for donut holes, croissant sandwiches & cravenuts. I don't see Tony anymore, but the two Asian women who took over noticed my folding bike under a table one day & said no bikes inside for dine-in customers. Sad.

At the Grand Opening Tony said he had a bike rack waiting to be installed, but I guess he never got around to it. Too bad.< /Review>

The service was good and the restaurant was very nice and neat. The food tasted good, I had a coconut banana fruit smoothie and a regular glazed raspberry filled doughnut</Review>

{'time': 1527736556916, 'text': "My apologies for your really bad experience. We do our best but I don't think I can get anyone to work for me if my requirement was for them to shave their entire body:) lol\n\nI am truly and sincerely sorry for the mess up with your smoothie. I am glad you received your refund and was such a gentleman about it.\n\nYeah a cake donut is nothing like a baked moist red velvet cake. Since it's fried the texture would never be like that. I will make sure to put up a label in your name to make clear to others that it's a donut, I don't want others to be confused and have a really bad experience like you had.\n\nAlso I am looking into my pricing for our banana split, you told my staff that $6.95 was too expensive. It's been $6.95 for the past 5 years. But I will look into it. maybe I can buy smaller bananas just for the split. Up or down I promise I will change the price by July 1st. So thank you for bringing that to my attention.\n\nI hope your sister's order came out ok. It would be double terrible if you both had a really bad experience.\nI hope that your post help you vent your anger, if not my friend has a 5 star in that field and I can refer you to him. I hope you appreciate that I am taking the time to address your review.  If there is anything that I can do to reverse your really bad experience don't hastate to ask, if it's within reason I just might be able to do it:)\n\nHave a good day"}</Response>

A great place for doughnuts. I say that this place really does have a run for it's money in comparison to other places in the San Gabriel Valley. The doughnuts are always fresh and the people are very energetic and attentive. My colleagues often make great comments about how great the doughnuts are.

I really wish Walnut, West Covina, and Diamond Bar would have this great establishment as well since these are doughnuts of great quality.<//text>

< Review>
The first time I went there it was because of an ad I saw in the baldwin park newsletter. My partner and I tried a donut with a nutella mousse in the middle. We could tell straight away that it was not actually nutella but rather some sort of powdery cocoa like nesquik. Did not like at all.

We gave it a second chance the other day, and this convinced us to never go back. We bought a different nutella donut d'crav and a strawberry cream cheese. The cream cheese did not taste like cream cheese at all. The more expensive d'crav advertised to contain nutella did not contain even a hint of it. We asked the woman there if the d'crav had nutella since that was part of its name. She replied in the affirmative, but once we tasted it we could immediately tell that the "nutella" was actually the cheap chocolate crap they put on their basic donuts. That wasn't even the worst part! Not only were the pastries not as described, but the cashier overcharged us for our order! The two pastries were 1.95 and 3.25 respectively, and the order came out to 7.66! We stood outside in the rain contemplating our receipt, and then we went in to ask about the price. The cashier gave us a confused look and checked on a separate register. She told us it was not the right price and tried to refund the credit card. When she did that she so happened to come upon an error where our receipt from nine minutes ago did not show up. Finally, she said her machine was "stuck" and that she couldn't refund the credit card because she couldn't find the receipt that we handed to her. How does that even happen? How did she even overcharge us to begin with? The difference in price was $2.44 and somehow she made the mistake of overcharging us by around %40 of the actual price. We got our refund in cash and left with a feeling that we had been robbed and misled. Not a good business at all!

If you want to get overcharged and have your receipts mysteriously disappear, Tony's will happily oblige. We plan on filing a complaint with our credit card company.<//Review>

<response>{'time': 1487451907473, 'text': "The nutella Cream filled donut is cream wipped with nutella. It's spread in the middle of a vanilla iced donut with chocolate stripes on it.\n\nThe Cravetella is $3.25 it's a fried croissant donut cut in half with nutella spreaded in the middle and powder sugar on top.  Was that the one they gave you?\n\nThe chocolate cravenut is a fried croissant donut with chocolate icing dip the same as the one we use on our donuts. And that is $1.50\n\nSo I am guessing by your description you received a Strawberry cheese croissant, and a chocolate cravenut. $1.95 + $1.50= $3.45\n\nIf you did get the powder sugar coated cravetella  (nutella spread) it would be $1.95 +$3.25 =$5.20\n\nI am at a lost on how they messed up and got $7.66 that ment they must have pushed something with tax on it. As far as our register is concerned it sucks, it's difficult and we are stuck with it for another 5 years:( just hoping the updates make it more user friendly.\n\nThank you anyways for trying us out twice. If there is anything I can do to make you your dream donut for your troubles let me know by messaging me on our facebook page."}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Great smog shop. They were fast and not too expensive. The staff was friendly and there was plenty of room for social distancing. They were wiping surfaces down and wearing masks, so that was nice. Great experience with two vehicles.</Text>< name>

Had both my cars smogged here. They were fast and efficient. One of my cars failed due to a bad catalytic converter, which had to be replaced. It then passed just fine the second time around. I'll be back here again.</Text>

Marty was on-time, professional, and quick.  He took on four separate jobs that we asked him to do and everything turned out great.  Once complete everything worked great and was left clean and ready for use.  Will definitely use AAP again if/when necessary.< /Text>

If you have challenging plumbing issue, I would highly recommend hiring Steven from AAP. We had a difficult problem to fix with our shower and instead of quitting or figuring out a shortcut solution, he took his time to do the job correctly and safely. He’s a super nice guy and showed genuine concern for us and pride in his work. We will definitely call him again for any other of our plumbing needs.</review>

<review>Our plumbing technician, Marty Flores, was on time and professional.  Excellent work and provided feedback each step in the repair process and showed us the defective parts being replaced/repaired.  We have some future plumbing work and will definitely reach out to AAP and recommend them to anyone else having plumbing issues.<//review></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I’ve used AAP several times at both my primary residence as well as my rental property. Their technicians have always been honest and upfront with me on their pricing and they always give me more than just one option or recommendation.  I’ve used other companies in the past and have had to learn the hard way that you can easily put together on a bad deal. With AAP I don’t have to worry about getting ripped off or having shoddy work done.  Every time I’ve needed to call their office I’m greeted by kind and professional staff. Carlos and Steven are two of my favorite technicians.  They’ve delivered exceptional work every time and are very professional, polite and highly skilled in their field.  I also love the fact that they are a veteran-led and woman-led business. As a female with multiple family members that are retired veterans and active duty, it truly means a lot to me.
I can always trust AAP with all my plumbing needs and I highly recommend them.< /Text>< Pics>

Wanted to give a shout out to our service tech Martin.
We had a problem with our shower faucet for our condo. We used Home Advisor and they got us in touch with AAP. Martin came out and went over our situation and clearly explained some options we had for fixing the problem.
He came back out the next morning just as we had set up and repaired the problem as we requested.
Martin was really great to work with and we really appreciate the time he took to explain everything to us. He did a great job and we are very pleased with his work.
Great job Martin. Thanks again.</Text>

< Review>
My parents have never had any plumbing issues. Today we woke up with all the water coming out of the tubs and toilets.  I called AAP and was told there was no cost to come to the house and a plumber can be at the house within 1 hour. I confirmed and Steven A arrived within the hour.  After spending some time with the main pipe line, Steven explain the issue, showed us through the camera and discussed costs. He was very professional and educational to us as well.  He cleaned and clogged what needed to be done and left an estimate of future repairs that should be done to prevent it from happening again. I 100% recommend him to others within the Jurupa Valley, Eastvale and Riverside areas.<//Review>

Steven, the AAP Home services plumber, came to my home and repaired one of our toilets which was leaking water from the tank to the bowl, and also was constantly running water slowly into the toilet tank.  Steven quickly determined the problem and replaced the toilet fill valve, as well as the flapper.  We have older model toilets in the home, and I asked for an estimate for replacing the toilets which Steven promptly gave to me.  I also asked Steven to replace a showerhead with one I had on hand.  The whole job took about 30 minutes.  I also asked him to look at the other toilet in the house as well and ensure that it was working properly, and did not need any repairs.  Steven indicated that it was working fine and didn't need any repairs.  I appreciated him not "upselling me" to unnecessary repairs.  It was a joy to watch him work efficiently and quickly--these jobs would have taken me hours and hours, and I would have been afraid that I would have made the leaking toilet worse.

Steven also cheerfully accepted a AAP Home Service gift card to partially pay the bill for the toilet repair.  I received this gift card as thanks from AAP Home Services, after having another job performed by the company in May of 2019 (to install a new natural gas line into my garage to run a gas dryer--no previous dryer had been installed in my house).  Carlos, the tech who installed that gas line back then, also did quality work on that job.

I sing the praises of AAP Home Services, in my opinion a quality company, with expert plumbers and gas line installers.  The only downside is that you might have to wait to get an appointment when you call.  I called on a Wednesday, and they couldn't schedule my appointment until Friday.  The company seems to be very busy, no doubt because of the quality work they do, which many repeat customers seem to know about.<//Review>

Martin and Carlos were a great team. They arrived punctually and performed a thorough leak detection. Afterwards, they explained how they planned to repair the leak and took their time to answer all my questions. They began right away and finished in a few hours.
Restoration is not included, but they try did try to minimize wall openings.< /Review>

BUYER BEWARE. The plumbers that do the work are great. The office is unprofessional and shady. I was told it would be flat rate $1200 to service my tankless water heater for the brand I have. So I asked for a flat rate sheet, they wouldn't provide. Then they had me talk to multiple different people giving me the run around, not appreciated. I asked how they come up with $1200 and nobody could show me where that number comes from. They don't listen to their customers, bad customer support, shady on how they price jobs (DOUBLE what other plumbers have quoted). And the sad part was that I had a great experience the first time which is why I was coming back to them....but never again.
ASK QUESTIONS if you plan to use these guys.<//Text>

Wow, what a great professional staff of people dedicated to their Company's protocols in this pandemic time and COVID19.  Over the last 3 years, starting with Terry, Cesar, Carlos & today Jerry, the men & women of AAP Plumbing have helped me since August, 2019 -- June 2020 & today 3/8/2021.  Carlos has serviced our many issues with over four calls and follow ups, that have helped us immensely with leaks, faucets, toilet and garbage disposal issues.  If, I have an issue, Carlos listens to me and honestly tells me, the best resolution for the current plumbing issues & offers me a Senior discount, which is greatly appreciated.  "Thank-You, AAP"  for yet another job well done,
Regards,

This is the third time I've had work done by AAP and have never been dissatisfied.  AAP will always be my first and only company I call for my plumbing needs.</Text>

<review>AAP very polite and friendly to deal with. They kept in contact with me to keep me informed as to the schedule and expected arrival time of the technician Luis, who arrived within the expected arrival window. Luis was very knowledgeable and explained the whole process that he was going to be using on our drains. The work was done in a quick manner and within the estimated time frame. I would definitely reccomend them to my friends and would call on them regarding any other plumbing issues.</review></record>

<Review>AAP has been there for me for all my plumbing needs for years. Emergency and otherwise. They aren't the cheapest service. But they have always sent me people who come with lots of knowledge and experience and when the job is done, I feel satisfied that it has been done right. My latest issue, a busted water heater, was handled by David H. & Dylan very professionally. They even had to create a temporary set up for the tank so other crews can work on the damage. They made sure to get it right so that we could function in our home during the course of the clean up. They even, and without hesitation, got another water heater tank, when the first one arrived with a couple minor dents that I believe others would have just let slide by. Little things like that go a long way.  They completely back their work. And of course, their 24/7 availability is great when it's an emergency.<//Review>< Name>

<Review>Me and my wife just bought our first home. David and Dylan (and Issac) completed an extreme overhaul of our plumbing in an extremely short amount of time. I highly admire their work ethic, attention to detail and wonderful customer service. At the end of all the work, they took the time to educate me and my wife on all the upgrades/changes that were made and proper maintenance. I feel very fortunate for the service AAP provided. Highly recommended!< /Review>< user_name>

Other places I called required a down payment before hand so I was pleased with this option and decided to give them a try. The job was to have my faucet and garbage disposal replaced.

They contacted me 30 minutes prior to arrival which I found assuring.  The secretary also provided the technician's name who would be arriving before he did.

Upon arriving, I must say Ceser looked professional and ready.  He placed on his booties to not track any dirt in my house from the outside.  He looked at the job, gave me a price and time estimate for completion of the job, and I pleasantly agreed.  The prices were comparable to other plumbers in the area, but  I was so impressed from their professionalism and punctuality, it was easy for me to agree and allow him to go forward.

End result?  I couldn't be more pleased.  Cesar is a rockstar and the job was finished before I knew it.  Everything was immaculate, and he even made sure the sink was cleaner than the way he found it..lol. If I should need any services that requires AAP assistance, I will not hesitate to give them a call first.  I can have peace of mind that the job will be done expeditiously and correctly.

Out the gate the team at AAP was simply remarkable! On the phone, Arie was very quick, helpful, prompt and attentive. All of my questions were answered thoroughly, and best of all, service was scheduled within minutes. Steve, the technichian, was at my door 45 minutes later. Steve was a great in his own right. He was  courteous, professional, and knowledgeable. He got the job done quickly and made it look easy! Thank you team AAP, you truly saved my Sunday.< /Text>

<Review>AAP is a very professional company. The servicemen are polite and informative. Their rates are very reasonable and they always answer when you call and have a great response time for emergency situations. I have used them for replacing a toilet and fixing a broken water pipe inside of a wall. It is great to have a reliable plumber to use and I will always call AAP when I have a plumbing issue. I just found out that they do heating and a/c work too! I know it is hard to go online to chose a plumber, but you will be happy that you called All American Plumbing!!  (I also wrote a review on Review Buzz).  These guys won't disappoint!!!</Review>< rate>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>A pipe burst in my house under the cement slab and after calling at least 10 plumbing companies in my area, Mike L. was the only one who said he could be there in a half an hour and answered his phone and was still in business. Not only did he show up within the half hour, but immediately could diagnose what the problem was and with great clarity could describe what needed to be done and was able to give me options regarding cost. Because of the late hour of the day, he arrived promptly the next morning  with a professional crew and they were able to re-route all the old pipes in one day. At all times Mike L. was very professional, polite and sympathetic as was the rest of the crew. I highly recommend Mike L. in particular as well as All American Plumbing.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I contacted AAP for service and within 45 min Josh came to my home. Within 15 min he diagnosed the problem,  went over it with me and fixed the issue needing only to replace my shower head.  Josh from AAP  was very knowledgeable,  had excellent customer service and most of all fixed the problem efficiently.

<Review>I had an emergency leak and contacted AAP like we always do.  Carlos showed up very quickly and found the leak and repaired it saving us from further damage to our home. We have used AAP several times before and have found them to be honest and fair with their pricing.  We recommend AAP to friends & family, Thanks again Carlos for your professionalism and expertise and a job well done.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Absolutely the best plumbing company there is.   William and Daniel were so skilled.  How do you fix a leak encased in a tomb of concrete?  They did it in 1 day.   Save valuable time and call AAP  All American. The girls in the office are so sweet.  Joanna and Ari.   More review to follow when my PC isn't having her atitude.<//review>

Called in and spoke with someone who got a tech to call me back. Spoke with tech arranged appointment for the next morning. Prior to my appointment the office calls to tell me they don't service my area. They can blame it on who ever, but it goes without saying it starts at the top. Training is needed on everything including all employees knowing where you do and dont service. Now I drove an hour for nothing and I'm desperately trying to find a replacement the morning of. For those considering this company I'd suggest getting a 100% guarantee on everything or else you to could get a call where they fall short of what they already promised. Good Luck!< /Review>

It was Thanksgiving Eve and counting.  My sink had been stopping up for 3 days.  I finally gave in and called Steve.  I was not sure that I could find someone so late on Thanksgiving eve.  Steve came.  He was a life saver.  He unstopped my sink with friendly and professional courtesy.  I have not had any difficulty with the sink since his visit.  I would not hesitate to call him again.  The customer service rep, Paula was also friendly and reassuring.< /text>

< Review>
I've used them 3 times. Great customer service. They were on time for the most part. But review the amount i paid for a hot water heater, a reroute of a water pipe and a quote for a leak, which they say is a leak from my hot and cold lines.  Which turned out to be a leak from somewhere else.  I feel they OVER charged me tje 2 times I've paid for their services. The work was good. They were professional. One tech even fixed something for us that we didn't ask for. Was a minor job but was cool he did that.  Get a second opinion if u want to use them. Then if all is ok. I would definitely go with them. Also twice they have recommend that i do a home repipe when that is not necessary for a house that has 15 year old copper piping.< /Review>

Came home late Monday evening to find my side yard flooded.   Not knowing what to do or who to call I looked in the phone book.  The first company I called could not be bothered.  I called AAP-All American Plumbing and they said they would be there within the hour and they were.   Rick and Mike addressed the problem with me and gave me several options.  They gave me a quote that I thought was more than fair for the work they would be doing.   They showed up right on time the very next morning, worked very quickly and unobstrusively, finished much earlier than I anticipated with the job, cleaning up after themselves and putting everything together the way it was.   I thought the guys were very professional and straightforward and my major problem was solved within hours.  Nobody wants to come home to a problem with a broken water pipe, but these guys made it a much less stressful situation.   I HIGHLY recommend calling this company for any plumbing issues you may encounter.
Great job and very, very affordable price.   Thank you All American Plumbing and thank you Mike, Rick and Mike!!!!!!< /text>

First I would like to say that I do not normally go out of MY WAY to leave a review.  All American Plumbing had the best price but the tech Michael Munoz is what made the experience the best.  He was on time, knew what he was doing and got the job done.  Very professional...unfortunately I know I have plumbing issues and seems at least once a year I need some type of service.  I will continue to use All American and request Michael to do the work.  I have used bigger "brand name" companies only to be greeted by a tech that made me feel I was an inconvenience to him and paid higher prices.  I hope that Michael Munoz receives proper recognition for his professional and knowledgeable service.  Thanks!</Text>

I dunno about there service, but they never return calls. I've contacted them twice this week. I asked for the manager, was told he was in a meeting. My number taken, no return call. I telephoned the following day and the reception was surprised to know no one had called me back. Reception said she'd give him another message, as he was now out to lunch. That was 4 days ago...</Review>

Woke up this morning with a slab leak in my closet. Called AAP and there was a technician (Michael Munoz) at my house in an hour.

Michael was very helpful, clean and polite, answering all my questions and wasting no time in getting the work done.

My water was back on by 2pm and all work was complete by 3pm.

I would highly recommend AAP and Michael to anyone, and will be calling them again when the need arises.

Mark was professional and efficient. I have already set up an appointment for a separate problem. AAP is my go to company for plumbing issues now.

When he finally arrived, he did not bother to check. Just a look at the brand GE Whirlpool, he said that the brand is bad. Without checking the problem, he claimed that he would have to order the parts which would take 3-4 days; then it would take him 3-4 hours to fix it, and the cost would be $300-$450. Instead, he recommended to install a new one for $1200. Bad service. We googled for solution to our problem, got the part from Home Depot which costed $14, and it took 1.5 hours (for someone who is not experienced). The water heater is now fixed on our own. We would have given no star for the service. Do not use this company's service!!!!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dcb500d62bfcef:0x554ddd877e7a72d</GmapID></record>

I contacted the owner and they sent out Gabriel to do the work at our house. The water heater is a power vent system and there are many parts to this water heater system compared to the standard ones. The tech was trying to check for issues within all aspects of the heater, and found that the burner assembly was out. Instead of trying to go for the largest invoice and sell me on a new water heater, the tech gave me options which I liked. He told me the advantages and disadvantages and was supportive on both options he recommended and didnt pressure me, I felt I bought something rather being sold on something. I also wasn't home and my wife is 35 weeks pregnant, and she had no problems working with their staff and made everything smooth. I highly recommend them as they came out the next day and fixed our water heater issues. Questions were answered, problems were solved, and the hot water is back. And for anyone who might complain about time of arrival (though he arrived on time, and even if he didn't), remember, they are going from job to job, and I would rather have them stay at their previous job to make sure it is all right and then come to my house. If the tables were turned, I would want the same treatment.<//text>

My neighbors in our condo complex have had to use them several times in the past two years. And only once did they ever announce they would be turning off the water and give an expected time to turn it back on in the six or seven times they've been out. AAP might be okay with plumbing. But they seem to enjoy causing problems while there and after they're gone more. Seeing how their customer service handles multi-family buildings, I'll be calling someone else when the time comes.<//Text>

Initially we had an issue with scheduling. However, after speaking to both the owner and the service tech (who contacted US)... we were able to reschedule for the following day. The tech was courteous,professional and knowledgeable about not only his task at hand, but his trade in general. Even after the initial "hiccup" this company has made lifelong customers. Thank you!< /review>

We had a problem with sewer back up in Corona, CA mobile home. After we called, AAP Home Services sent out 2 plumbers for camera inspection services FREE estimate then they gave me a low price on camera inspection service so we go ahead with the camera inspection. After the broken section of sewer line was found out, they gave me an estimate for fixing the problem with a guarantee. After we agreed on the price, they started breaking concrete, digging a hole 5ft deep, 2ft wide and 3ft long, fixing sewer line, refilling dirt and redoing concrete. The whole process from inspection to accomplishing the repair took them only half working day.
I could not believe of their speed. I felt very fortunate to have diligent, honest, years of experience and professional manner of Carlos Rocha and his helper. I can assure that you will not be disappointed if you have a chance to be served by these 2 particular professional plumbers< /Text>

I discovered a hot spot on my kitchen floor at 10:00 pm on Tuesday night.  When I got up on Wednesday morning there was water visible on the floor.  Michael and Drake came to check it out early Wednesday afternoon.  It was a slab leak.  I had no idea what to expect from this situation, but Michael and Drake talked me through it and put my mind at ease.  In just a few hours they had stopped the leak and re-routed my water lines above ground.  They were both very respectful and courteous and they did a great job of cleaning up after their work was done.  I definitely trust AAP and will not hesitate to call them again for any future problems.<//Text>

Michael Nunoz was very professional.  He gave me a free estimate, containing itemized items, their cost, and time length to complete the job. On the agreed upon time Michael was very prompt and showed up on time; something very important for us because it show he respects our time. Michael did a very good, thorough and clean job. He installed out toilet, tested it and kept our place very clean. Michael was very consciencious and focus in his job. He finished the job in good time. Thanks Michael</text>

< Review>
Our contact with AAP was a positive experience; from our initial call to the technician's departure. Technician Michael Munoz was very professional and personable.  His diagnoses of our problem was an honest assessment of possibilities and probabilities. He made some suggestions (which we headed) and replaced an outdated water pressure regulator (which we needed).

Michael arrived on time, was well dressed and mannered. He listened to our layman's description of the problem and then undertook the repair of the part that most likely caused the leak. He was a pleasure to do business with.

I appreciate the employee who displays the honesty and proper work ethic that the owner would display himself if he had answered the call for service.  We now have a plumbing company in our rolodex to go to as long as we live in San Dimas, CA.< /Review>

<Review>It was such a pleasure to have Yost Appliance fix my stove.  When I first telephoned, I knew I was in good hands as they were able to come the very next day.  They were prompt, professional and very knowledgeable.  A part was ordered and they were back to complete the repair in a day.  They could not have been more responsive!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>The repair man at Yost recommended replacing our existing oven. I gave him the homeowner's number. A week goes by. I called Yost and asked about the status. He didn't remember me and tried to hand the phone off to the receptionist. I said, "you and I spoke" and reminded him again of our conversation. He cut me off and said out loud "this is for you (the receptionist)," and just gave the phone to her. So completely unprofessional! and left us without a working oven for over two weeks (while we find another repair company).<//text><gmapID>0x80e914e1df95ff23:0xe3db9edaa364ddbb<//gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

This family owned and operated business was so wonderful to work with!  The secretary who is also Mr. Yost’s wife was very sweet, organized, and efficient at getting an appointment set quickly for us.  Mr. Yost and his son arrived punctually to our scheduled  appointment and were able to diagnose and quote repair within minutes of examining our appliance.  I felt extremely confident that they knew exactly what they were doing and that they were highly capable of fixing the issue.  Within an hour they had our product up and running (and clean, yes they even cleaned our machine)!  Both father and son were very professional and extremely nice to work with.  I was so lucky to find this company and reach out to them.  I cannot say enough positive things about my experience with them.  I would refer them in a heartbeat to anyone I know and I will for sure reach out to them whenever I have any other appliance issue arise.  I felt they were very reasonably priced as well. I highly recommend contacting them with any appliance issues you may have.  Five stars!< /Text>

Avoid. Wrong diagnosis (minimum diagnosis charge $65). Not interested in giving quote. Not interested in fixing my washing machine as older than 7 years (has had very light use).
Fixed by another repair person for minimum labor plus $50 part.
Yost said that he had not seen this Kenmore front loading washing machine model. Another Goleta friend has the same model.
Yost diagnosis was that the drum needed replacement. He said the drum had dropped and that the bearings had worn out. The drum was in the same position it had always been. The drum could not be moved up and it did not rattle (as the online video repairs showed it should if the bearings had worn/were gone). The bearings were not more noisy than usual when the drum was manually rotated.
Yost said he could not repair it. Did not know the cost of replacing the drum assembly. Was not interested in giving me a quote.
Did not even take the back of the machine off to access drum. Other repair person during their diagnosis. No tell tale rust or anything.
Yost turned up an hour late, Friday at 11.30am. Understandable in these Covid-19 times.
But he was barely there 5 minutes and I had been told when booking the appointment, that his half hour lunch started at 11.30.  I did offer that I would wait till after they had had lunch.
Clearly not interested in repairing it.
It was a worn out door catch $50 (Original Equipment Manufacturer part from Midway on De la Vina).
To their credit, when I called Yost today about placing this review, their contact lady did offer to "make it right". She has been unfailingly courteous and professional. I declined her offer as I have no faith in their expertise and not interested in their explanation/re-interpretation of the facts.
I thought a diagnosis cost of $65 is a reasonable cost compared to what Sears used to charge. But if Yost are never going to be interested in repairing washing machines older than 7 years, then you are throwing your money away.<//text>

They told my friend's tenants to buy a new stove . . .
Yost appliance repair guy said he wasn't interested in the job.
On phone new repair guy said order a new stove handle possible.
That's all it needs.  Plus some cleverness . . .

june 18, 2020 followup:
the new appliance repair firm guy used a couple of screws and
reattached the glass to the stove door from inside the oven
door..  no new handle, no new stove required.</Review>

<text>Edit to my review: Mr. Yost called me, apologized, asked me what he could do to make things right, and offered to send me a 100% refund. He clearly cares about serving his customers well, and he felt bad that I wasn't happy. Honesty like that is hard to come by these days, and I appreciate him standing behind his work.

Original review: Unfortunately I have to report a pretty negative experience with Yost Appliance Repair. My front-loading washer wouldn't drain, and Mr. Yost (and his son) came out to take a look. They told me that the pump was ruined, it would cost >$400 to fix because they have to take the whole washer apart, and it would probably re-clog with whatever got in it in the first place. They also went on a tirade about how front-loaders are less efficient, unreliable, can't be fixed, and are being foisted on us by "the Europeans". They charged me for a service call, which is fair, and left. So then I went online, and everything I can find disagrees with their assessment of front-loaders. I also found some YouTube videos showing how I could access the pump through a window in the bottom. I didn't even need to take it out; by running the washer a few times, and wiggling the rubber piece that feeds into the pump, I was able to get the pump to clear the jam. It is now working reliably again.

I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1, because (1) they came out quickly, and (2) they tried running the washer a couple times before deciding it was broken, which helped me figure out how I might be able to get it working by myself.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Well, everyone else said they were friendly and helpful, but we found them to be the exact opposite. They came over and spent literally 2 seconds saying “We cant fix it. Get a new one” and left without even saying goodbye.
My husband tried to make it easier for Yost to fix by opening the stove so he could get to it. No one else was fixing it!!!!  I guess they were on a “cant spend more than a second or two” kind of time frame. It was so rude, and usually all the people we’ve dealt with ARE at least polite. Hey people. dont take your bad day out on your customers or you wont have them anymore.
Will NEVER call them again.</text>

I was supposed to get a call back on Monday morning, but didn't get one until Tuesday. However, they fit me in the same day to work around my schedule, were on time, courteous, and fixed my washing machine quickly (luckily they had the part needed). They'll be my first call next time I have a major appliance issue.</Text>

I have had nothing but excellent service from Mr. Yost and his son. They always show up on time, are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, efficient and effective. They have so much experience that they know what the issue as soon as they hear the problem. It is good to work with a local repair service with such excellent skills and reputation. Check them out for your next appliance repair needs.<//review>

<text>Prior to calling Yost I tried to schedule an online appointment with a different company. That company never bothered to call me back, so I called Yost. The woman on the phone was very pleasant and she told me the that the technician, Mr. Yost, would be at my house that same day. She gave me a one-hour window in which to expect his arrival. Mr. Yost arrived right on time and was able to complete the repair within 15 minutes at a reasonable cost. Mr. Yost and his assistant were both courteous. I was so happy to have my dryer fixed! I washed 6 loads of laundry that same day and everything was working great. Thanks, Yost Appliance!< /text>< Pictures>

This was the 3rd time I've used their service. The 1st time I called called them was because I could not get a satisfactory time for another company to arrive and service my washer. I called them in the morning and they were at my house that afternoon. Every time I have had an issue with my washer or dryer since then, I call them. They always provide same day service. They are very polite and do excellent work. I highly recommend them!< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>It was after reading these reviews that I decided to contact Yost Appliance when our 1.5 year old dishwasher flooded out the kitchen for the sixth or seventh time. At 11:35 Saturday night I sent an email via the "Contact Us" box on their website.  I received an automatic confirmation message followed in a matter of minutes by an email from Burt Yost saying that he would call me on Monday morning at 7:30.  Early Monday morning he called and set up a time to meet me that afternoon.  He was waiting when I arrived home.  I greatly appreciated that he was able to quickly diagnose and correct the problem on  the dishwasher.  In less than 30 minutes I was on my way back to work.  Burt was friendly, professional and extremely helpful... even nicely suggested that I might want to read the operating manual to answer some of my questions regarding the dishwasher's features.  I read it last night and learned all sorts of interesting and helpful information!  We rarely have appliance problems, but when we do, we will be sure to call Yost!  Thank you Burt!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1522438242354, 'text': 'Thank you so much Ann for taking the time to write this detailed review of our services.

We recently had Yost come to our new home to look at a washer and dryer that were giving us trouble.  They were honest and forthright.  Instead of trying to up sell or over sell us they laid out our options for repair or replacement.

Update 6/6/18: Mr. Yost called me yesterday after reading this review to apologize for missing the appointment and to do what he could to make things right. I appreciate that he really does care about his customers and that he does want to provide them with the best service possible.
_____________
Won't be using them again. I went with Yost this time because of all the positive reviews on Google, so I was fairly surprised all of the hassle involved in getting an appointment and getting my fridge ice maker replaced. The first couple times I called, I got their answering machine and left a message. Finally got a hold of the receptionist and gave her my fridge model number to confirm they could do the repairs. She said they do work on that model, but for some reason I had to speak with Mr. Yost before I could actually schedule the appointment. She said he'd call me before the end of the day, but he didn't call that day or the next. I called back the following day and had to give all the information to the receptionist again. Fortunately Mr. Yost was there, but I had to give all the same information to him as well. It's like the receptionist and Mr. Yost weren't communicating.
Finally was able to schedule an appointment and two guys came over to look at my ice maker. Spent less than 5 minutes looking at it, saw that it was bad, and said it needed replacing. They checked their shop, didn't have the part in stock, said they had to order the part, and that they would come by at the same time 2 days later to install it. Great! I was glad it was being taken care of so quickly. Well 2 days later, I'm at my house waiting for them and they missed the appointment. I called their office, but no one picks up. I call Mr. Yost's cell phone and he says he doesn't have the appointment on his schedule. I call the office again and the receptionist said the part isn't in and that they won't be able to install it until the following week. WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THEY LET ME KNOW THEY WOULDN'T BE SHOWING UP TO THE APPOINTMENT!
The same guys show up the following week and spent about 20 minutes removing the old part and installing the new one. Technical Charges were $145, which seems like a lot to me. I know they're specialists, but, in total, the repair guys were probably in my house for less than 30 minutes, and I doubt that looking up the part number and placing the order takes a ton of time or effort. So approximately $290 per hour? I was hoping they would at least have given me some sort of discount for not showing up to an appointment. New ice maker seems to be working fine though.<//text>

The first week of school, we realized our refrigerator had stopped running at some point, so we transferred all of our salvageable food to ice boxes. When 8:00 a.m. finally arrived, we called Yost Appliance and they were there within a half an hour! They had a new motor installed shortly thereafter. They were courteous, knowledgeable and super responsive. I had expected a long wait, hassle and hefty bill, but none of that ensued. This is the kind of service you need at times of appliance break down.</Text>

Burt Yost and his son fixed my Samsung dryer today and did an outstanding job.  They arrived promptly and quickly determined what was needed to fix my machine. They were very courteous and professional throughout the process.  Plus the bill was reasonable.

<review>Yost Appliance, Inc. is the oldest service company in Santa Barbara since 1969.  Burt is the best Santa Barbara appliance repair man and the other repair men are also professionally trained. They have several different appliance repair services, like refrigerator repairs, dishwasher repairs, washer and dryer repairs, etc.  Yost Appliance also handles many large brands such as, Maytag, Kitchenaide, Magic Chef, etc. The team is very good at what they do, their prices are fair and reasonable, and they are honest and ethical—which is very important because many appliance repair companies will sometimes charge a little too much.

As one of SB's oldest appliance repair shops, Yost Appliance, has been doing it right for many years.  They are informative, service most all makes and models and are most importantly honest.  As a landlord who lives out of town I find Yost easy to use for both myself and my tenant.<//review>

<review>Our dryer had a problem just days before Christmas.  Never a good time to get a repair done!  We called Yost and they happily made an appt. for Dec. 23. They arrived within the hour time frame they had given me and quickly diagnosed the problem.  However, it was probably going to mean ordering a part.  They assured me that they would get back to me as soon as they had the part - but during the holidays, I figured we were looking at sometime next week.

Surprisingly, we got a call the very next day.... Christmas Eve Day!!  They had the part and could be to our house in 20 minutes!  Wow!  ... but that's not all....

After arriving at the house they discovered a second, related problem that would keep them from finishing the job without another part.   But after a  quick call to their shop, they assured me they had that part in stock and would run and get it and have the dryer working in no time!  ... Which they did!

Customer service is a lost art!  Yost delivered it big time... and right at the peak of the holiday rush. We are very appreciative of their time, their friendliness and good nature.  Mr. Yost and his son were so helpful - and we wish them a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!< /review>< pics>

< Review>
I called Yost Appliance because of a broken clothes dryer...they were extremely courteous and helpful...Mrs. Yost immediately dispatched Mr. Yost to our rescue...within 45 minutes...Mr. Yost diagnosed the problem without theatrics and happily had the part on his truck...he keeps a large inventory of parts...within a half hour, the problem was fixed...no fuss, no muss...and the price was reasonable given the prompt and efficient service...these people are the best, old school in the sense that they are reliable, pleasant and knowledgeable....#1 for appliance repair in Santa Barbara

The best Santa Barbara Appliance Repair Company!  They are also the oldest in town...since 1969 I think.   I would highly recommend Burt Yost for dishwasher repair, oven repair, freezer repair, refrigerator repair, washer repair, dryer repair and garbage disposal repair and more. Here is a copy and paste from their web site...Yost Appliance Inc. has been a premier source of repair services for household appliances in the Santa Barbara area since 1969. They provide same day service to residents of Goleta, Carpintera, and neighboring regions of Santa Barbara, and can repair almost every brand and model of appliance in the industry. Their technicians are well known for their attention to detail, and their dedication to guaranteeing your satisfaction.</Review>

<text>The Yosts were prompt, pleasant and professional and I would highly recommend them for appliance repair need.  How many times has someone had to wait in a window between four and eight hours to even get a repairman out to their home?  With the Yosts, you don't.  They got the job done very fast and of course, correctly.  I really appreciated it. Anyone in the Santa Barbara area should call them if the need arises.</text>< Name>

I needed a repair on a dishwasher.  Yost Appliance came out and assest the situation that same day.  After running many different tests his recommendation was to replace the unit rather spend a lot of money on costly repairs.  He also looked at the water supply line to the refrigerator and saw that it was improperly installed.  All this for a service call fee.  Excellent customer service!!<//review>

Great experience with the Yost's, senior and junior and so nice to work with a local business.  They were knowledgable and courteous as they assessed the refrigerator.  After a bit of research and work the refrigerator was working in no time.

Mr. Yost and son came to repair my dishwasher - which they did - and at the same time repaired my 57 year old Merrill cooktop.  They also take care of the appliances at my Mom's in Montecito.  I recommend them highly.</Review>

I have stuck by this restaurant through 4 owners! Quality has always gone up and for 29 years now STILL IS HOME OF THE BEST SUPER BURRITO (&chip salsa)IN CALIFORNIA trust me because there isn’t a super burrito I HAVE NOT TRIED! No other compares! It slightly varies with time and prep BUT ALWAYS GOOD TO THE LAST BITE! The couple who owns this place and their family members and workers are super nice!
But today I am IMPRESSED BEYOND WORDS!!  I switched it up today and got breakfast burritos for my kids and I, at my sons request I went to “Mendez” I still call it but it’s PLAYITA MARISCOS! I SHAMEFULLY ADMIT THAT I have been scouting for the best CHORIZO burrito and REGRET NOT STARTING HERE I’ve wasted time and money because hands down this was the MOST AMAZING BURRITO I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE! EVEN MY TWO BOYS LOVES IT! My kids do NOT EVER EAT ALL of THEIR FOOD they devoured theirs without making a peep!! I HAD TO CALL BACK IN TO ADD AN EXTRA TIP!!! I strongly recommend the super burrito with  Chorizo egg beans rice and a little sour cream It was PERFECT!!!< /review>

I was here a week ago and forgot to share photos and a review. I came here because a friend works nearby and wanted to grab a couple tacos for the evening. I’ve thought about coming here myself several times before, but it is always jam packed. I ordered the carne asada and chicken tacos. Both were delicious. A word of caution, the complimentary habanero sauce they provide once you’re seated is very spicy. Warn us the waitress did. Great sauce, but a tad bit too spicy for my palate. Conveniently located, spacious parking, great friendly service.</Review>

I came in to get a nice meal but ended up leaving with missing personal items, the service was very poor and very unprofessional. I left to go use the restroom and came back and my items were missing from the table.... very unsatisfied with the service and honesty of this restaurant< /Text>

I don't really give out 1 star however this place deserved it. Tried to call in an order however no one picked up the phone so I drove down.
Arrived and many of the waitresses and waiters gave me eye contact however no greeting or letting mw know someone will be with me. I waited at the register to order my Togo order and for 5 minutes the waitresses ans waiters ignored me while they processed the diners paid orders. One last finally acknowledged me and asked what I would like to order .. Placed my order then was told I needed to show my id or my order wouldn't be placed. So I walked to my car grabbed my I'd and brought it in to show her my card did belong to me. I did think back at the transactions that I seen in front of me where people paid with cards however I didnt see ids .With the card so I think I was indeed singled out. Ive never been asked for my id at restaurants so I did ask if every one has to show ID and she replied yes. Didn't buy it!

I ordered the shrimp and octopus cocktail and I let you know later if it was worth the $18.47 I spent.<//text>

On 09/16 we went and placed an order to go. As i'm trying to pay the lady said she can not use my card because its' too heavy and crashes their system. (Chase saphire) that makes absolute non sense it is a visa card same as any other debit or credit card. So I had to go outside and use another card. She hands us our order we order two shrimp cocktails.Our order had  no spoons, no napkins, no ketchup, no hotsauce, no lemon. I asked can we get some ketchup and lemon. She gives me one piece of lemon. I asked her can you give me another one. She was like no, one piece of lemon per order. But Iordered two cocktails.?!! I could not stand her attitude and i just walked away. When we get to our picnic we noticed that she only gave  two little packs of ketchup!!  No hotsauce and one spoon. Beyond petty, worst service and attitude ever.</text>

My guachinango was not fresh and it was over fried. The rest of the meal was good even if I had to pay extra for home made tortillas. The waitres was super de-duper fast but she was to busy all the time. They expected you to eat and leave. I was going to sit and chill with my daughter and have a few beers But it wasn't privet enough. There was a couple and two small families waiting in line to get called in to sit and eat. The waitress was So busy running around to other things she didn't check if we needed anything and forgot to give up silverware. Then I was wanting another beer before the food came and I couldn't flag her down to come over. So I we ate as soon as we could and left. Over all they have a great variety of seafood and it's fresh & quick from order to table. The only other thing I was disappointed with was that they only have one bathroom for all genders and big furniture for such a tiny place.<//text>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) If I could give them a lower rating, unfortunately 1 star is required to share the experience, the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant, you will be too loud and with a very negative attitude, in our case, to mention that one of the dishes that we asked for we didn't like (this after only giving it a small spoonful), that was more than enough so that 2 months would come to allege and in a very unprofessional way to make sure that we would also be charged for it, (which they ended up to do), the truth is that this kind of attitude is not what is expected of any restaurant, a real shame.

(Original)
Si pudiera les daría menor calificación, lamentablemente 1 estrella es requerida para compartir la experiencia, el peor servicio que haya jamás experimentado en un restaurante, las me serás demasiado altaneras y con actitud muy negativa, en nuestro caso, al mencionarseles que uno de los platos que pedimos no nos había gustado ( esto después de  únicamente darle una pequeña cucharada), eso fue más que suficiente para que 2meseras se acercarán a alegar y de manera muy poco profesional asegurarnos que de igual manera se nos cobraría por el, ( cosa que acabaron por hacer), la verdad que esa clase de actitud no es lo que se espera de ningún restaurante, una verdadera lástima.</Text>

The food is in a word, EXCELLENT and very varied. The habanero sauce is something out of the ordinary is incredibly delicious.
The bad:
The place is very small.
When there are a lot of people the waiters come every two and a half minutes to ask if everything is fine. That's when you should chew a lot faster or swallow food so they can be quiet. Micheladas have excess Tajin.

Lo bueno:
La comida es en una palabra, EXCELENTE y muy variada. La salsa de habanero es algo fuera de serie está increíblemente deliciosa.
Lo malo:
El lugar es muy pequeño.
Cuando hay mucha gente empiezan a venir los meseros cada dos minutos y medio a preguntarte si todo está bien. Ahí es cuando debes masticar mucho más rápido o tragar la comida para que puedan estar tranquilos ellos. Las micheladas tienen exceso de Tajin.< /Review>< pics>

Only there is a waitress who has already been there twice that I go with my husband
And it's too high
All food always gives him all drinks
I feel like he has to be a little more professional and address both of them, not just him.
But the food is delicious
And it has only been a waitress with whom I have these types of incidents

La comida está rica me encanta el lugar
Solo que hay una mesera que ya van dos veces que voy con mi esposo
Y es demasiada volada
Toda la comida siempre se la da a el todas las bebidas

Pero la comida está riquisima

(Translated by Google) A bad experience, we were waiting for 10 minutes at the door, nobody came to tell us anything, we went in when the waitress came to tell us that we had to leave so that they would clean up and she started arguing with us, I told her that she didn't have to argue with the customers and she followed him We chose to withdraw that poorly attended by Hispanic people, the truth is that this place is not recommended and hopefully and they fire those employees who do not know what it is to be a waiter

(Original)
Una mala experiencia estuvimos 10 minutos esperando en la puerta nadie llego decirnos nada nos entramos cuando llego la mesera a decirnos que nos teniamos que salir para que limpiarán y se puso a discutir con nosotros le dije que no tenia porque discutir con los clientes y le siguio optamos por retirarnos que mal atendido por personas hispanas la verdad no se recomienda ese lugar y ojala y despudan a esas empleadas que no saben lo que es ser mesero< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) When you arrive at the place there is no person responsible for giving you a table, there was a woman with an angry face that she could not hide, I think it would be better if they got someone more attentive and above all intelligent. I think it will be the last time I will attend this place.

(Original)
Cuando llegas al lugar no hay una persona responsable de darte mesa, estaba una mujer con cara de enojada que no podía disimular, creo que sería mejor que consiguieran a otra persona más atenta y sobre todo inteligente. Creo que será la última vez que asistire a este lugar.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

(Translated by Google) Not a star deserves this restaurant for a plate of 5 breaded shrimp cut in half to make see more! With a hint of rice and two leaves of lettuce with a slice of cucumber ... you boldly charge $ 15 a steal from the eye. And the manager is shielding; That was a takeaway dish and that no way. I don't buy again

(Original)
Ni una estrella se merece este restaurant por un plato de 5 camarones empanisados cortados por mitad para hecer ver más! Con una pisca de arroz y dos hojas de lechuga con una rebanada de pepino... que atrevidos cobras $15 un robo a ojos vistos.  Y el manager se escudo  disiendo; que era plato para llevar y Que ni modo. No vuelvo a comprar hay<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) They lack seasoning in Broths and Sauces go from one extreme to the other! Sometimes they take time to assist you without having many people, very good variety of ice cold beers! But it hurts that they have limits!

(Translated by Google) The seasoning is good, the bad thing is that the stuffed pineapples are very expensive and they serve it very little

Union Valley is one of my favorite lakes to swim in Eldorado Forest. Has nice sandy beaches and the best part it's free. Tons of camp spots but they fill up quick.Got here on a Thursday night and there was only 4 sites open in September!<//text>

<review>Really nice campsites. Best time to go there is beginning of the summer when the lake is still full,  not too hot. My family had a really good time camping here, beautiful scenery right next to the water, most of the campsites here are next to the water. The only thing you must bring when coming to Camp here is water there is no water at the campsites.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjDr2mzzwD-neXhI9mXIdTMK_wwMARryJevbIT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvlcE6VUaEPlEABvcvwkaNqXn1hXaFOEgXcqpa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpZXV0me9JQuLaq_MBW0c0FmOtzqfeo1_g2S4l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPex1fwaGmo4ZwlJ84eaMkhyMqnLx-Vwf68X_53=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2ilhElB_kORc3J421RCruGEwWTtAV3_kcxyVC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkHzZu-RmC2xMTMcGa8ufXZv6brZe5Vym3_By2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

Since it is free you get some of the "free people" that have no regard for others around them-loud music, rude and want to fight. These are the weekend people.  Come in Monday or Sunday night and head out Friday.  Some folks there were wonderful people,  it only takes one group.  One thing there is cell service and the Sheriff's department responds fast for being in the boonies. Again this is a beautiful area, nice camp sites but avoid the weekend.  Also, the last mile is a dirt road that is passable, we took our 25ft trailer in and saw a couple that were larger.  The lower section is very tight, so becareful with larger rigs. Ours was a tight squeeze, but upper section was fine.< /review><Name>Matti Smith< /Name>< rate>

Really great place to go camping only downside is on the weekends it gets really loud with a bunch of drunk idiots. So I recommend bringing earplugs. Other than that it's great place to camp with friends and family.</text>

I decided to go to Best Cell Phone Repair because of the great reviews and I am truly glad I made that decision. Luis is an honest professional who is both passionate about his work and cares about the people who walk through his door. He offered me a great price and in less than 30 minutes he fixed my phone and I was on my way. He even gave me a free screen protector because I didn’t have one on my iPhone.

His friendly demeanor, prompt service, and affordable prices are the reasons this is now my go-to place if I’m ever in need of any future services.

Thank you again, Luis— you’re the best!<//text>

<text>Strong 5 STARS! I wasn’t sure what to expect when I went looking for someone to repair my iPhone. I had bad luck getting a screen replaced at a kiosk in the mall and that was just terrible.

So I called a few people and these guys were really professional and I’m actually riding with this review on the phone they fix for me. I highly recommend them!

Saved me 110 dollars on what I thought needed to be repaired but they were able to clean it and get my iPhone working ! Also did my screen replacement quickly and skillfully in quick amount of time. Luis was extremely knowledgable and honest, I would recommend this store to anyone looking to get an affordable repair !</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I had called before I actually went in & the gentleman by the name Luis was VERY polite and well spoken he told me before he gave me a quote on my phone to bring it in. Upon bringing my phone in he took a quick look which didn’t take more than 15 minutes and gave me a detailed description of what I had to do to repair it, he saw I was in a bit of a rush and wanting my phone fixed so he did what he could for me and then sent me on my way to one of his associates who could get me what I needed the very same day, if anything else should happen to my phone I wouldn’t hesitate to go right back to this business….10/10!!

Live up to their name !!
So I'm the type of person who's constantly dropping my phone and I always put it off repairing it because I don't want to pay $120 or $100 MINIMUM and just last night my screen cracked to the point that i could not open my messages or even put in my passcode because the screen wasn't responding. Me and my boyfriend looked and called various repair shops and no one would answer or the one that did answer said repair would cost $110 that being too much for a screen replacement we continued to look and found this little hidden jewel. The service was great, super friendly gentlemen, very reasonable price and the best part it was done within 30-40 minutes so I was able to get it fixed before I had to go in to work. Highly recommend, no longer need to drive up to LA or pay over priced repair shops when I can go and pay $75 in a shop that's in the same city. Thank you so much my phone was left like new and the color is much better now than it was from a previous repair. Thank you thank you highly recommend thank you guys so much! Keep up the good work!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

He fixed my iPhone XR for a very reasonable price and was super friendly! The work was done quick and had me in and out of his business in 30 minutes. I would recommend this iPhone repair place and will be returning if I need any additional help!<//review>

My wife broke the screen on her iPhone Xs on Sunday and I called around to get a quote. Ended up going here and was very impressed. Luis (the owner I think) replaced the screen and digitizer in about 30 minutes and explained what he was doing throughout the process. His work (and the screen) comes with a 2-month warranty and everything worked like new!<//Text>

<Review>When we walked in, the building was nice and cool, outside was hot (it also smelled very good inside). We were instantly greeted by 2 very kind ladies and instantly they both worked together to help us with what we were looking for and to see what was in stock.  Such kind, outgoing, professional yet personal ladies! One lady kept our kids entertained while the adults checked out. Such an easy check out, I am still shocked at how fast and non-problematic it was! We were able to take 2 beds home (the kids are SO excited!) and we will get the rest of our order next week.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

The customer service was so amazing! John helped us so much. We almost weren't able to get a bed because our credit check but they have many financing options available. We got the bed we wanted at a great price. Can't wait until they deliver it tomorrow! Thank you so much< /Text>

Rick was pleasant and knew his mattresses. He allowed us the opportunity to try out different types.
He is a great conversationalist and made us feel comfy.  Our purchase was easy and no pressure at all. He explained everything and offered a few extras we choose not to take.

Thankful we stopped there.</text>

This is our forth bed we have bought from mattress firm.
Rich one of the managers always treat me with respect and professionalism every time I have visited .
You would be wise to have him train so if your other employees on how to treat loyal customers.

He knows his products well, very friendly, patiently answered every question, listened to my needs.  Then matched me up with the perfect mattress and pillow.  The best part is that it is being delivered tomorrow,  completely installed.  I love that I got to support a local business!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Time>

We went to a few stores before Mattress Firm & at each place we were greeted and pointed in the general direction of mattresses. Here, she greeted us and helped us figure out which mattress type we liked best while giving us a lot of good information on each type!

She was super patient and we never felt pushed or rushed even though she was the only person working and had other customers she took care of with such a grace!

Ultimately we found a mattress that we loved and worked with our budget! We will definitely return for all our mattress needs because of AUDREY !< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>We went into mattress firm over by the home depot in Redding. We worked with Chris who was very knowledgeable and friendly. We liked him so much that we didnt care if we had to pay a little extra for our mattress just because of how good his customer service was. I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking out a new bed.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Went to the mattress firm clearance store and had an amazing experience. Our person who helped us is Jonathan and was very informative and helped us find the right mattress for us. He was very easy going with no pressure to buy. Jonathan showed us many types of mattresses and we were able to walk out same day with our new mattress. Ive been to this store a few times and had a great experience each time im here. I would recommend it to everyone in the market for an excellent mattress with a great price.< /review>

<review>The store appeared clean, the sales staff were knowledgeable and friendly. We bought a demo mattress that was a crazy good deal. Picked up the same day from their warehouse and slept on it that night. Overall no issues, Audrey did a good job listening to what we wanted and found a few choices for us.</review>< Time>

<Review>My boyfriend and I were out bed shopping and wanted a memory foam bed. Our last stop of the evening was here at Mattress Firm. It was definitely a great choice. Jonathan Thompson was working and took very good care of us. His knowledge of mattresses won us over. He was very kind, friendly, and made our decision making very easygoing. A big shout out to Mattress Firm and Jonathan for helping my boyfriend and I get a better nights sleep.<//Review>< pics>

Jonathan Thompson was an excellent and knowledgeable representative of the company. He found out what we needed and expected in a bed to help narrow our choices and then patiently helped us without any pressure. He then arranged delivery and kept us up to date when weather forced changes. We highly recommend  Jonathan and the Mattress Firm when shopping for a mattress.< /Review>

<Review>We went to the store to start a search for a new mattress.  Rich Sieck greeted us and made us feel comfortable.  He listened to our desires and perceived needs and showed us several options.  After going home and discussing what we had seen, we ended up deciding that we could not do better and bought a mattress.  Rich made it easy.  He matched the price quoted on their website and sent us a link so we could pay online.  The mattress came when promised and the delivery mechanism couldn't have been  more prompt and professional and the delivery people were great.  Just an excellent experience.< /Review>< Pictures>

Lucius was so helpful and friendly! He went above and beyond to make sure we were getting exactly what we wanted.

I came here for Black Friday deals. I was greeted by John who is a very friendly man and a good salesman. I told him exactly what I wanted, he showed me it, asked a couple of questions, asked me about appropriate additions to the sale and then I got the bed I needed. It was very painless, I wasn’t in there long, and I feel that I was treated properly as a customer and a fellow citizen of Redding. Thank you John, and thank you Mattress Form Clearance for the easy and pleasant experience.</Review>

We found EXACTLY what we needed today...no hassle at all. The young lady (Audrey Dukes) that helped us was very knowledgable and I'm quite sure we got the best price possible...thanks, Audrey!< /text>

The store was clean, warm and inviting; and the staff was friendly. Jonathan was a pleasure to work with while shopping for a new mattress for our children. He's very knowledgeable, didn't pressure us at all, was very patient as we had many questions, and he helped us find the perfect fit. We're very pleased with our experience and highly recommend working with Jon! - Brandon<//Text>

I have purchased numerous mattresses and frames from this store and have loved the prices and quality of every single one. During the Carr fire we needed a new bed for guests that were evacuating. We came into the store and Josh had actually made it in to work. He was nice enough to close one store and take us to the other to get the bed we wanted! Today John helped us find and purchase a new bed for my Mom. Excellent customer service and prices!</Text>

<Text>My family just moved from VA and CA so we needed some new mattresses.  We had heard great things about sleep train so we decided to give them a try.

The service and attention we received were excellent!  I didn't feel rushed and all of my questions were thoroughly and thoughtfully answered.  Buying a mattress is a big deal since so many hours are logged on it, and comfortable sleep is so important!

I took my time, had all our kids try out their mattresses, and we would go back and forth.  Our sales rep was patient, understanding, and made sure that we picked the best mattress for our situation, not just the most expensive mattress!

I highly recommend them!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>When we purchased the bed we were just looking for a good nights sleep without the morning pain of getting up. I can only say this bed has more than exceeded our expectations. We both sleep so much better and for myself I am not getting up as much during the night to stretch my legs and back and get my circulation moving. As a matter of face I slept a full 8 hours last night without getting up once. I never thought that I would love a bed this much.</Review><rating>5</rating>< pics>

got a bed from this company in the bay-area and went in here for warranty problem and because the mattress cover was not put on our bill because it was given to us as a gift for buying all we did and the cover is always on the bed but did not protect the bed as stated the said sorry your warranty is no good it would be if the bill showed the mattress cover on it will never use this company again and tell our friends don't go there<//review>

The man who helped me is the most gracious and positively vibed person I have come across in a long time. I'm sorry I didn't get his name. I was getting an ASMR effect as he carefully wrapped my items, but not before he cleared then with sage!  A million thumbs up!

<Time>1614823070203< /Time><Text>I literally just went today: so in total I think the shop is great! It has a cozy feel to it, the items there are in great quality, and the staff is very nice as well! They have other stuff like Tarot Cards, Pendulums, Books, etc. I also really like how they also offer to sage crystals before giving them, which is very nice! (This is coming from a witch) so overall its a great shop! Would shop there again.< /Text><gmapID>0x808f7e1c9bdf9213:0x61ae527eb9ce0b8c</gmapID>< rating>

<text>This place was very welcoming and smelled relaxing. We had to sanitize our hands before coming in and wear a mask. The people in the store were very nice, the store was clean, they have candles, big and little crystals, oils, the stones and crystals were very organized. We had a great visit.<//text>< UserId.>

Although crystals are beautiful, I never believed they had magical powers. My corporate housing needed some good vibes stat! After flowers, plants and smudging did not cleanse the energy, I was ready to try anything. The staff patiently helped me pick the right crystal and I walked away with a huge slab of selenite. Within a couple of days, I felt more at home. Not sure if it is mind over matter but I may be back for some reiki.</Text>

<Text>This place is absolutely amazing. Beautiful stones, wonderful selection, very knowledgeable and kind staff. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner, who was such a sweet and generous woman. I never once felt like I was being sold an item, but instead felt like I was being assisted in finding what it was that would bring me the most joy (even if it meant being talked into purchasing something of lesser monetary value). 4 stars for sure! Will be back.<//Text>< Pictures>

The first day we visited SF, we went to the market store and we liked it very much, both the selection of stones and crystals, as well as its quality, I was in love with a beautiful $ 300 sphere and I spent the whole week of my holidays thinking about it. When we returned to visit the store before returning to Spain, my partner wanted to give me the sphere, and we were ready to buy it, but the clerk spoke with another employee of us thinking that we would not understand it and he said that he did not give us a discount, because We were going to buy nothing because we had already been seeing the whole store a few days ago. I thought it was rude and very inaccurate in its prediction because our purchase was going to exceed 400 $, since I am a lover of crystals and it was very special for me to acquire a piece that reminded me of this trip. This whole unpleasant episode happened on Tuesday, March 27, around 4:30 p.m. Dear shop assistant, do not be so badly educated and do not judge by appearances. Thanks to you I will not recommend this place.</Review>

I'm always so busy looking at men walking by that I never noticed this shop, but recently went in with my cousin and I fell in LOVE with it! The Crystals are absolutely beautiful and I love all of the stones and the jewelry and I found some very interesting pieces. I also noticed candles, tarot cards, books, and other Mystical/Psychic sort of items in this shop. There are also books. I am currently working with a Psychic in El. Cerrito in the East Bay but I would love to bring her in. I believe this shop is very well known  and has been around for ages. I feel that this shop is credible and authentic, and flowing with good karma and energy. I believe that Crystal Way also offers an outlet to other services in the psychic realm. Anyway, I have had a very positive experience here and the staff are quite knowledgeable. Crystal Way feels like a flowing stream of power!< /text>

Time and time again, I really enjoy visiting this peaceful and friendly store.  You can find every stone and customer service has always felt genuine. Recently visited the store to find a particular energy stone and found it. Sage is sold there, rings and books.  They offer Tarot readings!<//Text>

< Review>
They have great wine selection and their food is absolutely delicious. Everything is fresh and perfect. 9/10 times you get a great waiter too, but 4 you get one who is not really concerned with the guest experience. I think it may have been because I was there with my partner and two kids. He seemed somewhat anti-kid. My kiddos are total foodies and were looking forward to a 1st class experience and it was a bit disappointing.< /Review>

<text>Limited seating since it’s only outside, but sounded like they’re moving to a different location closer to more foot traffic so maybe they’ll have more tables. Food was decent but seems like a limited staff at this time. That said the flavors were on point with all our dishes.< /text><user_name>Luis Turrubiartes< /user_name>< Resp>

Excellent meal at this cozy neighborhood favorite. My husband and I shared an appetizer of grilled calamari with white beans and arugula. Very fresh tasting and the lemony dressing was perfect. We shared the delectable Sardinian pasta with various shellfish  for the second course, followed by the melt-in-your mouth braised beef short ribs. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the wines. We left it in his capable hands to pair a wine by the glass for each course.  We love to try new restaurants but both agreed we need to dine at this local standout more often!<//review>

My family had a terrific experience ordering delivery. All the instructions were followed correctly and the food was great. It was also great how they provided sides of freshly grated parmesan cheese for each entre. The bread was also excellent, normally I find bread from Italian restaurants is pretty forgettable but that was not the case here. I also enjoyed their unusual variations dishes that I haven't seen in other Italian restaurants. I will definitely be back.<//text>

We ate there early in the evening and challenged the kid friendly reputation with our two year old twin grandsons. The kids split the braised short ribs and the gnocchi.  They loved it.  Two people had the pork chop and it was big wonderful and perfectly cooked. I had the calamari app and it was also fabulous and flavorful.

The service was warm, friendly and skilled.  It was a lovely dinner.  A great place to have so near where our daughter lives.  Thanks for a very nice meal.< /text>

We’ve been going to Bacco for years. The food is consistently delicious, especially the rigatoni. The risotto is the best in town. The owner and staff work hard and deliver excellent service. We’ve brought many friends here and they’ve all loved it. It’s truly a great neighborhood restaurant.<//Review>

Lamb shank, Rigatoni, and most likely everything on the menu that we tried were fabulous.< /Review>

Having spent some time in Italy myself (and having to eat out for every meal), I confidently found that the authenticity was unquestionable and very delicious. Another comment here mentioned octopus, which I had as an appetizer. If there was something I had to recommend in particular from my meal, this would surely be it.

I was also very pleased by the service. This was personally the second time I've been here — first time being when I was probably in diapers when it just opened...so I was pretty much a new customer again. It was evident that there are returning customers, yet my table was given the same friendly and dedicated service as everyone else. We had constant communication and acknowledgement from the waiter and passing staff. The food tasted and was prepared in an upscale fashion, but the service was family-esque. Very complete restaurant, plan to go back.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Incredibly underwhelmed with this experience. I ordered take out over the phone and was quoted 20 minutes. I got there on time, was greeted after standing for a couple minutes. They asked me what name the order was under but I hadn't been asked for a name. The server disappeared for a moment, walked back out and didn't say anything to me. After another 5 minutes, a woman came out, said it would be a moment and then left. Another 10 minutes later and I finally got rung up, and the food was out in another 5. Total of 20 minutes of waiting. The woman I placed the order with most certainly forgot to put it in to the kitchen and didn't just explain the mistake and apologize. It was not busy enough for a 40 minute wait time to feel justified. There was little communication about my order and it overall felt pretentious and like I was not worth their time. The food was mediocre at best, I ordered the Ravioli and at the price of $21, I feel like I could have made better at home. The side of bread I was given was stale. Who the hell serves stale bread? According to the other reviews, the bread usually comes with a pesto dipping sauce for it. Never got any. I should have just taken the drive and gone to Spiazzo Ristorante in West Portal. Won't be coming back here again.<//review>< pictures>

We ate at Bacco again tonight, and the waiter could tell we wanted a quick dinner.  We were in and out in 35 minutes with a great meal.  Rigatoni, Gnocchi, Ravoli dishes have all been very good on various visits.  And the olive oil they provide with the bread is an excellent (and free!) starter.  The food and service isn't quite 5 star, but it's close.

<text>The food was good - we had appetizers of eggplant mousse, grilled calamari, salumi, and 5 onion soup, and pans cotta - and it was expensive.   Two people, no wine and it was almost $75 before tip. The room is really nice and airy with calm lighting. The service is excellent. It's a step up from most of the neighborhood places in Noe Valley.</text><rate>4</rate></record></dataset><record>

Nicely decorated, good food but a little put off with slightly cold reception when my party first arrived.  Felt host was more concerned with Caucasian patrons than us (minority).  Waiter was a little abrupt when we tried to give him a count of how many cups of coffee we wanted, he preferred to count for himself.  The thing is, the whole restaurant experience also includes the type of service you get from the employee/owner. It's always nice when the host greets you warmly. So these comments have nothing to do with the food. The three stars reflex the attitudes of the employees.  For $76 a person serving 6 people, they should be nicer.< /Review>

<Review>You can't beat the combination of food, service, atmosphere, neighborhood, ...and did I say food?  If you don't get the Sacchetto, or Brasato, or Rigatoni, you're really missing out. Oh, and the risotto and fish specials are usually fantastic.  Great Italian wine list too.  Obviously, I love this place.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Disappointed! One lovely server covering 2/3rds of the restaurant by herself meant painfully slow service. Food was bland and oily. Dunno what the fuss was all about here. So many call this place a Now Valley institution, I call it average at best.< /Text>

An out-of-the-way gem!  Tables far enough apart that you don't feel like you're at a baseball game.  Unusual menu items such as octopus (luscious!) and baccala (as good as the maitre d's grandmother used to make it).  An array of pasta dishes to suit a wide range of tastes.  Recommend the panna cotta and apple pastry dessert (similar to tarte tatin).  Modest-sized portions.  Professional, unobtrusive service.  An oasis in the urban bustle.<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Food was tasty and fresh, ordered their fregola pasta. Giving them 3 stars for their service felt rushed. We had to finish our food quickly so they could clear the table. We also felt rushed to order. #LetsGuide #italianfood

I ordered the fregola pasta which was good with fresh ingredients. The service was not good, we had to rush to eat and order. They speak Spanish #hablo

<Review>Our group of 6 was seated quickly.  The food was very tasty and the atmosphere of the restaurant was intimate.   The staff was very nice and for me, having worked in a restaurant before, was very enjoyable for us, as customers. I shall return.   Btw, my house is around 35 miles away.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Great food, unique and exciting. I left happy. Best fettuccine I've ever had, I wish there was more steak considering the menu photo, but I suppose it's fair considering the price.< /Review>

Delicious with a great selection and good quality. 4/5 on the authentic but 5/5 on the innovative dishes. A bit on the pricy side but worth it. Dishes are large enough to share but you won’t want to. Also really good for daily lunch specials which come with a delicious soup!< /text>

<review>Great place! Amazing food. It was our first time trying food at this place, while we were also celebrating my birthday. All staff are very attentive. Our server Christian was super kind with great food recommendations; he kept checking in to see if we were doing okay. Definitely a restaurant we'll be coming back to.<//review>< Pics>

Peruvian food that's full of flavor & I had the curry-like chicken & potatoes. Delish seafood soup that's so tasty.  Nice alfresco dining & pleasant waitstaff.<//text>

We asked for green sauce twice but never got the ketchup. Christian there was very efficient he brought the green sauce but kids never got the ketchup. Seems like prices went up and taste is not as good as before. 😔 Sad bc it was one of our favorite restaurants.</Text>

The moment you take your first bite you travel to Peru. The wonderful taste on every bite makes your taste buds feel like they just found out they are alive. The drinks will make you want to stay for more.< /Text>

Service was great and food was full of flavor. I was seated right away and had my drink within 5 minutes of seating down. The food was served quickly and  fresh. I love to try new places like this when I travel for work. I plan to bring my wife here for a date night and I have told my coworkers about this place.</Review>

My wife and I ordered two plates as images showed below. The rice and chicken were tasty. However, the beef was over cool and some are charred. I asked the Waiter , "the beef was a little hard to chew, may be like a rock. is this regular? " He replied nicely, "I did ask you if you would like it to be cooked tender. You said you wanted to try regular." I said "okay, there is no way I would eat that." And he ignored that and said," is everything else OK?" ... About 10 minutes later, I asked for the bill, it was $36. I usually tip 15% to 25%, but today I only tip $1 and felt no regret or shamed. To review, I give 1 star for the white rice and another star for the decorations and sort wait time. I know this feel really subjective, but I don't think I will change my rating.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVRVeXFkkx3YkYZlg_r3cFnD2D1nnjWcL1lRrV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY6OGZTlIW3jtfwBYWaYuu1czPLeRWuRZnLaoQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

Our party had the oxtail fettuccine  while I had the pescado macho (seafood with creamy sauce - pictured. Both were very delicious although oddly enough, in a generic way. But definitely hot the spot!</Review>

<Review>Ordered the pollo and lomo saltado. They were $16 and $19 respectively. Overall great quality, however it gets 4 stars because of how little meat i got with the lomo saltado plate. Left me feeling kinda let down and I don’t think the amount of beef justifies the price. Certainly not as much beef as in the pictures. Good quality, small quantity.<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Good food, we came 15 minutes before the kitchen closed at 9pm but they still offered to serve us because we had a very simple order and already knew what we wanted. We did feel somewhat rushed but it's understandable. I enjoyed it overall, but I've had better at other places but I think it's only because it was almost closing time. I'll try again when it's not so late. But it wasn't bad.<//review>< Response>

Food is great. I recommend the Lomo Saltado. You must try the Jalea which is fried calamari, fish, octopus, yuca, and shrimp; you can ask for half or full Jalea. Another must try is the Seviche; fish octopus, calamari, corn nuts cooked in lemon juice but it has an amazing tangy/spicy flavor.<//text>

I had not been to this particular restaurant in a couple of years. Since my last visit they have remodeled the restaurant. The staff was friendly. My favorite meal here is the Lomo Saltado. I ask for boiled potatoes instead of the fries. If you have never had a Peruvian meal I would highly recommend trying it. There are not a lot of Peruvian restaurants but of all of the ones that I have visited this one has the best Peruvian food!!!< /Text>

If you are new to Peruvian cuisine I recommend that you try Inka Gourmet off the 405 and Hawthorne city of Lawndale it is a buffet with plenty of choices fairly price. El rocotto is more on the upscale pricing it can get very expensive quick. I preferred the way the restaurant looked before the remodel it had more culture now it became Americanized.

This is a great place to come for any gathering or celebration. The food is better than Pollo Inka and the price is right as well.</Review>

My only favorite place, always hard to get a table but when you sit down and order. After eating their food you just want to keep eating their food. The service is sometimes awesome and sometimes they kind of loose it but I believe its because they are always so crowded due to their awesome food and the different people that walk through their doors.< /Text>

<Text>last night my wife and I ordered by phone for a pick up order was  2 Lomos Saltados, at the end of the call my wife tells me ummm so weird,  and asked what happened?  She told me the bill came out of $ 48.00 and I said well maybe she's wrong, when we went to collect the order we realized that in fact they were $ 48.20 !!!  the truth it's if that their prices are very very high!!! we have visited many restaurants with better quality and reasonable prices, the food was very simple without flavor, the meat very dry, well I had my experience and the truth I will not try again.</Text>< name>

< Review>
This was our second visit to this place. Have to admit that first time was much better. Restaurant was downgraded from A to B, flavor of the food and service was much better before as well. The only thing that stay the same are the prices. For this type of food taste and service, it is overpriced. Food looks very good and was presented nicely, so I gave 1 star more than I really wanted to give. Wonder if I was better going to the other side of the Artesia where another Peruvian restaurant sits.<//Review>

<text>DO NOT TRUST THE WAITERS!!! DO REVIEW YOUR CHECKS!!! I was ripped off tonight by waitress Betty. First we had to ask three times for bread and salsas, . Then, she took a long time to tale our orders. She seemed to be in the kitchen for a long time, as opposed to the other waiters were around the dining floor. Ultimately i got charged $150 for a bill that should have been no more than $120 including taxes. Worse part is that the one that realized the over charge was my fiancee after I paid, restaurant is closed, and we were on our way. I've been going to this restaurant since 2002 and never had this issue before. No more, I don't care how good the food is... 🤬🤬🤬<//text>< Gmap_id>

The taste of the food is just ok. In my opinion as a Peruvian I don’t think is that great! Prices are reasonable and the restaurant is located in the strip mall so it does have parking.</review>

Alot more authentic than El Pollo Inka... That's for sure! Everything here is good. Ceviche 🔥. Aji De Gallina (idk if that's the correct dish) 🔥. This place is real popular, even on Sundays. Everytime I go it's busy.<//Review>

<Text>I absolutely love this place! I've been going here with my family ever since I was a kid and I have to say the fresh bread and the two sauces that they bring out for it right when you sit down is splendid.

< Review>
this place has the touch of style provided by tall walls and high ceilings with a great attention to style and they're the core. Very classy use of wood Marvel and Inca the core also with mirrors hanging to make you feel on a bigger space than it actually is. The servers are very attentive and always available. The food is tasty and the portion size are  abundant. the price you're going to pay of course it's a little higher which is understandable as they do take care of standing out from the Rest by being more classy it's more attention to clean the nest and presentation. this last time I was there I had the chupe de camaron. A very tasty soup although I was tripping for something else that I saw somebody else having but didn't have the name. I had the mixed ceviche which is a must whenever you go to a Peruvian restaurant. I've had three other favorite restaurants and this is not up to par with them. But I have to say is good enough.</Review>

I was hoping the food would be close to other Purivan places like , Polo Inca Gardena. The other place was seasoned well an meat was tender. I ask for the white beans like Inca, they had pinto beans instead. Anyway I'll stick with Polo Inca</Review>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>I’ve been coming to this place for years. The food is one of the best I’ve tried. I drive 1 hour just to go eat at El Rocoto in Gardena. The service is always great. A Jalea is a must (if you eat sea food) the ceviche is just awesome! Coming from someone who is very picky with ceviche. The Lomo Saltado is also a must... prices are reasonable and do serve a lot we always get left overs. I did go to the one in Cerritos once but didn’t like it as much the one in Gardena is much much better and Daiso is practically next door so you can go shopping after having a great meal!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><user_id>101530817595723318238<//user_id><username>Mar Hernandez< /username>< date>

Our philosophy always to have a good quality of ingredients and the most important services\nOur email : elrocoto@hotmail.com'}<//Resp>< Review>
Used to be a good restaurant.  We stopped going because the quality kept deteriorating.  The last time we visited the restaurant,  I asked for tacutacu. What I got was a roll of rice with a  few, or less than a few split beans.  When I brought this to the waitress attention,  she told me that that's how the dish is served.  I asked her if she was peruvian,  she told me, no. Then, there's no way for her to know about the dish. I spoke to the manager on duty.  She couldn't respond either. My wife's lomo saltado, was below average, and so it was the tallarin verde. However, the  restaurant is overpriced. I wish I could post the pictures in this post. So long rocoto.</Review>

<Text>I really like this place. This restaurant capture the taste of peruvian food, ceviche, arroz con mariscos, picante de mariscos are really , really good. The chaufa of mariscos however is a bit grease, price and portions are reasonable. Overall I recommend it.</Text>< pictures>

Service was great, our waitress Anita was very nice. Ceviche and lomo saltado were very good. Loved the algarrobina, moose de Lucuma and mil hojas.</review>

This place has my main experience with Peruvian food. I think it's pretty good. A bit overpriced for my taste. I thought it would be more flavorful in taste.<//review>

<text>The food is good and the atmosphere is great but I was a little disappointed they dont make Saltado de pescado. I would definitely go back if I’m the area but I wouldn’t go out of my way to go back (it’s a little from me). Don Felix is still my #1 go to place for Peruvian. This place is still better than Mario’s.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2ca9e36f11c03:0x16cf9d7b3ed562a3</gmap_id><Time>1535341932449< /Time>< Name>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>This was the second time eating here. Service fast and friendly, but flavor needs some major work. I usually order the saltado de camaron and it wasnt close to other peeuvian restaurants I have been to. My husband 's plate was a big dissapointment. He ordered chicken chaomin, but the chicken taste weird and did not look like chicken breast. We are not coming back to this place again.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2ca9e36f11c03:0x16cf9d7b3ed562a3< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I came here for lunch with my coworker. I've been driving by this place for months and never knew what was inside. The windows are covered from the outside so I couldn't see what was inside.

What We Ordered:
- Ox Tail Fettuccine
- Chaufa Especial

I love the sauces they provide with your bread. I don't know what they are but, they sure are good. I tried both dishes and they were delicious!! I did feel like my Ox Tail Fettuccine was TOO cheesy. I never thought that was possible. I LOVE cheese. Maybe I felt that it overpowered the oxtail to much. However, with a little hot sauce, it made it taste WAYYYYY better! I think it was even better the next day when I had it for leftovers! The Chaufa Especial was delicious as well! My friend just wished the shrimps had their tails removed. I didn't mind though. I will definitely come back!</review>< pics>

Standard Peruvian menu
I ordered the Lomo Saltado on my most recent visit and was again happy with my choice. The quality of the meat is good!

The food overall can be salty if you aren't used to it.

Rocoto has tasty bread that comes out with butter and Peruvian hot sauces that go well with anything you order.

Good experience would come again.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I've always been curious about this place because it was on my daily route to work. I've been told it was a really great place so I finally decided to take the plunge. I was about to get a seat for two rather quickly. I did go on a Monday afternoon so the wait was non existent but I can only imagine what it looks like over the weekend.

The first dish brought to us was a plate of dinner rolls with butter and two dipping sauces. One was a creamy green cilantro sauce that had a really nice flavorful kick too it while the other was some kind of orange sauce. I'm not sure what it was but it was a nice contrast to the other sauce.

We then ordered a plate if fried plantains. It was very delicious. We ended up using the butter from the rolls to coat our plantains with just a little more flavor. Not necessary as the flavor was spot on. It was just a little more kick.

We received our two min dishes rather quickly. We had ordered Peruvian fried rice and the lamp shank.

The fried rice had a mix of beek, pork, and shrimp. From the small sample I had it tasted good. Fried rice is fried rice and it's really hard to mess that up.

The lamb shank was so tender. The meat just slid right off the bone. Either it was cooking all day or they have one hell of a pressure cooker. It was served with a scoop if rice along with beans in a soupy sauce. I loved it so much I practically cleared my plate.

I definitely will be coming back. The menu has so many other interesting dishes that look delicious. This is a wonderful restaurant.<//review><Name>John Ross Gatlin</Name>< Response>

Amazing Peruvian food here! One of the best examples in the area. Try the Second de Cordero! The lamb is full a flavor and not gamy at all. Also try the Arroz Chaufa! It has this sweet flavor to it that is actually quite good!!!< /Review>

This is absolutely the best Peruvian restaurant in Southern Cali!! You can not go wrong with anything you choose here. The ceviche is always mouthwatering fresh, the Lomo saltado is always juicy and the veggies cooked just right. The chicha morada is refreshing. This is defenitely our favorite must when in California.<//Review>

We dined at El Rocoto last night and our experience was excellent! It was a Tuesday night but we had to wait for about fifteen minutes - I didn't mind - a crowded restaurant is a good restaurant. I can wait for good things. We ordered Coke and Inka Cola (I like its cough syrupy flavour). While we savoured the complimentary bread rolls with butter and the dips we waited for our orders - Chaufa Especial (Oriental peruvian fried rice with of shrimp, pork, chicken and beef), and Seco Cordero (Braised lamb shank in cilantro sauce with peruvian beans and rice). The orders arrived after a wait of about fifteen minutes - not bad. The fried rice was very good with plenty of meat, and shrimps with a side of sweet and cool radish slices. The braised lamb shank was juicy, soft and literally falling of the bone, with a side of plain rice, white beans and onions freshly pickled with lemon juice. It was exceptional. The portions were big - we had to pack some of the food to take home. The lady serving us was Latin American - she was very polite and accomodating. She even served us a complimentary caramel custard because it took a little longer for our food to arrive.

I would highly recommend the place. It is as good as El Pollo Inka if not better. Their kitchen closes at 9:30 PM, so get there early.</text>

The worst food ever I do not normally eat Peruvian food . Today I thought It was a good idea , oh my gosh the quality is so bad the price for the amount of food is terrible . Such a small portion and so expensive I order to go . I wish I have never come here .
I would recommend pollo inca.</text>

<name>George In Orbit< /name><Date>1594877035434</Date><rating>1< /rating><Text>(Translated by Google) I bought 2 loins for my brother and me for a weekend, a chaufa rice and a jelly. Spend more than $ 80.00 dollars. When I got home, I open the tenderloin and brought only pieces of stewed and semi-raw meat that was the worst, I had to throw it away because it was not edible, the meat had no cuts for tenderloin. A shame. I tried to give them a second chance weeks later, I called the first person to answer, I deduce that it was a waitress to whom I asked a simple question: if the chef in charge is Peruvian, she said YES. I told him about my past experience: he transferred me to the manager; which told me that the cook is not Peruvian. Obviously not and this business should put its ideas in order. I, as a cousin and nephew of renowned chefs in Latin America and Spain, am used to good cuisine, I can say that at the beginning years ago, the quality and taste of the food in this restaurant called Rocoto was acceptable, not to get excited but acceptable . Now, I am not going to buy here again and I do not recommend anyone to do it and I doubt that I will find a decent Peruvian restaurant in Los Angeles. The cook may be from another country, but the Peruvian flavor is not taught.

(Original)
Compré un fin de semana 2 lomos saltados para mi hermano y para mi, un arroz chaufa y una jalea. Gaste más de $80.00 dólares. Cuando llegué a mi casa, abro el lomo y traía sólo trozos de carne de tamaño estofado y semi-cruda que fue lo peor, lo tuve que tirar a la basura porque no era comestible, la carne no tenia cortes para lomo. Una vergüenza. Intenté darles una segunda oportunidad semanas después, llame por teléfono la primera persona en responder deduzco que fue una camarera a la cual le hice una simple pregunta: si el chef encargado es peruano, me dijo SI. Le comenté mi pasada experiencia: me transfirió a la manager; la cual me dijo que el cocinero no es peruano. Obviamente no y este negocio debería de ordenar sus ideas. Yo, como primo y sobrino de chefs reconocidos en Latinoamérica y España estoy acostumbrado a la buena cocina, puedo decir que al principio hace años, la calidad y el sabor de la comida de este restaurante llamado Rocoto era aceptable, no para tirar cohetes pero aceptable. Ahora, no pienso volver a comprar de nuevo aquí y no recomiendo a nadie que lo haga y dudo que encuentre un restaurante peruano decente en Los Angeles. El cocinero puede ser de otro país si pero la sazón peruana no se enseña.<//Text>< Pictures>
