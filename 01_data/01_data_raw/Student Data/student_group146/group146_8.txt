Went on 1/2/2021 to ask for an upgrade and add a third line. Turns out, it's "migrating" not activating so they just asked us to call customer services. I was like.... We are right there with our ID and credit card, can't they just work on it? No. Asked can they call? No. Absolutely no services. The associate even said, "well, if I call, I'll have to wait for half an hour, still probably faster than you but you have to call yourself" and refused to help. Horrible service.</text>

<text>If I could give no stars I would. Worst customer services ever.... I was told to wait out side and that some one would help me shortly 20 mins later I'm still waiting to be helped. So i tried to get the the guys attention to tell him id have to come back another day, but he just ignored me like I wasnt there. I even said excuse me but he just continued to talk and ignored me   im definitely not ever going back to this tmobile again .<//text>< Response>

< review>
Both Javier & his associate Nick were totally AMAZING.
After having 2 of the worst experiences EVER at T-MOBILE on Huntington Drive in South Pasadena with  rude person named "Raymond" I was freaked out to go to another TMOBILE store.
The two gentlemen that helped me were kind, helpful, clear, business like and were the total opposite of my other experience.
I recommend them and their service's withthe utmost conviction.< /review>

I never really had a bad experience here and the associates are usually very helpful. I went for Black Friday and although they warned me about the systems being pretty slow (which they were) I had patience enough to wait to get my mom an upgraded phone and the rep Miguel was very friendly and nice and so very helpful. Although I can’t say the same for the manager/ supervisor there. David I believe his name was. He was very unfriendly and condescending when it came time for him to make a sales pitch to us. We didn’t want to switch plans or take the promo going on at the time for the car alert system thing they offer. But he kept coming back to remind us how we’d be saving money and get more for what we pay for. But his tone was unwelcome and he pretty much told us it’s our funeral for not going with this “amazing deal” I think they need to re-evaluate him as a leader because he was very rude, unkind, unfriendly and not welcoming at all. I might have considered his offer if he sold it to us in a much better manner.< /Text>

Worse service ever. I just want to change my carry on from Att to T-mobile. They are very fast to charge the payment Happily. However, it took about 1hour to activate the account, and it seemed the employee in the store DONT KNOW how to transfer the account. They wasted my one hour, and there is no seat in the store. Worst service ever.
Don’t go to this store!<//text>

I remembered why now I don't bring my business to this place. Tonight just confirmed why. Their more about sales and masking money than actuallyh helping people. Manager to he looked like an idiot. They were lying to me acting like ij don t know what's going on. I've been through with tmobioe multiple times. This place is too amateur for business account. Will never come here again. I rushed over for no damn reason, wasters a lyft ride and energy to even talk to these people. You want real service then don t come here. Go to Pasadena store on lake.< /review>

Lazy workers ! Every time I go there is  atleast 5 workers and only 2 of them are working while the others laugh and joke around . There is only 4 seats for all the customers they have waiting standing up in the hot room( no ac )  . Workers hostpatality is zero and they have no intention of helping out . As a customers stake holder consumer I am really dissatisfied with this store specifically. The workers managers and staff need to get fired or they need to have a new change with the ethics of its workers . I know the corporation of T-Mobile would not like to be represented like this .<//Review>

<text>Needed to get new phones for me, my wife and two kids. Went into Tmobile just to check out their prices and plans and ended up walking out a customer. Krista was the person who helped us and was so awesome. She explained everything clearly and in detail and made the whole process smooth and enjoyable. She made sure to get us all the promotions that would help us and went above and beyond to make sure everything worked out for us.

We went in near closing time and she stayed until 10:30pm to make sure our phones ported over and everything was taken care of properly. I don’t think we would’ve switched over if it wasn’t for Krista and her being so helpful.

We were able to get a better deal than at AT&T and were able to get iPhones for our kids who desperately wanted them. They have great deals going on like 4th line free and a buy 1 get 1 free phone special.

This Tmobile is right on the corner of Atlantic and Valley so it’s easy to spot. It’s also a real Tmobile, not one of those authorized dealer places. I’ll definitely come back here whenever I need anything for my phone.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Great customer service but wasted my time here. I was there to switch accounts to business and didn't save any money. Why would I even care about services I will never use. There is no point. If I knew I would of just called in. Instead I'm there switching accounts believing I will save some money. I actually lost money for not being at work instead. Man smh. Anyone can apply for ein number and get business account. You can get ahead of line that way no wait. Switch over to business if you have personal. It's free like I said just go irs website and applied for number. That and you get plans first and jump 3 times a year. Doesn't make sense to me to waste all that time of lying to wait more. Now my account is all over the place switching back and forth. In the end she bribed me $50 to stay with business and I said no you can't buy me with money. She said I would still get the credit. Never happened. Just a bunch of bs and broken promises. They don't make the rules but hey they represent tmobile. In the end I wasted time and money and was pretty much on the phone with tmobile all day and night because of that stupid business switch. I lost money instead of making money. That's how they start off with helping a business. It's a joke to me. The fact that she still didn't give me credit only showed that she was really bribing me with a one time 50 dollar credit to stay and desperate for sales. It ducks because I thought they were good people. Most of them were but I will never go in there again. And this is already the second chance I gave them as a regular customer come back and it's definitely not a place I would recommend friends to go. I would rather drive further or just call tmobile themselves it's worth the wait than the headache. But tmobile in all just gives you a headache they explain the good stuff but not the bad stuff. And after you switch to new plan their like oh well we can't change it because so and some it's like their system always want them to win. Anyway I'm trying to find a new service. Going to return everything I can and have them bill me. Their who company as a whole is a joke. That's why their giving out a bunch of free stuff. Just to get customers to switch. But I'll tell you one thing. though. At first I promoted tmobile after calling ciusomter care  and going Into the store my belief has went down like 90 percent. I would not recommend any friends or family to this spot or tmobile themselves.< /Review>

Service here is just terrible.  I have been waiting for two hours,  and still waiting. We have four staffs here,  three of them are working, one just chill around. And they only serviced two customers in the past two hours.  Staffs are not concentrated at work,  but keeps chatting with each others. If I'm not for urgent issues and other stores are close,  I would be long gone.</Text>

5 to 10 minutes, maybe understandable , 15 minutes and over starting to cut into peoples lunch time !
Burrito chicken was cold , you will think because they just open ( and took their time !) food will be warm ! 2 stars because I was super clean ,
If they start respecting peoples time and be more consistent with food this place will be awesome!< /text>< pics>

Sometimes they get your online order right. Sometimes you are in for a surprise. Also their app has no mechanism for feedback.

Despite this it's my kid's go to place and the food is quite decent.</review>

<Review>Service was poor just like before.  I presented with two other coworkers and the teenagers were putting together to go orders. They didn't want to help us because they had phone orders to make. I had to remind them that they had customers right in front of them at that very moment.  The girl was puzzled. No sense of customer service.  She took our order once she realized we weren't going away.  $14 for a bowl and drink? Kinda steep for Chipotle. Go next door to Westpark and pay $3 more for deliciousness AND excellent service. When you're there, get the Salmon bowl.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>Customer service, common sense/courtesy and basic job requirements seem to be nonexistent. Pros: Glad there are vegan options, i.e. bowl with rice and veggies (optional 'sofritas' which is seasoned tofu, but its too spicy for me.) Not too pricey, good location. Cons: 1.) I dislike that the last time, an employee charged me for an item that they didn't give me and didn't even offer me my receipt, then proceeded to argue that I was in fact missing that item. 2.) A time before that, I had tried scanning my rewards barcode for my free chips, yet they still charged me after scanning. (I had to use the scanner myself which is a bit odd.) The "manager" accused me that I had either already used the coupon (I had not) or it was for my next visit (no, it was for that current visit.) Then, changed to speaking Spanish, and fussed at the employee for not paying attention and making a mistake (they didn't know I understood.) The manager said they could try again or offer a refund. At that point I was beyond irritated and got a refund and left. 3.)The inside is still understandably closed for dining due to covid but the outside is available...yet they don't bother to clean/sanitize their outside dining at all. Tables are always covered and caked in days worth of bird droppings and trash from previous patrons, as well as dust and ash. Other restaurants are on top of cleaning their outside dining, so why does Chipotle behave as though they are exempt? I'm giving one more chance because the human resources offered me 2 free entrees. Good luck.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Online/mobile pickup order came out wrong.

Ordered crispy tacos and got soft. My wife and mother in law are gluten free so this was a bummer to get all the way back to the hotel after a long day of travel and realize they messed up the order.

Advice to the people (and myself) using the chipotle app, always check your orders when you pick them up. Even if they seem busy and they staple the bag shut.</Text><response>None</response><userid>108877733995227540667< /userid><GmapID>0x808fa3ad2f8fc8cb:0x3363c25604380419</GmapID><user_name>Joshua Cabe Johnson<//user_name><rating>2<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<date>1568571518128<//date><rating>3< /rating><review>I love Chipotle, and this one serves Redwood City reasonably well. We’ve had some issues recently with their consistency - some days portions are tiny, some days they’re large. Some days the chips are slightly burnt, or unsalted, some times they’re too salty. It’s hard to know what you’re going to get, even with their guacamole taste and texture. Which, is basically why most people go to Chipotle - you know what you’re getting and it’s not insanely expensive. It feels like they must have some new cooks or a staff change or something rolling. Hope it resolves soon! Will update if it does.< /review>< pics>

Visited chipotle restaurants too many times to count, this is by far the weakest serving of food I have ever seen. Tiny portion left me hungry despite spending the normal price. I ordered it for delivery, is that the reason it was so small? Because I won’t see it till it has already arrived. Going to a different location next time. I see a lot of other low star reviews with the same issue. Drive to a different location, it’s worth it!!<//Text>

<Text>One of the employees working here have a very bad attitude and underserved very bad. He put one little scoop of meat in my bowl. I could probably count the pieces of meat on two hands when the meat is supposed to be the main part of the meal. I ask him if I could have more and he replies, “you want extra?” Implying that it would cost more. And I said no I would like a normal serving and he kept saying it would be extra. After arguing with him, I was so hungry I said yes I would like extra and my bowl came out to almost $20. Very rude attitude. If he’s working I’m walking< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

It's Chipotle... if Taco Bell is the McDonald's of Mexican food, then Chipotle is the Boston Market of it. Nice regular dishes cooked on the spot, big burritos, but don't expect anything super special. That said, I've never had any issues with this particular restaurant; every time I visit it, I know what I'm getting, and I'm always able to get it.< /review>

I told her I didn’t want lettuce and she said “it says lettuce” and despite her seeing in my face that it wasn’t what I thought I ordered, she didn’t even ask if I wanted another one without lettuce, or to pay for a new one. Won’t be going back to this chipotle. I gave it two stars because she made my burrito fast, despite it being 10 minutes past the time it was scheduled to be ready.< /review>< pics>

This location is terrible and keeps getting worse. The staff are always new and still being trained, the portion sizes are inconsistently small, they try to put the opposite of what you ask for in your dish (white or brown rice, black or pinto beans), no one can ever wrap a burrito without ripping it.<//review>

The food is good but this place is very unorganized.theres no leadership and the manager is not easily visible because all the employees wear the same uniform. I’ve eaten at quite a few of these Chipotle’s across the country and the manager  is not easily recognizable. My manager sent me to lunch at 1040am. I checked to see what time they open. Website stated 10:45am so I arrive at 10:50am and even though it’s posted on door open daily at 10:45am they didn’t open the door until 11:03am. They even made a delivery service driver that was picking up a catered order from Chipotle wait outside with the rest of us. I finally get my order filled and I can’t pay because the register doesn’t have cash to make change. Employee tells me to go ahead and eat and he will let me know when I can pay. I then get my drink and start to pour from the tea container and it’s empty!! Like I stated, there doesn’t seem to be any leadership here.<//Review>

The food is good most of the time. However the attitude of the employees at this particular Chipotle is not welcoming or friendly. This is in comparison to other Chipotle restaurants in the area. For some reason, the Redwood City Chipotle employees all seem like they would rather have nobody buying their food or eating in the restaurant. I will make every effort to patronize the other Chipotle restaurants before coming to this one.<//text>

Great food as always from Chipotle. Portions were no bigger nor lesser than usual. They served us very close to closing time and thought nothing of it, almost like they didn't know what time they were closing.

I had a Carnitas Burrito, wife had a Carnitas bowl.<//review>

I used to go here all the time for lunch until the e-coli outbreak... It was good and I never got sick, but I'm hesitant to go back. Perhaps after some more time passes without incident. I do miss the guac.</Text>

This place decided to lock doors at 9:40p, even though closing time is 10p?  I hope this location goes out of business because their location sucks, you have to park around the block or in underground garage.< /review>

<text>Eduardo and Jacob did a great job installing replacement patio slider and 2 bedroom windows.  On time, very neat and very polite. Took the time to answer all my questions. Definitely recommend Hometime Windows & Doors. I called their Upland location.<//text>< pictures>

Hometime Windows and Doors were great. I am glad I found them. They were very professional and prompt. The estimate was quick and easy. Other companies gave an estimate on rough measurements and had to send another guy out to re-measure. Hometime did it all at once. The installers were prompt and courteous. The windows look phenomenal. We are getting more windows done and are definitely using them again.</Text>

Hometime was great. From start to finish it was really easy, and they were very professional. Getting the quote was easy and zero pressure. Their prices were on point with the 3 other quotes we got. The install was a great experience. They arrived on time, finished the project in less time than quoted, wore masks the entire time, and were really careful about where they walked (they laid down blankets) and did a great job cleaning up. I’ve had several projects done on my house and there’s always a mess I have to clean up afterwards - not with Hometime! I will be going back to them for other projects.< /text>

I spent a lot of time researching window replacement companies.  We settled on Hometime Windows and Doors after careful review of four companies and their quotes.

From the quote to the installation, we found Hometime to be professional, considerate, courteous, accommodating, and responsive.

Of the four companies that came to measure our windows and sliding door, Brian from Hometime did the most extensive examination of the existing windows and took the most accurate measurements (I personally observed all measurements and had some concerns about the accuracy of measurements taken by the other companies).

On the day of the installation, Israel and Nate arrived a bit earlier than scheduled.  They arrived wearing masks in consideration of the COVID pandemic concerns and introduced themselves to us.  They walked throughout the house, and around the exterior of the house, to examine the exiting windows and sliding door to confirm the order before starting the removal of the existing windows and sliding door.

Earlier, I mentioned that they were accommodating.  We have a large dog that needed a place to be kept while the work was on going throughout the house.  I asked Israel if they could replace the garage window first so that we could keep the dog there while work was being performed around the rest of the house.  Israel was very accommodating and replaced the garage window first, including the inside trim.

In all, we had 17 windows to be replaced and we were quite impressed with the speed and care in which Israel and Nate performed the work, including the replacement of a large, severely termite damaged, window and supporting vertical wood structures, and the kitchen’s corner windows.  All the work, except for the sliding door, was completed in one day with the help of a third crew member that join Israel and Nate mid-morning.  I have been in construction most of my adult life and was certain that it would require two full days to replace all the windows, but I was pleasantly wrong.  The sliding door replacement was completed on the following day.

All the work, including cleanup and haul away of the old windows and sliding door, was completed in the 2 days scheduled.  We are very satisfied with Hometime Windows and Doors’ performance, their products, and the finished work, and would absolutely recommend them to families, friends, and neighbors.

The following photos are just 2 of the 17 windows replaced.  In my opinion, these were the most difficult windows to replace.  All that's left is to clean, sand and paint the sill.<//Text>

Excellent work on my patio doors!  they were efficient, courteous and clean.
I had doors installed by Hometime in 2002 and decided it best to return to them--I'm glad I did.  Their workers are also courteous (they speak to customers as they are entering to begin their work day). I need to get more product so I will be looking to them again.</Review>

I highly recommend Hometime Windows & Doors.  Jaime Sanchez followed up with me on every step of the process. My installers Israel & Jacob were very professional and did a great job installing, not to mention in between the rainy weather. Cleaned up and my windows look awesome.  Next day, the owner, Andrew called to make sure I was happy with my windows.  Customer service is a 10 plus. Great job!  Very professional.  Thank you all again.< /Text>

I picked this company based on the Yelp reviews and the fact that they manufacture their own windows, so they’d be able to quickly make replacements to fit some of the non-standard windows and sliding door in my place. Brian is the one who initially came by to take measurements and talk to me about options and pricing. He was very patient and talked me through each option. Israel and Eli were the ones who came to actually install my new windows a couple weeks later. They were quick, careful not to damage anything, mindful of my cats, and thankfully didn’t seem to mind my messy house. They also cleaned up after themselves. I got the noise-reduction option, and it really makes quite a difference! I have trucks that drive through just a few yards behind my house all night, and now I barely notice them.

<review>Edeer came to our home and gave us an estimate, he was very friendly and professional. He answered all the questions I had and everything was explained very well. When Danny and Eli came to replace our windows and sliding door, they were very professional and did an excellent job!!! Very clean and new what they were doing! Could not of asked for better service! Great company and great people. Will strongly recommend to everyone I know!< /review>< time>

From start to finish the whole process was done professionally and with no pressure. From the start with Edeer coming over presenting the windows to us, to the install with Eduardo and Carlos it was simple and done well. Eduardo and Carlos were on time, which was great because I had to work later in the day. And they were quick and professional about the install. The pricing was great too. I thought I was going to pay more for windows than what the total cost was. Overall I recommend the company and will be getting more windows done in the future.<//review>

<text>We researched a lot before choosing a Window company. We narrowed it down to three in home estimates: a large local market leader, the next largest, and Hometime for being so well reviewed. We ended up choosing Hometime because: Brian who provided the in home estimate was honest, low pressure, professional, knowledgeable and highly responsive to our email and phone inquiries during the estimate process. Secondly, none of the other two companies came close price wise. And finally, when comparing feature by feature and quality of the product provided, Hometime covered all of our needs. Installation was three days ago and we are thrilled. Danny and Charlie were on time, professional, considerate and efficient. They installed 5 windows and a sliding door in 4 hours. My husband, who remodeled most of our home himself, and is very particular and detailed oriented was extremely impressed with the quality of the installation, the attention to detail and we both appreciate the quality of the windows themselves. Also, it was nice to get a post installation follow up from Brian and Andrew, the company owner.< /text>< date>

The Hometime window installers did a great job!  They showed up at 08:00 and with 8 windows and a sliding glass door installed, they were finished at 3:00pm!  They were courteous and professional.   The whole process, from the measurements, written estimate to the installation completion was actually a pleasant experience!   Hats off to Hometime!   👍👍</Review>

The first night after the windows were installed, my wife and I feel the BIG different in the house. Things like the noise from the highway were no longer hear, so we could sleep peaceful. The windows also blocked the cold temperature during the night. There are 15 - 20 degree different when compared to the inside the house and the outside temperatures.
Eduardo and Carlos were our installers for the project. They both  very professional in technical and outstanding clean work. Eduardo and Carlos were also very friendly and customer service oriented. THANK YOU!< /text>< Response>

This was our third round of windows installed by Hometime Windows. We have a lot of windows in our house so we are installing in phases. Each time we have had an outstanding experience and this was no exception. Danny and Charlie made sure that the install was completed to their meticulous standards. The windows look great. They take great pride in the company they represent and the work they perform.  If you need new windows, call Hometime. They will be doing our next round of windows.<//Text>

<review>We recently had our windows and a patio door replaced by Hometime Windows and doors and are very pleased with the results. First the crew, Danny and Charlie were great, they arrived when expected, offered to answer any questions about the process I might have and then proceeded to install our new windows ( I'm not sure they stopped until the job was complete). They were very considerate of our home and left the work site clean  at the end of the job. Again we are very happy with the windows and patio door, what a difference. Great experience.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1607729890431, 'text': 'Hey Michael! Thanks for the glowing review! We will definitely pass on your thanks to Danny and Charlie.

<Text>This is the second time that we have used Hometime Windows. We loved our windows the first time and absolutely love the windows and window shades in our new home. Eduardo and Carlos were the installers and they were extremely professional and left the place clean when they left. You could tell that they prided in the job that they did.  The owner Andrew Durben is so pleasant and works to make sure that you get what you want and are happy with the job.  I would HIGHLY recommend Hometime Windows in Upland, CA</Text>< rating>

Hometime is a great company to work with. I've trusted them with 2 home improvement projects now and they've done an excellent job both times! Everyone at the company is very nice to work with and the products they offer are top quality at a reasonable price. Most recently, I had windows installed by Carlos and Eddie. They were so fast and did a great, clean job! I received a follow-up call after the installation asking if I had any issues but I honestly had nothing to complain about. The guys did a perfect job and I've gotten lots of compliments on the new windows already!<//review>

From start to finish, we had a great experience with Hometime Windows.  The estimater was friendly, professional, informative and not pushy.  The quote was delivered quickly.  It was clear and comparable or better than other quotes.  And the installers were great.  They were courteous, careful, and professional and they worked fast (they definitely deserve a bonus)!  The windows look beautiful!  The owner of the company even called a few days after install just to check up and make sure everything went smoothly and to see if I had any additional questions.  It just seems like this company really cares about treating the customer well.  If I ever have a need for additional window repair or install, I would definitely go with Hometime.</review>

Hometime windows is a hassle free no price haggling & has the best price around.
To be honest I was originally going to go through American vision windows (because I used them 4 years ago) and they were going to charge me about $2,000 more than Hometime windows for the exact same millguard window.
I would HIGHLY recommend Hometime! The no price haggling they give you the best price upfront is what I LOVE! Andrew was great as well as Israel & Nate (who installed my windows). They showed up early, cleaned up after installing and made sure everything was good.< /text>

Kudos to the installers of our mom’s new windows. Eduardo and Carlos arrived on time and transformed the house by replacing the original single pane windows with Hometime’s beautiful and efficient windows. Quality workmanship and professionalism during the entire process! Very happy mom was beaming about her new windows! Thank you!<//Text>

< Review>
I'm very impressed! I thought, "there is no way they are going to get those windows installed in one day!"  They did. They worked calmly and methodically and were superb. Hometime Windows did a great job for me. I still have half a house to do. As soon as I can afford it, I will be back. THX!< /Review>

Hometime was the last of five companies we had come out and quote us for replacing all the windows in our home. We ended up chosing them on the spot and couldn't be happier. Edeer and Michael were very professional during the in home estimate, were COVID safe, and were able to give the detailed quote on the spot. Prices were very competitive and for the features (sound package glass), given similar specs to other major brand windows.  Time to install was three weeks, much better than the other companies were able to quote.
The install team led by Danny and Eli was fantastic, describing each step of the work, and had all 17 windows installed in one day. They accommodated me asking them to do one room first, so we could move our cat in there and not worry about him the rest of the day. One window had a different lock than ordered, and they came to me and had already called it in to be fixed asap. Fantastic company with great employees, true work ethic, attention to detail, and great customer service. The owner of the company followed up a few days after install to ensure everything met our expectations, a nice touch. I would absolutely recommend Hometime windows to anyone looking for new windows! It's only been a few days and the difference is more than we expected, they look fantastic and eliminated the temperature swings and drafts we previously had in the home.<//Text>

Danny and Charlie were very professional and efficient. Our sliding glass door is beautiful and it keeps out the heat. The work was clean and we are able to enjoy the view of our backyard. Danny even suggested a roll down shade which we are very interested in. We look forward to using Home time again in the near future.

Thanks,

<text>First positive contact was Edeer presenting Hometime Windows for our choices and available options.  He was very friendly and with all the Covid19 safety requirements, he was very respectful of our concerns.  Because of his pleasant presentation, we had agreed to replacing all our windows including patio door.
Then the installers Peter and Carlos took over the work a few days later.  Very meticulous to the point that Peter said he wasn’t too pleased with the patio door making a little bump on its tracks.  The follow up phone call from Zak was quick and was there to fix the issue.
These guys will make your house even more beautiful.  The windows and doors we are extremely happy with and I feel better looking at my house now.  The staff will make your day and I am very happy to endorse them all to any body.  Hometime Windows need to be known even more.</text>< Pics>

This was my first experience at a professional salon and I was absolutely wowed! I saw Roni and she did an AMAZING job cutting my curly hair. I’ve never received a haircut I’ve liked and that worked for my curly hair before—she definitely knows what she’s doing! She was so friendly, upbeat, and professional, and I will definitely be making this place my permanent go-to! Also amazing that everything they use is cruelty free!< /Text>

< review>
I have been a client of Citrus Since 2010.  Tessa fixed a bad color job from another salon and has always done an amazing job.  I trust her enough to sit down and let her do what she feels is best - with little input.  The citrus team continually gets new training to keep their skills sharp and learn new techniques.  You really can’t go wrong with any of the stylists.  I fly back to Martinez from NYC to have my hair done at Citrus!<//review>

<Text>I've been a client at Citrus for about four years now and have been so impressed with this establishment from the beginning! (Even back when it was a small salon across the street :) ). It is clean, high-end (but not snooty!), and everyone who works here is professional and down to earth at the same time. I look forward to each visit, not only because I KNOW that my hair is going to look amazing, but because I also get to see my stylist, Chelsea. She is fun, personable, friendly, and turns "just getting a haircut" into a luxurious salon experience. It is so awesome to have a stylist who you fully trust, makes you feel like family, and turns you into hair goals! I LOVE Citrus and Chelsea! Highly recommend this salon!!< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been coming here for 18 months and their covid precautions suffice.  I have had 4 different stylists do my hair and they all perform at a high level. I trust anyone at this salon to cut/color my hair.  I feel comfortable getting my hair done here because they require masks, take your temp, ask you questions about how you feel and who you’ve been around, and are socially distanced.< /Text>

I love Citrus Salon. The stylists are not only professional but personable as well. I love my hair because they love my hair. It shows in the beautiful work they do. It’s a treat to have my hair done by them.  They are always on top of their game and consistently learning about the latest trends. I’m one of their older customers but they make me feel young again with their vibrant energy. Love love love Citrus Salon! Highly recommend!</text>

I have been going to citrus salon for hair care/product needs for a little over 2 years now. Everything about this place is amazing. You feel relaxed and taken care of immediately walking in.
Chelsea is awesome! She is a balayage master and love my color every time I get it done. We’ve cut long hair to short and In between- and i leave with a style that I love!!  Also to mention, she is super sweet and funny- always a good conversation while she’s working her magic!! You’ll love Citrus 🍊<//Text>

<text>Citrus Salon is an incredible Aveda Salon in downtown Martinez! From the minute you walk in, you’re greeted with smiles and a glass of your favorite beverages. My amazing stylist is Chelsea - I went to her because she has absolutely gorgeous hair. I’m so glad I did, because now people comment on MY gorgeous hair! She’s attentive, efficient and super down to earth. I genuinely look forward to our appointments together, and once you meet her, you will too.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp><user_id>115292367271404003713</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have been going to Citrus for almost 10 years, and they have NEVER disappointed. The atmosphere, the service, and the overall team are awesome. Specifically, my stylist, Roni, is AMAZING !! I entirely trust her with my hair and am always happy with the result (which is hard considering I never know what I want/what I’ll like). She’s so caring, personable and fun to talk to! Highly recommend. She’s just the best :) !!<//review><user_name>Isabella Colarusso< /user_name><time>1582177308257< /time><Rating>5</Rating><gmap_id>0x80856f84708ff37f:0xc1fe22fe03981c5a<//gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

I love Citrus Salon and have been loyal to them for years no one else touches my hair. All the styles and staff are so friendly and helpful. The location is excellent and they are so community oriented it is heart warming to see. Chelsea is amazing she knows her way around a head of hair! Great with color cuts and style. I never feel pressure to do something I’m not comfortable with and I always look forward to my appointment!!< /text>

Chelsea is nothing more than spectacular from coloring, and styling my hair to you name it!!
She will do whatever I ask her to do plus has wonderful suggestions if I’m not sure what to do with it. Chelsea gets it!!!

In fact she is the most magical hairdresser I have had the privilege to experience——A superb hairdresser with a loving-wit about her too.

In fact I recently setup an appointment for my daughter who loves my hair so much for March of 2020 and trust me, she is majorly selective about who color’s, cut’s and/or highlight’s her hair!!

Chelsea has a super-duper positive, bubbly kind of energizing and contagious personality!! Seriously, I will walk into Citrus Salon sometimes feeling frumpy, and walk out feeling happy and hot!! She is ton’s of fun plus extremely professional at the same time!! You won’t be disappointed because she makes the Citrus Salon a win, win adventure and I encourage y’all to give Chelsea at Citrus Salon a chance!!< /review>

Chelsea! So talented. And fun to be around. Like catching up with an old friend you’ve known forever every time you see each other. The establishment is always spotless and a glass of wine is always waiting for you to help relax and unwind as you get pampered.</Review>

I started going Citrus Salon maybe 6-8 months ago and absolutely love it! My boss has been going there for years and has always recommended it to me. Nikki has been working on my hair for a few visits now and is amazing to work with. She is extremely personable, fun to chat with and of course has done an amazing job on my hair. I’m currently going through a transformation where she cut off 8-10 inches and now we’ll be lightening it! I highly recommend Citrus for anyone looking for a salon who is happy to accommodate the wants for your hair but also to keep it healthy.</review>

Chelsea is amazing!!! Not only do you enjoy your treatment and walk away looking fabulous but she’s like a personal therapist at the same time. This girl is so friendly and energetic I love being around her. She also pushes me to try new styles with my hair which is something I RARELY do. She is highly trained on all things hair and style so I always know I’m in good hands with her. She is the only stylist I’ve had that I have ever had color my hair and she will make sure it’s absolutely perfect before you leave. If you ever have the opportunity to get an appointment with her (because she’s so awesome that her calendar is always full) take it!!<//Review>

I've been getting my hair cut at Citrus Salon for a few years now. I see Nikki and Chelsea. They are both professional and have great style. I even get to have a beer while I have my hair cut. What else could I ask for! The salon is cool and the entire staff is awesome. Thank you Chelsea & Nikki.</Review>

I tell anyone who will listen about Citrus.  Just walking into the salon is a treat- the space is beautiful and everyone who works thee is warm and professional.  I have been going to Nikki for about 2 years.  Nikki is so pleasant and helpful- she really listens when I talk about my hair needs and makes suggestions when I am not sure what I want.  The result is always great- my hair feels and looks amazing!< /text>

<text>I have been going to Citrus for the past 4-5 years  and have only had positive experiences. Nikki is my go-to stylist for all needs, mainly color (balayage, highlights) and cut.

If you’re new, she’s really attentive to your needs and what you’re trying to achieve. She’ll ask a lot of questions and give you honest feedback ahead of time, so you’re not surprised by the end result or the daily maintenance involved to achieve the look. She’s also just a fun, sweet human being who keeps it real and fun throughout the entire session.

I’d highly recommend her to anyone, but beware, she does book quickly. Thank you Nikki and the Citrus team for always being there to spruce up my hair needs 🙂< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1618942780546, 'text': "Thank you Danae!

<Text>I recently went for a root touch up and cut. My stylist was Viviana who was professional, thoughtful and just did a wonderful job. My hair had been through a grow-out phase and was scraggly. She was able to make my hair shiny, bouncy, and it now looks full! My color is fantastic! Viviana knows her craft!!!<//Text></record>

Chelsea is an extremely skilled and talented stylist. She takes the time to listen to what I want, give honest feedback if she doesn’t think it will work, helps me understand my hair, and importantly, leaves me feeling beautiful! She’s amazing and Citrus is a little gem in Martinez!<//Text>

Nikki is the best hair stylist I’ve ever had, period! She has transformed my hair and gave it life! I explained to her what color I wanted and she always delivered, even when I decided to chop it short. The quality of the products is simply a cherry on top, citrus salon is the best salon I’ve ever been to and I always leave with a smile on my face. Aesthetically pleasing, easy to find parking, the staff is so so so nice & aveda is the best hair product!<//text>

Chelsea is by far the full package when it comes to hair! She always greats you with a huge smile is the first to give suggestions/ recommendations on new hair styles/ color etc while making sure you’re 100% satisfied and comfortable with every step. I have been going to Chelsea since she’s been with Citrus and could not even imagine going to another stylist! Highly highly recommend and can’t wait to see her soon!<//Text>

I’ve gotten my hair cut, colored, styled (you name it!) by Chelsea a few times and I’m always SO happy with the outcome. She is positive, outgoing, talented and really cares about her clients (the whole Citrus team does). The salon is very well maintained, always tidy, and oh so Instagram-able 😜. I went in for their “Blow Out for St. Baldrick’s” event on Sunday and left looking and feeling fab! Thank you for the confidence boost, Chelsea! And thank you to the whole Citrus team for going above and beyond to support your clients and your community 🍊✨</text>

I have gone to Heather now for over 4 months on a monthly basis and I have been very happy with her and very happy with this salon.  It's great to get a person on the phone when your setting up your appointment and not having to play phone tag with your stylist like I had to with my last stylist.  Heather really takes pride in what she does and it shows by how well your hair looks.  I highly recommend her if your looking for a new stylist and definitely recommend this salon.  Very nice staff.< /text>

<Review>I've been seeing Chelsea at Citrus Salon in Martinez for over a year, and I feel like I've finally found MY hair person. She's always wonderful - great attitude, very friendly and personable, and has a knack for knowing what I want/what will work for me even though I'm never very specific about it. I've had her do everything from highlights to gray coverage, pastel dyes to bangs, and I've never left disappointed. She's fast, too, which is a major plus for me (I work in the city and have two littles to chase after when I'm home, so time is not something I have a lot of). I also very much appreciate that she's so knowledgeable about products, but never pushy about upselling. The salon overall is very clean and full of lovely, friendly people, and the few times I've had other stylists cut my bangs or do my daughter's hair have been equally great. Finally, the location is ideal, near coffee and decent parking. Give these people your money!!<//Review><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I’m honestly very happy with my experience at Citrus. I don’t normally do reviews but everyone was very friendly and I was especially happy with my haircut. Lindsay did my hair and was so nice. I’ve never been happier with a haircut. Lindsay actually listened to what I wanted which was refreshing. I am trying to grow out my hair and she kept my length but gave me shape. I RECOMMEND HER ESP TO THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THEIR HAIR CHOPPED. My hair felt LONGER after she was done! Super happy!</Review>

Citrus is the only salon I trust with my hair. Vicky does a great job on my hair. I've also had styling done by Viviana which was amazing as well. Super welcoming environment. I highly recommend!</Review>

Roni is my stylist and she is flawless! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a stylist , I’m particularly picky, So anyone who’s obsessed with their hair like I am, Roni is your girl! It’s been soo rough trying to find someone good, I’ve been salon hopping everywhere just to find the one. And prayers were finally answered.
Roni is soo sweet, fun, very professional and highly experienced. I sent her some photos of what I was trying to achieve and Roni accomplished it plus more. Roni is the best! She goes above and beyond her job description!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

my wife had the worst experience with ADAN ARTEAGA. He advised a strategy to do her hair did it for $300 dollars and came out horrible. was willing to repair but charge her $35 and still did a horrible job. all i can say is absolutely incompetent with a serious attitude to boot. buyers beware.</Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>My friend died her hair with semi-permanent blue dye about 2 months ago. We went in and they promised to get all the blue out and dye it a really pretty blonde color. We showed them a picture of exactly what she wanted which had the length and color she wanted and again they promised that they would easily be able to do that for her. They told us it would be $200 maybe $250 at the very most and then it ended up being $285 for something we didn’t want. It was only that much because the appointment  went for longer since they couldn’t do what they promised in the right amount of time and still after more time, didn’t do it. After over 3 hours, we paid too much for hair that wasn’t the right color of blonde, still had blue in it, and wasn’t even the right length. My friend can’t stop crying because of how much they messed it up. Can’t believe this.<//Text><rating>1</rating>< user>

This is my second time and they gave me to a new stylist since the original is going on maternity.  She took the original cut made it a bit shorter and I love it.  I think the first was a bit nervous because we were taking over two feet off.
I haven't done color yet since I kind of like how my faded color blends with my natural in the back.  We're also waiting for my at-home dye job to grow out more before we decide.< /review>< Pics>

< review>
I had an excellent experience! I have some serious trust issues with my hair, so I always have anxiety when going to get my hair cut or colored because of past bad experiences at other salons. But today Santiago did an amazing job! He did an excellent and natural-looking balayage. I have very long, hard to tame hair that has gone through some bad dying experiences in the past but this was the best experience by far. He was so friendly, honest, and helpful. My hair looked so beautiful I could cry. I would highly recommend this place!< /review>

My Experience: Candance is very Sweet and so is her staff with that said and done, I scheduled a 3:00 pm appointment with Candance, because I heard she is the best.
I work in Martinez about a 12 minute drive away I left at 2:45 to ensure that I make it their on time, although traffic was a bit heavy i made it by 3:05 pm. Maybe I should have mentioned that I was on a lunch break although I did anticipate to be somewhat late, by the time her assistant started the drying process it was 4 p.m...because i have lots of thick hair and i think its common sense to dry the inside roots to cut the drying and styling process in half, but am not the professional right? So now 4:10 pm  with my hair half wet I say sorry but i don't have the time to dry it. what I actually wanted to say was give me the brush i will do it myself but that would have been rude so instead I asked her to use the paddle brush so that i could get back to my office. other wise at the rate she was going It would have taken at least another half hour, so now instead of having the full service I left feeling like the I was a being a difficult client, mind you now its 4:30 so shame on me for not allowing a two hour window for a cut and blow dry. But the fact remains the stylist Candance said after they finished the drying process she was going add her finishing touches,  but I had to ask her if she could check it out and the fact that she had to step away for a client who she was doing a color process just made me feel worst. By the way my hair is long about bra strap length and did I mention i have a lot of hair not coarse but thick. On the price check list it said $50-$60 long hair tell me why I paid $70+ tip  and although she is great at what she does I felt I could have went to your super cut and gotten the same service. I am so disappointed.  Although I realize would I had not had to get back to work my experience would have been worth my while and my money. I have paid good money to have my hair done many times but never left feeling like a difficult client< /Text>

<review>What a fantastic place for lunch. We were a group of 10 and had great fun. Everything we ordered was delicious and generously portioned. The jack chicken was fantastic, the wings were pinut buttery, and the atmosphere and services were friendly. We would definitely go there again.<//review>< pics>

<Time>1361476436305</Time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I used to eat here very regularly (at one point 2-3 times a week for breakfast and/or lunch), and make it a point to stop by during Giants game days if I'm in the city. Primo delivers consistently great value for delicious jerk chicken and fried catfish, whether served in a pita, on a sandwich, or with rice. The spicy mayo sauce served with the fries is insanely addictive. I love sitting out on the back patio with a great lunch accompanied by a Red Stripe beer on warm days. The place is nearly always packed during lunchtime, so I'm sure others agree. :) Service is friendly, folksy and genuinely thankful for your business.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>The lady at the counter screams orders to the kitchen in terrible broken Spanish. She is unorganized & does not give food in order. So I got the jerk chicken entree. & I watch this loopy lady take cash then place a container of thousand island dressing in my box on top of my food. Then she hands me utensils & puts her filthy hands on the part I eat from.
Now let’s get to the food! It is Mexican food with a Caribbean twist. My chicken was undercooked so was my crunchy rice. The black beans were bland. Does any of that sound like it needed thousand island dressing? Don’t waste your $ this place is terrible!< /Review></record>

Food is to die for...patio is one of the best places to enjoy a nice day. They have sangria which is delicious...and just make sure you get there early for lunch, as it gets pretty crowded. Good spot since it is sheltered from the wind too and they have umbrellas for those rare hot days in SF...</review>

<Review>I used to go to Primo Patio a lot when I worked near here.  They have the best cajun-style blackened snapper sandwiches that comes with seasoned fries and their yummy house sauce called Primo sauce. The snapper and the jerk chicken are my favorites.  I like that you can sit outside and that they have heated lamps on cold days.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  It's a wonderful mini-escape from the grind.</Review>< pics>

Only the best jerk chicken in San Francisco!!!! The fried plantains here are to die for as well. Stay away from the jerk steak (overcooked and under-seasoned) and all that other fried stuff though (yes, the fried stuff is delicious but you can get just as tasty fried stuff as Popeyes). Don't say I didn't warn you! The last time I was here with a friend, she got persuaded by the owner to order the fried catfish even though I told her that she was making the worst decision of her life. Guess what? I was right. She took one bite of my jerk chicken and teared up a little. OK fine, maybe she didn't cry, but she was feeling some serious buyer's remorse!

Be forewarned, there is only outdoor seating here so if you come on a sunny day for lunch, get your butt over there by 11:40 latest or you'll have to wait for a table. Sadly, this place is not open for dinner.< /text>

<Text>Total hole-in-the-wall spot that you'd walk right by if you weren't looking out for it.

From the outside it looks like nothing. Walk through to the back patio, though, and you discover a totally cute oasis in the middle of SoMa. The staff is rude in the best way... super efficient, not wasting their time, not messing around. Food arrives super fast and is high quality. I had the sweet plantains, which were cut thick, sticky, and paired perfectly with the primo sauce on the side. I also had the tropical tacos for two - they're not kidding on the portion size! This appetizer for two is a HEAVY meal for one, but super delicious. Thick chunks of fried fish over black beans, cabbage, and veggies.

Perfect destination for a sunny day, but get here early, this place fills up!</Text>< pictures>

I just love this place. Sitting out in the courtyard eating amazing food with a very chilled vibe is a must-do south of market.</Review>

They serve their lemonade in a hilariously big cup. Oh, and they have really good food at a good price and outdoor seating and all that good stuff too. I enjoyed the jerk chicken, but most of the food looked equally good.</Review>

Fun hole-in-the-wall spot in the center of SoMa with a cozy patio out back and great Carribean food. Jerk Chicken Sandwich is a favorite for lunch, and definitely try the Buli-Buli to drink with friends. Owners are delightful, active in the business, and will recognize you and say hi if you're regular.</review>

<Review>What a cute place, a whole in the wall and only an outside patio! The food was good but a very typical mexican whole in the wall restaurant. They don't have a full liquor license but they have ok sangria. Its a fun place to go before a Giants game but I don't think I'd eat there regularly!< /Review><Rate>3< /Rate><username>Kimberly Wiedermann<//username><userid>114586216573637169020</userid><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmap_id>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>Primo Patio is a fantastic lunch spot, especially if you're in the mood for jerked chicken. For those trying to be healthy, the jerked chicken salad is where it's at. It's got the greens and is incredibly filling. However, my favorite thing to get there is the sandiwich, which is always delicious and comes with Primo's special fries that are deliciously seasoned. If you are ordering take out, make sure to bring cash to avoid any headaches!< /Text>< UserId.>

I almost don't want to review this as it is a hidden gem of a place.  They have an awesome back patio that gets a fair amount of sun and no wind.  The food is excellent and the drinks are great.  They have good sangria as well as Buli-Buli which is a beer and lime juice mix that is refreshing and tasty.  The food is Caribbean and the portions are huge!  The prices are also extremely reasonable and it is safe to say this may be my new pre-game go to spot.</text>

<Review>Alright had to give a shout out to my favorite lunch spot in SOMA. That's a statement right there as there are heeelllllaaa good spots in SOMA just about everywhere. I love this place so much for mixed reasons. 1st, every Wednesday and Friday they have their famous "Jerk Pork." This is the best plate of food they offer, and I go here solely for this dish. Get there at least a quarter till 12 as it sometimes sells out by 130 or 2.  If it happens to be sold out or not a Wed. or Fri., the jerk chicken, or lamb platter will suffice.

2end reason I love this place is the primo patio! No but really out back is really calming and chill. It's outside, and is usually sunny with a 100% chance of good vibes. If it tends to be chilly, they have heat lamps around to make you feel that Jamaican love. Hurrrraaaay BEER~!

Overall ambiance+food = 5 stars. Loved it.< /Review><Name>Nathan Rango<//Name><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Doesn't look like much from the front, but the back patio (OMG THE NAME MAKES SENSE NOW) is a great place to escape from SOMA, get a little sun, and have a great meal. The lightly fried bits of snapper and primo sauce is a personal favorite, everything on the menu is great.</Review>< pictures>

They're usually very knowledgeable of their ingredients so you can order carefully, but severe gluten allergies may lose out as cross contamination between wheat and the other food items appears to be inevitable.<//Review>

Chuy's mechanics are the best in the Coachella Valley. My boyfriend Bobby brings all of his vehicles here. Currently they have our Mustang GT and are installing a new engine and we know they will provide the best quality work as they always do. Honest. Reliable. Fast and the staff is always A+. So if you ever need anything done the right way, with the best prices on your vehicles just use Chuy.< /text>

<username>Monique Peñaflor<//username><Date>1608305256520</Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>This place is the absolute best. It does help if you show up first thing in the morning because the shop does fill up fast. Or if you live very far away. Give them a call the day before and let them know you're coming in, the next morning. That helped me. The prices are affordable and the work quality is the best. If you ever have a problem. Chuy is an honest man that works hard on every car. He's a sweet man with a tough staff. So I wouldn't barge in there with a bad attitude. My husband and I have brought our vehicle's to him for 4 years. The shop as a whole has taken really good care of us everytime. I highly recommend this place to family and friends.<//text>< pics>

AMAZING SERVICE AT REASONABLE PRICES!!! I needed a flat tire changed quickly as I had a camping trip to get to before dark. American tire depot wanted to charge me about 1/2 as much as Tires 4 less did.<//review>

<Review>Honest, Competent, Helpful. Saved us bigtime.

we had a large problem with our car while on a road trip, and Chuy's fixed us up right away to ensure that we were safe to drive home 2000 miles away. fair pricing, extremely knowledgeable about issues, and was very reassuring in their fix - unlike the first shop we went to, that tried to convince us that we needed a full engine rebuild

don't go anywhere else for your mechanic needs in the area!< /Review>< Name>

<text>I have taken my vehicle to Chuy's several times over the last 3 years and when my inspection renual was due Feb 2016 they went above and beyond what I expected of them and didnt charge me extra... had to go back because a sensor was bad, one of two they said "we'll try the least expensive first and if that doesn't fix the exhaust issue we will replace the other". They even covered the way to reset the part by driving 15 miles at a steady 55 mph.  It worked and was able to pass the inspection.  I've taken my roommates car in when he was out of town and the radiator needed replacing. Great price and no issues in 2 years.  Ive referred 3 others to Chuy's and will continue to do so. In fact, am headed there this morning with engine light on and sluggish, jumpy acceleration-unable to get above 40 mph...<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Took a couple cars to get fixed, then took to another shop to get aligned and had to take back to Chuys because job was not done correctly. Alignment shop showed me how wrong the job was done and Chuys tried to play it off saying that is was done correctly. Had to lift vehicle myself after taking it to Chuys two times to get it "fixed" so I could get it aligned. Second vehicle took to him four times, this time he bought the parts and did the work without calling and letting me know how much it was going to be, still had to take back to him because he messed up on the work and had to have vehicle towed back to him after 1500 worth of repairs. Will not recommend not reliable. He charged 300 for a part that would have cost me 65 to get. Will never go back to this shop and will not recommend to anyone.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Whenever you're in a tight squeeze when it comes to getting a mechanic at short notice Chuy's Auto Repair is the best place. You can either have him take care of the whole car or just charge you for labor if you have your own part. I've been to this place several times and I recommend it.<//Text>

<Text>For 2 years i took my cars to Chuey's, and I recommended at least 10 people to them. They were fast and friendly and the work was decent.. I don't know what happened but all of a sudden everything went wrong, I took a 8 year old Nissan Maxima for new struts, and in return everything rattled loose the airconditioner was disconnected, parts were missing and wires from my alternator were hanging out of my tires..I spoke to the owner who's only remark was "that how it was" didn't even try to solve the issue, or offer to assess the problems caused by his shop..my opinion is they got busy and greedy and now we are cattle being moved along...next......Never again, they just lost a faithful customer.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>For simple thinhmga chuey is ok. He took on my volvo transmission, kept the car with various excuses, charged me 2000.00 to tell me they couldnt fix it.  I took it to Ontario volvo and it was fixed within a week.  Chuey is basicakly a guy who can watch YouTube and fix your car whike watching the video. People like him because hes inexpensive.  You get whzt you pay for!!!</Text>< user>

< Review>
Nowadays, it makes little sense to own my printers and maintain them in my home. I come to libraries to do work involving internet. The cost is reasonable $0.15 a page to print.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Staff are extremely friendly and helpful during the curb side pickup.
They also choose additional books for my daughters when I come to pickup my hold items

It is a great surprise for the kids to see additional books which they never put on hold.

Some of the books choose by the librarians are very good and we may never read those if they are not selected by them

Highly recommended. We use the library more frequently than before the pandemic.< /text>< pictures>

<text>While parking is tight, I am always looking forward to my Irvine library visits.  I thought just surfing the web covers the need, but even just the amount of magazines to scan makes trip an adventure. I even learned that the Consumer's Report magazine (in paper] has more detail then the online version. Who would thought.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN7Zg6veFM3EWbMoeOEtTUbZVXJeUvIqAVmere=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipON3BX58EgBUvlCflq9-J9kILxJlDJ-PGZdXXqo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcdcf754bb258b:0x776a6e6dd629a316<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>The Friends Of The Library Bookstore is fabulous for finding next to new books and videos for a great bargain. And the ladies that run it are So Sweet! As for the Heritage Library itself, it is a great resource. Has very helpful employees to help find what you need. However, when it comes to being a place to TRULY and properly study, it is ALWAYS Far From Quiet. There is always 2-5 tables full with tutors. And people talking in normal voices, answering phones, or children running a muck. It is the closest library for the current needs. Ultimately I prefer to go to the Mission Viejo City Library where they have study rooms with closed doors, and they keep it quiet.</Review>< pictures>

HORRIBLE. So my fiancé & i went to look for some books but the whole library system is unorganized. We tried searching on the computer they had available but couldn't figure out the way to find them. The books were all ripped up as well. We even asked one of the workers there but he rudely blurted out "Sorry don't know you have to go to the front desk." Really Heritage Library?! Really??!!< /Review>

<text>I really enjoy going to that library. I wouldn’t call it  quiet, but if you get to the tables in the front, you would be fine. Yes, it probably doesn’t have all the trending books, but there’s still a lot to choose from.</text>< Pics>

One of my favorite library in Irvine, you can find a lot of good used books from the "Friends of Library ", some only for 25 cents and if you spend 50cent to 1$, then you can some real good nooks, like Ken Folet's triology series and etc.  some special events may held in the square in front of the library, like this one to memorize the whistle blower "Wenliang Li", who just sacrificed in the "nova Cononavirus" epidemic in Wuhan, China, my hometown. As his alumni, we are proud of his bold to tell the truth in China., hope the honest people won‘t be punished in the mainland of China.< /Text>

all the spots to study are extremely vulnerable and the outlets don't even work. there are quiet areas but it's a small space, so the sound travels. Won't be coming back to this one.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>This is a big library located at convenient place in Irvine. There are many activities throughout the month in various languages, mainly English, Korean and Chinese. There's family movie time, pajama story times, toddler, baby, preschool storytimes and other language story times too. The collection of kids and adults books is huge.
Bonus is the view from the backdoor, as shown in a photo that I have uploaded. There are ducks in the pond, and there's also a play area nearby. There are other places like child resource center (CRC library) and fine arts center in the next block.
You are missing a lot if you reside in Irvine and don't make use of this.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Heritage has a unique charm as its a sweet little library surrounded by a lake,  playground and a fire station that seam like a guard tower to a magical kingdom.  The lake is where many go to just enjoy a nice picnic of walk amongst the natural scenery while the kids go to play but the library is my favorite area as the book selection is the best in southern California of like me,  you enjoy a good novel with deep characters that you feel you are traveling with throughout the story.  My most precious memories are sitting at the lake and reading a newly barrowed library book.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Its a nice library but this place is always crowded. Its hard to find a place to sit with a table. They have a lot of chairs. If you need a very quiet place to study this is not the place. It is full of kids and parents. I didn't mind too much but sometimes I couldn't do my work. This seems to be like a great place to bring your kids and the staff seem really nice and willing to help.<//text>

Staff is Rude so rude. I took my grandchildren this evening picking books. 15 mins before Closing they announced it over the intercom. Right after that someone from the staff started turning off and on the lights and wouldn't stop.
The library wasn't even packed . I felt bad for a child that was actually studying w a tutor. I went to check out w my grandchildren and a man started to burst out how annoying and rude the staff were for switching the lights off and on and  turning the music loud. I totally agreed. But my granddaughters  got scared by the guy outbusrt.
Hello, staff that's so unnecessary and unprofessional.< /Review>

It give you the impression of been onside a daycare center with loud children screaming moving books and throwing DVDs everywhere, the library stuff seems not to care neither the children's parent's. The librarians make too much noise with those book cars while working the book shells and while placing them in the little rolling cars, also don't seat near the front because the bipping  noise at the book checkout is almost as loud of that of a supermarket cashier's scanning machine, extremely loud, wouldn't allow you to concentrate on anything you are doing, i been to MacDonalds and Burger kings about 10 times more quiet less annoying and more pleasant then this so called library, sometimes i step outside in the patio because it become even more quiet and less loud than that of inside, this place does not qualify as a library or a place to bread....irony, as far as the staff they could care less. What about the temperature there or overall environment?... Well it's cold enough for you to bring a jacket from home even if it's nice outside because the atmosphere inside is very cold which is not good for concentration while trying to read or work on your laptop, their lights and illumination system is less invasive than other libraries so you won't have this to feel sorry about. What about their two patios? Avoid their patios, the walls are full of dust and their windows and even dust web in their outdoor lights and yellow dusty webs sticking from the ceiling and alls as well, they probably haven't heard of water pressure cleanup, which is supposed to be done ones a month or at least every other month while the library is closed, aboid getting sick avoid the patios.< /Text>< response>

< Review>
This is my first time here and it is awful.  There are kids running around and shouting loud and their parents obviously just don't care. I'm curious is this a library or a playground?<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>(Translated by Google) The staff are very friendly and helpful. It's an atmosphere that many kids find and study, so it can be a little fuss but it feels comfortable. We can do a lot of computer work and printing inexpensively and use habitually.

(Original)
직원들도 아주 친절하고 설명도 잘 해 주십니다. 어린이들이 많이 찾아서 공부를 하는 분위기라 조금 소란할 수는 있지만 편안하게 느껴집니다. 왠만한 컴퓨터 업무나 프린팅 작업도 저렴하게 할 수 있어서 애용하고 있습니다.</text>< Pics>

Kick to the mouth spice and flavor🌶️. The chili, spices and aroma occupy your senses as you chow down on the dishes here. Would definitely eat here on a cold day as the food will definitely warm you up. I would recommend ordering the toothpick lamb to share and maybe two orders as they go out pretty quick because of how tasty it is. It gets really busy towards the evening and they would seat people both inside and outside. The staff was friendly and will help you order if you haven't tried szechuan cuisine before.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>The closest you can get to real Sichuan plates, you don't need to travel far if you're from Orange County. The place is small but food is big in taste. Right now, it's mostly outside seating with tables arranged in the parking lot where a canopy protects customers from direct sunlight. Their specialties include deep fried pork intestines, kidneys, and chicken with peanuts. Being Sichuan, expect things to be on the hotter side. Highly recommended if you're into Sichuan food.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Dined in a few times pre-pandemic and was craving their Kung Pao Chicken yesterday so decided to try their delivery through DoorDash. We got their Kung Pao Chicken, Twice Cooked Pork, Boiled Fish with Rattan Pepper, and Wok Fried Kidney. Portion sizes were generous -- I didn't feel like the portion sizes were any less than when dining in. Flavors were excellent- food came hot! It came in a reusable tote bag.

The Kung Pao chicken was the best I've ever had, and I don't even usually like Kung Pao chicken! The fish is also one of my favorites-- the rattan pepper makes it special and there is nothing they can do to make it better. Twice cooked pork lost a little bit of caramelization in the plastic box but still tasty. The kidneys were perfectly done. The portions lasted me through a few meals afterwards.

I would order from them again!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
My family went to this "Sichuan" impression today. Very disappointed. It is far from authentic Sichuan flavor. It is also far worse than last time I tried 2 years ago.
My family enjoy Sichuan style for decades. We go Sichuan restaurant at least once per 2 weeks. I know what is authentic what is fake.<//Review>

<Text>Ordered the Kung Pao chicken, dry fried spicy chicken and wontons in chili oil.  All were tasty but very disappointed that rice is not included with any entree.  For $19, the dry fried chicken was overpriced and I will likely not order that again.  Flavor was good on all dishes and presented in a nice reusable to-go bag.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dcdbec241a8ca3:0xe0a3bb61569b7cbb</gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBJ6pycNAbSn2KGph0Ws0paM8a4lzyHM1bNa-N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBMLwVJ-M-gOiaR6QNatnr6c9fVApOq3AJU_kf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzXGsodzR7QWOabdHEHXIkKrQb588E-_CW8DNb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><date>1598830325577</date><name>Dana Sohovich< /name><user>103804178455863873904<//user><rate>3</rate><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Review>Extremely unprofessional because the lady flat out asked for higher “Tip”.
According to her the tip amount was not sufficient.

Well for serving delayed and wrong drinks, delayed rice what we had tipped was already more.

The lady mentioned that they get questioned by the “owners” if they bring in less tips.
If she is right, the owners need to learn customer service first before trying to scrutinize their employees.

If she lied to us to get more tips, she need to be let go immediately.
Oh, she also had a huge attitude.

If you want to negotiate tips, definitely goto this place.
If you don’t like being harassed for the tips then avoid this place at all cost.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I love everything about this place because the food and service are good.  Although they do not let people sit inside the restaurant, they do have outside seatings. My husband doesn't like the taste of Szechuan very much but he loves this restaurant because the taste of Szechuan pepper is not as strong as other places. We will be back to try other dishes.</review>< Pictures>

This place turned me into the human version of the "Face Savouring Delicious Food" (yes, that's what it's officially called). The spicy fish.. yum! The wontons... double yum! The spicy chicken... numbingly yum!! The only downside is few veggie options.<//Text>

I WILL NEVER COME! I ordered a pickup from fantuan at 17:12, the app showed it would be ready at 17:42. When I came in the store in 17:55, none of the food are ready for pickup. The service told me they haven’t start making them, need at least 30min. I don’t understand what dishes require more than 1hr to pick up when the restaurant is quite empty inside.< /Review>

Favorite chienese restaurant for spicy sichuan cuisine. I usually get the noodle dishes, steamed chicken in chili and cold dishes like husband wife mix side dish. Anything with sichuan peppercorns is delicious. Wontons in chili sauce and mapo tofu is tasty too.<//Text>

Best freaking Sichuan food I've ever had. Hot, damn. I wanna go back and I went here yesterday lol. The food is indescribable and I really just recommend you come here and try yourself. My mouth is watering just thinking a out it. I ordered Mama's shredded noodles ( the soup looking one), bean jelly noodles, and cold chicken although it's called steamed chicken...it's cold lol but still hella good ( more warm than cold actually). It may look spicy but wasn't spicy at all</text>

<Text>I absolutely love here!  I like spicy food ! I had been here over 10 times . Don’t going to the rushing time it’s gonna take 30-60mins.   They’re not accepting appt. you should go there take a number  wait for calling. (Unless not rushing time) service is good if you like spicy food here is your place.</Text>< pictures>

Very tasty (with a little kick) Szechuan Chinese restaurant (or Sichuan whatever is your preference!) Visited there several times. The spicy fish and toothpick mutton/lamb dish gets ordered every time I’ve been there. This time also got the mapo tofu.<//Text>

Their lamb on toothpicks here are quite good but it is a matter of luck at times. Sometimes there are nice and tender (soft meat) while other times one can be like “what did they send me..?”. Their fried Taiwan Vegetables are also good (A-Tsai). Not a bad place if chef is doing his job properly. One thing I am not too fond of is their rice. They use low quality rice here. Tony is a very very nice and friendly waiter here. I think this place can be much better if waiters relayed customer requests to chefs in kitchen instead of just writing it down then order would be more likely followed up on. As an example, I love their lamb on toothpicks but sometime they come out perfect when you tell them that you don’t want them to be too spicy and other times they arrive so spicy that you can’t even eat them. This is not an issue for those that love very very spicy food but to those trying to eat a little spicy food may be a big issue. If the waiter takes the order then just drops off the paper at the drop off window then there is a 90% chance your request for order to be less spicy will come out as spicy as everyone else’s order but if he goes back to tell chef then you have a 40-50% chance of it coming out spicy. If they offered better quality rice,vegetables,lamb and followed cooking orders I would give them 5 stars.</Review>

Great selections of authentic Sichuan dishes. We ordered lamb casserole, fiery kidney, Mapo Tofu and boil fish fillet in chili sauce. They were all very delicious. Service is great and very nice decor. Will try different dishes next time.</Review>

The cold sliced beef was also disappointing because the meat was full of tendons and tough to chew. Without the seasoning it would’ve felt like chewing rubber.<//Review><rate>3< /rate>< GmapID>

We stopped by for dinner during a road trip.  This place has absolutely delicious and authentic Sichuan cuisine.  And our server Kelvin was attentive and recommended some really tasty dishes.  Our favorite is the stir fried pork ribs.  Would definitely come back again when we are in the area.</text>

<Review>If you like spicy food this place is great. The dishes are unique, full of flavor and spice. Tonight I tried the Home-Style Fried Rice and Griddle Cooked Shrimp. The rice was great some of the best I have had just enough of Sichuan Impressions fresh spicy flavor. The shrimp was great, the celery, peppers and garlic was excellent, but if you don't like whole shrimp legs and all this might not be for you, it also super spicy :).</Review>< Pics>

<Review>This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant whose dishes have very tasty flavors and great aroma. We ordered the pig ear, beef pancake, and chicken with chili and pepper. The food tends to lean towards the spicy side though so if you can't handle the spice then try to stick with the non chili dishes</Review>< username>

I had to wait for my food. I had the ribs with dry chilli and Serrano. The wait was worth it it was hot and spicy. I like the service, parking is accessible. The rose tea was delicious 👌. Will return again. 😄</review>

< Review>
Great place is your hankering for Szechuan cuisine. If you can't handle the high amount of spice in normal Szechuan dishes, this is a good place to try. If you want more intense flavors, Chengdu Taste in Alhambra is where it's at.

Stir fried pig intestines, impressive sausages, cold chili oil chicken, wontons in red chili oil, and boiled fish in rattan pepper are awesome dishes that you should try.

The impressive noodles are okay. It's not a good replacement for dan dan mien, but if you're craving noodles it's as close as your gonna get. There's a decent amount of spice and sauce.

I don't recommend the mapo tofu. It's very light on meat and a little too watery for my taste. It doesn't have that addictive flavor that makes you craving for more like I'm used to from Chengdu Taste.< /Review>

There were so many items on the menu that I wanted to try! Everything sounded so good! I ended up getting wok fried ducks tongue and vegetable on the side
Got me thinking, is duck tongue really this tiny? If so, how many ducks were sacrificed to make this yummy dish with celery??!!
good customer service, quick food service, and cleanliness!
I would def come back with a bigger party so I can order more dishes!!!</Review></record>

Not a recommend restaurant during this pandemic time.

I know this is tough time but they made it tougher. People waiting in line exposed here although most customer already ordered online, including pregnant women.

AND some customers are backdoored to be able to skip the long line because they know the worker here.

Don’t want give shade to the worker here bc they are super busy and tried their best. With that being said, the manger is absolutely trash. There is no f managing at all.

It is a mess, don’t waste your time ordering food here, as least for now.<//Review>

<Text>Very good Sichuan Restaraunt in Irvine area. Decor is simple and clean. Service is excellent, waitress was funny N provided great suggestions.

The appetizer juicy steamed chicken was soft, tender and very flavorful. The big mouth ginger frog was so spicy and so good. Mr. And Mrs. smith has very good combination of beef slices and beef tendon. The cold noodle plate was not very impressive because they made bit too hard to chew but flavor was still very good.
Wok-fried kidney with rattan pepper cleaned up very good, fresh and tender, this dish is definitely highly recommended for people who likes northern chinese food.
It's a restaurant I wouldn't mind coming back again.
Good job!</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I'm used to Tasty Zone in Costa Mesa, which I love. Came here to get similar dishes like cumin lamb and Mapo Tofu, plus some others.  Honestly, it was more expensive but not as good as I was used to. Service wasn't very good, and the food came out very slow and far apart. I probably won't be back - not because the food wasn't good, but just because I know I can get better< /text>< name>

<review>Awful service. Sat at table for 15 minutes, no hello, no water nothing. Rang bell and was told by waiter would be right beck. Then he helps others who came after us so we got up and left. Many of my coworkers come here for lunch and I will for sure tell them about this experience.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Come with a big group or else it'd be hard to try all their wonderful dishes. The wait should not be too long since the place is big but on popular holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas), it takes around an hour to be seated.</Text><time>1518210047561</time>< Gmap_id>

Love that spicy food!  Crazy long wait lines, but yelp app lets you know how long the lines are.  Fancy inside compared to the outside.  Wish they had more servers, their.only weakness.<//text>

Melt your face off in the most pleasurable way possible. Order the spicy pot soup. It has the most intense layers of flavor and is enough food to share with a pal.

Don't get the bobo chicken! Not enough food or punch for the price.<//Text>

Hands down the most authentic Chinese restaurant you can find in Orange County that is also high quality. I cannot think of another restaurant in all of Socal where they serve frog, pork trotters, kidneys and intestines, and mutton lamb meat, all in one menu. Love the "3 chili" spiced shrimp but there are literally dozens of menu items here that are must trys. Protip: Friday and Saturday evenings show up before 5pm. After 5:15, expect a 30 minute wait.</Text>

The photos on the menu are not very accurate. The pork ribs were not spicy at all despite the fact that the photo made them look. The portion was also very small. For two people ordering 4 dishes would be good.</Review>< time>

<review>I loved this place at first smell! The flavor of what i had was fantastic, I like to try the most simple dishes dirst, Mama's noodles with a little spicey oil is soooo good. I have no doubt the rest of the items would be equally fantastic. Not sure about the music ;) It's transcendent.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Yummy food but the hostess? was cold and rude. FYI we noticed after that there's a sign advertising buy 2 get one free of either Stella or shocktop I believe. Everything is more spicy than we expected! At first we thought we could handle it but by the end of the night we were dying. Mutton toothpicks and the rattan pepper soup are great! I would pass on the cold noodles (the one we ordered was not what we expected). Mabo tofu is nice too but very spicy (duh!). Street fries are alright. They are sauteed instead of deep fried. Noodles and fries are good to help soak up the spice.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><userid>108744829658176916713< /userid>< Resp>

I’m a huge fan of Sichuan food and dry pot. We really like the kung pho chicken, dry pot, cold noodles, and the ma pao tofu. We always debate on adding new dishes or sticking to the ones we love. We can only eat so much in one sitting. Definitely one of my fave Sichuan spots in OC!< /text>

We sat and waited for a waiter after pressing the useless button a couple times. People i walked in with were already recieving food while we havent even ordered a drink! Food came out late but was okay, had too many PEANUTS, i had better but im not gna be petty! Customer service is a big anchor in getting folks to come back, if u cant act fast or even tend to ur customers needs, why look for tips, because we gave a TIP even though u guys didnt deserve it. Mabe we werent ASIAN enuff or we didnt look like folks who dont ever eat here, but service is service and yall need to get it right for ur future guests!< /review>< user_name>

<Review>I found this place to be very clean and nicely laid out with nice ambiance.

We had the cold lamb noodles which were delicious. Great amount of spice and flavor in this dish and loved the firm texture of the noodles.

The signature ribs were very good and left our mouths numb.

The cold pickled cucumbers were just ok. I really did not feel that the addition of szechuan spices to these traditional Chinese pickles went well together.

Lamb cumin on toothpicks was good, but not sure if I would order again. Very strong cumin flavor.

Fried chicken was awesome, however we would prefer the boneless chicken version. NIce amount of spice and a great flavor

Spicy potatoes were crinkle cut fries that were flash cooked so its mostly raw. Intersting, and pretty good. Really numbs the mouth, but I doubt if we will order again.

Looking forward to trying other items.

A bit pricey. All those items I listed plus 2 beers was over a hundred dollars. Their main competition is Chong Qing Mei Wei Szechuan Restaurant in Irvine which I feel may be more authentic and less pricey. Regardless, I am glad this place is here in Tustin to give us choices< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcdbec241a8ca3:0xe0a3bb61569b7cbb<//gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) Very authentic Sichuan restaurant ~ some dishes are still spicy enough! 31 per capita is not bad ~ 5: There are already many people at the door, so be prepared to line up for your meal.

(Original)
很正宗的川菜馆～有些菜还是够辣的！人均31还不错～5: 开门门口已经很多人啦，饭点做好排队的准备哦。<//review>

(Translated by Google) I have eaten many times, and today I have to vomit once.
Let's talk about the price first. Chengdu can be 10-15% more expensive than the taste of the same dishes. I still choose here because I like the taste of the dishes.
But the service is really bad. The service is always about serving drinks, serving dishes, and asking you to sign a tip. You need to always ask for the service. Every time you choose 20% of the tip, it is not because of the service, but because you like the taste. Once last month, I went to eat with my daughter-in-law. As soon as I sat down and the daughter-in-law ordered the meal, I heard two service staff chatting, saying that our table seemed to be ironed and not tipped. I was more angry and gave a 15% tip.
Today’s hot weather, I drove to the restaurant for more than ten minutes. My wife asked me to order the meal and pick it up. When I arrived at the restaurant, she gave the bank card to the service staff. The service staff asked me to sign a tip of 15%, 20%, and 25%. Asked, do I need to tip for delivery? The service staff answered that they would give it normally! I asked if it would work if I didn't give it. The service staff answered, whatever. He looked unhappy.
I can't enjoy any service, but I have to tip the service staff every time they feel they deserve it. The service staff here are really big names.

去吃过很多次，今天不得不吐槽一次。
先说价格，跟同样菜品的滋味成都，能贵百分之10到15.依然选择这里，是因为喜欢这里菜品的味道。
但是服务真是糟糕，服务永远都是上饮料，上菜，让你签小费，需要服务永远都的主动叫，每次选择百分之20小费不是因为服务，而是因为喜欢这里的味道。上个月有一次，我跟我的媳妇去吃，刚进入坐下，媳妇点完餐，就听到两个服务人员在聊天，说我们这桌像要打铁，不给小费的，那次媳妇比较生气给啦百分之15的小费。
今天天气燥热，家里开车到餐馆十几分钟，媳妇让我点好餐后去取，到啦餐馆，把银行卡给服务人员，服务人员，又让我签15% 20%25%的小费，我问到，取外送也需要给小费么，服务人员回答，正常都给！我问到，不给行不行。服务人员回答，随便。一脸不乐意的样子。
享受不到任何服务，却要每次付出服务人员觉得理所应得的小费，这里的服务人员真是有点大牌啊。</review>

(Translated by Google) The taste of the dishes is okay, the price is low, and more than six people must pay an 18% tip. . . The service is really bad, there is no smile, cold, two male waiters make people uncomfortable, one female waiter does not provide any service except for request. Compared with other Chinese food, the service is still far behind.

(Original)
菜品味道还可以，价格小贵，六人以上必须支付18%小费。。。服务真的不咋地，一点笑脸没有，冷冰冰，两个男服务生让人不太舒服，一个女服务生除了提要求，其他没有任何服务。和其他中餐比服务还是差远了。</text>

Not integrated, very disappointed. Unfortunately, I should not take my friends again.

菜品不如之前新鲜了，点的猪排、猪肉，口感上感觉存放了太久时间（因为我们是当天一开门就光顾的，推测预处理的猪排、猪肉隔夜了），所以有串味，配菜味道也没有融合进去，很失望。很遗憾，应该不会再带朋友去了。< /Text><UserId.>114307251784855447184<//UserId.>< date>

(Translated by Google) Food tastes ok, I like to eat here frequently at first, until I find out every time I eat here and end up get food poisoning badly. it get me seriously bad stomach pain, that takes couple of days to recover from it. Of the waitresses is generally nice, but they hired some new ones that can be really rude. The taste of this restaurant is ok. But every time I go home, I feel colic, and I found it several times. I don't know what is causing food poisoning. Friends who love Sichuan food are careful. Coupled with long queues to find the location, the waiter's attitude is still very poor. Really worth it.

Plus most of the waitresses is generally nice, but they hired的some new ones that can be really rude. 这家餐厅，味道算是还ok. 但是每次吃完回家肚子就绞痛，中了好几次才发现。不知道是里面什么东西造成食物中毒。爱吃川菜的朋友小心。再加上好多时候排着长队才找到位置，服务员的态度还极差。真的很不值。< /Text>

(Translated by Google) 1. dining environment 0 point!

Long waiting line!
They have the WORST waiting system.
just like other places, you will write down names and wait.
but somehow, there are always some people can cut the line to be in front of you. it's more than 2 times i saw customer argue with them because of the waiting line problem.

No spaces between tables! again!
this part i will give exactly same review i post for chengdu taste.
That's just about the length of a pencil. plus Chinese people just like to talk loud in public, I feel like im in a overcrowded schools cafeteria!!!
POOR Dining Environment!

Rude waiters!
waiter here are a lot better than "chengdu taste", however, still not qualified. Putting Customers Last. Attitude....

Table and tableware
much better than "chengdu taste" but still not too clean.... :(

The dining environment is very bad, zero points!
The queuing system is very strange, people will jump in front of you constantly. Obviously no one came when they called.
Later, you can jump in the queue again? Isn't it amazing? And more than once. I have seen a couple of times because of this, customers and shop assistants quarreled. One of them. Several shop assistants were still good. It was a perfect match, but it seemed that the manager’s pair of taller-bodied women would just roll if you didn’t eat. Attitude... dumbfounded....

The distance between the tables is very close
Basically, the whole meal is also in a noisy environment...The queue people will also stare at you for dinner...Anyway, I am not very comfortable eating.

Waiter service is average
To be honest, the attitude is much better than the taste of the Chengdu Luolangang store. But although it does not show a bad face, it is not much better. Only once a tall male waiter smiles. Others look like I'm very busy and don't bother me ...And those who are queuing up, let's not say...

Table and tableware
The dining table and tableware are relatively clean compared to the Chinese restaurant, but occasionally the table is still not clean.

2. food
some of food are great, but some are too salty.
the dish/potion are very small/little.
the other location (Alhambra) have much better taste.
Some dishes are too small, such as jelly... Some dishes taste good, some dishes are too salty, the next time you update the picture. But overall it is not as good as Alhambra’s

3. Value for money
fair price
parity

用餐环境 非常糟糕 零分！
排队系统很奇怪, 不停有人会插队到你前面. 明明刚才他们叫人时候没人来,
后来来了又可以插队？ 很神奇吧？而且不止一次. 我见过好几次因为这样客人和店员吵起来. 其中有一次. 有几个店员还是不错. 打打圆场, 但是好像总管的那个比身材比较高的女的一副你不吃就滚的态度... 看的傻眼....

餐桌间距离 非常近
基本全程也是吵闹环境中用餐....排队人也会盯着你吃饭...反正我是吃不太舒服.

服务员服务一般
说实话态度比滋味成都 罗兰岗店要好很多了. 但是虽然不摆臭脸 但是好不到哪去. 只有一次一个高个男服务员是笑脸. 其他人一副很烦 我很忙 别跟我烦的样子...还有排队吵架的就不说了...

餐桌和餐具
餐桌 和 餐具 相对中餐厅算干净了, 但偶尔桌子还是油油的没搽干净.

2. food
some of food are great, but some are too salty.
the dish/potion are very small/little.
the other location (Alhambra) have much better taste.
有的菜量太少 比如凉粉...有的菜味道不错, 一些菜太咸了, 下次update图片. 但是总体来说不如 Alhambra 那家的好吃

(Translated by Google) The steamed pork sandwiched the hair, just retired, the service staff did not have any sorry. At the peak of the evening meal, the rice bowl is not asked when you finish eating. Defiant service, poor chef, a table of good food, but it is difficult to swallow.

(Original)
粉蒸肉中间夹着头发，只是退菜，服务人员没有任何抱歉的意思。 晚上高峰期用餐，快吃完的时候撤饭碗也不加询问。蔑视型服务，可怜厨师一桌好菜我却难以下咽。</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>These guys seriously rock. I bought a new pair of wipers and for some reason, even though the wiper model was right, they didn't fit my car when I tried to install it. Even though I couldn't find my receipt, they were able to not only look me up in the system, but they swapped me out for a better set and came out to the parking lot to install them. Totally impressed, I recommend this store to anyone.</Text>< time>

This use to be one of the closest auto parts store I lived buy and was my main parts store, but staff after staff the store got worse so I moved along as well. But shopping here for quick parts like glue or wiper blades will do.< /Text>

<Text>I came in with my mechanic and upon checking up on the items I asked for a military discount, showed my veteran ID, the employee had to get the female manager with glasses for the password and muttered *he doesn't look like it* right in front on me. C'mon really...

Lol I was mad but it was funny

This is one of the best O'Reilly Auto Parts!  They probably have what you want at the best price, and if they don't they'll order it quickly!  Clean, handicap accessible, excellent friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Lots of parking for free!</review>

<review>We arrived there late (around 9:00 pm) my wife's battery was lifeless. They had a battery in stock, installed it and we were on our way. I don't know if they normally do that especially with it being so late we were blessed that they took care of us. I rate the customer service  excellent!</review>< Pics>

They tried to charge me near double for oil then price matched when i said i can get it elsewhere way less and showed them on my phone. Staff was eating at the front and just seemed unhappy to be there. Due to price match and how he handled it i bumped it to 2 from 1<//Text>

<text>Worse car parts buying experience ever. Went in for 3 parts and got all wrong parts. Good thing I checked the parts cause every part that he brought up was wrong. I wanted the better quality parts but the worker never offered me any options and automatically tought I wanted the cheapest. Even after to told him I wanted the better part with longer warranty, the worker still claimed that he got the right part. When my parts guy took 10 mins to find me the wrong parts, I asked the manager to look up a air filter for me. Gave me an attitude and said "wasn't he helping you?" I was the only costumer at the counter with 2 other workers not doing anything btw. Never going here ever again< /text><gmapID>0x809ad1b308c043b7:0x2b24e523b51a355b<//gmapID>< response>

Stopped there on very hot afternoon on way back from viewing eclipse in central Oregon.  Very nice vibe about the place.  Has a historic drinking fountain built by the CCC that was moved from its original location on Buckhorn Pass on 299 during one of that highways improvement cycles.  Has a nice educational display about the fountain and its moving.<//Text>

<review>There’s no better way to relax!  The rooms are immaculate and plush with the best views in the valley.  The ability to order meals in-house along with the comforts of a hot tub and massive pool makes this an awesome resort.  Always my personal favorite.</review>< Pics>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>The lobby seem to be in order and clean also they are practicing safe covid. My sister and I shared a room. They had a coffee machine with no cups no sugar no nothing just a coffee machine and we had to call downstairs to get the stuff delivered to the room. They said there was inside dining at their restaurant. So we went upstairs got dressed and went downstairs for dining. There was no inside dining for dinner. There is inside dining for breakfast. So we ordered our food 2 take to our room. I had the fish and chips my sister had the hamburger. She said the hamburger was good the french fries were good but my fish on the other hand was horrible. The fish was way over cooked and Soggy inside that was a wasted $13 yes they charge as much as a restaurant does for food that is only rated at the low end. While we were getting dressed one of the workers opened our room door and embarrassed my sister very badly. The bathroom door is made of glass that you can see through and it did not close when you're sitting on the toilet the door will open up it did not lock that was embarrassing for me. I will never go here again. All they are interested in is taking your money. And did I mention the hotel room windows were so dirty you can hardly see out of them. And the whole night long you can hear the sound of running water. I did not have a good night sleep.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Everything was excellent with our stay.
Only recommendation is to have shampoo, conditioner and shower gel in the tub. We only had body lotion and soap. I don't know who uses lotion in the shower and don't know anyone not wanting shampoo and conditioner.< /Review>

<review>I have great regards for Crown Plaza's all over. I have been in Santiago de Chile and I loved it! Here I had the worst experience. I was greeted and informed of all amentities in the hotel. I also was upgraded to bigger room, which I was amazed of the back court view. Then I had a problem.

I took a shower and the shower backed filled the tub as I took the shower. I said no big deal something a 5 min clean could fix. I called and requested for someone to look at it, it was Saturday Morning. I left to Salnas California then return Sunday night wanted to take a shower. No service tech came over they said they didn't know why no one came over but would request another service ticket for Monday. Monday arrived and nothing was done, AGAIN! I called Monday afternoon and demanded to talk to the manager. Luis said, "I will ask the manager to call you tomorrow". She never called. Which I am not surprised.

I told him I need this fixed today or change my room. I refuse to stay here any longer. He said we did upgrade you. Yes to a non working shower that's not an upgrade it is a downgrade. He called a service person which fixed my tub in 2 minutes. It took 3 calls and a angry customer to get something fixed! I will no longer be staying there.<//review><Name>EddieB<//Name><UserId.>None<//UserId.>< rate>

Constantly very loud in room - maybe we were next to a utility room or something. Paid extra for breakfast to be included. Breakfast is available for only 2 hours and options are incredibly limited (0 vegan options).

There is a waste can out in the center parking lot that had not been emptied in some time, there was trash all around it. I'm sure it's a skeleton crew, but this was during the week, pretty elementary stuff.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>We had an amazing wedding night stay at the Crowne Plaza Palo Alto. Our only regret was not staying longer. We will be back for a longer visit for sure. The room was big and beautiful and very clean. We loved our deck and all of the light in the room. It exceeded our expectations.< /Review>< pictures>

My stay was wonderful! The hotel room was bright and clean and I loved having the poolside access. My daughter and I really enjoyed sunbathing by the pool only a few steps away from our room. We also enjoyed having the patio chairs and table for morning coffee and sunshine!< /Text>

Room was wonderful (we stayed in a suite) and the pool was great.  Staff was a ghost town.  I could never get ahold of the restaurant when trying to call multiple times over the course of 3 days; also never could get ahold of guest services.  I had to walk downstairs to the front desk whenever I needed something. Despite that, we had a great stay.</text>

<review>I stay there often because they have amenities like a pool and dining upon arrival I was informed that there was no room service or restaurant available and the pool was closed. They also cleaned my room the first night and then never came back the next three days. When I called down to ask why they said due to Covid however that would’ve been nice information to have upon check-in. There is an $18 a night parking fee which is outrageous. They had minimal snacks and beverages available. I literally walked down the street to another hotel that had a restaurant with seating outside and people were enjoying their pool. The Crowne Plaza has plenty of space and should be able to accommodate outdoor dining but it seems they’re not interested in providing the services I will not stay here again.</review><Rate>None</Rate>< GmapID>

This hotel was sub par to be nice.  The reception/lobby area is very nice. Hotel check-in staff very nice and accommodating.  The pool area from what I saw looked very nice.  The room(s) however were terrible.... run down, out dated, small and dark.  The room I reserved was not what I was given.  The pictures and description on the web are not anywhere close to what is reality.I moved to 3 different rooms before I called the front desk and told them I could not stay here ... I have never done that before.The only redeeming quality was the front desk staff.  Very curtious and understanding. They were very accommodating in cancelling my reservation.</Review>

<Review>The hotel was minimally occupied and we were given a poor corner room.  We asked for a upgrade being a IHG member and were not given one.  The room was in poor shape with duct tape showing below the TV stand and mix matched furnishings in the room.  Completely disappointed with the stay.  Window would not open and maintenance was called but did not respond until we were leaving.  Totally unacceptable.< /Review>< Response>

The ambiance at this hotel is always remarkable, elegant yet comfortable.  This hotel serves as a venue not just for conferences and trainings, but also for special events such as anniversaries.  The details of the interior and amenities in guest rooms are outstanding.  This hotel houses an intriguing art collection of colorful, modern California  labdscapes.  One of the  hotel’s legends is that the Beetles once stayed on the 8th floor, a guest suite.  The food is typically memorable and suits most palletes.  The staff aim to please.<//Review>

< Review>
The Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto was a wonderful place to stay.  My husband had surgery at Stanford so we chose the hotel based on proximity to the hospital.  They offer a discounted rate if you are at Stanford hospital (call ahead and let them know), the restaurant is very good, breakfast buffet is awesome and the room service is excellent.  We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel and very comfortable bedding for restful sleep after the hospital stay.  The entire staff was friendly and extremely helpful and kind.  They even had a wheelchair for our use as it was too far for my husband to walk after being discharged.  They are also ideally located for anything you might need - pharmacy, restaurants, etc.  I highly recommend them!</Review>

Room was nice and clean. They have new beds that were comfortable. Lavazza 😋coffee in the room and aromatherapy cream and spray to rest and relax. Shower robe and plenty of towels. The soaps that they provide weren't that great. They have a beauty mirror that's awesome! They allow pets under 25 lbs. With this said my room was clean.</review>

<Time>1583193600000</Time><Rating>None<//Rating><text>I choose this hotel of its vicinity to Stanford University. We attended Family Week at Stanford and it made travelling to all the events easy to attend. We checked in late Friday afternoon and our room was available in the 8th floor as per my preference. A staff member knocked on our door and offered us bottled water and candy for IHG members. The room accommodations was comfortable  and spacious. We ate the breakfast buffet on Saturday and Sunday. A lot of items to choose from that will satisfy your appetite. Our server (Christina) was very attentive to our needs! Checking out was simple and the bill was accurate. Would definitely stay at this Crown Plaza when we attend another event at Stanford University in the future.<//text>< Pics>

This was our first stay at this property. We arrived late in the day as a stop over on a road trip. Staff was very attentive and pleasant. Property was clean and well maintained. Room was very pleasant and we enjoyed a good rest. We had a late dinner in the lounge and it was very good. We enjoyed a very good breakfast in the dining area and the service was very good. We would definitely consider staying here again.</review>

<Text>The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was luxurious and the water temp was perfect. The bed was so comfy and the room temperature controls were easy to change according to personal preferences. The room service was very accommodating and there were always cute little condiments included with the delicious food. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and the breakfast manager went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met. The pool was quiet and comfortable with towels fully stocked at all times. The pool closes at 9pm which is the only disappointing thing about this hotel.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I truly enjoyed my 2 day stay here at Crowne Plaza. I highly recommend. Everyone was so friendly from the time I picked up the phone to make my reservation, arrived at hotel, and left. Amazing warm staff, who are always smiling and there if you need anything. The hotel is in a great location here in the Bay area.  Thank you Everyone!< /text>

The room was decent with a lot of space, but could use an upgrade. There were some spots on the rug and the chair in the living room area wasn't clean. I had to clean out the jacuzzi in the bathroom before using it. The grounds by the pool were filthy.<//Text>

<Review>Just a few list items.
Parking is a pain for oversized vehicles. They wanted to charge me for 6 spots for my truck and trailer because they didn’t have any kind of oversized parking. Got it resolved well enough. 
All doors for the three rooms we had looked like either a crow bar was used on them at one point or some sort of lock was removed. Looked bad. 
Could hear the parking lot through the door. Wasn’t awful but mentionable. 
Front desk needs to  communicate between shifts better. Was a small incident but resolved well.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Nice place to stay.  Our room was nice.  Xmas decorations were great.  Staff was friendly and helpful. They brought us a microwave to heat up some food along with some extra towel.  They also switched our room to one with double beds so we didn't have to use a cot.  Hot tub was great but the pool was really cold.  I guess it's  a good way to start your heart.  Breakfast staff was really helpful, food was good, but a little pricey. They served a smorgasbord style breakfast along with stuff from the menu.  Restrauant was spacious and clean.  Exercise room was nice.  We enjoyed the sauna also.  Available park was a little scarce.   I'd stay again for sure.< /Text><Date>1576531075653< /Date>< UserId.>

This property is conveniently located, and the property is well kept. My upgrade to a suite was unexpected and very nice. A big balcony to enjoy morning coffee, and a suite that is bigger than my condo!
All the staff/team were very nice.< /Text>

This hotel has many amenities: a hot tub, great meeting and event facilities, a business center, work out facility, fantastic food and outstanding service.  The rooms are very comfortable and somewhat luxurious but nonetheless are small.  The decor in this hotel is impeccable from an artistic point of view.  My only complaint is a loud  and constant electrical  buzzing noise that is not uncommon amongst hotels these days.  It keeps me awake and might be able to be remedied by adding more solar power to this gem of a hotel.  I am a guest here often.  I would like to hold a t raining conference here sometime, but have not yet done that.<//Text>

The hotel is very clean and safe with comfortable beds. My husband was having surgery that was changed last minute and we needed a place close to hospital. Unfortunately hotels during the week are extremely expensive. The front desk staff helped us get the best price they could. Beth was so helpful. She made us feel as she really cared.  The food in the restaurant was not very good (dinner) but breakfast buffet was great.< /Text>

I found the staff at this IHG/Crowne Plaza Hotel exceptional. From the front desk, restaurant/bar wait staff, housekeeping and maintenance.....everyone was extremely polite and courteous. For example, if a staff member was toting laundry to another location and saw that a guest was on the elevator, the staff wouldn't board. I've been to other hotels where staff viewed their task more important than the comfort of a guest. I saw a number of times, staff wiping down walls and thoroughly cleaning the elevators and common areas. It seems to me that either someone is doing a very good job of recruiting the right people or the staff are trained very well.<//review>

This is one of nicer hotels in the area. However, it is pretty dated, and sometimes windows are hard to open and some equipment (lights, jacuzzi) did not work. Also staff is kind of more talking than doing - they might be sorry for some issue, but now doing much to accommodate it.
In-room breakfast could be better as well - bread is kind of stale, juice is maybe(?) fresh squeezed. Beds are awesome.<//Review>

Great location hotel. Actually has a bit of history to it. You'll see signs saying the Beetles stayed on the 8th floor or the TCP protocol was hashed out in one of the conference rooms there etc. The hotel and grounds are bit nicer relative to the quality of the rooms but overall definitely comfortable stay. The pool and hot tub were great to use< /review>

Classy Old School feel with charming courteous staff but with minor indications of deferred maintenance, possibly attributable to the pandemic.</review>

Not the newest kid on the block but nice bones and still very nice.  Great decor.  Super people.  Nicely decorated for the Holidays.  Rooms a bit older but well kept.  We loved the Cabana room we had and the bathroom was nicely laid out.  Great location too.

Enjoyed out stay!</Text>

The staff shared some neat stories. The view from the room of so many beautiful trees in Palo Alto was peaceful.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>It is a lovely hotel and it's location is great. You have easy access to the highway and plenty of markets and restaurants around the area. Staff is friendly and rooms are very clean and cozy. 
But don't bother to use the valet it is not the greatest, better off parking yourself.
Not sure if it was just the day we stayed but we did not get to sleep past 7 am due to housekeeping in our hallways making loud noise you would of thought there was construction going on.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The rooms are very nice and the beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms are also in good condition. The air conditioning system was a bit noisy and the room (on ground floor) seemed to be a bit cold during the winter, there were no extra blankets.
Excellent breakfast, and the staff was very helpful.</Review>

I gave the value as 4/5 relative to prices to rooms in the area but overall the prices in Palo Alto are ridiculous< /Text></record>

I had a 2 day stay at Crowne Plaza and it was a relaxing atmosphere there. The Room Service was excellent and regular was being done and my belongings were kept tidy and Important Documents were untouched during the cleaning . 

Also while checkout i requested for my baggage to be held for 3 hours and it was immediately taken care of without any extra payment .</Text>

Stayed at the Crowne Plaza to watch my granddaughter compete in the Stanford Womens Golf Tournament. The hotel was in close vicinity of the competition. Our accommodation was excellent. Our room was not ready at check-in so the hotel upgraded our room . The room was roomy and the beds were very comfortable. The room can with breakfast and free parking. The breakfast buffet was excellent with good variety to select from. I would have like to have late checkout during my stay!<//Review>

<Review>I liked this facility, particularly the variety of spaces on the first floor for reading/working. The bed was great. The pool was big enough for several groups to use it at once. The food was good overall—the service top-notch. The room had only one very small window. The bar tender had never heard of a Tom Collins before and, not surprisingly didn't make a very good one. We had eight drinks between the two of us over our three-night stay. Three of them were really good. The other five were truly mediocre.</Review>< gmap_id>

It was great experience at the hotel. Room Size is the biggest ever I have stayed. Designed for 4 people per room. Ambience is good. Close proximity to the Stanford University and in the middle of a city makes it attractive.<//text>

Overall experience was not “upscale” as described by crowne plaza themselves. The room was like a motel with a window that opened onto a walkway where others could look in. The bathroom and the decor were dated. The shampoo etc, seemed low quality so I used my own,<//Review>< user>

<review>My wife's company hosted an event at this hotel and the entire experience was pretty underwhelming. The hotel has a nice lobby but the rooms are in terrible condition!
We quickly dropped our stuff off at the room and noticed the room was hot even though it was cold outside, so we turned on the AC and quickly made our way to the room with the festivities.
We returned at 1am and the room was still at 80 degrees!!! It was then that we noted the heater was broken and was constantly on. We got a hold of the night manager,who's name was Janette, and she gave us a fan!!! It's 2am now and the room is hot and uncomfortable and all we have is a fan!! Finally she moved us to a new room but was very rude to me as if it was my fault the room had a malfunctioning climate control system. We got to bed at 330am and I never want to go back there again.
As a side note, my wife was one of the organizers and it turns out this place also backtracked on some of the contract agreements. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT HOST ANY EVENT HERE!</review>< rate>

All facilities clean and rooms appeared fresh.
Without exception every staff member go above and beyond to make stay comfortable and welcoming.
An emergent situation resolved seamlessly and perfectly due to laser focus, professionalism and caring of staff.
Comfortable beds and EXCELLENT service.<//review>

< Review>
The rooms are tired and are missing modern options like multiple USB outlets,  The walk to my room was endless. My first room had a broken door which would not lock. Although I’m sure the cleaners do a good job, the rooms ageing appearance looks like it’s not clean.  The air conditioning is loud. 

The bed was comfortable and the in-room service and staff were delightful and helpful. 

In summary the people are good but the facility leaves much to be desired.<//Review>

...ruined what would have been otherwise a delightful stay.
1- Pulled out top dresser drawer to unpack and it came completely out of the frame and dropped on my toes!!! (Yeah, OUCH).
2- Maint could NOT fix TV remote. Could channel DOWN but NOT UP.
3- Paid $15 a day for valet parking that was a JOKE. Every ( and I mean EVERY) night I came back to the Hotel I had to go inside and chase someone down to park my car.</text>

I've stayed at this property a lot in the past. My experience with other hotels even during this pandemic has been mixed. Some properties are really trying to keep the guest experience pleasant and comfortable. This property has the ability to improve the guest experience with limited dining options and bar services but clearly chose not to try unlike their competition just down a block.<//review>

<Review>I stayed here on a business trip. It wasn't great for that. Probably much better for leisure. Mostly, I need a room with a microwave. When I book a suite, I kind of expect it. I eat most of my dinners in the room, so it's nice to have a way to reheat.

Also, the lightbulb above the toilet gave off a lot of heat. If you told me it was a mixup and it was actually a heat lamp lightbulb from the kitchen, I'd believe you.

The staff were all wonderful people and gave excellent service.<//Review>< pictures>

I have enjoyed this property for many years. I have not always had positive experiences with the staff, but as of late, I am very impressed with the level of service and commitment I've received. Dale, an employee who maintains the beautiful landscaping and large pool area went above and beyond to accommodate. He was a pleasure to chat with and took a genuine interest in our experience.</Text>

Hotel was at capacity and had to deal with the room I was given.  Room was dark and dingy.  Refrigerator was loud every time it kicked on.  HVAC was also extremely loud as it cycled on/off.  Something with the mattress in the room seemed off as well.  Despite getting a solid 8 hours of sleep, woke up every morning feeling completely exhausted with bloodshot eyes, which has never happened before, when traveling.  Easily the worst travel experience I've ever had.<//Text>

The room was lovely, super clean with most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! and OMG love they pillows!!!:))) bathroom with shower very clean. Reception was very helpful in directing us to nice pub and club , so we have great night out as well. After we came back - we found out that on every floor there are water stations with bottles so you can take them to the room! also guest request lockers - if we run out of tea, coffee of milk in the room! Its really like they thought of everything to please your stay! I tried food room service as well and in 20 min was delivered to our room! so happy with our stay that acually was sad to leave!</Text><user>None</user>< user_name>

<text>Lovely hotel impressive lobby and friendly staff. We stayed in room 609 and although quite close to elevator it was very quiet as well as being very clean and comfortable. Bar staff were attentive without being imposing and make fabulous vodka martinis. Breakfast was a buffet of a good range of hot and cold foods and bottomless coffee and juice if required. Plenty of self parking as well as a valet service.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The rooms were extremely comforting and the amenities were quite vast. I didn't get a chance to check out much other than my room, but the bed and bathroom were clean and most importantly the bed was extremely comfortable.</text>

This hotel is conveniently located near this yoga studio I came to do a workshop for, and after a long day of working out this hotel was the perfect place to recover my body. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom felt luxurious, and the morning breakfast was so delicious. I would love to stay at Crowne Plaza again.<//review>

<Review>We stayed in the adjoining building, not the main building. Room was spacious and clean. Beds were comfortable.  Weather was not ideal so did not get to use the pool but it looked nice and was cleaned everyday. Staff was extremely friendly during our stay. Had everything we needed.  Only recommendation would be to have a microwave in the rooms. Did have a fridge and Keurig coffee maker. Would definitely stay again.< /Review>< pics>

The room was clean and comfortable but I wish there had been better lighting in the main part of the room. Also, I used the portable mirror in the main part of the room but would have preferred a full wall mirror. Everything else about the room was very good.</Review>

My room experienced issues with the heat and instead of your rude technician listening to me as the customer, he insisted that I was wrong.  It took the wonderful lady at the front desk  to come to my room and confirm what I was telling the first technician the entire time!!! (3 hours ago)  The heat was on but was not blowing in order to circulate the heat within the room.  

Resolution- bring me a space heater!  Are you serious?  Crown Plaza should be appalled!  The prompt response should have been to move my room!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Love staying here - almost always accommodate early check in and quiet zone request.  Very nice staff.  Pool excellent.  Room always clean, amazing bed and pillows.  Fridge in every room, would love a microwave as an option.  Hate hate hate having to pay for parking in a simple open regular outdoor parking lot but that's CA for you.  Even IHG members pay full price.< /text>

Disability rooms really not catered for people in wheelchairs. Couple rails round toilet but no shower for people who can't walk. Impossible to get into a tub. The bed is so high. It's very hard to get a person who can't walk in and out if it even with a transfer board. Hotels should talk to person with disability to design better. Staff super friendly and food delicious though.</Text>

< Review>
Staff didn't recognize me as a Spire Ambassador member during check-in, even though I'm a frequent guest, at least 3 times per year. When I asked for late checkout, the front desk staff just say NO, stating the policy is 2pm, and I have to pay extra day if I want to stay later. I can understand they can't offer it if the property is fully booked, but the staff didn't mention it at all. Even when I told her I'm a Spire Ambassador member, she said this is a Crowne Plaza, and not InterContinental, and there is no such benefit to checkout later than 2 pm - which I had experienced in other Crowne Plaza! 
The hotel is OK to stay, as it is close to my work destination, but the staff needs more training.</Review>

Nothing special about the property. The room was relatively small. The staff not friendly. First the toilet got clogged. There was a mini fridge in the room. Put our left over food in there, come to find out that the fridge was not working and our food went bad. When checking out the staff did not ask how our stay was. They simply said, your payment is taken care off.For sure one of the least pleasant places to stay as compared to many other hotels that I have stayed at.< /text>

My family came in for a birthday and reunion party from all over the country.  We had a great time.  The hotel was very accommodating to our needs.  It made for a perfect weekend.  We even had the opportunity to enjoy the free shuttle to get to and from dinner Friday night.  That was an "extra" that everyone enjoyed considering difficult parking and a complimentary option to a paid ride.   The staff was so friendly and made us feel right at home.  It was very special.</Text>

<review>Between the military, school and family, I stay at a variety of hotels and resorts from California to Rhode Island... hands down, this has been my favorite and best experience. I tend  to travel a bit bummy after long days.  I’m tired, I know I look tired, but from check-in to check-out I felt like I was wearing a tailored three-piece suit.  Infused water at the front desk, local paper at the elevator, room upgrades (might I add, the new beds were fantastic and the balcony view was exquisite),  and a late and expressed check-out which allowed me to enjoy my non-rushed steak wrap with my kids at the restaurant conveniently located on the ground floor.  To the man who checked us in both evenings (I came back the following night after returning from the boardwalk instead of making the long drive home, worth it) to the woman who served us at the restaurant, this was the quality of service all hotels should try to emulate.< /review>< pictures>

An amazing place to stay! Really nice pool and really nice gym. The gym is open 24/7 and it has some pretty awesome equipment. The gym had a sauna too that was very spacious! Wonderful new bed in the room. The suite was sweet! Had everything I needed. Had a balcony overlooking the pool area which was very nice!</Review>

<review>The staff was great and very put going andhelpful.
The only problem we had was with the cleaning staff.
She needed to be able to understand English when we would ask for toilet paper, towels or coffee and cups she had forgotten when they were finished cleaning.
The valets Tom and Jimmy where helpful and very friendly and it was very nice talking with them

 Mary at the front desk and Daisy in the restaurant went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one.
We enjoyed our stay do to the great staff working there.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /GmapID></record>

Very nice hotel. Stayed there for two nights for a conference. The hotel staff were very polite and helpful and helped in running the conference smoothly. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel.< /text>

At the price we paid, there are other hotels in the area offering nicer rooms, with complimentary breakfast.  My room was nothing special.  The housekeeping does a fine job.  I found it frustrating each morning to remember that the only breakfast offered is some overpriced buffet that I couldn't justify when all I wanted was some toast before running to the office.<//Text>

Although room was good but.. quite considerable cheaps
#1 For no reason, a good portion of parking was kept reserved for paid valet which barely had any cars. For all others not only there is very limited spot but its quite at the back - NOT NICE! You guys definitely don't need to reserve such proportion of your parking for valet!
#2 Extra for overnight parking. Seriously? Are we not already paying enough for the room?
#3 Breakfast not included. ahem! big downside. Although you can pay and have one delivered in your room but its quite expensive and not worth.
#4 Rooms do not have microwave</review>

< Review>
I checked in overnight after a long day at an event and Crowne Plaza happens to be within my budget and closest to the event location. I was surprised how soft and comforting the bed was, yet doesn’t dent below me. It was a pleasant experience to distress. 
The staffs are really welcoming and friendly. They respect your privacy and insist on helping me whenever I need them. 
Just make sure when you’re checkin in with multiple of people, be sure to ask for a number of robes, slippers, and a hair dryer (if need an extra). Also ask for water before coming to your room. I didn’t know there wasn’t any water in the fridge.< /Review>

Clean and tidy room, well managed. Decent TV and cable connection. you'll have empty mini refrigerator, coffee maker,coffee powder but no drinking water.

In toiletries- no tooth paste, shaving lotion/ cream, but will give u a lot of soaps, shampoo, conditioner etc<//Review>

<Rate>None</Rate><Review>Initially, I was disappointed upon check-in. Prior to making the reservation I received confirmation that the hotel would honor a complimentary upgrade to a whirlpool cabana suite, (a benefit of being an elite member) and was reassured it was reserved for me. I frequently book this suite because the whirlpool aids in the treatment of a severed nerve from a leg injury. Upon check in I learned the room was given to another customer and I was assigned to a room without the tub. We had also brought food to save cost because the cabana suite has a mini kitchen.The assigned room did not have a kitchen and I had to make other arrangements to feed my son dinner. It was unsettling. I am a frequent, loyal customer and truly enjoy the property. 
Upon check out, however, Christina, a server in the restaurant, provided exceptional service, apologized for the inconvenience and went out of her way to keep the Sunday buffett brunch open longer so we could eat prior to traveling. I want to express my sincere appreciation for her patience, understanding and professionalism.
Christina made a 3* stay into a 5*. THANK YOU!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

We had such a wonderful time at this hotel. We were here for a wedding. We got one of the suites that overlooked the courtyard. The room was very spacious and clean! I loved the big tub and the balcony seating area. The bar downstairs was a lot of fun as we were there with family and friends having drinks before and after the wedding reception. The staff was very attentive! I would have to say that overall that it really was the entire hotel staff that made our visit so much fun! The only suggestion that I have is that they remodel their public bathroom on the first floor. It’s dark and dated. Everything else was perfect! Also, the hotel photos don’t do it justice. They really need to update the website.<//Text>

<text>I expect mediocre conditions when I choose a hotel based on price, but I have observed diminishing conditions during my annual stay here over the last three years that make this hotel a poor choice for a business traveler. Stained curtains, too few healthy menu items, always something wrong with my room, no one picks up room service trays overnight. This year the power went out at 6 am across the whole hotel and there was no effort made to check in with or advise guests. When I checked out at 8:30 am (power still out), no one even mentioned it until I asked what happened! I will say the staff is friendly even if not impressive and the beds are comfortable, so if the power stays on, this hotel is doable for a budget traveler if you don’t need more than that.< /text><Date>1560038400000< /Date>< pictures>

<review>Lives up to the concept of an over-done hotel restaurant fare. Lots on offer for a Sunday brunch but nothing is really good. Maybe except the custom ordered eggs, which I didn't try. They did have smoked salmon, which is hard to mess up. Over-priced for the overall quality of food.</review>< Gmap_id>

The Crowne Plaza was a great place to stay as I re-visited my old hometown of Palo Alto for my 57th class reunion! My room was on the 8th floor where I had a beautiful view of red tile roofs and the hills with a finger of fog. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable with lots of pillows. Bathrobe, slippers and an aromatherapy kit were waiting for me. Room service was prompt and the food was hot on arrival. Lovely experience!<//review>

<Text>The entire place is a joke. Especially for the money!! Maids barged in my room TWICE while I was asleep. 7:00 AM and again at 8:15. Food sucks, I was the only one at the restaurant. With three waiters and they still took forever, forgot things. Absolutely ridiculous<//Text>< Pics>

< review>
The A/C system in our room stopped working.  Called the front desk at 10:30 pm and was told they would send a maintenance worker.  1 hour later, no worker had shown up.  Called back and was then told they do not keep in-house maintenance workers overnight.  Asked for another room and then was told the entire hotel had lost A/C service.  We had to try to sleep unsecured with doors open and temps remained in upper 70s so did not sleep well.  The next morning, the front desk clerk said they were only offering 50% discount to sleep in hot room.  After heated interaction with manager,  that night charges were refunded.  They should have been honest at the beginning so we may still have had option to change to different location.</review>

<Text>Been to a few events organized here. I wanted to organize one being a marketer myself but they were pricey. I liked their presentation hall options and the lounge type meeting place beside the halls. Parking could be tricky during peak hours. If you want to stay close to some shopping like Safeway, Walmart etc, then this is your place.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>My family and I really like the Crowne Plaza/Cabanas in Palo Alto!  The pool is great for the kids (could be a bit warmer) and the lounge and view from the cabanas are great for the adults.  I have stayed here on business as well and really appreciate the cleanliness and safety compared to other options on El Camino Real.< /review>< rate>

This place is amazing! Not only is it a beautiful, clean, classy hotel, but the customer service is top notch! Our Daughter frequently goes to Stanford's Children's Hospital and we found this place a few stays ago by chance late in the evening after being discharged from the hospital. The staff upgraded us to a suite, took her food order after the kitchen had been closed, and even brought her some toys the next day (and a football for her brother). The service continued the next trip most recently and they upgraded us to a balcony so my daughter could see the outside as she recovered from her surgery. We are very grateful for this hotel and the great people that work there and will continue to come back!!< /Text>

< Review>
The bed was brand new and the pillows were luxurious. Room was clean and well furnished. Bathroom was lovely and exceeded my expectations. The internet was weak and the property had a lot of dead zones. TV did not have a good signal so the channels kept going out with no signal. I'm not a big TV watcher so it wasn't a big deal for me. The AC worked marvelously. Better than most higher prices hotels I've stayed at. I would definitely stay again.<//Review>

We were hungry and this hotel had a restaurant that was open. I forget what we ate but it took a really long time to get our food. They only had one server for the entire restaurant. The food was ok, but the portions small. The server was very nice and apologetic about the amount of time it took to get our food. Has been my personal experience that hotel food is never very good!< /review>

<review>We were in Palo Alto for the PAC 12 track meet and were pleasantly surprised with the accomodations at the Crowne Plaza.  The hotel is older, but has been well maintained and the staff could not have been friendlier.  The rate was very reasonable for the area and we loved that it was located a short distance from restaurants with a Whole Foods market nearby.  We only visited the pool for a short time just to sit outside for some fresh air, but we loved that there are shade cabanas provided for guests at no additional charge.  Parking was plentiful, close, and secure.< /review>< response>

The great location and excellent staff of the Crowne Plaza make it an almost irresistible hotel. Unfortunately, rates can be high, but during the Thanksgiving week they plummet. We were fortunate to be able to stay there and had a wonderful time. The beds could have been better, but other than that, our room was very nice. The room was clean and quiet. Staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and well taken care of.< /review>

<text>My flight was delayed and upon arrival my room was oversold and I was walked out of the hotel into a motel infront, on the next day when I finally checked in my room AC was not functional and the room smelled bad. When I brought my concerns to the front desk and asked for a different room, I was told to go back into my room and wait for engineering to come and fix the ac because the hotel was sold out. My AC problem was fixed. However the next morning my car had to warning stickers because I was never provided or asked if I needed a parking ticket. upon checking out I was told the system is down and I couldn't not get my receipt which is needed for my job. I was told the receipt would be mailed to me with the email they had in my account but I never received such email.< /text><date>1571616000000</date>< resp>

If you need to Visit San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay this is a great place to rest and get recharged. I visit all these areas for weekend Trips from Fresno for the attractions and musical instrument shopping. I stayed down the street for less money but not nearly the comfort and luxury. Spend the extra thirty or fifty dollars and get a huge pool , bar and a great breakfast sometimes included in your price. Ask when booking through IHG. Rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. I love the breakfast. It has a great spread and can be sweet or very healthy. The dining room is clean very roomy. The pool! It's big and deep and I can swim laps with no problem. 

What can I say. This is my favorite place to stay In Palo Alto. I have stayed a total or three times and will be back for sure.<//text>

< Review>
For a person who frequently travels to Palo Alto, and has stayed at every hotel in that area, Crowne Plaza is perhaps amongst the best option. It’s larger rooms, ample parking stands out.< /Review>

Hotel is generally nice and good for a business event. However staff was a little slow on the draw regarding ihg membership, room key, emailing invoice, etc. Not a huge thing but the hotel is pricey so you expect these things to be done well.< /review>

<Review>This property is beautiful, well-staffed and ideally located. The gorgeous flowers and fragrant jasmine that greet you as you enter the lobby are always a welcome sight. The hotel is walking distance to many neighborhood conveniences and attractions, and our room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Highly recommend this property that, according to a hotel associate, was originally established in part by actress Doris Day.(although unwittingly, through one of her investments).</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//Gmap_id>< Response>

This could be a lovely place to stay if it were fully wheelchair accessible-particularly with rooms among the rest in the hotel, instead of located away down a long, cold, dark corridor and obviously an afterthought in terms of true accessibility.
Although the pool area was closed, it did not appear to have a lift. The finest area did not have accessible gym equipment, the glass doors to the pool area were heavy and did not automatically open.
Staff is friendly; ambience is pleasant.<//review>

 Was very impressed with the staff and our room was quiet, spacious, and clean.  Only 5-10 minutes from Stanford and well worth the money.  This will be the hotel we'll stay at from now on.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>We attended a fundraiser event in the main hall. There is a nice area outside the room to receive guests. The main hall is a nice size and could accommodate upto 400 guests. The event we attended was decorated by a company call Elegantly Done Decor, they did an excellent job. This is a great hotel for events like this.< /Text>< GmapID>

Wonderful and helpful whether at guest services or front desk.
The kitchen was a bit slow but nothing to seriously complain about.
I enjoyed my stay. Thanks to all the staff.<//text>

<Text>The main building you see upon arrival looks nice and like a regular type of hotel. But ... if you book a "Cabana" type room, these rooms are more like a motel type of setting. My stay was in the "Cabana" room. Very nice if you like to hear noise from the pool area; even with the window closed.

My suggestion ... do your research thoroughly before booking a room here to make sure it's they type of room you are expecting.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Very much enjoyed our stay.  Room was large and spacious, first floor had balcony with chairs and a table facing south.  Great place to relax.  Price was remarkably reasonable considering we were staying is a very expensive city.</Text>

Traveled for a few days on business. Got a nice room on the 2nd floor and had a great experience. Top notch exercise facility and grounds are very nice.  Free coffee in the lobby was a bonus. Restaurant was good with good service.<//Review>

The hotel needs some updates/renovations. Overall it was clean and the printer worked when I needed it. 
The outdoor patio and pool are beautiful and parking is very easy. My room was on the first floor by the parking lot and it was a bit noisy. 
I paid over $400 for my room and do expect to have tissues and bottled water at this price.</Text>

I stayed here with many people for a conference. The breakfast was good and had lots of options to choose from. There are many conference rooms available for meetings and the like, with various sized tables available. This is a comfortable cozy hotel with good sized rooms. Appliance rentals were available for those that didn’t get a room with them, and there was a mini store for late night snacks. The seating and spiral staircase are beautiful. The hotel has plenty of space to host events and lots of parking for guests and busses. Part of the hotel is indoors and part of it is outdoors, and there are different style rooms in each. A grand piano in the main foyer provides a wonderful sound and is open to anyone to play. You can hear some lovely notes as people stop by. Overall a good place to stay.< /text>

<text>My flight was delayed and upon arrival my room was oversold and I was walked out of the hotel into a motel infront, on the next day when I finally checked in my room AC was not functional and the room smelled bad. When I brought my concerns to the front desk and asked for a different room, I was told to go back into my room and wait for engineering to come and fix the ac because the hotel was sold out. My AC problem was fixed. However the next morning my car had to warning stickers because I was never provided or asked if I needed a parking ticket. upon checking out I was told the system is down and I couldn't not get my receipt which is needed for my job. I was told the receipt would be mailed to me with the email they had in my account but I never received such email. Overall the motel I stayed was 10x better than paying 500 a night for a Crowne plaza. I wish I could give this hotel a 0/5 stars< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great pool area! Cabana rooms have a relaxing patio area facing the pool. The rooms are a little dated but the bed is comfy. Didn't get much sleep because people across the pool were talking all night long! We called the front desk and they said someone would check it out but it was loud until about 3am. Other than that, it was a nice stay.< /review>

From the moment we arrived until check out, we were greeted by the friendliest and most accommodating staff, including the valet (who also seems to be the go-to guy for many things),
 the front desk staff, grounds maintenance crew, restaurant/bar, housekeeping and room service staff. Our first evening began with complimentary wine and snacks in the lobby, which soothed us after a long day of travel. Dinner on the patio was relaxing and delicious, so much so that we ordered the same dish the second night from room service. We will definitely return to this hotel if ever in Palo Alto again.<//Text>

For the price of the room, you really get the most for you money. They covered all the aspects of your stay, everything was modern, and the customer service was on point. I would definitely stay there again, as well as recommend everyone visiting that they would stay there< /Text>

<review>Older established property in Palo Alto. HOWEVER, like the rest of the Palo Alto rip-off the room prices in this town are simply OUTRAGEOUS!I realize that the hotels have their own monopolies but frankly as many reviewers have noted it is 2-3 times the normal prices in hotels in other cities.Everybody is trying to get the Apple/Google/Stanford dollar.....< /review><Name>Orbitz reviewer</Name><UserId.>None< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<text>This hotel was very accommodating.  We had a small private patio outside our room surrounding by lush plants.  The extra touches like the aromatherapy package were very enjoyable and helpful.  We appreciated the information give at check-in about the history of the hotel.  Loved having water available and morning coffee.  Free parking!  We didn't bring a dog, but the hotel has a nice little area for our furry friends.  The pool and spa was clean and spacious. A great stay!<//text>< pictures>

<review>Our stay was great except the AC didn’t work near as well as it should because our room ever got below 73 and was very humid. The staff was also very accommodating after we had to leave our previous hotel(HIE Sunnyvale) we had reserved had rooms I couldn’t even drive my wheelchair into. The CP room had plenty of room to drive my wheelchair around in but there was little ramp/step into the bathroom that kept tripping eoolevwalking into the bathroom.<//review>< Pics>

it was a nice clean place to stay with plenty of accommodations. Only wish gym had barbells but i suppose that's too much of a liability, so understandable</Text>

This hotel has a touch of class. I was exhausted upon entering the hotel. Wasn't sure where to park but we came through the lobby and went up to check in. Check in was easy. My boyfriend was still hungry and ended up buying a soup. Unfortunately, there was no place to heat it up although I think he eventually found something. I came up and unpacked. Jumped in the shower and got ready to relax. I noticed the eucalyptus package of spray and massage creme, How nice, I thought. I sprayed the pillow and decided to play a little music. The music was all so relaxing. Unusual and just what I needed. My boyfriend jumped in the shower. I was so thrilled to have the massage creme. I was able to use the massage creme to rub his back and feet and off to sleep we went. It was really nice. A wonderful treat. The next day I took my time and went down for breakfast. I'm looking for a place to live in the area. I also had lunch the next day and invited a friend. We loved the food and the service was excellent. The room was so relaxing and I loved the little room where the Christmas tree was by the television although I wasn't able to sit there. All you need is a fire pit outside and a couple of nice chairs to lounge in. My only suggestion is to buy a couple of new flags outside. they were all ripped. I loved this hotel and my guest room was beautifully decorated in warm colors. If you had more television stations that would be even better. I loved my stay and will definitely be back! I'm planning a trip in February 2016 and I've already recommended this hotel to a friend of mine. Thank you for making this trip so nice. It is a great memory of an early Christmas in 2015! Happy New Year! Jill< /text>

Best Hotel around! I stay here for business probably about 20 times per year. The Hotel is nice although the rooms are due for an update they are large and spacious. Beds and Pillows are comfortable and the hotel is conveniently located to all. Staff is the best in town, friendly and welcoming and willing to help you with whatever you need. Place is a little dated but kept spotless! Hot coffee every morning and wine and cheese every evening in the lobby.</Review>

We had a very nice stay there.  Lovely pool, not sure why hotels close the pool so early though, we are all adults......anyway, minor inconvenience.  Great room.  Food is over priced so be aware, but quite good.  We will go back some other day.  Charles at front desk is top notch.</review>

This is a review of their breakfast buffet. They had very nice eggs, fresh fruit, and plenty of bread options. The servers were friendly and the OJ tasted great. I liked how we could serve ourselves at our own pace. Plus, they always brought fresh plates if you went for seconds.</review>

The staff was friendly and helped us in every area. Our room was amazing and the service for breakfast was A+ quality! Thank you for a lovely stay!
We only stayed one night. If we stayed a second night we would have had housekeeping come and clean the tile floors. However, other than that it was perfect!</Text>

This hotel was very nice. They had a very nice looking restaraunt and patio area. They also had a lounge area where we waited to check in since we arrived early. The room was very clean and spacious. We got the king sized bed and it was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. The location was on a major street but actually located far enough from the traffic so we were not bothered by noise at all. Overall the service was great. They also had a self service checkout with drinks, snacks, and some toiletries. I would stay here again.</Review>

The staff here is amazing, always smiling and will make sure you are taken care of. I can't name them all but from the front desk, to the bar/kitchen, to the shuttle driver, and the housekeepers they have all been very accommodating. The rooms are quiet and kept clean. I have been in and out of the Crowne Plaza for approximately the past 6 months and have no complaints. I will definitely be back to this hotel when I am back in the area.</Review>

Parking was easy. Check was friendly and fast. When we went to our room  maintenance working in the room working . But the front desk moved us to a different room quick and easy. The overall room was clean and nice. Furniture had a few condition issues and the mattress wasn't very comfortable. The sheets and blankets where stiff and not very soft almost scratchy like and over starched dress shirt. The overall service was great and I wont let something like bed sheets keep me from returning.< /review>

I visited here to pick up work friends and was greeted with free afternoon wine and cheese. The atmosphere was certainly welcoming and while I didn't stay here, I felt like part of the VIP guest list. The lobby was transformed into a makeshift wine tasting room with comfortable couches.</Text>

I stayed at this Crowne Plaza for a holiday visit with my daughter and other family members. I picked this hotel because of the special rate I got and because I was familiar with the property. My room was very clean, comfortable, and spacious. The breakfasts in the restaurant were very good. But I was most impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone on the staff with whom I had any contact.</text>

Free Happy hour was some how cancelled all week
Breakfast was slightly expensive at $18< /Review>

Pool was a huge benefit even though it is not heated. Entry gate non functioning at times. Occasionally towels were not available. Could do with the Terrace being cleaned regularly as many guests walk around it in shoes so it always looks grubby. 
Overall it is very good value and most of the staff very helpful and pleasant. 
We look forward to a repeat visit next year.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This hotel is in a great location. It is very close to Stanford. The front desk staff was average. I had asked to be put on a waitlist for their shiuttlw service the next morning since it was completely booked. I then specifically asked to be notified either way regardless. No one called. I also called and requested a taxi be summoned. The person with whom I was speaking seemed to be inconvenienced by this request, and didn’t seem interested in helping. Also, when I went down to the front desk at 9am there was literally NO ONE there. Very disappointing. The shuttle driver named Steve is AWESOME. He is very knowledgeable about the area, and was very helpful and professional.</Review>

I can't say enough good things about this property, especially about the kind folks on the staff. My daughter and I have been traveling 2 hours from home every two weeks to Stanford in Palo Alto for her Chemo treatments. We always try to stay at the Crowne. All of the employees have been very helpful and caring - Rose Marie, Gervin, Mary, Elliott and Javier to name a few! The hotel is clean and bright, the food in the restaurant is great and rooms by the pool are beautiful. Thanks for always making us feel welcome!< /Text>

<review>The room looks nice. But the design that the window is facing the corridor is arguable. The property looks good from outside, and it locates in a quite good location.

The front desk staff could have been warmer and more passionate upon checking in. Not only the front desk staff didn't greet me and acknowledge me as an IHG member, the staff didn't even return my greeting. I found the check-in experience is the worst among the IHG property I have ever stayed.

The housekeeping service should have checked the connection of the lamp and the clock in the room. I had to struggle and plug them in by myself.<//review>< pics>

I stay at many hotels during the course of any year and I can honestly say I have never experienced such a positive team spirit at any of them compared to this Crowne Plaza. From top to bottom nothing was too much trouble and the little touches like the free local transport and wine and cheese sessions made the hotel a delight to stay at.
I can't comment on the restaurant as we mostly enjoyed the many local facilities; but the breakfasts were good.
I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the Palo Alto or Mountain View area.< /text>

<text>The history of the Palo Alto Crowne Plaza made it even more interesting to stay ( originally the Cabana built by Doris Day). It is centrally located on the main street in Palo Alto, so getting around was easy. The staff was some of the most accommodating hospitality personnel I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I was there due to a parent's extended stay at Stanford Medical Center. They asked about my parent daily and showed genuine concern for her. I had to return twice and each time they provided superior service to help me book my stay.< /text>< Time>

I was surprised at how fast room service was, and how excellent the food was that was delivered to my room.

I always like the ambiance here; the lobby, the lighting, the morning coffee in the lobby.  

The room was quiet, bed excellent, it's always a pleasure to stay at this hotel.  I do strongly prefer to stay "in the tower."</Text>

<Rate>None<//Rate><text>I stayed here two nights on a business trip.  The staff were exceedingly courteous and kind. I enjoyed their wine and cheese tasting in the evening, and loved that they had water available throughout the day in the lobby.   The grounds were lovely and my room comfortable.  However, the bed was very firm (okay if you like that), and the room could use some maintenance.  But other than that - very comfortable and well-appointed.  The breakfast buffet was solidly good - lots of fresh fruit, oatmeal with lots of options for toppings, bacon, eggs, pancakes/french toast, various pastries.  Nice, but not extravagant.  Overall - I felt the price was a bit high for what I got - however, all the hotels were quite expensive in the area at this time.< /text>< pictures>

The staff is the bright spot for this hotel.  Everyone was friendly and very helpful.  Our room was poolside and made it very convenient for my boys.  We were in town for a football camp and the pool at the end of the day was welcomed.  The disappointment was that the hot tub was dirty both evenings we tried to enjoy it.  Ricky in the restaurant was attentive and served us a wonderful meal.  Overall it was an enjoyable stay.</Review>

<text>We used IHG Reward Points to make a long weekend out of attending San Francisco Symphony's performance at the Shoreline Amphie Theater.
The hotel location is ideal for this, but do not drive there! Traffic management is on 3rd world level.Take a taxi or Uber.
The hotel is nice. Rooms and common areas look fresh and recently renovated - except for the carpet.
Staff and service is exellent. Self-parking is unusually convenient.</text>< Pics>

Lovely room, and the bed was amazing, especially the sheets!  The carpet was very stained and gross-looking, however.  The bathroom had really dim lighting, and the noise from the pool area was disruptive till about 2am.< /Text>

Considering this is a Cabana Hotel, the pool and hot tub were poorly taken care of. Upon arrival, the hot tub was filled with small children jumping in and out with large floaties, disrupting the peace. We left the hot tub and returned later only to find that it was completely disgusting. The water was a greenish color and it had lots of gross things floating inside of it. I cleaned it out myself but was still disgusted with the fact that the water’s color was off. Definitely disappointed with the fact that the staff didn’t do anything about the children making a mess and playing around in the hot tub. On top of that, we waited 30 minutes for the staff to bring towels to the pool area. We didn’t want to get the inside of the hotel wet, and that’s why that, out of respect for the staff, we had waited for so long. The upkeep outside wasn’t great either.. A large branch from a tree that was in the parking lot had fallen onto someone’s car. My family’s overall experience wasn’t that great. The rooms were nice but Crowne Plaza needs to get the rest of their business in order.< /Review>

My stay was very comfortable and stress free.
The quality of the mattress, sheets and pillows helped with my comfort.
Some additional benefits:
A refrigerator,
Aromatherapy sleep aids,
great water pressure and shower head.
The room was very quiet.
There was an easy to use thermostat,
no off odors,
magnifying makeup mirror.
Newspaper delivery in the morning on my doorstep.
I really enjoyed my stay and will return in the future.<//text>

The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. We were greeted by the front desk as soon as we walked through the door. The room was clean and comfortable. The bar closed early (by our standards) at 11:00pm. We thought they might be open longer as we were a large group staying there. We will definitely stay there again.</Text>

<text>If you need somewhere to stay close to Stanford University, this is it. Great central  location in Palo Alto. Read some of the negative reviews about their customer service and almost didn't book a room here. I am glad we did though because our experience at this hotel was exceptional. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us in every aspect of our stay. I would definitely stay here again in the future. Also , it's listed as a pet friendly hotel but you wouldn't know it because the grounds are kept clean.< /text><gmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091</gmapID>< date>

I had an early flight and I was really beyond exhausted when I arrived. I did not have any reservations but Maritza, on the front desk was very helpful and accommodating. She helped me get one of the nice rooms with good deals. I was fully rested when I went to work the next day.<//review>

This hotel created a wonderful atmosphere for our class reunion as it is a classy hotel. The desk staff and the bellman were genuinely friendly...more so that most hotels I've stayed at. They all really made me feel important and comfortable. The room was excellent in all the right ways: cleanliness, amenities in the bathroom, quiet, great bed, bathrobe, slippers. The pool is huge with lots of lounging chairs. They have a nice bar, and for our group's meal, it was over the top with gourmet food. Everyone was amazed at the quality and choice of the food buffet. Excellent! Wonderful stay!<//Review>

I was in Palo Alto for a conference at Stanford. It was farther from the campus than I would have liked (about a 15-20 minute drive) but was fairly reasonably priced at the group conference rate. The front desk staff were all very nice and helpful. I was upgraded to a larger room but was charged the rate I had reserved. I had originally requested a room with 2 queen beds because a friend was going to share the room but when they decided against the trip, there were no single king bed room (with lower rate) left. The room was clean and comfortable. The towels were fluffy and white.<//review>

Location is good but parking was hard - a lot of people park in a weird way that takes up two spaces. Venue was big (I was there for a wedding fair) and clean. Overall well designed hotel - but the ballroom ceiling is surprisingly low.<//text>

Thank you so much for giving us a beautiful, incredibly affordable space with a view to celebrate many many months of stress. We’ve been renovating and selling an investment property, buying our own house, dealing with Taxes and the IRS, and both working out-of-State half the time. We also have 2 babies under 3 years of age. 

My employer didn’t let me off the floor to attend our work event until very late. But your beautiful hotel, ice cold mini-fridge, and accommodating staff more than made up for the stress of getting there. Breakfast-in-bed and a quiet morning topped of our stay and left us content and rejuvenated. Time to go move into our new house. It was so lovely to be the one being taken care of for a change. Thank You so much</Review>

The location is very good. The hotel has a nice setting for events like wedding or other banquet functions. Either pool side event or the banquet and dancing hall. The room is roomy. But in my suite of over 1,000- ft, I am surprised to see there is only a queen size bed and not King size !<//Review>

<Review>This Crowne Plaza is a very nice facility.  I am a Spire member; however, I was not able to be with my 25-year-old daughter initially when she checked in.  As soon as the woman checking my daughter in realized she was not the Spire member, her entire demeanor changed, like my daughter was some lowly person.  This left a bad taste in both of our mouths for our five night stay.

The gentleman at check-out almost made up for it.  He was wonderful, gracious, and friendly>

A couple of other things:  the internet did not work for the first 36 hours, and the walls are a bit thin, as I could hear people in the room next door.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>When making the reservation, we chose the "Poolside cabana Kingsize" room, which on the website was the only room with no photo available. These rooms appear to be in the oldest part of the hotel, and are showing some signs of age. Most importantly, I would expect a "Poolside cabana" room to have access to the pool. This is NOT the case. There is a tiny patio where you can see the pool, and a giant Iron railing that prevents one from getting to the pool area; hence one must exit into the hallway, walk all of the way to the end of the wing, into the hotel lobby then back out and again around another 100 feet to get to the pool. Having recent back surgery i thought the spa might be nice, but the foot travel to get there and back prevented me from attempting to use it.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The hotel's conference facilities are top notch. The space is well contained and well furnished. The staff is friendly, accommodating, and attentive. The hotel rooms, on the other hand, while clean, are oddly laid out. While the furniture is adequate, they seem weirdly mismatched. Some parts of the room are shabby. For example, the closet door in my room was broken and splintered in the corners.< /text>

<Name>San Francisco Native 1984</Name><userid>None<//userid><Review>This hotel was great all around! Very clean, put together well, great comfy beds, staff very friendly. Great experience!

The only issue I had was the fact that parking in your hotel cost extra money, that put me off and makes no sense to me why one would have to pay additional money to park in the hotel they are staying and paying for, it is ludacris to me. Just include the "cost" of parking to be reflected in the room / service and dont mention there is a parking cost. The fact there is a separate cost is ridiculous and is unnecessary.

Thankfully your front desk was nice enough to sign me up for rewards so I got the parking this time free. 

Honestly if there is an additional cost for parking I would not stay here again on principal...if the room stay is $12 more I would not care,  whatever the cost for the room is doesnt matter, its the fact there is an extra charge for parking just rubs me the wrong way...sorry for seeming crazy because I'm harping on this but it's just how I'm wired I guess.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza Cabana several times and enjoy it. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff is excellent. This is what keeps me a loyal customer to them.

The food is standard hotel fare, and reasonably priced. The menu is pretty limited, but what they do, they do well.

I need good wireless internet - and it has been flawless. The room cable service is also good.<//Text>

Close to Stanford and Santa Clara.

Nice pool area.

I would not consider this a luxury hotel, but an older business property. At one time it was known s the Cabana and owned by Doris Day.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Mattress bed was to hard the towels look very dingy. The bathroom floor still had hair and a few debris. The heater in the room was not working had to use our robes to keep warm. We where given a room where the hallway was exposed to the cold and rainy elements. They also charge a $12 parking per night in a very empty parking lot. Overall it was not a good place to stay and I  have stayed at their location in Foster City and that was a way better location with better services and working heater and cleanliness is a 5 star in Foster City with free parking.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>This hotel is nice and functional.  I think there are hotels with more character in the Palo Alto area.  The newer rooms surrounding the pool are very nice and modern, but the older ones on upper floors in the tower are not nearly as well appointed.  Get a garden view room if you can.<//Review>< pictures>

This hotel is great. It's my first time in Palo Alto, so I don't know how to compare to places nearby, but compared to many of the hotels I've stayed at for business this one ranks way up there. The breakfast was delicious and nutritious. The room I was more than big enough and the bed was king sized and very comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here and hope to do so again.</text>

Unfortunately, this hotel advertises that it is pet-friendly, however, pet owners are relegated to the most remote rooms and limited to the first and second floors. I have visited numerous other hotels and pets are welcomed wherever we are willing to pay for accomodations. I do not feel that this hotel is "pet-friendly" but "willing to accept pets on their own terms." In addition, I was not told that there was a $50 one-time fee for my dog. I have never been charged (even at homeaway/vrbo rentals) such an exorbitant fee for a one-night stay.

I do not recommend this hotel as pet-friendly.< /text>

Nice hotel. Stayed here for two nights. Big and spacious rooms. Tried the bar as well, reasonable prices for its central location in Palo Alto.< /Text>

<Text>Stay here often for work - almost ALWAYS get early check in when requested, front desk very accommodating and provide upgrades as space allows.  Pool area is well decorated with comfortable lounge chairs.  Best rates are gotten on the weekends - mid week can get pricey.  Rooms are always clean and well kept; if maintenance needed, they are quick and efficient. Will continue to stay here as my first choice in the area.< /Text><gmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//gmapID><Response>None< /Response>< user_name>

Fun fact: the Beatles stayed there during their British Invasion tour.  It's not run down but it feels antiquated, especially for the high price they charge for rooms. The staff is nice and professional. 

Unfortunately, I found a big hair in my shower and missed not having any counter space. They did offer a robe, a comfortable bed with good pillows, a gym and a restaurant and a breakfast bar. The basics were there but it was pricey.< /review>

The overall experience of our stay was very good.  I especially appreciated the infused water available in the front lobby. Would have appreciated a larger cup to be able to take it back to the room to enjoy.  The coffee in the lobby was a good surprise and was very good.  

Staff was very considerate and helpful.  We also enjoyed relaxing in the spa and pool.</Review>

Huge wedding that night was beautiful how hotel turned this lobby into beautiful venue for guest in wedding party and also made all guests feel special 

By far front desk was on it and catered to all guests 
I was extremely impressed also the dining room and breakfast was high quality band service excellent

Great hotel. Short Uber drive to town do Pali Alto. 
Room very comfortable. Nice bathroom and toiletries, even a relax pack. Bathrobes supplied. 
Breakfast was very good, even though we were in a temporary room on both occasions. . Fruit , croissants and quite a few hot options. Lovely staff , very helpful. Especially as I am on a gluten free diet. 
Didn't use the pool as there was a wedding on and it seemed busy. But other people said it was lovely. 
Nice welcoming supply of water with fruit in at reception, plus coffee
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. Very satisfied<//review>

The staff at this hotel are so friendly and helpful. They greeted me each morning and afternoon. The valet remembered my name and my car, so I didn't have to wait - he went to get it as he saw me coming. The room was surprisingly nice. The aromatherapy for nighttime was an extra treat! The only thing missing was counter space in the bathroom, but there was a nice shelving unit for use. Overall, a great place in the heart of Palo Alto.</text>

The hotel was easy to find, everyone was very helpful and polite. My room was clean and ready early for me, inviting with all the amenities readily available in my room. The room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable.

I like the reliably good service at Crowne Plaza Hotels.  I wish they had better vegetarian choices from room service.  I had an amazing veggie burger at the Crowne Plaza in Chicago and great breakfast choices at the one in Santa Clara.  The staff here didn't seem to understand what a veggie burger was!  
Still, I like this hotel chain and would stay again and staff did direct me to a nearby 24 hour grocery store that had a decent selection of food to take out.<//Text>

<review>Breakfast was the highlight of my stay.  The buffet was fresh and well-supplied.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is great, and the staff are attentive.

If my room had a better mattress, I'd probably give more top level ratings to this hotel.  A good night's sleep is essential during business travel, and it was the only thing really missing.  Perhaps it was just in my room, but the mattress sank too far and felt like it may have been older.  The linens were fine though, and the lighting was adequate to work at the desk.

There was also a guest wine<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I usually start at a Marriott and there's a reason why. I have a usual preference on rooms and this place didn't deliver. The beds aren't that comfortable which made my night rough. Next morning I realized I forgot my toothbrush and was charged $3 for a toothbrush which I normally get free. I'll see how these next 2 days go but so far not impressed.

(Edit)

Lowering score to 1 from 3 because the stay seemed to of gotten worse the longer I was there. Going back to my hotel room the door wouldn't lock. I called the front desk and it took maintenance close to an hour to fix it. I was in a slight rush to get to San Francisco before the sun went down but made it after the sun went down. I'll make a better choice next time.< /review>

<rating>None<//rating><Review>I had stayed in several Crowne Plaza hotels hence when I thought of a hotel to go to with my husband for our 10th year anniversary, this was what I suggested. The experience was okay and I really appreciated the kindness and attention to detail of one of the waiters at the dining. However on our last morning, my husband and I got down around 10am for breakfast and we were told breakfast was over, it was time for brunch and we will have to pay for the brunch (breakfast was included in our reservation). The employees at the dining area did well to explain to me and said I was supposed to have been told at the time of check in. They offered to refund us $2 for the breakfast and to pay for only 1 person's meal for the brunch but since my husband and I were not yet ready for something heavy, we decided to proceed with our plans for the morning. 

Upon check out I spoke to a lady at the frontdesk and she said two things that shocked me. First of all that she was sure that the person who checked me in must have told me about the rules of breakfast and secondly if I did not get it, either I was not listening or my mind was not there. I found it very rude that an employee at the frontdesk could make such a statement to a customer. She was not there when I was checked in hence she cannot conclude that the person who checked me in indeed told me (and my husband) about the rules of breakfast. To even suggest that I was either not listening or my mind was not there was even worse because both my husband and I can verify that the person who checked us in did not mention anything about breakfast.

I have always enjoyed my experience at Crowne Plaza hotels but this experience has made me reconsider whether I will use personal funds for a future stay at Crowne Plaza hotels.

My recommendations however will be:-
1. Let employees be retrained on customer service. One of the waiters is a fantastic example of how people should treat customers.
2. Have hardcopy information about the rules of breakfast somewhere such that if those at the frontdesk miss it, guests can read about it in their rooms or somewhere else.</Review><time>1523750400000</time><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Very attentive and helpful staff  at the front desk upon check in. I highly recommend Tommy at the front desk.

Good location. Easy to get in and out. . 

We especially like the grounds and ease of parking.
Easy access to room. For the first time I actually do not mind to stay at the ground floor. I find the queen room with two queen beds facing pool side is surprisingly pleasant. Clean room and comfortable beds with clean sheets and pillows.

The restaurant is fair but the service is good. Food is average.

Will definitely stay here again.<//Text>

Rooms behind the pool all have french doors that open up to lawn area. This worked great for our large family wedding, keeping us all connected by the lawn and giving the kids a place to run. Rooms were clean, updated, and comfortable. Grounds were pretty. No complaints. Got a great group rate, so the value for what we paid was very good. Staff was friendly. Only thing we were not told was that they have mandatory parking fee of $12. But parking was easy and convenient - could get close to your room.<//review>

My husband and I recently got married and used Crowne Plaza as our hotel and blocked off rooms for our guests. The location was 10 minutes from the church and 15 minutes from our reception. So location worked out perfect! The customer service was excellent and the management taking care of our reservations and room blocks was very attentive and always followed up with any changes made. The suite they gave us for the bridal suite was beautiful. I was able to get photos taken inside the room while getting ready the morning of my wedding. I will definitely reccomment Crowne Plaza Palo Alto as a great destination hotel for weddings in the peninsula area. Very pleased with the hotel overal!<//Review>

The stay was short but comfortable. The staff was very courteous and checkin was expedient.
Given future trips, I would highly recommend this Crowne Plaza to any IHG rewards members and people looking to stay at IHG hotels.
I did not have a chance to try the pool or fitness center area but on passing glance it was clean and well-maintained.<//Review>

<Review>From check in to time we left, staff at this location were always very positive.

We were attending a conference at the hotel and the staff handling the lunch buffet were exceptionally courteous, efficient, and attentive.

At the end of the stay, the front desk arranged to have a driver pick us up for San Jose airport which was so much better than the random taxi on the way in.

Overall staff at this location were most genuinely friendly and helpful of any place we've stayed in this chain.

Also helpful was map of area trail for walking.</Review><Time>1442534400000</Time><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /Gmap_id>< UserId.>

<Review>Reported problem on in-room Jacuzzi in late afternoon, came back to hotel after dinner, front desk claimed it is fixed, but it wasn't. Call front desk, engineer came, but have no idea how to fix as the main engineer left for the day.  He promised it will be fixed next day. In the next morning, front desk call and just say 600 points has been credited to my account for the inconvenient - no explanation. By the evening, it still wasn't fixed, call engineering, they couldn't fix it, need to have day-time engineer to come fix it next day. but have to check out next day. Could not enjoy the Jacuzzi, very disappointed. 
Came back the following week, they put me in another room with Jacuzzi, this one works.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm not a big hotel person because I am very picky when it comes to cleanliness.  This hotel was probably the BEST experience I have ever had in hotels. There was nothing I could say that was wrong with my stay here.


Unfortunately I was not there for business or pleasure.  Palo Alto is home of Stanford Medical Center, so I was staying at Crowne Plaza while my mother was battling for her life. It was a huge comfort to come back to the hotel after my long days at the hospital.

The staff in this hotel went above and beyond their duties to make sure I was comfortable.  Everywhere I went I was met with a caring face.  From the courtesy shuttle to and from the hospital, to the food service, bar and lounge  It was all excellent!
There was one particular individual and I wish I would have gotten her name. She would greet me every morning as the host of the food lounge.  She read my body language and knew something was wrong.  She stayed with me at the table while I cried and didn't leave my side until she felt I was ok.  Now thats an angel!  I don't know if I will ever see her again, but I would really like her to know the impact she had on me that morning.  My mother died the next day.

This entire hotel employs quality people who really care.  I can't say enough about my stay here. I would definitely come and stay here again.<//Review><rate>None</rate><Time>1477180800000< /Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>None<//userid><name>DebnKev<//name></record></dataset><record>

<review>What stood out the most is the excellent service the front desk staff provided. As well as the excellent bedding in the room. By far one of the best nights sleep I’ve had.

Thank you</review>< pics>

It is located very close to downtown Palo Alto and is a short drive to all of the attractions there. It was also biking friendly and very accessible to Stanford University. The staff are friendly and helpful; the restaurant was excellent and had great quality food; the room was very comfortable (although the rooms are a bit small); the bathroom was VERY nice and included nice amenities for a relaxing weekend trip. I cannot say enough great things about it and would definitely stay there again when business brings me back to Palo Alto.< /Text>< user_name>

<Text>Need to clean or get better shower heads; half of the holes sprayed sideways.  The drawers in dresser did not close properly which made accessing the refrigerator difficult.  The maid service did not replenish toiletries or replace used glasses.  Paying $12 for parking when it is free at every other business hotel in the area is annoying.  The shuttle driver Steve never answered or returned phone calls for pickup.  The air conditioning vent in the room was filthy (which is probably why it was so loud).  No televisions in the fitness center, and the water rowing machine was overfilled with water.  Check-in for 3 rooms on the same booking and credit card took way too long considering there was no one else waiting.< /Text>< Response>

Super friendly staff, especially Steve who remembers who I am each time. Room on ground floor opens to a small priavte courtyard by the pool so you don't feel couped up like other hotels. Great bar and restaurant. Monday's there's food trucks and music out front, so solo travelers like me can socialise.<//text>

The Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto is very suitable for people who want to visit this area and stay. Compare to other hotels, it is inexpensive but still have clean room and option dinning. I spend much time during the day, so I don't use other luxury amenities. A clean room is good for me.<//Text>

<review>I stayed one night and had a tower room. It was pleasant and up-to-date. The bed was very comfortable and the towels were cushy. My room had a lovely view of the pool in the foreground and the hills in the distance.

The staff were all very helpful and friendly. I needed something at a grocery store and not only did they direct me they suggested I could use the shuttle driver to take me there.</review>< Pics>

This is a conveniently located hotel, and a nice place to stay for business or pleasure. The pool-side rooms have nice patio seating, and the many common areas provide ample opportunity to relax or conduct work out-of-the-room. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet. The restaurant menu was excellent, although a bit pricey. Overnight parking is valet only, and an added although reasonable priced fee.< /Text>

I enjoyed working at the hotel when necessary during my trip and found it relaxing when I finished my work day.
The valet staff was quick and even had my check-in process started before I approached the front desk.
I also enjoyed the complimentary wine< /Text>< pictures>

I had a pleasant stay and the only two less than glowing comments I have is that there was a long wait at 1:00 pm for a drink by the pool. It was a busy Saturday, staff apologized, but if they had told me they were that busy I would have gone an got the drink myself. 

I also did not like the glass bathroom doors. I prefer more privacy although the doors do allow more light.

The room was clean, comfortable, had a nice sized refrigerator. I had a wonderful stay.</review>

The Grich that stole Christmas. We had our Christmas party here, everything was fine until... out of a party of 15 EVERYONE became sick except the one woman allergic to sea food. It tastes Good, but who wants to spend Christmas on the throne? It's a shame, we've been going there for years, but this will be the last time. DO NOT RECOMMEND.<//Review>

This hotel is a real gem with the friendliest, most accommodating staff I've ever experienced staying in Palo Alto. The room was spacious and clean, the food in the restaurant was excellent and the drinks were made perfectly. I had a Manhattan while sitting at the bar and the bartender knew exactly how to make it. I couldn't believe how friendly everyone was!

I understand this hotel was opened back in the early 1960's and it still has that vintage charm that's all the rage now. I highly recommend this hotel, I know you'll love it too!<//Text>

Needed a room for the evening and this place for the bill perfectly.  Price and quality of the room was much better than the local hotels in the area.  The location is convenient but not necessarily close to downtown area.  It's the best value on the El Camino.  Friendly and helpful staff.</text>

Loved our stay at the Crowne Plaza. The beds were great. Nice bedding. Comfy room, nice bathroom. Plenty of room for 3 folks. 

Wish you had a free breakfast and the parking fee was not indicated on the site I booked on. At least I did not notice that until I got to the hotel.

Staff was very friendly.< /text>

<Text>The Service and Employees were warm and friendly from the moment we pulled in up front of the hotel.  from the valet to the young man you helped me into my room with our bags.  Room service was clean, fast and the food was wonderfully presented and tasted even better!  Our stay was relaxing and we rested well.  Thank you to the staff at Crowne Plaza Hotel Palo Alto!</Text></record>

I was on the call and fricked out when she came!
So i told her i’ll be check out at noon (which is their checkout time)
And she opened the door (WITHOUT KNOCKING!) again after 1hour!!!!!!! i’m not sure she forgot or something.

So told her same thing again.

Guess what!? She opened the door 3 times more.
( i totally understand she wanted cleaning the room SO bad but it’s kind creepy tho)
Geez! Idk she intentionally did it or not but it’s so disrespectful. 

And i didn’t bring it up to the frontdesk people when I checked out since i was headed big meeting.

I never experienced this kind of happening tho..

Except that freaking creepy experience, i really enjoyed the place. 
Room service food was great as well. I even double tipped them.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We had a wonderful three nights stay. The staff were very friendly and the cleaning staff were amazing. It was a beautiful hotel and close to all the sites and events we were in town for. All the beds were comfortable and the towels were all soft and fluffy. Everyday, our room was immaculately cleaned. We really appreciated how quiet and tidy the hotel was--giving us a very pleasant stay. The air conditioner didn't always cool the room down when we wanted, and our toilet got stuck a couple of times. However, the maintenance staff were quick and very pleasant.<//Review>

My company booked this hotel for me as we had to do some work in the South Bay. The service is exceptional here and the rooms are fairly large. The hotel provides a free shuttle that worked out well for our team. I also enjoyed the HUGE gym here. 

If I have to come back to the area I will stay here again.</Review>

<text>I booked a last minute stay because I signed up for a half marathon in Woodside. It was the perfect place to stay and I felt lucky that I found this hotel without doing much research. The front desk, curbside staff and restaurant staff were all helpful and friendly. It was close to my race and fun restaurants and bars were only a 10 minutes away. I would definitely stay here again.</text>< Pics>

I loved the hotel. Didn’t love the parking fee. Most hotels in the area do not charge and the fee was kind of hidden. Other than that, the hotel was beautiful and the staff were fabulous.<//Review>

Its location is great and you dont want to leave once you are there with the pool great parking great staff. A big big draw back is the lack of bar food while after a late night of work and just wanted some snack food the bar was our choice the choice of drinks were great but trying to get something to take the edge off but not wanting a meal was missed. no real snacks offered by the bartender, no snacks on the early closing restaurant. the space was great to have a few drinks with co-workers and i even had a friend come by. my friend and i ended up leaving looking for a spot that had some snacks to enjoy a larger selection of draft beers.<//text>

Checked in to a room that had no working air conditioning. When switching rooms, asked for an upstairs room to be told what I am paying only got the 1st and 2nd floor - even though I have paid less and stayed on upper floors at the same hotel and people in my group staying at the same time paying the same were staying in floors above 2. I had to check out early for personal reasons and was told I would be charged a cancellation fee of $200. I asked to speak to a manager, none were available, left my phone number to have them call me and no has ever called. For the money, stay some where else that will give you better service.</Review>

My family booked and pre-paid for this hotel, when we got our room the description of the room (Club Room) did not match (there is no Club and the space was not what we requested for sleeping arrangements for our 2 year old) but the hotel fixed this. All seemed fine with the stay, but a few weeks later when our credit card bill arrived, I saw an unauthorized additional change (not parking, not meals that were authorized) on our bill for our pre-paid room. I called that day and they said they would remove it, a couple weeks later it was still on the account. I called their accounting department again to be told that the pre-paid hotel room cost more and are trying to figure out why the charge went to me. Hopefully this will be resolved, but it has ruined the experience we had with the hotel.< /review>

My wife and I stayed in the Beatles Room, with the memorabilia from their 1965 stay at the hotel then called the Cabana Hotel that even had a vinyl record player and some old Beatle LP's.  We stayed 3 nights visiting my son at Stanford.  We had a very comfortable stay and the hotel had very friendly and professional staff.  

When packing to leave I notice how my lap top blended in with the color of the desk top it was sitting on and thought to myself, good thing I noticed that now.  Well as you might guess I did in fact leave it and it wasn't until I got home and two days later couldn't find it that it dawned on me what must have happened.  A quick call to the front desk and they confirmed they had it and my son picked it up and sent it and dropped a little gift to the head of housekeeping to ,thank the honest person who found it.  That's the kind of hotel it is.<//Text>

<Review>Last updated in the 80s with the exception of the new and comfortable mattresses, I would not recommend anyone stay here. At $500 a night, I expected less motel and more hotel; less standard Quaker Oats and more steel cut oats; fewer kids running around the lobby and more business persons doing business. Alas, I was stuck with disappointment.<//Review><response>None<//response><pics>None< /pics><date>1550016000000<//date><gmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091</gmapID>< user>

Everything about our stay was absolutely perfect! The room was beautiful, comfortable and spotless. Every member of the staff that we came in contact with was friendly and helpful, and the Front Desk Supervisor (Zeenal) went out of her way to make sure that we had an unforgettable visit. The complimentary breakfast buffet was delicious! We enjoy the Crowne Plaza Cabana more than any other hotel that we stay at and we will be back every time we have an excuse to visit the Bay Area!< /Review>

Due to other reviews on this property, I was 50/50 before checking-in. And after two-nights, I am 100% a fan!

At this quiet college town, this is a BIG hotel property.
Full service bar, and HUGE dinning area.
The room is clean, and the bathroom is spacious.

Parking is convenient, and so is the business center.

If you are in town for NCAA basketball games or business, come and check this place out~! you won't disappoint.</Review>< Time>

Who checked into the Crowne Plaza about 10 at night. The only rooms available were those with outside access, so they were offered at a cheaper rate. It was nothing fancy, but the rooms were clean, and furnished well. The decor was a little outdated, but reasonable for the price of the room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. But there is no Bell or room service.

<Text>What a great hotel! Super friendly staff and very large rooms. Some of us wondered if we had been upgraded to a suite because of the size of the room, but we were told those are the standard room. Very clean, very detailed housekeeping staff. I loved pool area, I just wish it didn't close so early.
I also wish I could remember the name of the bartender gentleman who worked the first couple days of my stay. He was very nice, and had lots of info about the area to share, he's a keeper.
Thank you for a great stay, I look forward to visiting the area again.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091</gmapID></record>

Came with my family to visit our son who recently moved to Palo Alto. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Hotel is conveniently located with easy access to freeways and local restaurants. The only thing I didn't like was that the hotel website/reservation page doesn't explain there is a charge for overnight parking until after one makes the reservation.<//Review>

Whenever we purchase a product or service, we all expect to get what we paid for.

When things go wrong, we expect those responsible for the product or service to correct the root issue.

We communicated "as soon as" the hotel's mishaps happened.  NO ONE listened to us, heard us or moved quickly to RESOLVE the issues.

It took speaking to five (5) different staff members, leaving three (3) different voicemail messages, and writing a very detailed email to the general manager.

If you keep giving your money to people and/or companies that prioritize a dollar bill over healthy and functional business relationship, you'll get the same low-bar product or service.

Raise Your Bar.

This was our VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE at the Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto.

We are not responsible for maintaining the property.  We are not responsible for the job of those in charge at the hotel.< /text>

<review>The one thing I would highly suggest for IHG properties is to have bottled water in the rooms, especially for Platinum Members at no charge. I travel quite a bit and stay at other hotels and they always offer water for members at no charge.

When I stay at this hotel it always surprises me that they never offer water and I have to remember to stop and get some on my own.

If the manager can take the time to print out a thank you letter, then can they please remember to put water in the room?

Thanks!</review>< Pictures>

The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. The overall hotel was very nice. I enjoyed the free diffused water in the lobby. Hotel bar was nice and empty. Good moscow mules. The room was pretty humid and warm. The AC wasn't working properly. It was warmer in our room than it was outside (in July). 

Also, I added breakfast on to my reservation but wasn't told by the customer service person on the phone that it ended at 9:30am (that's pretty early to end breakfast). If i'd known, I wouldn't have added it.<//review>

We were planning to stay one day as my grandmother was staying at Stanford Hospital. We had to travel up a day earlier and needed to add a day and attempt to do an early check in so my mother can get rest from the all nighter. The hotel was understanding and extremely accommodating. Because of them, we were able to enjoy our stay as much as we could given the circumstances.</Text>

< review>
We were coming into town for a Football event for the Blue and Grey super combine. By the time we booked our room we could only get a King bed. I mentioned to the gentlemen on the phone while making the reservation that my son and I would just have to share. When we got to our room they had added a twin for my son. That was so amazing! For them to take the time and effort.

The front desk was helpful with the information for the event. They also provided directions around the area. My son was looking for a Chick Fe-lay.
The staff in the front of the hotel was very helpful with parking instructions as well. We are from the Vegas area and are used to completely different parking arrangements

The evening of the banquet the staff was also right on point. The tables were lovely the room clean and updated. When you have several hundred people eating from a serving line and over 100 of them football players, who unless you normally feed one have no idea how they eat , running out of food happens.They only Item that ran out was rolls, Which the staff promptly refilled. The food was also very tasty.
As the evening went on a couple of us had wanted some coffee. A staff member quickly brought us some with all the condiments. I would recommend this facility for any event.<//review>

I stayed at this property for 5 nights and 6 days paying a high prices for the room.
How ever the room was given to me after waiting for an hour and also well past 3 pm .
The reception was very cold and unwelcoming and the allotted to me was on ground floor with no view.
Even after repeated request on every day morning for change of room, it was denied.
Very unhappy experience. One of the worst I ever had at any other hotel.< /Text>

<text>We have stayed at the Cabana before, but this time we decided to make the most of the "hotel part" of our trip to Palo Alto. We had a delicious steak dinner on our tiny patio overlooking the pool and then an evening swim. (Well, the kids swam, the adults enjoyed the hot tub.)

The room was comfortable for our family of four. The staff is solicitous and friendly. The location is good for our particular needs.

We'll be back!</text>< pics>

the person who checked me in obv wasnt properly trained. he never acknowledged my platinum status, so no upgrade and no arrival gift. when i asked for a bottle of water he initially didnt want to give; only after i reminded him of my platinum status did he give the bottle of water. the room he first assigned me (on floor 2) overlooks roof top aircons that make humming noises that bothered me; when i asked for a room change he assigned me to a room in an annexed part to the main building which cant be an upgrade if not a downgrade. other than that my one night stay was good and other staff were all courteous and helpful.< /text>

see my previous comments. Outrageous parking charges when parking is free everywhere in Palo Alto. I parked in the back of the hotel and was still charged $60 for that spot.Also very poor service in the restaurant. I had to flag down a waiter to bring me a menu after 10 munutes of waiting. He dropped the menu on my table and did not say a word. He never returned to take my order. I had to ask another waiter to take my order. That took another 20 minutes. I told her what happened and all she said was "Oh". Should have asked for the manager but I was just happy to finish and pay my bill.<//text>

<response>None</response><review>Upgraded to a big suite with my status - room was lovely and clean although balcony/terrace was right next to what looked like a balcony for an event space (which wasn't in use for my stay)

I was woken up however by the sound of people on the treadmills in the gym which was on the same floor - not ideal when I've been travelling and need rest, but not the end of the world when I had to get up for an event about 30 minutes later. Not sure if any other rooms could hear it but it wasn't very nice!

Wish I'd been able to use the pool - pool area looked lovely.

Did get a free glass of wine in the lobby after a long day!< /review><user_name>Pip9<//user_name><gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//gmap_id>< Rate>

You were originally going to see a concert at the Shoreline and got a hotel to hang out at before and after. I love the hotel so much and wanted to hang out by the pool and decided to not even go to the concert, plus it was so hot that weekend.  Is my second time here and I will definitely be coming back<//Text>

This was my second visit to this Crowne Plaza location, and I was not disappointed! The staff was as friendly as on my first visit and quite helpful. I was particularly pleased with the shuttle to downtown Palo Alto which made going out to grab dinner from some of my local favorites a breeze!</Text>

The food ordered from room service was tasty and the service was quick. 

The location was great for getting to my office as well as restaurants and shopping. 

There was also a shuttle to get to Cal train which was convenient.

<Review>Awesome hotel! I had a great stay. The staff was very accommodating to my needs, and were always polite. I would recommend clarifying the complimentary shuttle service. When I made my reservation, I was told that the shuttle went every half hour to Stanford (my destination). However, when I needed to be at Stanford, the shuttle was not available (the concierge said it started later than I was told). It cost me a lot of money for a taxi. Fortunately, the rest of the time, I was able to get rides from other event participants. I only wish the shuttle schedule had been made clearer. The pool and hot tub are great, and even though my room faced the outside and was near the lobby and parking lot, it was totally quiet!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The room was extremely relaxing and I had a great night's sleep with the blackout blinds, soft bedding, and aromatherapy kit. During the day, we really enjoyed the table and chairs on our individual "patio", the french doors that opened out to the pool, and the hot tub next to the pool with some great cabana seating poolside. I used the business facilities room in advance of a meeting for some printing and it was also very nice.<//review>

Everything was ok in this hotel.  Room and toilet are clean although toilet could be brighter and have a better functioning tap (rather than just aesthetic only).

IHG rooms tend to have brown doors and colour scheme which I find very dated but that's just me....

It is still a pain to walk to every light and applicance to run off power when I leave the room.  But this is an issue in almost all hotel rooms I stayed in in US.</text>

As a frequent traveler who stays in a variety of mid to upper level hotels, this specific Crowne Plaza is like no other hotel.  I was welcomed to their home as a guest.  They waited on me, conversed with me, cared for me as one of their own.  It was a highly unusual stay.  I left the property wondering when I could return specifically to this hotel.  The food was unique and delicious.  The bed provided a full night's rest.  The room was appropriately cooled.  The room service was attentive and cheery.  And, it was because of the guest care I received, I will most definitely return.< /text>

For what it is the hotel was rather expensive but that was more the location than anything else.  It is an older hotel but well looked after so no issues with its age and certainly has more character than most these days.  Stayed in the Beatles room which was pretty cool and the staff were friendly and helpful.< /text>

<Text>Nice property right on El Camino Real in Palo Alto, which made it very convenient for my needs. The room was spacious, clean and modern. The check-in and check-out experience left a lot to be desired, though.

Upon check-in, my IHG Platinum status normally ensures that my key is ready, and I just need to pick that up and head to the room. At this property, though, I had to fill out paperwork in the same way that anyone that didn't have a reservation would need to, even though all of that same information is also in my IHG profile (which they acknowledged they had access to). What should have been a 2-3 minute check-in process turned into a 20 minute debacle where a staff member clearly under training tried to get this done.

Check-out brought more of the same. No bill under my door as normal, so I had to go to the front desk to get a copy of the bill. Again, what is normally a 1-2 minute print out took over 20 minutes to get done.

Maybe when the staff is fully trained, this hotel will be worth staying at. Until this, I'd stay away for a bit until that is resolved< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

She would always reply quickly to my emails and was knowledgeable when it came to putting together the perfect wedding. I would highly recommend her to anyone who is getting married here!

The day before, I had a bunch of people come and check-in to the hotel. The front desk staff was super patient and friendly. They helped everyone get into a room as soon as possible. The bellmen were also super helpful in moving all of our luggage and flowers into the necessary rooms. The staff was so friendly, they even remembered me a week later when I came back to pick up the rest of my things!< /Review><user_id>None< /user_id>< Rating>

<Text>A busy weekend for hotels. I was disappointed the pool was not heated but the room and general atmosphere and service was good. The front desk attendant was very polite and helpful and Gabriel who was our waiter at breakfast was extremely attentive and friendly. Overall it was comfortable and convenient for our purposes.<//Text></record>

I booked and paid for an executive king suite but was informed on check-in (11pm) that there had been a "cancellation issue" with my room and I was offered either a standard king or a Cabana 2-queen room as an alternative. The explanation given as to how this could have happened was very vague and noncommittal -- but let's be real: I booked a particular room and they either rented it to someone else (their mistake) or perhaps it experienced a secret maintenance issue that could not be resolved (their problem).

I had to press to receive compensation for the downgrade. I was offered an extra drink coupon and free breakfasts, which were a nice gesture but of no use to me given my schedule. They ultimately knocked a bit off my nightly rate, which made me feel somewhat better, but really what I wanted (traveling for business) was the nicer room. The staff was pleasant enough about the issue, but clearly wanted to "get it over with" in the most expedient fashion possible. The manager kept reminding me that he was willing to put me in these rooms "due to [my] gold status" as if providing me with a downgrade was somehow doing me a favor.

I went with the Cabana room at the recommendation of the night manager. The Cabana rooms are adequate by mid-tier hotel chain standards but in definite need of a refresh compared to the "main hotel" rooms (older tile floor as opposed to marble in the main hotel, older windows that make a whistling sound due to air pressure, etc.).

I want to like the Crown Plaza Cabana as it's convenient to a business destination for me and I stay there fairly often (5-6 times per year). Out of those, I'd say I've had some sort of issue with my visit around 50% of the time (false fire alarms going off during the night, room availability issues, item disappearing from lost-and-found). I'm honestly a very go-with-the-flow business traveler and not a "complainy" kind of review writer. But I'm going to think twice about staying at this particular hotel again, it's just gotten to be too much.< /Text>

<Rate>None</Rate><Text>Eclectic furniture in guest room gave the impression they chose the furniture based on what fell off the truck. There was no available outlet at the bedside. I had to unplug the clock after moving out the night table. Heat was very high upon entering the room, so I turned it down. After that, it never kicked on again, so the room was a bit colder than comfortable.

The gym had 3 treadmills, and one would not start up on "quick start."

Staff was very friendly and room service was excellent. Conference rooms and catering was also very good. Strong wifi as well. Free bottled water throughout stay and lots of areas for side-chats in lobby and lounge. Rooms and bathrooms were clean. No sign of bedbugs in my room (most important!).< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Stay here often and never disappointed. Almost always get a room upgrade. Staff excellent. Internet free for IHG member. Room quiet and always clean. Always able to get me early check in. Dinged my review on sleep quality because of the pillows but that's a personal preference. I don't like squishy feather pillows, more of a fan of supportive foam. But bed mattress, darkness, quietness all very conducive to sleep otherwise.
Only argument... parking is $12 to self park about 20 feet away, even for IHG members. There is no lack of parking or space so always rubs me wrong to get charged for that.< /Review>

The Crowne Plaza Hotel in Palo Alto, is a clean hotel, from the lobby, to the pool area, to the guest rooms. I was impressed with the cleanliness of this hotel.

The bed was comfortable, which made it difficult when it was time to check out.

The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.

This hotel is close to many restaurants, many within walking distance.

I would, without a doubt, stay at this hotel again.< /Review>

We stayed at this hotel for the duration of Stanford's graduation ceremony (2 nights). Requested to pay for parking, room was lacking regular coffee and cups - upon arrival and after our first night, there was no microwave, there was no fan in the bathroom, complimentary breakfast only if we checked out before 8am, bed/pillows were not very comfortable, A/C (fan) ran continually. Total bill = 2 nights stay, 2 cocktails, 1 dessert and dinner = $1000!</Review>

<review>This is a great hotel will stay again just hope next time the management can setup a payment discount for Veterans and there families that need to stay in outside hotels as the VA has very limited rooms so overflow go's into City of Palo Alto and we come a long way sometimes to get the special service that only the Veterans Hospital in Palo Alto can provide. Maybe the Government discount can include Veterans and family that need to stay in Palo Alto. Other than that it is a great place and have stayed before and will return again. The staff worked with me and were really outstanding one person at front counter Robert not sure of his last name but really went out of his way to help. Thank you and see you again soon.

Location is only 5 mins from the Veterans Hospital in Palo Alto.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The hotel staff are very friendly. I travel to California several times a year and I wouldn't stay anywhere else. I still remember one of the first times I stayed there and had a terrible fall at the airport and they couldn't help enough. They all volunteered a wheelchair and ice. I don't know how many places you can go where the staff goes above and beyond.

I also use Crowne Plaza for personal travel as well as business. I feel always at home when I go to the Palo Alto Crowne Plaza. I guess because I have stayed there a lot in the past three years.

If you have the opportunity to take the shuttle, the driver is soooo knowledgeable about Palo Alto and he knows the spots to eat.< /Text>

not the best location, you'll have to drive a bit to get to some decent restaurants and shops. it does have many onsite amenities. quite overpriced for what it is, especially not worth it if it is a personal trip. you can end up getting a room with a window that faces the walkway, meaning no privacy and motel-style feeling, even as a Platinum Elite member.< /Text>

<date>1510444800000<//date><Rating>None< /Rating><Text>This was a business trip 400 miles away from home, reserved by the company I work for. Upon checking in, as customary hotel required personal credit card for any incidentals. There should’ve been $100 held from my account for incidental transactions. However the entire room expense was suddenly deducted from my personal account opposed to the company credit card that was already on file, a difference of $300. This caused my bank account to overdraw. I immediately got a notice from my bank via text. I brought the error to the attention of the front desk staff. They were apologetic and attempted to correct it immediately however the damage was already done. I assumed, it would take possibly after a few hours for it to reflect the correction on my account. However the next day there still was no change. I was teaching a class in one of the hotels conference rooms all day , which was now Saturday . When I finished my class at 5 PM nearly 24 hours after the mistake I still have no funds in my account. I went back to the front desk to see if they could see any changes on their end. I was informed the funds would not be released until Monday and then asked if that was OK. Apparently there was no way to reverse the charges on my account due to how the banks in companies exchange information. I stated to the gentleman I had no money and nothing to eat and if this was the case it would be two days before I would get to eat. He smiled and said “OK have a nice night.” 

This was an honest mistake, at no fault of myself, yet there I was, stranded with the thought of not eating for two days. So I decided to call guest services at IHG headquarters. The first representative I spoke to stated: “well I’m sorry this happened. It sounds like this was mostly our fault.” Stunned, I repeated “MOSTLY your falt?” He replied, “your company should have been specific about which card the room would be paid with.” I corrected this misstatement, reminding him they already had the company card on file and the hotel stated they just needed my card for incidentals. He then stated that he would be unable to help me.

I asked if there was anyone I could speak with that could help. He transferred me to a supervisor. The female supervisor seamed frustrated, not understanding why I called and what I wanted them to do. I stated, this error was no fault of my own, and I was curious why the hotel had not even offered me a meal knowing their error has left me with no means of purchaseing anything. The supervisor placed me on hold for approximately 5 minutes. Upon returning to my call , she stated she had just spoke to the front desk of my hotel and they would speak to the manager and contact me. That was 6pm Saturday night.

Sunday afternoon at 4 pm , I completed the class I was teaching all weekend at the hotel . Yet still had never heard from anyone to make sure I was ok, or offer even a piece of toast.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I was headed to Palo Alto for a conference at Stanford and after reading quite a few negative reviews of the "upscale" brand properties in the area, I decided to go with the Crowne Plaza and was pleasantly surprised. The staff is absolutely 5-star (much better than some of the world's priciest, premier properties). and the room was clean and functional. The restaurant was also good, with above average food quality and an excellent wait staff. Overall, I definitely felt like the staff went out of their way to make me feel at home. I would absolutely stay here again!< /text>

<user_id>None<//user_id><Review>that I booked them into your hotel to celebrate Mother's Day.
I booked two poolside rooms, one for the adults and one for the children.
One room was switched on me because both rooms were to have
an adjoining door between them but did not.

However, the children LOVED the pool and my son spent most of his time playing in the pool with them. A very healthy activity to share with your children.

When my son got back to San Luis Obispo, he notified me that he
left his iPad in his room. I notified the Cabana and Carman, the room cleaner, had brought the iPad to the Lost and Found of the hotel.
We were all so very appreciative of Carman's honesty.

Recently had our wedding here and also spent the entire wedding weekend here with family and friends. The staff was very helpful and treated us and all of our guest very well. They accommodated us in every way they can. The rooms are sweet. We personally booked two suites ourselves and both suites plus the presidential suite they gave us was amazing. Clean, comfy, and large enough for our wedding party to prep in.

The hotel is also a great venue for our big event. Large beautiful ballroom and the entire hotel features spaces that our guest enjoyed.

Definitely a hidden gem that I would recommend.</Text>

<Text>The staff was wonderful. They were always helpful. However, initially I was told I was being upgraded and the room was not what I had hoped for. However, they changed the room without any problem. But the room still did not meet the requests I have posted for my IHG membership, i.e. I always request an upper floor, but was placed on the second floor of a six or seven story hotel.
The hotel is beautiful.A car and driver are provided for going into town, which is nice because parking can be a problem in downtown Palo Alto.
The bar area is pleasant and relaxing.
The relaxation packet provided in the room is wonderful.
The rooms are loud. If you are facing the lobby you can hear dogs barking (in the lobby) and people chatting.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I cannot say enough about our stay. From the moment we pulled up and were greeted by the bellman everything just flowed. At every instance we were treated with silk gloves. When we found that our room had some excessive A/C roof top noise the front desk clerk did not blink an eye. He simply went on to see how he could accommodate us in a better location. At breakfast the manager went out of his way to assist us. We had been told that the cafeteria opened at 6:30 am when in fact it was 7:00 am. The manager brought us coffee, fruit, toast and cereal even though breakfast was not fully set up. Again, amazing staff, amazing place.< /Text>< name>

<Review>I have been staying at this property since December 2016 and from day one the staff has gone above and beyond for any request that I or my coworkers who have been staying since July of 2016. If there was anything that they either didn't know or had to clarify they made sure to get back to us. It's always been a pleasure dealing with the staff wether it was the front desk (Rose, Maritza) to the bar (Javier) all the way down to the shuttle driver (Steve). All of my stays have been without any complaints the rooms are cleaned daily the room service is quick along with the standard of food served in the restaurant/bar has been stellar. The only suggestion I have moving forward is that maybe the happy hour food menu or the full restaurant food menu could use a few new items. I have and will continue to encourage my coworkers to book at this location due to how well all the amenities and my experience has been thus far.</Review>< Name>

Being stricken with Cancer the MGR Rose went above and beyond to make my stay comfortably fit for a King. I was in getting a second opinion and also checking in on a project i started before my long journey with treatments. The entire staff at this hotel has touched my heart in many ways so when I beat this i will make it a point to come back and give each and everyone a hug from me.< /review>

Arrived 45 minutes after check in time to no room on bottom floir available. Rosa was wonderful and apologized. She assured me that there would be checkouts following day. Would be no problem to move us into first one vacated if i spoke with concierge. They were horrible, all day run around.

I was surprised at the decor and cleanliness of the property for the price. It was a great value in that sense. However, the front desk service was terrible. I needed to check in early at 2 PM (preferably earlier) because I had to attend an event at 3. I called a week before my stay to ask for early check in. They told me to call the night before my stay. I called the night before my stay and was told that there was a good chance I could get early check in because the hotel was only at 70% capacity, however, they told me I needed to call the next morning to be sure. I called the following morning and I explained my situation and they told me that there were no rooms available and to call back at 11 AM. I called back at 11 AM and they took my number and told me that they would give me a call when my room was ready. I arrived at 2 PM because I needed to drop my car off before the event (although it would've been nice to settle in and get ready in my room beforehand), and my room was indeed ready. However, I DID NOT GET A CALL FROM ANYONE. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.< /Text>

<Text>Only one problem kept this from an A  review.  The hotel chose to remodel the room next door while we were guests...lots of construction noise.  The hotel should have kept our room empty since the hotel wasn't booked solid, that would have created a buffer zone for the noise.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Public areas of the hotel were very beautiful and the staff was incredibly nice. My room was clean... but awkward. IE: The shower head was positioned so low on the wall that I had to get on my knees to wash my hair. It's like they redesigned the rooms at some point but put very little thought into it.</Text>

I thought the property looked really great. It appeared more expensive that the rates actually were. The staff was exceptional.

Found room service food for lunch was lukewarm...it was a grilled cheese. The staff person offered to return it but I accepted it. The breakfast I ordered was great.

I attended a group event. I found the food at the dinner was "airline food" with very dry chicken, bland salmon and unimaginative sides. The desserts were delicious.

Overall, an individual should find their stay very pleasant. A group might be disappointed in the food provided.

But no one will be disappointed in the comfort of the rooms and the customer service provided by the staff.< /review>

<Review>This hotel maybe good in the summer.  It was not great during my stay in January for the following reasons:
1. the door to my room was so drafty (the room is located in the side wing which is not enclosed) that I had to turn the heat way up;
2. the HVAC was noisy which ran all night for keep the room warm.

I should have requested a different room but I didn't have the time or energy when we leave the hotel before 7am for work and get back after 9pm for the 4 days.< /Review>< pics>

Stayed at the hotel with friends for a concert at Shoreline. The staff was excellent, the rooms were nice and the pool was great. We stayed by the pool all day until it was time to go to the show. The staff arranged for a taxi and off we went. The bar later that night was fun and lively. Finally, the beds were comfortable!<//text>

This is not our first stay at the Crowne Plaza, but we return here every time we are in the Bay Area because of the exceptional experience. The rooms are nicely appointed, the bathrooms are clean and up-to-date. The staff is friendly, efficient, and accommodating. The location is central and easy to get to. This trip wasn't actually to the Peninsula area itself (it was to San Francisco), but I elected to stay at the Crowne Plaza because of the value and the experience of this hotel. Even though we were visiting friends in San Francisco it was worth the 40-minute drive to our hotel in the evening. (I didn't find out until later that because of the events in SF this weekend, we might have had a difficult time finding accommodations there, anyway -- the Bay to Breakers race was on Sunday).</Review>

This hotel is nice and upscale. I usually get a cabana room near the pool each visit. Bartender is pleasant and good conversationalist as well as fellow guests. Request for arranged transportation was accommodated and exceeded expectation. My only complaint in the past was that I felt breakfast should be inclusive. However this time I was charged for parking and some of the room amenities/offerings were not there and when mentioned upon check out and got not even an apology. I will be considering another hotel in the area.</text>

The Crowne Plaza has done a good job of taking an old, dilapidated property and giving it a fresh new look. I stayed there for a class reunion and the front desk handled the influx of new people easily. The bar was great for a meet-up and the prices for drinks and hors d'oeuvres were reasonable. The location certainly is convenient.<//Text>

it was my last minute choice, so I checked in quite late and checked out next morning very earlier.  Comparing the experience I have had somewhere else, would like to see improvement on service policy which more favor to customer i.e. late check out, more professional staffs. etc.</Text>

Great place to stay for a couple of days if you are visiting Palo Alto. Hotel is close to everything yet the rate is lower than other places.

The room was extremely clean and the staff was extremely attentive. I recommend the Cabana room if you like to relax on the patio near the pool.</Review>

When I arrived, I was told that my room had been upgraded, and my request for a quiet room on a high floor (made when reserving) had been taken care of. (Top floor, furthest room from elevators and ice machines.)

I haven't stayed here in decades, but it was perfectly comfortable and included everything I needed.

Oh, one thing... There was a poster in the elevator saying "the Beatles stayed here in '63." That was a year before their first US tour, and two years before they stayed at the Cabana. Close but no cigar!

I stayed with my 3 children when they came to visit my youngest and I at Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital. It is very close to the hospital, the room was beautiful, very quiet. They upgraded us to a patio pool view, the kids and I got in the spa that night. Beds were comfortable and everyone at the hotel couldn't have been nicer. Also parking was right outside the room when you stay in the exterior part of the hotel.</review>

Open access areas recently refurbished,  good working areas.  Also reasonable small meeting room with soft furnishings,  but needs to be booked ($85/hr).  Beverage/food tablets available across the open access areas for ordering to bring direct to your seat.  Room was comfortable as always.<//Review>

<Text>We stayed here for two non-consecutive nights recently. Part of the hotel seems to be old and part is new.  The night that I paid for with points was in the old part of the hotel in the back of the property and the room needs updating. The night that I paid rack rate, we were in the front of the hotel and the room was very nice.  We had a good room service breakfast.</Text>< Rating>

<date>1449792000000</date><rating>None</rating><text>I stayed start of December and after a long flight from the UK , I had a warm welcome by valet even though I was not driving. Ended up arriving at the hotel around 4:30PM but when I walked in to reception it was freezing cold.....not stayed here before so not sure whether that is the normal but not the best frist impression. However the reception staff were great, big smiles and very helpful. I was a little shocked that the hotel being so quiet at that time I had to wait for my room? Little late in the afternoon to be waiting for a room but reception did offer me a drink at the bar which I duly accepted. The wait for the room was not that long but one thing I did notice while sitting in the bar is the resturant looking very soleless and like a canteen. I know it was 4:30 in the afternoon but even later when I returned to the bar at dinner time for a beer it still looked very unappealing, the food might be great though but I did not get to sample it as I was eating out during my stay.

My room was great very clean and a lovely view towards the hills at the back. It was quiet and I had some great nights sleep there. One thing that did bug me was the noise from the aircon even though it was turned off....thank god for earplugs! Room was clean (not sure about the furniture though) and the house keeping staff again were polite and always said good morning with a smile. The bar was ok but cold (temprature) and a little expenive. Javier who worked a couple of nights I was there was a great guy and happy to serve and have a chat....always helps when travelling on your own. One person that did keep appearing in differents areas was Tony. I first met him when he brought my bags to my room, then he appeared in reception, then behind the bar.....lovely chap and very helpful! Lastly thanks to the young man drinving the "little pick me up" for taking me up to Stamford Mall and back again....shame it was an expensive visit.

Good hotel, great staff and will be back again.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>We had a lovely stay at this hotel. We had to drive to Palo Alto from San Francisco under stressful circumstances, as we could not find a hotel anywhere in the city or the peninsula. Once we got there though, it was lovely. Pool was fantastic for the kids. Rooms were roomy and well appointed. That night, there were some disturbances from other guests. The next morning, when my husband checked out (he had not commented on the noise- which was brief), the desk said they were very sorry about the situation and comped one of our rooms. We found this to be very proactive approach for customer service. Absolutely appreciated it, and will go out of our way to find a Crowne Plaza in our future travels. Coincidentally, we also stayed in a Holiday Inn Express in Santa Cruz, and found the service there to be excellent as well. Thank you!</text></record></dataset><record>

Love this hotel, and the service but the public areas pre-function space and ballroom and corridors on guest rooms floors were way too cold . Probably around 63-64 degrees and wasted energy. Hard to adjust temperature satisfactorily on the room and it was noisy when it switched itself on and off.<//review>

<review>Stayed at the Crown Plaza in Palo Alto for a reunion. Accommodations were excellent; the room was very clean and had all the amenities one would expect.

Our event for 150 went off-like clockwork. Dinner was delicious, with several great options. Great banquet and bar staff, and front desk staff as well.

Convenient location for a large group.</review><user>None<//user><Response>None<//Response><Rate>None</Rate></record>

<user_name>William68< /user_name><text>Reservation was made in person at the front desk the day before the stay.
Reservation email confirmation indicated the wrong date and wrong number of persons in the party.
Upon my call back the accommodations were corrected and a new confirmation emailed.
Upon arrival I found that two rooms were reserved for me contrary to the revised confirmation.
I was informed that breakfast the following morning was included but upon arrival at the in house restaurant that " according to my room number" there was a $17.00 per person charge for breakfast.

During our stay the tv remote was working intermittently and needs new batteries. This deficiency was reported to two staff members by never acted upon.</text>< userid>

<text>Five stars for the service alone! Stayed here for several weeks for work and found the rooms very pleasant, well appointed and comfortable. More than that, I had ample time to get acquainted with the staff and every staff member I encountered was incredibly kind, helpful and went above and beyond. They also had nice events to make the stay a bit more enjoyable, like a weekly Off the Grid food truck event in the parking lot, free wine and cheese happy hours with drink coupons for the bar, and so on.< /text><userid>113234218091629132392< /userid><Resp>None<//Resp><date>1440564188465< /date><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091</Gmap_id><Name>Monica Lowe</Name><rate>5</rate>< Pictures>

We found the Crowne Plaza, Palo Alto to be an excellent base for our 2-week stay.
The shuttle service provided for the vicinity of Palo Alto and the Stanford campus was really helpful, and the two drivers were always punctual and helpful.
The con ditions in our room were comfortable, the bed excellent and the view inspiring.< /review>

This is not the first time that I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza and so I knew what to expect, and it did live up to expectations. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly. I really like the free shuttle service. Breakfast is okay, but could do with some more variety. I enjoy the dinner menu but I don't think this has changed since my last 6 months ago.<//review>

Check-in staff ignored to my room preference request at check in. Subsequently, had to involve manager. Moved to room that met my security preferences, but new room did not have TV! Had to move rooms again. Room missing in-room service menu. Took four calls to reach room service staff and order dinner.

Most rooms have doors to the outside of hotel.<//Text>

I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this hotel. It is reasonably priced, is in a great location, has excellent accommodations and a friendly and helpful staff. My only issue was the fact that the water was extremely slow to heat up, we had to run the water for say 3 to 5 minutes before we could even be able to shower. Not a huge deal, I just didn't to run the water unnecessarily . Other than that, I thought it was a great experience</review>

This hotel's location was centrally located for my business trip. It was good to see that the hotel had a restaurant onsite; however, since I had a vehicle, I was inclined to explore other eating venues. The room was quite spacious and had a refrigerator; however, no microwave,  but that was ok for my short stay.   I did find it awkward not to have a safe in the room,  so I opted for no cleaning service during my short stay as well and had to carry everything with me,  which made my handbag a bit heavier than expected.   

Overall,  good stay,  but cost of room was quite expensive considering there was no executive floor or complimentary breakfast or evening reception.</Review>

<Time>1386374400000< /Time><Rate>None< /Rate><text>I have stayed at this property once or twice a month for the last 2 years and have always had an excellent stay. They are always accommodating to my requests (inside tower room, early check in, quiet floor), recognize me by name, provide free drink and breakfast coupons, upgrade my room type (as high as the several room suites free of charge), provide a free shuttle within a certain distance of the hotel, and the list goes on. During my last visit, I had arrived after a 13hr travel day - I was upgraded to an enormous suite, given a free drink and breakfast coupon and was left a plate of fresh fruit by the front office supervisor (Thanks Mr Khan!). The wireless internet is always free with excellent signal and the office/computer room is well stocked. The walls are well insulated so it is always quiet in my room - I never hear anything from adjoining rooms.
I have had to stay at the Sheraton Palo Alto when this property has been full and while the Sheraton has been extremely kind and welcoming (upgrading my rooms as well) and is closer to Stanford, the price is almost always higher and the Wifi is $10/day, which is really annoying and actually my biggest hangup about staying there.
The Crowne Plaza staff is fabulous and I look forward to my next stay; thanks to all at the Cabana!< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Hi 

I enjoy from my stay in the hotel for the weekend. 
very nice & quiet hotel.
I got a large room outside near to the pool as I requested.
The room was clean but there a need to improve a little (example should be clean also under the bed ... )

Thanks the staff that was a kind and helpfull</review><Rate>None</Rate><UserId.>None< /UserId.>< name>

<text>We chose this hotel specifically for the hot tub. When we checked in, we told the front desk clerk this. He never said anything about the hot tub being closed for renovation. We went out and bought swimsuits for the 4 of us, got back to the room, and changed. We went down to the pool area and it was closed. When we went to the desk to talk about it, the new clerk was apologetic and said it was not the first time he had done that. That is unacceptable, even more so when you realize that he has done it multiple times with no consequences. That hot tub had been closed for weeks, and there was no way that the front desk could not have known.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

< review>
I'll start with the not so great but please read the whole review. The not so great: the "poolside rooms" are a bit poorly maintained and outdated motel style rooms behind the main hotel. I booked this through my employers travel agency for a premium price per night so I expected a nice room but was not happy with the poolside room I was given. Now for the good: I did a quick Google and realized that I could in fact get the king suite in the tower for $5 more per night. I called the front desk and discussed my disappointment in my first room and they listened and apologized. Sadly the hotel was fully booked that night. Now for the amazing: I was staying there for 4 nights and on day 2 they transferred me into the king suite without giving me any guff or making me feel guilty in any way. They even sent a guy to move my bags over for me. They were so very nice and the new room is hands down my favorite hotel room I have ever had. It has a huge bedroom, a living room, and a deck with mountain views. Just outstanding. I am a service stickler and I would absolutely stay here again and again. Good work crowne!<//review>

Crowne Plaza Hotel Palo Alto hit the mark for me as a well-run Hotel with very friendly staff and a safe, clean, slightly Bohemian feel that sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill corporate hotels where everything looks the same. The courtyard and pool in the rear are delightful, as are the large rooms with very good air temperature/quality and low ambient noise. I feel comfortable recommending the Palo Alto Crowne Plaza Hotel to my friends.</review>

We enjoyed our stay at the Palo Alto hotel. Very courteous staff. The breakfast waitress was a little slow for our order and giving our bill but overall we had an enjoyable stay. I would recommend this hotel. We were travelling with our two children and the pool and spa was enjoyed by all.< /Review>

Stayed at hotel for a week. Bed was very comfortable which is always the main focus of any hotel stay. Rest of the room was more than adequate - even if the wardrobe was in the bathroom. Plenty of built in USB chargers too which was nice when going abroad and means no worries over plug sockets. My refrigerator wasn't on at arrival but a quick visit to reception had that solved within an hour. The restaurant is good but basic. Nothing but standard fare on offer.<//Review>

The rooms and facilities were very comfortable and clean. But the staff seemed very confused about the terms of my reservation and those of my companions. Our reservations were supposed to include complimentary breakfast, but sometimes that was honored and other times not. If we asked two different staff or managers, we got two different answers depending on whether they were the evening staff or the morning staff. A consistent story would heve been appreciated.</text>

This hotel was not my first choice, but I am glad I stayed. I arrived late, and the staff was pleasant and accommodating. There was happy hour in the lobby, which was a welcome site.
I would recommend a free breakfast or continental to compete in the Palo Alto Area. Too  many other hotels offer free breakfast with a lower room rate.<//text>

First they sent me to a room that was already occupied. Oops.

Then they upgraded me to a suite, which sounds great, but really wasn't. The HVAC in the suite was only blowing hot air, so it was about 80 in the room.

Yes, I called to get it fixed, and they sent someone up and said it was fixed. Nope, it wasn't. By that time I just needed to sleep. So to remedy this I opened the patio door, and yes, I slept so that anyone with access to the partitioned but shared balcony (that is, 6 other rooms) could have climbed into my room. That didn't happen. But it did cool down.</review>

<review>Carpets look like from the 70's and the overall feel of the hotel is like a time-travel to the 80s.
Highly overpriced compared to other hotels in the area offering a better experience.
Aircondition is very loud, the big TV does not fit the overall room layout, and parking costs 12 USD which is a joke.</review>< Pictures>

I have stayed here 6-8 times and I would say it is a mixed bag. When you get a room in the main building the rooms are pretty nice and recently renovated, but rooms in the back and front wings are a bit dated. The room I had earlier this week was really musty when I walked in. Later I noticed black mold growing all over the ceiling. I requested a new room the next morning and the staff was very apologetic and quickly remedied the situation. Staff seems very nice.<//text>

The hotel was sold out and had a lot of preteens there for some kind of event but it never stopped the service and attention to detail. We had a little bit of a long wait to check-in but the person at the counter was very apologetic and kept telling us they will be right with us. When we finally made it to the desk they again apologized and offered us water. The water came in handy as it was a smoldering day. After a few room changes we arrived back to a lovely note from Charles welcoming us to the hotel and apologizing once more for the delayed check in time. When we went to the desk to thank him we saw him running around to help other guests and staff so we talked to the lady host. She was nice and listened to us and we begin a conversation on my outfit that she loved because of its color. 
Everyone at this motel had smiles and stopped to ask how we were doing. I felt like the red carpet was rolled out for us.< /review>

I recently attended a conference in Palo Alto at Stanford University, and stayed at this hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was great. Stay was a little pricey, including extra for parking, but I'm not sure there's much better in the area for less money.

The hotel has a bar and restaurant that I used. Service was good in both. The hotel has a pool, but I did not use that. There is also a courtesy shuttle to take you to points of interests.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel, provided it fits within your budget.<//Review>

<review>when I checked in I wasn't acknowledged as a platinum member and was not offered a welcome amenity.  the key stay preference I submitted was a room away from the elevator and my room was the first room as you stepped out of the elevator. my room wasn't serviced the first day (I left at 9 am, and returned at 9 pm, the do not disturb sign was NOT on).  when I told reception the next morning, they didn't even apologize.  They were pretty dismissive.  The next day the room was serviced but my tea wasn't replenished in the room.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>The staff was friendly and helpful, and the room was very nice, clean and comfortable. Even though the price of everything in the bay area is ridiculously inflated, it is just hard to feel that a hotel is a good value when you pay that much per night and the parking and breakfast buffet cost extra on top of that.< /review><GmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//GmapID></record>

< review>
Stayed five nights for work and I've never been so happy to leave a hotel. It was 30 degrees Fahrenheit outside and my room was icy cold. After fighting with the heater all night (and not sleeping) thinking it was just my room I called and was told the broiler for part of the hotel was broken and no ETA on a fix and was given an extra blanket. I find out the next day from co-workers staying at the hotel there were space heaters available (no one offered me one) - some people even had two or three in their room. So I called the second night and was told one would be brought up. I waited quite a few hours and called again, I got a very un-inspired "sorry we ran out" with a promise to have one the next day. When I got back to my room after a long day I thankfully had one. The bathroom was still frozen but at least the bed area was warm enough to sleep.

Other than that the front desk staff was generally lackluster (one exception was when I checked in). The rest of the hotel was mostly freezing (we were meeting in rooms there and many had to wear coats).

The only bright spots was housekeeping, who did a great job, and the staff at the dining area. Maybe they should be running the place.< /review>

had meeting nearby, this hotel was convenient.  $12 parking per day is a bit of a ripoff.  valet guy in front was more concerned with checking his phone than making eye contact or saying hello.  room was old but had modern touches, overall it was decent but nothing to write home about.  You'd think for the price they would throw in a free breakfast but you'd be wrong.<//review>

The room was on the first floor but it was different than other hotels because it was down a long courtyard. There was parking right by the rooms so that was very convenient. Lighting was a bit dim in the room but it was nice to open the doors which faced the pool. Overall a pretty good and unique hotel experience.< /review>

The staff, especially Hristo Baramov, were SO HELPFUL with the events leading up to my son's wedding, which was up in the redwoods above Palo Alto. I entertained my out of town guest very nicely in one of the function rooms off the lobby.  The renovations going on in the lobby did take away from the ambience of the place, though.</Review>

I was quoted 3 different prices, 3 different times I called to find out the price. The room rates change depending on how much they can get away with charging you. Night 2 was 2x the cost of night 1.
The room was not cleaned properly each day. Coffee was not re-stocked.
On night 1, I called the front desk and asked when quiet hours were (my room was near the pool and guests were being quite loud when I was trying to sleep). The response "oh, be as loud as you want until 11pm!" I responded that I was trying to sleep and was wondering when the guests had to STOP be loud!

My husband and I booked a 3 night stay for Stanford Parent's Weekend and were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the Cabana Suite. The room and balcony were very spacious. The bed was very comfortable. All of the staff, were very friendly. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel and plan to visit again.</text>

<review>At first, as I looked for my room around the back of the hotel, I thought I was going to be disappointed, but upon entry, I found the room clean and well decorated. The huge bathroom housed a large closet that contained 2 suitcase stands (I don't think I've ever had 2 stands in 1 room); extra pillows and blankets - and all the normal amenities. The bathroom had 2 frosted glass panels that allowed a bit of light to shine through to the main part of the room. I loved the high back guest chair.
We stayed at the hotel due to the wedding of a friend - and the ceremony and reception were beautiful! Staff was helpful and friendly. The only hitch to the wedding ceremony is that the silky runner they laid down on the stone tiles for the bride and her bridesmaids to walk down caused a slippery situation for the girls who all wore high heeled shoes. That was not well thought out! Otherwise, I would highly recommend the hotel!<//review><rate>None</rate>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I like the free area shuttle of this hotel, breakfast is pretty standard, not free. Food is not much choice for people that doesn't eat pork. Room is nice and clean with a refrigerator inside but has  no microwave. So I dont feel special here. I also see that mineral water is serve as complimentary just one day. Expensive hotel I think. But I love the shuttle. Thanks to the driver for the pleasant ride.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Muhammad Pahlevi< /user_name><resp>None<//resp>< rating>

Lovely hotel with very attentive staff.

Has a 24 hour gym and a decent restaurant.

Rooms are lovely/charming  and room service is fantastic as well.

Each room comes with complimentary sleep aids made from natural oils e.g lavender and eucalyptus.

They often hold small events such as a wine and cheese tasting.

Taxi's are readily available and can also be booked.

All in all a pleasant experience.

(Couldn't find a safe in the room however, which meant I wasn't inclined to leave valuables in the room)</Text>

<Text>Our family had a trip to Palo Alto for both business and vacation purposes.  We needed a safe, family friendly hotel that would serve both purposes, and be close to the Stanford campus. This location does that and is about 2.2 miles from campus.  Lots of great places to eat nearby, and close to Palo Alto and Los Altos also.</Text>< Name>

<Time>1377734400000< /Time><rate>None<//rate><text>I am really disappointed and upset that I had to encounter Richard from the front desk on my wedding morning.

Prior to my stay at the hotel, I called in to ask if it would be OK for me to have a late check out on my wedding day since my bridesmaids and I had to get ready. The person who answered my call assured me that it would not be a problem.

On the day of my wedding, I walked over to the front desk to remind them that I would be checking out a little later. I encountered Richard, told him it was my wedding day and that I would be checking out late. Not only did he roll his eyes at me, he told me that I should have planned better and that this would have been a huge problem. I told him that someone told me that it was OK, but he kept talking over me - telling me that it wasn't OK and kept repeating that I should've planned better. Then he said he would have to charge me for an extra half day (which was fine). The only thing that made me upset and brought me to tears was when he kept blaming me for poor planning when I clearly stated that I had called in prior to make sure checking out late wasn't a problem.

I just hope that this doesn't happen to other people...especially on their wedding day. His unprofessionalism, rudeness, insensitivity, and mean attitude is not what I expected from the Crowne Plaza and has reflected very poorly on the hotel. I'm just sad that this had to happen to me on my wedding day.<//text>< Pics>

We always love staying at the Crowne Plaza Palo Alto. All of the staff at the front desk were wonderfully friendly helpful and we were given a very nice room upgrade at check-in. The room was perfect and we could not have enjoyed our stay more. We spent some time in the lounge, where, again, everybody was friendly and fun to be around.<//text>

This my second time at this location. The hotel personnel were professional, friendly and very accommodating as to my needs for the hotel shuttle and other small requests. The room was clean and quiet and the bed very comfortable. The fruit and cookies at the front desk were also a plus. All in all, a great stay!</Review>

My stay was good in general, great staff, very friendly. The restaurant cook very good burgers, specially the mediterranean one.

During my stay I identified a few things to get fixed. The room door wasn't completely isolated, for that reason, in the morning I could always hear people talking out loud and kids running as If they were inside.

The wi-fi connection, indispensable to do my work, was disgraceful! Slow and facing intermittent disconnections during the 4 days I have been there. You must fix that! This is Sillicon Valey, internet is part of the basics.<//Text>

I have been using this hotel for some years. There is for sure an on-going problem regarding the quality of internet via wifi (plus, the cable in my room simply gave no connection). The wifi is often down for hours - the signal strength looks good, but the connection does not work.
I have colleagues who started with this hotel, but are migrating gradually to other hotels, largely due to this problem - we all must have reliable internet access to work efficiently.
This visit, I have been frustrated with the internet access, and embarrassed in front of colleagues who I brought to the hotel, just to find problems with the internet. Please, please, fix it.

My other point, which clearly is a matter of my own taste, is that the restaurant and bar area is looking a bit dark and sad. There are few or no customers there, which I guess confirms my impression. I think it probably needs to be brightened up, made lighter. The big pillar in the middle of the bar does not help.
Please, take these comments in the spirit intended.< /Text>

<review>We stayed at the Crowne Plaza following a very long and stressful day that followed surgery for our Granddaughter at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford. The staff checking us in was so caring and concerned. It made a lasting impression. The room was fabulous, and the night was restful.
Thank you so much! We will definitely return.</review>< resp>

Stayed two nights a Crown Plaza Palo Alto. Easy, quick and friendly check-in. Were part of a wedding party so we received a good block rate. After a long drive from British Columbia it was a wonderful surprise to get a room upgrade because of our IHG® Rewards Club Membership. Fabulous, spacious room with king size bed and a clean bathroom with toiletries, fluffy towels and gowns. Only snag: our room door had a problem locking when exiting but staff were on hand to make sure it was sorted out quickly and efficiently. Doors do need to be changed as they look worn out and old in comparison to the modern room decor. Didn't have time to use any of the facilities, but friends in our group had positive comments. A disappointingly short stay at a lovely hotel. If we ever find ourselves in Palo Alto again, we will definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza.< /review>

Big entrance, Lobby is impressive. The rooms are older but have been upgraded. Expensive for the area mid week is very high.
Pool area is nice and relaxing and the sports bar is cozy.

< Review>
Good Points - Hotel looks wonderful from the outside, nice lobby and staff are friendly. My room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. I had a suite with a view of the roof.

Negatives - there were several. Shuttle to Stanford was booked on the wrong day. We inquired as to the delay and told no problem they would be there any minute. 5 minutes later, the problem was discovered and we were late for our conference. 

Next plumbing issues. My bathroom had a great layout with 2 pedestal sinks. The pedestal sink on the left hand side, the cold faucet leaked. The right hand pedestal sink, the hot water faucet leaked. Last night of the stay, at approximately 3:45am I woke to the toilet cycling on and off. I discovered the toilet was slowly leaking. Needless to say, when I reported this, I was told it was a known intermittent problem and they would have a plumber look at it after I checked out. Since I had numerous towels, I tossed them on the floor to absorb the water and turned off the valve at the wall.< /Review>

The hotel is excellently located with impressive exterior welcome and lobby. The staff is also friendly, but that's where the good experience end.
I was given (without being asked for my preferences) a room on the entrance floor accessible from an outdoors walkway with large window/wall to the corridor - creating a very "motel" like experience where I needed to worry about the security of the room. The room was spacious with a great bed and pillow, but felt very dated with carpets, furniture and walls in a very dated color.
The heating/AC system made a very loud white noise even when turned off (I can't sleep with white noise) and the management "solved" it by adding an electric space heater.
They were training a new employee at check-in, but therefore failed to inform me I needed a parking pass (I got a courtesy note on my windshield the next day and could fix it), and they also failed to register my work credit card (a user error according to VISA), though another receptionist could fix that the next day.
I'm also an IHG Rewards Member, but the only thing I got for this was a note offering me a free drink or some points, and two small pieces of chocolate on my 2nd day (nothing when arriving, and nothing on the other days).
This hotel might seem impressive on the outside, but inside (at least in the room I was given) it feels much more like an expensive roadside highway motel.<//Text>

Came here for Sunday brunch on father's day... I was disappointed at the poor service.  People left and right were getting served coffee and champagne, while we got ignored.  I mentioned this to the server who apologized, then the same thing continued.  The food was good, but that really put a bad taste in my mouth.
Not sure I would want to experience that again...so, no return...<//Text>

<Review>Your experience will be based on who is working at the front desk and what room you have been assigned.

A few bright spots....the property is very nice inside and out....the poor area being exceptional, with the outsourced Bar / Restaurant being an excellent addition. The Exec Sales team is stellar and if you are looking to hold a company function at this property, I have no doubt you'll be mostly pleased.

A few blights....the front desk staff is mostly cordial, but are we going to settle for cordial? It would ideal for the team to go above and beyond the norm, but this was not to be during this stay.

A few oh wow....while the decor and cleanliness of the rooms is spot on, the cement like bed and feather pillows that sorely need refreshing, are enough to limit sleep to 1-2 hours a night. Add in what feels / sounds like constant walking on the 2nd level and you're in for a long night.<//Review>< pics>

The service at the front desk was mediocre. I travel frequently and they were not very professional or kind. I was staying for a special romantic Getaway night with my husband and never did they ask about my accommodations. Also there was no continental breakfast. When I stay at the Holiday inn for business they always have breakfast for those who stay in their hotel. I also had to ask for my parking voucher. And when I was given drinking vouchers I ordered from the bartender when out of nowhere a manager came by and addressed the bartender no those drinks are not covered without even a sorry or word to me and my husband!<//text>

The hotel is conveniently located, and looks great from the outside. However, the rooms, especially on the Ground Floor, are extremely damp, and hence a big problem if you have allergies. I found the front desk to be extremely unhelpful in this regard, as they outrightly claimed there was no problem even and that they did not have a single other room available, both of which were proven wrong within 15 minutes of intervention by the hotel Manager. Overall, I found the situation was handles very poorly, and given the host of great hotel options close by, would not recommend this one unless everyone else is booked!< /Review>

Large, clean rooms. Friendly staff. Heard about a free happy hour but didn't take part myself. Knocked off a star for the restaurant. Ordered a fruit and yogurt plate and got a thimble full of yogurt and an entire fruit platter. Frankly bizarre. They were very accommodating one morning when I was in a rush, however, and brought me over a quick bagel. Overall a nice place and I would definitely stay here again.< /text>

<review>This hotel is located close to Stanford University and other local area businesses that I visit on a regular basis, so it makes the choice a very pleasant and easy one. Staff is friendly, rooms are clean and bathrooms have been obviously renovated. For Platinum members I would suggest the hotel chain to provide a complimentary buffet breakfast to increase the loyalty. Fitness are would need to be larger with newer equipment - they are outdated. Internet speed could be faster, but it gets email work done. For streaming purposes it's not fast enough. My overall experience is good, but improvements are needed to step up one notch in the tough market for pleasing business and leisure travelers.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I was in town for an interview, and went down to the restaurant to quickly grab a banana. I realized I didn't have a hair clip for the interview, so I asked for the nearest place I could buy one......Julie, an employee, took her hair claw out of her hair, and gave it to me!!!! Then another waitress, ran to the back and quickly grabbed me a banana to go! They were awesome! ...and I really appreciated their effortts! Julie, told me to keep it, but I said I would take it back. Unfortunately, I didn't remember to take it back til I was flying out! ....I'll try to remember when I return!< /Review>

Came here with the fam, there is not a changing table in the men's bathroom which is pretty wack, come on y'all it's 2018. Pool area is nice the overall Cabana thing works but for $400 a night imma need better and more comfortable seating in all the rooms. They sacrifice comfort for design and style, but it's not uncomfortable. Staff is friendly and courteous and was generally attentive.</review>

<Text>The staff were very helpful to myself and my bridal party. We had 7 rooms and often many questions, but all issues were resolved and questions were answered quickly. The shuttle was a great service to get us between the Rehearsal dinner and back to the hotel safely and punctually.< /Text>< Rating>

<Text>If you're looking for a hotel room with a clean lobby, nice staff, and decent restaurant food then look no further.

However, the beds are as comfortable as sleeping in a public pool area. The sheets were damp (hopefully from the laundry room) and you could bounce a truck on the mattress (ridiculously hard).

Now, too dress up the room and give it a cool vintage, distressed look the wall paper was peeling away in several spots.

Oh and rumor has it that the free coffee in the lobby is no longer being offered to help you recover from the terrible nights sleep.

I'm glad my stay was only for two nights.<//Text>< pictures>

It was not at all a good experience, breakfast is not included for a room rate of $300, and even the room size is very small compared to any other group of hotels of same class. I don't recommend people here .</review>

<Rating>None<//Rating><text>Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by Crown Plaza's friendly and most helpful staff. Although we noticed some renovations taken place this did not interfere with our stay.
The property is well maintained and our room was very comfortable. We had a small problem with the heater in the living room area that was immediately taken care of by the friendly on-call maintenance staff. .
This hotel sets back off El Camino Real and is close to restaurants, shopping malls, Stanford University, Stanford Hospital and VA Palo Alto.
We had excellent service while dining but was served burned bacon and toast with a smile. If we had brought it to their attention this would have been taken care of however, it is very hard to complain when people are so nice. The restaurant manager was very kind and friendly and made our stay enjoyable..
We must say service was exceptional.and we plan to return to this hotel in the future.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The hotel looks nice and is generally in pretty good shape.  Our room was pretty old and not the cleanest.  The fire sprinkler nozzle was coming out of the ceiling, there were cobwebs in the bathroom and in the room by the window. Worse was someone in the hotel was smoking and set off the premise wide fire alar.<//Review>

<review>Hotel is definitely older but service makes up for lack of decor. The front desk was inviting as well as the people who manned breakfast, and the woman who helped me get my free appetizers (redeemed from checking in on Yelp). I definitely felt like a guest here.

My room was facing the street and the walls are thin (I could hear when the guest next door was fidgeting with his keys and listening to music). The other things I was disappointed about was that I saw that they had charged my credit card for 2 nights stay (when it had already been paid for by the company). Good thing I caught it on my credit card statement and am currently waiting for it to be reversed on my card....

Everyone does seem to rave about the buffet (during the weekends?) and I have to say that I had a good breakfast experience as it was a buffet and they had ample things to choose from.</review>< Pics>

We were hesitant to book this hotel since it is a bit farther from Stanford than previous hotels where we stayed. However, the drive onto campus was acceptable (10 min) and the wonderful staff and resort-like feel of the property was a huge bonus. We all really enjoyed the complimentary bikes and the food trucks that set up in the parking lot on Monday night.<//Text>

Staff: Staff and service were generally excellent, with the exception of problems picking up room service trays.
Breakfast manager in particular was very attentive and welcoming.

Facilities: Room walls are paper thin and I could clearly hear every conversation and cough of my neighbors. Gym is tiny, poorly laid out, with antiquated equipment. Back half of the hotel has the rooms open directly onto the parking lot like some 1950's motel (which lets wildlife feast on room service trays that were ignored).< /Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Not as nice as last time.   The front desk people were nice enough although, the room was a little disappointing. I didn't realize most of following untit midnight, therefore it was too late to contact the front desk.  First, thing that happened was when I was on a conference call to Hawaii.  I had my phone plugged in because it was a lengthy call next thing I knew my phone went dead.  That's how I discovered the outlets on the lamp next to the bed do not work.    Second, the refrigerator didn't work.  I have put some medication in there that needed to stay cold and about midnight realized it wasn't working. I had to get dressed and go get ice.  Lastly,  I go to lay down on the bed there's a big dip (hole) where people have laid before.   A big hump in the middle of the bed, don't they rotate these?  I couldn't believe it when you pay $200 a night for a room I would expect the facilities inside of it to work.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Rating>None<//Rating><Review>I booked a two night stay on my wedding weekend. We were
Married in the backyard of the house I grew up in Palo Alto, and the cabana is just around the corner. We had a king size bed next to the pool. The room was just fine, we spent almost no time at the hotel, as we were very busy but the bed was comfy and the shower was good.

I was slightly disappointed with one thing, when I checked in I mentioned I was getting married Saturday night, I was hoping to get some suggestions about surprising my bride with rose peddles or something romantic. I asked the person checking me in if they do anything like that, and he handed me a menu to order chocolate covered strawberries, which would have been nice, except I forgot.

I guess that's my fault, all in all it was a good stay, and I would come back.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091<//Gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1376611200000< /time></record>

Front desk staff needs to be further trained to pay attention to details and know what is going on in their workplace.
Temperature in room and meeting room was in the 60s and could not be adjusted! I was warmer outside.
Food was not very good especially for the price; I ate elsewhere.
Room was okay with a view of the roof.
Bathroom was great with a tub that worked.< /Text>

We really enjoyed our stay and wish we could have taken advantage of more hotel amenities. While checking rates in the area, the Crowne Plaza far exceeded what was offered elsewhere. Location was very convenient to Palo Alto VA Hospital. Will definitely stay again when back in the area.</Review>

The front desk at the check in was not good - no smile, no nice tone of voice. It was uncomfortable experience.  Room was small and outdated.  It was a little strange location.

Room was very nice and clean. Couldn't get the makeup mirror light to come on. Had dinner downstairs the food was good and the service was excellent. The room service for breakfast was very good and right on time.

The desk staff at this hotel is simply AMAZING!!! The gentleman at check-in went out of his way to ensure that all of my needs were taken care of. Because of him I will return in a month.<//Text>

<Time>1411948800000<//Time><Rate>None< /Rate><UserId.>None</UserId.><Text>Hotel room was run down, with mismatched and scuffed up furniture. Closet is inside bathroom, and doors to closet and bathroom get tangled up easily. No safe in the room. Bright security light shone in our window all night, making the room too bright for sleeping. Fridge in room is noisy and comes on frequently around the clock, as does the noisy AC. Not enough towel bars in the bathroom. Shower floor is slippery and slopes sharply down to the shower drain, making it a bit dangerous. Breakfast area was understaffed and not clean, and service was poor. Not a great selection at breakfast buffet. Pool area was large and lovely--the only thing we can praise about our stay, along with the friendliness of the banquet servers at our event.</Text>< gmapID>

<text>Staff was very nice and our bed was good. We used the restaurant a few times and the food was quite nice. My chief complaint was the shower...I couldn't even wash my hair because the pressure in the shower was so pathetic. If I HAVE to come to Palo Alto again, I would probably stay there, but the showers just have to be improved. I know California should always be in conservation mode (I worked for a major water utility), but this was absurdly unpleasant.< /text>< pics>

The bar serves drinks in plastic for poolside, and it was great to beat the heat of the weekend and stay in air-conditioned room and use the pool!<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<Date>1384819200000< /Date><review>I stayed at Crowne Plaza while attending a conference. The hotel is situated between silicon valley and Stanford university. Hence, plenty of thing to see. The public transport is relatively close, bus stops at the door, Caltrain is 15 minutes walk (San Antonio station). Hotel provide a shuttle that takes to to 5 mile radius for free which is superb.
The food at the hotel is sensational. I really engoyed it. There are also Chillie's, two Starbucks and other food retailers in close proximity.
The hotel was relatively old, but very clean and the room look as new. Staff were very helpful and kind too. :-)
Overall will recommend to everyone travelling to Palo Alto.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><username>Iman123</username><userid>None< /userid>< GmapID>

Clean, comfortable and convenient, although the car parking arrangements can be confusing for a hotel with so much parking capacity. The staff are friendly and have always offered great service in the 20  times I've stayed. Definitely my first choice in the area< /Text>

I never reviewed hotels in the past. However, Crowne Plaza Palo Alto is great. Rooms are very clean, spacious and well-designed. Hotel staff was very helpful and reached out to me to arrange for my wallet to be returned after I left it in a cab. Importantly, they reached out after I checked out. Five stars!< /text>

<review>My bill was under my door prior to check out, but I had breakfast that morning (~7AM). 2 hours later I departed the hotel, but stopped at the front desk to ask for my updated bill including my breakfast charge. The bill was not ready. I was asked if the hotel could email me my final bill. I provided my email to the clerk twice. After 5 days, I have still not received my bill. I had to call the front desk again, provide my email address again and hopefully I will not receive my bill.< /review>< Pics>

Solid hotel for the working stiff who is traveling on business. Comfortable rooms with a good range of sensible amenities and tons of outlets for nerds. Free internet speeds are decent and upgrades are available for reasonable rates. Staff is friendly and helpful. I'm not the type to run events at hotels so I don't know that side of things well but the ballroom-type event I acrually attended at the Crowne Plaza went off without a hitch thanks to the excellent staff.<//Text>

I got a very cheap rate because of a bat mitzvah I was attending, but would rather pay the extra $50/night to stay somewhere else next time.  The building is pretty bad (at least on the floor where I stayed) and the random sets of short stairs everywhere are a total pain when you have luggage.  And no one was there to help me when I arrived, so I had to navigate three suitcases myself through a bunch of random stairs and doors.  Staff were friendly when I did speak with them, and the pool is really excellent.< /Text>

The hotel standard has really deteriorated. I have stayed close to a dozen times here over the last two years and in the last six months or so I have seen a real decay in standards. From the restaurant to the front desk to housekeeping, the hotel seems to be managed by a bunch of amateurs who seem to be going through the motions rather than exhibit any sort of passion towards genuine customer service. Toiletries are routinely not replaced, number of towels are three one day and two on a different day, restaurant serves coffee but there is no milk or sugar on the table, people like Marcus(?) in the restaurant serve you as if they are doing a huge favour, hiss at you  if you ask for vegetarian options (he actually said “I will do it once but don’t ask again”), front desk don’t even bother asking how the stay was at the time of checkout. There are countless things I noticed. What a shame. Just two years back this hotel was a genuine gem. It had people like Gloria in the restaurant and Tiffany in the front desk who went out g their way to make guests feel valued and special. For the price this hotel charges, guests should rightly expect much more.</Review>

Initial hotel room had no proper windows and was next to the airco Outlet causing a massive humming noise 24/7. In addition, power outlets were not working, power strips and cables were  sprawling all over the floor and the room had torn and stripped wallpaper all over the place, in addition to no proper room lighting except for a table lamp. the whole place felt cramped and tiny. 

Fortunately I requested to be moved due to the humming noise, but unfortunately that didn't resolve the noise issue as the AC vents themselves were generating a constant noise even when turned off. Room quality was a bit better but considering the price I'm not sure if I'd stay here again.< /Text>

I was situated in the Cabana rooms. These are located out on the wings of the hotels and in my case on the 2nd floor not far from the front desk.

The good:
The room itself was nicely furnished, clean and very roomy.
Staff was pleasant and desk was staffed to minimize wait times
Located close to Silicon Valley

The not so good:
My room was not well soundproofed and at this price point, I expect better. I could hear voices and doors slamming late into the night, waking several times as a result. My neighbor was suffering some sort of bad cough that sounded as though he was in my bathroom.
Breakfast. All in, I added $19 onto my stay for reconstituted eggs, coffee and a sausage link. This same money would have netted a nice breakfast elsewhere and in truth, I've had as good or better complimentary breakfast fare in competitor hotels.</text>

We were pleasantly surprised by this lovely hotel. Our visit was great from the moment we arrived. The rooms were clean, comfortable, nicely appointed and quiet. The morning coffee was delicious and all in all, we were thrilled. I highly recommend this terrific hotel.</Review>

Comfortable, clean rooms. Monday night there are food trucks in the parking lot which was a fun experience.
Cons are the additional charge for parking ($12 self park, $15 valet) Overall, I would stay here again.<//Review>

From front desk check in, to restaurant waitstaff, it was as if they knew people would book their stay here because of the central location and they didn’t take pride in their work, attitude or customer service.

Fortunately I was able to find a room at Crowne Plaza. However, I searched over eight (8) hotels before I was able to find one that could meet the needs of my sister. I don't see the issue of having more handicapped-access rooms available. It would not present as much of a problem if able-bodied guests had to stay in a handicapped-access room. However, the handicap do not have the same option. It would be so beneficial for there to be more than 1 or 2 room available.</text>

We booked the Cyprus Room and the attached Sun Deck. They put a stage in for our band and a dance floor. Catering was good and we had a cash bar on the deck.

The overall hotel is very good, beautiful pool area!
STaff was excellent!

Room: very clean and spacious, but two things need to be improved:
1) the mattress was uncomfortable - put in pillowtops!
3) the air vent system was terribly noisy, whistling, clunking. Kept waking me up every time the ac turned on.<//review>< Name>

They could not fine my reservations, when they did i got a sorry ma'am, did not have us on the list for breakfast... then charged me for to night, i was only there for one. And now the extra $360 they took out will take a week to get back to me. Oh and the valet told me to drive around tell a spot opened up, when we first got in.< /text>

<Text>I spent 3 nights at this property. The rooms have nothing special.

First night I got to the room, after midnight, the heat is not working. Someone from the staff comes into the room and since there's a technical issue, they move me to a nicer room (larger). He checks the heat and says that it will take some time before the heat starts working and leaves the room promising that it will work.
20 minutes after, already after 1am, the heat is not working and I'm cold in the room. I decide to go to bed since it's already too late.

The next morning, I ask at the front desk to have the heat checked. When I come back to the room after a few meetings, the room is empty and my clothes are not there. I run back to the front desk and I am told that I have been moved to another room (WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!). The new room was smaller.< /Text>< Pics>

A very sensible choice of hotel, with a reasonable price, for the area. There is nothing here to dislike and a great deal to feel smug about given the price other hotels are charging nearby. The property and rooms are well maintained and comfortable. The staff are helpful and efficient. Wifi and parking were free, and there was a free shuttle service to the local area (which was not well advertised, but could be arranged from the front desk.)
If you pre-pay for breakfast, we found the 9 am cut-off time for the inclusive buffet far too early - we didn't make it once (who wants to rush to breakfast every morning when on vacation!). There was no refund for our unused vouchers and we were not told the timings on check-in. Aside from that, and the air-conditioning in the room which some might find a tad feeble, a very pleasing stay.< /text>

Very average rooms, but very expensive (like anything in Palo Alto). Since the demand for hotel rooms in bay area is so high, the hotels really don't care about price/performance. Too expensive for the old (but big) rooms.< /Text>

I spent a few nights here recently on a business trip.
- Room was spacious, well-appointed and ambient noise from other rooms was not too loud or distracting
- Amenities were well-equipped and adequate for hotel traffic
- Location was great for tech company campuses as well as close to Stanford campus
- Parking was plentiful and traffic light at hotel entrance/exit made it easy to get onto El Camino Real during rush hour<//text>

<Review>Hotel is nice enough For price and location stayed in one of there less expensive rooms wall paper was bubbling in several places. the location is great lot of space for different get together. Nice pool helpful staff, except for the restaurant down stairs. Ordered Al last carte breakfast, ordered fairly quickly didn't get water till 20 mins later. Did not see our waitress until our food came 30 mins after we ordered and it was not busy. Saw several people standing around trying to figure out if they should wait to be seated or grab a seat hostess was gone majority of the time most people just walked away 2 groups had to actually walk in the the restaurant and wave staff down to ask for direction. We all ordered eggs not worth the money spent.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

We stayed a few days after Christmas and it was fantastic. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The front desk surprised us with an upgrade to a suite and it was beautiful. When we asked for a late check out they said no problem. I can say nothing but good things. We will return soon.</Text>

We live under 10 miles away, but this is a great place for a great summer getaway weekend by the pool, where you can get good food and drinks delivered poolside.<//Review>

I had a 3 week trip to Palo Alto starting in January. I switched to the Crowne Plaza for the 2nd and 3rd weeks and I'm glad I did. Food Truck Monday and great rooms made my stay very easy. and... the Beatles stayed there on the 8th floor.< /review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>We checked in on a Thursday night. Our reservation had requested a room by the pool. We asked the person at the desk to look up our rewards number and she said she needed our address even though it was in the reservation. (Opportunity to think on her own.) The room key didn't work because the lock was broken or something. She called maintenance and asked them about any work being done in the room instead of moving us immediately. (Not the best thing to do in front of a guest.) We were then moved to another room but not told that it had 2 beds. We went back to ask for a room with 1 bed since that is what we reserved and wanted. Manager was called and moved us to a room with 1 bed. We weren't told it was a handicap accessible room. The shower came to our chin so we had to bend down to get our heads wet. No space in the bathroom to leave your toothbrush nor to hang your towel when you were done. Tried to order room service. They told us they'd have someone call us back. Several minutes later they called back to take the order. They got our order wrong and only sent up 1 order. The chicken was dry, overcooked and only slightly warm. The fries were cold. The air-conditioning in the room never got the room cold so we woke up sweating. We decided to check out the next morning only to be told that we would get charged a fee for early departure. As we told the staff member the problems we encountered, she said 'I do apologize' as though she was trained to just say it and not mean it. She then said I would have to wait to speak to her manager because he was in a meeting. I suggested she get him out of the meeting. The manager did try to help us but unfortunately his staff was incapable of thinking on their own and he made some poor decisions about our stay. We never got credit for the money we spent on our rewards either which adds to the frustration since we did have to pay despite all of the trouble. Overall it was a very bad experience after a 6 hour cross country flight.<//review><Response>None</Response></record>

< Review>
When I arrived the room was really inviting. I had a comfortable sleep. I went to work. I came back and noticed the room was unacceptable, first the do not disturb was on the floor, the sink was dirty, the plastic cups were out and were not replaced. I figured the cleaning person was really busy and did not have time. I gave her/him the benefit of the doubt. The following day I went to work and came back. I opened the door and the same items were unacceptable! I said one day fine two days is not acceptable and will leave this place and never come back if this doesn't get fixed.

The following morning I got on the elevator to go directly to talked with the hotel manager and found myself with the housekeeping manager, Mrs. Martinez. I expressed my dissatisfaction with the cleaning. She apologized and said this would get fixed. I went to work. When I came back not knowing what I was going to find. I was surprised to see the excellent work they did by cleaning my room. No further issues during my stay. I would definitely stay there again.< /Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Most Crowne Plaza locations are quite nice, but compared to the other hotels in the area, this place is comparable to a motel. The staff lied to us about availability, and the rooms are generic at best. You're better off paying the same price or less at the Courtyard Marriott nextdoor.< /review>< Pictures>

They have smoked glass in the bathroom. Looks nice until you realize how much light is transmitted into the room. I get up early, shower and go get coffee while I wait for my family to wake up. However in this room I had to shower in the dark to prevent from waking them.

Additionally the Cabana pool side rooms have exterior doors so you feel like the property is 40 years old.

The last night the air condition went out and the desk clerk said "sorry" and then just proceeded through the check- out process.

The rest of the staff were friendly and helpful.</Text>

<text>This hotel is probably one of the most terrible and overpriced hotels I have ever been. Terrible rooms, one micro window with a view to the roof of an other building, old carpets inside and outside the rooms. Ac system had a noise all the time. And they charged for parking overnight simply ridiculous. It feels like a 30 dollar motel and they charge 349dollars per night.  Staff is nice and friendly.<//text>< gmap_id>

<Review>My wife and I visit the Palo Alto and San Jose area 2 or 3 times a year. My wife's sister and husband live in Palo Alto and my brother lives in San Jose. When we visit the area we stay at the Palo Alto Crown Plaza. We have stayed at the Cabana many times. Since it ts a business oriented hotel, it is cheaper on the weekends than on the week days. The staff is attentive and the rooms are great. The only negative is that breakfast is not included.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Our wedding reception was here and out of town guests enjoyed their stay at this hotel.  Unfortunately, Charles Hall, Director of Rooms, is useless and does not return messages--irregardless if you write or leave telephonic messages.  The rest of the staff is very accommodating and friendly.  However, any person who is so disrespectful of paying customers, should not be in such a position.</text>

Overall my experience was pretty positive. The hotel is nice and clean, well-maintained. The staff was awesome.

My only gripe is that I felt it was priced pretty high for the value I got - even worse when I found out they were charging for parking (which no one else in the area does). Also the first room I got was really bad (the tiny window looked directly into a wall) but thankfully there were other rooms and the staff moved me.<//review>

Crowne Plaza Palo Alto shows it age....décor and service lacking.  Cost is extremely high per night, including charging extra for parking and internet.  Did not restock complimentary water bottles or coffee/tea during stay.  Bathroom leaked from room above, internet didn't work consistently, dining staff was inattentive and room was noisy (hall noise, door to service stairs slamming during the night)and far too much exterior light coming from windows (curtains did not close properly) and around room entry door.   On the positive, it was conveniently located to place of business, and valet team was prompt with bringing forward the car (guess that's why it cost so much to park).< /Review>

The staff here will take their shirt of and give it to you if you needed it. I was amazed at the service that this crew has. The rooms are old and dated but the crew makes you forget all about the rooms. Thank you desk, shuttle, bar, maid, and any other crew member that I forgot for an AMAZING stay!</Text>

A good solid hotel that is close to the office.

Compared to other hotels of the same caliber, this hotel does an excellent job across the board.

Just remember, this isn't a Michelin 5 star hotel - but it is a good place to stay while in or around Palo Alto.</review>

We stay here when we come into town for treatments at Stanford. They always let us check in early ~11am, so when we get out of the hospital late at night, we can just go straight to our room. The beds are very comfortable and room service is the best.</Text>

Front desk staffs were friendly and lobby area was up to date. Front desk staff offered me 20% discount for the bar when I asked if there's any place serving good at night (after 10pm). Room was little out dated.</text>

Staying with my family, I expressed that they're were two adults and two children staying; however, they towels in the room were only for two people. The coffee packets in the room were decaf, not regular coffee.

Coffee in the lobby was empty and when I let the front staff know, they told me that it shouldn't even be there because it should have been removed an hour earlier; if they are not going to offer it, they should remove it.

Internet extremely slow, although it was included in my price, it didn't not matter because I could not download my mail; had to go to the Corner Bakery to use there internet and have breakfast there instead of the hotel.

I didn't see the pride of Crowne Plaza's as in other cities where I stay.< /Text>

Stayed for a week for business.

Good points:
- location
- food quality
- free wifi

Bad points:
- high charge for self parking
- food choice very limited on room service menu
- bathroom is old - sink and shower poor. e.g. nowhere to put your stuff next to sink, shower head is very low, etc.
- gym is small and pretty limited
- no free water< /Review>

The hotel was well situated for my business trip. Unfortunately we could not book the hotel for the entire trip and had to switch hotels for the last night. The booking agent mentioned a 4 night minimum starting on Thursday but there seemed to be some confusion about it. Nonetheless, the hotel was well kept, the rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly.</Review>

This actually was a huge inconvenience for my father who's wheelchair could not fit through the end door. However this did not damper my stay because the staff did troubleshoot the issue and called me in the morning to fix the problem. This is my 2nd time staying in this hotel and both times I felt very comfortable. The hotel staff here is very welcoming and accommodating. I do not stay with IHG brand hotels very often but after booking the presidential suite and meeting many of the wonderful employees at this location I know I will be back. I would give this hotel 4 starts for accommodation and 5 stars for customer service. The staff at crown plaza Palo Alto are amazing!!!<//review>< pics>

<Review>This staff at the check-in table were wonderful. Very helpful and accommodating. Because of that and the great pool, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

A secret, The Beatles were housed here for their last concert.  Ask for the rooms they sleep in.  Word leaked out and hotel was mobbed by hordes of teenage girls.  The Beatles left in a garbage truck, then switched to their limo.  This hotel when it opened was the finest hotel between San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Very popular with Asian business people today.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>I was only here for one night between meetings and catching a flight out of SJC early the next morning.

This hotel was close to where my late evening meetings were being held so I chose to stay closer to my meeting place and not the airport. This worked out great, as the hotel was a perfect choice to end my evening, have a nightcap, and a great night's sleep before heading off to the airport at 5AM.< /text>< resp>

The great thing about this hotel is that it is set well back from noisy El Camino.

The hotel survey from IPSOS does not ask about noise levels in the room itself, just outside. Like most US hôtels, the air conditioning is very noisy, and the refrigerator, which is empty, goes on and off noisily all night long. I managed to turn the air conditioning off, though it still made some noise. In other hôtels I unplug the refrigerators, but that is not possible here. I was able to minimize the noise by turning the temperature control to the highest temperature setting.

Other than that, I like the style of the hotel and was able to find a good running trail nearby. (The bicycle trail into Palo Alto, if you look on Google earth.)<//review>

<UserId.>None<//UserId.><date>1372636800000<//date><review>I took a few days after a conference in San Francisco and moved down south a bit to the Palo Alto Cabana Crowne Plaza. From the photos it looked very nice, and usually when I just judge by the photos I'm disappointed. THIS HOTEL, however, was in no way a disappointment. It is excellent! The hotel is spacious and clean, beautiful setting. Parking lot was clean and easy to access. I was on the 8th floor and overlooked the pool and surrounding mountains. Very nice. Room was very clean and tidy. Bathroom was well stocked and cleaned every day. It was also a very quiet place. The pool area is the best. It is large, clean, very well kept. The pool was busy, yet quiet and nice to be at. There are shaded areas at the pool in case you want to avoid the sun. The restaurant was outstanding. I had breakfast there three of four days and it was very good. I had a later dinner there one night and the food was very tasty and cooked to order. From this property you are 10 minutes from Stanford and about 10 minutes from a very nice (and busy) "downtown" area of Palo Alto. Drive down there, find a place to park and just walk up and down the Avenue. So many things to visit. Overall this property is an A++. One more thing: All of the staff there were excellent. The housekeeping staff was very kind and considerate. The restaurant staff was "service first." The front desk staff was great and helpful. Overall, this is a very good place to stay. I will return, that's for sure.</review>< rate>

This was a last minute booking, so I expected to pay more. I sure was surprised by the final bill! I was even more disappointed when the hotel room (one of the last few left) looked no better than a typical Holiday Inn. The elevator was loud, even though I was some ways from it. There are better properties nearby, which I was at the following day (and liked it MUCH better).<//Text>

I'm an IHG Platinum Elite member and stayed here for 1 night for business. It's not located in the best area, you'll have to drive a bit to get to some decent restaurants and shops. I would definitely prefer to stay in downtown PA.

This hotel does have many onsite amenities. I used the gym, which was spacious and has weights + benches + cardio machines, but no leg machines. Pool was there but didn't have chance to use it. Restaurant is open late, which is nice. There's also an area for buying convenience items like tylenol, nyquil, etc. which was useful.

Unfortunately the room quality was not good. I ended up with a room with a window that faces the outdoor walkway on the 2nd floor, meaning no privacy. I was too exhausted to ask for a room change since I checked in late in the evening, but this was definitely really disappointing. Because the window faced the outside, the sound proofness was also really bad. I could hear people parking and locking their cars while I was trying to sleep. I guess this is what it's like to stay in a motel room.

The ridiculous thing was that the room was priced at $445 a night for that week - not worth it. I understand they were hosting a conference during that time so there may have been a price increase, but it's still pretty unacceptable given the experience I had.

In conclusion, if you want to pay $445 a night for a motel experience then I guess you can stay here. Or maybe consider staying at a Marriott or SPG property, because at least they honor elite status.< /text>

Stayed at this hotel when visiting Palo Alto. The hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were wonderful, clean, dark for rest, nice temperature and great beds. I highly recommend The Crown plaza!</review>

I had a great experience here, I do feel it was a bit pricey for the size of the rooms and overall price in general.  Maybe it's just location that is overpriced in the general area.  Good bed, great breakfast and the hotel staff were so great and helpful!</Text>

<Review>For a professional event, the ballroom is nice enough, and the food was well done, but the parking is kind of a nightmare. The parking lot isn't well maintained and it's awkwardly being the building near a shabby awning. Once inside the building, it's fine.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

We had nothing but top notch service at the Crowne Plaza Palo Alto, including a complimentary room upgrade, food truck party in the parking lot, lovely pool, and very clean and comfortable room. The service was very thoughtful, including the breakfast maitre d' remembering that I drank my coffee half decaf.<//text>

As a pregnant female, I had concerns with my safety generally - the hotel staff offered no alternative accommodations. Arrived in room to discover that TV, telephone, and heating were all not functioning. Maintenance was able to correct the telephone - not able to resolve other issues. Worst night sleep in a very long time. Room rate was ~$300 and the staff did not offer any refund to compensate for non-functioning room.

<Review>Staff was excellent, but the room was designed in a strange way. The bathroom did not have a mirror in front of the sink, which I found to be strange. The opening "window" in replacement of the mirror was nice and helped to open the room, but I would rather have the mirror for getting ready.</Review>< gmapID>

<review>We were going between Sunnyvale and Palo Alto so I really liked this location. We spent a day in the city, shopping, and the beach. One of the reasons we chose this hotel is the 1-800 staff told us the pool was heated. When we checked in we found out it was solar heated and there wasn't a lot of sun to heat the pool. My boys had fun anyway. I wouldn't get in! That was our only complaint.<//review>< pictures>

Two big thumbs up because it is dog friendly, but two thumbs down for being too expensive during the week ad not offering extended stay rates. This is a 4 four star hotel charging 5-6 star rates during the week. Concierge did not have mail service (stamps for sale) which was inconvenient, especially since it is a known business hotel.<//review>

While the room was very comfortable, I could have used extra pillows. I suppose I could have requested more, but never had the time. I did like the fact the bathroom closet had a light so I did not have to use the nightlight I brought.< /Text>

We had a nice stay and the general manager was very friendly on site. The only complaints I would add is that we got the suite but they were unable to give us a key to the main room. We had to enter through the last door into the bedroom which took some of the suite appeal away. Everything in the suite was quite nice. The other small complaints and why I didn't do 10 on everything is that the breakfast eggs were made from mix or completely grainy. For $20 per person the scrambled eggs were very disappointing. The bar attendant was also not on her game and wouldn't agree to give a glass of champagne so I finally offered to buy the bottle but then the bottle which is $20 at Trader Joes ended up being $70 which felt expensive when I just wanted to bring up one bottle. Other than that it was a great stay and thank you.</Text>

The staff at Crowne Plaza Palo Alto were friendly and professional. The hotel was clean and, overall, served our needs. The bed was very comfortable and so were the pillows. We would recommend this hotel to others.</review>

<Review>I normally really enjoy Crowne Plaza's.  They're normally consistent the world over.  But this place was not.  The room I stayed in was really odd.  It was like a suite...with a separate room to work in.  But the lighting was atrocious.  I had video conferences and I had to move lamps from the main room into the office space just so people could see me.  I'm not sure who designed it but it was a large room that was just wasting space with incredibly poor lighting.

I have had the opportunity to stay again and I've chosen to go across the street to Dinah's...< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

We arrived there around 23:30. There were just one lady to at the front desk. She was not good to checking people. Besides us, there were 5-6 people needed be checked in. It took almost 20 mins the lady make the checking in. Well, we got dirty rooms and there were no more double/double room. She just arranged to add a roller-bed for our double/double room!

We stay at this excellent hotel because there's no room in the Manger where I grew-up - and the eternal City of Palo Alto is changing and my parents are growing old.
The amenities are top-notch but some of the mechanical equipment is dated - but/and they're always busy working to up-date things.

(The A/C was a bit noisy and sudden on-off, the in-unit 'fridge compressor mad a constant beeping if turned on -- and in the next-unit children and their parents were loud through the adjoining doors - but what can you say to loud people especially ones with children? Any type of mention only makes them louder...and angry.)< /Text>

Too far from downtown PA, 20 min drive. Air conditioner didn't work, phone didn't work. Wifi didn't work. Rooms are way expensive considering what you get at $2500/5 nights. In-room fridge was empty, not even a bottle of water, for $500/night??? Breakfast buffet was barely meh at $20. Very disappointed. Staying elsewhere next time.< /review>

Given a choice between former motels and very expensive properties in a high end community, Crowne Plaza was a perfect middle ground. Great facility, nice rooms, generally quiet and comfortable. Rates likely to vary greatly based on travel dates.< /text>

Had to check-in late at night and they had a room available. Room was big, as was the bathroom. Nice, quiet stay, they also didn't mind a late check-out at 1.

Only thing I wished for was that they had a couple of complimentary water bottles.</Review>

I enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto. The location was great, staff was courteous and seemed like they really cared, facility was clean room was clean, great pillows and shower. I would recommend the Crowne to others staying in the vicinity.< /text>

< Review>
$250 Motel with lousy service. Don't stay here...

I stayed here on business travel and now I'm recommending that it be taken off their list of preferred locations.

The hotel is in need of repair and it does not resemble the ambiance that they try to portray on their site. The pool was closed even though the outdoor pools at neighboring locations was open. Throughout the hotel many things were only half repaired. It's as if repairs started and they ran out of funds.

There are garish lights positioned above every window that shine through the curtains. They would not turn these lights off but offered a curtain clip instead. The clips do not keep all of the light out of the room. I had enough light that I could still read my newspaper.

The hotel is an older building and the walls are thin. I could hear the elevators all night long. I could hear conversations in the hallways.

To top it all off they refused to help me with the billing situation. They were supposed to bill the employer and now they have billed both of us. They are argumentative and completely unwilling to try to help solve the situation.

The best part of my stay was the free shuttle service. The gentleman that drove the shuttle was also quite a good conversationalist.< /Review>

<rating>None<//rating><text>I wasn't expecting high-end comfort when I booked this reservation, but I do like a clean, relatively fresh-smelling room. The hotel exterior and lobby are presentable and relatively inviting. We were placed in one of the rooms that faced an outdoor second-story walkway, with viewing from the walkway into each of the rooms, which gave the room more of a motel feel than a hotel. I don't think all of the rooms are set up this way, but this is what we got. When we entered the room the smell was almost overwhelming. It really stunk, can't tell you of what, just an old musty smell, probably because the room had no outdoor-facing windows and was constantly closed up. It was gross. The breakfast was ok, definitely overpriced for the buffet.<//text>< pictures>

No heat, plumbing wouldn’t drain.  Rude bartender. This place has gone down hill. Sadly we exclusively used this place for all of our Stanford functions. We will have to find a new place to stay.</text>

the property being a pet friendly place is why I chose this location. the place itself is very nice but some of the staff are very inattentive for the value they put on themselves.<//Review>

GREAT hot tub and pool. Shuttle schedule was different from what I was told, but after our first day there, we got rides from other friends. In the lobby they have water/coffee available which is a HUGE plus!</Review>

<review>Do NOT choose Crowne Plaza Palo Alto, If you can choose Crowne Plaza Silicon Valley/Milpitas. 

The Overall experience in Crowne Plaza Silicon Valley are 10 times better than Crowne Plaza Palo Alto...

Crowne Plaza Palo Alto charge you everything.. 
80 dollars value no more.< /review>< pictures>

Don't let the modern front lobby fool you - most of this hotel is actually an old motel with doors that open onto an outdoor walkway.  The room decor is dated and a little tired.  The HVAC doesn't work.  I am a Spire member, and have stayed at IHG properties all over the world, and I was shocked that this is the hotel offered in the middle of Silicon Valley!< /text>

I will be staying at the hotel again soon. In September I will be coming back for business and have already decided to stay at your property. I hope your parking in the front is better and I don't have a repeat of no shampoo or conditioner in my bathroom. Both were inconveniences, but wouldn't deter me from staying at your property again.< /Review>

It looks nice but is average for any hotel in this price range.  The doors of the rooms slam shut and there is too much noise heard through the walls.  I would try a different hotel in the same price range.</review>

We had a good stay. The only thing that spoiled it from being an excellent stay is that the pool was closed on Saturday for a special event. We had been moving our son all day and looked forward to coming back and using the pool.<//Text>

We've stayed here plenty of times and we typically have a great time. This time was no exception, except for the assistant manager at the restaurant, who was incredibly rude, disrespectful, and inappropriate. I'll head back to the hotel, but if I was the assistant restaurant manager I'll definitely be eating elsewhere.<//Review>

<Review>The property is OK-- pretty average in terms of overall ambience and comfort. What was troubling with my stay was there was a loud, middle-of-the-night pool party. It took hotel staff a while to resolve the issue - basically intoxicated individuals who had broken into the pool area. I imagine everyone who had a poolside room got a pretty lackluster night of sleep.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /gmap_id>< Time>

<Text>As an IHG Spire Member we were put in the most run down part of the building.  In BOTH rooms the AC did not work and we were moved at 10 p.m. even when I had surgery at 4 a.m. I was so dissappointed.  The only thing that saved our stay was the surrounding delicious restaurants that we found to eat at.  Other than that we had NO rest< /Text></record>

Beatles stayed in this hotel twice, the last time was at the end of their final world tour. See the room where they stayed if not occupied. Ask the front desk.

Great location for attending Stanford events.</review>

This is a great value in Palo Alto; nice facilities and location.  Only peeve on this visit was that my room was on the first floor, and that meant no privacy since it faced the busy parking lot.</Text>

the value per money not the best but the prices in palo alto are expensive.
the breakfast is very very expensive and you get poor selection of food . bread and pastry dry and not fresh.
For $20 you should have a the best. continental for $12 that include coffee and pastry that in every motel you get for free. the breakfast is the only thing that bother me.< /review>

I would have liked to think a discount on a future stay would have been offered but oh well. I didn't ask and they didn't offer. Nice hotel aside from that.</review>< GmapID>

Reception person friendly. Room mildew smell. Fan/vent in bathroom not working. Probably why room musty.
Toilet pressed up against bath/shower, akward.
Bathroom door inconvenient to open/close. Minimal TV channels, no movie or HBO, basic cable. Charged to park. Didn't like that.<//Text>

I really enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza in Palo Alto. I was staying for an interview and everything that was provided helped me relax and prepare for my interview, and it was in a convenient location that allowed me to go to the office I needed to go to easily, as well as meet up with friends in the area all by Uber.

The staff were very helpful and effective, and I cannot recommend this hotel enough.</text>

<Review>Second time Crowne Plaza in Pali Alto charged my credit card unjustly and for something that shouldn't have been charged. Using a free night stay under IHG's rewards program as advertised yet I was charged a partial amount that upon call to Palo Alto Crowne Plaza they admitted it wasn't my responsibility. Their accounting/billing department has done this twice to me where my card was charged for something that shouldn't have been. Beyond frustrated with them by now and not to mention the next morning while showering I realized the tub was backing up and I had to finish showering in a gross water backed up tub! Second time lesson learned that Palo Alto Crowne Plaza needs a better billing person or system. Just to be fair I've stayed every weekend for over a year and half in the Milpitas Crowne Plaza and they are on point in all reservations and charges. Never had any billing mishaps or problems with Milpitas.< /Review><user_id>None</user_id>< pics>

During an extended stay for work, I was placed in a room right behind the reception desk that was incredibly noisy. With that, and the uncomfortable mattresses and pillows in my room I got very, very little sleep!

I asked to be moved on multiple occasions, but the staff was unable to move me to a different room.<//Review>

Back rooms facing the houses have bathrooms where the toilet is NOT vented. Sewer gas smells wide spread. NOT too sure this is fixable. Property is old and needs a complete re-do. Broken concrete everywhere. Property shows signs of real age and deterioration. Would really avoid. This is NOT a quality property. I would NOT stay there again.</text>

<Text>I was charged the deposit fees of $50.00 that the hotel forget to release and after calling them twice I was told that it was my Bank's fault. The 'accountant' also charged my card a dollar in an attempt to remove it and reversed the charges but it still did not resolve the issue. My bank make the effort to get on the phone with Crowne Plaza and after a Royal run around with the staff the customer service supervisor finally got on the phone and brushed me off stating they were refunding me 'and what more do I want'? Horrible customer customer, they did not bother to listen to their customer. They made the mistake not once but twice and were quick to blame my bank for an error on their part but would not speak to me or the bank about it. Rather rushed me off the phone saying 'she was too busy and needed to attend to other customers' I had not had an issue with them till now and the first issue I had it was handled absolutely horribly and unprofessionally. Customer skills are none and they do not listen to their customers. I wouldn't recommend for stay unless you have the patience to spend weeks/ days resolving the financial issues and are okay with horrible treatment from the staff.< /Text><Rating>None< /Rating><gmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091</gmapID><date>1358985600000< /date><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

An all right experience; just all right, though. The hotel needs a little store for incidentals, snacks. I could not get a paper on Saturday morning without getting in my car. Many tacked on upgrades disguise the tired old hotel . . . .<//review>

We recently spent two nights at the Crowne Plaza Palo Alto.

Positives:
Pool with lovely poolside lounge chairs and oversized bath towels,
Good value,
Nice selection at the bar,
Clean facilities across the board.

Negatives:
Charge for overnight parking,
Dirty glass in room upon check in,
Styling seemed a bit outdated.< /text>

Fresh, updated look. Clean and comfortable rooms. Air conditioning was very noisy which was a plus for me because it acted like white noise which I like, but it could be very bothersome to someone else. I would stay here again.<//Text>

I've stayed at nicer hotels for less in the area. My room was accessed by going outdoors, that felt like I was staying in a motel. Bar/restaurant layout seemed poor and understaffed. Finding my room was difficult due to lack of signage and odd corridors< /Text>

We stayed here because we saw two concerts back to back at Shoreline Ampitheater. It's in fairly close proximity to the theater (minus traffic) and conveniently close to Stanford and shopping (i.e., Target, Safeway, Whole Foods).</Review>

Great hotel. Rooms are very modern and kept clean. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Free WiFi is 3mb/s, but I had no trouble using Skype. Does not have free parking, but if that is not an issue this hotel is a great choice for the Palo Alto/Mountain View area.</Text>

<Review>Hotel is nice and comfortable.
One should recheck the bill and the amount deducted from the card as the hotel deducted twice the required amount from my card and i am now running pillar to post to get it rectified.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fba78fa5aee1b:0xc1bcfddbc93e6091< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Unfortunately our stay consisted of:

Day 1 - Displaced from original reserved a room with patio near pool to 2nd floor
Day 1 - Short on towels
Day 2 - Loud noise from AC unit from 12am-3am
Day 2 - Weak water pressure 

All reported immediately and documented in the system for the manager to call me regarding our unfortunate stay. 


Thank you for the opportunity to share and provide
 feedback.

Regards, Lester</text>< pics>

The hotel is good, bed was good, room was clean.

But the desk surface is glass, and you CANNOT use a mouse on it. You would need a mouse pad<//Text>
