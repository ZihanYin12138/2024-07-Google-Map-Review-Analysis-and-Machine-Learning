Evans on Miramar is a great group of gentlemen. Same day service, walk ins welcome. I’ve brought my vehicle here for over 5 years now. I feel like they are always looking out for the health of my vehicle. I never feel like I’m being sold something I don’t need. Even if it’s not a Tuesday they are happy to taco bout it. My vehicle always leaves in a better condition than when I brought it in. Can’t recommend these guys enough! Thank you Evans on Miramar team! ✌🏽</Text>

< Review>
The Manager was friendly, easy to communicate with, and direct. I got a good deal on 4 new tires. While my car was being worked on, walked to one of the fast food joints, nearby. The tires were done about 15 minutes after i got back. It has been about 3 weeks since my install. The tires were well-balanced. My only minor gripe: right after the install, the car was pulling to the left a bit. I checked all 4 tires, and the right front, was 3 psi higher than the other 3 tires. Adjusted it, and it has been smooth sailing ever since. Great experience!< /Review>

Noticed one of my tires was low on air and took it in. It wasn’t the tire shop that I bought my tires from but they found the nail took it out and patched it in under 15 minutes. Fantastic!< /text>

After getting a flat I called in to see how long it would take for my tire to get patched. They let me know that it would be around 45 minutes. Once they realized that my tire was too worn to be fixed they let me know that I could get both back tires changed for a great price. By the time I came back from lunch we were ready to roll. I appreciate the help a lot.< /text>

I was in the market for new tires because mine were getting pretty bad. So I called Thursday and was able to get an appointment on Friday. When they were changing my tires and they called me and told me that brake pads and rotors needed to be changed.  I was so glad they did because I felt like I had to brake harder & my car wasn’t running smooth. I appreciate their attention to detail And being  upfront and honest. My car runs much better & they  did a excellent job.< /text>

Service was great, they were pretty quick once the parts came in. I was not pressured into anything and educated as to why i needed the service done .  The staff there were friendly and professional and very helpful. Their lobby is clean, not cluttered and they've also provided hand sanitizer for those that want it. Over all Mira Mar Evan Tires is a great place and I will continue to take my vehicle there.</Review>

I book an appointment for a wheel alignment the day before I came in. I was a little confused that I still had to wait an hour before my car was actually serviced. I don't doubt the quality of the service. The job took about 20 minutes after it finally got pulled into the garage. I was just disappointed that my appointment felt more like walk-in.

Update: I followed up with the customer service email as commented and after nearly 3 weeks, I never got a response back.< /Review>

Some of the other Evans tire locations in San Diego are a little sketchy, but this one is my go-to. I've had a couple sets of tires put on at this location so far and went back today to have my tire looked at that had a slow leak. The techs looked at it and found a cracked rim, put sealant on it, and were done within about an hour.

Excellent service, highly recommend this location. Also, Evans tire prices can't be beat.< /review>

Evans tire truly believes in making the customer #1 priority and not matter the issue to be fixed or addressed they handle it. As a customer my car had a few issues and even when the part had a defect they came and picked me up and brought the car back to the shop. I still felt like the issue wasn’t fully fixed and they are working with me in figuring it out and not caring. The manager and mechanics are personable and cares for the customers. Evans tires in Miramar have a great staff. Willing to go above and beyond!< /Review>

Super friendly, helpful & highly professional! They know their stuff, and they are honest & extremely efficient! The location on Miramar Road is where I had my fabulous experience with the coolest team of knowledgeable professionals I've ever met. Thank you so much Lavelle and the entire team there for your kindness and also helping educate me on how I should handle oil issues with my car.  I felt welcomed and cared about, and I experienced the best customer service I've come across in a long time. I will definitely be making Evan's my go-to place, and I highly recommend anyone who wants excellent service to come here!!!<//Text>

<text>We’ve used Evans for several repairs and have always found the staff professional, friendly and thorough and the service is fairly priced!  Today my husband found a screw in the tire of his new BMW i3.  He took it to Evans and, as always, they were fantastic.  They were able to do the repair immediately and my husband was able to watch.  Being a car guy, he saw the care they used in making the repair.  Evans is an excellent service center and we would recommend them to anyone and for any make or model of car!  Thanks guys!!!</text>< Pictures>

<text>Tire rotation and balance was excellent. Wheel alignment was excellent too with no complaints about either of the two. Rotors were turned without replacing both front rotors. After rotors were turned with new brake pads installed, noticed with windows down that the driver's side front rotors and brakes had an intermittent clicking/ticking sound when applying the brakes normally. When testing hard braking after servicing, the passenger side front rotors and brakes had a scrubbing sound as if there was an element of mild metal rubbing against metal.<//text>< pics>

Worst possible customer service by a guy named Dave. Who went back on the price he gave me on the phone, and became very rude when i told him "i thought you said $240"
Evan tires , advertises amazing customer service, but that was the worst customer service I received anywhere!! ridiculous!</text>

< review>
I have been their customer for almost 10 years until I last brought my car in for the free service that was included with the purchase of new tires. The tires needed balancing and pressure check. I specifically asked the mechanic to let me know if he sees anything that needs to be fixed. When he was done, he said that he corrected the tire pressure and did not see any other problem.
As soon as I left the shop the car was continuously pulling to the right. I returned the next day and I asked the manager to have the car inspected again, because the car did not behave like  that before the service. A young mechanic immediately noticed, without even taking the wheel out, that the front right tire had a separation and it formed a bubble.
Further looking into the records of the previous day work, we found out that the mechanic reported the previous day that the car has 20k more miles than it actually had, to force us out of warranty and into buying new tires when we discover the problem. What a despicable individual...(and possibly a company policy?) They blamed the tire damage on the road conditions.
I have asked for a second opinion about what could have caused the sudden tire separation during the service and I was told that the most likely cause was a brief hyperinflation of the tire, which I have suspected all along. Would you return to a shop that put your family in danger through such despicable acts? NEVER!<//review>

Went in looking for high end tires.  Had the sales guy hand me to someone on the phone because he didn’t want to close the sale.  Guy on the phone warns me from buying the high end tires that everyone on every forum says are the best.  Says I should get a different one and quotes me a price that was above what I had previously researched.  I politely said I’d go elsewhere. No harm no foul.

Then the first salesman said “be careful who you buy them from”.

I asked him why.  My curiosity was peaked.  Are there forgery tires out there 😂.  He was slow to come up with the answer which was something like “because they’ll add stuff on”.  All I could think was the extra $100 they quoted.  Don’t treat me like I’m stupid because I’ve gotten better quotes.<//Text>

waste of money, Fake warranty and insurance  as they try to find a number of issues on your car as much as they can, to reject, deny those warranties, and a false buy 1 get 1 free, I paid exactly the same amount for 2 tires out the door ,never never Again<//Review>

<text>I went in for an oil change, alignment and installed 4 fresh tires. It is pretty expected to reset the computer after an oil change so that the service reminder doesn't come on every time but not at this place. They probably have a lot of experience with Japanese cars or cars that are older because they had NO IDEA how to reset the service computer in my car (2014 F30 BMW). The guy told me that after I drove the car, it was going to reset on it's own so I believed him. I drove around for 20-30 minutes and nothing.

I came back and the mechanic argued with me about experimenting to figure it out meanwhile, he had no idea what he was doing after I gave him permission to do so. After fiddling for some time on YouTube so he can figure it out, I got fed-up and said I'll take care of it myself because I wasted enough time already. I came home, opened up YouTube, searched for F30 computer reset videos and fixed it in less than 5 minutes.

If you're going to come here, alignment / tires are OK because they give you a good deal if you mention TireRack prices but if you have a newer car, avoid this place for any type of engine maintenance. For that purpose, they are bunch of amateurs. Two stars removed because the mechanic was very rude, wasted my time and didn't know what he was doing.</text><user_id>116018158826570460437<//user_id><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

<Text>Andre, the store manager, was extremely knowledgable and gave us every possible option when doing alignment repairs and tire purchases. He really made sure we were able to spend money only where it really mattered and referred us to reputable professionals for anything he couldn't do. For sure going back for future services. If you go, ask for andre. The guy really knows his stuff.<//Text>< pictures>

<user_id>101690371629433083906<//user_id><Resp>None</Resp><Text>Shady liars.  Steer clear.     I followed the buy 2 get two free ad.  Too good to be true.  I blew a tire and wanted to buy a set to replace mine.  The first day I called and got a regional call center.  He said they didn't have the tire I wanted in stock but if I come in tomorrow he would make sure the tires were there.  Came in the next day and they had one tire.  Junior tried to make it my fault. Rude jerkoff.  Instead of saying kiss off I tried to be polite.  He assured me that if I came back the next day they would have the tires.  Do you see where this is going?  Came back the next day and there were two Hispanic families trying to get some satisfaction for being ripped off on mechanic work.  Waited twenty minutes.  The guy finally tells me they have 3 tires!  Wow.  Now, if I just come back tomorrow.....they will have all the tires I need.  The price they quoted me was not 2 free tires.  They charge over MSRP and then include huge markup for install package.  That day I went and bought tires from someone else.  They beat the Evans price by 50 bucks and gave me lifetime rotation, hazard, balancing and other perks.  Oh, and a $60 rebate on a gift card.  Thank God Evans couldn't come up with four tires or I would have bought them. The guy never even called to say the tire came in.  So I didn't get to tell them how bad they really are.   I will never use Evans for anything, ever.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbff554241a4ed:0x5196e3d01766adbc< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

The gentlemen at this Evans location have always been nice and pleasant to me. I have not felt as though they were trying to get more money out of me. All their recommendations have always been warranted, whether I decide to do them or not. I will continue to come to this Evans for service now and in the future.<//Text>

I called to get new tires.  They were super helpful and gave me a great deal on some Pirelli tires.  Also,  they got me in and out in about 35 min.  I have gone to Evans tire before and this was my second time.  They always have great customer service,  they do their best to get you in and out,  and they always try to have you the best product at the greatest deal.  I would highly recommend them for your next auto purchase.</Text>

Pretty good experience with this place, I normally stay away from chain like repair shops but all in all had great service. I went in for tires and came out with new shocks as well. They don't just do tires also repairs. I did have to wait longer than expected for the correct shocks to arrive but not through their fault. Dave the manager and Christian the head mechanic really know their stuff. I would recommend this place to anyone just expect to wait a while for your vehicle to be done, they are busy.< /Review>

I've had great service at Evans Tires in the past, but I don't recommend this particular location. I stopped in on my lunch break for a front end alignment on a F150. After the 5 minutes it took to get someone's attention, they told me it would take about 45 minutes. I came back about 45 minutes later and it wasn't even on the rack yet. There was only one other car in the garage. It took another 30 minutes, and the truck drives fine now, but I was generally unimpressed with their service</text>

First off, I have always had respect for Evan's tires. They have always provided me with amazing customer service and my cars have always been taken care of.

I called ahead a couple of weeks ago (got a flat running over a rock on the I-15!) to make sure they had time to work on my car because I was in a real time crunch. I had been here before and knew they could get busy. I was also looking for something specific that I had previously purchased here before and were, lucky me, on sale again: Pirelli tires! Okay...moving on...

I got in and spoke to Chuck who was taking care of the front counter. He looked a bit frazzled with the calls, customers, and orders coming in...and I was pretty impressed with how he handled everything in a quick and friendly manner. I started talking to him and he was the sweetest character to help me. He worked with me in a quick and customer service oriented manner. I went back and forth with him on how I was going to get my car back since I wasn't going to be back before closing time. He looked at the work orders before me and said that he could get me in and out within the hour. Sure enough, he was able to deliver and I got my car back with a new pair of Pirelli's.

I highly recommend this Evan's Tire and most others...I would recommend them all but haven't visited them all yet! ;)< /review>

<review>I used to go to Discount Tire down the road but was looking for a place that also can do alignments. After calling a few places, Evans Tire was able to beat both Discount Tire and Bears Tires prices, and they also are able to do an in house 4 wheel alignment. Evans serviced the vehicle quickly and the mechanics were honest, they told me that my brakes have about 5-8k miles left on them after the Ford dealership told me to replace them ASAP. Nice staff, good prices, quick service, I have no complaints.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The worst customer service ever! Was told to go to a junk yard by the salesman when I asked about a rim for my brand new car! Called and spoke to a manager and he sounded like he just didn’t want my business!< /Text>

I shopped online for probably a full hour looking at reviews and prices before choosing to visit this Evans location. I went in for a standard oil change mid day and was surprised to find no wait. The front desk staff was very friendly both before and after my car had been done. They were very informative and casual while bringing to my attention that I would need some other work done but they did not push a sale on me what so ever. In fact they told me to ride it out a while more and that my car would be fine to do so. It probably only took them about 30 minutes to do a full oil change which included a free tire rotation. (Make sure you ask for a free tire rotation when you go in as it is complimentary.) Overall my experience was as good as it gets when it comes to an oil change. Definitely check out Evans if you're not sure of a good place to go.</Review>

<Text>I just have my  Sprinter service by this location  and I find out the way that they're lifting this large vehicle  it cost a damage to the chassis from underneath of the vehicle, when I talk with the store manager he said "that's the way we are lifting all these large Vehicles even the one from Amazon" all this large Vehicles they have a frame and also directions how to lift with making no damage to the chassis that they do not follow or do not know about it, I did not receive any sorry from the store manager, sales or mechanics for the damage that they did to my vehicle, it seems that they don't care much about their customers, If you do bring the vehicle for service in this particular location you be careful inspect underneath of the vehicle and make sure there is no damage on your chassis,
I would not return to Evans Tires again for their service although I have all my three vehicles brand new tire sets installed with them

I go here for alignment, tire rotation and oil changes now. Too many places leave your engine in a state of disarray (e.g. spark plugs pulled out, air box not closed etc.). Too many places such as Jiffy Lube take liberties with your car that they are not supposed to. I have been very pleased with them so far.

The only thing I didn't like was that I had to specifically inquire about the rebates that I was promised over the phone. They weren't being shady, but there didn't seem to be a clear understanding of company promotions between the man in the call-center to the men at front-desk. Still, I would rather give 5 starts instead of 4.</text>

Recently, I went for a tire rotation on the first car, and once again it was fast, friendly, and free.  Can't ask for better than that.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>It took 4 hours to inspect the car brakes and to do the front ones works. The guy in the front desk said it will be taking only about 1 hour !!
And there is a new sound from the rear brakes that was not there .

About the price of the tires ... They told me it will cost me 400 $ for the 4 tires ( with the offer buy 2 get 2 free)!! But I didn't.
I went to the discount tires and they give me around 290 $

I will never go to them again .< /review><name>Turki Aziz<//name>< resp>

<text>I have taken the wheel alignment package for 3 years, but whenever i go for wheel alignment they mention something or other is not working or they are short staffed and they cant do it, i always have to come back again to get it done. If they are providing such packages they should have the bandwidth to provide such services without causing lot of troubles to customers.</text>< rating>

It took 4 hours for an oil change and new tires!!! I called just to see what they would tell me how long the tire change would be and he said once up on the jacks 1 hour- I called bull crap and told him we will never use them again.  We were told they do military discount and they did not when we got there.  He said he didn't price the tires because we called corporate so he stuck with corporate prices!!! That is such bull crap!!  Why are the prices different???  He said they were busy- got there and only 1 car ahead...they took other cars while mine was sitting on the jacks!!!!  DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!</Text>

< Review>
Had a great experience with these folks. We showed up late for arranged check in, and they were extremely helpful and friendly. While my wife checked us in, Perry took me and our rig back to our covered space. After dropping me at the site, he went back to the office to get my wife with his golf cart. Great people here. The grounds were very clean and the security appeared top notch. Cameras were everywhere and the lighting was great. Highly recommend Darrel's if you have an RV you'd like to store covered.< /Review>

Came here after a bad experience at another storage facility and OMG, night and day!!! These guys are so freaking nice, accommodating, caring and really made me feel like family. One of the team members brought me an ice cold bottle of water, they showed us multiple spaces and tried to find convenient spaces next to each other for all our trailers and boat and camper. The facility is secure, well cared for and they have AMAZING deals going (at least on the space types we needed).

Highly recommend!!!</review>

Though my rent has occasionally late, I've never been treated any way but as their best customer!  I am sure they have entire facility of "best" customers too lol.
Only down tik I have are their prices for long term renters. I pay over $210.00 a month for their 3rd largest unit and the price just went up, sigh.</Review>< user_id>

Never, never, never go there. They always seem to go slowly past when your door is open. They seem to treat the tenants with contempt. No favors, no breaks, ....... More rules and 'No's' than anything other place I've ever been. Oh yes, and don't be late with the rent or you'll find your locker up for Fast-Track auction<//Text>

I have rented units in two Derrel's Mini Storage facilities, and managers at another are customers of mine, so I go to those three often.</Text>

<Text>I would have given 4 stars if my waffle bowl wasnt so stale that I didnt even eat it. Normally it's my favorite part :( I hope it wasn't one of the display cones. How do they store these things?? Shouldnt be hard to put it in a container to preserve freshness. Next time(only if I'm feeling impulsive) if its stale I will request a refund. Besides that the service was good, ice cream was good, but it was far too expensive for them to cheap out and give me this ancient waffle bowl. $7 for 2 scoops in a bowl I expect freshness!! I dont even care about the service. Quality over everything<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>105088166228435868049</UserId.><resp>None< /resp><time>1588742810397</time>< rate>

Too pricey. BR  doesn't pack down their pints and you end up with air pockets even though your paying outrageous prices. For as much as you pay really, you have to weigh it.<//review>

Love the ice cream, but it seems the scoop size is for kids, at almost $3 a scoop, I would love to see a bit bigger size scoop. The flavors are awesome and their ice cream cakes are to die for.</Text>

I was just here a moment ago with my kids and they always enjoy coming here. My personal favorite ice cream scoops are the Oreo cookie, jamoca, and strawberry cheesecake. You can also ask for samples.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>This is the worst place to order your ice cream cake. I had order an ice cream cake for my niece’s  birthday and they forgot to take out the plastic wrap in between the ice cream cake. I had served half of the cake to my guests and by that time one of the kids we’re choking on a piece of plastic from the cake. All the guest we’re frantic cuz they didn’t know if their kids had eaten the plastic already. I had to throw out the cake and apologizes to all the parents. We called the BR on Meat street and they said no manger was available to address the problem. I told them this is unacceptable because this is a dangerous problem and need immediate attention. I asked them to check if anymore of the ice cream cake had plastic wrap inside. They brush me off as if though I’m making this up. The cashier called the owner but he said “ have her called back tomorrow and talk to the cake decorator about this problem” and he told her to tell me that it’s Not his problem but it’s the cake’s decorator fault. How can a owner tell your customer that it’s not your problem and go take it up with your employee. I was so furious that I had to call the corporate office to address the issue. The danger here is that many of the cakes that came out of this business may of have plastic inside of it and he should have adddredd those issue instead of brushing me off like it’s no big deal. I have video footage and pictures to prove what was inside the cake. Till today I never got my refund nor did the owner ever call to apologize for ruining my party. I was so stress out because I was worried that my guests. The corporate people never did much to address this issue because they said it’s a franchise own so they have very little quality control over each location. My advice is to be careful when you deal with businesses that have no backing from the corporate office. No one will look out for you. Plastic seran wrap is toxic if they use it in the freezer. This is an issue that concerns me and the safety process that is overlooked by the poor quality control. Just imagine if your 5 year old child ate the plastic and could have choke on it how would you feel. This is my issue within Baskin Robbin corporate  and the business owner. Lack of accountability on both parties. Sad and pathetic.< /Text>< Pictures>

I am 67 yrs old and have never sought out care with a Chiropractor or that was until I threw out my back last month. The treatment I have received from Dr. Dilliard, Dr.Carp and the rest of the team has been amazing. I feel younger and more agile than I did 20 yrs ago! I literally have no back pain in my lower back and the stiffness in my neck that I attributed to old age is gone! Thank you all for giving back to me a healthy body.<//Text><response>None</response>< pictures>

<Review>Dr. Dilliard and his staff are very friendly and caring.  I've been going here for about 18 years.  I realized after my first visit how helpful a chiropractic adjustment can be when Dr. Dilliard examined me and asked about the restricted range of motion for my neck.  At first I didn't realize it was reduced until after the adjustment.  I've been going ever since, mostly for maintenance but occasionally to address a specific issue.  Dr. Dilliard truly cares for his patients, takes the time to listen to your concerns, explains why the problem exists, and provides recommendations on how to improve strength and flexibility to maintain your physical health.  He is a great chiropractor.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_id>

I started going to Dilliard Chiropractic about 2 months ago. The staff is both pleasant and friendly! Dr Dilliard is an exceptional chiropractor who cares about the well being of his patients. My first visit was very thorough. I would recommend him to anyone looking for an experienced chiropractor who knows what he is doing.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Dilliard is absolutely the best chiropractor, period. I have been seeing him for years, initially for pain brought on over time from various accidents, incidents, and life in general, and now, mainly for maintenance. He doesn't just treat my issues, he educates me on ways I can help myself outside of his treatments. His staff is also knowledgeable and always gracious and accommodating.</review><userid>111982104377249657127</userid><name>Kathleen Hill<//name><Time>1608128794675<//Time><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>My husband and I have been seeing doctor Dilliard for years and it has been mainly for maintenance.   I can tell you that he has saved my life more than once.  He is very attentive and knew I was not at all feeling myself and recognized that I was actually needing more help than my regular doctors were willing to do.  Feeling ignored by my regular doctors, Dr.. Dilliard kept insisting that I needed more help than I was getting. Long story short...he called the ER and informed them that I was being transport and all the findings of his treatments and insisted I be taken cared of correctly.   If it were not for him caring for is patients the way he does, I would not be here.  Love my doctor....he is such an angel.  I will continue to see him because I enjoy feeling healthy.</text>< resp>

<review>I have been seeing Dr Dilliard throughout the past 19 years. My work is labor intensive, so my lower back and neck are in constant need of his expert attention. Finding a chiropractor with his degree of knowledge and skill along with his level of sincerity and trust has been a true blessing. Dr Dilliard is all that rolled into one and is there waiting to greet you with a smile and a really bad dad joke!
His staff is really awesome too!</review>< Response>

When you’re 19 years old you don’t expect to have any back problems, but as someone who danced for six years and got into a couple accidents i was struggling with constant pain. A family friend recommended this place to me and after coming here i found out the disks in my spine were starting to get squished putting all sorts of pressure on my nerves. I’ve been getting treated for a couple months now and i feel an extreme difference! I hardly ever have any pain in my back and even my headaches have been reduced significantly. Plus, everyone who works here is so sweet and welcoming! This place is definitely worth it<//review>

Since I've been seeing Dr. Dilliard and his team my quality of life has improved greatly. I've been an extreme sports enthusiast my entire life and have experienced multiple injuries including numerous concussions. The regular treatments I've received have increased my range of motion, my mental clarity, and have decreaed the chronic pain caused by these injuries. Dr. Dilliard and his team are kind and professional and I highly recommend there services!!< /review>

I have been going to my visits here since March 2020 and I’ve noticed such a huge difference with my back pain. I would recommend this office to anyone who is looking for an awesome chiropractor!</review>

<text>An employee was so rude to me after I asked about any of their employees testing positive for COVID. I asked if they had taken any procedures to ensure the safety of their employees and patients and was told nothing is being done. I am scared to walk in this place because there aren’t any precautions regarding COVID. Please do not do business here and risk getting sick.

In response to Owner:
I was enquiring about new patient forms when I walked in and asked these questions. The amount of disrespect was appalling and I know the truth about employees getting patients sick. It’s is disgusting how you lie about this to keep your business afloat.

I did not have the best experience here at all I came in with a shoulder issues. My shoulder makes loud pops not normal. Went there did X-rays and I go to my next appointment they are trying to say the issues are cause of how my neck is not aligned and my back is not aligned and my Pelvis is not straight. I’m no doctor but my shoulder is making loud pops I don’t think that is caused from my back not being straight. I’ve worked in sales a customer walks in for one thing and you try to sell them the whole package which is what they are trying to do. I highly recommend you do not come here< /Review>

{'time': 1596482039386, 'text': 'I am sorry your experience was not what was expected. We offer comprehensive corrective chiropractic care for those who want to remedy the cause of their problem, as well as relief oriented care that targets one specific area. It is always the patients choice. The nerves, muscles and structures of the shoulder are connected to and controlled by the nerves in the neck. We feel ethically bound to give you the whole picture and let you make the choice. We want patients to be fully informed. It would be a disservice to not tell you that. We have been in practice for over 36 years and feel obligated to care for the whole person, not just one part. However, if you had shared your views to only have your shoulder cared for, we would have structured our care plan to meet that need. I am sorry we missed the mark. I hope you find the care you are looking for. We wish you a healthy future.'}< /response>

< Review>
I started treatment at Dilliard Chiropractic about 1-1/2 years ago.  I had several painful areas in my back and especially in my right hip/groin area.  I had voluntarily quit driving 3 years before because I has severe "seizing-up" type cramps and I was fearful of being involved in an accident.  My main goal was to be able to drive again and with treatments from Dilliard Chiropractic, I achieved that goal about 10 months ago!  I received a standing ovation from the whole office when I announced that I had driven myself to my appointment!  I still have a number of painful mobility  issues, but with the help of the friendly, helpful , amazing staff and Doctors, I look forward to my continuing improvement.</Review>

This is my first time to see a chiropractor! Always hesitant to see one because of fear. Just thinking of cracking your neck & back.... gives me the chills! Dr Dilliard was recommended by my friend... so I said why not to give a try. Consultation was free, which is a plus! Just had to pay for the X-ray. I didn’t know how bad my spine was after they showed me my X-ray & explained was going on.
I had my first adjustment & I felt the relief on the stiffness & pressure like feeling on my neck that’s giving the pain, tingling on my left arm.
Thank you Dr Dilliard, Dr Logan for helping me ease the pain. I still have a long way to go.... but I know I’m in good hand. The staff are very friendly & always make you feel @ home.
You guys are amazing!!!!</Review>

It has been years since I visited a chiropractor but a car accident led me to Dilliard Chiropractic. I was blown away by the professionalism, the use of technology, the character and skill of the various doctors, and the welcoming spirit of the entire staff.  The clean and well furnished office was very inviting, the therapy area is state of the art, and they have their own x-ray room and massage therapist on site. This place is the standard by which all other chiropractic offices should strive to become.  They are always ready for you at your appointment time, they listen to you and accommodate your specific needs, and most importantly they have helped restore my vitality by getting my body healthy in its own natural way.< /Text>

From day one, I received more care and compassion from every single member of the Dilliard staff than I have received since my back issues started more than 20 years ago.

After two months of treatment with Dilliard Chiropractic,  my back has felt better than it has in years; and, for the first time in years, I am hopeful for future progress.

Dr. Logan and Dr. Dilliard have been a Godsend, and I'm so thankful to have found them.  The office is run wth excellent efficiency, and all staff is friendly, knowledgeable, professional and caring.  I could not ask for better.</text>

I have never have written a review but must on Dr Dilliard , l came in with severe back problems and a fracture on my spine from use and abuse in Construction,  Army , and truck driving it was taking 45 minutes to get out of bed 2 weeks straight then l went in to get a adjustment l didn't care who l just need a adjustment  l got lucky and walked in Dr Dilliards office he was the one who found the fracture also he showed and explained what exactly was going on with my spine and he explained what his plan of attack was going to be, after 2 adjustments l was surprised with the noticeable difference after 2 weeks l was able to jump out of bed and start my day without hesitation or pain my insurance covered the cost.
My girlfriend had been seeing a Chiropractor for a year straight with very very little improvement after her crying after work 2 days in a row because of severe pain l told her to see Dr Dilliard she explained he was out of her network for insurance and l explained l would pay l believed in Dilliard and was confident he could help her and l was correct she is 90 percent improved and getting better everyday , the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable which only adds to the whole experience

So I stopped going here, immediately they make you feel comfortable at least Dr. Dillard does. I got in a major car accident and was treated well at my first appointment. I do have an attorney (that was not recommended by the office) but fault for the car accident has not been established. I was not asked if I had the money to cover the appointments it was just assumed by this blonde office lady that I was not going to have the funds to pay it. She spoke to me as if I were a problem and felt like I was being looked down on. (She also is very clear to be nicer to other patients than myself) Now they also recommended attorneys. So me being injured, loss of memory, have a concussion these imbasols force me into going down there when I'm not doing ok. I get down there to the attorneys office and no where was this man willing to help me and even stepped foot in front of me to block me from leaving after his denial to help me. I picked up my personal information and informed attorney that I would not be using his services. He blocked me from leaving his building I had to rip my papers all because he wanted record of me being there when it was already in the computers all while in excruciating pain. The papers had address SSN etc. Now I want to say that Dr. Dillard is a good man to start but then you just become a number. You are not treated by the same person. They write things in the computer like you're making progress when you are not. They don't speak to you about it and then there is a blind record. They take 5 min the crack your back but when you tell them what's going on they don't listen or just tell you to ice. (So am I suppose to ice my back for the rest of my life) So I've been icing my back since the 18th with no relief.  They told me not to take pain meds which I have not, I have been smoking weed and taking CBD because i have a life and need to manage the pain somehow. It seems he refused to want to put me on disability when I can hardly move or function like a normal human being. I unfortunately will be one of the people not to use them if you have been in a severe car accident. A. Because they have no patience. B. They are worried about the money and getting paid more than you and they will bring that up over and over again. C. All the office ladies are amazing except for the blonde one. I can't remember her name but she is rude. D. They diagnosed me with so many different things. I've been going to chiropractors my entire life and never been told I have any of the conditions that were given to me at this office. ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION! So after all this I will be moving to an alternate chiropractor that charges way less has a monthly flat fee for the entire household. I have to say I was excited the first day after that it just became a major headache.<//Review>

<review>If one can touch but one soul in a lifetime, it is a life worth living. Dr. Dilliard touched my soul and I am grateful forever to him. I was in an automobile accident and I went to see Dr. Dilliard. He treated me with care and professionalism. I later went to court because of my injury and Dr. Dilliard came and testified on my behalf. He was called at lunchtime and was there within an hour in the court room. He wasn’t given notice (he was scheduled to come the next court day). He just came, probably cancelling many appointments to do this for me. Without him, I surely would have received a lot less money from the insurance company, who clearly doesn’t value the preciousness of the physical body we have. I am quite limited in what I can do now, but I believe in miracles... Thank you Dr. Dilliard!<//review><Gmap_id>0x80d959caa23d39b3:0xd1e229307b06d397<//Gmap_id>< rate>

<text>The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly, the utmost care is taken to ensure your body functions at its maximum capacity. They are great at looking at all the symptoms and tying them together in a comprehensive rehab program for your subluxations. I do feel it is a bit expensive, and at times there seems to be a lack of follow up on things such as orthopedic shoes, which workouts to perform on my own, etc. These were all mentioned in the initial consultation, but no one sat down and fully explained them until I inquired again about them weeks later. Overall, a very trustworthy, informative and effective chiropractic care center.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Date>1548486644272< /Date><rate>5</rate><text>Sometimes words are not enough to describe thankfulness. I can’t say more than “Dr. Dilliard has magical and miracle hands that can cure everybody”. I got a sciatica inflammation and my case was extremely severe. I could barely walk, stand, sit, or drive a car for more than 5 minutes. I felt depressed because of my situation. I lost the hope of recovery until I met Dr. Dilliard and Dr. Logan.

Dr. Dilliard is one of the most capable chiropractors I have ever met. I am beyond impressed with Dr. Dilliard, Dr. Logan and their team. Dr. Dilliard, and the staff are very friendly, highly knowledgeable, and shows great care for their patients.

If you listen to his advices, you will definitely see results in your recovery. The only thing you need is time and trustfulness. Dr. Dilliard and Dr. Logan are great in looking at all symptoms as they have helped my body function well by enrolling me in a plan. They are truly experts with complex and sever cases.

There is no doubt about how happy I am of the care I have received from them. I would like to thank the staff including Ashlee, Hana, Jeni, Megan, Raylene, and Sabrina for their professionality and customer service skills. Overall, an effective and informative chiropractic team. I am so thankful for ALL of them.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I have used the services of a number of chiropractors over the years since 1989.  After gap of several years, I was referred to Dilliard Chiropractic.  Immediately, I was struck by the friendly, welcoming attitude shared by all staff.  Also worthy of mention was the extremely thorough initial examination I received.  The latter was unique among my previous encounters with chiropractic providers, and the former was, I have to add, a rarity in most offices!

Through many years of abuse to my lower back caused by previous jobs requiring the lifting of oversize, heavy weight, combined with my present age, Dr. Dilliard and staff focused on my areas of need.  As mentioned above, I had neglected my back care for a few years, and was feeling the effects of that.  Soon, the symptoms that were plaguing my posture and overall well-being began to show marked improvement which continues to be the case.

I would like to add that Dr. Dilliard and his staff meet not only the physical needs of patients like myself, but also, and of equal importance, the spiritual needs of patients are also addressed and honored, something that is so often swept aside in our present culture.  Added to this, Dr. Dilliard and staff approach their practice in a fully holistic manner, looking at all aspects of one's lifestyle and the effects on one's totality of health.

To conclude, I give my highest recommendation to Dilliard Chiropractic to anyone who is searching for an excellent, thorough, and caring chiropractic experience.< /Text>

A little about myself; I’m 29 years old, male, 6ft, 145lbs and had been diagnosed with stage 2 spinal degeneration which caused me severe neck/back pain and stiffness. I wasn’t happy with my current chiropractor so searched on google and came across Dilliard Chiropractic. I liked what I read in reviews so called to schedule an appointment for a full examination with x-rays. After a very thorough examination and review of the x-rays I proceeded to schedule a 12 month program of adjustments and physical therapy per recommendation of Dr. Dilliard. Needless to say after my 12 months I not only feel 100% better but my quality of life has greatly improved. The spinal degeneration has been stopped in its tracks and I couldn’t be more thankful. Dr. Dilliard and his highly trained and educated staff have been nothing short of professional, friendly and helpful will all my needs. Thank you to everyone at the office and I look forward to my continued treatment with this awesome team!

I just wanted to state that I was in no way compensated or motivated to leave a positive review but felt that I needed to share my story in hopes that it will help others. Most people hear chiropractor and immediately think “well I’m young and have no beneficial reason to see a chiropractor.” When it comes to your personal health, well-being and quality of life I would recommend Dr. Dilliard 11 times out of 10!

Thank you and God Bless< /Text>

I have not met a human as nice as Dr. Dilliard. Dr. Dilliard cared for a client of mine for over two years. We had to take the case to trial. Dr. Dilliard took the time out of his extremely busy schedule and thoroughly and patiently explained to me what the patients diagnosis were. On the day of the trial, we had to call Dr. Dilliard to the stand out of order. I called Dr. Dilliard at 12:15 p.m. for him to testify at 1:30. I could not believe and had tears in my eyes when Dr. Dilliard decided to reschedule his busy schedule on such short notice. Dr. Dilliard made it to the courthouse by 1:00 p.m. Dr. Dilliard is an angel, a savior, and a good human. Thank you Dr. Dilliard for your dedication, professionalism, and humanity. Thank you.<//Review>

At 37 years old I was ready to use a cane.

A series of progressive weighlifting injuries, coupled with a brutally physical job, had left me barely able to pick my feet up off the shower floor and wash them.  I could not extend my left leg without nerve tingling shooting through my entire left side.  I would come home from work and simply lay on my bed in pain.  I couldn't exercise.  I couldn't date.  I was becoming clinically depressed.

Six months later, I was healthier than I had been since my early twenties.  I have no words that can adequately describe the improvement in my life that Dr. Dilliard caused, and I can not thank them enough.

Chiropractors are like a most professionals: there are good ones, unremarkable ones, and bad ones.  Dr. James Dilliard is a healer and a miracle worker.  I joke with friends about him having the healing hands of Jesus, but it's not really much of a joke.  He gave my my mobility back.

Please go see this man if you are in pain and need fixing.<//text>

Best chiropractor I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing, Dr. Dilliard is caring & professional. His technique is by far the best. He takes the time to listen to his patients. He’s kept me mobile for 21+ years which is not an easy task considering all my physical problems. I highly recommend him.</review>

<review>We are so thankful we found this place! I have grown up going to Chiropractors and have seen many, but none compare to this office. I truly feel like Dr. Dilliard and all of the staff are fully committed to your healing & wellness and they offer a very wholistic approach to your care that brings actual change to your life and body! Dr. Dilliard is always very attentive to our individual needs and we have both felt a HUGE change from seeing him. All of my chronic back and neck pain has gone away and my husband is not living with on going pain anymore either!  We recommend this wonderful place on a constant basis to everyone we know.< /review>< date>

<response>None< /response><review>Dr. Dilliard has completely changed our lives. My youngest son was born with and suffered from severe acid reflux for the first 2 months of life...We tried 3 different medications in that time and I was actually told by his pediatrician to stop nursing and switch to formula to help him. Literally, since right after his first adjustment, he has been successfully exclusively breastfed. Dr. Dilliard and his staff have become like family and I could not recommend anyone better. From my newborn son to myself - my family's health has been forever changed for the better because of this practice.< /review></record>

<Review>I was referred to Dr. Dilliard in August by a friend.  I had my reservations about trying out yet another Chiropractor but was assured he was excellent, so I gave it a shot.  From the 1st appointment, Dr. Dilliard and his team of staff were very professional, yet personable and so thorough. I have seen and felt improvement with various problem areas and was so surprised when I went to my Dr's office and my blood pressure had declined as well.  What I really appreciate is that Dr. Dilliard does not do the same thing every visit and really hones in on the areas that need adjusting.  When I've experienced pain in new areas, not even spine related, he has taken the time to treat the problem and provide guidance to help heal it.  He and his team are definitely top notch in my book of Chiropractors!< /Review>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Dr. Dilliard has seen me through two bad car accidents, an ice-skating accident and the general wear and tear of being a human.  He's been working in the industry for a quarter of a century and adds to that experience a very high sense of intuition.  His staff is well trained to perform their jobs and to act as a team.

Just last week, while out walking, I did a full on Superman flying face plant in an intersection I was scurrying across.   I hit mostly on the left side of my body.  That is a recipe for spinal disaster.   Three quick trips to Dr. Dilliard and the damage was corrected.

I see people out in town that are walking with an awkward gait or a twisted spine.  I want to tell them to "Go see Dr. Dilliard!" That would be a little rude, but since you asked, I'm telling you! Go see Dr. Dilliard.<//Text>< Pictures>

He was very thorough during my first visit and was very confident about his knowledge.  I have been going to him since and have referred other people to him.  This sets him apart from all the other chiropractors I know.< /text>< date>

I have been a patient of Dillard Chiropractic for 12 years.  I would highly recommend Doctor Dillard to family & friends.  He has met me on a Sunday when my neck was so stiff I could not function.  My Sciatic problem has been healed.  Caring & wonderful staff.<//Review>

<text>Dr. Dillard and his team has provided excellent chiropractic care for me for 20 years. Dr. Dillard has helped me through two vehicle collisions, a broken foot, shoulder issues, neck issues and many ailements through the years such as colds, flu, surgery and other conditions not normally associated with chiropractic care. I continue to get regular chiropractic care from Dr. Dillard as maintenance to balance daily wear and tear from office work and general living. My quality of life as been greatly improved by regular visits to Dr. Dillard and I highly recommend Dillard Chiropractic to others.</text><Gmap_id>0x80d959caa23d39b3:0xd1e229307b06d397< /Gmap_id>< user>

I went in to see Dr Dilliard in November 2018. I had been hage pain and problems walking. At times I couldn't walk 10 steps, stand for 10-20mins, both without extreme pain or standing straight. I was going to another chiropractor for a year straight, prior to my visit. What he was doing didn't help. At the time, while in office I was fine but when I got in my car its like I hadn't had treatment or therapy. He was also only working on my L4/5 S1, 2 times only- he would work on traps. Since going to Dr Dilliard office- I'm at least 80% better and it's only been 3mo. I'm able to walk longer during work I walk 1.0 -1.5 miles, and then whatever after work. Before I couldn't go shopping to pick up my groceries without wanting to cry in pain or sit down for 15min, so I could go on.
My xrays also showed improvement in my neck C4 was starting to herniate - and my neck had a curve in it and it is showing that it's getting straighter. My spondylithesis - which is why I get the pain and had problems walking. My neck, thoracic, and lumbar have subluxation and it is getting corrected! With getting my regular treatments, therapy and home stretches,  I am sooo much better. Thank you Dr Dillard and Dr Logan for helping me!! You are both amazing.. The staff in this office is knowledgeable and friendly, they all make you feel comfortable, like you've known them forever. Thanks again.. Looking forward to more treatments n therapy 🤗👍🤩< /review>

< review>
I have been going to Dilliard Chiropractic for years. I started seeing him for my back in my early high school years. As a former high level athlete, I have yet to find anyone I trust more than Dr. Dilliard and his staff. Dr. Dilliard does an amazing job at familiarizing himself with the patients and knowing their issues on a individual level so that the care received is personalized. I spent 4 years outside of San Diego playing soccer for college, which really took a toll on my body. When I returned, he knew exactly how to adjust me just by watching my gait as I walked through the door. If you are in search of a Chiropracter, you will be in kind, caring hands at Dilliard Chiropractic.</review>

<Review>I have been under care by Dr. Dilliard for almost 2 1/2 years. I have three bulging discs in my back (T1, L4/L5, L5/S1), and the relief was almost immediate. I firmly believe (and tell anyone who will listen) that Dr. Dilliard has kept me from having back surgery.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1449263256075, 'text': "Denise, it's been my pleasure working with you over these past 2 1/2 years.

Dr. DiIliard and his staff are AMAZING!   They have treated my family and me since my 5 year old was 9 days old.   He has helped my babies with reflux,  ear infections,  feeding problems,  and sleep problems.   He's also helping me maintain my degenerative disc disease and preventing my arthritis from getting worse.   My functioning overall and my pain levels are greatly increased.   I have gone from using narcotics and lidocaine patches to minimal pain that can be controlled with basic home care.   When I've had some problems outside of regular business hours,  he is very responsive to calls and offers phone consultations or immediate treatment if needed.   He's greatly improved my quality of life.</text>

Amazing Doctor and staff who aren't just friendly, but who also truly care about your overall health and wellbeing!

I originally started seeing Dr. Dilliard about 4yrs ago for treatment of severe neck pain and bad headaches & migraines. From the 1st treatment, my headaches, migraines, and neck pain drastically improved to being almost completely undetectable.  I was able to do daily tasks and function like a normal person again.

I took a 3yr hiatus from treatment due to life circumstances which took my focus off of my own health care, and as a result ended up in the Emergency Room almost 2 months ago with severe neck pain.   After being pumped full of a cocktail of pain meds during my 4 day hospital stay, I was unable to sit, stand, or walk without assistance and I was STILL in a lot of pain.  I knew Dr. Dilliard would set me right again, so I went in to see him right away.  In a matter of days, he had me functioning back on my feet without assistance and well enough to drive again. Today, I am maintaining my personalized treatment plan, managing my kids and household and enjoying time in my garden all pain free!

Dr. Dilliard is my miracle worker and I am relieved to have him looking out for my health and wellbeing.</review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I have been seeing Dr. Dilliard since 2/2014. I used to have horrible chronic back and neck pain with migraine headaches and vertigo. After 2 years of seeing him 2-3 times a week the degeneration of my spine in my neck and back made major improvements. You could see the difference in the XRays, but more importantly I feel the difference. I feel great ! only occasionally due I feel discomfort. Sometimes my muscles are sore because now I can exercise again.
Dr. Dilliard really supported me through a couple of years of some wierd illnesses that stumped the doctors. His care was really a Blessing to me. The staff are great too.  Sincerely, Carol anne Drastal RN</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I've eaten a lot of ice cream in my life and this is some of the best I've ever had. There's a huge amount of unique flavors to choose and I haven't had a disappointing one yet.

Scoops are generous and the staff is friendly! Although there's been a line each time I've visited, it moves quickly.<//review>

<text>First time here and it was a little overwhelming on how many flavors were available, I had to pull up the flavors online to see what they were, but after we decided what we were getting, the payoff was worth it.  It was so good, this is the kind of place where you have to go once a week to try all the flavors.  I am betting that most of them are really good.  And as far as ice cream goes it's reasonably priced for the amount you get.<//text>< Pictures>

Holy cow!  That was great ice cream.  Their single scoop is bigger than a double scoop most places.  The price is right at $4.5 for the single.  The staff is very friendly.  Handel's gets 5 stars from me.</text>

What a great place to enjoy the end of my Mother's Day! This was awesome! This was my first time coming with husband and my three young children. The icecream sure was the best I ever tasted. We all ordered one scoops and it looked like we gotten three. It's was huge! This place has excellent customer service and the owners were the best. They came out to greet my family, which made us want to come back. I highly recommend this icecream shop to everyone.</Review>

Very friendly staff! My first visit there and I couldn't decide what I wanted. They made me a coke freeze with chocolate ice cream and it was so good. I will come back for sure. Many things to try next time.< /Review>

<text>The first thing I noticed was the clean look. Next I saw all the interesting, delicious sounding flavors! The employees were friendly and helpful and told us that we can try as many flavors as we wanted, so we tried a few. All were great!! My boyfriend got Tin Lizzy in a cone and I got Monkey Business in a cup. Both were amazing! (Although my boyfriend felt like it was a bit too sweet after a while.) You can really taste the quality and freshness of the ice cream, and you get a really generous amount for the price. I wish I lived in Folsom - I would come here all the time!!< /text>< user_id>

We used to love going here, great ice cream. Tried to stop by 3 times in the last 2 weeks and only 1 girl working. Waited over 15 minutes each time and finally left without ice cream. You really need at least 2 people.<//review>

Best ice cream in town! Handel's has so many delicious flavors, my only complaint would be that it's so hard to choose my favorite! They make new ice cream every day, keeping things fresh. The atmosphere is clean and organized, making ordering very efficient. They have nice outdoor seating, but there are tables inside as well. The service is unbeatable, and they're a great employer for teens looking for a first job. Lauren was especially great; she was able to memorize our order for 6 people in one try. Handel's has been a great edition to Folsom, and my family looks forward to visiting a lot this summer!< /review>

<text>Great ice cream. Only one time where a associate got distracted and mistakes what we ordered. She shorted us on our milkshake and when we asked for extra think we didn't get it and was charged for regular. Luckily my fiance and i were just enjoying our occasion but we both agreed to just make sure our associate isn't pulled away. This place is amazing however and one out of the million trips i have been there being a mediocre one proves that they are worth going to see. Love there milkshakes.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Some of the best ice cream that we have had. The consistency was creamy yet firm and every flavor we had was delicious. I reccomend getting the sampler bowl which comes with 4 scoops of different flavors.<//Text>

The 1st time I came here, I ordered the 4 scoop sampler to try different flavors and they were all amazing. They did not skimp on ingredients, there were so many whole pistachios in pistachio, whole cherries in black cherry, bug chunks of peanut butter and brownie and so much flavor in the monkey. Best ice crean I ever had.
The 2nd time that I came here, I wanted to bring my mom to try the pistachio and black cherry ice cream because it's her favorite. Unfortunately, there were were barely any pistachios in the ice cream; i was disappointed that I didn't prove to my mom that this was the best. Not sure if it was a hit or miss but my mom wasn't impressed, but she liked the black cherry. The peanut butter choco brownie was still good though. Hopefully the pistachio will be better next time.</text>

<review>Recently heard of existence on the news. Decided to take a drive from Sac and give them a try. Ordered a choc banana, pt of blueberry pie, and qt of Twister. Ice cream was thick, creamy, and super flavorful....look forward to trying other flavors. Choc banana seemed like it had seen better days but it was still a tasty treat. Hoping others come out to support during the Shelter in Place.< /review>< rate>

This place is amazing the ice cream is smooth and tastes like it came out of the old hand crank mixer. Staff was so friendly and helpful the inside and outside was clean and plenty of parking the only thing I would of like to have seen was maybe a thing of paper towels with a spray bottle of cleaned for the outside tables so when a family leaves the next family can clean the table<//review>

<Review>Oh wow. I would argue they are as good as Gunther's and definitely better than Leatherby's. Rotating flavors. Generous portions. Vegan and non-dairy options are available (but small selection). Worth the trip if you're in the Sacramento area.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809ae5fe6ab55385:0x700414bbc7d91ee4</GmapID></record>

<text>I found this place a couple weeks ago on the way back from Folsom Lake we frequent. Always looking for place to eat after and dessert. We usually go to gunter's in Sacramento but usually have to rush before they close, also there's leatherby's but their a rip-off and not that good. but this is lots closer and a good deal and selection of ice cream and different ways they serve it. So fun and full of yum!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Gmap_id>0x809ae5fe6ab55385:0x700414bbc7d91ee4< /Gmap_id><Rating>4</Rating><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

<Review>Best ice cream in town.
Also, in reference to the below bad review due to lack of social distancing.... this is an ice cream shop and their ice cream is delicious. I’m sure you can find social distancing at the local social distancing shop. Your review has zero reference or taste. Get it together, Karen.</Review>< pictures>

Went to Handel’s Folsom last night and was upset to find at least 30 unmasked patrons seated and congregated in front of the door. No one eating ice cream, just socializing. I had to excuse myself through a crowd of unmasked patrons to get to the door. All patrons inside also unmasked. While CA Covid-19 numbers are up 70% this is downright dangerous AND unlawful. Patrons are to have masks in public, and inside the building at a minimum. Won’t be going back until something is done about this.</Text>

Went there with my husband and son. The store was packed and was not enforcing social distancing. They did not have any system in place to keep the customers away from each other. There were only young kids working and not all of them were wearing their masks properly and a few with no mask at all. No management directing customers to practice social distancing? Not to mention the Dutch apple pie ice cream had zero flavor. Not impressed.  Get it together Handels.</text>

Our family LOVES Handel’s-the location, the vibe, the people, and above all the ice cream! We have our favorites like Buckeye and Oreo Dough, and in addition we get to enjoy free samples of any flavor we’d like to try! Hands down, Handel’s is the best ice cream around! -Collie family< /Text>

Absolutely amazing!!!! They have so many different flavors and they encourage you to try them all until you are sure you know what you want. I’m not typically an ice cream lover but I think it’s because I’ve never had homemade ice cream. So delicious!!!! Customer service is fabulous!!! Everyone was so friendly!! So happy to have a local homemade ice cream shop!!<//Review>

<Text>If you love choices & rich, creamy ice cream Handels fills the bill. Chocaholic Peanut Butter Ripple & Oree Dough. 1 quart of ea  because we couldn't agree on just one. Our visiting family agrees,  "it's the best ice cream, ever!!" The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, too!< /Text><user_name>Leslie Reed<//user_name>< GmapID>

Best ice cream in the area hands down! They have so many flavors that they all make in house- so they are fresh and so delicious. You get very generous scoops and they let you try all the flavors! I am so glad we finally have real good, homemade ice cream nearby! You will not be disappointed!<//review>

<Text>Ice cream was smooth and creamy. Single scoop was on the generous side; I would prefer a smaller size for a smaller price. It was good though, probably best ice cream in town.

Ambiance is really loud and echoes across the room. I went when a room full of sugared up kindergartners were there... Loud!!! I'd recommend a smaller size and something to muffle the noise inside.< /Text>< Rating>

< Review>
The ice cream is from a different world! Soo good. The staff is so friendly and helpful there is no pressure to order your ice cream. They let you try whatever you want! I went with Coffee Chocolate Chip because it was 11 am. It was special! My 9 year old said “best ice cream ever!” Folsom is lucky to have such a gem in our town.</Review>

To say these were good does not cut it, they were so creamy so fresh and so rich and amazing absolutely the best ice cream we have had in a while. The watermelon specifically made me want to put down any Jamba Juice and drive over to Handles to get a cup it was such pure fruit filled bliss.

Icecream is really good, very generous scoops, clean and nice atmosphere, and all the workers are nice. Caramel pretzel crunch is a must try! The girl with the Medusa piercing also knows what's in every single ice cream, I tested her while sampling all 50 flavors.<//Review>

I cannot express how excited I am to have this open in Folsom. The choice of flavors is overwhelming, yes, (although they are so friendly and happy to give you lots of tastes!), and having such delicious, homemade ice cream available close by may *not* be the best thing for my waistline (understatement of the year). But wowza. I can’t wait to go back this weekend and try a sundae!< /review>

handels in folsom is a super yummy spot! i went today AND yesterday! its well priced and their out of the box flavors are absolutely delicious! their milkshakes are to die for, yet they are only $5.50. if you go to cold stone, niche, snooks, etc. the milkshakes are smaller, more than $6, & mediocre.< /Text>

<Time>1626886571580</Time><rate>5< /rate><Text>this laundry is all new and featuring a Sanitizing System, which offers the best possible cleaning. Lots of big washers now and bigger dryers.
The washers are High Extracting and reduce dry time and waist of resources. Paying for equipment is now done by credit or debit or EBT or by phone app or, you can use your quarters.
They have promotions goin on now which are fantastic. They are on the 2 loads & 6 loads.

As for the rest, Dry Cleaning and Drop Off Wash and Dry is available and a new Drop Box is being added right now to make it easier to use 24/7.

There is a terrific staff now too.< /Text>< Pics>

One of the best laundromats in San Diego. I started going here about a week ago, they have top of the line equipment,  all the machines work and the staff is wonderful. Plus this a great neighborhood to get coffee, people watch, or grab breakfast while you're getting your laundry done.< /text>

Its because of the young lady work inside today.  I used the big machine for the first time and it was weird and I asked some questions about it and she was so bothered to leave her food to come and answer and she was rolling her eyes and answering like saying "did you bother me for that " I said it's your job so it shouldn't be a problem to answer some damn questions ! Horrible customer service with this kind of people who just wanna sit all day and make money !<//Text>

Staff is very very rude. The skinny one tries to run you over with the broom and seems like is breathing down your neck while washing, everywhere you in the laundromat she's right near you and does not let you wash in peace and seems to get mad when you throw a little piece of trash in the trash can after she dumped it out. Isn't thay what the trash is there for? The older staff member also rude, she told my 8 month old pregnant she better hurry up because the last wash was in 15 minutes in a rude tone<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Amazing quarter change machine . Different size washers n dryers. From $2.75 to $6.00 per wash.
I got there just after 7pm. Last loads at 7. The lady was really nice to let me wash 2 lg loads. I assured her it was just to wash. Its hot af outside, didnt need to use the dryer... I tipped her for being so nice.
A/c was on, its very clean. Get all ny dry cleaning and alterations done there for years. Right up the street from me on Adams ave. They also offer fluff n fold.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>This place charged me double the price when I picked up my dry-cleaning! No phone call, nothing. And would not release my clothes until paid. NEVER USE THEM, I know personally and professionally I have never encountered this. The theater company I run will find a new place to dry clean.</review></record></dataset><record>

<name>Sarah Tafoya<//name><Pics>None</Pics><Review>I use this laundromat fortnightly because it’s clean, has good snack machines, attentive but not over the top staff and plenty of places to sit while maintaining social distancing. There is plenty of space so if you’re looking for a COVID-safe joint, this is a good option.

I also use the bigger Speed Queen machines ($2.75 a regular load or $3.25 for heavy soiled) but on heavy, it takes way longer than the 44 mins it’s suggests on the timer. I’ve currently got a load in and It’s been on for 51 mins with 9 mins left on the clock. Just something to keep in mind if you’re tight on time but otherwise doesn’t make a difference because it doesn’t cost anymore 🤷‍♀️<//Review>< Rate>

If I could I give no stars, yes their a laundry house but can they atleast provide some hospitality. I went today got there exactly at 6.00 o clock and they turned me away when the sign said after 6:00. And it was exactly 6 o clock so you guys need to fix your sign and learn how to respect people who are bringing you business. Never have a felt so disrespected there but today the women worker was very rude honestly I don’t write these things usually but this was ridiculous honestly.</Text>

This used to be my favorite laundromat.  It's nice that they are upgrading the machines and renovating the place but the prices are just too high now.  The 2 load front loading washers are $3.25 and only go up from there!  They now have 3 sizes of dryers but the small only gives you 7 minutes per quarter so now I need at least 4 quarto to dry a load.  Sorry guys, lost my business.<//review>

Corner Wash is in a great location close to several bars and restaurants to occupy tour time. They also have off-street parking and WiFi. Avoid coming here on a Sunday afternoon! All machines will be in use and you'll have to stand around looking awkward with eyes like a hawk waiting for someone to be finished with them. Might have to shake your clothes out after using the dryer to get all the grass out of them that's left in the machine.< /text>

It's the worst laundry ever. First of all, the owner is the worst part! He has no sense of humility. Extremely rude!!! To top it up, the machines don't the job. They're way too old. Just bad in all sense!! Wash N Go Laundry is 1.4 miles away and worth the driving. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE.</Text>

<Review>Very clean, reasonably priced with lots of washing machines and dryers. There are coin machines for change and a vending machine for laundry supplies. There is an attendant on duty to help you out and there is also free Wi-Fi available. Dry cleaning services are also an option.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Been going here for years, but recently there have been a couple of employees who are very rude! Not at all customer service oriented! They actually didn't have any quarters one day and the woman working there didn't care whatsoever! Actually looked at me like so" what" and then gave me attitude. There have been times when the temperature in there is 80+ degrees! And as soon as you open a door, the worker there will shut it immediately!  Many times there are strange grease spots on clothing that I don't notice until after they are out of the dryer. I will not be going there ever again!!</text>< rate>

I've been getting the fluff and fold service here for years.  My company sends me to san diego for 4 months on an off.  We are reimbursed laundry reciepts.  I've always used Corner Wash due to its close location and good customer service.

I will never be returning due to the older woman that was working today.  While she was trying to give me a biblical lecture I politely told her I was an Atheist.  She argued and told me that it's not funny to say that.  I told her I am.  She told me she was sorry and was very rude toward me.  I left, but the moment I pulled out I felt immediate concern for my laundry and turned around to grab it.  She asked if it was something she said and I told her yes.  Instead of apologising she simply handed me my laundry.  She would prefer to lose business over polite religous disagreement than to accept I have a different point of view and leave it at that.</text>

This place has good customer service with the drop off and dry cleaning. The smaller washers are not very high quality and left some of my cloths dirty which is the reason for the loss of a star. They sell detergent and dryer sheets inside as well as a few other laundry knick knacks. They also have complimentart WiFi. Plenty of restaurants, a CVS, a Von's, and some random interesting stores are all within walking distance. I do laundry here weekly as I live only a block away and it definitely gets the job done.<//Review>

This place is a dump and homeless people from the park wash there clothes here. This place is so old and delapitated. It took months to get a soap despenser by their sink and when the did it was the cheapest they could buy. Everything is clean sort of. This place needs an overhall of everything. The only good thing is $2 per wash.< /review>

This place sucks! The workers are known to harass their customers. I have been insulted, called names, and judged for the way I look despite being a paying customer. I have heard  numerous complaints from close friends and neighbors about this place as well. Will not be coming back to this business even if it was the last laundromat in the world.</review>

<text>We were desperate out-of-towners visiting the area for less than one week.   We needed help, and needed it fast!   On Monday morning we limped in for a miracle, so we could get back on the road, safely.  Jim and Virginia took great care of us and gave us the temporary fix we needed.  We would have loved for them to permanently fix the car, as the quote was reasonable, but time was not on our side.   Professionalism, knowledge and such a willingness to help us, is such a treat in these crazy times in which we live.  Can’t imagine anyone else who could have helped us better than they did.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I had my car painted with minor bodywork done here for a very reasonable price. The work that was performed is outstanding. The owner Virgina is very nice and professional. The place is clean with plenty of parking spaces. The job was completed in two days! I highly recommend this place. My parents are getting their car painted here too.< /Text><Time>1623362339657</Time><response>None< /response>< Pics>

They make things possible where other shop can not. They eased my worries and even gave me a reasonable estimate. And as always the job was done superbly  as if nothing happened. The car was washed like new again. They did an amazing job!  I can honestly say that craftsmanship is NOT dead - I was extremely pleased with the job they did. Thank you, good job!<//review>

Brea Auto Body was awesome!! They kept me informed on all the stages of car repair and did a great job making it look as good as new. I’m hoping I won’t need another car repair anytime soon but if I do I’m definitely sending back where it came from. Thanks Brea Auto Body!< /text>

I just wanted to write this because my service is great. I like to go to the trails with my Jeep with my friends. However, I hit the side of my car. I looked for serval repair shops. However, a friend recommended this place for me. They gave me a way lower price then other shops were offering. As my repair was finished, I had some doubts because the price was low. I wondered if they cut any sides. Nope. Perfect. It seems as they put quality first. Thank you Brea Auto Body. You Rock.<//Text>

<Review>I recently crashed my car and like a normal person I went to my insurance. They gave me certain body shops to go to, so I did. I had 2 estimates before I heard of Brea Auto Body. Upon arriving, I was greeted with respect. Once seeing their estimate, I was a little hesitant. The other estimates from the other body shops were lower in price. However, they went through the estimate with me, explaining every step, and that's when I understood. Brea Auto Body uses genuine parts, straight from the dealer. The other body shops didn't even mention what parts were needed. And if I couldn't afford the  estimate, they would work with my budget. However, I was scared my insurance wouldn't work with them. And that's when I found out my insurance had lied to me. Brea Auto Body told me I had the right to repair my car where I decide. My insurance had told me to only go through these places. So I chose Brea Auto Body. And when I saw my car after it was repaired, I didn't regret it, knowing my car was fixed in the best possible way. Thank you for being honest the whole way through.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dcd56a0f687cff:0xf770c74c35cc76ab< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I took my car in after getting rear ended. Jim was thorough in his initial estimate, unlike the collision repair shop that was contracted with the other party's insurance company that barely even glanced at my car. You could tell they take the time to do the repairs well as the whole car looked light years better than it did before I ever had the accident. They try to use OEM parts as much as possible to truly restore the car to its former state. I would highly recommend them and would definitely use their services again in the future (although I really hope I don't need to).<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>For a woman that is 50 years old, I have a hard time finding a body shop. As I own a Honda, I went to their website and searched for their Honda Certified Body Shops.That’s where I found Brea Auto Body. They are the best. The end result is spectacular. My car came out looking brand new.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Most underappreciated body shop around. Most shops today are owned by big franchises that have a high over head and use inferior aftermarket replacement parts etc. They also are super friendly and honest , did I mention awesome quality! I know this because I work with a lot of body shops all over Orange County (vehicle graphics installer). Bring your car here , and you will thank me later!<//Review>< Time>

<text>Very professional and and very good quality. Right from the start they informed me that they use parts directly FROM THE DEALER for the best quality possible (if possible btw). They work their way around your budget as well. Overall, it is very recommended.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd56a0f687cff:0xf770c74c35cc76ab</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Work done on my 2019 Lexus was very good. It took almost a month to get a rear ended, but not a serious(?) damaged car. They said it's because of the delicate job with sensors and hidden devices.
While doing this extended repair work, the communication from the shop was not enough.
---------------------------------
I visited again to fix a couple of minor things. They worked promptly as a warranty service and very responsive to make calls.<//Text>

<text>Jim and Virginia made me feel “at home.” Jim discussed everything with me. Jim brought me back to his computer/desk and completely gave a honest diagnosis and repair. Virginia offered cold water and paid for a UBER trip. I picked up my car on-time and looked better than the day I bought it. This body shop is to be trusted.< /text><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Very fair and straight forward. Brea Auto Body has definitely put me in a good mood. Was told by another shop that my paint could not be matched on my truck door AFTER they already  painted it. A friend told me to go to Brea Auto Body and they worked a miracle! You cant even tell my truck was ever damaged. I am beyond grateful< /Text>

<Review>Our family has been a customer of Brea Auto Body for over 20 years and have experienced nothing but the BEST IN THE WEST.  The recent negative reviews by some domestic terrorists also NON CUSTOMERS should have us all concerned for the safety of business owners throughout the county and state!!  These bullies are harassing multiple  businesses for no apparent reason just to bully and terrorize. Retaliation is apparent by these reviews.  The city of  Brea is also being harassed by these domestic terrorists.  Please ignore these anti woman owned business and also a minority owned business.  These false reviews lead me to believe that these bullies are competitors in the body shop industry???  Wearing masks is a good cover for their true identity!!!<//Review>< Date>

Virginia just because you continue to scream at people God bless you does not give you the right to act like a maniac. And God does not protect you from the coronavirus put your mask on. have some respect you're not special because you think you have a relationship with God I don't even care that you got upset it's the fact that you're not wearing your mask and you keep screaming about God as if that gives you some sort of right to violate people this has nothing to do with God I hope you go out of business today</Text>

Just picked up my car after a great job of Virginia and her team replacing my front bumper on my 2017 Honda Accord.  It's like new!  The customer service throughout from the beginning to the final return of my car was exceptional. I was given every opportunity for feedback and they even sent me home with some helpful reminders for me in the event of another accident.  I totally recommend them to anyone who is looking for the very best in a Brea auto body repair service.  It's easy to see how they've been so successful and number 1 for so many years....

I have never trusted anyone in the auto repair industry...that's UNTIL I brought my car to Brea Auto Body!!

I have taken my car their for repairs twice and I will continue to take my car there as long as they are in business! If I ever move to another state and my car needs repairs, I will drive or have my car shipped here for the repairs.

Lets start with Mark Longo. I have never trusted anyone with my car like I have trusted Mark. His knowledge and professionalism is world-class. He kept me abreast of the repairs throughout the whole process from start to finish.

If you are used to taking your car somewhere and being pressured into service, I can assure you it is not like that here. You'll never feel pressured, you'll never feel stressed, and you'll never feel as though you are being taken advantage of.

That leads me to the office staff...hands down some of the nicest most capable people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. John gave me a ride home when I dropped the car off and was an absolute pleasure to talk with. Wendy was bright, cheerful, and professional each time she called with an update, and the owner was more than generous when I picked up my car.

Do yourself a favor and avoid the headache of taking your car anywhere else...

Brea Auto Body is the ONLY place to take your car if it needs repair work done. Period.

Thanks for the great service guys and gals! While I hope I don't need to return back with car damage anytime soon, I am happy to know that if my car is damaged, I somewhere I trust to take it for the repairs!<//Review>

<text>Professional, quick, and very courteous. I went to have a lining in my car looked at as it was falling off. The repair guy put in a few clips and took care of problem immediately.  I also got an estimate of a dent. They explained the work that was required in detail and why it cost what it would. I decided as old as my car was, it wasn't worth it. But I would definitely recommend this place.<//text><rating>5<//rating><name>Cami * (Cami)<//name><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Visited Facebook campus with family and had a great time. Loved the infrastructure and the amenities offered here. Work culture is a perfect blend. Had lunch in their cafe, desserts at sweet shop and fresh smoothies as well. Saw the offices and the grand tour was just fantastic. Instagram booth is a must to stop by for a picture.<//review>

<text>a ride, if possible evening, along the road leading to Facebook, some quick photos of the sign and a trip around the building. nothing else to do but if you have time it's still fun to take some pictures here. nearby there are fast food restaurants open until late at night, so go quiet, go by, eat and go find a place to spend the night :)< /text><Gmap_id>0x808fbc971bf5510b:0x4ac78421936e390c<//Gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXXv_aTk7Sg1C_j_qtP_PFVhH4HNvMSVuGHug9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP081WuKreomvNYdDKTrJZcfU1a0_PcmAZ0e7XM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiVRadsD2uRVJ-fsMIRyhJ-XYyp6kyWcGyqUMp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSi4aS51iJTUV-30VmselenMAn_QYh7A3_e_zB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Date>

If I could give Facebook headquarters a review of 0 stars, I would.  But it looks like Facebook turned off reviews for their main headquarters, so I pick building 15 to leave my review.  Also, it is just about impossible to reach Facebook via phone.  I recently deleted my Facebook for many reasons, privacy, political bias, and just the fact that it rots your brain.  My life is so much better without it.< /review>

Social Networking plays an important role within our global society. It allows individuals to connect with each other, keep in touch with old friends, and gives society the ability to explore your interests and hobbies. The famous social networking site, Facebook, has swept the social media scene since its establishment in 2004. Recently, Facebook has accumulated billions of dollars in the global market. Shandi Raice reports that Facebook’s worth will rise to 140 billion dollars by 2015.  Mark Zuckerberg, the creater of Facebook, was named Time magazines man of the year in 2010. Zuckerberg created this social network in the dorm room of Harvard University and the network spread like wildfire.
These issues include privacy concerns and censorship, psychological distress, and inappropriate content. First, I will go into the privacy concerns associated with Facebook. This social networking website allows the user to customize information on their profiles allowing the website to send them information that may appeal to them. Facebook only sends information that they think the user will enjoy. Facebook interprets the user’s particular interests and presents it to them in an easy to read website page called a “news feed.” This news feed only present information that Facebook’s believes the user will enjoy but censors information that would not be appealing to the user’s particular interests. For example, I was accessing Facebook reading articles that were posted from many on my conservative friends. I have one liberal friend that presents articles with interesting points of view on many of our current politicians.< /Review>

<username>XianMin Tang</username><UserId.>111661630095513867442<//UserId.><Text>(Translated by Google) I visited Facebook today and listened to the company's introduction. The image is profoundly that the company offers a lot of benefits, such as free employee laundry, and free dry cleaning. The company has three meals, and guests can enjoy free meals and wines. Female employees have paid maternity leave for six months. The benefits are so good!

今天參觀了臉書公司，聽了公司的介紹。映象深刻地是，公司提供的福利很多，比如，可以免費幫助員工洗衣服，還有免費干洗服務。公司包三餐，帶客人來訪都可以免費吃到飽，還提供酒。女員工六個月帶薪產假。福利真好！</Text>< Rating>

I had an excellent dental visit at Bright Now Dental in Hesperia. They are doing the procedures to keep you safe during this pandemic. They are professional. I get in and out of their in a timely manner. I like the new dentist. I leave their dental office feeling very pleased and knowing my teeth are in good health.
Thank You Bright Now Dental Staff! Debbie</text>

<rate>5</rate><review>Nice facility, everything looks new. Covid safe.Friendly staff. The Doctor gave me  options concerning  my dental work.  Let him know I wanted him  to repair the teeth in question. After his  examination  he told me no problem. I  received an estimate that was very satisfactory.  Just waiting now to get the work done. I've had extensive dental work done in the past.  This Doctor is friendly, knowledgeable  and calming . I've been looking for a Dentist that I could feel comfortable with. I'm glad I joined Bright Now.< /review>< pics>

<review>I came in here about 4-5 years ago cause of a really bad tooth ache that ive had dealt with for weeks and i called and no one could get me in the same day. I called Bright Now! Dental and they not only got me in that same day but made the pain go away. I ended talking to the female dentist lady( i forgot her name) and she helped me get everything all set up with medi-cal to get me a full set of dentures for no money out of pocket and they look absolutely amazing. Ive never had a perfect smile before and now i do. Boosted my confidence up a million times. Thank you so much to the awesome staff there. I will be coming in soon to have a new set of lowers made. Cant wait!</review><Resp>{'time': 1616347024524, 'text': 'Hi Patrick, we appreciate you leaving us a review.

Service desk Isabel, usually I have the other ladies assist me. Isabel called prior to verify insurance if not will cancel appointment, I understood. Than I returned her call and provided her the information she mentioned she will call back either way. Instead later on I called her to confirm everything okay for my appointment. Day of appointment Isabel acted as if she didn't talk to me over phone and had a different girl verify my insurance day of appointment as she didn't verify. So clearly I was not seen at my scheduled appointment time and back tracked on time due to Isabel lack of work and doing her job prior as well having another girl verify the day of my appointment. Perhaps management needs to give Isabel a talk or an updated class on her job and working the front desk and running information.</text>

<Review>Bright Now Dental is a very clean and professional dental office. Dr Marco Castilanos is a highly skilled, patient and gentle dentist.
Going to the dentist has always been difficult for me. Dr Marcos has helped me with breaking through that fear. He explained everything he was doing as he worked on a very difficult tooth. He was very good with his staff as he explains to them why he needs the tool or what every the assistants are handing him.
I would highly recommend this dental office to everyone I know.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Do NOT I repeat do NOT go here!!!! After using this office for several years by myself and 4 children for all service including braces I am done! They have verified the wrong person's insurance, rescheduled after I walked in the door and now refused to give any type of emergency care for a child in absolute pain. The lack of intelligence and even empathy by the office staff is absolutely ridiculous. They have been consistently rude and unprofessional multiple times.< /text>

Staff at front desk miss informed me multiple times causing me to waste my time and miss work 3 separate times because they didn't communicate they needed a form and other times because of  insurance, saying they needed a letter from the insurance. When providing a letter from the insurance clearing up there issue they did not accept it. Dont waist people's time, inform them properly and most importantly know how to do your jobs efficiently. Especially in a time like this not everyone is fortunate enough to afford and miss 3 days of work to not be taken care of.<//text>

The staff was friendly and helpful. They did their utmost to try to protect their patients and themselves from COVID-19. Throughout the appointment, from signing in a new patient, taking x-rays to the actual cleaning the staff acted very professional. The office was very clean. Gave 4 stars only because of the wait time past the appointment time in the sitting room and then in the dental chair. This, though, isn’t enough to stop my husband and myself from continuing to use Bright Now! Dental for our dental needs.<//Review>

Hating dentist so much I was hesitant to even go in because of prior bad experiences but I told them I hate the dentist and I get really nervous, so everyone made sure I was doing okay throughout the process of my root canal. The Dr. there is great I didn’t experience anything near what other people complain about with root canals And my temporary crown stood on during the covid madness months that I couldn’t go back to put on my permanent crown. My husband also went in for treatment and was very happy with the service. Overall great office with great staff< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I love this place. My daughter got her braces here because they quoted us the lowest price. The orthodontist is awesome, he’s super nice and always explains everything to us before he does it. He tells my daughter what she will expect to feel and what the outcome will be. The place is always busy but we have never been waited more than 5 minutes in the waiting room. Once my daughter is in the back it’s super fast the orthodontist comes in, goes over what the plan is and what’s to be expected. He’s quick but not in the way where you feel rushed and unimportant. He’s always talks so nice and kind and is personal with my daughter. The girls come in next and do the work and they are just as quick and equally as nice. We are usually done in less than 30 minutes for everything. Every time I leave I’m always saying, dang I love this place, I’m so glad we came here.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< review>
I'm really glad I decided to come here! The women up front were so sweet and efficient. I needed x-rays done and was there for about 1.5 hours. I was still waiting in the lobby for about 35 minutes after my appt time and had gotten there 10 mins early (not a big deal at all, I was prepared to wait a lot longer lol). The girl up front apologized for the wait & told me they were having an issue with the machine but she continued trying to make sure I was seen asap which was really sweet. The only thing I think could be improved is that I wasn't told what was going to happen or what to expect next- so I definitely felt a little confused at times. However, I really liked the staff here- very kind people! :-)</review>

IAM not trying to be rude or anything but every time I go there I somehow end up getting cavity's filled in and I have been going here for a long time but recently I went I they found an obscured amount of cavity's In me , that really bothered me but anyways the next day we came in to get the rest filled in and there were fussing on the amount that needed to be filled in and as well the dentist filled them in to fast which was a bit susposous as well my mom also had an appointment that day to get a cleaning done but long story short it did not happen and we just wasted our TIME and MONEY😠😠 and then the assurances lady came into explain saying that our assurances did not want to pay for it , bit the point is that I really do not like that lady addituide or explaniton or her as well and I read slot of the comments complaint about her and I totally agree with them< /Text>

I paid upfront over 2000 dollars which included a deep cleaning, 3 extractions, and a partial denture. Everything was going well up until my mother in law went in for the extractions. Keep in mind that when I filled out the new patient documents, I stated that she is diabetic and I listed all of the medicine she takes. The day she goes for her procedure they tell her that they were going to refer her somewhere else because she has diabetes. My mother in law decided she doesn't want to get extractions anywhere else, therefore the dentures will not be needed. And the woman in charge of the financing in the Hesperia office does not want to refund my money. They completely skipped ahead and made the dentures KNOWING that she has diabetes, and knowing that they would not be able to extract her teeth. I am beyond upset. The woman I spoke to was extremely disrespectful and had the audacity to tell me that she was not going to refund me the money because the dentures are already made. That is not my problem that's was their mistake, for not checking the file ahead of time.< /text>

Excellent service and the staffs care a lot about their clients.  They done great job on teeth.  They very careful in each step to be sure your not in pain doing the procedure and after.  So far after my surgery I only took one time pain medication.  I highly recommend Bright Now< /text>

I think this may be the first time in my whole life that i didn't need to get sedated for dental work. I got two fillings done in less than 20 minutes and every person there today was just so genuinely kind and understanding about my anxiety.<//Review>

My experience at Bright Dental was very positive. The receptionists were pleasant and answered all my questions, which put me at ease. The dentist was so kind and personable which made me feel I was in good hands. Everyone made me feel welcomed. I recommend if you are looking for a good dentist try Bright Dental.<//review>

I would recommend Bright Now Dental office for a check up, if your having any problems with your teeth, or for any other reason. Its the best office you can go to trust me. They can help you with finance as well,  very good Doctor she takes care of every patients needs. They took care of my pain on the sameday and helped me with finances.< /Text>

I love the dentist here at Bright Now, she is so gental, sweet & caring. She always asks if I'm OK. Hard to find a dentist up here in the Victorville, Hesperia area that will take their time, but she does. The office staff is super friendly. Parking lot is a nightmare, but a small price to pay for a good caring dentist.<//Review>

The doctor who extracts wisdom teeth is only there on Thursdays and they are the only one. So wait times are 2-3 hours... (thats just being in the waiting room) and you HAVE TO have a person with you there the whole 3 hours. They can't just pick you up. Then after my procedure was done they rushed me out of there without even letting me see the 2 teeth they pulled<//Text>

Great service, it was my first time here and it was Nice and friendly. I came in for tooth pain on my upper tooth and was told I would need my wisdom teeth pulled so made an appointment for the extraction, 5 to be exact. When I came in for my extractions I was really nervous, wasn't really sure what to expect but was in and out within an hour the dentist here is no joke he was all done in less then 10 min, I was really surprised how fast he gotem all out. Would recommend to my family and friends .</review>

From the initial call to the entire visit this was by far my most pleasurable experience at a dental office. I felt listened to and actually cared for. The entire staff so far has been amazing.</Review>

Everyone in this office is very friendly and eager to help every patient. My daughter didn't have an appointment but had very bad tooth pain so I took her and they rushed her right in and took care of her. They listened to my concerns and explained everything. The staff is extremely professional and down to earth. I was very satisfied and will refer everyone in my family. Thanks bright now dental!!!</Review>

This dentist is seriously, the best. They truly care about there patients on a completely different level than other dentists. I have recently been in there for a number of things, and just recently I have had 3 teeth extracted, and from that day until now (just 2 days later ) I have not experienced any pain at all whatsoever. I haven't had to take any medicine for pain. The doctor who pulled my teeth was extremely gentle and I didn't have pain. They don't just try to hike up your bill to get money, they only do what they NEED to. Let's just say, I won't be going anywhere else.</review>

Came in this morning for my permanent crown at 10am (I'm on time)...20 mins later no status. I ask receptionist for status... it'll be another 20 mins for a room to open.  WHAT?!!. I've already paid for my work and waited 2 weeks.  Scheduled for Tuesday...next week.  Looking for another dentist, recommendations?</Review>

< Review>
I am almost 38 yrs old and have been deathly ill for many many years and at one point I was taking 27 different medications all in one day. Well, no one tells you that no matter how much you clean and take care of your teeth, all the medications was slowly eating away and deteriorating all my teeth. One by one they started crumbling and they could not be repaired. The news from the dentist shocked me.... Full set of removable dentures. I was in so much shock that I kept putting it off month after month. I have a 7 year old who thought it was funny that she was loosing teeth and so was her mommy. At that point I stopped I stopped smiling. And I was constantly getting infections in my mouth and the pain that I experienced 24/7. I felt like I owned stock in every pain killer out there. Then I met Dr. Staudhammer and not only is she the best dentist out there with the most loving and caring attitude that clearly shows through all of her staff but also Isabella. Somehow they worked a miracle for me. I could not afford full set of dentures but somehow they worked with me on that also. There is no other dentist that I can recommend to anyone. I cried for months every time I looked in the mirror having just a few of my own teeth left. I used to be in my church choir and was involved in a lot of functions. Then I stopped doing everything. I was so embarrassed to even talk to people that I have known for years. Now, because of Dr. Staudhammer and her loving caring attitude about each and every patient her staff also does the same. You have helped given my life back to me......THANK YOU soooooo very much to everyone involved in case. You are all BLESSINGS to me.</Review>

If I could give ZERO stars I ABSOLUTELY would. This place is a nightmare! The office manager is incredibly rude and incompetent! How she still maintains this job is beyond me! She needs to be reprimanded by upper management.< /Review>

they only got one star because they dont have a negative selection. as where they did ok work the staff there is highly incompetent and automatically charge you for work that has not been done. they are argumentative when you call to straiten it out and blame the finance company so when you call the finance company they blame the one in charge of billing at the office. i wouldn't recommend this place they cause as many problems as the teeth they fix.</Text>

Their customer service sucks,. I figure this was a one time thing or just a bad experience but I have come to realize  they just don't have any customer skills. We are stuck with a contract  If not we would just Pay the extra money and go with a smaller Ortho vs this franchise with no customer skills.< /Review>

All these people are interested in is upselling you. What a joke. Serious investigation needs to be done into this place. Went one time, said gums were great. Went 6 months later and told me I needed gum treatments for the rest of my life. They even refused to provide me with the services I went in for (a routinue cleaning) but they sure will send insurance the bill for it.  Explanations are not clear, and yes, always something not covered by insurance. Would like to get their statements in writting. The "finance person" is pushy and somewhat rude, not a diplomat or helpful in the least-- thank goodness I have the calrity to ask for clarification otherwise I would have been left with thousands of dollars out of pocket that she thought was covered (be aware when you sign that statement that says you will be liable to pay for an expenses not covered by insurance, in this case, she would have verbally told me something and if I did order the services, I would have been out soooooo much $$$$$$$$$$ out of pocket). Waste of time and money to go here, save yourself the trouble unless you are totally covered by the wonderful government of ours--then, who cares, let em bill for whatever and continue to drive up medical and dential costs for everyone else, right?

These dentist are obviosuly under pressure to upsell. Be aware of chains like this one--- find an independant dentist and not one at a sham like this one. If you go, get their statements in writting so they can be "found out" eventually. Independant dentist care about their reputation cause that is all they got, these dentist are backed by corporate, so they have a shield around them for their sales routines.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!< /Text>

I had 3 watches that needed batteries. Because of Covid I hadn't been able to get it done.  I've used this store several times in the past for watch batteries and repairs so I went right to them and wasn't disappointed.  He also repaired the clasp on a bracelet today as well and it looks like new.   I will definitely go back.< /Text>

So I love this place. They were super fast and it only took an hour.  I had to get my size 7 ring down to a size 4.75 so they were wonderful.  I only gave it a four star because the people weren’t talkative and warm haha but the service was excellent.  Thank you for getting it done. I’ve felt literally naked without my wedding ring. They took great care of my ring.
Great business.</Text>

Hers needed the diamond prong repaired from being bent out of place and  I needed my wedding ring and engagement ring resized, it is one band that nests into the two others. They were  very busy and managed themselves perfectly and got both done in a little under two hours and very reasonably priced. They polished and cleaned them as well. Very happy and would definitely recommend.< /Review>< Rating>

My husband bought me a beautiful diamond and saphire ring at Costco and it was brand new just purchased 20 minutes before arriving at the Fast Fix store. Fast Fix Palm Desert said they could size it down no problem to a 4 and a half from a 7. When he finished it was oval, not round and too big. It was also all scratched from him using a file. He managed to make my ring warped and full of scratches in one hour for over $130. He wanted to charge me an extra $150 to add a spacer since he said he couldn't size it down any further. I was left with a ruined ring that cost over a thousand dollars. Don Victor came to the rescue, sized it perfectly, and took out all the scratches Fast Fix made. They are magicians and I trust them with my diamonds and saphires.< /Text>

This was not just effective but pleasant and a happy feeling, a family business and it felt like you were part of the family. The lady, boss lady even understood my English sense of humor. The job was done well and not overly expensive but good value. They are worth the effort to visit.</review>

Fast Fix was easy to find. Roberto was very
Professional and kind. I have hearing aids so when it's loud  it makes it difficult for me to understand what people are saying. My ring wil be ready for pick up in just one week. Very pleased with the service.<//review>

<Review>Your guy ( Jose?) Was not very friendly or accommodating  for a very quick and easy battery change...especially for charging $20 for a $5-10 EASY FIX!!!.  This store used to be my go to store for repairs and purchases. I often recommended it to my friends as well But NOT any more ... I won't be back again!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I had several rings that needed Resizing. They were fast and they polished the gold and some
Stones which had become dull.  They did a fantastic job at good prices.  I recommend them highly!</Text>

<Text>I took 4 watches in a few weeks ago.  The gentleman was friendly and kind.   The work was excellent,  each cleaned and wrapped individually when I picked them up.   Also, he delivered in the time frame he told me.  Will definitely return.< /Text>< Date>

Fast fix always gets the job done. I have used them twice to size sterling rings and again today to get batteries and a new watch battery on our high end watches. Mike is quick to respond and did our batteries in just a few hours.
Thank you Mike and the Fast Fix team!</Review>

I recently got engaged, but my ring was way too loose that it would fall off my finger. I decided to go here since I saw lots of good reviews and it was in the mall as well. I dropped off the ring and they told me it would be done in only 40 minutes! I went to go shop around while I waited. I picked up the ring and it looked the same, I can’t even tell it’s been resized other than the fact that it fits now! Thank you!< /review>

< Review>
I have had 3 watch batteries replaced, all with a 5 year warranty.  One of my watch batteries stopped after 18 months.  I went back to the store to have it replaced in February.  I was told it was not under warranty anymore.  As I did not bring my receipt I didn't argue with the sales clerk.  They replaced my battery and charged me $24.95 for a 5 year battery.  When I got home I checked my receipt and I had purchased a 5 year warranty.  Unfortunately Covid-19 hit and I was not able to get back to the store to ask for a refund for several months.  When I finally got to the store,  I was told the manager was not in and to come back.  I kept phoning to see when the manger was in.  It seems he only comes in once a week (maybe).  On June 13/20  I finally met with the manager.  He said he would issue me a refund.  They also changed the date on the battery so I only have 3 years left.  It is now August 11 and I have not seen any refund on my credit card.  In my opinion, the person who changed my battery out right lied about the warranty just so they could sell me another battery.  Now I have the manger Luiz, lying about giving me a refund.  Be careful, these people seems to be very dishonest!< /Review>

<Text>This place is awesome! Everyone is so friendly. I went in today to get my engagement ring repaired and yeah sure their sign says “fast” but I tempered my expectations. We received a warm greeting as soon as we walked in and were help immediately. Ashley gave us a pick up time of about an hour which my fiancé and I thought was super reasonable. Since the location is inside the mall that gave us plenty to do to kill time. By the time we hit the Starbucks and messed around in Barnes & Nobles the ring was ready. We went to pick it up and it looked brand spanking new! Ashley, the sweet lady that helped us, was just as excited as I was when she showed off their superb work. She even offered to clean my cheap old secondary ring. We will certainly continue to patronize this establishment. I highly recommend them. They do top of the line work with a super fast turnaround.</Text>< pictures>

This was our third time. As before, we brought in a half-dozen watches that had been in storage for years. Just batteries for most and repairs as justified.
Reasonable charges and speedy service.
Staff was courteous (but too young to recognize a Charley Tuna motif).< /Text>

<Text>My wife's wedding ring needed repair and we wanted to inquire about making a new ring to resemble a picture we had of a custom style using a diamond that had been in the family for many years. Luis was great and after conferring with Roberto offered the repair and to create a totally custom ring for us at what we considered a reasonable price. They called 2 days earlier than promised, and the results were amazing.
The wedding ring was repaired and never looked so good after 32 years of use. The new custom ring with diamond set was simply beautiful. This is a true custom jewelry store that also repairs. They are proud of what they do and customer service and quality of work is a 5.

<rate>4< /rate><text>Almost perfect job.

I paid for a new gasket for my lovely Noblia after a new battery was put it.

When I asked if it was done, I was told, “Nope, Sorry about”. It was replaced in a few minutes after te-opening the watch. The reason for only a little ding is that they readily admitted the inadvertent omission. And I would never have known.

The ready admission made them more than whole in my mind.!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I had my ring checked and cleaned. It had been 6 or 7 years since I had the prongs done. Fast Fix did quality, quick work with what I thought was a reasonable enough price. (I did not check anywhere else)

The cleaning was great too. I had forgotten how pretty and sparkly my ring was.
Thanks, Fast Fix!</Review>< response>

Had my ring sized at Fast Fix, and I thought a 1/4 size was all it would take. Came back 45 minutes later, and it was done - ahead of the hour they said to allow - but it was still snug. They adjusted a second time and didn’t charge me! The ring now fits fine and is beautiful! Very satisfied customer!

Second time I used Fast Fix I had a pendant repaired - excellent work, very reasonable price, and these guys are so easy to work with and willing to help.

Highly recommend!< /Review>

Wow! I was surprised by how easy it was to get my band resized on my new Bulova watch. At the same time I had battery replacement in two other watches. It was a little more expensive than I thought it should have been but they gave me a years guarantee for both and a small reduction in price for the service.
I browsed around in the mall for a half hour and came back and picked up my things. excellent.< /review>

Service was professional and fast. Rated 4 star because i can see where the soldering was done to increase the ring size and the spot is a little rough but doesn’t dig into my finger at this time. Hopefully it won’t be a weak spot.<//review>

Fast fix quoted me a price for a new battery, 5year warranty, a new crystal, and a new gasket to keep my watch water proof. The repairs were timely and when I returned to pick up my watch, they informed me my old battery was still under a previous warranty from them making the new battery free. I would have never known and appreciated the honesty. That’s a hard thing to find these days. I will definitely return for my next repair!!!< /Text>

<review>Fast Fix was terrific. They fixed one high-end watch. The other one I brought in they diagnosed for free.

Have had at least 8 great fix it tasks done by this store. The jewelery and watch services are really great. My last Effort with a Swiss watch movement was done perfectly a new movement and five year battery installed and back to Swiss time reliability. The lady at the store Geraldine was especially helpful in all
Regards of this being accomplished.
I’m glad we have such a reliable and quality repair store for Palm Desert</text>

To my surprise there was no charge when I went to pick it up because of the 5 year warranty I got last time I was there.

The prongs needed to repaired on my engagement ring. I did not have experience with any jewelers in the desert but based on posted reviews decided to try Fast Fix. The jeweler assessed the damage, gave a very reasonable cost and completed the repair in half the estimated time. He did a beautiful job, I give this business the highest recommendation.< /review>

<name>Elizabeth Sowles</name><date>1544813798911< /date><Rating>5< /Rating><text>UPDATE: The manager, Caroline, was understanding and helpful. She talked to me about ways that they could remedy the issue I had, but ultimately I was still unsure, and so requested a refund. She had to get permission (from the owner?) and kept excellent communication with me at each step (it took a couple of days for the refund to process).

I think this is a shop that does quality work from what I've seen inside, and the service is good, they are polite. Unfortunately, immediately after paying for a custom job yesterday, the clerk clarified something about the job that changed my mind about having it done. He said he couldn't refund me because it was a custom job, even though no work had been done, and he was still holding the coins that I wanted work on... I'm hoping that today a manager will be able to understand and refund me.</text>< Pics>

I came in to have some rings resized and was expecting to have to come back in a few days. They told me it would take about two hours! Didn’t realize they had a jeweler on site that was able to do it there. They sent me a text about an hour and a half later saying they were done and they even shined them for free. Glad I came here! Thank you!< /text>

Super friendly staff and fast service make this an easy choice for watch repair needs. The manager I spoke with during my last visit, Caroline, was outstanding and went above and beyond to provide some insights into how they price their services and made me comfortable to do business there. A+ customer service!</text>

I took my diamond & sapphire 2 carat ring to Fast Fix Jewelry and watch repair today Jan 8th. It was such a great experience with their manager Caroline that they deserve this review. So skeptical about leaving my “Real” diamond that Caroline took out an instrument and showed me it it real coming in and it will be going out. That is not the BEST part of this exchange finding out their prices very reasonable with quality work. Caroline reminded me to strengthen the prongs on the big diamond. Glad she did...the sapphire small stone is what I went in for. Thank you Kim<//Review>

Absolutely wonderful!  I had been given a quote of $378 by a different store to fix my ring but I had rejected it as it was more than I had paid for my ring on sale!  I picked it up and as I was walking down the mall, I noticed Fast-Fix Jewelry so I stopped in. They gave me a quote of $50 and 30 minutes and I got it back looking as good as new!  It was fixed and polished and on time. I know I will use them whenever I need another repair and I will certainly recommend them whenever I can!! Thank you Fast Fix Jewrlry as I can now wear my ring without fear of loosing the diamond!<//review>

Great customer service, friendly, informative and knowledgeable. I went to have my watch band replaced for my smart watch and clean it.The Manager (OMG I forgot her name!!! Sorry!) provided choices based on esthetic, functionality and appearance. She was very engaging and her advice was right on. She offered a better clasp that went with the leather band and did not charge additional for it. Very nice experience and very nice people.</text>

These guys suck. They wouldn’t even help me with my watch that fell in the pool. All I wanted was at least to open the watch to let the water out. They wouldn’t do anything. Unbelievable! So I asked if there was another repair shop near by, they said no! Liars!!! There’s one next door in the mall. Palm Desert Watch and jewelry repair owned by a super nice guy Louis. And Louis helped me right away and we saved my watched (and he didn’t even charge me!!!). Stay away from Fast Fix. Go next door to Palm Desert Watch and jewelry repair!!<//Review>

{'time': 1534814107192, 'text': 'My Apologies for your unpleasant experience, it may have been a miss communication, However drying a wet watch is a service that we do and we charge for it, because after the movement gets wet with water, it must be properly cleaned with special solution and re-lubricated, Also must be properly sealed and back close firm and tested, to insure the moment do not rust overtime and cause the movement to go bad to be replaced.\nSo opening a watch pouring water out and closing the back is what that shop owner did for you is no service but a disservice, your watch will rust and you will be back for a big repair job, because movement are costly,it depend on your watch grade.\nif that person had any knowledge of watch repairs he would not have done what he did to you! thatch why we get so many best off customer from that expert repair shop with rewind movements looking for a professional watchmaker at Fast-Fix jewelry and Watch repairs to get the right job done on their Watches and for the best service for a very good price.\nand That is why we do not refer any customers to that shop! hope you and the readers Understand.'}</Response>

How great it is to have a place where not only were they able to take care of my needs right away (nothing like instant gratification!) but based on our conversation I feel totally confident to bring my other watch which Movado Group failed twice to repair.</Review>

Westfield Mall location. Dropped by and very busy however I was pleasantly greeted by Dean.
I had asked if my watch band could be adjusted.
1/2 hour later done. I was very happy with everything.
Price was fair also.</review>

Fast Fix Jewerly And Watch Repair did an awsome job!!  The jeweler was able to adjust my wedding ring and all within an hour. Every where I went they would tell me they had to keep my ring for 2 or 3 days . When the gentleman told me it would take and hour and told me how much  it would cost I didnt hesitate and said Yes!!! I was so happy!! They even polished it , looking like brand new. I also bought a really nice necklace with a charm at a reasonable price. I highly recommend this place to everyone. The shop is nice, clean and all three gentlemen are very  professional, friendly and looking sharp. Definitely will come back again. Thank you!!!! You guys are awsome. I'm one happy customer.<//text>

I understand stand they said the movement is off , but maybe you could of said about fixing it.  But, then it could cost more then $19.95. So, I didn’t ask about fixing it.</text>

<review>I had one ring that had a broken band, another that needed to be re-sized and a necklace that was tangled beyond belief. In only 30 mins their jeweler not only untangled the chain that I and my boyf had messed with for a total of 4hrs without progress but also re-sized one ring and completely rebuilt my other ring's band. They did a great job at a reasonable price. I would definitely refer friends and family not to mention give them my business again. Thank you.<//review></record></dataset><record>
