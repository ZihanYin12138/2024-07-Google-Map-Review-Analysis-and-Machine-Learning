Fantastic place for lunch! My wife and I got a flight and sandwich. The flight would have been more then enough food for us, but we’re glad we got the caliente sandwich as well. Both were delicious, as was the house wine.<//Text>

Delicious sausages and very nice staff! We stopped by for lunch with a group of 4 and ordered the crazy bread, the pizza, and a sausage sampler. Everything was delicious and we did not leave hungry. The sandwiches looked divine and I look forward to trying one of those in their new location when we are back in Sonoma for our next visit.<//review>

<user_id>116265402799823432862< /user_id><Review>I wanted to love this place because it’s adorable and the employees - I think the owners- were super nice. The sausages, though, were pretty weak. Expensive for a “flight” and pretty flavorless. We had four different kinds and all of us thought they tasted pretty similar. There was also a beer one that promised it was spicy/hot....it wasn’t at all.  There’s no smoke on these and really not much interesting.</Review>< GmapID>

Only the best place for breakfast and amazing sausage sandwiches! Miranda and David have a hidden gem on the east side of the Sonoma Square.  Hidden in a small alleyway, you will be in for a mouthful of joy and deliciousness! The place is tiny inside but enjoy the seating outside.  Wine and beer make it complete.  Don't miss it!< /review>

Probably one of the best ham, egg and cheese croissant sandwiches I’ve tasted!  Bonus:  Delicious tomatoes with balsamic drizzle and good coffee to boot!  Cheers to the Sausage Emporium and here to success as a fellow Sonoma Small business!  Go check them out!<//text>

What a great little place!  Friendly people, good  food, perfect location

Just had lunch here. Tasty sausage. Small place, but you can get your food in a box and then cross the road the square.

Definitely worth a repeat visit<//Review>

Great place for a bite to go. The sausages were delicious. I don't get why they would serve such a horrible wine in the middle of Sonoma. No excuse for that.</review>

New Location Not Open Yet:
The place moved & I can’t wait for it to open!!!
Old Review from Previous Location:
This morning was my first visit to this place, (which is hidden away in an alley on the plaza). Two words: simply fantastic!
My “So Sonoma” sandwich w/spicy vegan sausage was so good that I am still thinking about it 10 hours later! My guy had Kielbasa on “Famous Chicago” and he loved it too. Not a lot of seating and no waiter service but you can take your sandwiches to the park inside the plaza or eat it in your car and enter a state of “sandwich ecstasy”. Such a nice “vibe” to the place”. Very Northern California and very Sonoma! Can’t wait to go back. (Which might be tomorrow! 😆)</text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>This smart and final store really deserves a 5 star rating due to the following reasons:

1. Selection is really wide and have everything and I mean everything that other supermarket has only at a  much better quality.
2. Prices are actually cheaper than a regular super market.
3. Parking is very ample
4. Customer service is friendly and helpful
5. Restroom are super clean
6. Other shoppers are even friendly which is a rare thing now days.

I highly recommend this particular store.<//Review></record>

<Text>Worst smart & final ever! They have rotten everything. I'm disgusted by their food and customer service is just as rotten as their food.. and I will be calling corporate on them... they better get it together! I wish i could give it no stars! Supervisors are horrible ... I will never shop or try to shop there again! I might even report them to health & safety.... everything had mold cauliflower, brocolli, bell peppers... ect ect... what a shame of a store...</Text>< Pics>

They are by far not a low price outlet . I wish they would get away from you having to buy  multiple items to get a reasonable price. They would be a great place to shop if they would accept their competitors advertised  prices on " same' brand items. "Food 4 Less" is still a good place for lower prices. I'm just saying!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Went yesterday to get some good food specifically fresh veggies, fruits and kids mid-snack. This grocery store is really nice and clean. You'll find all people respect the new 6 ft rule. Well, people have mask for protection as well. Good to know we are all taking care of ourselves and others too.</review>< Time>

Love this store!! I drive 30min to come here and enjoy every visit! Raymond from the meat department is super nice and has great tips on the variety of meats available. Every employee that walks past you says HI and the lines are never long! Store is always stocked and clean. Thanks everyone at this store for being nice and making shopping enjoyable! 💖</Review>

<gmapID>0x80dd331f7edeb2a9:0x14ffffc703253d92</gmapID><Review>Yesterday August 20 I came into the Smart and Final in Bixby Knolls #745 and purchased #202 the least amount of items I ever purchased. My issue was with my water purchase - I had a coupon 35 bottles for 1cent - great right ? Well I ended up paying full price - I had the coupon on my phone but the cashier was unable to scan it because she said “the coupon was not straight “so the little red light could not pickup the bar code, my mistake - I felt like my purchase wasn’t valuable enough for attention from management- she should have tried to make an afford to give my purchase at the discounted price instead she charged me full price to get me out the line — Very poor customer service skills- thinking on her feet should have been her job to help me and holding up the line should have been mine- but I’m one of those nice considerate seniors that people really don’t like spending too much time with - speak to her about this Jason it certainly would make customers satisfied and I do love this store it is always so clean and neat — Thank you.< /Review><username>angela robinson<//username><user_id>104867745633518544010< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

After years of periodically shopping for this company. This has been the worst shopping experience i ever had. When have cashiers scanned carts not one time but 3 times while i waiting in line. I asked cashier Adriana when did you guys starting scanning carts? her response was due to security. My next question was security for what? Cashier couldnt answer the question. To mind you the customer in front of me cart didnt get scanned at least i didnt see that. what a way to make a customer feel very uncomfortable. Im not the one to leave reviews at all but the feeling of being discriminated while shopping for your company had to be noticed. I will never recommend anyone to shop at this location. My first and my very last. I most definitely did contact corporate with cashier name and time i shop at this location. I couldnt get the other cashier to left of her name but im sure she will get notified as well. The second cashier to left of her stopped her whole transaction just to scan my cart. while she had a customer plus a line with other customers to attend to. Very un professional ladies having such judgement shows what kind of individuals you are.You both should not work at any company especially with that judgement towards people. You both need coaching better on how to elevate your customer service.<//text>

<text>Worst Smart and Final ever. I own a business so I come here a few times a week. I buy meet here often. Every time I come I have to ask them for more items since they dont check shelves. You have to buy 50 or 70 lbs of meat for the sales price bit they will display only 20 lbs and you will have to spend 30 mins asking and waiting to get more. 8 out of 10 trip I have to do that. Not fun.

Every time I buy items 50% off I always ask cashier to make sure they get it, even that only half of the time they do. You have to spend 10 mins waiting for them to get it right.

Today same thing, I wanted beef at 50 lbs for wholesale price but they had 25 and nobody was around. I cane up to cashier ( 1 cashier was opening) and the guy called meat department, he said he would go back and check. 10 mins unasked if he went to get the beef somewhere else or where why it takes him so long. Cashier said He doesnt know I will have to wait. I said Actually I dont have to and I walked out, left all items in the cart and bags. I just left.</text>< Pics>

Place is great but I have to complain about the raw chicken breasts, since I eat a lot of them. I've never had worse chicken breasts before. They're significantly more fatty, and have a lot of gristle and even bones from time to time. I hope they improve this soon. I usually have to throw away like 1/3 of whatever I buy.<//text>

I really liked this store until I was charged a different price for a pie that was labeled $3.49 and register charged $5.49! I didnot notice the discrepancy until the next day. I should have paid attention, but i was talking to the cashier who was complaining she was scheduled to work all day Easter Sunday. She has children. The point is this is dishonest. How many more products are charged more than the labeled price? NOT COOL, VERY DISHONEST! Bait and switch!!

So i decided to gv this store another chance. Twice i went back to have the alarm and cart freeze when i exited the door AFTER I PAID FOR MY ITEMS. I ALMOST TRIPPED ON THE CART. I opened my purse to prove I HADNT STOLEN ANYTHING. Well the cashier is supposed to scan the cart as well as your groceries so this will not happen.  2 times this happened to me. Seriously how many times do i overlook this?<//Text>

I’ve had the same experience but never reported it but to see it wasn’t just me targeted action definitely need to be taken because they can’t explain why they are scanning the carts    next time try hiring some people with respect and class discrimination isn’t cool I will never to back to this store</text>

<text>Disclaimer: I am a yoga newb. Indoor cycling is my exercise of choice, but I know that if I want to get any kind of fitness results, I need to switch up my exercise format regularly. I've been to Ritual a few times now and I'm still on the yoga learning curve.< /text>< pictures>

Personable and professional. Rather than building a studio that generates the same damn flow class in neat 60 minute intervals, Next is building a community of practice with truly experienced teachers. You can tell because the students actually interact with one another, whereas at most studios there's not even any eye contact.< /Review>

Nest Yoga has morphed from You and the Mat that opened almost four years ago. Now with a new name and in a newly built studio space, Nest has the best instructors and offers all levels of yoga for everyone. The staff and owner are all warm and welcoming. Overall the studio has a great community.<//Text>

Great yoga place, with large, clean, well kept yoga rooms. Teachers (the ones i’ve tried - about 4 of them) are, in general, knowledgeable and friendly. One star removed for setting up 90% of the classes as “all levels”. I understand that, from a business perspective, offering classes for all levels is probably one of the only ways to grow or make real money. But, still, this is enough to remove one star since for beginners is dangerous, as they are asked to perform poses they are not trained to do.< /review>

<Text>I think You and the Mat is a wonderful place. The offer of various styles and classes and times is excellent and the monthly fee is very reasonable. I particularly like the free choice of classes and the fact that I can adjust my attendance freely according to how my daily schedule and wellbeing unfolds. The studio rooms are spacious and light. The staff very friendly.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Gmap_id>0x80857df7801d0d1b:0x70621ffe66bcf94b<//Gmap_id><text>Reasons I like Y&TM:
•	Beautiful space with a simple wooden floor, lots of light, space, and fresh air.
•	A schedule that includes a lot of classes and times to choose from (7 pm is a good time for a class, for me).
•	Many classes that are suitable for all levels and that get back to the fundamentals of yoga.
•	Instructors who are friendly and down-to-earth. They won’t make you feel bad if you can’t do the splits.
•	Great intro pricing – a month for $49 and an even cheaper (ridiculously cheap) Groupon deal.
•	A lot of good-quality props that are made from sustainable materials.
•	Some donation-based classes for charitable causes.

I’m also giving them 5/5 Green Stars based on some of the reasons mentioned above.</text></record>

<Text>I have been practicing at You and The Mat for many years.  It is a second home to me and that is exactly what the atmosphere  and instruction lend themselves to,  a homecoming.  I recommend this studio and their instructors to anyone looking to find a real yoga practice.< /Text>< pics>

<text>You and the Mat has excellent teachers and staff, as well as a beautiful space that is very inclusive. I went to over 20 classes in a month and without a doubt every single class and teacher had something unique to offer. Sarah Moody's class on Friday (Yoga for Flexibility) is wonderful, she is extremely calm and it's a great way to start the day. Richard Rosen's classes are Iyengar based, so that means it will be different than a flow-based class, but there is so much to learn from his experience and the class is very engaging and I always feel great after. Margi's yoga for flexibility on Mondays is also one of my favorites. She always has many options for people of the different levels, and I always leave with a smile on my face. In total, I recommend You and the Mat to everyone, and I look forward to every class I take.</text></record>

< Review>
I love Nest. The teacher can focus on teaching and not on check-in. The studio is beautiful and clean. The classes are top-rate, and there are many choices in the day.<//Review>

Encinal Yacht Club has to be the nicest in Alameda. I come as a guest and the staff, facilities, and racing program are well known. A great scene since the post-pandemic reopening. Talk to a friendly member to join.< /Text>

<review>This is our club where kids learned to sail. On the Oakland-Alameda estuary. Will be interesting to see what new highrises across the way will do when they are completed. It's a long ride out to the bay for bigger boats but the racing for small boats can be decent.

The club has a nice pool and bar upstairs.<//review>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><text>I just recently rented from ASO. Their employees are extremely professional. One guy in specific who stood out to me was KMART. He helped me with my rentals (the Fischer 94's) and I absolutely loved the skis. If you're looking for a ski with a bit higher of a turning radius give them a try! Also, it's a beautiful little drive through the mountain town to the resort. I can't wait to head up to Mammoth again sometime soon! Much love ASO - I'll be back 🤙🏻</text>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>Missy was the most helpful and experienced store associate I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.

She offered guidance not just for where we should take our bikes but also other fun things to do around mammoth.

She even recommended some awesome off roading trails I took my Jeep on.

Honestly, she was just beyond helpful and will be returning to rent bikes from here just because of her.

Thanks again Missy!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Right across the street from Vons.  Easy to pick up almost anything you need for the slopes, with quality, quick, in-and-out, fair rentals.  They have been my go-to supplier for my family’s ski rentals for years.<//Review>< pictures>

Friendly staff, quick service, definitely recommend. Eeryone was so helpful and they were flexible because it was the off season. Since we didn't know if we wanted to do one day or two, they said keep the rentals and they would just charge us when we brought them in.</text>

We've been renting skis from ASO for years and they always have excellent customer service. This year all 3 of our girls needed skis and boots and they were super friendly and made the experience fun for the kids. We also needed to exchange and return some items we bought and they were very gracious. Thanks ASO!<//review>

We rented ski equipment from Alpine Sports in March 2017 and could not have had a better experience. My wife needed a wider ski boot and Chop went out of his way to get one that fitted, even heating and re-shaping the liner to make it more comfortable. I changed my boots after 1 day with no issues and the staff even helped me carry my gear to the bus stop up the street. Absolutely first class service, really nice people, good gear and a good price! Highly recommended!< /Review>

<Text>My family and I came in early enough to get all 5 of us bikes to rent. They are very knowledgeable here and very helpful. They offered tips and a map to guide us for the day. The prices were extremely reasonable. For half day rental it was $25 and $35 for all day. We got the all day since we weren't sure how long we would be. On top of all the great customer service and attention we received, we got a discount from Yelp that they gave us. And the cherry on top of all that, my eyeglass case got left on the counter and the owner rode down to where I was at a nearby park and delivered them to me. If it was me, I would've waited because we had to come back anyway but he came to me on his bike to deliver them.< /Text><user>110198184004759493947</user><gmapID>0x80960c319d548355:0x886b63702a9d616a</gmapID>< Time>

The 2 guys in the rental areas are rude and look like meth-addict bums.  They don’t act professional, they don’t sound professional.  The mammoth mountain rentals looked at the skis settings when it kept unlocking. They were way off.  The front people and manager are nice.  But I’d stay clear of rentals.  Equipment is from a century ago.<//text>

I took my skis in to get a tune up, and the owner Quoted $70. There were no base welds or edge problems. Just some basic work on the black P-tex base and a wax job. I laughed out load at his quote. I was expecting to pay about $40, which is what I have paid in the recent past for a full tune-up at other shops. If you fly your Lear jet to Mammoth, this is the place to shop. If not, try one of the known and established ski shops in town.<//Text>

My wife and I really enjoyed the fine service we recently received from AOS Mammoth . Greg and his staff went above and beyond to ensure our ski rentals were the correct fit and size. The equipment was top notch and like new. Our four day ski rental from you made our  days on slopes a complete success and really enjoyable. The on line application was easy and expedited the rental process. We will rent again, next time we ski Mammoth. Greg and Lisa Gress, Ashtabula, Ohio ( 4/26/19)< /text>

My girlfriend's skies had issues. Her boots wouldn't lock into the skies. When I took it to the repair shop on the lifts they said the front and rear pads on the boots were worn and that it wasn't safe to ride.  I had to basically get on my knees in the snow and scrape off the snow/ice under her boots and skies every time she had to put them on.  Trust me it wasn't fun. :(</Text>

Poor quality rentals,  the binding wouldn’t snap in, the equipment is very old.  The guys in the
back are obnoxious and don’t know anything about the equipment.

The boots wouldn’t lock into the skis.  When I mentioned it to them they virtually attacked me and just put the skis back into the rest to be used again instead of checking them out.</Review>

Efficient, thorough, and kind folks, and totally reasonable and honest prices. The reviews are true! I was in and out in 10 minutes for a full synthetic oil change, and was charged even less than I was quoted on the phone. Definitely recommend coming here.< /text>

<Text>I’ve been coming here with all my cars since 1994. I have always received quick and courteous service. The price can’t be beat. In or out of warranty, for an oil change, you can avoid the hassle of your dealer by swinging by this gem. You’ll be in and out in 10 mins.<//Text><Time>1538159843355</Time>< Response>

<Text>I have been coming here more than 10 years.   Quickest, most thorough, reasonable service.   Instead of going to the dealer for free oil change, I just stop by here!

No rip off.   For sure, if you have any problem with your car, just stop by.

Supper local business please.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP97K83HC2f2MET1vBXhSwhz8s8tpRkgKgHmi9h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I pull up, exit the vehicle with my dogs in tow. By the time I return from the corner, the oil is changed and serviced.

I'm leaving this review because they made me aware of a slow coolant leak during my last oil change. Long story short, I paid $200 dollars the next day replacing my Heater Core Outlet.

If Anton would not have pointed that out, I would've burned up my truck. Made me feel like this oil change spot has kept me in the game as my truck is my business and I am thankful.<//Text><name>Dave McGoo< /name><date>1588461535153< /date><Gmap_id>0x80c2958885de7153:0xe9a79ced5070ac47<//Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

Tony is the best! I needed a car battery replaced ASAP and he did it faster than I needed, cheaper than I expected, and definitely better than I could have gotten it done somewhere else in the neighborhood. He walked me through the issue and let me know what I needed to do to keep everything running smoothly in the future. These guys could be charging WAY more!! My go-to from now on for anything car-related.< /text>

LADIES EXPECIALLY! !!
This is the place to get your oil changed!!
I was in and out in less than 20 min..... the best part was I watched it all happen, the oil coming out of my car, new filter going in and new oil being poured in... especially when your car takes synthetic oil and it's $75 an oil change!! this way I was sure the oil was changed and I got what I paid for. I left there feeling really good about my decision. .
This is my spot from now on and I'm telling EVERYONE; )<//Review>

If you're looking for honest service, bring your vehicle here and ask for Tony.

Thank you, my friend.</text>

There were three men who helped me at Dave's Quick Lube. I came to have them install my new battery from Carquest across the street since Carquest refused to do it in under an 1 1/2 hours.
I was in and out in less than 10 minutes, which included them testing my battery and my alternator, showing me the wear on my battery terminals recommended to be replaced in the future, and included them putting my spare tire back under my vehicle from a tire shop that had installed it incorrectly earlier that day! They even recommended a tire shop for my future needs.
They were extremely fast and professional, and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend them.</text>

< Review>
This place is my new go to place for oil change and other minor car maintenances. I came here today for the first time for an oil change and they checked and filled all the fluids, as well as tire pressure, and found that the upper radiator hose had a leak. I'm so glad they caught it. It was 40 for the hose and 20 for labor, and they fixed it in less than 15 minutes.< /Review>

I wish I had seen all these reviews before coming here. I feel sorry for the ones that are actually doing their job to their best ability with integrity but to the ones that are not, they are really hurting this medical business. Never have I seen a healthcare workplace so unorganized, rude and aloof; and in many of the different positions.

I want to question the mindset of those people that think they can get away with this terrible customer service and with treating people the way they do. It’s called healthCARE for a reason; they would also not want to go back if the tables were turned.

I’m glad to never have to go back.

Note to overseer/ the ones in charge: (With all due respect) for the sake of your business and for the sake of those you are supposed to be caring for; it’s been time to make some highly necessary changes.< /text>

I was seen at this location by Dr. Desai, OBGYN. I do not recommend. She didn’t listen to what I was trying to explain about my pain & concerns. Turns out now I likely have endometriosis because I saw a doctor who was professional and genuinely listened to me. Dr. Desai did not and I’m not happy with the treatment. If you want a legitimate positive experience with an OB and want to be heard, go somewhere else.</Review>

They ask for all your info, tell you someone will contact you and leave you hanging. You can tell by the people working there they do not care very much about their jobs let alone the health and wellness of others.

Terrible service. Website says open on Saturdays. They ask you to call Saturday when they know they are closed. Their voicemail is full and you cannot leave voicemail. Stay clear of this provider and ask your insurance company to assign you to another place. When you really need help, they won’t be there for you. How do you expect their service to be good when they can’t even be honest about their hours and the way they deal with callbacks?

Go find another provider and save yourself a world of pain and frustration< /review>

<Review>Horrible experience!!!  They totally got the prescription that my son was to be taking incorrect.  If I had not used my common sense he would have ended up back in the hospital  with another seizure.  It also took 3 calls, 2 days, and over 2 hours on the phone on hold for them to correct it.  I was told I could have his blood work drawn if I came in early.  We waited over an hour (even though I was told there was only one person in front of him) when we were told that they didn't draw the kind of test that my son needed, went elsewhere, five days later still waiting for results!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

It seems to me that there is a lack of communication with their staff who is in charge of the scheduling not only at this location, but also the Park location. They are not knowledgeable about basic immunization timespans (IE when it is appropriate for the patient to come back for their next booster shots)
I understand that your clinic sees numerous patients each day, but if your staff did not make these simple mistakes then the clinic would operate more smoothly and there would be less frustration on both ends. Just like the clinic and their staff, the patients have other priorities as well. We take time out of our day to attend these appointments.

This is not the first time that the scheduling staff made a mistake with my appointments. The front desk person at the Park location made a mistake with my appointments twice already.<//text>

My children were seen here for years and I experienced multiple problems until I had enough.

First, they kept terrible records and misrecorded my son's shot records.  They tried to give him incorrect vaccinations until I faught multiple people and showed the stamp card with their own stamps on it.

Second,  multiple providers brushed off a major concern i had for my daughter for years, and one literally laughed at me when I brought it up. Finally I asked for a specialist referral because they are terrible.  The specialist saw her and has recommended surgery for this condition.

Third, they lost my daughter's blood sample for her lead test.

Lots of mismanagement and disorganization. Be prepared to watch everything and be a strong advocate for your care. They are untrustworthy. The front desk ladies are very rude and act like you are ruining their day by being there.

This isn't for the dental office because the dentist at Park Tree is wonderful.<//review>

<Text>Update: I walked in on May 7th. It's July 20th and I still haven't heard back from them after being circled around three times by their staff, made to wait up to "a week" for my result, then two weeks, then "tomorrow". I don't recommend this facility to anyone.

Staff is very disorganized. I've been on the verge of moving for the past two months and can't make the initial move (out of state) because I've been waiting for my results to be given to me. Usually people are notified within the week about their results of any diagnostic testing (in this case, mine was an MRI) and I was never notified via email, US post office, or phone call.
I called it in stating this and was notified that my doctor had quit and they'd get back to me within a few days. I assumed it was because they didn't want to violate HIPPA per doctor/patient confidentiality agreement. I still haven't been notified and it's passed another week.

Am I ever going to find out what my scan said? Because I want to know if i'll ever be able to run again.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>They sent me to the one on park Ave. in Pomona. This place sucks! Short version...No doctor just NP. This was Feb. 20th, I came in limping from a fall, my ankle is either sprained or I have some broken bones in it, bruised as well. My finger is bent and bruised. My knee was bloody as well as my arm. I had cleaned and bandaged my knee and arm. She really didn't do anything! Common sense would be to order me crutches and put a splint or something on my finger after she sent me to get x-rays. Well Centrelake Imaging & Oncology took x-rays of my finger and ankle the same day, still no word on my x-rays. These places are run by monkeys! Not qualified to treat anyone!  Called twice about my x-rays...and nothing! I have an appointment here this morning for blood work, I am going but they will be hearing from me!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Name>Sweet Griz< /Name><Text>This place does suck you make a appointment and they put your appointment to either 2 weeks or practically for like month and when you go to your appointment there not that much ppl waiting but you wait for like almost a hour to be called.. and when you get called you wait in the room for another hour is like why they call your name if your still going to wait another hour.  My insurance just covers that place but I'm gonna have to change from different clinic. This one sucks</Text><time>1525358207850<//time>< UserId.>

Every time you call they put you on hold right away and it's not even for a minute or two it's a good 7-10 minutes (I'm not even exaggerating) Also if you miss your appointment and surpass the 10 minute grace period just forget about coming it's horrible. Also I don't know if it's just me but they seem to never have morning appointments. Point is just don't come to this facility it's not worth your time!!< /text>< pictures>

<text>Waited 4 hours to get a tb test for my son. At the end they told us that he wouldn't be seen til the next day. It's a hit and miss with the staff. You either get a nice person or someone that hates their job. My advice to the staff, if you don't like working with people then quit. My advice to everyone else make an appointment if you don't want to spend all day there.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c33210db146315:0xfd4de4b73283c6cc</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) I think this clinic is even worse than the one in Ontario. I came to Pomona because I didn't like how they treated me there. I find myself in a worse situation. The receptionists don't know how to give information about anything. Call like 5 times to ask if they were ready my results and nobody knew anything they prescribed me a medicine to which my body does not respond because they had already given it to me before I called for the doctor to change it and it is time that she does not give an answer it is assumed that if I went to the clinic it was Something not with having the medication saved I felt better.

I agree with all the people who gave it a star ⭐️ I would give it zero stars 🌟 but it wouldn't let me comment badly inescapable and slow service ....

(Original)
Creo que esta clínica es aun peor que la que está en Ontario vine a qui a Pomona por que no me agradaba como me atendían ahí  me en cuentro  con algo peor las recepcionistas no saben dar información de nada llame como 5 veces para preguntar si estaban listos mis resultados y nadie sabía nada me recetaron un medicamento al cual mi cuerpo no responde por q ya me lo habían dado antes llame para que la doctora me lo cambiara y es hora que no da una respuesta se supone que si fui a la clínica fue por algo no con tener el medicamento guardado me boy a sentir mejor .

Estoy de acuerdo con todas las personas que le dieron una estrella ⭐️ yo le daría cero estrellas 🌟 pero así no me dejaría comentar mal servicio inresposabilidad y lentas ....< /review>< Gmap_id>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is ridiculous that one waits 4 hours without having so many people or the DM Or in the emergency room link, both one and his recessionist is rude and ironic my grandson is a patient of this place I nulka would recommend this time is the second time I come and grab the same and the only thing they say since you waited 4 hours if you want to go to the emergency room this place is not recommended.

Used to be my favorite place before but maybe covid makes the quality go down. tried the love letter again after a while and im super disappointed
Chicken is soggy like soup. Seasoning is not there. I personally think BBQ chicken down the road is much better.
I will never come back.< /review>

They took responsibility for a mistake in our order and promptly corrected it....really appreciated that along with their friendliness.  Food is great when you want saucy garlicky sticky chicken and a mash of different flavors in your pizza.  Sweet potato gold pizza is it! An immediate regular in our takeout rotation!<//Review>

I came here during the soft opening. Expect to wait a little bit for the food considering it's fried chicken and pizza. Prices were fair and the staff was extremely friendly and the manager came by making sure that everything was okay.

We ordered the bulgogi fries and spicy fried chicken. The fries had a really good sauce on top and the spicy chicken was definitely spicy or nothing to overbearing where you couldn't enjoy it. Chicken was extremely moist which made it delicious! I forgot what pizza we ordered but the sauce on top of the pizza was equally good and the crust was very crispy.

Overall, friendly service, expect a weight due to the food that they cook, and great tasting food!<//review>

Amazing fried chicken and pizza. We get the bulgolgi pizza. The fried chicken batter/texture is different than your regular KFC and it's better. There is a long wait for food ~40min so order ahead. Plenty of parking. No areas to eat outside.<//text>

Good service for a big party (FYI automatic gratuity of 18% is added for big groups) and good food. We ordered two sauces, the soy garlic and sweet & mild. Both extra crispy (not sure if it's worth the extra price for extra crispy) and had good flavor. We got a pitcher of beer for a decent prices as well plus they included free corn salad with our order. Make sure you check in for the free drink!< /text>

<Review>I used to go to Love Letter in Rowland Heights, and was very excited to have one open near my house. Unfortunately, its a huge letdown compared to the one elsewhere. The seasoning taste similar (sometimes, bland), but most of the time, the original fried chicken came out soggy and not crispy nor crunchy at all. I was very disappointed the first time but decided to give it a chance many times after, hoping. I hope they can make the fried chicken crispy and juicy like other branches! Pizza is pretty good.</Review>< gmap_id>

The food itself is okay, if you like Korean style chicken and alternate takes on pizza.  The service is downright terrible.

When I went there on a group outing, we ordered separately and to go, due to differing schedules that would force some people to leave at different times.  It still should have been a simple enough affair, since we had over an hour free.

Despite my order being an earlier one, others in my group got their food far before mine.  I waited over an hour, periodically asking about my order and being reassured that my order was coming.  People who ordered after me yet received their food before me had sat down to munch while accompanying me.

Then I was told that they forgot to do my order.  The rest of my group had already finished their food, and it was almost time for the group to head back.  The waitress and manager offered a very anemic apology, seeming to believe a free bottle of cheap soda would suffice for a wait of more than an hour for no good reason.  This is with knowing that it make me waste even more time waiting for food they hadn't even started making.

I demanded a refund.  They went through a big production of having trouble reversing my credit card charges.  I made sure to also keep pestering for a copy of the reversed charges, to ensure I had a record of what happened, and to see the original signed receipt, so that I could cross out my signature and void it.  It took them so long just to understand why I would want to do so.

Through all this, the apologies, both about the food and about the refund, always came with a claimed caveat that it wasn't that person's fault.  No one was willing to take responsibility.

If you like the food at Love Letter, go to a different branch.  The one in Chino Hills will likely leave you disappointed at best, angry at worst.<//Text>

<Time>1554832373120< /Time><review>I'm so glad there's a korean chicken and pizza place in Chino Hills now. We went during the soft opening and was surprised that the entire menu was available.  they do cook your chicken to order so be prepared to wait a while for it to come out.
we got a pizza with a sweet potato - comes with onion, bell pepper, sweet potato, sausage, corn, pineapple, ham, cheese, white sauce.
original whole chicken - half naked and half with the sweet chili sauce.
it's pretty pricey but considering they fry to order, not bad.
definitely will be going back.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>112242614427186468177<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80c3334a2e535a1d:0x5e142dea28a7413e</Gmap_id><name>Audrey Min< /name><resp>None</resp><Rate>5</Rate></record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Came here to order take out. Got the 18 piece chicken wings which took about 30 minutes to make. When I got home and started eating, my wife noticed it seemed short some wings and indeed it was. They ended up giving me 12 wings instead of the 18. Checked the receipt to see if they took the order incorrectly, but they did charge for 18.

I gave them a call and told them what happened and they said they would give me credit for the 6 wings the next time I came in, but the wings were just okay so I asked for a refund. I came back the next couple of days to get my refund and they gave me $8 back which was the menu price difference. I asked them if they were sure that was the correct amount and they said yes. I told them they charged tax on that $8 difference so I should be getting the tax back too and they seems a little annoyed that I was right.

During the ordering, we asked if we could get half one sauce and half another and they said we could, but didn't mention it would be an additional charge for doing that. Just be aware if you want to do that. You'll be charged for two different sauces.

Overall, not impressed with the wings or the service.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Edit: The Love Letter in Rowland Heights is the one I'd recommend. I highly recommend visting the one there and not at this location if you want not only good pizza but also great service and awesome staff.
............
The worst customer service, even from the "MANAGER"..?

Never tried the food because the service was so bad.

I came to order takeout and they told me they would call when it was ready. "Should take 30 minutes" they told me. I waited outside instead cause I didn't really have anywhere else to go.

After 50 minutes, I came back inside to ask when it would be ready. It was ready 30 MINUTES AGO. Their excuse? "We forgot to call. It was busy." It was left out for 30 MINUTES on the front counter. I can't imagine how much longer it would have been left out if I didn't come in.

They apologized and gave me the food. The bottom of the pizza box was near to ripping and it was ice cold.

I went ahead and told them and all they said was "sorry." I asked if they could do something about it but all they replied with was "sorry."

I was visibly upset and all they could say was sorry. I asked if they could remake it and they told me it would take another 30 minutes despite it not being busy anymore. So I asked if I could speak to the manager. He said that he wasn't here and that there was not much to do. So I asked if I can get a refund and he was very hesitant to say anything until he nodded. I asked again if I could speak to the manager and his reply changed? He said that it was him...?

It was like pulling teeth. I won't ever be trying their food.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c3334a2e535a1d:0x5e142dea28a7413e</gmap_id>< user_id>

NEED TRAINING ON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! There is NONE. Not accommodating customers.  Always trying to be in the right. "Not my fault" type of attitude.

The food is as expected. A Korean styled pizza (nothing like what we know pizza ) and mildly salted fried chicken. Again it's all about Korean style.

To be Frank, OVERLY PRICED! Spent approx 45$ on a cheap quality pizza (like one of those 5$ pizza) and a whole chicken fried!

By the way, they charged my bill (which still pending due to discrepancy) without my signature.

The worst of the evening caos, after seeing the manager? Kenny? coming out of the kitchen with FLOUR all over his bare HANDS and trying to resolve their order mistake at the counter,  I am DEFINITELY NOT going back.  Let's hope the white floury powder on his hands is not from the pizza dough he was making in the back. Instead I am praying it is from the gloves... puke.to think..!

I was anticipating so much for its opening in CH yet this being the secind time giving it a try.... FAIL!! I rather spend 45$ at Buffalo place or WingStop.

The service is sloooow and the good does come out slow.  It does take time to fry.

Their marketing of all natural vegetable seasoning...  really? All natural?  Hmmmm...<//Text>

I've been eating at home so many times that I have not been able to eat really well, but I hope I will not have to re-cook the chicken !!!!
I think you do not know if you mix a few things, but I do not feel so good!

<review>Hands down best Taco shop with Great proces. Weve eaten at so many living here and some are just hype some are americanized but the little spot is a hiddent gem. The cheese and their salsa is amaziiing. We had Carne asada fries and the rolled tacos and a Cali burrito. Everything so delicious.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhy-ybq56IicG88041iZyZrhC8wmEqK3iHGuco=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEMGqvZ3QzM5IVb_jHw1HT8_GwkSLPdlKLYb4B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Would be 5 stars but their salsa isn't remotely spicy. It's flavorful tho. Asada fries are quality here!</text>

I really didn't like this food very much. The carnitas don't look like carnitas. They were pretty fatty and gross. Chicken was ok but also fatty.</Review>

< Review>
Did not like my dish. It was a quesadilla with meat, it had guacamole. The guacamole was not fresh. I will go back and try something different. However when I went in, a lot of people came in and we're picking up orders. Maybe it was just what I had. Will give them another chance.< /Review>

<text>Sunday 4/2020 I was there for first time , I ordered my food the cashier was very kind , but the cook I heard him complain about the orders , like if he doesn’t want to make it very sad because we are buying food not asking for free . My first and my last time here sorry but costumers don’t have to heard you complaining about u job if it’s not good enough for you do something else</text>< Pics>

Usually a good spot, but took a friend who ordered a burrito which upset their stomach all night. Imagine ranting about this place to people, only for this to happen. Won’t be eating here for again.< /Review>

<text>This place is decent and just a skip away from the pad. They have all the normal Mexican food. A bonus is the potato tacos and rolled tacos. They also serve menudo which is great when it's cold or you have a cold. It can get busy around dinner times. Best to call in order for pickup.

They've messed up our order a couple of times but are quick to fix when brought to their attention.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Always good food. By far my favorite taco shop to go to. A little small. Always a good idea to call in your order instead of having to wait for your food to be ordered in person. Party platter is always a good buy for a celebration. Best Salsa I've had at any Taco Shop.<//text></record>

My favorite spot in SD for Mexican food. Fast for getting your food and always great! I would just add a few drinks like Sangria, but you can get that at Ralphs.< /Review>

It's alright, the kind of place that will do in a pinch, but you will never dream about. Pastor is chewy and tastes store bought. Prices are high but you do get a good sized taco and sides.</Review>

The meat in the carne asada has been looking and tasting as if it has been reheated from a few days before. The salsa has had a rancid taste, as if it is in the verge of spoiling.</Text>

We have visited this restaurant for over 20 years, we love their carne asada burrito, rolled tacos and carne asada fries, they're absolutely delicious. Consistent flavor and fast service keeps us coming back for more. I highly recommend it.<//review>

<Text>Food is good, just the place is a hole in yhe wall joint. Prices are as if you were going to a nicer place. Lolitas prices are comparable, yet lolitas restaurant image and locations are much nicer. Need to remodel update the place so you can justify the high prices. 90 cent refills seriously.< /Text>< UserId.>

They always make good food, they don't have a driv-thru but they are great when you phone in your order for pick-up.  Their prices are always reasonable, usually lower then the other taco shops.  This is a mom & pop shop & I like the people. I support small businesses. Give them a try.< /review>

Little biased on this one since it has been my main taco shop growing up. Hidden in Paradise Hills, this is little staple has stood the test of time. The decor from when I was in middle still holds strong nearly 15 years later. Even the Shakira cut out behind the register remains unmoved, her powerful eyes looking over the store. Outside of its nostalgia, is a basic taco shop with all the traditional fares. To be honest, their fries are soggy, tortilla too stale, and sauces are bland. However, decently seasoned meat, solid portions, and $7.95 carne asada fries make it my taco shop. It may not be special for anyone else trying it out, but if I'm in the area and am craving it, Ill swing by every time.<//Text>

I think this place is uber good the one problem I have is that they need to make there French fries crispy. When You order carne asada fries you can tell the oil is not hot enough because the French fries are soggy there carne asada fries would be bomb is the were crispy.</Review>

The decor inside was really cool. The music was loud (maybe it was so that when it was really busy it would be backround music. But it was just us 2 and we couldn't hear each other speak.

They do take your card before you order and hold it the entire time.

I couldn't decide what to get so I eventually just decided on chicken tenders, so I wasn't expecting much. But the waitress said "ooh, good choice!" So that got my hopes up. They turned out to be the worst chicken tenders from a Mexican restaurant that I've ever had. So dry and pretty sure they were burned.

My husband's brunch meal looked good and was super big though.

If I ever come back, I'll go to the other restaurant by the beach.</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>I went here for dinner I found out it was just too much going on it was nice that they had the outside dining area but you had to take a picture of yourself before you go in and show your ID which was just a little bit too much then when we got there is a Mexican restaurants normally when you go to Mexican restaurants you get free chips and dip and salsa but they want to charge you for every little thing and the chips were stale and I think I paid like $5 for it and I'll just thought that was just a little bit too much for still chips and salsa then they ordered the chicken for I ordered the fajita plate and the fluffy is were good not a lot barely enough for one person they said they had guacamole cheese and sour cream on the side which is like a teaspoon and I asked them that they have guacamole with the meal they told me no but then I so I ordered more guacamole 10 bucks and I was like that's just too much when I got it they had guacamole on the plate yes a teaspoon but it was still guacamole on the plate and then it was just so much stress I didn't enjoy the dining experience at all and end up spending $80 on a meal that should have cost me $10 but I paid and I will never go back there again and thank you for the not good service< /Text>< Pics>

Security guy at the gate of outdoor dining threatened to pop me in the mouth for not having a mask when I went to grab my bag at my table 2 feet away that had my mask. Unprofessional and completely inappropriate.< /Text>

< review>
I had the WORSE experience here on 5/5/2021. Our initial waiter was amazing, but it was time for him to clock out and and a new waitress “Heather” was supposed to take over our table. We already ordered our first drink and appetizer, however we were ready to order our actual meal. We waited for 30 mins (we watched her go to every table but ours). Eventually I got tired of waiting and went looking for the manger. I spoke to the manger “Guy” he was VERY nonchalant and had no urgency to help. About five minutes later Heather finally made her way to our table rolled her eyes and said are “you ready to order.”  We kindly said yes and mentioned we’ve been waiting for quite some time. She looked over and said give me a second THEN WALKED AWAY. Five more minutes pass and she finally takes our order by that time we were frustrated ordered a beer and asked to cash out. I’m extremely taken back by the carelessness of both the manger and our waitress. We were the only black people in that section within the hour of us waiting we watched other customers get seated , fed and taken care of without even a look our way. I’ve been to Cabo plenty of times and never have I felt so unseen and disrespected by the staff. I am disgusted!</review>

<text>We came here for a birthday celebration. The food was pretty good. They have a 2 for 1 special during happy hour which was nice. The drinks on the rocks are better than the blended drinks. Overall we had a good experience and I would visit here again.< /text>< pictures>

Really cool and chill place. The Host Jason is really Funny and should be on the entertainment business, from the minute you walk in he engages you and makes you feel welcome and appreciated. And Stephanie our waitress was amazing. It's a must if you come down to Venice Beach.< /text>

It was great went on a Sunday it was crowed as heck. But the lines were moving pretty fast and the food came out fast...Nice customer service.  The only thing that I questioned was why did they need to hold my credit card.</review>

Horrible experience! First of all update your hours went to Cabo thinking they closed at 2am turns out they close at midnight. our tabs already cause they close in 5 mins.  I arrived at Cabo around 11:15 pm received my drinks around 11:30/11:35 pm. Our waitress closed our tab 6 mins before 12am okay cool. Then a security guard comes up to my friends and I a min later asking if we closed our tab cause they close at midnight. None the less my drink was still full exactly at 12 they started kicking everyone out! I can’t even sit down and enjoy something I paid for? Highly doubt I’ll be coming back it used to be my favorite bar to kick back.< /text>

<review>Management needs to take some customer service lessons ASAP. They do not even try to actively listen to customer concerns to come to at least a happy medium in an effort to keep customers happy and coming back.< /review>< pics>

<Text>This place has good food and drinks but be aware at checkout! Me and my friends were celebrating a birthday and decided to to come to this place and get drinks. We ordered a variety of things so we were a little drunk. We stayed til closing and by the time they had closed out tab. They had charged us multiple Wine bottles, we tried to complain but they just treated us like a bunch of drunks and told us they had already closed... We ended up being charged nearly 40% tip and include 2 wine bottles we never got and food items we never ordered.... They obviously scammed us.

Nice place to visit. Close to Venice beach, you can smell the ocean from there)
Food is OK, many options for drinks.
Toilet is unisex, I still can't get used to it though...

CT, the new guard performed very well and deserves to be hired on as well as a pay raise. AJ  handled a situation with uncooperative customers to the best of his abilities. Both Christopher and AJ handled the Situation as professional as possible and deserve a raise and respect to the max of whoever's authority<//Text>

<Text>First time at this location and it was great!! The warm weather definitely was appreciated considering how windy and cool it was outside. We went for happy hour (which is only two for one drinks). There are no food specials which kind of sucks because most other places do offer happy hour food specials. The drinks were good and service was great. It’s a nice spot and the people that come there are friendly as well. I would recommend this place.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBe21HOyEyq716JzdeI9gaNynwnhWhb1X8GIXQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI26Mb09M1GKCqr8EAB_y9bmNdFDy8W_92oOEg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORKBljqlgIzNqNgWNY0ihK_7l4m8D0Kedn3Lop=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><GmapID>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c< /GmapID>< resp>

the ultimate ice cream experience.

I rarely go for ice cream since it's on the less healthy side of food or desert choices. I regard it as a slow heart attack item.

Nevertheless, gotta go sometime.

Meaning, when in particular company, icecream is a nice added feature presenting cool social benefits.

I mean you can't not share a sample with your date or companion.

Anyway, the cold stone gimmick of mashing and mixing the icecream on the cold stone slab adds to the entertainment of the moment.

And the waffle layout in a dish makes for a total yum experience.

Even if it adds to clogging of arteries and a quicker route to six feet under.</text>

Everything was great except the restroom really stinks. Both women and men have to share and its smells horrible. Not a place one wants to enter and smell before or after you eat. Other then that excellent, relaxing and great place to eat.< /Review>

Yesterday 8/6/19 around noon my friend and I decided to come in and have lunch. My friend is Vegan so we asked the waitress (who I won’t name) if there were any Vegan options, she said that there was none exactly but they could work something up so she suggested grilled veggies taco. We asked questions regarding cross contamination because that is an actual thing. People who are Vegan cannot consume contaminated food because it makes them ill. (Same if a person was allergic) We even asked about the French fries and she was honest about it being fried with oil that has been used for other food but said the veggies are grilled with new oil and on their own so it should be okay and we went with her suggestion(Veggie grilled Tacos). Long story short my friend became ill developed a fever and stomach problems she got very sick after consuming these tacos. I’m just very disappointed and upset because this is down right disrespectful. You need to be aware that there are people who have restrictions to eat certain foods. There are people who like my friend are Vegan and there are people who could have allergies or do to religious beliefs cannot eat certain foods. This is not a joke! If you cannot provide what we or any other person needs, have some integrity!< /text>

The music was very tasteful. The service was good. The atmosphere was awesome. The margaritas were bland. The shrimp tacos & that sauce they place on the side was bomb. Nachos were okay.<//Review>

My friends and I went for Happy Hour and split the bill at the end. Service was slow, but the people were nice. One of our group members closed out and paid for his tab. When we paid our bill, the bill wasn't itemized and we assumed all was good. The waitress gave us her card and said she was a comedian and said we should check her out. Fine. The next day, when we looked into what we paid to split the bill, it was more expensive than we thought so we called, they said not only did they not subtract our friends bill but also added nachos that we didn't order. We asked to be sent the bill via email along with what our friend paid, which they did. We replied we didn't order or consume the extra charges, but they refused to reimburse us for the extra $20+ charges because we had signed the unitemized receipt from the night before. What crooks. If you go there, fine, but make sure they don't steal your money.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP9egOYws3jVV8kvpmtyHm5F2Lx00JJcqpEdXy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I gave one start because we were there for about 30 mins and although we spoke with the server, we never got severed. We even asked to another server, who although busy told us she'd get us someone to assist us. No one eventually showed up for more than 15 so we decided to leave. This is really poor service quality.< /text>

<Text>My cousin and I originally went for their Taco Tuesday. I mean all you can eat tacos for $7. Why not? We got there at about 8:50 pm waited at the bar to be served and no one paid attention to us until 9:16 pm. When we asked for the taco Tuesday special we were told it ended at 9. We were a little upset by that. But none the less we were hungry so the couple next to us ordered the nachos ( it looked scrumptious) . So we had an order of nachos with steak and their peach margarita with 4 shots to share for $19. The nachos were amazing. The steak juice and seasoned perfectly. Our bartender was hilarious. All in all a great night. I will be back!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

Amazing place for huge margaritas and good music. I went with a few friends on the weekend and had a blast. They even have outdoor fireplaces on the roof so when it gets cold on the beach you can still drink outside. I suggest taking advantage of the taco and burrito specials because that’s what they’re good at. Also ordering one monster margarita should last you the whole meal.< /text>

<text>After a long Saturday on Venice Beach Boardwalk, we decided to take a short 12 min walk to Cabo Cantina for dinner. The walk was stunning! Glass houses to the left,  the sun setting on the beach to the right. Security checked our ID and we were on our own to find seating. All 3 levels were packed to capacity, which were a little discouraging, but we were able to squeeze two stool seats to the fire pit bar for a very beautiful scenic dinner setting. I had to go grab food menus from the back bar, and we waited about 10 mins before a waitress found us to take our order. The music was blaring some of our favorite 90’a jams, so the wait didn’t seem long. The wings that I once ordered at the Hollywood location weren’t on the menu, so I ordered the  chicken sunset rolls with a side of fries and Ari ordered the queso dip (with added shrimp). We shared a raspberry margarita. The sunset rolls melted in my mouth, um um good. The fries were fresh and hot thick wedged. Ari’s queso dip looked like mush and she said it turned her stomach. The margarita was “ok” in taste to me, but Ari said it tasted like medicine. I liked the loud environment, Ari said she didn’t like the people dancing so close to where we ate. 3.5 stars because booth parties should love the venue for 5 stars. I rounded up to 4 stars because I personally liked this place a lot to finish a fun Beach day.<//text><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

We are two adults in our 50’s and they wouldn’t take our order without prepaying or holding our cc! Place is a gong show supervisor with long dark hair glasses and Mex tattoo was rude forcefully trying to upsell drinks that had no prices on the menu?? She was arguing with younger staff like out of bar rescue episode. Whole staff vibe felt angry and food was terrible. When we asked for our cc back they would not release it until we payed in cash. Can u say trust issues!!<//review>

100 Percent the ABSOLUTE WORST service I/we have ever had. And this is coming from two server's that understand what it's like to be weeded/behind. We were not greated and had to flag down three different waiters each time we wanted to Order, order another round, ask for our check. And then eventually physically get up, track down our alleged waitress, only to discover she didn't have our check. Then find the other "Waiter" that did. She gave us our check, without a pen to sign with. The ONLY time I've ever not tipped someone in my life.
I guess I know the reason they take your card before you order anything. Safe to say a walk out or two, or three, or four , or five, or a MILLION have happened before in the past.</Text>

To start with 2 for 1 margaritas it's a great way to get the evening going. But it's not just the Margaritas that are two for one. It's any of the drinks. The bartender was efficient and friendly. I Never Had An Empty Glass. I had the Baja bowl and it was very good. I had their hot salsa. It was not as hot as I prefer but it was tasty.<//review>

It's a cool place. I would say it's geared more towards college students or someone in their 20's. It's become a bit unsettling with pigeons flying around your head and walking around upstairs. I use to love sitting upstairs near the fire pit with my friends. Not so much any more. The food use to be really good.<//review>

You barely get your money's worth with this food. I ordered shrimp tacos and all I got was 2 soft shells with a few pieces of shrimp a sprinkle of cabbage (which was supposedly coleslaw) and a little cup of sauce which just tasted like sriracha sauce and mayo. I suppose this place is only good for drinks not actual food.<//Review>

Was an okay experience at first until the end of the night when I tried to close my tab and the bartender continuously told me she gave my card back but didn’t. Proceeded to tell me she’d call and let me know about my card and never heard anything. Maybe if the bartenders weren’t drinking behind the bar this wouldn’t of been a problem.<//text>

<Review>Check your bill carefully!!! They brag about their 1/2 off Happy Hour and then stiff you @ full price. They tried saying that $13.50 per margarita is the Happy Hour price lol. On what planet would a margarita cost $27.00! GET YOUR ETHICS IN CHECK! They did finally reduce my bill by 1/2< /Review>< name>

The food is good and mega margaritas are the main attractions.  Its small so it can get busy fast but it is worth the wait.  You have to pay for parking on the main street if you can find it.< /Text>

Their margaritas are HUUUUGE. One plate and appetizer is enough for 2 people. If you're drinking a margarita there I suggest just sharing a plate. I always leave super full🤣. But the vibe in there is fun!</Review>

<text>Probably the best Cabo location. If you can snag a table on the deck upstairs, you get a really nice view of the beach. The last time I went was Sunday of Labor Day weekend. It wasn't overcrowded, so it was enjoyable. Prior to that, I had always gone at varying times on Saturday. In my Saturday experience, it is always too crowded, and I'm left standing in the way until my friends and I can swoop in on a table. The margaritas aren't bad, but coming from a margarita connoisseur, they are nothing to write home about. They do have a variety of fun flavors, though. And if size is your thing, this is your place.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>111032370716963810678<//userid>< gmapID>

Decent cantina. Friendly wait staff. Expected decor. Steak burrito was nicely put together and well flavored but unevenly heated. Outside and rooftop seating options. Next stop, Venice Beach.<//review>

PLEASE! Read your RECEIPT!!

This is coming from a customer who has been to this and MANY Cabo Cantina's and I believe they are trained to skim (not scam) the customers.

They literally take your order with a smile, then serve you whatever drink they want. OR They serve you what you order and add El DORADO to the bill. El Dorado is the premium drink that is $12.95 or $13.95 depending on how they decide to bill it (or their fancy keying or renaming it to another, cheaper drink). I ALWAYS order the TJ classic which is $7.95 and the most basic Jose Cuervo Margarita.

They will charge for the El Dorado (Patron tequila) margarita and say they made a mistake if you challenge it. Then, instead of changing that, they offer to remove a food item (for alcohol billing and for skimming purposes) instead of adjusting the real price of the drinks you ORDERED.  They will say the price difference (b/c its not listed on the menu) is only $1 or $2 but as you can see, its $5 or $6!

In the End, ALWAYS check your receipt.  Do NOT pay for drinks misattributed to your bill. And, do NOT let them take advantage of you, because as long as I have been going there, THEY WILL ALWAYS TRY!.

I have been going there for over 11 years, and Everytime, EVERY location, they try the same skim (scam) and everytime I catch them, call them out, and get my bill adjusted!

Do the SAME!<//Text>

Even after the waiter has said it applied to all spirits and beers. We did not tip due to this. I was walking into the toulet and was confronted by waiter saying we did not tip he and tips were not included in the cheque. I said i know this and explained why. She then went and told every staff memeber and customer she could find that we were dirty and did not tip. Might i add after having to ask for the cheque she said if we did not write a tip they would automaticaly add 18%.we wrote $0.00<//Text><name>Hayden Bird< /name>< resp>

They let my huge dogo in when it was really cold while we were waiting on a order to go. Even gave me a bowl for water. Love the upstairs balcony thing with the fire place and heaters! I'll come back even tho I feel that quality of the food dosnt match the prices. It's just a great place to hang for a min and grab a drink.</Review>

<review>The security guard was so nice to us. The place was good. The pineapple taste nasty. I wasn't going to say anything about it. However, I have a feeling that I should share the waitress about the nastiness of the drink. It tasted stale. I will go again. Hopefully I won't have to drink some bad to the taste.< /review>< Pics>

If you are looking for a place to drink next to the beach with less than ridiculous pricing, than this is a decent option. Well, pretty good considering it's one of only a few options.

Their margaritas are insanely sweet, even the classic. Also, please note that pricing on drinks can be a bit deceptive, especially during happy hour.

Food on the other hand is surprisingly good. Flavorful and in pretty generous portions, this is definitely not a good place for a diet but great with a beer or two.

Service is pretty unresponsive, so it isn't a great place if you're in a rush. But if you're afternoon or evening is relaxed, it's not a bad place to spend some time.</Review>

Decent place at the beach. They only had Modelos in a can :(   I probably would've had more fun if I went with different company. I got there a bit late so I was just down for drinks but my date was more interested in stuffing his belly with tons of food. Mixed crowd, not too difficult to park, overall, decent.</Review>

<Review>this is my 2nd time going and I enjoyed myself BUT, my group and i felt as if the wait for our endless tacos was kind of long but the waitresses made that up to us and kept it coming. I love this location and love the vibe. the music NEEDS to get updated quickly. we were ready to dance and only about 5-8 songs were cool... we were there for about 3 1/2 hours soo the music should at least get some updated songs in there. but will come back. food is amazing!< /Review>< user_id>

Extremely racist! We came in with a group of college educated, professional people after a HBCU event and the manager immediately got concerned. He walked over to us as we were walking in and said, "we don't want any loud noise in here." "What?", I thought in my head. What insinuated that we were going to be loud? Outside of you judging the color of our skin. After all we are at a bar not a quiet, fancy restaurant. It was filled with white people talking loud, singing and having a good time. Yet as soon as we walked in we were asked or told not to be loud. We hadn't even taken our seats yet. As the time went on we were met with extremely poor service. The waitress took 15-20 mins before she ever arrived to our table, got our orders incorrect and demanded that we pay first. It's our policy she exclaimed. Not true by they way. Our food never came out and the manager kept walking by watching everything we were doing. One my friends heard something funny and busted out laughing and slapped the table in a big chuckle. The manager approached us and said we can't make noise or slap the table and asked us to leave. We willing complied because we were done with the rude treatment and politely asked for our credit cards back and a refund on the food we never received because we were still waiting on it to arrive. The manager said to an employee "they just don't want to pay for their food." How is that so when we paid in advance for the food? The food was never delivered to us (purposely). Seeing as though when we asking for a refund all of a sudden our food was being carried over to the table that we were asked to leave from. Because we are all very well paid, college graduated professionals we decided to leave the mistreatment, without a refund or the food. The whole situation was a display of their mistreatment and hatred for Black people. They displayed their racism and we did not let them provoke us. Attempt failed! We are too blessed to engage in racist mess. However, I  strongly hope that something is done so that this won't happen again. They should be shut down! It's 2019 people. Racism will not prevail.</Text>

This restaurant blatantly discriminated against me!!! I was wearing a hat that night and the security guard who was checking IDs pointed to a No Hat sign and told me I have to take the hat off before entering and put it back in my car. (I couldn't put it in my bag because the guard said some people sneak and put it back on once they're inside.) I felt like this was a bit extreme but I went all the way to my car and put it away. Once I got back in line the same security guard was checking the ID of a man with a baseball cap on (exactly like mine!) and then he let the man in!!! So I was next in line and I expected the guard to give me some type of an explanation. He didn't. So I asked, "I thought we weren't able to wear baseball caps?" and the guard says "Oh...umm, yeah....So the manager has this thing where he lets certain people that he knows in with hats on..." I didn't stay to hear the rest of his obvious lie. I walked in and told my friends what happened and we all left and went to the Cabo Cantina in Santa Monica, and I must add that I was able to freely wear my baseball cap along with the 20 other people who felt like wearing a hat that night!

*Do not go to the Cabo Cantina in Marina Del Rey! Go to the one in Santa Monica, we had a great time :)< /text>

This is definitely a fun atmosphere by the beach hanging out with friends for Mega margaritas, beers, nachos and a variety of food that may not be on your diet.  Of course they have Taco Tuesday all you can eat tacos for $6 something and happy hour 2 for 1 from 4pm-8pm.  Great spot to watch sports.  There is a parking lot at the end of the street, but it obviously fills up quickly as do most beach parking lots, street parking is there but tough to find.<//review>

Get in, get messy and get it on. This is a great place for sloshing back cheap beers and tacos and eye balling the scantily-clad showgirls or muscled-up machos that have been strutting up and down the Venice Beach boardwalk all day. Cheap and cheerful is theme of the food, drink and stand-out patrons, and its a great place to start or end your night.</Text>

<Review>I Would have rated lower if possible, sure this place is grate if you're know or perceived as a spender but otherwise don't bother, the service here will leave a taste in your mouth worst than the shocking, cheap tasting, pre-made cocktails. Biggest regret is being lured in by the b1g1f offer as they will do everything they can to forget there own offer and attempt to rip you off. If you're bold enough to question this even within there own printed terms you will be in for a show especially if you have the young lady who served me, after this display we paid and left swiftly to be chased on to the street where we were the educated in the American tip system and told that if we expect better service next time we should really consider tipping, well young lady this is where I wish to re-educate you.

Good service = tip

Not the other way round.

Up side this was the only bad experience I had saying near by, I recommend the Venus waler down the road,,, much nicer and they will deserve the tip<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Yesterday was my first time ever going to Cabo Cantina in Venice and out of a 1-10 scales 1 being unacceptable 10 being great it was a solid 3. That’s me just being generous. The overall establishment was filthy. Dust completely covered EVERYTHING. The signs, the televisions, the decorations that hung from the ceiling, completely covered with thick dust. I stayed despite the constant thoughts that a dust bunny may of fallen on me. Our waiter “Mico” had given us attitude right from the start. It was obvious her day had been messed up prior and we just got all of the aftermath. While taking our order she was not attentive at all. Since I was a first timer I had questions and she seemed very irritated when answering. Since it was happy hour the drinks were 2 for 1 (margaritas) and you could make it a double. Well after completely explaining to me what a double was when our drinks came to the table they were not made in a double but in two singles. And they were all made tasting more like flavored lemonades then actual margaritas. When we brought it to her attention she advised us that she put in the order one way BUT the bartender just did their own thing, then she said in a smart way, I can just pour the two drinks in one cup if you want. That’s defeats the purpose of it being a double Mico. It was supposed to be three doubles; 1 Peach, & 2 Strawberry Mangos total of 3 drinks. Instead we got 6 diluted drinks. We wanted 2 shots in on drink more potent, but no. Anyways when we ordered food, I asked for a steak and chicken nachos, jalapeños and sour cream on the side. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla. When my order arrived not only was it covered in sour cream, but there was also a sour cream on the side as a side? As for my friend her quesadilla came, halfway cooked & without chicken. That’s when I wanted to speak to a manager. The manager was definitely a character himself, I wish I would have gotten his name. He went checked to see what we ordered and compared it to what we received, too many errors at one table. He said it was miscommunication, & that the staff may not of been giving our waiter enough support.. how is that our issue? He was sarcastic but it was obvious he didn’t want to be bothered with us either. He said and I quote “it’s not us (as in me and my friends) it’s just everybody wants a lime or something & I’m fat, out of shape & I don’t like stairs (because we were upstairs) & I don’t like any of these mother f**k***” like WOW. You’re the owner of an establishment, do you talk to everyone like this? If you talk about your staff like this.. I wonder what you say about paying customers!! We were all pretty appalled. He did eventually get things some What situated. After our in counter our waitress went great lengths to avoid us, we again had to find a manger just to get our bill so we could pay and leave. What a nightmare. My coworkers love this spot they even agreed this was their first time at this location and it was horrible. I don’t care if there are other locations, my time and hard earned cash won’t be spent there ever again.<//Text></record>

I would not have given them 1 star if it would have given​ the option to leave a review. The service and food sucks here. The staff is completely incompetent and rude at best. The manager lied to us saying that after a two hr wait and no food so the all you can eat tacos were no longer available. He would adjust a few items like drinks. Do Not Go Here!!!< /text>

<review>This establishment is extremely unprofessional. I recently visited Cabo cantina and had a horrific experience! I was convinced by the server to order the large margarita. I ordered the margarita which was very thick and syrupy very unenjoyable. I asked the server if I could send it back and order something else and she told me she would have to get her manager. The manager Cody came out and with a very disrespectful tone and aggressive demeanor told me I will have to drink the margarita because  "it didn't appeared to be defective". I told him i simply didn't want it it was not enjoyable. He said it doesn't matter I have to pay for it. I should have known this place was shady when I looked at the menu and there were no prices. I had also ordered tacos which at that point i didn't want because I was so displeased with the service I was being given. His aggressive and forceful approach made me and my co worker want to leave. So I told him immediately to cancel my tacos before they came out. He said no I won't cancel anything you will be paying for those as well. All the while he was clearly on drugs sniffing and super amped and aggressive. I am a server at a nearby restaurant and was there for a co workers birthday and ended up leaving in tears. I have never in my life seen this type of behavior in any restaurant. I was forced to pay 35$ after not having had a single bite and only one sip of their disgusting margarita. He should be fired for his behavior or forced to lay off the drugs when working. Please do yourself a favor this place is all around horrible do go there.< /review>< pics>

<text>A sexist/feminist security guard by the name of Javier did not allow me to enter cabo cantina because I had a brown bandana around my head. Meanwhile a female walked out and back in with a black bandana around her head. I asked him whats up with that and he replied "she's a girl". So I told him "thats like me saying you're not a man cause u have a long ponytail on ya head bro". His manager was going to let me in but said my comment was argumentive. But by that time i didn't want any of their business anyways. I was just there to watch Moval Legend Kawhi get that ring for Toronto do you dig!!!</text></record></dataset><record>

Perfect place to go when the night is getting old and you’re on low funds. Their margaritas are good  but also have the sweetest 2 for 1 deal. Happy hour starts @ 22:00</Text>

Basically, if you're going for anything other than a margarita, you'll be disappointed. Wait staff actually talked down about other menu items and offerings. We even overheard them doing the same at other tables near ours not just to our group</Text>

<Text>Cabo cantina is great if you’re really hungry and want to share a big plate of nachos or nacho fries. Their margaritas are really big but a little pricey. They usually have good music and music videos plus the game to watch! I go here with my friends a lot and sometimes even make new friends here 🙂</Text>< user>

Went to this place on Monday. The wait staff was very friendly, the food was great. However, the drink prices were very high... Which we could have gotten over if it was disclosed in advance. $18.50 for a margarita was a bit unexpected and a slap in the face. Happy hour specials advertised all over the bar, buy one get one free happy hour on menu, it was happy hour time on a monday... full price, or double price was charged as the happy did not apply that day at owners discretion... SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED IN ADVANCE OR at least verbally mentioned upon order.<//text>

< Review>
Great happy hour just very small and tight bar. Not recommended for large groups. Much better for 1-4 adults. No parking lot. You have to park at the beach or fight for metered street parking. Has a rooftop patio which is nice if you don't get seated directly in the sun. Lots of tvs for watching sports. Food is ok moderately priced< /Review>

No hats on Tuesdays only. Even if it was in my wife's purse. As the bouncer is wearing a hat...The bouncer and manager called me a gang member. Classy.</Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>If I could give no stars I would. I have never had service this horrible. I opened a tab with the bartender, Paige, during happy hour but apparently when i went to close my tab, my card had magically disappeared, and Paige had ended her shift. A server told me to go down stairs and check if they had my card, even though I NEVER went down stairs but I  checked anyways.

Of course they did not have my card, then the manager came to talk to me to inform me that my tab was closed and was signed for, which was a shock for me. I asked to see the signed bill and the signature was obviously a different name and all the manager said was "I can't do anything, call your card company and cancel your card". The manager never took responsibility for the mistake nor apologized. Now I have to dispute the charges and get a new a card while the manager there has no care.<//Review>< Rating>

<text>Ok I've gotten nachos at a lot of places. But these guys, BY FAR, give you the most nachos for the price I've EVER SEEN. I split one order with my friend all the time and I feel sick AF after almost always because we eat to much. Litterilly you need 3-4 people per order. It's great.

I will NEVER go back there. & they tried to say a guy i was with was racist because he stated "i don't want that white shot" indicating he wanted a dark shot instead of a clear one.

This is the worst restaurant experience that I have ever had. The food took forever, and was served cold,so I asked to speak to the manager. He answered my complaint using a deflective strategy, stating "Everyone else seems to be OK." I retorted that his comment was irrelevant to the poor service I received, along with the tough meat and cold food.This manager was rude,condescending, and indifferent, and responded with a terrible tone and demeanor.The waitress was not trained properly,and didn't even bother to take my food order,but instead just kept walking by even though I had initially asked for a menu.Even when she brought my beverage, she just walked away. I called to her,and she didn't even bother to respond. Terrible experience, rude manager who rather than addressing the issues at hand, chose to be a rude JERK!!!</Text>

<review>Ok I've gotten nachos at a lot of places. But these guys, BY FAR, give you the most nachos for the price I've EVER SEEN. I split one order with my friend all the time and I feel sick AF after almost always because we eat to much. Litterilly you need 3-4 people per order. It's great.

Place was absolutely disgusting, they take forever to order your food, margaritas aren’t even considered happy hour cause they are extremely expensive, 2 girls walk out the restroom and when I enter restroom there’s vomit all over the place, bartenders drunk behind the bar, waiter extremely rude literally telling us that the drinks were going to be like water and she replies with “I told you “ , this place isn’t family oriented don’t bring your kids, place is a disgrace don’t go here!</Review>

<Text>Came here with a group of colleagues on a Wednesday night. The place was empty and the bartender was mediocre: enormous margaritas with mostly sweet syrup and little booze. Also we arrived about ten minutes before the "2-for-1" offer began but the bartender didn't budge on giving us the offer before time despite us bringing the place to life from a standstill start. I'm unlikely to return.</Text><time>1414950901399</time><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>2< /Rate><gmapID>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c< /gmapID>< UserId.>

This is the worst restaurant experience that I have ever had. The food took forever, and was served cold,so I asked to speak to the manager. He answered my complaint using a deflective strategy, stating "Everyone else seems to be OK." I retorted that his comment was irrelevant to the poor service I received, along with the tough meat and cold food.This manager was rude,condescending, and indifferent, and responded with a terrible tone and demeanor.The waitress was not trained properly,and didn't even bother to take my food order,but instead just kept walking by even though I had initially asked for a menu.Even when she brought my beverage, she just walked away. I called to her,and she didn't even bother to respond. Terrible experience, rude manager who rather than addressing the issues at hand, chose to be a rude JERK!!!</review>

<review>Poor customer service. Rude waitress. Can't think of her name but she has long black hair. & she's rude as hell. I will NEVER go back there. & they tried to say a guy i was with was racist because he stated "i don't want that white shot" indicating he wanted a dark shot instead of a clear one. I guess that's considered racism? Manager and staff were unprofessional!!! Don't go here!</review>< rating>

They don't honor the unlimited mimosas / bloody marys on "holiday weekends" even though the place was pretty empty. They also cut the unlimited hours on football sundays down, but don't post it.

The food was decent before they re-worked the menu. Now it's not worth the money.

And as a final kicker, my credit card info was stolen last time I left it for them to hold for the tab.

In search for a new brunch / football hangout place. Not going back.<//Review>

Didn’t have a good experience. Went to celebrate my brothers birthday and had a very agitated waitress by the name of Jadeon. She lacked patience and constantly got some of our orders wrong. Once we let her know the orders were a bit malfunctioned she had a very nasty attitude towards my sister. I already noticed she was agitated which is why i proceeded to say that you everytime she came to our table. She yelled at my sister and my sister yelled back, refused to serve us, and didn’t advise another waitress to assist us. Maybe Jadeon needs another job or needs to practice better customer service skills. Also the chicken tacos i ordered were very dry. I as well as my family did not appreciate her behavior not one bit. In continuance, there was no manager we could talk to regarding Jadeon’s behavior. We asked to see a manager and didn’t get another server nor manager. Jadeon needs an attitude check, luckily we were being patient with her because it could’ve went very bad for her.< /text>

Didn't try a Margo. They're all made with Jose Cuervo especial, which is alright, but I wouldn't drink too many. Tequila doesn't make you sick, Cuervo does. 2 for 1 drinks is a great deal in this hood. Chips and salsa were awesome.< /Review>

Terrible!  I have never experienced such rude, ridiculous and unprofessional behavior.  The manager/bartender Ray demanded the removal of the guy I was with because of a dispute over the quality of the drink he was given.  Really? If you're that sensitive about your drink making ability perhaps you should either improve your skills or just do something else.  As if that weren't enough of an insult he tried to add an intimidation factor (although no one was afraid of him) by standing over the guy as he was seated and being increasingly disrespectful until he (Ray) was asked to walk away.  Thankfully my friend was level headed and there was ONE staff member qualified to handle conflict as to not allow the situation to escalate.  There obviously needs to be more training for employees here.  I'm reluctant to add the race factor to the scenario, but if anyone else has had a similar experience please let someone know these things are going on here I can't see how it is being tolerated by ownership.  Very upsetting< /Text>

Food was horrible. The beans were canned the rice tasted like it came out of a bag. The fish tacos were decent. All in all I had a bad experience.<//text>

Has kind of a college hang out/sports bar vibe, but it's by the beach, has great drink specials and the food portions are large. The carne asada fries are amazing.< /review>

Worst customer experience ever! They brought everyones order out that i was with except for mine, waited 10 mins & no food so asked where it was they came back & said the order never got put in. By the time i got my food everyone else was done. Then took forever just to figure out how to ring us up. And still charged me for the wrong order. I will never ever go back to this place. The waitresses clearly have no clue what there doing!!!!!< /review>

For several years now I've been coming to this Cabo Cantina every so often. Mostly to watch sports and have some of their giant margaritas. I finally went to their Taco Tuesday and I was very impressed!

I've never liked their food much (I'm Mexican, I know what authentic Mexican food should taste like), but the margaritas are great along with other drinks. The decor and atmosphere is very fun and young. They have an upstairs and downstairs area, both with outside patios. Located right off the Venice Beach Boardwalk, it is the perfect location for "drinks on the beach" (you can't literally drink on the beach, unfortunately, but you catch my flow).

Taco Tuesday was great! I was worried about trying the tacos but once they were on the table I was excited to try them! Not disapointed at all; they were really delicious, at least the steak and chicken ones I had were. They had plenty of meat and came with a side of mexican rice and black beans. Paired up with a giant margarita, Taco Tuesday was perfect here! It was a full house for the Happy Hour which goes from 4pm-10pm, everyone enjoying a conversation over sports, food, and drinks.

Since it gets really busy, service isn't as quick but thats understandable. All the servers are very nice. I've never had a issue with customer service here. Parking sucks, but if you are lucky you might just get a meter right outside or there is also valet across the street and a parking lot at the end of the street.</review>

<review>You really can't miss Cabo Cantina when walking on the street here because of the crowd and the general rukus (popular here). I found Cabo to be true to my other Cabo experience in Pacific Beach (party town numero uno). If you like this type of energy then this will be your vehicle of happiness.

Surprisingly the overall ratings are only 3.5. My question is how can a place be this popular, crowded most of the time and get this low of a rating. Perhaps those that enjoy the vibe are not the type to do a review (ever think of that). Sometimes the most demonstrative visitor is someone that may have had an off experience. They almost always give the lowest 1 Star rating; when in general they should expect to have some attitude because of the mix of alcohol and average tolerance to the spirits.

I barely write reviews because I dnt wanna take the time to talk about a place unless it really deserves it. I have never been to a place that treats you with such disrespect. This cabo cantina needs to take some pointers from the other locations like the one in West Hollywood.  I get it it's like the "Mexican style" bar and grill so you don't expect much. But you should at least be treated like a customer. First the blended Mega Margarita that I split with my friends was really icy. It taste like a slurpee from 7 11 that was really watered down. Way to much ice. I coulnt even taste the flavor I got let alone the alcohol. But I drank it anyway. Didn't bother to tell the server. We also got nachos which was great. Then I ordered buy one get one Margarita on ice which was really good. The problem didn't really come until we got the bill. The server (I dnt know her name but seems to be a dark hair white girl)  wrote 20% of 100 =$20 on the ticket. I'm a server my friends are servers so we felt really disrespected at the fact that she wrote it on the bill. Like we were going to do it anyway because we are of the industry but she didn't have to write it on the bill. We felt because we are a diverse group of minorities she had a need to write it on the bill. Some restaurants have the percentages PRINTED at the bottom for your convenience, but she flat out wrote it with her pen. When we asked her about it she brushed it off and said it was a bad habit. So then we start to wonder if this is policy so we called a manager( a seemingly white male named Guy )over. Before he came I saw her debrief him of what happen (which was really nothing). When he came he seem to already know what he was gonna say. When we asked him if it's policy he said yes because we have a lot of tourists come here. Then I said tourist are not you shouldn't try to force tip out of pple. Then he said its policy and its not going to change. And then said every cabo cantina is different.  I thought to myself yes every one is different, they aren't racist. The manager NAMED GUY was very rude. When I asked him for his name he said it was Guy and then he asked for mine and I said no. Which seem to really piss him off. It then Looked like he gestured to security to kick us out. They didn't get a chance to we were leaving anyway. My thing is you never know who you are going to get we were going to tip 20% anyway. Because of the manager we tipped her NOTHING. She wasnt a good server anyway. The team is only as good as the leader and the leader sucks. Not coming here again. I'll stick to what I know.</text>

I thought to myself yes every one is different, they aren't racist. The manager NAMED GUY was very rude. When I asked him for his name he said it was Guy and then he asked for mine and I said no. Which seem to really piss him off. It then Looked like he gestured to security to kick us out. They didn't get a chance to we were leaving anyway. My thing is you never know who you are going to get we were going to tip 20% anyway. Because of the manager we tipped her NOTHING. She wasnt a good server anyway. The team is only as good as the leader and the leader sucks. Not coming here again. I'll stick to what I know.</text>

I barely write reviews because I dnt wanna take the time to talk about a place unless it really deserves it. I have never been to a place that treats you with such disrespect. This cabo cantina needs to take some pointers from the other locations like the one in West Hollywood.  I get it it's like the "Mexican style" bar and grill so you don't expect much. But you should at least be treated like a customer. First the blended Mega Margarita that I split with my friends was really icy. It taste like a slurpee from 7 11 that was really watered down. Way to much ice. I coulnt even taste the flavor I got let alone the alcohol. But I drank it anyway. Didn't bother to tell the server. We also got nachos which was great. Then I ordered buy one get one Margarita on ice which was really good. The problem didn't really come until we got the bill. The server (I dnt know her name but seems to be a dark hair white girl)  wrote 20% of 100 =$20 on the ticket. I'm a server my friends are servers so we felt really disrespected at the fact that she wrote it on the bill. Like we were going to do it anyway because we are of the industry but she didn't have to write it on the bill. We felt because we are a diverse group of minorities she had a need to write it on the bill. Some restaurants have the percentages PRINTED at the bottom for your convenience, but she flat out wrote it with her pen. When we asked her about it she brushed it off and said it was a bad habit. So then we start to wonder if this is policy so we called a manager( a seemingly white male named Guy )over. Before he came I saw her debrief him of what happen (which was really nothing). When he came he seem to already know what he was gonna say. When we asked him if it's policy he said yes because we have a lot of tourists come here. Then I said tourist are not you shouldn't try to force tip out of pple. Then he said its policy and its not going to change. And then said every cabo cantina is different.  I thought to myself yes every one is different, they aren't racist. The manager NAMED GUY was very rude. When I asked him for his name he said it was Guy and then he asked for mine and I said no. Which seem to really piss him off. It then Looked like he gestured to security to kick us out. They didn't get a chance to we were leaving anyway. My thing is you never know who you are going to get we were going to tip 20% anyway. Because of the manager we tipped her NOTHING. She wasnt a good server anyway. The team is only as good as the leader and the leader sucks. Not coming here again. I'll stick to what I know.<//Review>

< review>
Went here Monday and saw Tuesday they had charged my card 4 times, totaling an amount of over $120. When I called and asked what happened, the guy told me that they charge everyones cards before they close their tab, then charge the real amount. Well, I got charged 4 times when I should have been charged just twice, the guy told me to wait a couple days and if it doesnt go back to the card to call again. Well its saturday and its still there! so for people who dont check theyre statements you should after coming to this place. My friends and coworkers are never coming here again and we work in a restaurant! I cant even imagine how many people are screwed over by this, they dont even tell you before they do it and hope you dont notice the extra money in their pocket. Thanks to them I missed a bill and now I owe even more money because they wouldnt transfer the money back in time.
THANKS CABO YOURE NOT WORTH IT. The Whaler next store is way cleaner and they dont charge you ILLEGAL charges, which they should at least tell you in advance!!< /review>

First restaurant I have been in the whole world that took away my credit card before taking any order, thinking I will not pay after eating! Can't believe this is in the US, been all over Asia & Europe and nowhere I was told we need keep your credit card as a guarantee before serving you food!< /review>

<Text>I went last night. HORRIBLE experience. Never will I return to this cabo again. The waitress told me and my family that if we don't tip her she will stop serving us. That is what u call bad customer service. And the manager agreed with her. My husband told her don't charge the card I'll give cash and she looked at him ignored him and charged it to the card anyway. I believe her name was ellie rude worker.</Text>< Pictures>

Two floors, always packed at nights, average service.  Cheap low quality food and average beer.  Noisy inside, hard to find parking outside, unwelcoming atmosphere.  Tiny bathroom that always has a long line.<//Review>

<Review>Good environment. Drinks are decent, very sweet for the most part lots of juice not much liquor. Food is good, nothing out of the ordinary. Good Mexican food that will leave you full. Nachos and margaritas are my go to!
Beware of them double charging your card and staff for the most part isn’t friendly.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) to access the room, the security asks for an ID to see if you are of legal age.
You can sit where there is a seat, to order you have to give a credit card or money as a "deposit". Music a little too loud as there is already a lot of people buzzing.
Average cocktails in both quality and price.

(Original)
per accedere al locale la security chiede ID per vedere se si è maggiorenni.
Ci si può sedere dove si trova posto, per ordinare bisogna dare la carta di credito o dei soldi come "cauzione". Musica un po troppo alta dato che già c'è molto brusio della gente.
Cocktail nella media sia come qualità che come prezzo.< /review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Practically by the sea, amazing food, spectacular Margaritas and ... good company! ;-)
It is also a safe place, where bands and team caps are prohibited, so as to avoid fights.
Absolutely recommended!

(Translated by Google) My partner and I went to eat and just sat at the table, the cards were stuck from the dirt that was on it. We decided to eat there as the price seemed reasonable, except for the drinks that were not on the menu. When he brings us the bill, we see that 2 beers cost us $ 14.50. And also the waitress, despite not being attentive and a bit pushy, tells us that we should leave a tip (18% of the amount of the ticket). We asked him if it was compulsory and he told us that if with all the nose, now we know that it is not. Terrible service (except for the guy) and price. DO NOT GO

(Original)
Fuimos a comer mi pareja y yo y sólo sentarnos en la mesa, las cartas estaban pegadas de la suciedad que había en la misma. Decidimos comer allí ya que el precio parecía razonable, menos el de las bebidas que no aparecía en la carta. Cuando nos trae la cuenta, vemos que 2 cervezas nos costaron 14,50$. Y además la camarera a pesar de no ser atenta y un poco prepotente, nos dice que debemos de dejarle propina (18% del importe del ticket). Le preguntamos si era obligatorio y nos dijo que si con todo el morro, ahora sabemos que no lo es. Pésimo servicio (excepto por el chico)  y precio. NO VAYAS</Review>
